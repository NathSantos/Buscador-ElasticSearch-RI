I also acknowledge their constructive criticism which has supported an important \n\ndevelopment of my investigation skills throughout these years. Thanks to all these facts this thesis \n\nhas reached its end, and I hope in a satisfactory way for all. \n\n \n\nSecondly, I would like to thank my family. \n\nSpecial emphasis to my parents, which throughout all my life have encouraged my beliefs and \n\nmy life goals. Amongst these, of course my passion for Meteorology is included. And undoubtedly \n\nthey have motivated me to perform my academic education until this point of finishing a PhD. \n\n \n\nI must also extend my gratitude to all the researchers who have participated in the investigation \n\nand peer-review processes throughout my PhD. Without their participation, ideas and effort, none \n\nof the published papers presented in this thesis would reach such a satisfactory level. \n\n \n\nFinally, a special thank you to all my friends. \n\nA warm salutation to all my dearest friends, ranging from work colleagues to long-time friends \n\nfrom my childhood who remain close to me. Friends are a really important part and balance in my \n\nlife, balance without I am sure I would not be able to succeed in my professional and academic \n\nlife! \n\n \n\nThis PhD was supported by the following FCT grant: SFRH/BD/84395/2012 \n\n  \n\n\n\nii \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\niii \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nBlocking high pressure systems are large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns with \n\nmeteorological impacts that vary across regions and seasons, depending on the blocking location, \n\nspatial characteristics and temporal length. While blocking episodes are an important component \n\nof intra-seasonal and inter-annual variability at mid-latitudes, particularly in Europe, previous \n\nstudies have mostly focused on characterizing European blocking impacts on either winter or \n\nsummer seasons. In this thesis, a thorough characterization of Euro-Atlantic blocking occurrence \n\nwithin different longitudinal sectors (Atlantic, European and Russian) was performed, followed \n\nby a comprehensive analysis of their seasonal impacts on temperature and on the precipitation \n\nregimes of the European continent and specific sub-regions, with particular emphasis on Iberia, \n\nand on extreme events. In order to distinguish high-latitude blocking from other common high \n\npressure systems affecting Europe, namely sub-tropical ridges, a novel ridge detection scheme was \n\ndeveloped. Ridges do not require a wave-breaking occurrence as blockings do, although they are \n\nfrequent precursors of wave-breaking, which may lead to blocking. Thus, as an additional novelty, \n\nthis thesis also characterizes the distinctive seasonal impacts associated with sub-tropical ridges \n\noccurring at different longitudinal sectors of the Euro-Atlantic region. Finally, an assessment of \n\nthe involved mechanisms behind the temperature and precipitation responses to blocking is also \n\ncarried out. This included for precipitation the role of cyclonic activity (storm-tracks and cut-off \n\nlows), moisture transport, and large-scale atmospheric instability, while for temperature the focus \n\nwas on the role played by horizontal advection, subsidence and imbalances in various radiation \n\nbudgets.   \n\nThis distinction clarifies that most extreme heat episodes in southern Europe and Mediterranean \n\nareas should not be attributed to blockings, but rather to ridges. In central and northern areas of \n\nthe continent, both regimes are responsible for warm conditions in summer, due to enhanced \n\nradiative heating and increased subsidence. During winter, blocking and ridges lead to opposite \n\ntemperature responses. Blocking reinforces cold northerly advection in its eastern flank, thus \n\npromoting European cold winter spells, especially those located in the eastern Atlantic and western \n\nEurope, while mild Atlantic flows associated to ridge patterns result in warmer conditions.  \n\nRegarding the impacts on precipitation, blocking and ridges are associated with a marked north-\n\nsouth dipole for the three considered longitudinal sectors of occurrence. While blocking patterns \n\nforce a split of the storm-track, ridges are associated with a stronger zonal flow at higher latitudes. \n\nThus, negative (positive) precipitation anomalies during blocks occur at higher (lower) latitudes. \n\nEnhanced atmospheric instability and cyclonic activity south of blocking centers relate very well \n\nwith increased rainfall in southern Europe, including Iberia, where torrential regimes are more \n\nrelevant in the precipitation totals. This dipole is reversed during ridges, which lead to dry \n\nconditions in southern Europe. The seasonal analysis further reveals that winters characterized by \n\nhigh frequencies of blocking (ridge) occurrence present above (below) average snow covered soils. \n\nBlocking/ridge impacts on temperature and precipitation have also additional effects on \n\nmeteorological and climate extreme events with large socio-economic impacts. Thus, the results \n\nshow a blocking/ridge role at different time-scales in controlling a significant part of wildfire inter-\n\n\n\niv \n\n \n\nannual variability in Mediterranean areas. Meteorological pre-conditioning raises vegetation stress \n\nduring dry winters, while increased ridge and blocking occurrence in summer fosters \n\nmeteorological conditions which are prone to fire ignition and spread. Finally, outputs from state-\n\nof-the-art General Circulation Models raise the challenge to develop further these automated \n\nschemes for blocking/ridges detection, as their representation in climate models is crucial to \n\nunderstand impacts towards the later decades of the 21st century. \n\nSumming up, the main novelties and achievements of this thesis are: 1) the clear disentanglement \n\nbetween blocks and ridges; 2) the seasonal analyses of specific regional impacts resulting from \n\ndifferent locations of blocking/ridge structures; 3) the detailed analysis of dynamical/physical \n\nforcing mechanisms associated to each considered weather pattern. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Atmospheric blocking, Sub-tropical ridges, Climate variability, Europe, Atlantic, \n\nImpacts, Precipitation, Temperature, Droughts, Wildfires. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nv \n\n \n\nResumo \n\nApesar de n\u00e3o existir uma defini\u00e7\u00e3o unanimemente aceite para o conceito de bloqueio \n\natmosf\u00e9rico, este pode ser descrito como uma supress\u00e3o do fluxo zonal devido \u00e0 presen\u00e7a de \n\num sistema de alta press\u00e3o. Esta circula\u00e7\u00e3o anticicl\u00f3nica, normalmente localizada nas latitudes \n\nonde se observa a corrente de jato polar, apresenta uma dimens\u00e3o espacial de larga-escala, \u00e9 \n\ngeralmente quase-estacion\u00e1ria, e tem um tempo de vida \u00fatil entre v\u00e1rios dias a v\u00e1rias semanas. \n\nOs sectores orientais dos oceanos Atl\u00e2ntico e Pac\u00edfico s\u00e3o geralmente as regi\u00f5es de ocorr\u00eancia \n\npreferencial de bloqueios no Hemisf\u00e9rio Norte. A ocorr\u00eancia de bloqueios atmosf\u00e9ricos est\u00e1 \n\ndiretamente associada a condi\u00e7\u00f5es prolongadas de tempo seco e est\u00e1vel nas regi\u00f5es diretamente \n\nlocalizadas sob o sistema de altas press\u00f5es. O seu posicionamento geralmente origina uma \n\ndivis\u00e3o em dois ramos da corrente de jato. Esta perturba\u00e7\u00e3o do habitual padr\u00e3o zonal resulta em \n\naltera\u00e7\u00f5es significativas das condi\u00e7\u00f5es meteorol\u00f3gicas a outras latitudes (tanto meridional como \n\nsetentrional) distintas da zona diretamente afetada pela posi\u00e7\u00e3o central do bloqueio. \n\nTorna-se necess\u00e1ria assim uma compreens\u00e3o mais detalhada da climatologia associada aos \n\nbloqueios atmosf\u00e9ricos centrados no setor Euro-Atl\u00e2ntico, com especial \u00eanfase aos impactos \n\nespec\u00edficos associados \u00e0s diferentes localiza\u00e7\u00f5es que os seus centros de a\u00e7\u00e3o possam ter. Apesar \n\nde serem um fen\u00f3meno que ocorre \u00e0 escala sin\u00f3ptica, os bloqueios podem implicar impactos \n\nclim\u00e1ticos muito distintos \u00e0 escala regional, ou mesmo local. Desta forma, um dos principais \n\nobjetivos desta tese centra-se na elabora\u00e7\u00e3o de uma climatologia completa da sua ocorr\u00eancia, e \n\nna respetiva caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o dos impactos clim\u00e1ticos regionais resultantes da ocorr\u00eancia de \n\nbloqueios em diferentes sectores longitudinais: Atl\u00e2ntico (ATL; 30W-0W), Europeu (EUR; 0E-\n\n30E) e Russo (RUS; 30E-60E).  \n\nTendo-se verificado na literatura uma certa confus\u00e3o entre bloqueio de alta latitude e outros \n\nsistemas comuns de alta press\u00e3o que afetam a Europa, nomeadamente as cristas sub-tropicais, \n\nfoi considerado priorit\u00e1rio obter um novo cat\u00e1logo de cristas de alta press\u00e3o para o setor Euro-\n\nAtl\u00e2ntico. Desta forma, um segundo objetivo central da tese foi o do desenvolvimento de um \n\nnovo algoritmo autom\u00e1tico de dete\u00e7\u00e3o de cristas sub-tropicais, que permita assim realizar uma \n\nclara distin\u00e7\u00e3o fenomenol\u00f3gica e dos impactos destes dois padr\u00f5es atmosf\u00e9ricos (bloqueios \n\nversus cristas). Assim, a compreens\u00e3o das condi\u00e7\u00f5es sin\u00f3pticas e dos mecanismos f\u00edsicos \n\nenvolvidos em cada um destes padr\u00f5es \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m tema central desta tese. No caso da \n\nprecipita\u00e7\u00e3o, esta an\u00e1lise de mecanismos incluiu o papel da atividade cicl\u00f3nica (storm-tracks e \n\ncut-off lows), do transporte de humidade e da instabilidade atmosf\u00e9rica em larga escala. Para \n\navaliar os impactos na temperatura analisou-se a contribui\u00e7\u00e3o da advec\u00e7\u00e3o horizontal, da \n\nsubsid\u00eancia e das altera\u00e7\u00f5es nos v\u00e1rios balan\u00e7os radiativos. \n\nA desagrega\u00e7\u00e3o bloqueios-cristas permite distinguir fenomenologias por vezes confundidas \n\nna literatura, nomeadamente aquando da an\u00e1lise de epis\u00f3dios de calor extremo no sul da Europa. \n\nVerifica-se dos resultados obtidos que, devido a uma clara distin\u00e7\u00e3o no posicionamento \n\nlatitudinal dos centros de a\u00e7\u00e3o entre bloqueios e cristas, as respostas na temperatura associadas \n\na cada padr\u00e3o s\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m bem distintas, sendo estas diferen\u00e7as particularmente not\u00e1veis no \n\ninverno. De uma forma geral, nesta esta\u00e7\u00e3o, os bloqueios (essencialmente os centrados nos \n\n\n\nvi \n\n \n\nsectores ATL e EUR) resultam em valores das temperaturas do ar bastante abaixo da m\u00e9dia, \n\nprovocadas pela advec\u00e7\u00e3o de ar frio de latitudes mais elevadas ao longo do flanco este dos \n\nanticiclones. Em oposi\u00e7\u00e3o, as cristas originam anomalias positivas na temperatura na maior \n\nparte do continente europeu, essencialmente como resultado do transporte de massas de ar de \n\norigem Atl\u00e2ntica, e de uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o do arrefecimento radiativo, associado ao aumento da \n\nnebulosidade. Durante o ver\u00e3o, ambos os padr\u00f5es atmosf\u00e9ricos est\u00e3o associados a temperaturas \n\nacima da m\u00e9dia em vastas \u00e1reas da Europa central e do norte. Em contrapartida, nas regi\u00f5es \n\nmais a sul, e em particular na \u00e1rea da bacia do Mediterr\u00e2neo, as cristas controlam a ocorr\u00eancia \n\nde dias extremamente quentes (usualmente identificados como ondas de calor). No ver\u00e3o \u00e9 \n\ntamb\u00e9m de salientar o papel dominante do aquecimento radiativo solar (sob condi\u00e7\u00f5es de c\u00e9u \n\nlimpo) como principal impulsionador destas anomalias positivas de temperatura em dias de \n\nocorr\u00eancia de bloqueio/crista, particularmente para os sistemas localizados sobre \u00e1reas \n\ncontinentais. \n\nRelativamente aos impactos nos regimes de precipita\u00e7\u00e3o, existe um claro dipolo norte-sul ao \n\nanalisar as anomalias associadas a dias de bloqueio/crista. A ocorr\u00eancia de bloqueios leva a uma \n\nredu\u00e7\u00e3o da precipita\u00e7\u00e3o na metade norte do continente Europeu (em algumas \u00e1reas superior a \n\n50%) devido ao bloqueio dos sistemas depression\u00e1rios de m\u00e9dias-latitudes (e do correspondente \n\ntransporte de humidade) provenientes do Atl\u00e2ntico. No entanto, esta configura\u00e7\u00e3o sin\u00f3ptica leva \n\na um aumento da precipita\u00e7\u00e3o (relativamente \u00e0 m\u00e9dia) nas zonas mais a sul, fundamentalmente \n\nrelacionado com o desvio do storm-track nesta dire\u00e7\u00e3o, e a um consequente aumento da \n\ninstabilidade atmosf\u00e9rica e da convec\u00e7\u00e3o. Este padr\u00e3o resulta numa clara mudan\u00e7a nas \n\ndistribui\u00e7\u00f5es de regimes de precipita\u00e7\u00e3o nos pa\u00edses do sul da Europa, e demonstra tamb\u00e9m a \n\nliga\u00e7\u00e3o entre bloqueios atmosf\u00e9ricos e os regimes de precipita\u00e7\u00e3o torrencial na \u00e1rea do \n\nMediterr\u00e2neo. Em padr\u00f5es de fluxo zonal intenso as anomalias da precipita\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00e3o no geral \n\nopostas \u00e0s encontradas durante bloqueios, originando um deficit de precipita\u00e7\u00e3o no sul da \n\nEuropa. No contexto dos v\u00e1rios regimes poss\u00edveis de fluxo zonal forte, as cristas sub-tropicais \n\nest\u00e3o associadas a condi\u00e7\u00f5es particularmente secas nos pa\u00edses do sul da Europa. Isto \n\nnaturalmente tamb\u00e9m se aplica \u00e0 Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica, onde os totais anuais de precipita\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndependem largamente da atividade frontal de origem Atl\u00e2ntica (em particular nos meses de \n\ninverno), sendo esta afastada da regi\u00e3o durante a ocorr\u00eancia de cristas nos sectores ATL e EUR. \n\nNeste contexto, mostra-se crucial o recurso a bases de dados de alta-resolu\u00e7\u00e3o com uma \n\ndensidade de esta\u00e7\u00f5es muito mais elevada, permitindo uma an\u00e1lise regional mais detalhada para \n\no dom\u00ednio da Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica. \n\n Os bloqueios centrados em latitudes elevadas, em particular os que ocorrem no sector ATL, \n\ns\u00e3o respons\u00e1veis por invernos com maior cobertura de neve no continente Europeu (at\u00e9 cerca \n\nde 50% mais dias com a superf\u00edcie coberta de neve na Europa central), devido a uma maior \n\nfrequ\u00eancia de dias frios sob os fluxos de norte associados \u00e0 circula\u00e7\u00e3o anticicl\u00f3nica. Por outro \n\nlado, a ocorr\u00eancia de cristas nos sectores ATL e EUR (que est\u00e3o associadas a dias de inverno \n\nbastante amenos) imp\u00f5e uma frequ\u00eancia muito mais baixa de dias com neve no solo. \n\nFoi tamb\u00e9m conclu\u00eddo que os padr\u00f5es de bloqueio/crista exercem um efeito regulador \n\nimportante na variabilidade inter-anual de inc\u00eandios florestais. Mostra-se que o feedback \n\n\n\nvii \n\n \n\nexistente entre a ocorr\u00eancia destes padr\u00f5es atmosf\u00e9ricos, a ocorr\u00eancia de secas, e os inc\u00eandios \n\nflorestais, acontece a diferentes escalas temporais. Nos meses antecedentes \u00e0 \u00e9poca de \n\ninc\u00eandios, uma frequ\u00eancia superior ao normal de cristas (bloqueios) \u00e9 respons\u00e1vel por valores \n\nde precipita\u00e7\u00e3o abaixo (acima) da m\u00e9dia no sul da Europa, aumentando a vulnerabilidade da \n\nvegeta\u00e7\u00e3o. Durante a pr\u00f3pria \u00e9poca de inc\u00eandios, este padr\u00e3o atmosf\u00e9rico est\u00e1 associado a \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es anomalamente quentes e secas que promovem a igni\u00e7\u00e3o e f\u00e1cil propaga\u00e7\u00e3o do fogo. \n\nFinalmente, no contexto das altera\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas, verificou-se que nas \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas a \n\nfrequ\u00eancia de cristas sub-tropicais aumentou bastante no sul da Europa. As proje\u00e7\u00f5es futuras \n\ndos Modelos de Circula\u00e7\u00e3o Geral sugerem uma expans\u00e3o para norte das altas press\u00f5es sub-\n\ntropicais (associadas \u00e0 expans\u00e3o da c\u00e9lula de Hadley). Por outro lado, n\u00e3o existem sinais \n\ndin\u00e2micos de altera\u00e7\u00f5es muito significativas na frequ\u00eancia e localiza\u00e7\u00e3o dos bloqueios de alta \n\nlatitude no sector Euro-Atl\u00e2ntico, exceto uma ligeira tend\u00eancia de deslocamento para nordeste \n\nna sua regi\u00e3o preferencial de ocorr\u00eancia. Pretende-se como trabalho futuro utilizar tamb\u00e9m uma \n\nabordagem din\u00e2mica (n\u00e3o apenas baseada em campos de anomalia) para o algoritmo de dete\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde cristas, que permitir\u00e1 uma maior confian\u00e7a na extrapola\u00e7\u00e3o para cen\u00e1rios futuros.  \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Bloqueios atmosf\u00e9ricos, Cristas sub-tropicais, Variabilidade clim\u00e1tica, \n\nEuropa, Atl\u00e2ntico, Impactos, Precipita\u00e7\u00e3o, Temperatura, Secas, Inc\u00eandios. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nviii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nix \n\n \n\nContents \n\n \n\n \n\nList of Acronyms and Abbreviations                 xi \n\nList of Figures               xiii \n\nList of Tables               xvii \n\n \n\n1.

Introduction \n \n\n2 \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n \n\n3 \n \n\n1.1 Large-scale variability and the European climate \n \n\nAlthough Europe lies within the northern temperate climate zone, its relative large extension \n\nencloses a wide range of different climates (Barry and Chorley, 2010). Kottek et al (2006) have \n\ndeveloped an updated version of the K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climatic classification map that is shown \n\nhere for the European continent (Fig 1.1). While oceanic climate classifications predominate in \n\nwestern sectors, temperate and cool continental climates are characteristic of eastern and \n\nnorthern countries. The Mediterranean basin is dominated by warm and temperate Mediterranean \n\nclasses, which are characterized by wet winter and dry and hot summers (see Fig. 1.1). The \n\nprevailing westerly zonal flow and the associated Jetstream control a large fraction of the \n\nEuropean climate, although disruptions of the Jetstream frequently alter significantly the usual \n\nprecipitation and temperature distributions. A large part of the inter-annual variability in \n\nEuropean weather is modulated by a few synoptic structures (e.g. the Azores high, Iceland low, \n\nJetstream, storm-tracks). Amongst them, quasi-stationary high pressure systems referred to as \n\nblocking, are one of the main weather regimes disrupting the mean European conditions (Rex, \n\n1950a,b). \n\n \n\nFig. 1.1 European map of updated K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification. Adapted from Kottek et al., \n\n2016.  \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n \n\n4 \n \n\n \n\nIn order to frame a large-scale phenomenon such as blocking, in terms of climatology and \n\nimpacts over the European continent, as intended throughout this thesis, it is firstly required to \n\npresent the main large-scale atmospheric variability modes that affect the study area at different \n\ntime scales. In the following sub-sections, the links between these circulation modes (as well as \n\nother remote atmospheric and oceanic phenomena) and the European climate variability at \n\ndifferent time-scales (from a long-term perspective to inter-annual variations), are briefly \n\ndescribed, taking also into account the Mediterranean environment. \n\n \n\n1.1.1 Inter-decadal and inter-annual temperature variability \n\nAt long temporal scales, the rate of global warming in the post-industrial era is unprecedented \n\n(Luterbacher et al., 2004; Mann et al. 2009; Ljungqvist et al., 2012) and leads to a generalized \n\nconsensus on an anthropogenic fingerprint (Cook et al., 2013; Fischer and Knutti, 2015). An \n\napparent hiatus in this steep recent warming trend has been discussed in recent years (e.g. \n\nSeneviratne et al., 2014). However, the successive record temperature years at the global scale, \n\nincluding 2014, 2015 and 2016 have now undermined the concept of hiatus (e.g. Su et al., 2017).  \n\nSuperimposed on this long-term trend, the mean temperature in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) \n\nduring the 20th century has been characterized by a multi-decadal warming-cooling-warming \n\npattern (Li et al., 2013), with the latter being particularly notable through the early stages of the \n\n21st century. The work by Pe\u00f1a-Ortiz et al. (2015) corroborates a similar behavior in the \n\nEuropean region, as the authors refer to a shortening of the summer season in Europe throughout \n\nthe 1950-1978 period, and a notable lengthening in the post-1979 period. To understand the \n\nmulti-decadal changes within the long-term temperature trend it is mandatory to take into \n\naccount the effects of internal variability, including several oscillatory phenomena associated \n\nwith Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies, such as the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation \n\n(AMO) or the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). A close relation between the AMO phase and \n\nthe mean temperature of the NH and the European continent has been reported by several authors \n\n(Li et al., 2013; Mann et al., 2014; Pe\u00f1a-Ortiz et al., 2015; Zampieri et al., 2016), with the \n\ncooling phases of the AMO signal likely offsetting some of the anthropogenic warming (see Fig. \n\n1.2). G\u00e1miz-Fortis et al. (2011) have shown that the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) of the \n\nAtlantic Ocean is able to  account  for  about  12%  of  the  north-western  European  land \n\nsurface temperature variance. These authors also stress that the AMO influence on European \n\ntemperature is not only regional-dependent, but also non-stationary in time, as links change \n\nsignificantly throughout the decades.  \n\n \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n \n\n5 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 1.2 a) The 11-year running mean (red line) Northern Hemisphere temperature (NHT) anomalies \n\nfrom the HadCRUT4 dataset, relative to the base period 1961?1990. The black line shows the global \n\natmospheric CO2 concentrations. b) The 11-year running means of the de-trended Northern \n\nHemisphere Temperature (DNHT), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Atlantic Multi-\n\ndecadal Oscillation (AMO). The pink shaded areas in (a) and (b) show the 2-sigma uncertainty \n\nranges. From Li et al. (2013). \n\n \n\nAt the inter- and intra-annual temporal scales, multi-decadal variability modes, such as the \n\nAMO and PDO are not critical due to the intrinsic mismatch of temporal scales. Instead, \n\nemphasis must be oriented toward large-scale teleconnection patterns which in turn modulate \n\natmospheric circulation conditions at shorter spatio-temporal scales. With this aim, a number of \n\ndifferent methodological approaches have been developed to derive the most important large-\n\nscale patterns of atmospheric circulation, particularly those affecting Europe and North America, \n\nas summarized in major review works (e.g. Wallace and Gutzler, 1981; Yarnal, 1993; Barry and \n\nCarleton 2001). Besides the methodology to extract the relevant atmospheric patterns, many \n\nauthors have been particularly interested in evaluating the associated impacts on the surface \n\nclimate at the continental and regional scales. In Europe, some of the most important circulation \n\npatterns are connected with anomalies of the North Atlantic eddy-driven Jetstream, particularly \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n \n\n6 \n \n\nfor winter. These most relevant circulation modes are depicted in Fig.1.3, namely: a) North \n\nAtlantic Oscillation (NAO); b) East Atlantic (EA); c) East Atlantic / Western Russia (EA/WR); \n\nd) Scandinavian (SCA) patterns. In other seasons, the climate of the region is also influenced by \n\nremote patterns from subtropical latitudes, as well as global phenomena, often involving \n\natmosphere-ocean interactions (Garc\u00eda-Herrera and Barriopedro, 2017). \n\n \nFig. 1.3 Spatial patterns of regression for the Principal Components Analysis of NH geopotential \n\nheight fields at 500 hPa during winter.  \n\n \n\nThe NAO (Fig. 1.3a) is the leading mode of atmospheric circulation variability over the Euro-\n\nAtlantic sector, and is characterized by a seesaw of atmospheric mass between the Iceland Low \n\nand the Azores High (e.g., Hurrell and Deser 2009). On intra-seasonal time-scales, the NAO is  \n\nassociated with variations  in  the  latitude  of  the  North  Atlantic  Jetstream  and  storm-tracks,  \n\nwhile  on the inter-annual time-scales  it  characterizes  changes  in  their  strength (Woollings et \n\nal., 2014). Regarding the European temperature responses to NAO, characterized by warmer \n\nconditions in central and northern Europe during its positive phase, it has been shown that \n\nbesides its phase, the exact location of the NAO centers of action is more determinant in southern \n\nthan in central and northern Europe (e.g. Castro-D\u00edez et al., 2002). Also, the particularities of the \n\nsummer NAO - characterized by a meridional dipole with low pressures over Greenland and high \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n \n\n7 \n \n\npressures over the UK - have also been explored. For example, its positive phase promotes cold \n\nand wet summers in central and eastern Mediterranean (Blad\u00e9 et al. 2012; Mariotti and \n\nDell\u2019Aquila 2012). Other atmospheric circulation patterns (e.g., SCA, EA and EA/WR) become \n\nalso quite relevant in terms of inter-annual variability of temperature at the European and \n\nregional scales (e.g. Trigo et al., 2008; Garc\u00eda-Herrera and Barriopedro, 2017). Fig. 1.4 shows \n\nthe most relevant modes of variability for this variable in European areas, including the \n\nMediterranean basin. \n\n \n\nFig. 1.4 Spatial distribution of the dominant large-scale phenomenon influencing temperature inter-\n\nannual variations during winter (DJF, left panel) and summer (JJA, right panel) seasons of the 1951-\n\n2013 period. Colors identify the large-scale phenomenon with the largest Pearson correlation \n\ncoefficient with seasonal-mean temperature data. Dots highlight areas displaying significant \n\ncorrelations with more than one teleconnection pattern. The following large-scale phenomena are \n\nconsidered in the analysis: North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), East Atlantic pattern (EA), East \n\nAtlantic / Western Russian pattern (EA/WR), Scandinavian pattern (SCA), El Ni\u00f1o index (NINO3.4) \n\nand the high-summer NAO (SNAO). Adapted from Garc\u00eda-Herrera and Barriopedro (2017). \n\n \n\nAs mentioned above, atmospheric teleconnections are closely related to the occurrence of \n\nspecific weather regimes, such as atmospheric blocks, albeit often not explicitly. As better \n\ndescribed in Section 1.2, atmospheric blocking is associated with disruptions of the usual \n\nwesterly flow from a few days to weeks, thus causing significant changes in the synoptic \n\nenvironment (Trigo et al., 2004; Silmann and Croci-Maspolli, 2009), and consequently on the \n\nregional temperature in Europe. This topic will be discussed in detail in Chapter 2. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1.1.2 European temperature extremes \n \n\nThere is a vast literature focusing on European temperature extremes, including both cold and \n\nhot extremes, regional impacts, and the atmospheric circulation patterns which enhance them \n\n(e.g. Barriopedro et al., 2011, Horton et al., 2015). Several studies have pointed that anomalies in \n\nthe North Atlantic atmospheric flow are crucial to modulate winter, spring and autumn \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n \n\n8 \n \n\noccurrences of both cold nights and warm days in Europe (e.g. Andrade et al., 2012; Cattiaux et \n\nal., 2012). More specifically, atmospheric blocking is tightly linked with the occurrence of \n\nextreme temperature events (Trigo et al., 2004; Buehler et al., 2011; Pfahl, 2014), although the \n\nmajority of the studies focus on cold extremes during the winter season only. \n\nIn recent years, some exceptional extreme cold winter episodes have occurred in Europe, such \n\nas the 2009-2010 winter (Cattiaux et al., 2010), driven by record persistent negative phases of the \n\nNAO and enhanced blocking conditions. The late stages of the 2011-2012 winter were also \n\nexceptionally cold over large parts of Europe, and took place after the occurrence of a Sudden \n\nStratospheric Warming episode (WMO, 2012). Further back in time, a close link between \n\nanomalously cold winters in Europe and enhanced blocking occurrence had already been \n\nexplored by Lejen\u00e4s (1989), presenting the winter of 1941-1942 as a vivid example. The \n\nblocking-driven frigid conditions were associated with some of the most poignant episodes of \n\nWorld War II, particularly the dramatic siege of Leningrad. Similarly, the historical cold winter \n\nof 1962-1963, one the bitterest seasons of the 20th century in the UK (see Table 1.1), was \n\nrecently explored by Burt (2013), who reported prolonged cold temperatures that were are only \n\ncomparable to episodes occurring in one of the coldest periods of the last millennium, i.e. during \n\nthe so-called Late Maunder Minimum (LMM, ca. 1685\u20131715 - Wanner et al. 1995; Luterbacher \n\net al. 2001, 2004; Xoplaki et al. 2005). Several studies have suggested that the LMM exhibited \n\nrecurrent winter anticyclonic conditions over eastern Europe (Luterbacher et al. 2001; Jacobeit et \n\nal. 2003; Pauling et al. 2006). More specifically, Wanner et al. (1995) indicated an enhanced \n\nblocking frequency in the 1690\u2019s decade, and Kington (1999) indicated that in the 1698 winter, \n\nthe circulation over the British Isles was dominated by blocking conditions. \n\n \n\nTable 1.1 Ranked coldest top 10 months and winters in Central England, for the period 1659-2013. \n\nFrom Burt (2013). \n\n \n \n\n\n\n1.

The five warmest and coldest summers are highlighted. Gray bars represent the \n\ndistribution for the 1500-2002 period, with a Gaussian fit in black. (Bottom) The running decadal \n\nfrequency of extreme summers, defined as those with temperature above the 95th percentile of the \n\n1500-2002 distribution. A 10-year smoothing is applied. Dotted line shows the 95th percentile of the \n\ndistribution of maximum decadal values that would be expected by random chance. From \n\nBarriopedro et al. (2011). \n \n\nSome of the most remarkable extreme temperature episodes in Europe correspond to recent \n\nmajor summer heatwaves, sometimes coined mega-heatwaves (Barriopedro et al. 2011; Miralles \n\net al., 2014). The striking heatwave of 2003 affected large parts of western and central Europe, \n\nand caused substantial socio-economic impacts, including excessive mortality, damages in \n\nagricultural crops (Poumadere et al., 2005; Garc\u00eda-Herrera et al., 2010) or intensive wildfires \n\n(e.g. Trigo et al., 2006b). This persistent episode, culminating in the first two weeks of August, \n\nreached summer temperature anomalies as large as 5\u00baC (Black et al., 2004). Another outstanding \n\nepisode occurred in the summer of 2010 - the warmest summer at the European scale since at \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n \n\n10 \n \n\nleast 1500 (Barriopedro et al. 2011). This prolonged episode caused unprecedented catastrophic \n\nwildfires, and increased mortality in Russia. These mega-heatwaves lasted for a period longer \n\nthan usual and achieved record-breaking temperatures over extensive swathes of land, thus being \n\nalso unusual from a full summer seasonal perspective (Fig. 1.5). While the exceptional 2010 \n\nRussian event was unambiguously associated with persistent blocking over the area (e.g., \n\nBarriopedro et al. 2011; Dole et al. 2011), the characterization of the weather conditions that \n\noccurred during the mega-heatwave of 2003 was not so clear, with some studies pointing to \n\nblocking systems (e.g., Trigo et al., 2005) and others suggesting an anomalous northward \n\nintrusion of sub-tropical ridges (e.g., Garc\u00eda-Herrera et al. 2010). Given the outstanding effects \n\nof the 2003 event, it is of paramount importance to characterize these two weather systems and \n\ndisentangle their associated impacts. This question will be further addressed in Section 1.2.   \n\n \n\n1.1.3 European precipitation regimes \n \n\nA wide range of approaches to characterize atmospheric circulation and its links with European \n\nprecipitation regimes is available in the literature, ranging from teleconnection patterns to \n\nweather type catalogues (e.g., Barry and Carleton 2001). The role of the NAO has been \n\nrecurrently analyzed, with its positive phase being associated to a stronger Jetstream and wetter \n\nconditions in central and northern areas of Europe (e.g. Trigo et al., 2008), and drier than average \n\nconditions in southern areas of the European continent (Lavers and Villarini, 2013). This dipole \n\nof positive (negative) correlation between the NAO and precipitation in northern (southern) \n\nregions represents the leading canonical correlation mode between atmospheric circulation and \n\nEuropean precipitation inter-annual variability (e.g., Trigo et al., 2008). This signature is \n\nparticularly relevant in autumn, winter and spring, with weaker links obtained in summer, where \n\nthe NAO effects are more restricted to northern areas of the continent and the Balkans (Folland \n\net al., 2009; Blad\u00e9 et al. 2012). Vicente-Serrano and L\u00f3pez-Moreno (2008) have analyzed the \n\nnonstationary influence of the NAO in European precipitation, pointing to inter-decadal shifts in \n\nthe location of the NAO pressure centers, and to a general trend towards a strengthening of the \n\nNAO-precipitation relationship over most of Europe during the 20th century.  \n\nOther teleconnection indices have been widely linked with anomalous European precipitation, \n\nsuch as the SCA (related to high-latitude blocking occurrence over Scandinavia), or the EA \n\npattern (Trigo et al., 2008; Garc\u00eda-Herrera and Barriopedro, 2017). Figure 1.6 shows the \n\nEuropean areas affected by some of the most relevant modes of variability for precipitation inter-\n\nannual variability. The role of global phenomena such as ENSO should also not be disregarded \n\n(Pozo-V\u00e1zquez et al., 2005; Bulic et al., 2012). Taking into account the reasonable predictability \n\nof the ENSO, several authors have explored this link in order to improve the skill of seasonal \n\nforecast for Europe. However, this is not easy to achieve, as the influence of the ENSO signal on \n\nthe European climate is seasonal- and regional-dependent, not linear with respect to the \n\nmagnitude of the ENSO event, and depends on other inter-annual and even inter-decadal \n\nvariability modes (e.g. Br\u00f6nnimann, 2007). \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n \n\n11 \n \n\nAt shorter time scales, several authors have linked Weather Types daily classifications with \n\nprecipitation regimes. For example, Cortesi et al. (2014) used a Lamb classification to analyze \n\nthe spatial variability of Iberian precipitation, following pioneering works in this topic, such as \n\nTrigo and DaCamara (2000). Circulation Weather Types have often been used to characterize \n\nregional responses, as they are usually defined and calibrated on relatively small domains, thus \n\nreflecting atmospheric configurations at synoptic. Differently, European precipitation responses \n\nto large-scale atmospheric systems, such as blocking, can be explored by describing blocking-\n\nrelated synoptic conditions (Trigo et al., 2004). Using this approach, European blocking has been \n\nfound to exert a large influence on winter precipitation over large areas of Europe (Trigo et al., \n\n2004). For seasons other than winter, the impacts of blocking remain unexplored. In addition, a \n\nregional classification of blocking is needed, since blocking occurrence within different \n\nlongitudinal sectors can lead to very distinct synoptic configurations. These questions will be \n\naddressed in Chapter 3, paying special attention to the precipitation responses over the Iberian \n\nPeninsula in Chapter 4. \n\n \n\nFig. 1.6 Spatial distribution of the dominant large-scale phenomenon influencing precipitation inter-\n\nannual variations during winter (DJF, left panel) and summer (JJA, right panel) seasons of the 1951-\n\n2013 period. Colors identify the large-scale phenomenon with the largest Spearman correlation \n\ncoefficient with seasonal-mean precipitation data. Dots highlight areas displaying significant \n\ncorrelations with more than one teleconnection pattern. The following large-scale phenomena are \n\nconsidered in the analysis: North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), East Atlantic pattern (EA), East \n\nAtlantic / Western Russian pattern (EA/WR), Scandinavian pattern (SCA), El Ni\u00f1o index (NINO3.4) \n\nand the high-summer NAO (SNAO). Adapted from Garc\u00eda-Herrera and Barriopedro (2017). \n\n \n\n1.1.4 Drought conditions throughout the 20th century \n\nDroughts are complex events with severe environmental, economic and social impacts. From a \n\nmeteorological and hydrological point of view, droughts can be defined as shortages in water \n\navailability throughout prolonged periods, which may be considered at different time-scales, \n\ndepending on the specific water resource we are interested in (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2010).  \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n \n\n12 \n \n\nIn Europe, droughts have recurrently affected wet areas, such as western and central Europe \n\n(Rebetez et al., 2006), eastern Europe (Spinoni et al., 2013) or Scandinavia (Hisdal et al., 2006). \n\nSpinoni et al. (2015) have shown that droughts have been more frequent in northern Europe and \n\nRussia in the 1950s and 1960s, whilst for central areas it was during the 1970s, and for southern \n\nEuropean regions in the later decades of the 20th century (see Fig. 1.7). In agreement with such \n\nassessment, Lloyd-Hughes and Saunders (2002) stated that the secular trend in rainfall has been \n\npositive in the region from the Alps to northern Scandinavia, while a drying tendency is found \n\nfor eastern Europe and Mediterranean regions. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 1.7 Annual series of areas in drought conditions (12-month scale) for different European \n\nregions. The bold lines represent the 5-year moving weighted averages. Adapted from Spinoni et al. \n\n(2015). \n\n  \n\nOverall, most concerns have been centered in semi-arid regions, such as southern Europe, and \n\nin particular, over the Mediterranean basin (Hoerling et al., 2012; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2014). \n\nThe observed drying trends (particularly notable in the late 20th century) have persisted during \n\nthe beginning of the 21st century. Major drought episodes have occurred in the western \n\nMediterranean during 2005 (Garc\u00eda-Herrera et al., 2007) and 2012 (Trigo et al., 2013a), with an \n\nalmost continuous drought in the eastern Mediterranean and the contiguous unstable area of the \n\nFertile Crescent (Trigo et al., 2010; Kelley et al., 2015). This has raised concerns on water \n\navailability in the region, especially taking into account the drying and warming projected \n\nscenarios for the Mediterranean area (e.g. Giorgi and Lionello, 2008), with the resulting \n\nincreases in evapotranspiration demand and drought severity (Vicente-Serrano et al. 2010). \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n \n\n13 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 1.8 Percentages of area under wet (blue) and dry (orange) conditions in the Mediterranean \n\nbasin during the 20th century. From Sousa et al. (2011). \n\n \n\nSousa et al. (2011) studied the trends and extremes in drought conditions in the Mediterranean \n\nand a few subareas during the 20th century (Fig. 1.8). They found that the positive phase of the \n\nNAO during winter is the main large-scale circulation pattern driving severe moisture scarceness \n\nin southwestern Europe, while the SCA pattern becomes more relevant for central Mediterranean \n\nareas (in agreement with the precipitation assessment provided in Fig. 1.6). The link between \n\nwater balance and sustained anomalies in European, which are strongly connected to \n\nperturbations in the mean zonal flow, suggests that atmospheric blocking may play a role in the \n\nhydrological balance. This issue will be further discussed in Chapter 5. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n \n\n14 \n \n\n1.2. Atmospheric blocking: climatology and associated \n\nimpacts \n \n\n1.2.1 Blocking definition \n\nThere is no universally accepted definition for atmospheric blocking, although it can be \n\nfundamentally described as a suppression of the normal westerly flow in mid-to-high latitudes \n\ndue to the presence of a relatively stationary high-pressure system. In this sense, several features \n\nare generally accepted as specific characteristics of a standard blocking system, as summarized \n\nby Barriopedro et al. (2010a), namely:  \n\n1) a large-scale high pressure system with a quasi-stationary anticyclonic circulation located \n\non the usual track of the prevailing westerlies; \n\n2) spatio-temporal signatures typical of the large-scale, with lifetimes spanning from a few \n\ndays to several weeks; \n\nThe traditional definition of blocks consists in a split-flow regime, with an associated low-\n\npressure system located southwards of the blocking structure (Rex 1950b). However, such a \n\ndipole is not observed during the so-called Omega block, where the flow reversal is tightly \n\nconnected to a high-latitudinal extension of the sub-tropical ridge belt, and negative anomalies in \n\nthe geopotential height field are located southwest and southeast of the blocking center \n\n(Barriopedro et al., 2006). Two examples of these typical blocking patterns are depicted in Fig. \n\n1.9. \n\n  \n\nFig. 1.9 The 500-hPa height field showing typical blocking patterns: (a) Omega block (6 Mar 1948) \n\nand (b) Rex block (23 Dec1948). From Barriopedro et al. (2006). \n\n \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n \n\n15 \n \n\nThe exact definition of blocking has been a matter of wide discussion in the scientific \n\ncommunity, and several indices and methodologies for detection have been developed. As \n\nexpected, the use of different definitions may result in discrepancies in the blocking \n\nclimatologies, namely in their frequency and location (Barriopedro et al., 2010a). Most of the \n\napproaches have been based on the 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500) or, on dynamical fields \n\n(vertically integrated Potential Vorticity, PV, or Potential Temperature on the dynamical \n\ntropopause, PT). Generally speaking, these algorithms impose certain criteria in terms of \n\nminimum spatial extension and temporal duration (some criteria are objective and other \n\nsubjective). Still, there are profoundly different rationales in these methodologies, particularly in \n\nwhat concerns the use of absolute vs. anomaly (departure) fields. As such, blocking \n\nmethodologies can be classified into two groups:  \n\n1) The flow reversal or wave-breaking approach, which identifies blocks as an easterly \n\ngeostrophic flow around a reference Jetstream latitude, using absolute Z500 or PT fields \n\n(e.g., Tibaldi and Molteni, 1990; Trigo et al., 2004;  Barriopedro et al., 2006); \n\n2) Persistent departures from the climatological mean of the Z500 or PV fields (e.g. Dole \n\nand Gordon, 1983; Knox and Hay, 1985; Schwierz et al., 2004). \n \n\nThese methodologies, originally proposed by Tibaldi and Molteni (1990) and Dole and Gordon \n\n(1983) and, hereafter TM and DG, respectively, have been modified with further features and \n\ncriteria in subsequent works (e.g. Barriopedro et al. 2006, 2010a; Masato et al., 2011).  \n\nAll methods present specific caveats and shortcomings. Regarding the DG index, some of the \n\nmain criticisms are based on the difficulty of defining proper thresholds for blocking detections, \n\nand the fact that a variety of synoptic situations which cannot be defined as blocking may be \n\ndetected as so, such as northward shifts of the jet or amplifications of subtropical or subpolar \n\nanticyclones. Methodologies based on departure fields, such as DG have also the disadvantage of \n\nrequiring longer time-series, in order to create robust climatological reference fields (Barriopedro \n\net al., 2010a). \n\nOn the other hand, the 1-D nature of the TM methodology is a limiting factor, not allowing the \n\n2-D description of the blocking structure. Another limitation of this method has been ascribed to \n\nthe eventual identification of blockings due to the occurrence of cut-off lows. Also, early stages \n\nof block development and some Omega blocks can be missed using this approach, due to the too \n\ndemanding extension and flow reversal criteria. Several modifications to the original algorithm \n\nhave been introduced in order to minimize such problems, including a 2-D extension of the TM \n\nmethod (e.g., Barriopedro et al. 2006; Woollings et al. 2008; Davini et al. 2012a). Using this 2-D \n\ndiagnosis of blocking, Davini et al. (2012a) explored the distinction between high-latitude and \n\nlow-latitude blocking, noting that the latter structures are unable to divert or completely block \n\nthe zonal flow. This example highlights the need to distinguish high- and low-latitudinal high \n\npressure systems and to explore their dynamical characteristics, as detailed in the following sub-\n\nsections. \n\nThroughout this thesis, the climatology of high-latitude blocking and the impacts on the \n\nEuropean continent will be addressed relying on the catalogue developed by Barriopedro et al. \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n \n\n16 \n \n\n(2006), which results from a 2-D adapted version of the Tibaldi and Molteni (1990) index. A \n\nschematic of this automated detection algorithm is presented in Fig. 1.10, using daily Z500 data \n\non a 2.5\u00ba x 2.5\u00ba grid as input.  \n\n \n\nFig. 1.10 Schematic of the automatic blocking detection method used throughout the thesis. From \n\nBarriopedro et al. (2006). \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n \n\n17 \n \n\nAccording to the scheme from Fig. 1.10, two Z500 gradients (GHGN and GHGS) have been \n\nsimultaneously computed for each longitude on the NH and for each day of study, where Z(?,?) \n\nis the Z500 at a given longitude ? and latitude ?. GHGS is proportional to the zonal geostrophic \n\nwind component and provides a measure of the zonal flow intensity for each longitude, while \n\nGHGN is imposed in order to exclude non blocked flows. A given longitude is considered \n\nblocked when both GHGN<-10gpm/\u00ba and GHGS>0gpm/\u00ba for at least one of the five ? values, \n\nevaluated around a reference latitude ?0, and simultaneously the Z(?,?0) anomaly is positive. A \n\nlarge-scale instantaneous blocking pattern is detected when there are at least five blocked \n\nlongitudes. The method includes a tracking algorithm to follow the daily evolution of these \n\nblocking patterns by demanding a minimum overlapping between them, and a blocking event is \n\nsaid to occur when the blocking pattern persists for at least five days. \n\nThis detection scheme also incorporates a procedure to detect the 2-D center of each blocking \n\npattern (defined as the gridpoint with the maximum Z500 within the anticyclonic flow), and the \n\nblocking intensity. The final catalogue includes individual blocking events, tracked on a daily \n\nbasis, with daily information about their central location, longitudinal extension and intensity. In \n\nthis thesis, this daily catalogue is used to identify blocking occurrence in different longitudinal \n\nsectors, according to their central location, as it will be described in detail further ahead in \n\nSection 2.1 \n\nFurthermore, taking advantage of the Z500 gradients (GHGN and GHGS), a catalogue of \n\nstrong zonal westerly flows is also computed, by simply identifying days with zonal flow as \n\nthose characterized by GHGS<22.5gpm/\u00ba, following the approach developed in Trigo et al. \n\n(2004). This distinction between zonal and blocked days will be exploited in the following \n\nChapters. \n\n \n\n1.2.2 Euro-Atlantic blocking climatology \n\nSome fundamental characteristics of blocking climatology in the NH, and in the particular frame \n\nof the Euro-Atlantic sector, are discussed in this section. For this purpose, the blocking catalogue \n\ndescribed in Section 1.2.1 has been used, and several diagnostics such as frequency of \n\noccurrence, mean duration, mean extension, and blocking life-cycles are herein presented. The \n\ncomprehension of these blocking climatological features is an important first step to understand \n\ntheir associated impacts on different meteorological fields at local and regional scales, as it will \n\nbe discussed throughout the remaining chapters of this thesis. \n\nThere are two preferential areas of blocking occurrence in the NH, which overlap with the \n\nclimatological regions of wave amplification and the exit zones of the principal storm-tracks \n\n(i.e., the eastern sides of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, e.g., Barriopedro et al. 2010a). This is \n\nclear in Fig. 1.11, which shows the annual and seasonal frequencies of the blocking centers. The \n\nlargest frequencies are located in the longitudes surrounding the Greenwich Meridian (between \n\nthe British Isles and Scandinavia), and near the international date line in the Pacific area. Even \n\nthough they occur throughout the whole year, blocking is more frequent during winter and spring \n\n(e.g. Tibaldi et al., 1994, Barriopedro et al., 2006; Masato et al., 2011). In summer, there is a \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n \n\n18 \n \n\nsmoother distribution, with a larger tendency for blocking to occur in continental areas and at \n\nhigher latitudes. In the Euro-Atlantic region, this northeastward migration of blocking locations \n\nleads to a third smaller maximum close to the Urals mountain range, a feature already known \n\n(Tibaldi and Molteni, 1990; D\u2019Andrea et al., 1998). In autumn, Pacific blocking occurrence \n\ndecreases, while it persists in the Euro-Atlantic region, although less frequently when compared \n\nto winter and spring. Overall, these preferred locations at the seasonal scale are in agreement \n\nwith those found in other works that used either subjective identification of blocks or detection \n\nschemes based on the TM approach (Treidl et al. 1981; Wiedenmann et al. 2002). \n\nAnnual \n\n \n\nWinter Spring \n\n  \n\nSummer Autumn \n\n  \n \n\n  \n\nFig. 1.11 Climatological mean blocking center frequency (in percentage of days per year/season), \n\ncomputed in boxes of 5\u00bax5\u00ba for the period 1950-2012. \n\n \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n \n\n19 \n \n\nThe duration distribution of NH blocking episodes presents the well-known one side tailed \n\ndistribution (Fig. 1.12). This is observed through the whole year, although long-lasting blocks \n\n(more than 20 days) are more frequent in winter and spring. A similar seasonal behavior is \n\nobserved for the spatial extension of the blocking patterns (not shown), with blocking covering \n\nlarger areas during the coldest seasons of the year.   \n\nAnnual \n \n\n \n\nWinter Spring \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSummer Autumn \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 1.12 Climatological distributions of blocking episodes duration in the Northern Hemisphere for \n\nthe period 1950-2012.  \n\n\n\n1.

The two first (last) days of \n\ndetection within the life cycle of each blocking event were considered for early (mature) stages. \n\n \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n \n\n21 \n \n\nUnderstanding blocking genesis and decay processes throughout the whole blocking life-cycle \n\nis not a simple task. The existent literature on this topic will be discussed in Section 1.2.3. As a \n\nfirst approach on this subject, the preferred locations for blocking genesis and decay are shown \n\nherein in Fig. 1.13. To do so, the differences in the frequencies of blocking center locations \n\nduring their onset (two first days of detection) and decay (last two days of detection) in each \n\ngeographical location ware computed. Taking into account the averaged blocking persistence (~8 \n\ndays), Fig. 1.13 corroborates the quasi-stationary character of blocking, with a slight tendency \n\nfor Euro-Atlantic blocks to slowly migrate eastwards during their lifecycle, and a more unclear \n\ndisplacement pattern for Pacific blocks. \n\n \n\n1.2.3 Blocking life cycle: onset, maintenance and decay \n\nThe life-cycle of blocks is influenced by both large-scale waves and small-scale perturbations \n\n(Nakamura et al., 1997; Tsou and Smith, 1990). The blocking life-cycle has been a widely \n\ndiscussed topic in the literature, both from a dynamical point of view, and also to evaluate the \n\nability of models to represent blocking phenomenology (e.g., D\u2019Andrea et al., 1998; Scaife et al., \n\n2010). A good model performance in simulating blocking becomes relevant in operational \n\nforecasts and climatological contexts, with the latter framing both to model the mid-latitude \n\nclimate, as well to perform reliable climate projections (Barriopedro et al., 2010b; Davini and \n\nD\u2019Andrea, 2016).  \n\n \n\nBlocking precursors and onset \n\nThe onset of blocks is closely related to the amplification of planetary waves and their \n\nunderlying mechanisms, such as: a) planetary wave-wave interaction (\u00c9gger, 1978; Kung et al., \n\n1990; DaCamara et al., 1991), including resonant amplification between free and topographic \n\nRossby waves (Tung and Lindzen 1979), b) non-linear interactions between synoptic and \n\nplanetary-scale waves (Shutts 1983; Tsou and Smith, 1990; Lupo and Smith, 1995). More \n\nspecifically, transient eddy activity is considered to play a crucial role in the genesis and \n\nmaintenance of block, primarily through feedbacks between synoptic eddies and the large-scale \n\nflow (e.g., Yamazaki and Itoh, 2009). \n\nThe precursor role of the synoptic-scale has been widely studied. Altenhoff et al. (2008) \n\nconfirmed the existence of precursor signals several days (up to 10) prior to blocking onset, \n\nnamely: 1) a coherent wave-train emanating approximately 110\u00ba upstream of Atlantic blocking; \n\n2) a long-lived northerly wind signal preceding Pacific blocking. Masato et al. (2011) \n\ndistinguished the influence of cyclonic and anticyclonic wave-breaking towards blocking onset, \n\nas well as the separation between warm/cold air extrusions (as depicted in Fig. 1.14). The authors \n\nfound that anticyclonic breaking dominates over Europe, as previously discussed by Martius et \n\nal. (2007) or Gabriel and Peters (2008), while cyclonic breaking tend to occur mainly over \n\noceanic areas.  \n\n \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n \n\n22 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 1.14 Schematic for the Direction of Breaking (DB) and Relative Intensity (RI) phase space plot. \n\nOn the x-axis is DB, while on the y-axis is RI. Positive values of DB are for anticyclonic wave \n\nbreaking and positive values of RI indicate warm air extrusion dominance. As sketched, a unique \n\nwave-breaking type is identified for each quadrant of this plot. Adapted from Masato et al. (2011). \n\n \n\nMichel et al. (2012) have shown that during the onset of Scandinavian blocks, Atlantic \n\ncyclones display trajectories towards northern Scandinavia, associated with anticyclonic wave-\n\nbreaking in the upper troposphere. With such atmospheric configurations, low PV air masses are \n\nadvected northeastwards contributing to this type of wave-breaking over Europe and preventing \n\nthe occurrence of cyclonic wave-breaking further west. As a consequence, the occurrence of \n\nblocks in the eastern Atlantic is not favored under such atmospheric patterns. On the other hand, \n\nblocks originating in the Atlantic and Greenland area are preceded by a rapid poleward \n\ndeflection of low PV values towards the southeast of Greenland, which acts as a barrier for the \n\ndownstream motion of cyclones, favoring a cyclonic wave-breaking in the Atlantic region. \n\n Croci-Maspolli et al (2007) and Woollings et al. (2008) have explored the dynamical links \n\nbetween blocking and the NAO. Woolings et al. (2010a) further discussed how features such as \n\nthe NAO and EA patterns (which are associated to the location of the eddy-driven jet over the \n\nAtlantic) are closely linked to blocking occurrence. These studies have shown that blocking \n\nreinforces the pre-existing negative NAO phases, and that long-lasting blocks may even instigate \n\nphase changes in the NAO (from positive to negative). Also, blocking genesis locations vary \n\naccording to the NAO phase (Fig. 1.15). Such findings highlight that small-scales may force \n\nlarger-scales.  \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n \n\n23 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 1.15 Distribution of winter blocking genesis (dark dots) and lysis (light dots) with the \n\ncorresponding track lines during a negative, b neutral, c positive NAO phases in the Atlantic region. \n\nThe color scaling indicates four partitions of the index values, namely; blue NAO &lt;\u20130.34; green  \n\nNAO &lt;0; orange NAO > 0; red NAO > 0.52. From Croci-Maspoli et al. (2007). \n\n \n\nMore recently, a particular emphasis has also been devoted to the coupling between \n\nstratospheric dynamics and blocking occurrence, particularly during the incidence of major \n\nSudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs). These SSW events are characterized by a significant \n\nweakening of the polar cyclonic vortex and an abrupt warming of the polar stratosphere during \n\nthe extended winter. SSWs result in stratospheric anomalies that can propagate downwards \n\ntowards the troposphere in the form of negative values of the Northern Annular Mode (NAM, \n\ne.g., Baldwin and Dunkerton 2001). The tropospheric NAM is associated to significant \n\nanomalies in the Jetstream and hence in blocking occurrence (e.g., Davini et al. 2014). \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n \n\n24 \n \n\nInterestingly, the SSW-blocking link is not purely one-directional, and the role of blocks on \n\nforcing SSWs has also been discussed by several authors (e.g. Martius et al., 2009; Nishii et al., \n\n2011; Barriopedro and Calvo 2014).  In addition to internal atmospheric dynamics, external \n\nforcings may also modulate blocking onset, such as: snow cover (Garc\u00eda-Herrera and \n\nBarriopedro, 2006), solar activity (Barriopedro et al., 2008) or the AMO (Martinez, 2014). \n \n\nBlocking maintenance \n\nThe comprehension of processes responsible for blocking maintenance is a complex subject, \n\nwhich led several authors to make use of numerical models.  \n\nWorks such as Green (1977) and Shutts (1983) detail the Eddy Straining Mechanism (ESM), \n\nwhere transient eddies act to maintain the blocking through the input of anticyclonic vorticity to \n\nthe western flank of the block, thus indicating a contribution of the high frequency for the \n\ndevelopment and sustainment of blocks (see Fig. 1.16a). Synoptic eddies are strained by the \n\nblock in the north?south direction, and provide negative (positive) vorticity to the blocking high \n(low), which maintains the blocking dipole against dissipation. The meridional stretching of \n\nRossby waves in the blocked area can in turn result in additional synoptic disturbances (Tanaka \n\n1998). The positive feedback can be lost by a subtle change in the synoptic forcing (Maeda et al. \n\n2000, Arai and Mukougawa 2002). The ESM is not so clear for Omega-type blocks, as a \n\nsplit/meridional dipole is not present. In these blocks, a different mechanism, the Selective \n\nAbsortion Mechanism (Yamazaki and Itoh 2009, see Fig. 1.16b) has been proposed. \n\nAccordingly, the blocking high selectively absorbs the anticyclonic vorticity of the transient \n\nanticyclones, reinforcing its low potential vorticity, while synoptic cyclones will either travel \n\nsouth and downstream of an Omega-type block, or be attracted to the blocking low in a dipole-\n\ntype block, in both cases maintaining the whole blocking structure. \n\nThe important role played by transient eddies in blocking maintenance is well recognized (e.g. \n\nGreen, 1977; Dole, 1986), although some authors consider that these feedbacks are secondary \n\ncontributors, and that low-frequency dynamics should still be considered as the primary driver of \n\nblocking intensification and maintenance (e.g., Nakamura et al. 1997).  \n\n \n\nFig. 1.16 Schematic representation of: a) the Eddy Straining Mechanism; b) the Selective Absorption \n\nProcess. From Yamazaki and Itoh (2009).  \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n \n\n25 \n \n\nBlocking decay \n\nAs discussed above, the planetary scale is very influential in the blocking onset. This is also \n\nvalid regarding the decay phase of blocking systems. Nakamura et al. (1997) attributed blocking \n\ndecay to the low-frequency dynamics, more precisely, to the downstream emanation of a quasi-\n\nstationary Rossby wave train, as also pointed out by Dole (1986, 1989) and Black (1997). Haines \n\nand Holland (1998) suggested that blocking regimes may persist for, as long as, the large-scale \n\nflow remains balanced and does not become unstable or transition to a new state.  \n\nMichel et al. (2012) have shown that during the decay process of Scandinavian blocks, \n\ncyclonic wave-breaking is more frequent than the anticyclonic type. Blocks located in the \n\nreferred area usually decay throughout a transition to a Greenland anticyclone, driven by a \n\nsustained advection of low PV under curved cyclone trajectories over the mid-Atlantic. This \n\nagrees with the previous work of Nakamura et al. (1997), whom already noted an eastward shift \n\nof the low-PV center concurrent with the slow retrograding high pressure center when blocking \n\ndecay begins. Croci-Maspoli et al. (2007) noted that in its decaying phase, blocking is \n\ncharacterized by a strong decrease of the spatial scale irrespective of the block type and \n\ngeographical location. This implies some difficulties for tracking algorithms to correctly \n\ncharacterize the final stages of the blocking life-cycle. \n\n \n\n1.2.4 Sub-tropical ridges \n\nA sub-tropical ridge is often regarded as an extension of the sub-tropical high pressure belt \n\nnorthwards into mid-latitude areas. This atmospheric structure is usually characterized by a \n\nmeridional stretch of anomalously high values in the Z500 field. The synoptic pattern acts as a \n\n\u201cbarrier\u201d for the local westerly flow, thus disturbing the zonal circulation at sub-tropical \n\nlatitudes, similar to the blocking action on the extratropical Jetstream. However, and unlike high-\n\nlatitude blocks, the Jetstream does not split into two branches. Instead, it is reinforced and \n\npushed northwards of the ridge structure, although often embedded in a much larger-scale \n\nmeandering circulation with alternating ridges and troughs (Fig. 1.17). Furthermore, the full \n\nconnection between the ridge structure and the sub-tropical high pressure area prevents a reversal \n\nof the zonal flow on the eastern and western flanks of the system, contrarily to canonical \n\nblocking systems.  \n\nFrom a more dynamical point of view, a sub-tropical ridge is not necessarily accompanied by a \n\nwave-breaking event as blocks do (see Section 1.2.3) and may (or may not) evolve into a \n\nblocking structure at a later stage. In the case of blocking, the early stages may be characterized \n\nby a sub-tropical or an extra-tropical ridge structure, which eventually breaks and becomes \n\npartially or fully isolated from the sub-tropical belt at higher latitudes (Woollings et al., 2011). \n\nAs ridges and blocks may correspond to different stages of the same wave-breaking event, the \n\ndistinction between a more traditional Rex-type block and an Omega-type block should be once \n\nagain considered. Frequently, an Omega block structure represents the intermediate stage \n\nbetween a sub-tropical ridge, and a final isolated Rex block. In fact, in pioneering studies on this \n\ntopic, blocking systems were often defined as \u201cblocking ridges\u201d, although authors were referring \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n \n\n26 \n \n\nspecifically to blocks with wave-breaking (e.g. White and Clark, 1975). Recent works, such as \n\nSantos et al. (2009) or Woollings et al. (2011) have addressed in more detail sub-tropical ridges \n\n(defined as strong persistent ridge events \u2013 SPREs) in the eastern Atlantic area. The latter work \n\nhighlights the differences between ridges occurring with and without posterior Rossby wave-\n\nbreaking, as presented in Fig. 1.18. Ridges with Rossby wave-breaking display similar signatures \n\nto the so-called low-latitude blocking events (Davini et al. 2012a), including a strengthened and \n\nnorthward shifted Jetstream.  \n\n \n\nFig. 1.17 Idealized atmospheric circulation around a sub-tropical ridge in the Northern Hemisphere. \n\nFrom http://www.cmosarchives.ca/ProjectAtmosphere/module9_westerlies_and_the_jet_stream_e.html. \n\n \n\nLow-latitude blocks are very different from high-latitude blocks, which instead, are associated \n\nto a weakening and reversal of the extra-tropical Jetstream. In this sense, attending to the \n\ncharacteristic perturbations that these weather systems impinge on the Jetstream, it can be \n\nconcluded that the low-latitude and high-latitude blocks display larger differences than sub-\n\ntropical ridges with and without Rossby wave-breaking. In order to address the distinct impacts \n\nof these weather systems, it is mandatory to separate high-latitude blocks and subtropical ridges, \n\nthe latter group including both, those with Rossby wave-breaking (i.e., low-latitude blocks) and \n\nthose without it. These low-latitude structures will be named as sub-tropical ridges (or simply \n\nridges) throughout the remaining of the thesis. In order to perform this disentanglement, an \n\nautomated ridge detection algorithm was developed, as published in Sousa et al. (2017b). The \n\ncomplete description of the methodology will be addressed further ahead, in Section 2.1.  \n\nhttp://www.cmosarchives.ca/ProjectAtmosphere/module9_westerlies_and_the_jet_stream_e.html\n\n\n1.

(2011). \n\n \n\n1.2.5 Blocking and ridges impacts \n\nBlocking occurrence is related to anomalous weather conditions over wide areas of the mid and \n\nhigh latitudes. Trigo et al. (2004) firstly explored in a long-term context the European \n\nprecipitation and temperature responses to winter blocking occurrence over the whole Euro-\n\nAtlantic sector (Fig. 1.19). As shown in that study, blocking is associated with prolonged \n\ncloudless and dry periods in the areas under the blocking high. Euro-Atlantic winter blocks also \n\ntend to deflect storm-tracks to northern or southern areas of the continent, often increasing \n\nprecipitation in the Mediterranean (Trigo et al., 2004). On the other hand, the meridional \n\ncirculation associated with blocks favors the advection of cold air from higher latitudes, thus \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n \n\n28 \n \n\npromoting cold winter spells over the European continent (Buehler et al., 2011; Sillmann et al., \n\n2011). However, the regional responses and the involved processes can be highly dependent on \n\nthe specific location of the blocking system (e.g., Garc\u00eda-Herrera et al. 2007), and on the specific \n\nseason in which they occur.   \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFig. 1.19 Upper panels - anomalies of the precipitation rate (shading, mm.day-1) for winter \n\ncomposites of: a) blocking episodes, b) non-blocking episodes, and c) their difference (represented \n\nonly if significant at the 5% level). Solid (dashed) contours in a) and b) show positive (negative) \n\nvalues of the 10 m vorticity anomaly field, with intervals in 0.2\u00b710\u20136 s\u20131. Lower panels: anomalies of \n\nthe daily maximum temperature field (\u00baC) for winter composites of: d) blocking episodes, e) non-\n\nblocking episodes, and f) their difference (represented only if significant at the 1% level). The arrows \n\nin a) and b) show the respective anomaly of the 10 m wind field (m\u00b7s\u20131). From Trigo et al. (2004). \n\n \n\nTherefore, a good characterization of the synoptic environment associated to blocking patterns \n\nis crucial in the assessment of their impacts. In addition, a regional classification of blocking is \n\nmandatory, since blocking occurrence within different sectors of the Euro-Atlantic-Russian area \n\ncan lead to very distinct atmospheric configurations. Taking these facts into account, it was \n\nconsidered a priority in this thesis to: 1) update results from previous works using higher \n\nresolution datasets to better characterize the regional/local responses; 2) characterize the \n\nassociated impacts as a function of the specific blocking location (thus defining distinct \n\nlongitudinal sectors of blocking occurrence); 3) extend previous analyses to other seasons and to \n\nextreme episodes; 4) better characterize the associated synoptic environment and underlying  \n\nprocesses; 5) distinguish the blocking impacts from those associated to ridges, whose effects \n\nhave not been described so far over the European continent. \n\n  \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n \n\n29 \n \n\n1.3 Goals and structure of the thesis \n\nIn this thesis, a thorough description of blocking occurrence and the associated impacts on the \n\nEuropean climate is provided, by distinguishing regional blocking patterns in three sectors within \n\nthe Euro-Atlantic region: a western (Atlantic), a central (European) and an eastern (Russian) \n\nsector. Furthermore, a clear separation between opposite regimes of the Jetstream is explored, by \n\ndistinguishing periods of: 1) strong zonal flow, and 2) high-latitude blocking. Sub-tropical ridges \n\nare herein considered among the synoptic systems that are associated with strong Jetstream \n\nepisodes. The consideration of sub-tropical ridges is further motivated by the need to distinguish \n\nthe impacts of blocking from those associated to high-pressure systems occurring at sub-tropical \n\nlatitudes. This separation is necessary in order to clarify a relatively widespread misusage of \n\nblocking patterns when attributing extreme temperatures events (both hot and cold), a \n\nmisconception that still abounds in the literature. \n\nThus, the main objectives of this thesis are:  \n\n1) Characterize the blocking impacts on the European climate (temperature and precipitation), \n\naccording to their location; \n\n2) Develop a novel detection scheme for sub-tropical ridges; \n\n3) Distinguish the impacts of high-latitude blocking from the ones associated to other large-\n\nscale patterns (zonal flows and ridges), and the underlying processes; \n\n4) Perform a finer description of the aforementioned impacts at the regional scale, with \n\nspecial emphasis on the Iberian Peninsula; \n\n5) Explore impacts on extreme temperature and precipitation events, as well as in derived \n\nfields with socio-economic relevance (e.g. droughts, wildfires). \n\n \n\nThe thesis is structured around three core chapters that correspond to the three published \n\npapers comprising the main outcome of the work performed during the PhD (Sousa et al., 2016, \n\nSousa et al., 2017a and Sousa et al., 2017b). Given that the three papers are integrally presented \n\nas they were published, there are some unavoidable repetitions in the chapter sections addressing \n\ndatasets, methodology and climatologies. It must also be noted that the order of the chapters does \n\nnot follow the chronological order of the publications (taking into consideration the need to \n\npresent the disentanglement between blocking and ridges at an early stage of the thesis). \n\nHowever, some additional unpublished material has been included in the required Chapters to \n\nprovide coherence to the thesis. This extra material corresponds to additional sections in \n\nChapters 3 and 4 and to the outlook of Chapter 5. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n \n\n30 \n \n\n \n\n The thesis is structured as follows: \n\n- Chapter 1 introduced overviews on: 1) the large-scale variability and its influence on the \n\nEuropean climate; 2) blocking definitions, climatology and the dynamics behind its life-cycle, as \n\nwell as the distinction between blocking and ridges.  \n\n- Chapter 2 introduces the methodology used to detect sub-tropical ridges in order to \n\ndistinguish them from high-latitude blocks (Sousa et al., 2017b). A comprehensive \n\ncharacterization of the impacts on European temperature and extreme events associated to both \n\npatterns is then performed, outlining the relative roles of the involved mechanisms. \n\n- Chapter 3 describes the specific impacts of regional blocks on European precipitation, \n\nprecipitation extremes, and the associated synoptic environment (Sousa et al., 2017a). The \n\ndistinct impacts of blocking and strong zonal flow (herein including ridges) regimes on regional \n\nprecipitation distributions are addressed is this chapter. Furthermore, the responses in solid \n\nprecipitation (i.e., snow cover) to regional blocking occurrence are also presented. \n\n- Chapter 4 presents the detailed impacts of blocks in the Iberian Peninsula, relying on \n\nprecipitation (Sousa et al., 2016) and temperature datasets at higher spatial resolutions than those \n\nused in previous chapters. Similar to the larger-scale analyses, changes in the regional \n\nprecipitation distributions, extreme events and the driving mechanisms are explored. \n\n- Chapter 5 summarizes the Conclusions, and the main achievements of this thesis. It also \n\nhighlights the topics of research that remain open after the work performed during the PhD. In \n\nparticular, it provides preliminary insights on the impacts of blocks/ridges in other relevant \n\nvariables at the European scale (such as drought variability and wildfire occurrence). A brief \n\noutlook at future changes in blocking/ridge occurrence is also presented in this section.  \n\nIn Annex, two additional studies which were published during the course of this PhD are \n\npresented (Sousa et al., 2015; Trigo et al., 2013b). Although these works are not directly \n\nconnected with the main motivation of this PhD, their datasets and part of the addressed topics \n\nare discussed throughout this thesis. \n\n \n\n\n\n2.

European temperature responses to blocking \n \n \n\n32 \n \n\nSummary \n \n\n \n\nContext and objectives \n\nThis chapter is devoted to the characterization of the seasonal impacts of blocks and ridges on \n\nEuropean temperature at continental and regional scales by using the E-OBS dataset, as \n\ndescribed in Sousa et al. (2017b). Section 2.1.2 provides a novel approach to disentangle high-\n\nlatitude blocks from sub-tropical ridges. Geopotential height (Z500) from the NCEP/NCAR \n\ndataset is used to develop a catalogue of sub-tropical ridges, which will be employed throughout \n\nthe remaining of this thesis. As an important novelty, the temperature impacts of blocking and \n\nridges are disentangled by considering three different sectors of occurrence (ATL, EUR and \n\nRUS) within the Euro-Atlantic region. Special attention is paid to explore extreme temperature \n\nevents and the driving mechanisms of the temperature responses associated to each considered \n\natmospheric pattern. \n\n \n\nMethods \n\nAn algorithm based on exceedances of Z500 thresholds (against the daily climatology) in three \n\nlongitudinal consecutive sectors (ATL, EUR and RUS) was developed to detect ridges, avoiding \n\ntheir overlap with blocking occurrence. These two catalogues are used to compute composites \n\nof minimum and maximum temperatures for each regime and sector. An analysis of the \n\ntendency equation was performed, detecting the main contributing term to the regional \n\ntemperature anomalies induced by each weather regime. This was supported by a surface \n\nradiative budget decomposition. Finally, changes in regional extreme temperature occurrences \n\nwere examined. \n\n \n\n \n\nResults \n\nThere are substantial differences in the European 2 m temperature responses to blocking and \n\nridge regimes, particularly during winter. While winter blocking (essentially in the ATL and \n\nEUR sectors) leads to generalized below average temperatures and cold spells, prompted by \n\ncold advection from northerly flows, mild winter days occur during ridge regimes, with \n\nincreases up to 7\u00baC in parts of central Europe, through enhanced transport from Atlantic air \n\nmasses and reduced long-wave cooling.  \n\nDuring summer, both atmospheric patterns are associated with warmer temperatures in central \n\nand northern Europe. However, in southernmost countries, and in particular in the \n\nMediterranean area, only ridges (mainly those occurring in the EUR sector) exert a large \n\ninfluence on the occurrence of hot summer days. During this season, and for both weather \n\nregimes, the anomalous radiative heating due to enhanced clear sky conditions plays a leading \n\nrole in explaining the positive temperature anomalies over continental areas. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n2. European temperature responses to blocking \n \n \n\n33 \n \n\n2.1 Paper in Climate Dynamics \n\n \n\nPedro M. Sousa, Ricardo M. Trigo, David Barriopedro, Pedro M. M. Soares, Jo\u00e3o A. Santos \n\nPaper published in Climate Dynamics (2017b) \n\n \n\nBlocking occurrence and its impacts on European temperature have been studied in the last \n\ndecade. However, most previous studies on blocking impacts have focused on winter only, \n\ndisregarding its fingerprint in summer and differences with other synoptic patterns that also trigger \n\ntemperature extremes. In this work, we provide a clear distinction between high-latitude blocking \n\nand sub-tropical ridges occurring in three sectors of the Euro-Atlantic region, describing their \n\nclimatology and consequent impacts on European temperature during both winter and summer.  \n\nWinter blocks (ridges) are generally associated to colder (warmer) than average conditions over \n\nlarge regions of Europe, in some areas with anomalies larger than 5\u00baC, particularly for the patterns \n\noccurring in the Atlantic and Central European sectors. During summer, there is a more regional \n\nresponse characterized by above average temperature for both blocking and ridge patterns, \n\nespecially those occurring in continental areas, although negative temperature anomalies persist in \n\nsouthernmost areas during blocking.  \n\nAn objective analysis of the different forcing mechanisms associated to each considered weather \n\nregime has been performed, quantifying the importance of the following processes in causing the \n\ntemperature anomalies: horizontal advection, vertical advection and diabatic heating. While during \n\nwinter advection processes tend to be more relevant to explain temperature responses, in summer \n\nradiative heating under enhanced insolation plays a crucial role for both blocking and ridges.  \n\nFinally, the changes in the distributions of seasonal temperature and in the frequencies of \n\nextreme temperature indices were also examined for specific areas of Europe. Winter blocking and \n\nridge patterns are key drivers in the occurrence of regional cold and warm extreme temperature, \n\nrespectively. In summer, they are associated with substantial changes in the frequency of extremely \n\nwarm days, but with different signatures in southern Europe. We conclude that there has been \n\nsome misusage of the traditional blocking definition in the attribution of extreme events. \n\n2.1.1 Introduction \n\nAnomalous temperature episodes are one of the most widely addressed topics in climatological \n\nstudies, and numerous works have been published in the last decades concerning this subject in \n\nEurope, at both continental and regional scales. They cover a wide range of sub-topics, ranging \n\nfrom winter cold spells to summer heatwaves (e.g. Santos et al., 2006; Cattiaux et al., 2010; \n\nAndrade et al., 2012; Simolo et al., 2012; Monteiro et al., 2013; Lowe et al., 2015), heatwave-\n\nrelated mortality (Garc\u00eda-Herrera et al., 2005b; Trigo et al., 2009; Muthers et al., 2010; Green et \n\nal., 2016), forest fires (Pereira et al., 2005; Marcos et al., 2015; Sousa et al., 2015), drought \n\noccurrence and agricultural management (Bastos et al., 2014; Gouveia et al., 2016), amongst other \n\ntopics. The physical and dynamical mechanisms that trigger such extreme episodes are interpreted \n\n\n\n2. European temperature responses to blocking \n \n \n\n34 \n \n\nwith very distinct methodologies. In this sense, an increasing number of studies are focusing on \n\nthe contribution from large-scale dynamics and mid-latitude synoptic circulation patterns to the \n\noccurrence of these anomalously cold/warm temperature episodes (e.g. Andrade et al., 2012; \n\nCattiaux et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013; Pfahl, 2014). \n\nIn the context of climatic change, trends in global mean temperature have been accompanied by \n\nan increase of warm extreme temperature events (Fischer and Knutti 2015), which has not been \n\noffset by the hiatus or slowdown in global mean temperature rise of the last 15 years (Seneviratne \n\net al. 2014). These recent trends do not only indicate a thermodynamic forcing, but also changes \n\nin the frequency of occurrence of mid-latitude circulation patterns (Horton et al., 2015), thus \n\nstressing the need of characterizing their associated impacts. \n\nRegarding European winter cold spells, there is a wide consensus on the critical role played by \n\natmospheric blocking episodes over large sectors of the European continent. In works such as \n\nTrigo et al. (2004), Cattiaux et al. (2010), Sillmann et al. (2011), de Vries et al. (2012) or Pfahl \n\n(2014), the role of blocking structures in transporting cold air from higher latitudes or from cold \n\nlandmasses becomes quite clear. Other studies have undertaken a deeper analysis of some specific \n\nEuropean winter cold spells, as well as of their associated synoptic context, and have also \n\naddressed feedback processes that may amplify the resulting anomalies, such as Eurasian autumn \n\nsnow-cover anomalies (Garc\u00eda-Herrera and Barriopedro, 2006; Cohen and Jones, 2011). The \n\ninterplay between Rossby wave-breaking and jet stream regimes (Woolings et al., 2011), or the \n\noccurrence of Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (Barriopedro and Calvo, 2014; Liu et al., 2014), \n\nare potential mediators of blocking activity, and hence, important precursors of cold events. \n\nEpisodes like the extensive cold spell which occurred on the later stages of the previously mild \n\nwinter of 2012 (WMO, 2012) are pertinent examples of the relevance of complex feedback \n\nprocesses in triggering significant European cold blasts.  \n\nBlocking has also been associated with extremely warm episodes in summer (Buehler et al., \n\n2011; Andrade et al., 2012; Pfahl, 2014). However, using the well-known 2003 heatwave in \n\nEurope as an example, Garc\u00eda-Herrera et al. (2010) stressed that there is some overstatement when \n\nattributing these episodes to standard definitions of atmospheric blocking \u2013 high-latitude quasi-\n\nstationary anticyclones associated with a reversal of the prevailing westerly flow (e.g., Rex, \n\n1950a,b; Treidl et al., 1981; Barriopedro et al., 2006, 2010a). These weather systems are indeed in \n\nclear association with summer heat episodes over European mid/high-latitudes (e.g. Barriopedro \n\net al., 2011; Pfahl, 2014). However, this is not the case for southern European sectors, where high-\n\nlatitude blocks are frequently associated with colder than average temperatures throughout the \n\nyear. Therefore, there is a clear need to distinguish high-latitude blocking structures from low-\n\nlatitude systems, including the extensions of sub-tropical high pressure systems, commonly \n\ndenominated as sub-tropical ridges. Unlike canonical blocking systems, sub-tropical ridges do not \n\nhave the necessary condition of a wave-breaking occurrence (Woollings et al., 2011; Masato et al., \n\n2011; Santos et al., 2013). They manifest as relatively narrow bands of positive anomalies of \n\ngeopotential height extending from sub-tropical latitudes towards southern Europe and often \n\nreaching higher latitudes. Although sub-tropical ridges can be precursors of wave-breaking and \n\n\n\n2. European temperature responses to blocking \n \n \n\n35 \n \n\nsubsequent blocking (Altenhoff et al., 2008; Masato et al., 2011; Davini et al., 2012a), their impacts \n\non European surface temperatures are rather different from those of high-latitude blocks. \n\nGarc\u00eda-Herrera et al. (2005b) briefly introduced the importance of sub-tropical ridging patterns \n\non extreme summer temperatures over Iberia. Other studies have analyzed ridge patterns over \n\nEurope and their influence on rainfall regimes and droughts in southwestern Europe (Santos et al., \n\n2009; Santos et al., 2013). However, there are no systematic studies aiming to characterize and \n\ndistinguish the impacts on European temperature due to blocking and ridge patterns, at both \n\nregional and seasonal scales. In this paper, we characterize the local and regional European \n\ntemperature responses associated with blocking and ridging patterns occurring over different \n\nlocations of the Euro-Atlantic sector and on different seasons. We also clarify some of the referred \n\nambiguity on the impacts\u2019 attribution to these weather systems. More specifically, the main \n\nobjectives are to: 1) distinguish blocking and ridge structures with objective detection schemes; 2) \n\ncharacterize the seasonal  impacts of these patterns, considering their specific location, on \n\nEuropean surface temperature (including extremes); 3) objectively quantify the contribution and \n\nseasonality of the main physical mechanisms involved in the regional temperature anomalies \n\nassociated to blocking and ridging regimes. \n\n \n\n2.1.2 Data and Methods \n\nMeteorological Data \n\nMaximum and minimum near-surface temperatures (at 2 m above the ground, T2m hereafter) \n\nare considered for the period spanning between 1950 and 2012 from the E-OBS dataset (Haylock \n\net al., 2008). This high-resolution gridded dataset is provided by the European Climate Assessment \n\nand Dataset (ECA&amp;D) project, and is available on a daily basis and on a horizontal resolution of \n\n0.25\u00ba latitude \u00d7 0.25\u00ba longitude. This regular grid is obtained by interpolating observations from \n\nlocal meteorological stations. Despite the overall good quality of this dataset, it must be \n\nacknowledged that it has some caveats in areas where the spatial distribution of stations is sparser \n\n(e.g., Kysel\u00fd and Plavcov\u00e1 2010). Moreover, the E-OBS temperature dataset suffers from other \n\nlimitations such as inhomogeneities in input records, statistical interpolation errors and \u201cheat \n\nisland\u201d effects (Hofstra et al. 2009; van der Schrier et al. 2013). \n\nThe NCEP/NCAR reanalysis daily dataset is also used (Kalnay et al., 1996), at a 2.5\u00ba latitude \u00d7 \n\n2.5\u00ba longitude horizontal resolution for the same period. The following mean daily fields are \n\nselected: 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500); 850 hPa temperature, omega-vertical velocity and \n\nhorizontal wind components; upward, downward and net long-wave and short-wave surface \n\nfluxes; and total cloud cover. The Z500 field was used to compute the blocking (Barriopedro et \n\nal., 2006) and ridge days catalogues separately, as described below. These two different dynamical \n\nindicators will be used to distinguish the impacts of anomalous geopotential fields at different \n\nEuropean sectors (see next section). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n2. European temperature responses to blocking \n \n \n\n36 \n \n\nBlocking and Ridge Catalogues \n\nThe catalogue of days adopted in this work for high-latitude blocking (hereafter only referred as \n\nblocking) was developed by Barriopedro et al. (2006). The algorithm is an adapted version of the \n\nTibaldi and Molteni (1990) index based on the reversal of the meridional Z500 gradient around \n\nthe typical latitudes of the extra-tropical jet stream. It further imposes spatial (minimum \n\nlongitudinal extension of 12.5\u00ba) and temporal (minimum duration of 5 days) criteria to account for \n\nthe characteristic spatio-temporal scales of blocking. The algorithm also enables the \n\ncharacterization of useful daily parameters, such as the location of the blocking center, the intensity \n\nor the spatial extension. Following previous studies (Sousa et al., 2016, 2017), where the same \n\ncatalogue was used to assess the impacts of blocking patterns on precipitation regimes over \n\nEurope, three non-overlapping blocking sectors covering the Europe and the eastern Atlantic are \n\ndefined. More specifically, daily blocking occurrences are assigned to one of the following spatial \n\nsectors according to the location of their blocking centers (Fig. 2.1): ATL (30\u00baW\u20130\u00ba), EUR (0\u00ba\u2013\n\n30\u00baE) and RUS (30\u00baE\u201360\u00baE). \n\n \n\nFig. 2.1 Geographical representation of the considered sectors for blocking location (thick black \n\nframes): Atlantic (ATL) \u2013 from 30\u00baW to 0\u00ba; European (EUR) \u2013 from 0\u00ba to 30\u00baE; Russian (RUS) \u2013 from \n\n30\u00baE to 60\u00baE. Each of these sectors was also sub-divided into two smaller 15\u00ba longitude-wide sub-\n\nsectors (west and east, dashed black lines). Magenta boxes identify areas for regional-scale \n\nassessments (cf. Section 2.1.3). \n\n \n\nTo compute the catalogue of sub-tropical ridge days (hereafter only referred to as ridges), we \n\nfollow a similar methodology as in Santos et al. (2009), which is based on daily anomalies of the \n\nZ500 field. In order to compare it with the blocking catalogue, we also classified ridge occurrence \n\ninto the same three sectors (ATL, EUR and RUS). Furthermore, each sector is split into two halves: \n\nsouth (30\u00baN\u201350\u00baN) and north (50\u00baN\u201370\u00baN). These latitudinal bands are used for winter and, to \n\naccommodate the annual cycle, they are shifted 5\u00ba northward for summer. This partition enables \n\nclassifying ridges as strong Z500 positive departures in sub-tropical and mid-latitudes that do not \n\n\n\n2. European temperature responses to blocking \n \n \n\n37 \n \n\nextend significantly northwards, thus avoiding overlapping days between blocking and ridge \n\npatterns. For each grid point, we computed Z500 departures for each specific day, and a 30-day \n\nrunning threshold based on the 80th percentile of the daily Z500 series. We then obtained, on a \n\ndaily basis and for each longitudinal sector, the percentage of area above that threshold in its \n\nnorthern and southern halves. To classify a ridge day in one of the three considered longitudinal \n\nsectors the following criteria are employed: 1) at least 75% of the area in the southern half is above \n\nthe threshold; 2) less than 50% of the area in the northern half is above the same threshold. These \n\npercentages and thresholds were tested and calibrated in order to avoid overlaps between blocking \n\nand ridge dates, and furthermore to obtain climatological ridge frequencies comparable to previous \n\nstudies (e.g. Santos et al. 2009).  \n\nWe also evaluate for each blocking and ridge day the contribution to grid point temperature \n\nanomalies of three major physical forcings: horizontal advection, vertical advection and diabatic \n\nprocesses. This is carried out by separating and identifying the process associated with the largest \n\ndaily temperature change at each grid point (considering only those cells where the absolute \n\ntemperature anomalies exceed 1\u00baC under the given weather regime). Daily mean horizontal and \n\nvertical temperature advections are explicitly calculated as in Equations (1) and (2), respectively: \n\n(\n??\n\n??\n)\n\n?\n(?, ?, ?) = ???? ? ???   (1) \n\n \n\n(\n??\n\n??\n)\n\n?\n(?, ?, ?) = ??\n\n?\n\n?\n \n??\n\n??\n         (2) \n\n \n\nwhere the term (\n??\n\n??\n)\n\n?\n is the temperature advection by the horizontal wind, and (\n\n??\n\n??\n)\n\n?\n the \n\ntemperature advection by vertical motion. Equations (1) and (2) are computed from daily mean \n\nfields in constant pressure coordinates, according to the pressure levels available in the \n\nNCEP/NCAR dataset, with (?,?,t) representing latitude, longitude and time, respectively, and v \n\nbeing the horizontal wind, T the temperature, ? the vertical velocity and ? the potential \n\ntemperature. The daily mean temperature rate due to diabatic processes, (\n??\n\n??\n)\n\n?\n, is estimated as a \n\nresidual from the previous two terms based on the temperature tendency equation: \n\n(\n??\n\n??\n)\n\n?\n(?, ?, ?) =\n\n??\n\n??\n? (\n\n??\n\n??\n)\n\n?\n? (\n\n??\n\n??\n)\n\n?\n (3) \n\n \n\nwhere \n??\n\n??\n is the daily mean temperature tendency (in K day-1). The residual approximation for the \n\ndiabatic term has been previously applied to reanalyses datasets in Chan and Nigam (2009) or \n\nWright and Fueglistaler (2013). It must be kept in mind that different factors such as sub-grid \n\nturbulent mixing, analysis increments and other numerical errors may contribute to the residual \n\nterm. Further, this approach does not consider sub-daily fluctuations of the contributing terms, \n\npotential interactions among the underlying processes and feedbacks between the dynamics and \n\nthermodynamics. For example, in addition to horizontal warm advection, diabatic and adiabatic \n\n\n\n2. European temperature responses to blocking \n \n \n\n38 \n \n\nheating experienced during the re-circulation of air masses around high pressure systems can \n\ncontribute to the warm anomalies. Similarly, warm temperatures induced by a given weather \n\nsystem can in turn modulate the contributing terms by reinforcing the Z500 anomaly. Thus, the \n\nattribution of the temperature responses should be taken with caution, as some one-directional \n\ncausal relationships cannot be fully inferred from a composite analysis.  \n\nThis bulk analysis is performed for the 1000-850 hPa layer. Then, we compute the daily \n\nanomalies of all terms in Equation (3) and the relative contribution of each term (\n??\n\n??\n)\n\n?\n\n?\n\n (in %) to \n\nthe total change (\n??\n\n??\n)\n\n?\n, where primes denote daily anomalies. Finally, we derive the composited \n\nvalues of (\n??\n\n??\n)\n\n?\n\n?\n\n for blocking and ridge days, and the leading process i with the largest contribution \n\nto the temperature tendency anomaly.  \n\nIn this work, the analyses are performed for winter and summer separately, using the \n\nmeteorological seasons: December to February and June to August, respectively. The statistical \n\nsignificance of the anomalies presented in the Results section was assessed with a two-sample \n\nKolmogorov-Smirnov test (the 5% significance level was considered). \n\n \n\n2.1.3 Results \n\n2.1.3.1 Blocking and ridge seasonal distribution \n\nThe classification of events according to their position enables a simple and objective way of \n\ngrouping blocking and ridge days in each sector and season. It also allows the computation of \n\ncomposites for the aforementioned meteorological variables under each specific synoptic pattern. \n\nThe winter and summer composites of Z500 anomalies for blocking and ridge days of each sector \n\nare shown in Fig. 2.2. Overall, blocking and ridges display a clear difference in the latitude of their \n\nmaximum Z500 anomalies. The composites for blocking days show an omega-like structure, \n\nwhich is distinguishable from the non-wave-breaking pattern that is evident in the composites \n\ncorresponding to days of ridge. Furthermore, the absolute anomalies are larger in winter, and for \n\nblocking regimes (Fig. 2.2a-c). During winter, around one third of the days comprises blocking \n\noccurrence in at least one sector of the Euro-Atlantic region, while summer frequencies are smaller, \n\nparticularly over the ATL sector (Fig. 2.2g). The composites accurately capture the signatures \n\nassociated with blocking over preferred sectors of occurrence in the Eurasian sector (Barriopedro \n\net al. 2006). It is still worth noting that some events contribute to the composites of more than one \n\nsector during their lifecycle (Sousa et al., 2017a). Ridge frequencies are more equally distributed \n\nthroughout the three sectors and seasons, with closer values to those of blocking during summer. \n\nThe largest Z500 anomalies under ridging patterns are found for ATL and EUR ridges in winter \n\n(Fig. 2.2d-e). The positive anomalies of Z500 during blocking and ridge regimes are often \n\naccompanied by negative anomalies, but much less pronounced. The most relevant negative Z500 \n\nanomalies occur southwards (northwards) of the blocking (ridges) centers, mainly for ATL \n\nstructures in winter (Fig. 2.2a and 2.2d). \n\n\n\n2.

All values are in gpm and \n\nthe thick line represents the 5500 isohypse (the thinner contours are separated by 50 gpm). The \n\nseasonal frequencies of occurrence for each regime are shown in percentage. \n\nIn the following sub-sections, the specific surface temperature responses driven by each weather \n\nregime, as well as the corresponding synoptic environments, will be analyzed in more detail. \n\n \n\n2.1.3.2 Seasonal temperature responses \n\nUsing the seasonal and regional catalogues of blocking and ridge days, we computed the \n\ncorresponding composites for the maximum and minimum T2m anomalies. In Figs. 2.3 and 2.4 \n\nwe present the maximum (TX) and minimum (TN) temperature anomalies for winter and summer, \n\ndisplaying only statistically significant anomalies at the 5% significance level.  \n\n\n\n2. European temperature responses to blocking \n \n \n\n40 \n \n\nOverall, the geographical locations of the anomaly patterns undergo west-east shifts, in \n\nagreement with the positioning of the considered blocking or ridge structure (as presented in Fig. \n\n2.2). Additionally, there is a clear seasonality in the responses to blocking and ridge patterns, as \n\nthey typically extend over larger areas in winter than in summer. Furthermore, the temperature \n\nresponses to blocking are opposite to those of ridges in winter, but not in summer. These distinctive \n\nsignatures highlight the need of distinguishing between blocking and ridges, including their spatial \n\nscales and location. \n\n \n\nFig. 2.3 Composites for blocking and ridge days occurring in each sector (ATL, EUR and RUS) of \n\nwinter 2 meters above ground maximum (upper panels \u2013 TX; a-c and d-f, respectively) and minimum \n\ntemperature (lower panels \u2013 TN; g-i and j-l, respectively) anomalies (in \u00baC). Only statistically \n\nsignificant anomalies at 5% significance level are depicted. \n\n\n\n2. European temperature responses to blocking \n \n \n\n41 \n \n\n \n\nThe responses in TN and TX are generally coherent for all sectors and regimes during winter \n\n(Fig. 2.3) and reveal highly contrasting patterns between blocking and ridges (Fig. 2.3a-c versus \n\n2.3d-f). While during blocking most of Europe experiences well below average temperatures, ridge \n\ndays are characterized by extensive above average temperatures. Negative anomalies exceeding -\n\n3\u00baC tend to occur southward and eastward of the blocking centers, with ATL blocking (Fig. 2.3a) \n\nrevealing the largest widespread signal over the continent. During blocking episodes, strong \n\npositive temperature anomalies are found in land areas under the highest Z500 anomalies (Fig. \n\n2.2), i.e. northern half of Scandinavia for EUR blocks (Fig. 2.3b) and northern Russia and eastern \n\nScandinavia for RUS blocks (Fig. 2.3c). Conversely, winter ridges in both ATL and EUR sectors \n\n(Fig. 2.3d-e) are responsible for anomalously warm conditions in almost all regions of Europe. \n\nThese anomalies are particularly striking for EUR ridges (Fig. 2.3d), when Central Europe \n\nexperiences positive TX anomalies reaching up to 7\u00baC. There are some areas on the ridge\u2019s eastern \n\nand western flanks that experience slightly below average temperatures, mainly in Mediterranean \n\nregions. This is particularly noteworthy in Turkey during EUR ridges (Fig. 2.3k), though these \n\nnegative anomalies are smaller in magnitude and spatial extension than their positive counterparts. \n\n \n\nAs previously mentioned, summer temperature anomalies (Fig. 2.4) are more spatially confined \n\nthan in winter and the opposite temperature response to blocking and ridge patterns is no longer \n\nobserved (Fig. 2.3). In the case of blocking systems, positive anomalies are again centered under \n\nthe maximum Z500 anomaly area, but now affecting larger areas. In particular, during EUR (RUS) \n\nblocking, extensive areas of Central Europe and Scandinavia (Eastern Europe and Russia) \n\nexperience anomalously warm conditions, with TX anomalies >5\u00baC, as seen in Fig. 2.4b (2.4c). \n\nTemperature anomalies for ATL blocking (Fig. 2.4a) are much less pronounced. As in winter, \n\nnegative anomalies are found in the southern and eastern flanks of blocking systems, but they are \n\nsmall in magnitude, and mostly restricted to TX. Still, southern areas of Europe (e.g., Iberia, \n\nBalkans) display negative temperature anomalies associated to blocking in both winter and \n\nsummer. \n\nSummer ridges are associated with above normal temperatures over a more confined area than \n\nin winter. In particular, they do not have significant effects in temperature over northernmost areas \n\nof Europe during this season. The lack of opposite signed responses to blocking and ridges during \n\nsummer is evident in some regions, such as Central Europe or Russia, which experience above \n\naverage surface temperatures under both regimes, albeit at different latitudes. On the contrary, in \n\nsouthernmost areas, particularly the Iberian Peninsula for ATL regimes (Fig 2.4d and 2.4a), \n\npositive temperature anomalies during ridge days tend to be replaced by negative anomalies during \n\nblocking days. Furthermore, summer temperature anomalies over southern Europe critically \n\ndepend on the specific location of ridge structures. \n\n\n\n2. European temperature responses to blocking \n \n \n\n42 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 2.4 Same as in Fig. 2.3, but for summer. \n\n  \n\nAlthough their locations are similar, TX anomalies (Fig. 2.4d-f) are larger in magnitude than \n\nthose of TN (Fig. 2.4j-l). This different amplitude in the day-time and night-time temperature \n\nresponses is much more pronounced than during winter, which is also observed for blocking \n\nsystems (Fig. 2.4a-c vs 2.4g-i). This is particularly relevant for the occurrence of extremely hot \n\ndays in summer. In this sense, it is worth noticing that a given synoptic pattern can affect very \n\ndifferently areas situated relatively close, as shown by Garc\u00eda-Herrera et al. (2005b) when \n\ncomparing the weather regimes associated with local heatwaves in Lisbon and Madrid. Therefore, \n\na finer-scale analysis using smaller regional sectors is required to address local extreme events. In \n\n\n\n2. European temperature responses to blocking \n \n \n\n43 \n \n\nFigs. 2.12 and 2.13 of the Supplementary Material we show the winter and summer composites of \n\nTX and TN, considering narrower longitudinal sub-sectors for blocking and ridge location (15\u00ba \n\nlongitude-wide). Overall, the results are similar to those of Fig. 2.3 and 2.4, although the \n\ntemperature responses to summertime ridges are more spatially restricted, especially in western \n\nEurope. As an illustration for the Iberian Peninsula, the exact areas under intense summer hot \n\nconditions are very dependent on small west-east shifts in the position of the sub-tropical ridge \n\n(Fig. 2.14g-i). Thus, some regional impacts can be smoothed out in the analysis using larger \n\nsectors. However, on the whole, the analysis based on three 30\u00ba longitudinal sectors is sufficient \n\nto identify the most relevant temperature responses to blocking and ridges, as well as the associated \n\nmechanisms, which are described in the following section. \n\n \n\n2.1.3.3 Synoptic and forcing mechanisms \n\nIn this section we apply the methodology described in Section 2 in order to assess the relative \n\ncontribution of different processes to the local temperature anomalies associated with blocks and \n\nridges, namely: 1) horizontal advection by the large-scale flow; 2) vertical advection - adiabatic \n\nheating/cooling; 3) diabatic processes. In most cases one dominant mechanism can be identified, \n\nthough local temperature responses can also be due to a combination of the forcing terms, \n\nfrequently involving a partial cancelation in the net temperature tendency. For the sake of \n\nsuccinctness, only the leading term is shown in Fig. 5, and the full analysis of the heating/cooling \n\nfraction due to each specific term is presented in the Supplementary Material (Figs. 2.14 and 2.15). \n\n \n\nDuring winter (Fig. 2.5a-c) and summer (Fig. 2.5g-i) blocking days, horizontal advection by \n\nanomalous southerly flows appears responsible for a large fraction of the warming observed in the \n\nnorthwestern flank of the blocking systems, with the exception of winter RUS blocks. The negative \n\ntemperature anomalies found in the southeastern flank of the blocking center, particularly striking \n\nduring winter, are also predominantly a result of cold advection from higher latitudes under the \n\nnortherly flow established along the eastern flank of the high-pressure system (see the anomalous \n\nwind fields in Fig. 2.5a-c). This colder air is carried towards southern Europe (e.g. north of the \n\nBlack Sea), thus interacting with different air masses. As a result, other processes, such as diabatic \n\ncooling, and in particular, convective processes in warm seasons, can gain further importance in \n\nlocalized areas to the southeast of the blocking centers (Sousa et al. 2017a). This mixed \n\ncontribution of different forcing terms at lower latitudes under blocking occurrence is confirmed \n\nby Fig. 2.14 and 2.15. In areas under the maximum geopotential height anomaly, warming due to \n\nreinforced subsidence and diabatic heating gains particular relevance, particularly for continental \n\nblocks. There are also differences in the relative contribution of each term depending on the season \n\n(Fig.2.5a-c and 2.5g-i):  warming due to horizontal advection is relevant during both winter and \n\nsummer blocks, while anomalous downward motion is mostly relevant for winter blocking. On the \n\nother hand, significant diabatic heating dominates in summer, predominantly over continental \n\nareas (Fig. 2.5h-i). As shown later, the summer dominance of the diabatic term over land areas is \n\nwell explained by changes in the radiative flux budgets. \n\n\n\n2. European temperature responses to blocking \n \n \n\n44 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 2.5 Mechanisms related to temperature anomalies in the lower troposphere (1000\u2013850 hPa) \n\nduring blocking and ridge days during winter (upper panels, a-c and d-f, respectively) and summer \n\n(lower panels, g-i and j-l, respectively). Color shadings depict anomalies in the mean daily \n\ntemperature (in \u00baC). Solid (dashed) contours represent positive (negative) 500 hPa geopotential height \n\nanomalies in 15 dam intervals. Light grey vectors show anomalies in the horizontal wind direction. \n\nSymbols denote the highest contributing mechanism for the observed temperature changes at each grid \n\npoint: horizontal advection (?), vertical advection (?) and diabatic processes (X). \n\n \n\nRegarding ridge days, warm horizontal advection from Atlantic air masses influences the \n\ntemperature responses in the northern flank of the ridge, particularly during winter ATL and EUR \n\nridges (Fig. 2.5d-e). This is associated with the passage of cyclones, but also with the \n\ncorresponding changes in cloud cover and long-wave fluxes, as explained below.  Similarly to \n\nblocking, subsidence and diabatic processes are crucial in continental areas under the influence of \n\nwinter and summer sub-tropical ridges (Fig. 2.14m-r and 2.15m-r). Adiabatic heating due to strong \n\nsubsidence extends over larger areas in winter than in summer, mostly eastwards of the maximum \n\n\n\n2. European temperature responses to blocking \n \n \n\n45 \n \n\nZ500 anomalies (Fig. 2.5e-f), while diabatic heating dominates the summer temperature responses \n\n(Fig. 2.5k-l). Over the Iberian Peninsula, subsidence and horizontal advection towards \n\nsouthwestern coasts are the main driver for above average summer temperatures during ATL \n\nridges. \n\nIt should be stressed that NCEP/NCAR temperature anomalies for the considered layer do not \n\nfully overlap with the TX and TN anomalies of the E-OBS datasets in all areas and for all regimes, \n\nthus partially explaining some discrepancies between the areas highlighted in Fig. 2.5 and Figs. \n\n2.3 and 2.4. Still, there are also some important dynamical features related to these discrepancies. \n\nFor example, negative T2m anomalies during winter blocking (Fig. 2.3a-c, 2.3g-i) are more \n\nwidespread than aloft (Fig. 2.5a-c). In particular, some areas with negative near-surface \n\ntemperature anomalies display simultaneously positive anomalies in the highest level of the \n\nconsidered layer (850 hPa, not shown). This indicates a typical pattern of thermal inversion under \n\nhigh pressure systems, which extends westwards of the blocking center (see Fig. 2.16a-c). The \n\nthermal inversion and the corresponding imprisonment of cold air at lower levels are typical of \n\nenhanced long-wave radiative cooling, thus stressing the importance of diabatic processes for the \n\nnear-surface temperature responses. During summer, the well-mixed boundary layer determines a \n\nbetter agreement between anomalies at surface and aloft, supporting the smaller role of horizontal \n\nadvection when compared to other processes, particularly those associated to diabatic heating. \n\n \n\nUp to now, we have shown that diabatic processes are key to determine the near-surface \n\ntemperature responses to blocking and ridges, particularly in summer. The diabatic term includes \n\ndifferent processes, such as radiative fluxes, latent and sensible heat fluxes and frictional \n\ndissipation. To better frame the observed temperature responses to the weather regimes and the \n\nseasonal-dependent role of the diabatic term, we computed composites of surface radiative fluxes \n\nfor blocking and ridges in winter (Fig. 2.6) and summer (Fig. 2.7), along with composites of total \n\ncloud cover anomalies (Fig. 2.8).  \n\n \n\nThe radiative forcing over Europe during winter blocking episodes is not remarkable, at least \n\nconcerning short-wave fluxes (Fig. 2.6d-f), which are quite modest in high latitudes during months \n\nwith reduced insolation. Anomalies are rather dominated by the gains (losses) in surface net long-\n\nwave fluxes, which in turn are strongly associated with above (below) average cloud cover (see \n\nalso Fig. 2.8a-c). For example, near the blocking centers, the enhanced nocturnal long-wave losses \n\n(Fig. 2.6a-c) under clear sky conditions are partly offset by diurnal short-wave gains (Fig. 2.6d-f). \n\nThis winter radiative surface cooling signal is in agreement with that in the 1000-850 hPa layer \n\ndue to the diabatic term (Fig. 2.14g-i), which is the leading process in areas to the southeast of the \n\nATL and EUR blocking centers (Fig. 2.5a-b). \n\n \n\n\n\n2.

Reddish (bluish) colors \n\ncorrespond to positive (negative) fluxes towards the surface. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n2. European temperature responses to blocking \n \n \n\n47 \n \n\nThe radiative fluxes anomalies during winter ridges reveal an increase in diurnal radiative \n\nheating near the Z500 maximum (Fig. 2.6m-o), due to positive net short-wave fluxes under \n\nenhanced clear sky conditions over Iberia (ATL), Balkans (EUR) and Middle East (RUS). \n\nHowever, this signal is offset by the opposite negative long-wave fluxes (Fig. 2.6j-l) over the same \n\nsouthern regions, as reflected in the total radiative budget (Fig. 2.6p-r). In contrast, areas north of \n\nthe ridge structures exhibit significant increases in cloud cover (Fig. 2.8d-f), which lead to positive \n\nanomalies in the surface long-wave (Fig. 2.6j-l) and total (Fig. 2.6p-r) radiative budgets. A similar \n\nincrease in long-wave and total radiative fluxes is found north of the blocking systems, but \n\nrestricted to very high latitudes (Fig. 2.6a-c, 2.6g-i). The winter radiative heating is particularly \n\nrelevant for the UK and coastal areas of central Europe under ATL or EUR ridges (Fig. 2.6j-k), as \n\nwell as some Mediterranean areas during EUR and RUS ridges (Fig. 2.6k-l). Its combined effect \n\nwith the advection of mild Atlantic air masses explains the large positive near-surface temperature \n\nresponses during ridge days (Fig. 2.3d-f). However, as long-wave radiative fluxes tend to cancel \n\nout the short-wave fluxes, on the overall diabatic processes are less important in the 1000-850 hPa \n\nlayer than subsidence or advection, with the exception made for northern Russia (Fig. 2.5d-f). \n\n  \n\nDuring summer, anomalies in radiative fluxes are larger than in winter, in accordance with the \n\nstronger contribution from diabatic processes (Fig. 2.5g-l) and an increase in insolation hours. Like \n\nin winter, below average cloud cover (Fig. 2.8g-l) over the centers\u2019 systems results in simultaneous \n\nwarming by diurnal radiative gains (Fig. 2.7d-f and Fig. 2.7m-o) and cooling by nocturnal radiative \n\nlosses (Fig. 2.7a-c and Fig. 2.7j-l). Nonetheless, and different to winter, the summer increases in \n\nshort-wave income are stronger in magnitude than the enhanced nocturnal surface long-wave \n\nlosses over areas under the blocking and ridges centers. Thus, short-wave gains clearly dominate \n\nin summer, and the resulting net radiative balance (Fig. 2.7g-i and Fig. 2.7p-r) explains well the \n\nlarger anomalies for TX than for TN. The subsequent increase in daily temperature range can be \n\nfound for both blocking and ridge regimes, being particularly remarkable at higher latitudes for \n\nblocking episodes, and also for central Mediterranean areas during EUR ridges. On the other hand, \n\nareas south of blocking and north of ridges experience losses in net short-wave fluxes and gains in \n\nlong-wave radiation. This is in agreement with increases in cloud cover (Fig. 2.8g-l) due to the \n\ndeflection of humid Atlantic westerly flows around the high pressure centers (e.g., Trigo et al., \n\n2004; Sousa et al. 2017a). This effect on the radiative budget due to increased cloudiness is \n\nparticularly evident for Atlantic areas in summer, when comparing ATL ridges to those located in \n\nEUR or RUS (Fig. 2.7p-r). \n\n \n\n\n\n2.

These regional temperature responses will also be \n\nrelated to the previously discussed forcing mechanisms. The PDF analysis was performed using \n\nall grid point series of each region highlighted in magenta in Fig. 2.1. We computed regional PDFs \n\nfor all days of each season and for each regime separately (Figs. 2.9 and 2.10), along with the \n\ncorresponding changes in mean TN and TX and in their temporal variance. We also measured the \n\ndegree of homogeneity inside each region (?T), by computing the standard deviation of the mean \n\nlocal temperatures of all grid points, thus accounting for the dispersion of the climatological TX \n\nand TN values within each region. As it can be seen in Figs. 2.9 and 2.10 the regions with larger \n\nvalues of ?T comprise important orographic barriers (Iberia, Italy and Turkey). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.9 indicates that wintertime PDF temperature distributions over the considered regions \n\nare generally shifted towards lower values for blocking, and higher values for ridge patterns. \n\nWarming due to the presence of ridge structures is on the overall larger than cooling due to \n\nblocking. The anomalous warming driven by winter ridges may lead to high temperatures over \n\nlarge parts of Europe, such as the Central European region (Figs. 2.9e-f). For this region, EUR \n\nridges (red dashed lines in Fig. 2.9) result in a mean increase in TX of almost 6\u00baC, and of about \n\n4\u00baC in TN, as well as abnormally high frequencies of extremely warm winter days, while nights \n\nwith TN below -10\u00baC are almost nonexistent. In the UK, the frequency of days with TX below \n\nfreezing during ATL (blue dashed lines) and EUR ridge patterns becomes almost negligible (Fig. \n\n2.9b). While ATL and EUR ridges result in well above average temperatures over most of Europe, \n\nthe same is not true for RUS ridges (green dashed lines, Fig. 2.9). In this case, well above average \n\ntemperatures are restricted to the easternmost areas of Europe (cf. Fig. S6a-d for Russia and \n\nTurkey). However, in areas distant enough to the west of such structures (e.g., UK and Iberia) \n\nslightly negative temperature anomalies are found due to the presence of a trough westwards of \n\nthe RUS ridge (Fig. 2.2f).  \n\nDuring winter blocking, there is a shift towards colder TX and TN in all regions, which is \n\nparticularly pronounced for ATL and EUR blocks (blue and red solid lines, Fig. 2.9). Furthermore, \n\nblocking promotes wintertime extreme cold days and nights over large parts of Europe, as inferred \n\nfrom the regional shifts towards the left end tails of the PDF distributions. In particular, ATL \n\nblocks are the main drivers of cold days in all regions, since the location of the high pressure center \n\nfavors cold advection over large areas of the continent (as previously shown in Fig. 2.5a). For the \n\nsame reason, during EUR blocks, colder than average temperatures are observed in Central Europe \n\n(Fig. 2.9e-f) and Italy (Fig. 2.9g-h), extending towards Russia and Turkey (Fig. 2.17a-d). \n\nRemarkable PDF changes during winter RUS blocking are mostly restricted to the easternmost \n\nareas, as it was found for RUS ridges. \n\n \n\n\n\n2.

European temperature responses to blocking \n \n \n\n52 \n \n\nWinter ridges in the ATL and EUR sectors reduce the variance of TX and TN in the UK (Fig. \n\n2.9a-b) by more than 10%, while in Central Europe they are associated with smaller (larger)  \n\nvariability in TX (TN), as shown in Fig. 2.9f (2.9e). On the overall, winter blocking patterns result \n\nin qualitatively similar, but smaller changes in variance. For southern sectors, most weather \n\nregimes concur with larger wintertime variance in TX and TN. This is particularly clear for the \n\nItalian sector (Fig. 2.9g-h), where TX displays around 25% more variability during EUR ridges.  \n\n \n\nDuring summer (Fig. 2.10), the regional PDF responses to blocking and ridges are no longer \n\nopposite in sign for all regions. While ridges (blocks) are still associated with warmer (colder) than \n\naverage temperatures in the southernmost regions (Figs. 2.10c-d and 2.10g-h), both regimes cause \n\nshifts towards higher temperatures in the northernmost regions (Figs. 2.10 a-b and 2.10e-f). Larger \n\nPDF changes are observed for ridges than for blocks, and in TX than in TN, in agreement with \n\nFig. 2.4 and the dominant role of short-wave over long-wave radiative fluxes in summer (Fig. 2.7). \n\nIn the Iberian Peninsula, there is a very clear rise in the number of days with TX above 35\u00baC for \n\nATL and EUR ridges when compared to other regimes (Fig. 2.10d). In Central Europe, EUR \n\nblocking and ridge patterns result in an impressive increase in the frequency of days above 30 and \n\n35\u00baC (Fig. 2.10f), respectively. As we move to eastern Europe, the RUS patterns become more \n\nrelevant (see PDF changes for Russia and Turkey in Fig. 2.17). Concerning summer changes in \n\nvariance, we found a slight increase for almost all patterns and regions, particularly pronounced in \n\nItaly (Fig. 2.10g-h) during EUR ridges.  \n\n\n\n2. European temperature responses to blocking \n \n \n\n53 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 2.10 Same as Fig. 2.9, but for summer. \n\n \n\n Changes in extreme temperatures associated with blocking and ridges were also investigated for \n\neach region of Fig. 2.1. To do so, we computed for each grid point the number of days below the \n\n10th percentile of winter TN (TN10, hereafter) and above the 90th percentile of summer TX \n\n(TX90, hereafter). The percentiles, which were derived from all seasonal days of the period 1950\u2013\n\n2012, the occurrence of exceedances and their changes during blocking and ridges were spatially \n\n\n\n2. European temperature responses to blocking \n \n \n\n54 \n \n\naveraged for all grid points of each region. The relative changes in these extreme indices associated \n\nwith each weather regime are presented in Fig. 2.11 (expressed in % with respect to that expected \n\nfrom the full 1950-2012 climatology). \n\nChanges in TN10 confirm the previously described opposite responses for blocking and ridge \n\npatterns during winter. On the overall, there is an increase in cold winter extremes during blocking \n\n(filled triangle symbols in Fig. 2.11). In particular, the increases in TN10 exceed 10% over Iberia \n\n(Fig. 2.11c) and Central Europe (Fig 2.11b) during ATL blocks. On the other hand, ridges (open \n\ntriangle symbols), especially those occurring in the ATL and EUR sectors, reduce the occurrence \n\nof winter cold extremes in all regions. Similar responses to blocking and ridges are found in winter \n\nTN10 for easternmost areas (cf. Fig. 2.18 for Russia and Turkey), but being the RUS patterns more \n\nrelevant here. \n\nDuring summer, blocking (filled circles) and ridges (open circles) cause opposite changes in the \n\nfrequency of extremely hot days in southern Europe (Iberia and Italy, Fig. 2.11c-d). However, in \n\nareas further north (UK and Central Europe, Fig. 11a-b), both weather regimes promote substantial \n\nincreases in TX90. Thus, while ridging is associated to a rise in the frequency of extremely hot \n\ndays in almost all regions, the same is not true for blocks, which decrease (increase) TX90 in \n\nsouthern (northern) regions. In particular, nearly 30% more extremely hot days occur in Central \n\nEurope and Italy under EUR ridges (Fig. 2.11b and 2.11d, respectively), while in Iberia TX90 \n\nincreases by around 10% during ATL and EUR ridges (Fig. 2.11b). Differently, the most important \n\nregimes for the occurrence of hot days in the UK are ATL and EUR blocks (Fig. 2.11a), which \n\ncause TX90 increases of around 10% and 15%, respectively.  Again, for easternmost areas, weather \n\nregimes centered in the RUS sector trigger the largest changes in TX90. Thus, in Turkey (Fig. \n\n2.18b), extremely hot conditions are driven essentially by RUS ridges, whereas in Russia (Fig. \n\n2.18a) both RUS ridges and blocks result in a 15-20% increase in TX90. In fact, the impact of \n\nanomalous Z500 fields in the Russian area has been widely discussed due to recent events, such \n\nas the 2010 Russian mega-heatwave (e.g., Barriopedro et al. 2011). \n\n \n\n\n\n2.

While winter \n\nblocking characteristics have been extensively studied, our work also focuses on the \n\ncharacterization of blocking impacts on European summer temperature, which has been much less \n\ninvestigated. Furthermore, the extension of this comprehensive analysis towards the sub-tropical \n\nridge phenomenology is a significant novelty. In this sense, this systematical separation between \n\nhigh- and low-latitude structures may be used in other climatological and dynamical applications, \n\nbesides the one presented in this work.  \n\n\n\n2. European temperature responses to blocking \n \n \n\n56 \n \n\nWe introduced an objective separation of the different forcing mechanisms behind the \n\ntemperature responses associated to each considered weather regime. This approach enabled \n\nquantifying the importance of the following forcing factors: horizontal advection, vertical \n\nadvection and diabatic heating. Particular attention was devoted to the radiative contribution to the \n\ndiabatic term. To our knowledge, this systematic quantification of the different contributing factors \n\nto the temperature responses represents an innovation in the literature of climatological impacts \n\nrelated to blocking and ridge phenomenology \u2013 Seo et al. (2016) used a similar approach to link \n\ntemperature anomalies with the Madden-Julian Oscillation. Despite the limitations in the \n\nmethodology, the results are in agreement with previous studies which have analyzed air parcel \n\ntrajectories over Europe and the associated surface temperature responses for some specific case \n\nstudies or regional weather systems. Thus, our approach corroborates these results from another \n\nperspective, and also distinguishes between the physical mechanisms associated with blocking and \n\nridges, and to what extent they critically depend on their exact locations.  \n\nFinally, we complemented our analysis by evaluating changes in the PDF distributions of \n\nseasonal maximum and minimum temperature for different European regions, and in the frequency \n\nof extremely cold nights in winter and hot days in summer. This assessment allowed a finer look \n\nat regional impacts, framing smaller scale responses into the previous larger scale analysis. The \n\nmain results of this study can be summarized as follows: \n\n1) In winter, the synoptic signatures and near-surface temperature responses are generally \n\nopposite between blocking and ridge patterns. In particular, most of Europe experiences colder \n\n(warmer) than average winter conditions during blocking (ridge) days. On the contrary, the \n\nsummer temperature responses to blocking and ridges are more regional and not so dissimilar, with \n\nabove average regional temperatures for both patterns. Negative temperature anomalies are \n\nessentially restricted to southern Europe during blocking episodes. The spring transition in the \n\nblocking signatures from winter cold to summer warm anomalies in central and northern areas of \n\nEurope has been noted recently by Brunner et al (2017). \n\n2) Concerning the regional classification of blocking and ridges, the largest impacts \n\nassociated to the weather regimes of each specific sector follow the specific longitudinal locations \n\nof the maximum 500 hPa geopotential height anomalies. Nevertheless, blocking and ridge \n\nstructures located over central and western Europe are usually the ones with larger and more \n\nextensive temperature anomalies, as they cause the largest disruption of the Atlantic jet stream. \n\n3)   During winter, the horizontal advection by the anomalous flow plays a dominant role in \n\nshaping the lower-tropospheric temperature responses to blocking and ridge systems. In particular, \n\nthe cold advection of high-latitude air masses towards central and southern Europe during blocking \n\nepisodes and the transport of Atlantic moist and warm air towards the continent during sub-tropical \n\nridges are key processes. Over continental areas, long-wave radiative losses associated to blocking \n\nand ridges tend to offset the near-surface temperature anomalies induced by changes in short-wave \n\nradiation fluxes. In summer, diabatic heating is the most important factor in determining warm \n\ntemperature anomalies during blocking and ridge regimes. Different to winter, the induced \n\nanomalies in short-wave radiative fluxes overwhelm those in long-wave radiative fluxes due to the \n\nsummer increase in insolation hours. As a consequence, blocking and ridges prompt larger \n\n\n\n2. European temperature responses to blocking \n \n \n\n57 \n \n\nresponses in maximum than in minimum temperatures, and a resulting increase in the temperature \n\ndaily range. The adiabatic heating triggered by reinforced subsidence during blocking and ridges \n\nplays a secondary role in rising lower-tropospheric temperatures, being more relevant during \n\nwinter, and particularly important near the central locations of the anticyclonic circulation.  \n\n4) This process-oriented attribution has enabled more detailed regional and seasonal analyses, \n\nadditionally reporting some smaller-scale exceptions. However, some limitations must be \n\nacknowledged. For example, although a dominant forcing factor has often been identified, in some \n\ncases there is a similar contribution or a partial cancelation between the considered forcings. In \n\nspite of this, our results are in agreement with Lagrangian-based studies (Pfahl et al., 2015; Bieli \n\net al., 2015; Santos et al., 2015), which have noticed that winter cold events are associated to long \n\nair mass trajectories, whereas summer events are more related to in situ warming due to enhanced \n\nradiation and surface heat fluxes.  \n\n5)  On the overall, winter changes in extremely cold temperatures are spatially coherent, with \n\ngeneralized increases (decreases) in the frequency of TN10 during blocking (ridge) occurrence. \n\nSummer changes in extremely hot days are more regionally focused during blocking and ridge \n\nregimes. This is particularly evident in southern Europe, where we show a clear dissociation \n\nbetween the impacts of blocking (decreases in TX90) and ridges (increases in TX90). Further, the \n\nimpact of ridges is particularly dependent on the exact longitudinal location of northwards \n\nextensions of the sub-tropical ridge belt. \n\nIn summary, we have clarified the very distinct role of blocking and ridges in European \n\ntemperature. This gains particular relevance for summer extreme temperatures in southern Europe, \n\nwhich has been affected by major heatwaves such as the episodes of 2003 and 2007 and is bound \n\nto suffer even more frequent heatwaves in coming decades (Christensen et al., 2013). In this sense, \n\nthere has been some misperception and imprecise attribution of heat episodes in these areas to \n\nclassical blocking definitions (e.g. Trigo et al., 2005). We are confident to have achieved a more \n\ncomplete and consistent phenomenological description of the distinctive impacts of blocking and \n\nridges on European winter and summer temperature. Finally, we must acknowledge the relevance \n\nof performing further sensitivity analyses using different reanalyses datasets when carrying out \n\nspecific methodologies as the one performed in this work, namely the temperature tendency \n\ndiagnostic. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nPedro M.

Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes \n \n \n\n64 \n \n\nSummary \n\n \n\nContext and objectives \n\nIn this chapter the main effects of blocking activity in European precipitation regimes are \n\nanalyzed, as presented in Sousa et al. (2017a). Section 3.1 describes the contrasting signals of \n\nblocked and strong zonal flow regimes. The E-OBS precipitation dataset is used to analyze the \n\nimpacts of blocking/zonal regimes in European precipitation regimes. The regional impacts of \n\nblocking occurrence in different sectors aims a more comprehensive assessment than \n\npreviously performed in the literature. Special attention is devoted to some \n\nsynoptic/dynamical processes and shifts in precipitation regimes associated to each considered \n\natmospheric pattern. Based on the methodology presented in Chapter 2, the separation of \n\nimpacts on European precipitation associated to high- and low-latitude high pressure \n\nstructures (blocks and ridges, respectively) is performed in Section 3.2. The regional impacts \n\nof blocking and ridge occurrence in winter European solid precipitation (snow-cover) are also \n\naddressed (Section 3.3). \n\n \n\nMethods \n\nWe computed composites of daily precipitation and winter snow-cover anomalies occurring \n\nduring blocked and zonal flow days in three longitudinal sectors (ATL, EUR and RUS). To \n\nfurther characterize the synoptic environment, a subset of variables derived from the \n\nNCEP/NCAR dataset was examined: Integrated Vapor Transport (IVT), an instability index \n\n(Lifted Index \u2013 LI) and extratropical cyclone activity. The changes in the Probability Density \n\nFunctions (PDFs) of precipitation distributions in several subcontinental areas over northern \n\nand southern Europe were also computed. \n\n \n\nResults \n\nOur results show a clear north-south dipole in the precipitation regime responses. Blocking \n\noccurrence leads to below average precipitation in the northern half of Europe (more than \n\n50%), due to the ceasing of moist westerly Atlantic flows, and to increased precipitation in \n\nsouthernmost areas, which is in agreement with increased atmospheric instability. A reversal \n\nof these anomalies is found for strong zonal flow days, which are responsible for precipitation \n\ndeficits in southernmost countries of Europe, and precipitation increases further north. Within \n\nstrong zonal flow regimes, we find that subtropical ridges are associated with particularly dry \n\nconditions in the Mediterranean. On the contrary, the analysis of changes in precipitation \n\ndistributions shows a clear shift towards more torrential regimes in the Mediterranean \n\nenvironment during blocking episodes.  \n\nWinter snow-cover is shown to be enhanced during blocking occurrence in large areas of \n\nEurope (including southernmost areas), particularly for ATL patterns, which increase by \n\n~50% the number of days with snow covered surface in central Europe. This impact is related \n\nwith much colder than average conditions under northerly advection. On the other hand, ATL \n\nand EUR ridge regimes impose a much lower frequency of days with snowed soils in large \n\nparts of the continent, due to a predominantly mild zonal flow. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes \n \n \n\n65 \n \n\n3.1 Paper in Climate Dynamics \n\n \n\nPedro M. Sousa, Ricardo M. Trigo, David Barriopedro, Pedro M. M. Soares, Alexandre M. Ramos, \n\nMargarida L. R. Liberato \n\nPaper published in Climate Dynamics (2017a) \n\n \n\nIn this work we performed an analysis on the impacts of blocking episodes on seasonal and \n\nannual European precipitation and the associated physical mechanisms. Distinct domains were \n\nconsidered in detail taking into account different blocking center positions spanning between the \n\nAtlantic and western Russia. Significant positive precipitation anomalies are found for \n\nsouthernmost areas while generalized negative anomalies (up to 75 % in some areas) occur in \n\nlarge areas of central and northern Europe. This dipole of anomalies is reversed when compared \n\nto that observed during episodes of strong zonal flow conditions. We illustrate that the location \n\nof the maximum precipitation anomalies follows quite well the longitudinal positioning of the \n\nblocking centers and discuss regional and seasonal differences in the precipitation responses. To \n\nbetter understand the precipitation anomalies, we explore the blocking influence on cyclonic \n\nactivity. The results indicate a split of the storm-tracks north and south of blocking systems, \n\nleading to an almost complete reduction of cyclonic centers in northern and central Europe and \n\nincreases in southern areas, where cyclone frequency doubles during blocking episodes. \n\nHowever, the underlying processes conductive to the precipitation anomalies are distinct \n\nbetween northern and southern European regions, with a significant role of atmospheric \n\ninstability in southern Europe, and moisture availability as the major driver at higher latitudes. \n\nThis distinctive underlying process is coherent with the characteristic patterns of latent heat \n\nrelease from the ocean associated with blocked and strong zonal flow patterns. We also analyzed \n\nchanges in the full range of the precipitation distribution of several regional sectors during \n\nblocked and zonal days. Results show that precipitation reductions in the areas under direct \n\nblocking influence are driven by a substantial drop in the frequency of moderate rainfall classes. \n\nContrarily, southwards of blocking systems, frequency increases in moderate to extreme rainfall \n\nclasses largely determine the precipitation anomaly in the accumulated totals. In this context, we \n\nshow the close relationship between the more intrinsic torrential nature of Mediterranean \n\nprecipitation regimes and the role of blocking systems in increasing the probability of extreme \n\nevents. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes \n \n \n\n66 \n \n\n3.1.1 Introduction \n\nBlocking systems wield a significant role on the atmospheric dynamics of mid-latitude regions, \n\nand their frequency and variability impinge on the climatology of large continental areas. As a \n\nresult, these high latitude quasi-stationary anticyclones have been frequently studied throughout \n\nthe last decades, regarding their climatology and characterization (e.g., Rex, 1950b, 1951; Treidl \n\net al., 1981; Barriopedro et al., 2006, 2010a; Croci-Maspoli et al., 2007; Davini et al., 2012a), \n\ntheir specific impacts (e.g., Trigo et al., 2004; Sillmann and Croci-Maspoli, 2009; Buehler et al., \n\n2011; Barriopedro et al., 2011; Ruti et al., 2014; Sousa et al., 2016), as well as their \n\nrepresentation in General Circulation Models (Barriopedro et al., 2010a, b, Matsueda et al., \n\n2009; Scaife et al., 2010; Barnes et al., 2012; Vial and Osborn, 2012; Anstey et al., 2013; Dunn-\n\nSigouin and Son, 2013; Masato et al., 2013). Previous studies have found that, over the Euro-\n\nAtlantic sector, the occurrence of winter blocking systems disrupts the dominant zonal \n\ncirculation that affects the European continent, often leading to a reversal of this prevailing \n\nwesterly flux. As a consequence, low-pressure systems travelling from the Atlantic towards \n\nEurope are diverted from their usual paths, resulting in a large decrease of rainfall for most of the \n\nEuropean countries. An exception can be found for southernmost and northernmost sectors of \n\nEurope, which experience increased precipitation due to a bifurcation of the storm-track around \n\nthe blocking high structure (Trigo et al., 2004; Nieto et al., 2007; Sousa et al., 2016). \n\nIt is worth mentioning the differences between a blocking pattern and a subtropical ridge \n\n(Barriopedro et al., 2010a) although sometimes they can induce similar anomalies in surface \n\nclimate variables (Garc\u00eda-Herrera et al., 2010). Some authors have shown that northward \n\nstrengthening\u2019s of sub-tropical ridges in the Eastern Atlantic during the wet season have opposite \n\nprecipitation responses in Western and Southern Europe to those associated with blocking (e.g. \n\nSantos et al., 2009, 2013). Such separation of phenomena should be kept in mind to stress how \n\nimportant is the distinction between the impacts of this type of ridge patterns and those caused by \n\nhigh latitude blocking, which we are concerned about in this particular study. In fact, the balance \n\nbetween strong westerly zonal flows and their interruption at higher (lower) latitudes during \n\nblocking (ridge) episodes tend to dominate a large fraction of the variability of European rainfall \n\n(Hoy et al., 2014). Teleconnection indices associated with major large-scale patterns affecting \n\nthe North-Atlantic and European sectors (particularly the North Atlantic Oscillation, the Eastern \n\nAtlantic and the Scandinavian pattern) are frequently used in order to explain the intra and inter-\n\nannual fluctuations of the intensity of zonal flow, and consequently of precipitation series (e.g. \n\nTrigo et al., 2008; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2009; Altava-Ortiz et al., 2010; Casanueva et al., \n\n2014). Still, such one-dimensional monthly-based approaches hamper a deeper comprehension of \n\nmore complex spatial patterns occurring at intra-monthly time scales, such as blocking systems, \n\nreinforcing the need of using more objective blocking detection schemes. \n\nPrevious studies based on these algorithms have shown that the impacts of Euro-Atlantic \n\nblocks in terms of winter precipitation regimes essentially change with latitude, with a general \n\ndecrease in most of central areas of Europe, and increases at lower and higher latitudes, albeit \n\nover less extensive areas. Such changes may have significant relevance on the annual total \n\nduring years with highly anomalous frequency of blocking occurrence. However, studies of \n\n\n\n3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes \n \n \n\n67 \n \n\nEuropean precipitation changes associated with blocking have been restricted to the winter \n\nseason. In this regard, most of the European continent lacks a comprehensive and all year-round \n\nanalysis on changes in precipitation due to blocking occurrence. This analysis is of particular \n\nrelevance in southern areas of Europe with Mediterranean climates, where precipitation regimes \n\nduring the warm season tend to be more torrential, i.e., with a higher contribution of intense and \n\nmore isolated rainfall episodes to annual totals (e.g. Kutiel et al., 1996; Pe\u00f1arrocha et al., 2002; \n\nBurgueno et al., 2010; Cortesi et al., 2013). Therefore, in this perspective, linking precipitation \n\nanomalies with blocking occurrence throughout the use of objective detection methods acquires \n\nparticular importance. An additional asset of these methods is their versatility to address changes \n\nin surface impacts as a function of the blocking location. In this sense, previous works have \n\nshown that the distinction of separate (yet large) blocking sectors in the Euro-Atlantic sector still \n\nresults in considerably different impacts at finer scales inside the Euro-Atlantic sector (Yao and \n\nLuo, 2014a, b), and even in smaller areas such as the Iberian Peninsula (Sousa et al., 2016). \n\nAccordingly, the relevance of the specific longitudinal position of the center of a blocking \n\nsystem cannot be disregarded when analyzing impacts at such a large scale as for the European \n\ncontinent. \n\nOn the other hand, blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes have been generally \n\ncharacterized throughout the use of composites of either absolute or relative precipitation \n\nanomalies (e.g. Trigo et al., 2004; Masato et al,. 2011). This approach focuses on changes in the \n\nmean and hence, has neglected to a large extent the importance of shifts in precipitation \n\ndistributions which arise from these particular synoptic patterns. Extreme Values theory has been \n\nused to identify either changes in precipitation and temperature extremes over very confined \n\nregions (e.g., Buehler et al., 2011; Sousa et al., 2016) or shifts in temperature distributions \n\n(Sillmann et al., 2011). To the best of our knowledge, the assessment of the impact of blocking \n\npatterns on the entire precipitation distribution has only been addressed outside of Europe in \n\nregions such as California (Hughes et al. 2009). The investigation of these precipitation changes \n\ncan be assessed through rather simple methodologies, like the one used by Soares et al. (2014), \n\nwhich analyzed changes in Probability Density Functions (PDFs) of precipitation series for \n\nPortugal, in the scope of Regional Climate Models performance and future scenarios evaluation. \n\nThis method follows the works of Perkins et al. (2007) and Boberg et al. (2009, 2010). \n\nWorks such as Trigo et al. (2004), Michel et al. (2012), Pfahl (2014) or Sousa et al. (2016) \n\nhave also shown that the precipitation increases found in southern sectors of Europe during \n\nblocking episodes are mainly driven by dynamical features. These factors include synoptic scale \n\nprocesses such as increases in cyclone frequency, but there are also other thermodynamical \n\nfactors which can enhance atmospheric instability at the local or mesoscale (Lolis et al., 2004; \n\nRicard et al., 2012). Hence, smaller scale processes (e.g. latent heat fluxes) must be addressed to \n\nunderstand regional impacts of blocking occurrence, in line with the distinct shaping of \n\nprecipitation Probability Density Functions associated to blocking occurrence in specific sectors \n\nof the European domain. \n\nThe main objective of this work is to characterize the distinct impacts on European \n\nprecipitation regimes of blocking occurrence in three different sectors, taking into account the \n\n\n\n3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes \n \n \n\n68 \n \n\nentire distribution of precipitation series, which allows evaluating the net changes as well as the \n\nresponses in precipitation intensity. The changes in the precipitation regimes of several regions \n\nwill be supported by a comparison between blocked and strong zonal patterns occurring over \n\ndifferent longitudinal sectors of the target domain. Finally, the precipitation responses will be \n\ninterpreted in terms of dynamical and thermodynamical processes. The work is structured as \n\nfollows: in Sect. 3.1.2, the datasets are presented, along with a characterization of typical \n\natmospheric patterns during blocking episodes; in Sect. 3.1.3 the precipitation anomalies \n\nregistered during blocked and zonal patterns are presented, followed by the main dynamical \n\ndrivers associated to these atmospheric patterns in Sect. 3.1.4; the different responses in terms of \n\nchanges in precipitation distributions due to blocked and zonal patterns are presented in Sect. \n\n3.1.5; finally, a summary and discussion of the obtained results is offered in Sect. 3.1.6. \n\n \n\n3.1.2 Data and Methods \n\nWe used daily precipitation data for Europe from the E-OBS dataset during the period 1950\u2013\n\n2012 (Haylock et al. 2008). This European land-only daily high-resolution gridded dataset is \n\naccessible throughout the European Climate Assessment and Dataset (ECA&amp;D), and is available \n\non a grid with a horizontal resolution of 0.25\u00b0 \u00d7 0.25\u00b0, based on the interpolation of daily \n\nobservations from meteorological stations. Despite the overall good quality of this dataset we \n\nmust acknowledge that this dataset has caveats in areas where the spatial distribution of stations \n\nis sparser, such as biased and over smoothed precipitation fields in some cases, as well as \n\npossible effects in extremes (e.g., Hofstra et al. 2009, 2010). \n\nThe dataset from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis (Kalnay et al., 1996), on a horizontal resolution \n\nof 2.5\u00b0 \u00d7 2.5\u00b0 for the 1950\u20132012 period is also used. The variables explicitly considered were: \n\ndaily fields of 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500), Lifted Index (LI) and Latent Heat Flux \n\n(LHF). In addition, several fields also from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis were employed to \n\ncompute the Integrated Water Vapor Transport between 1000 and 300 hPa (IVT, Ramos et al., \n\n2015) and the following catalogues of weather systems: (i) blocking events (Barriopedro et al., \n\n2006); (ii) strong zonal flow days (Sousa et al., 2016); (iii) extratropical cyclones for the \n\nnorthern hemisphere obtained by using the methodology described in Trigo (2006a). These \n\nderived datasets are used to explore the blocking signatures in precipitation regimes and to \n\ninterpret the role of the associated dynamical and thermodynamical processes. \n\nThe particular characteristics of the blocked and zonal days catalogues are described next. We \n\ndistinguish synoptic conditions characterized by blocked patterns and strong zonal flows by \n\nobjectively identifying days under such atmospheric conditions in the Eurasian sector. These \n\nmethods rely on the Z500 field from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis. The catalogue of blocked days \n\nwas developed by Barriopedro et al. (2006) - further information on the methodology can be \n\nfound in that work. The authors have used this and other similar blocking datasets extensively for \n\ndifferent applications, such as to characterize blocking effects on total ozone (Barriopedro et al., \n\n2010c) and stratospheric variability (Barriopedro and Calvo, 2014), and in evaluating the impact \n\n\n\n3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes \n \n \n\n69 \n \n\nof blocking patterns in the Iberian Peninsula using a high-resolution precipitation dataset (Sousa \n\net al. 2016). \n\nFollowing the latter work, the locations of the maximum Z500 for each identified blocking \n\npattern will hereafter be called blocking centers. The reduction of the large-scale blocked pattern \n\nto a single central gridpoint (representative of the entire blocking system) enables an objective \n\nseparation of blocking in different spatial sectors. Thus, three sectors were defined: the Atlantic \n\nsector (ATL) which includes all blocking centers located in 30\u00b0\u20130\u00b0W, the European sector \n\n(EUR), spanning 0\u201330\u00b0E and the Russian sector (RUS), including blocking centers positioned \n\nbetween 30 and 60\u00b0E. Figure 3.1 presents the annual mean frequency of blocking center \n\nlocations in each gridpoint. We must stress that this classification of blocks into ATL, EUR an \n\nRUS types intends to assess different precipitation responses and changes in precipitation \n\nregimes purely based on the geographical location of the considered high pressure system, which \n\nstrongly influences the synoptic environment associated to blocking occurrence in each \n\nconsidered sector. The selection of these blocking sectors is based on previous studies that have \n\nalready identified distinctive features in the resulting blocking signatures (Wang et al., 2010; \n\nMasato et al., 2011; Sousa et al., 2016). \n\n \n\nFig. 3.1 Thick black boxes identify the considered sectors for blocking center location: Atlantic \n\n(ATL)-from 30 W to 0 W; European (EUR)-from 0E to 30E; Russian (RUS)-from 30E to 60E. The \n\nshadings indicate the annual mean frequency of blocking center locations in each gridpoint. Blocks \n\noutside the 45 N to 70 N latitude strip were discarded in both sectors. Thin blue boxes identify areas \n\nwhich were considered in the regional assessment performed in Section 3.1.5. \n\n \n\nSeasonal composites of Z500 anomalies during blocking days in each sector are shown in Fig. \n\n3.2. Positive Z500 anomalies centered in the respective blocking sector dominate the northern \n\nlatitudes, being larger in the colder seasons for all sectors. They capture well the canonical \n\nsignatures associated with blocking over its climatologically preferred sectors of occurrence in \n\nthe Eurasian sector, which include eastern Atlantic, Scandinavian and the Urals, respectively. \n\n\n\n3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes \n \n \n\n70 \n \n\nNegative anomalies of the Z500 fields are less pronounced and usually found southwards and \n\nnorthwards of the blocking centers, mainly during ATL blocks. Also, in this region, summer \n\nblocks display a northward extension of subtropical wave-breaking systems near the Azores \n\nhigh. It is important to note that some blocking events contribute to the composites of more than \n\none sector during their lifecycle, since they tend to evolve eastwards towards Europe (Croci-\n\nMaspoli et al., 2007; Barriopedro et al., 2010a; Sousa et al., 2016). \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 3.2 Composites of the daily anomalies (shaded areas) and absolute values (isolines) of 500 hPa \n\ngeopotential height for blocking centers in each sector and for all seasons. All values are in \n\ndecameters (dam) and the thick line represents the 550 dam isohypse. \n\n \n\nAs a complement to highlight the large impacts resulting from zonal flow reversals which \n\noccur during blocking episodes, we also computed a catalogue of days were strong zonal flow \n\nconditions occur in the same three sectors (ATL, EUR and RUS). They represent strong westerly \n\nflows and hence a large-scale atmospheric pattern that is nearly opposite to that of blocking. \n\n\n\n3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes \n \n \n\n71 \n \n\nThey were computed following very simple criteria based on several empirical thresholds \n\nimposed on the meridional mid-latitude Z500 gradients to ensure a strong westerly flow. See \n\nTrigo et al. (2004) for further details on the methodology. \n\nExtratropical cyclones for the northern hemisphere were obtained by adapting the methodology \n\ndescribed in Trigo (2006a) and recently used to assess and intercompare the most common \n\nfeatures of mid-latitude cyclones, including the most active regions, the most common \n\ntrajectories, inter-annual variability and trends (e.g. Vicente-Serrano et al. 2011; Neu et al. \n\n2013), cyclone formation mechanisms and impacts (e.g. Liberato et al., 2012, 2013). The \n\nobjective cyclone identification is based on the detection of local minima in 1000 hPa \n\ngeopotential height. The cyclone tracking consists on a nearest neighbor search in the previous \n\nZ1000 field, considering several thresholds: (i) within a certain area, the cyclone speed should \n\nnot exceed 50 km/h in the westward direction and 160 km/h in any other. Additionally, the \n\ncyclone speed should be higher than 12 km/h. These criteria allow to include the most rapidly \n\ndeepening cyclones (e.g. Xynthia, Liberato et al., 2013) and to filter the stationary cyclones; (ii) \n\nduring the lifecycle the cyclone should reach a minimum central pressure corresponding to a see \n\nlevel pressure below 1020 hPa; (iii) a minimum lifetime of 24 h. \n\n \n\n3.1.3 Changes in mean precipitation rates \n\nIn order to evaluate the distinct impacts of the different blocking locations on precipitation \n\nregimes, we computed the composites for absolute and relative anomalies of daily precipitation, \n\nduring blocked and zonal days, in each of the three considered sectors, at the annual and seasonal \n\ntemporal scales (Figs. 3.3, 3.4). When evaluating the resulting relative anomaly composites one \n\nmust bear in mind the large range of precipitation values that coexist within such a large domain \n\nas the European continent. Thus, one must take into account that similar absolute anomalies in \n\nregions with very distinct total annual precipitation climatologies have different relevance. \n\nConsequently, to ensure this distinction we first considered the annual composites for the relative \n\nchanges in precipitation during blocked and zonal days, as presented in Fig. 3.3. \n\n\n\n3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes \n \n \n\n72 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 3.3 Annual composites for daily precipitation anomalies (%) in Europe during blocking (upper \n\nrow) and strong zonal flow (middle row) days in the ATL (left column), EUR (central column) and \n\nRUS (right column) sectors. The difference between the regional blocking and strong zonal flow \n\ncomposites is presented in the bottom row. Only statistically significant anomalies at the 5 % level \n\nare shown (two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 clearly shows that for the three considered sectors, the presence of blocking systems \n\nleads to well below average precipitation in a wide region under direct influence of the \n\nanticyclonic circulation. Maximum decreases of near 75 % are recorded in northern Europe near \n\nthe blocking centers, which corresponds to an almost complete cease of precipitating days. The \n\nmaximum negative anomaly is well collocated with the maximum Z500 anomaly of the \n\nrespective sector (Fig. 3.2), being more extensive for EUR blocking. On the other hand, the \n\nincrease in precipitation in southern areas of Europe, as well as in the Atlantic strip of \n\nScandinavia matches well with the negative Z500 anomalies, which arise northward and \n\nsouthward of blocking systems (as shown in Fig. 3.2). These positive precipitation anomalies \n\nshift eastwards with the considered blocking sector, thus following the relative west-east \n\nmigration of the maximum Z500 positive anomaly (blocking center). At the annual scale, the \n\nwidest positive anomalies are found for ATL blocks, during which a large portion of Iberia, Italy, \n\nand the Balkans region experience wetter than usual conditions. In particular, daily precipitation \n\nrates in southeastern Iberia almost double. \n\n\n\n3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes \n \n \n\n73 \n \n\nDuring strong zonal westerly flows these anomalies are essentially inverted, with a significant \n\nreduction in precipitation amounts at lower latitudes, particularly around the Mediterranean \n\nbasin. Much less significant losses are also found for northernmost areas of Scandinavia. On the \n\ncontrary, sharp increases in precipitation rates are found in most central and northern Europe, \n\nwith gains close to 100 % in Benelux, Germany and southern Scandinavia during strong zonal \n\nflows in the EUR sector. The difference between composites for blocked and zonal flows \n\nsharpens their opposite responses in daily precipitation anomalies, thus illustrating the very \n\nsignificant impacts of zonal flow reversals. \n\nThe presented changes in precipitation are in general good agreement with those in the \n\nfrequency of dry days (below 1 mm) - see Fig. 3.13 from the Supplementary Material. In Sect. \n\n3.5, we will address in more detail how the changes in the number of wet days are distributed for \n\ndifferent precipitation intensities. \n\nAs stated before, annual rainfall totals in the European domain range from a few hundred mm \n\nin dryer regions to several thousand mm in mountainous regions, particularly in Atlantic coastal \n\nareas (Haylock et al. 2008). This must be taken into account when analyzing relative anomalies, \n\nas a change of 50 % per day in a dry region/season corresponds to a much lower absolute \n\nprecipitation anomaly than in a corresponding wet region. Therefore, we now present (Fig. 3.4) \n\nthe corresponding seasonal analysis of Fig. 3.3 but based on the precipitation absolute anomalies \n\nat the seasonal scale. In this case, we summarize the results presenting the difference in daily \n\nrates between blocking and strong zonal flow days.  \n\n \n\nWhen using absolute anomalies, the relative changes are emphasized in regions where seasonal \n\nprecipitation amounts are high, as for example in central and northern Europe during most of the \n\nyear, or in easternmost interior areas during the warm seasons. Nevertheless, increases of 2-3 \n\nmm per day are significant in relatively dry areas (such as southernmost Europe), as previously \n\ndepicted in Fig. 3.3. When blocked conditions prevail, precipitation losses in the UK and central \n\nEurope are quite striking throughout the year. Summer precipitation responses often embrace \n\nlower spatial extensions; however, in some regions such as the northernmost countries and \n\nRussia\u2013where precipitation in form of snow is often recorded in colder months\u2013the summer \n\ndeficits represent the largest changes. \n\nThis seasonal analysis also helps distinguish seasonal precipitation responses that are masked \n\nat the annual scale. For example, during summer, blocking systems and their associated impacts \n\nshift north, and rainfall increases in parts of continental Europe\u2013suggesting a rise in convective \n\nprecipitation during summer blocks, as it will be discussed further ahead. \n\n \n\n\n\n3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes \n \n \n\n74 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 3.4 Seasonal composites for the differences in absolute anomalies of daily precipitation \n\n(mm/day) between blocking and strong zonal flow patterns in the ATL (left column), EUR (central \n\ncolumn) and RUS (right column) sectors. Only statistically significant anomalies at the 5 % level are \n\nshown. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.1.4 Synoptic and dynamics associated to different blocking locations \n\nTo better understand the processes triggering the precipitation anomalies associated with \n\nblocking (particularly relevant in southern Europe) we analyzed the changes in the frequency of \n\nextratropical cyclonic activity occurring during blocked and zonal regimes. According to Neu et \n\nal. (2013) a cyclone refers to a point (the cyclone center) identified on the Earth\u2019s surface at a \n\ncertain time using a certain methodology. The annual mean climatological frequency of \n\n\n\n3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes \n \n \n\n75 \n \n\nextratropical cyclone center locations in the Euro-Atlantic-Russian sectors is shown in the top \n\npanel of Fig. 3.5, along with their relative anomalies (in %) during blocked and zonal events in \n\neach sector. \n\n \n\nFig. 3.5 Top: annual mean frequency of non-stationary cyclone centers (counted in 2.5\u00b0 \u00d7 2.5\u00b0 \n\nboxes). Middle: row annual mean changes (in %) in the cyclone frequency during blocking episodes \n\nin the ATL (middle left), EUR (middle center) and RUS (middle right) sectors. Bottom: row annual \n\nmean changes (in %) in the cyclone frequency during strong zonal flow episodes in the ATL (bottom \n\nleft), EUR (bottom center) and RUS (bottom right) sectors. Increases are shown with blue shading \n\nand decreases with red shading. Stippling corresponds to areas with very low mean annual \n\nfrequency of cyclone occurrence (below 0.5 per year). \n\n \n\nA clear increase in cyclonic activity (non-stationary near-surface systems) in southwestern \n\nEurope is found during ATL blocks (Fig. 3.5, middle left), contrasting with an almost complete \n\ncutback in the UK area, where cyclonic activity is almost non-existent during blocking patterns \n\n(relative changes near 100 %). This decrease shifts eastwards as we consider blocking sectors \n\nfurther east. In the particular cases of EUR and RUS blocks, increases in cyclone frequency are \n\nalso found south of the blocking structures, although more spatially confined and much less \n\npronounced. These changes are in agreement with the well-known blocking effect on storm-\n\ntracks and the resulting split in two branches\u2013north and south of the blocking high. During zonal \n\n\n\n3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes \n \n \n\n76 \n \n\npatterns consistent increases in cyclone activity are found at higher latitudes, ranging from \n\nIceland to eastern areas of Scandinavia and northern Russia, along with an eastward extension of \n\nthe strongest branch of the Jetstream. On the southern flank of the Jetstream mean location we \n\nfind negative anomalies in the frequency of cyclones. These occur over large portions of western \n\nand central Europe during strong westerly flows in the ATL and EUR, which in the specific case \n\nof the former synoptic pattern contrast with simultaneous increases (reaching 50 %) in eastern \n\nMediterranean areas. Modest increases in extratropical cyclone paths at lower latitudes are also \n\nfound during strong westerly flow regimes. Nevertheless, these changes tend to be comparatively \n\nsmaller than those during blocking. Similar spatial patterns have been found for the changes in \n\ncut-off lows frequency during blocked/zonal conditions (Sousa et al., 2016; Nieto et al., 2007). \n\nAs expected, the southward shift in cyclonic activity during blocking episodes is in fair \n\nagreement with the decrease (increase) in precipitation in northern (southern) Europe. This \n\nimpact is particularly striking during ATL blocks, which exert the largest influence on the track \n\nof storms approaching Europe, and accordingly, on the European moisture sources of the \n\nAtlantic Ocean, as it will be detailed further ahead. On the other hand, the modest increases in \n\ncyclone frequency over some Mediterranean areas during zonal flows are not accompanied by \n\nsignificant rises in precipitation rates (Fig. 3.3). \n\nTo complement the obtained changes in cyclonic activity and deep further in the processes \n\nbehind the precipitation responses, we computed composites of Z500, LI, and IVT (and the \n\ncorresponding mean horizontal transport of IVT) for blocked and zonal days. The anomalous \n\nfields of these variables are shown simultaneously in Fig. 3.6, in order to evaluate concurrently \n\nthe dynamic and thermodynamical processes (including moisture fluxes and atmospheric \n\ninstability). \n\n\n\n3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes \n \n \n\n77 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 3.6 Annual composites of the daily Integrated Vapor Transport (IVT, in kg m?1 s?1, blue \n\nshading), and its anomaly in the bottom panels (brown to green shading), the Lifted Index anomaly \n\n(LI, in C, reddish thick lines), 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500, in dam, thin grey lines \u2013 the \n\nthicker grey line corresponds to the 550 dam isohypse) and mean horizontal transport (black arrows, \n\nkg m?1 s?1) for blocking (upper row) days, strong zonal flow days (middle row) days and their \n\ndifference (bottom row). Left, center and right columns correspond to composites for weather \n\npatterns occurring in the ATL, EUR and RUS sectors, respectively. \n\n \n\nThe composites during strong zonal flow days (Fig. 3.6, middle row) reveal a stretching of the \n\nhigh moisture content corridor from the Atlantic towards each considered sector, although in the \n\ncase of the RUS sector, moisture income towards this area is relatively modest. These extensions \n\ntowards each sector are on the overall quite coherent with the cyclonic signatures and the \n\nprecipitation anomalies during zonal days previously shown (Fig. 3.3). On the other hand, \n\nblocking structures obstruct these moisture fluxes (Fig. 3.6, upper row), being most of the \n\nmoisture transport deflected northwards. In the case of ATL blocks, these fluxes are diverted far \n\nfrom continental Europe and the UK, while during EUR blocks the northward deflection of the \n\nmoisture corridor occurs over Ireland towards Scandinavia. Moisture transport anomalies during \n\nRUS blocks are less striking, which agrees with the fact that larger precipitation anomalies in this \n\nsector are confined to summer (Fig. 3.4), when moisture fluxes are reduced. For the three \n\n\n\n3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes \n \n \n\n78 \n \n\nblocking sectors, there is also a modest transport towards lower latitudes (Mediterranean areas) \n\nthrough the southern flank of the blocking systems. In agreement with the precipitation \n\ndifferences between blocked and zonal patterns, the corresponding difference in moisture fluxes \n\nat the annual scale (Fig. 3.6, lower row) clearly shows that a shift from a westerly flow to \n\nblocked pattern results in an overall substantial decrease in moisture availability over western \n\nand central areas of Europe, and in a significant increase in northernmost Scandinavian areas. \n\nThe precipitation increases in southern Europe during blocking episodes do not reflect \n\nsignificant anomalies in available moisture. Instead, for southernmost latitudes, atmospheric \n\ninstability (depicted by the Lifted Index) appears to relate better with precipitation anomalies, as \n\nevidenced in the blocking minus zonal flow composites (bottom panels of Fig. 3.6). Moreover, \n\nthese changes in LI are spatially consistent with the changes in cyclonic activity frequency, \n\nsuggesting potential effects in the frequency of extreme precipitation days (as it will be analyzed \n\nin Sect. 3.5) in the regions located at the southern flank of blocking structures (i.e. in \n\nMediterranean areas). Thus, moisture availability is not a major constrain to the occurrence of \n\nsignificant precipitation events in southern Europe, at least at the annual scale. On the other \n\nhand, the small increases in cyclonic activity in the Mediterranean area which are found during \n\nzonal days (Fig. 3.5) are not collocated with the positive LI changes (located further north), \n\ntherefore supporting the weak precipitation effectiveness of low-latitude weather systems under \n\nzonal flows. All these facts reinforce the major role played by atmospheric instability on the \n\nprecipitation regimes of southern Europe, and its gradual loss of importance as we move north, \n\nwhere stratiform precipitation and moisture availability tend to dominate. \n\nDespite cyclonic activity increases in northern Europe extend to parts of central Europe during \n\nATL blocks (Fig. 3.5), the simultaneous reduction in moisture fluxes at these latitudes explains \n\nthe decrease in precipitation that can be found in areas such as southern France, parts of central \n\nEurope, or even northwestern sectors of the Iberian Peninsula. In this sense, it is important to \n\nstress that frontal precipitation associated to extratropical cyclones tends to occur to the south of \n\nthe cyclone center. As an example concerning the latter region, Sousa et al. (2016) noted that a \n\nlarge fraction of the precipitation that occurs in this area depends on frontal systems linked to \n\ncyclone centers located at higher latitudes, and whose frequency is strongly reduced during \n\nblocking situations. The same rationale can be applied to other regions as France and central \n\nparts of Europe during blocking events in the EUR sector. Thus, while at higher latitudes, the \n\nblocking-related decreases in precipitation are in good agreement with an obstruction of storm-\n\ntracks and associated moisture corridors, in southern areas, the agreement between blocking-\n\nrelated rainfall increases (Fig. 3.4) and above average atmospheric instability suggests a shift \n\ntowards more extreme precipitation regimes. \n\n\n\n3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes \n \n \n\n79 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 3.7 Seasonal composites for the positive (negative) changes in the daily Integrated Vapor \n\nTransport (IVT, in kg m?1 s?1) in green (brown) shading, the increment in atmospheric instability \n\nusing the Lifted Index (LI, in C) in reddish thick lines, the positive (negative) changes in the 500 hPa \n\ngeopotential height (Z500, in dam) in solid (dashed) thin grey, when shifting from strong zonal flow \n\nto blocked patterns in the ATL (left column), EUR (central column) and RUS (right column) sectors. \n\nArrows represent the mean horizontal transport of specific humidity. \n\n \n\nOverall, the seasonal composites (Fig. 3.7) resemble the annual, although a generalized \n\nnorthward shift can be noted during the warm season\u2013in good agreement with the corresponding \n\nmigration of the seasonal precipitation anomalies (Fig. 3.4). The pattern of enhanced \n\natmospheric instability in the areas southwards of blocking systems is considerably larger in \n\nwarmer months. During spring and summer the increase in instability is quite striking west of \n\nIberia (during ATL blocks), as well as in southern France and western Mediterranean areas \n\n(during EUR blocks). Interestingly, during summer, an outstanding rise in atmospheric instability \n\nduring RUS blocks covers a wide domain spanning from Turkey to Scandinavia. The fact that \n\nthis pattern is essentially restricted to summer explains its absence at the previous annual scale \n\n\n\n3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes \n \n \n\n80 \n \n\nanalysis. In effect, during summer some continental areas display precipitation decreases under \n\nblocked conditions, despite significant increases in atmospheric instability. We hypothesize that \n\nthe summer enhancement in atmospheric instability during blocked days must be insufficient to \n\noverwhelm the moisture inflow reduction associated with this atmospheric pattern. Thus, once \n\nagain we find that the precipitation responses in northern areas of Europe are well explained by \n\nchanges in moisture availability. Nevertheless, some mid-latitude continental areas show a \n\nseasonal shift towards wetter conditions during summer and autumn blocks, despite the overall \n\nreduction in moisture inflow. These regional warm season changes are concurrent with \n\nremarkable increases in LI and hence, the reasoning could be quite comparable to the one \n\npresented for southern Europe (essentially driven by atmospheric instability. In summary, this \n\nbalance between contrasting responses in terms of moisture flows and atmospheric instability \n\nbetween northern and southern Europe is, overall, well explained by a dominant role of moisture \n\nfluxes in the former, and of atmospheric instability in the latter, whose influence extends further \n\nnorth into continental Europe during the warmer months. \n\nThe atmosphere\u2013ocean coupling must be also considered in this context. In fact, variables such \n\nas Sea Surface Temperature anomalies and Latent Heat Fluxes (hereafter LHF) may play a role \n\non thermodynamic processes at both local scale (such as small scale convective systems), and \n\nsynoptic scale, such as cyclone life-cycles (Grams et al., 2011). As previously shown, LI changes \n\nare not always associated to concurrent changes in atmospheric circulation (e.g. cyclones), and \n\nhence, the underlying processes behind these LI changes (particularly important in southern \n\nareas) should be explored. Thus, we have analyzed changes in LHF during blocked and zonal \n\npatterns, as presented in Fig. 3.8.  \n\nAs it can be observed in the top panel of Fig. 3.8, the highest mean values of LHF (at the \n\nannual scale) are observed over the equatorial areas and the Gulf Stream in the Western Atlantic. \n\nThese areas with high rates of oceanic evaporation are the main large-scale sources of moisture \n\ncontent originated in the Atlantic which are carried towards Europe by typical westerly flows \n\n(Gimeno et al., 2013). Other regions, such as the Mediterranean area, may also be important \n\nsources of moisture for regional precipitation throughout evaporative processes (Gimeno et al., \n\n2010, 2012). Subsequently, we analyzed LHF anomalies during blocked or zonal synoptic \n\npatterns, as changes in evaporative rates should not be disconnected from the thermodynamic \n\nprocesses related with precipitation (particularly convection). \n\nAs shown in Fig. 3.8, strong zonal flows are related to above average LHF at higher latitudes, \n\nparticularly notable in the vicinity of the UK during ATL events, but also in the North Sea and \n\nBaltic Sea during EUR and RUS zonal flow episodes, respectively. On the contrary, at lower \n\nlatitudes, these zonal regimes result in below average LHF. During blocked conditions, there is \n\nan overall opposite response in terms of LHF anomalies. For example, during ATL blocks, a \n\nlarge area surrounding Iberia shows higher values of LHF (with maximum expression in the Gulf \n\nof Biscay). During EUR blocks this pattern shifts eastwards towards the eastern Mediterranean \n\n(particularly in the Aegian Sea), while during RUS blocks positive anomalies are restricted to the \n\nBlack Sea.  \n\n \n\n\n\n3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes \n \n \n\n81 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 3.8 Top: annual mean latent heat flux (counted in 2.5\u00b0 \u00d7 2.5\u00b0 boxes). Middle: row annual mean \n\nchanges (in W/m2) in the latent heat fluxes during blocking episodes in the ATL (middle left), EUR \n\n(middle center) and RUS (middle right) sectors. Bottom: row annual mean changes (in W/m2) in \n\nlatent heat fluxes during strong zonal flow episodes in the ATL (bottom left), EUR (bottom middle) \n\nand RUS (bottom right) sectors. Increases are shown with red shading (solid white lines) and \n\ndecreases with blue shading (dotted white lines). \n\n \n\nThis pattern of above average LHF in the southern flank of blocking systems may reflect \n\nenhanced evaporative processes under the advection of cooler air from higher latitudes due to the \n\neasterly/northeasterly synoptic flow. On the other hand, strong westerly flows extending to the \n\nsurface level may explain the increased LHF at higher latitudes during zonal regimes. Note that \n\nthe regions of increased LHF during blocked conditions do not display concurrent changes in \n\natmospheric circulation, but they agree with the regions experiencing increased precipitation. In \n\nthis context, positive LHF anomalies could help explain thermodynamic processes which \n\nregionally enhance atmospheric instability in southern areas of Europe during blocking episodes. \n\nTaking the Iberian Peninsula as an example, in Fig. 3.14 of the Supplementary Material we \n\npresent the forward trajectories of air parcels (at different altitudes) originated in areas where the \n\nmaximum LHF anomaly was found (e.g., the Gulf of Biscay) for a subset of days under ATL \n\nblocking. This pattern favors the transport and elevation of air parcels (originally at lower levels \n\nin the region with above normal evaporation) towards Iberia, thus possibly establishing a positive \n\n\n\n3.

Still, it is important to understand the underlying shifts in \n\ndifferent precipitation regimes (or intensities), which can be addressed looking at precipitation \n\ndistributions, or commonly designated PDF changes. In this section we perform a comprehensive \n\nassessment of modifications in precipitation distributions in some representative areas (identified \n\nin the boxes in Fig. 3.1) following a similar scheme as the one presented in Soares et al. (2014), \n\nand consisting in the next steps: \n\n(i) For each box presented in Fig. 3.1, we pooled together all the gridpoints, and then \n\ncomputed frequency histograms for wet days (days with rainfall above 1 mm) for 1 mm \n\nbins, without distinguishing weather regimes (HISTALL);  \n\n(ii) The frequency of each of these bins has been multiplied by its precipitation value, in \n\norder to obtain its relative contribution to the total precipitation climatology \n\n(CONTALL) of each box; \n\n(iii) The previous procedure was also applied to wet days under each specific weather \n\nregime and for each sector (thus obtaining CONTBLOCK and CONTZONAL); \n\n(iv) The difference between the bin contributions under each weather regime and the \n\ncorresponding all-days bin was then computed, in order to obtain the relative change in \n\nthe contribution of different daily precipitation intensities to the total precipitation \n\nanomaly ascribed to the specific weather regime, according to: \n\n \n\n \n\n(??????????? )  =\n?????????\n\n ????????\n \n\n??????????\n      (1) \n\n \n\n(??????????? )  =\n?????????\n\n ????????\n \n\n??????????\n      (2) \n\n \n\nThe computation described in Eqs. (1) and (2) has been performed for all three sectors \n\nconsidered previously (ATL, EUR and RUS), and NDAYS represents the number of wet days \n\noccurring in each of these specific weather regimes. \n\nSince the sample sizes for each specific weather regime and for each sector are different (and \n\nmuch smaller than the all-days sample size) we have applied a bootstrapping technique to enable \n\na fair comparison between them. To achieve this, the method estimates random subsamples of \n\ndays with the same size as that of the specific weather regime. Thus, for a given weather regime \n\nhaving NDAYS as sample size, we randomly selected NDAYS from the complete series and \n\nobtained the corresponding histogram, to perform an unbiased comparison. This random process \n\n\n\n3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes \n \n \n\n83 \n \n\nwas repeated 1000 times, and the average of the resulting histograms was taken as the final \n\nHISTALL. \n\nThe precipitation distributions of the four selected European regions and their shifts associated \n\nwith the occurrence of blocking and strong westerly flows over each sector are shown in Figs. \n\n3.9, 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12. In these figures, the upper panel shows the histogram of daily \n\nprecipitation for all wet days (above 1 mm, HISTALL) and the black curves show the contribution \n\nof each bin to the total precipitation (CONTALL), thus highlighting the daily intensities that are \n\nmore relevant to the total rainfall of each specific region. The middle panels show the relative \n\nchanges for each bin under each specific weather regime (CHANGEBlock and CHANGEZonal, \n\ndistinguishing between the three sectors considered), in order to compare the impacts that each \n\natmospheric pattern promotes in different precipitation intensities. Finally, the lower panels show \n\nthe cumulative relative changes from the previous panels, with the impacts of each considered \n\nweather pattern on the total precipitation distribution of the considered location.

Top: relative frequency of days with precipitation totals considering 1 mm bins (grey bars) \n\nand the corresponding contribution of each bin to the total annual precipitation (solid black line). \n\nMiddle: relative change in the contribution of each bin to the total annual precipitation for blocked \n\n(solid lines) and zonal (dashed lines) patterns in the three considered sectors (colored lines). Bottom: \n\ncumulative change resulting from the relative changes in the precipitation distribution associated to \n\neach blocked (solid lines) and zonal (dashed lines) pattern. The thin vertical lines represent different \n\npercentiles of total daily precipitation (considering only days above 1 mm). \n\n\n\n3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes \n \n \n\n84 \n \n\n \n\nThis approach enables a deeper assessment of the contrasting anomalies found in the \n\nprecipitation composites (Figs. 3.3, 3.4) for areas such as the UK (Fig. 3.9) or the Iberian \n\nPeninsula (Fig. 3.10). As stated before, ATL and EUR blocked patterns reduce daily \n\nprecipitation rates in the UK and foster them on most of the Iberian Peninsula, while the opposite \n\nresult is found for strong zonal flow days. The analysis of Fig. 3.9 provides a more detailed view \n\nof these differences, as it clarifies that blocked patterns in the ATL sector drastically reduce the \n\nnumber of moderate rainfall days in the UK region (below the 90th percentile), and increase the \n\nfrequency of low precipitation days, as compared to the climatology. The latter have a relatively \n\nminor contribution for the precipitation totals, while the former impinge a very large impact on \n\nthe accumulated relative changes of the precipitation distribution (Fig. 3.9, lower panel), with the \n\ntotal effect being a reduction of 40 % in annual precipitation. On the contrary, strong zonal \n\npatterns (particularly in the ATL and EUR sectors) induce an increase of the highly-contributing \n\nprecipitation bins (those near the median of the distribution), resulting in positive cumulative \n\nchanges, in clear agreement with the composites of the previous section. Thus, ATL patterns are \n\nthe most efficient in triggering shifts in precipitation distributions in the UK. \n\n \n\nOn the other hand, the differences in Iberian precipitation (Fig. 3.3) during blocked (zonal) \n\ndays in the ATL and EUR sectors are associated to an increase (decrease) in days with \n\nprecipitation amounts above the 50th percentile (Fig. 3.10). Contrarily to the UK, where blocked \n\nand zonal flows have minor impacts on the occurrence of extreme precipitating events, in the \n\nIberian Peninsula ATL and mainly EUR blocks are associated with a substantial shift in extreme \n\nevents (Fig. 3.10, middle panel), which largely influences the annual total differences in \n\nprecipitation (Fig. 3.10, lower panel). This is a strong evidence of the impact that blocked \n\npatterns have on the occurrence of intense to extreme precipitation days in this area, which are \n\nessentially driven by atmospheric instability, as referred in Sect. 3.4. These results help \n\ndistinguish the utterly different precipitation regimes, and the underlying processes, that \n\ndominate annual rainfall totals at different European latitudes. Still, we must bear in mind the \n\nexistence of large gradients in precipitation regimes that characterize some areas (particularly in \n\nsouthern Europe). Such different responses across regions and seasons, result in a smoothed \n\nsignal in the annual balance for the entire region. In the particular case of the Iberian Peninsula, \n\ndifferent local responses from the overall region\u2019s signals are found in northwestern areas during \n\nthe wet season (Sousa et al., 2016), as shown in Fig. 3.15 and 3.16 of the Supplementary \n\nMaterial. \n\n\n\n3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes \n \n \n\n85 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 3.10 Same as Fig. 3.9, but for the Iberian Peninsula. \n\n \n\nThe contrasting results between the UK and Iberian Peninsula shifts in the precipitation \n\ndistributions are similar to those found between central/northern Europe against the central \n\nMediterranean areas, the main difference residing on the zonal (blocking) sector with most \n\nimportant differences, which in the latter cases correspond to the EUR sector. Thus, zonal \n\n(blocked) conditions relate to an overall increase (decrease) in the number of moderate rainfall \n\ndays (largest differences around 5 mm/day rates) in most of central/northern Europe, while the \n\nopposite response is found at lower latitudes, where differences are more associated to the higher \n\npercentiles of daily precipitation intensity. Taking into account the similarity with the previous \n\ncases, we opted to remit the corresponding figures (3.17 and 3.18) to the Supplementary \n\nMaterial. \n\nWe also explored the shifts in the seasonal distributions. Overall, the results indicate a \n\nlatitudinal dependent behavior. Northern regions of Europe exhibit qualitatively coherent \n\nresponses to weather systems through the year, although the cumulative changes can display \n\nseasonal variations, following the seasonal cycle of precipitation and the factors that cause \n\nprecipitation anomalies therein (cyclonic activity and moisture availability). As an example, we \n\ndecided to present the differences in the summer precipitation distribution of the Russian box to \n\nemphasize the huge impact that summer blocking episodes exert on the climate of this region \n\n(Fig. 3.11). As in other northern/central European areas, the positive (negative) cumulative \n\n\n\n3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes \n \n \n\n86 \n \n\nchanges that arise from zonal (blocked) flows over this region are strongly influenced by \n\nvariations in the number of moderate rainfall days. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 3.11 Same as the previous, but for Russia, and considering only summer days. \n\n \n\nOn the other hand, the shifts in the precipitation distribution of southern European areas are \n\nmore likely to be seasonal dependent, as the seasonal cycle in precipitation is larger and the \n\nrelative contribution of extreme precipitation to the annual total is more important than in \n\nnorthern Europe. Figure 3.12 shows the PDF changes at the annual scale for Turkey. Significant \n\ndifferences occur in a wide range of percentiles, including the highest ones (above the 95th). \n\nHowever, there are clearly contrasting responses between winter and summer weather patterns \n\n(see Figs. 3.19 and 3.20 from the Supplementary material. There is not a clear opposite response \n\nto zonal or blocked flows, nor a coherent signal through the year. This fact suggests an important \n\nheterogeneity in precipitation regimes at both intra-annual and spatial scales in the region, when \n\ncompared to other European areas, and in particular with other Mediterranean sectors (Sousa et \n\nal., 2011). The fact that some other European areas do not show significant differences in the \n\nannual mean precipitation responses to blocked/zonal may be due to the co-existence of similar \n\ncontrasting signals, either in different seasons, or at different precipitation intensities of the \n\ndistribution. \n\n\n\n3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes \n \n \n\n87 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 3.12 Same as the previous, but for Turkey. \n\n \n\nIn summary, the presented cases denote that precipitation regimes in southern Europe are more \n\ndependent (than those at higher latitudes) of shifts in the higher percentiles of the daily rainfall \n\nintensity. In addition, heterogeneities at both spatial and temporal scales are also much more \n\nimportant than in northern Europe, where distributions tend to be qualitatively similar throughout \n\nthe year. Consequently, in northern regions, annual analyses of the precipitation distribution \n\nshifts are generally sufficient to examine the distinct impacts of blocked and zonal episodes, as \n\nthe shifts in highly-contributing moderate rainfall days prevail in these regions throughout the \n\nyear. \n\n \n\n3.1.6 Discussion and conclusions \n\nWe have performed a pan-European analysis on the impacts of blocking episodes and strong \n\nzonal flows on European precipitation regimes and the physical mechanisms associated. Unlike \n\nprevious studies, we have described the impact in annual and seasonal precipitation, thus \n\nincluding seasons other than winter, which has been the focus of previous assessments. We first \n\nanalyzed composites for precipitation anomalies, and afterwards, the precipitation distribution \n\nshifts over major regional domains, considering in all cases the effects of large scale circulation \n\nanomalies over three different areas of occurrence (mid-Atlantic, Europe and Russia). \n\n\n\n3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes \n \n \n\n88 \n \n\nOverall, the results indicate significant opposite precipitation responses to blocking occurrence \n\nbetween northern and southern regions of the continent. Positive net changes are found in \n\nsouthernmost areas, while negative net changes occur in most central and northern regions of \n\nEurope - exception made for the Atlantic strip of Scandinavia where variations in precipitation \n\npresent the same signal response as in southern Europe. The location of the largest precipitation \n\nanomalies follows well the positioning of the blocking centers, migrating eastward as we move \n\nfrom the Atlantic to the Russian sector. On the other hand, during strong westerly flows, the \n\nanomalies of this north\u2013south dipole are reversed, resulting in precipitation gains (decreases) at \n\nhigher (lower) latitudes. In the areas under direct blocking influence, the substantial decrease in \n\nprecipitation rates (reaching in some cases around 75 %) extends throughout the year, including \n\nareas where annual rainfall totals depend more on warm season\u2019s precipitation. In particular, the \n\ndramatic decrease in Russian precipitation during spring and summer blocking episodes gains \n\nparticular relevance under the scope of recent noticeable events, such as the mega-heatwave of \n\n2010 (Barriopedro et al., 2011). Our results reinforce the potentially outstanding impact of \n\nprolonged blocking episodes occurring over continental areas in terms of water availability (e.g., \n\nthe role of Russian blocks on the complex feedback processes between pre-conditioning soil \n\nmoisture deficits and summer heatwaves enhancement, Miralles et al., 2014; Garc\u00eda-Herrera et \n\nal., 2010). \n\nThe presence of blocking systems results in a bifurcation of storm-tracks north and south of \n\ntheir usual paths, as already described by Trigo et al. (2004) or Walter and Graf (2005). In large \n\nparts of central and northern Europe, where frontal systems associated to synoptic-scale \n\ndisturbances usually prevail, these storm-track shifts are responsible for the previously referred \n\nrainfall deficit due to the subsequent significant decreases in cyclone frequencies and moisture \n\ntransport. Contrariwise, during days characterized by strong zonal flow, our results demonstrate \n\nan increase in cyclonic activity and moisture transport towards northern and central Europe, \n\nconcurring with a rise in rainfall totals, associated to a stronger than usual Jetstream. In \n\nagreement with this main driver of precipitation anomalies in northern and central Europe, the \n\nstrongest effects are observed under the occurrence of circulation anomalies centered in the \n\nAtlantic and European sectors, which exert a major influence on the storm-tracks and moisture \n\nadvection inland. \n\nOn the other hand, in southern Europe, the branch of storm-tracks deflected southwards due to \n\nblocking occurrence is responsible for above average cyclonic activity. Again, this effect is \n\nparticularly relevant for blocking centers located in the Atlantic sector, resulting in twice as \n\nmuch cyclonic activity in the Iberian Peninsula area. Although not so striking, increases in \n\ncyclone frequency extend throughout many Mediterranean areas for other blocking locations. \n\nQuite the opposite, rainfall deficits in southern Europe are found for strong westerly flows, \n\nparticularly in western and central Mediterranean areas. \n\nWhile the rainfall increases over southern Europe during blocking agree with cyclonic activity \n\nanomalies, we have shown that they are better explained by increases in atmospheric instability, \n\nwhich are particularly notable in the southern flank of blocking systems. This process is not \n\nparticularly dependent of high moisture contents, as our analysis shows that these blocking-\n\n\n\n3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes \n \n \n\n89 \n \n\nrelated rainfall increases are concurrent with below average moisture influxes towards Europe. \n\nThis emphasizes the more convective nature of precipitation regimes of southern European \n\ncountries, when compared to a much more relevant contribution of frontal/stratiform systems at \n\nhigher latitudes. These results lead us to perform a more regionalized assessment of precipitation \n\nchanges and to highlight the meridional variation in precipitation responses and associated \n\nmechanisms. In this regard, we went further than previous studies by analyzing changes in the \n\nseasonal and annual precipitation distributions for a number of boxes in northern and southern \n\nEurope, during blocked and zonal regimes. \n\nWe show that the overall negative net changes in precipitation in most sectors of \n\ncentral/northern Europe are essentially driven by the substantial drop in the mid-percentiles of \n\nthe distribution (i.e., moderate rainfall days), which strongly contribute to the cumulative totals. \n\nInversely, during days characterized by intense zonal flow, an increase in the mid-percentiles of \n\ndaily precipitation rates highlights the vital role of synoptic-scale frontal systems and their \n\nassociation to a stronger Jetstream and the Atlantic moisture inflow. In contrast, in southern \n\nEuropean areas, the increases in precipitation rates during blocking episodes are mostly related \n\nwith increases in the mid to high percentiles of the precipitation distribution, in some cases \n\nparticularly striking above the 90th and 95th percentiles. This clearly shows an increase in the \n\nprobability of heavy to extreme precipitation days during blocked patterns, confirming the role of \n\nconvective processes in the blocking-related precipitation anomalies of southern Europe. Given \n\nthe significant contribution of heavy precipitation days to annual totals in this region, our results \n\nhighlight an outstanding role of blocked patterns on the inter-annual variability of southern \n\nEuropean rainfall regimes. \n\nIn most areas, the synoptic patterns and precipitation responses are quite coherent throughout \n\nthe year. However, the involved mechanisms differ in magnitude and spatial extent from season \n\nto season and affected areas. In particular, blocking occurrence and the associated increase in \n\natmospheric instability (and consequently in convective processes) to the south/southeast of \n\nblocking centers shift northward during summer, and as a consequence, positive precipitation \n\nanomalies also extend further north than during other seasons. Besides, we have also verified that \n\nwhile precipitation responses during blocked/zonal regimes are spatially coherent in central and \n\nnorthern Europe, the responses in southern regions are more complex. In this area, opposite \n\nresponses within relatively small domains (and/or between different seasons) can be masked on \n\nthe annual analysis (e.g. Iberia and Turkey). \n\nFinally, we discussed how processes such as latent-heat-fluxes may be determinant to both \n\ncyclogenesis and local feedback processes. In fact, blocked atmospheric patterns are associated \n\nwith above average evaporation in specific sectors, which may enhance atmospheric instability \n\nand/or provide a local moisture source for precipitation. In this context, parcel tracing and other \n\nocean\u2013atmosphere processes should be analyzed in more depth for a deeper assessment of local-\n\nscale processes, which may be particularly relevant in southern European areas. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n3.

In Section 3.3, we demonstrated that the variability in rainfall regimes and \n\nparticularly heavy precipitation events in southern Europe are closely related to the occurrence of \n\nhigh-latitude blocking. On the other hand, precipitation deficits in this area are related to \n\nanomalous high pressure systems at lower latitudes (e.g. Xoplaki et al., 2004). Santos et al. \n\n(2009) already associated very dry winters in Portugal to the occurrence of persistent sub-\n\ntropical ridge episodes in the eastern Atlantic, which reduce the number of frontal systems in the \n\nvicinity of northwestern Iberia, thus resulting in well below average rainfall during the wet \n\nseason.  \n\nTaking this into account, and making use of the developed catalogue of sub-tropical ridges, we \n\nalso explored the impacts on European precipitation during ridges in the ATL, EUR and RUS \n\nsectors. The composites for the seasonal precipitation relative anomalies (in %) are shown in Fig. \n\n3.21. \n\n\n\n3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes \n \n \n\n96 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 3.21 Seasonal composites of daily precipitation anomalies (%) in Europe for ridges in the ATL \n\n(left column), EUR (central column) and RUS (right column) sector. Only statistically significant \n\nanomalies at the 5 % level are shown (two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). \n\n \n\nSimilar to the temperature anomalies (particularly during winter) presented in Chapter 2, the \n\nprecipitation changes during ridge days are essentially opposite to those found for blocking days \n\n(Fig. 3.4). Consequently, ridge patterns are associated to well below average precipitation in \n\nmost of southern areas, where the maximum geopotential height anomalies of the ridge structure \n\nare located (see Fig. 2.2). The exception can be found during RUS ridges, which are located \n\nsufficiently to the east to still allow the penetration of Atlantic frontal systems towards the \n\nMediterranean area. It should be noted the similarities of the ridge signals in precipitation \n\n(particularly in winter and for central and northern Europe) with the corresponding patterns \n\nobtained for the zonal flows as shown in Fig. 3.22. \n\n \n\n\n\n3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes \n \n \n\n97 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 3.22 Same as Fig. 3.21, but for strong zonal flows. \n\n \n\nInterestingly, ridges promote the lack of rainfall over some areas. For example, most of Iberia \n\nis completely dry during ATL ridges. The same is true in southern Italy and most of the Balkans \n\narea during EUR ridges. The precipitation responses to ridges are quite coherent throughout the \n\nyear, although during summer the dry fingerprint of subtropical ridges extends further north, \n\nreaching central Europe and even the UK (particularly during spring and summer ATL ridges).  \n\nContrarily, central and northern areas of Europe are, on the overall, much wetter during ridge \n\noccurrence. During winter ATL ridges the Alpine region receives about 150% of the usual \n\nrainfall. Indeed, this natural barrier marks a clear separation in the north-south dipole of the \n\nprecipitation responses to ridges. These increases northwards of the ridge location agree with an \n\nenhanced zonal flow at higher latitudes, thus corroborating the similar composites found in Figs. \n\n3.21 and 3.22. These patterns are not detached at all, as a ridge structure and its corresponding \n\n\n\n3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes \n \n \n\n98 \n \n\npositive Z500 anomaly at low latitudes sharpens the north-south pressure gradient, thus favoring \n\nabove average zonal flow. \n\nIn this sense, while blocking events are related to precipitation scarceness in the northern half \n\nof Europe, ridges are a key driver of precipitation deficits in the southern half, and particularly \n\non the Mediterranean. This fact gains relevance in climates where water availability depends a \n\nlot on winter rainfall totals, being winter ridges a major drawback for annual precipitation totals.  \n\n \n\n3.3 Impacts on European snow-cover  \n\nSnow cover represents an important contributor to soil moisture in mid-to-high latitudes and \n\nmountainous regions. While accumulations at higher elevations (e.g. the Alps - Beniston, 2012) \n\ndepend mostly on the amount of precipitation, at lower altitudes, where snowfall is scarcer, \n\ntemperature anomalies will tend to dominate the anomalous snowfall patterns (Henderson and \n\nLeathers, 2009). As shown previously in Chapter 2, blocking events are often associated with \n\nsignificant cold spells in the European continent. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that blocking \n\npatterns will also play a significant role on the anomalous snowfall regimes of Europe (e.g., \n\nGarc\u00eda-Herrera and Barriopedro, 2006).  \n\nIn this section, the associated impacts on snow cover are explored by using the Global Snow \n\nLab from the Rutgers University Climate Lab (RUCL) dataset (Robinson et al., 2012), covering \n\nthe 1974-2012 period. The climatological frequency of winter days with snow covered soil is \n\npresented in Fig. 3.23, while the correlation between the anomalies of snow covered soil days \n\nand blocking/ridges frequency during winter for the three main 30\u00ba width sectors of the Euro-\n\nAtlantic region is represented in Fig. 3.24.  \n\n    \n\nFig. 3.23 Climatological mean winter (December-February) frequency of days with snow covered \n\nsoil (expressed in percentage with respect to the total number of winter days) for the 1974-2012 \n\nperiod. \n\n \n\n\n\n3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes \n \n \n\n99 \n \n\n                     ATL           EUR  RUS \nB\n\nlo\nc\nk\n\ns \n\n \n\nR\nid\n\ng\ne\ns \n\n \n \n\n \nFig. 3.24 Winter Pearson correlation coefficients (in percentage) between the frequency anomalies \n\nof snow covered soil and blocking (upper panels) and ridge (lower panels) occurrence in the three \n\nlongitudinal sectors: ATL, EUR and RUS. Only statistically significant correlations (at the 5% level) \n\nare shown. \n\n  \n\nThe upper panel of Fig. 3.24 shows that ATL blocks are associated with higher than average \n\nsnow cover days throughout most of Europe. As illustrated previously in Section 2.3, this pattern \n\nis related with significant cold advection of polar air masses towards the south of Europe (Fig. \n\n2.5). Such conditions lead to increases up to 50% in days with snow cover in central Europe, \n\ndespite the concurrent decreases in precipitation (Fig. 3.4), meaning that a larger fraction of the \n\nprecipitation occurs in the form of snow. The impacts even extend over large parts of Iberia, Italy \n\nand the Balkans. During EUR and RUS blocks, the anomalies are less significant, and located \n\nfurther east, in areas where snowfall days represent winter standard conditions (Fig. 3.23), thus \n\nbeing their frequency just slightly enhanced by blocking action.  \n\nAn almost completely opposite correlation is found for ATL and EUR ridges, resulting in \n\nmuch less days with snow cover in central Europe and the UK (lower panel in Fig. 3.24). This \n\nresult is anticipated, as ATL and EUR ridges are related to significantly warmer temperatures in \n\nmost regions (see Section 2.1). As a result, although precipitation totals are enhanced during \n\nthese regimes, snowfall becomes scarcer. Furthermore, the associated positive temperature \n\nanomalies (in the order of 5-10\u00baC) contribute to enhanced snow melting. Interestingly, during \n\nATL (EUR) ridges some Mediterranean areas, such as Italy (Turkey), present slightly increased \n\nsnow cover days, as some colder air masses plunge southwards in the eastern flank of the ridge \n\nstructures. During RUS ridges some appreciable increases can be found in western and central \n\nEurope, although not comparable in magnitude to those occurring during ATL blocks. As shown \n\nin Fig. 2.2, ridges located in easternmost areas of Europe allow an atmospheric pattern \n\ncharacterized by slightly increased northerly flow and below average Z500 in western Europe. \n\n  \n\n\n\n3.

Blocking impacts on Iberian precipitation and temperature \n \n \n\n102 \n \n\nSummary \n \n\nConte xt and obje ctive s  \nAs illustrate d in Chapters 2 and 3, there is a significant contribution of blocking (ridges) for \ncold (warm) and wet (dry) spells in the Mediterranean region. This chapter will focus on Iberia n \nprecipitation and temperature responses to blocking and ridge patterns occurring in the ATL \nand EUR sectors, as these regional systems wield the largest impacts on the Iberian climate. To \nperform this finer scale regional analysis, it was necessary to employ high-resolu t ion \nprecipitation and temperature datasets. A thorough assessment of the high-resolu t ion \nprecipitation responses to blocking in Iberia, which includes a comprehensive Extreme Value  \nAnalysis can be found in Section 4.1 (as publishe d in Sousa et al., 2016). Additiona l results on \nthe rainfall signatures during ridge patterns are described in Section 4.2, while Section 4.3 is  \ndevoted to regional temperature responses in Iberia under blocking and ridge patterns.  \n \nMe thods  \nWe use the IBERIA02 (precipitation) and SPAIN02 (temperature) datasets, at 0.2\u00ba x 0.2\u00ba \nhorizonta l resolution, and analyze the corresponding anomalies for each atmospheric pattern in \neach sector. Integrated Vapor Transport, the instability, as measured by the Lifted Index, \ncyclones and cut-off lows catalogues are used to characterize the synoptic environme n t.  \nChanges in Probability Density Functions and an Extreme Value Analysis are performed to \nexplore the relationships between blocking occurrence and precipitation regimes, includ ing \nextreme rainfall events in different regions of the Iberian Peninsula. \n \nRe s ults  \nSimilarly to other Mediterranean areas, blocking is associated with increased precipitation in \nmost of Iberia, except in the northwestern tip of the Peninsula. Despite the large-scale reductions  \nin moisture availability, the generalized rainfall increases are well explained by enhance d \natmospheric instability, partially driven by a southward deviation of the storm-track and \nincreases in cut-off lows. These changes are not concurrent with increases in the number of \nprecipitation days, thus highlighting the heavier behavior of precipitation regimes during \nblocking, which is particularly notable on the eastern shores of Iberia. Conversely, strong zona l \nflows, and especially sub-tropical ridges in the Euro-Atlantic sector result in more stable  \nconditions and precipitation scarceness in Iberia (except in the northernmost regions).  \nAn opposite response to blocks and ridges is also found in temperature, with blocking events  \nfavoring cold days in most areas (with temperature anomalies below -3\u00baC in winter), along with \nincreased cloudiness and wetter than average conditions. On the contrary, dryer and sunnie r \nweather conditions associated with ridges enhance sensible and short-wave radiative heating, \nthus promoting above average temperatures during both winter and summer. The specific  \nlocation of the ridge is determinant for regional extreme summer temperature events, with \nsubtropical ridges over Iberia triggering the largest anomalies in maximum temperature. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n4.

Liberato \n\nPaper published in Climate Dynamics (2016) \n\n \n\nIn this work we reassess the impacts of blocking patterns on precipitation regimes in the Iberian \nPeninsula, distinguishing between north Atlantic and European blocking. For this we take full \nadvantage of the recently developed high-resolution datasets for the Iberian countries. \nPrecipitation anomalies during blocking events obtained with this dataset allow a much finer \nregional characterization of the impacts on both average and extreme daily precipitat io n, \nparticularly when compared to widely used low-resolution reanalysis datasets. Blocked patterns \ninduce a negative-positive dipole of precipitation anomalies from northwest to southeast Iberia. \nIncreases are widespread during Atlantic blocks and pronounced in southern and eastern areas of \nIberia, while during European blocks they are more spatially restricted, with increases above 50 % \nin coastal Mediterranean areas, which represents a considerable fraction of the annual \nprecipitation. Blocking impacts on precipitation are nearly opposite to those found during strong \nzonal flow situations, but there are also some asymmetries in the precipitation responses. A \nsignificant increase in cyclones and cut-off lows frequency southwards of blocking structures is \nrelated to precipitation excesses over southern and eastern areas, where dynamical factors and local \nprocesses play a crucial role. On the contrary, precipitation deficits in northwest Iberia during \nblocking episodes are better explained by a reduction in north Atlantic frontal activity and \nsimultaneous decreases in large-scale moisture advection towards northern Iberia. We show that \nthese anomalies during blocking result from changes in precipitation amount rather than from \nincreases in rainy days, pointing to more extreme rainfall regimes, particularly in southeastern \nIberia. Finally, an Extreme Value Analysis was performed, fitting Generalized Pareto Distribut io ns \nto precipitation extremes. Results show that the different extreme precipitation regimes of \nnorthwest and Mediterranean regions are partially determined by opposite anomalies of the zonal \nflow. Thus, heavy precipitation events in Mediterranean areas are usually short-lived and \nfrequently associated with blocking conditions, while in northwest Iberia the total accumulat io ns \nduring rainfall episodes are more important for triggering extreme events and they are mainly \nrelated to strong westerly flows. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n4. Blocking impacts on Iberian precipitation and temperature \n \n \n\n104 \n \n\n4.1.1 Introduction \n\nThe climate of Europe is controlled to a large extent by the usual sequence of low-pressure \nsystems travelling from the west and associated with the jet stream. These mid-latitude cyclones \nleave their fingerprint on spells of varying precipitation amount, alternating with dry periods that \nrange from weekly to monthly scales. With the advent of upper level observations in the wake of \nthe WWII, it was found that this pattern of predominantly zonal circulation is often disrupted by a \ntemporary change to a situation of strong meridional flow (e.g., Rex, 1950a, b). This meridio na l \ncomponent favors the formation of quasi-stationary anticyclones at high latitudes, coined as \nblocking highs (Rex, 1950a, b), which are often accompanied by low-pressure areas at lower \nlatitudes (Treidl et al., 1981). \n\nThe influence of blocking systems on the climate of mid latitudes is well known. The first climate \nassessments of the impact of blocking were based on very few cases (e.g., Rex, 1951), or on \nparticular anomalous seasons (e.g., Quiroz, 1984). More recently, the longer reanalysis datasets \nhave been used to characterize blocking (e.g., Barriopedro et al., 2006, 2010a; Croci-Maspoli et \nal., 2007; Davini et al., 2012a) and their associated impacts (e.g., Trigo et al., 2004; Masato et al., \n2011), including extreme events (e.g., Sillmann and Croci-Maspoli, 2009; Buehler et al., 2011), \nsuch as the drought events in the Iberian Peninsula (IP) during 2004\u20132005 (Garc\u00eda-Herrera et al., \n2007) and 2011\u20132012 (Trigo et al., 2013a), or the more recent outstanding heatwaves in the Euro-\nRussian area (Barriopedro et al., 2011; Ruti et al., 2014). The specific role of atmospheric blocking \non precipitation regimes has been widely studied, although there is some tendency to focus on the \nclimate of the area more directly affected by the anomalous stationary ridge. In this restricted \nspatial context, blocking occurrence causes precipitation scarceness. Nevertheless, blocking \nepisodes may also increase precipitation in remote regions, since storm tracks tend to be deflected \nnorth and south of the blocking systems. Trigo et al. (2004) found that blocking episodes in the \nEuro-Atlantic sector reduce the precipitation rate at higher latitudes, and increase it in \nsouthernmost areas of Europe. In addition, blocking can be favorable for strangling upper level \ncold air pools (usually referred as cutoff lows), which may produce severe weather and flooding \n(Nieto et al., 2007). Cut-off lows are more frequent in spring and summer seasons, and in mid and \nlow latitudes, with the European sector being a preferred sector of occurrence. In particular, Nieto \net al. (2007) has shown that the southern flank of blocking systems is a favorable location for cut-\noff occurrence. This is crucial for the climate of the IP, where some of the most torrential rainfa ll \nepisodes can arise from relatively small-scaled low-pressure systems. Some examples of cut-off \nlow systems occurring under large-scale blocked conditions are the exceptional rainfall event in \nthe Lisbon area in 18 February 2008 (Fragoso et al., 2010), or the October 2000 torrential \nprecipitation event in eastern Spain (Homar et al., 2002). In addition, and particularly during late \nsummer and early autumn, cut-off lows can trigger Mesoscale Convective Systems affecting the \neastern coast of Spain and the Balearic Islands (Garc\u00eda-Herrera et al., 2005a).  \n\nWithin the context of blocking-related impacts, it is imperative to distinguish the disruption of \nthe prevailing westerly circumpolar flow by a blocking episode from the strengthening of the North \nAtlantic ridge at lower latitudes (40\u00b0N\u201350\u00b0N\u2014sometimes called low-latitude blocking), which is \nfrequently linked with sub-tropical high pressure systems. Santos et al. (2008, 2009) have studied \n\n\n\n4. Blocking impacts on Iberian precipitation and temperature \n \n \n\n105 \n \n\nthe latter, and linked such events with the occurrence of severe droughts in the IP, particularly in \nthe western half, since these patterns prevent storms from reaching that region. On the contrary, \nclosed and persistent blocking systems located at higher latitudes leave a margin for the occurrence \nof synoptic eddies at lower latitudes (e.g., Pfahl, 2014). More specifically, the blocking pattern \ninduces a shift of the usual storm-track paths that can interact with the sub-tropical jet stream, \nenhancing large-scale ascending motions, instability and the development of severe precipitat io n \nevents (Toreti et al., 2010). Thus, unlike strong ridges, which tend to deprive the IP of rains, \nblocking episodes can promote either dry periods or wet spells therein, depending on the location \nof the blocking pattern.  \n\nThe strong spatial and temporal variability of precipitation regimes in the IP, with the relative ly \nhigh frequency of blocking patterns (Barriopedro et al., 2006; Woollings et al., 2010a) and cut-\noff-lows (Nieto et al., 2007) in western Europe converts the IP in an excellent \u201claboratory\u201d to \nevaluate the impacts of blocking episodes. However, blocking induced low pressure systems may \nproduce very distinct signatures in precipitation at the regional scale. This underlines the need of \nhigh-resolution precipitation datasets to obtain a more comprehensive assessment on the impacts \nof blocking episodes on the IP precipitation regimes. Previous studies have used gridded \nprecipitation datasets with poor spatial horizontal resolutions to address blocking effects on \nprecipitation (e.g., Trigo et al., 2004), thus possibly losing crucial spatial details. Additiona l ly, \nTrigo et al. (2004) found that the blocking signals in precipitation are relatively unconnected from \nthose in precipitable water, which are rather controlled by blocking- induced temperature \nanomalies. This fact suggests that the precipitation anomalies in IP during blocking situations are \nmainly driven by dynamical factors, such as higher-than- usual cyclonic activity, albeit the \nimportance of thermodynamic factors in the precipitation responses to blocking cannot be \ndisregarded. This fact stresses the need to explore the blocking influence on cyclone paths, and \ncut-off lows in the region.  \n\nIn this study we perform a reassessment of blocking impacts on precipitation using the recently \ndeveloped Iberian high-resolution gridded precipitation datasets (Belo-Pereira et al., 2011; Herrera \net al., 2012). Moreover, we assess in detail how precipitation anomalies and associated \natmospheric circulation change with respect to the specific location of the blocking high patterns. \nThis spatial dependence may be crucial to determine the local impacts and extremeness of \nprecipitating systems like cyclones and cutoff lows. Finally, we also explore the relations hip \nbetween blocking and the occurrence of extreme precipitation. In summary, the main objectives \nof this work are: (1) to examine blocking impacts, in terms of precipitation anomalies and physical \nforcings (instability and moisture fluxes), distinguishing the sector of blocking occurrence; (2) to \nidentify changes in cyclonic activity and cut-off lows frequency during blocking episodes; (3) to \nperform an Extreme Values Analysis for Iberian precipitation during blocking episodes.  \n\nThis work is structured as follows. In Sect. 4.1.2, the data used in this work is described, and a \nbrief overview of the blocking climatology in the target domain is presented. In Sect. 4.1.3, we \nanalyze the impacts of different weather patterns (namely blocked and strong zonal flow) on the \nprecipitation regimes, and compare them when using datasets of different spatial resolution. The \nsynoptic patterns and forcings that promote these impacts are described in Sect. 4.1.4. An Extreme \n\n\n\n4. Blocking impacts on Iberian precipitation and temperature \n \n \n\n106 \n \n\nValue Analysis is performed in Sect. 4.1.5, and finally, in Sect. 4.1.6, the main results of this work \nare discussed.  \n\n \n\n4.1.2 Data \n \nReanalysis data \n\nWe have used the following datasets for the purposes of our analysis: \n\n(a) The recently developed high-resolution precipitation datasets for Portugal (PT02 - Belo-\nPereira et al., 2011), and Spain (SPAIN02 - Herrera et al., 2012), which have a horizonta l \nresolution of 0.2\u00b0 \u00d7 0.2\u00b0 and have been combined in a single dataset (IBERIA02) for the years \nspanning from 1950 until 2007. The average number of stations used by both datasets is very large \n(although not constant during the period), allowing its application for both climatological studies \n(e.g., Ramos et al. 2014), and characterization of extreme precipitation events (Ramos et al., 2015). \n\n(b) The dataset from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis (Kalnay et al., 1996) for the 1948\u20132007 period, \nat a 2.5\u00b0 \u00d7 2.5\u00b0 horizontal resolution. The variables explicitly considered were: daily fields of 500 \nhPa geopotential height (Z500) and Lifted Index (LI) - the latter is an instability index defined by \nthe temperature difference between an air parcel lifted adiabatically and the temperature of the \nenvironment at Z500. Furthermore, we made use of several fields from the NCEP/NCAR data to \ncompute the following data: (1) a catalogue of blocking events (Barriopedro et al., 2006); (2) a \ncatalogue of cut-off lows (COL - Nieto et al., 2005); (3) Integrated Water Vapor Transport between \n1000 and 300 hPa (IVT- Ramos et al., 2015); (4) a catalogue of cyclones for the northern \nhemisphere obtained by using the methodology described in Trigo (2006a). These datasets will be \nemployed to explore the blocking signatures in precipitation regimes and interpret these responses \nin terms of dynamical (cyclones, COLs) and thermodynamical (IVT, LI) processes. The particular \ncharacteristics of the blocking catalogue are explored in more detail in the following sub-section. \n \n\nBlocking index catalogue \n\nThe catalogue of blocked days was developed by Barriopedro et al. (2006) by using daily Z500 \ndata on a 2.5\u00b0 \u00d7 2.5\u00b0 grid. It is an adapted version of the Tibaldi and Molteni (1990) index. \nBlocking events can be identified when the averaged zonal index, computed as the 500-hPa height \ndifference between 40\u00b0 and 60\u00b0N, is negative over 30\u00b0 in longitude and during five or more days. \nTo exclude spurious blocks due to the occurrence of cut-off lows, an additional negative height \ngradient northward of 60\u00b0N is demanded. A blocking event is detected when at least three \nconsecutive longitudes appeared as blocked during at least five days. Two Z500 gradients (GHGN \nand GHGS) have been simultaneously computed for each longitude and for each day of study over \nthe North Hemisphere: \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n4. Blocking impacts on Iberian precipitation and temperature \n \n \n\n107 \n \n\n???????? =  ??\n(??,????) ???(??,??0)\n\n???????0\n    \n\n???????? =  ??\n(??,??0) ???(??,????)\n\n??0?????\n   (1) \n\n?N = 77.5 N + ? \n\n?0 = 60.0 N + ? \n\n?S = 40.0 N + ? \n\n? = -5.0\u00ba; -2.5\u00ba, 0.0\u00ba, 2.5\u00ba, 5.0\u00ba  (2) \n \n\nwhere Z(?,?) is the Z500 at a given latitude and longitude. GHGS is proportional to the zonal \ngeostrophic wind component and provides a measure of the zonal flow intensity for each longit ude, \nwhile GHGN is imposed in order to exclude non blocked flows. An arbitrary longitude is \nconsidered blocked when both GHGN and GHGS verify the condition expressed by Eq. (3) for at \nleast one of the five ? values and simultaneously the ?0 height anomaly is positive. The detection \nscheme also incorporates a procedure to detect the center of blocking events (maximum Z500 \ngridpoint within the anticyclonic flow), a blocking intensity index, and a spatial and temporal \ntracking algorithm.  \n\n \n\nIn this study, we only considered daily blocking patterns for which the maximum Z500 anomaly \nis located between 45\u00b0N and 70\u00b0N, and these locations will hereafter be called blocking centers. \nWe must stress that this definition has the purpose to enable an objective separation in blocking \nsectors by reducing the large-scale of the blocking pattern to a single gridpoint that is \nrepresentative of the weather system, as the specific location of a blocking center plays a major \nrole in defining the synoptic circulation of a much wider region. Thus, two main sectors are \ndefined: the Atlantic sector (ATL) which includes all blocking centers located in 30\u00b0W\u20130\u00b0W, and \nthe European sector (EUR), spanning 0\u00b0E\u201330\u00b0E. This regional classification is justified from \nprevious works that have explored the relationship between blocking and the main modes of \nvariability of the atmospheric circulation (e.g., Barriopedro et al., 2006; Scherrer et al., 2006). \nThese studies have reported a tight link between blocking activity and the centers of variability of \nthe leading modes in the Euro-Atlantic sector, with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the \nScandinavian Pattern (SCA) explaining most of the variability of ATL and EUR blocking, \nrespectively. ATL and EUR blocking have also very distinct signals in European precipitation and \ntemperature (e.g., Masato et al., 2011). Figure 4.1 (top) depicts the annual mean frequency of \nblocking center locations in each gridpoint (2.5\u00b0 \u00d7 2.5\u00b0), as well as the seasonal frequency of \nblocking centers for each considered sector (bottom). It must remain clear that the main goal of \nclassifying blocks into ATL and EUR types is to assess how the precipitation responses depend on \nthe blocking location. Thus, this distinction between ATL and EUR blocks is purely based on their \nlocation, and does not necessarily involve different physical/dynamical processes in their \nlifecycles. \n\n\n\n4. Blocking impacts on Iberian precipitation and temperature \n \n \n\n108 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 4.1 Top: boxes identifying the considered sectors for block ing center location: ATL - from 30\u00b0W \nto 0\u00b0W; EUR - from 0\u00b0E to 30\u00b0E. The shadings indicate the annual mean frequency of blocking center \nlocations in each gridpoint. Block s outside the 45\u00b0N-70\u00b0N latitude strip were discarded in both sectors. \nBottom: Seasonal frequencies of block ing center location in each sector during 1950\u20132007 (in \npercentage relative to the total number of days in the season). \n \n\nBefore evaluating the regional impacts of blocking on the IP precipitation, it is important to briefly \ncharacterize the atmospheric circulation signatures associated with regional blocking occurrence. \nFigure 4.2 shows the composite of Z500 anomalies for blocking days in each sector and season. \nFor both sectors, Z500 positive anomalies are larger in the cold seasons than in the warm seasons. \nThe largest anomalies are associated with ATL blocking. In this region, summer blocks display a \nnorthward extension of subtropical wave-breaking systems near the Azores high. Regional \nblocking is also associated to negative Z500 anomalies in some of the surrounding areas, being \nmore evident during ATL blocks and in colder seasons, but less pronounced than the positive ones. \nThese negative anomalies display different intensity and location for ATL and EUR blocks, which \nsuggest different impacts on precipitation, thus supporting the classification in blocking sectors \n\n\n\n4. Blocking impacts on Iberian precipitation and temperature \n \n \n\n109 \n \n\nadopted herein. Note that some blocking events may contribute to the composites of both sectors, \nsince ATL blocks tend to evolve eastwards towards Europe throughout their lifecycle (Croci-\nMaspoli et al., 2007; Barriopedro et al., 2010a). This is supported by similar composites (see \nSupplementary Material \u2013 Fig.4.12) performed for blocking subsectors of 15\u00b0 longitud i na l \nextension within the ATL and EUR regions. \n\n \nFig. 4.2 Composites of the daily anomalies (shaded areas) and absolute values (isolines) of 500 hPa \ngeopotential height for block ing centers in each sector and for all seasons. All values are in decameters \n(dam) and the thick  line represents the 550 dam isohypse. \n\n \n4.1.3 Seasonal impacts of blocking in Iberian precipitation \n\nWith the aim of evaluating the impacts of blocking on the IP precipitation, seasonal composites \nof daily precipitation anomalies were calculated for days with blocking centers in each sector. For \n\n\n\n4. Blocking impacts on Iberian precipitation and temperature \n \n \n\n110 \n \n\nthis purpose, daily anomaly series of precipitation in each gridpoint were computed, and then \ncomposited for blocking days of each season and sector. We opted to present the relative anomalies \nin the composites (in percentage relative to the climatological seasonal precipitation during 1950\u2013\n2007), as seen in Fig. 4.3. Gridpoints where the climatological seasonal mean total precipitation is \nbelow 50 mm were discarded, since relative anomalies in dry areas may be misleading. This \nprocess excludes dryer regions in southern/central IP, where summer rainfall is usually scarce \n(Belo-Pereira et al. 2011), and the relevance of high anomalies would be doubtful. A two-sample \nSmirnov-Kolmogorov test (hereafter KStest) was applied to assess the statistical significance of \nthese anomalies (Wilks, 2011). \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 4.3 Seasonal composites of daily precipitation anomalies (%) in the Iberian Peninsula for \nblock ing center days in each considered sector using (and comparing) the low-resolution NCEP/NCAR \ndataset with the high-resolution IBERIA02 dataset. Regions where the anomalies are statistically \nsignificant at the 5 % level are represented with dots. Anomalies for gridpoints with total seasonal \nprecipitation below 50 mm were not considered (grey crosses). \n\n\n\n4. Blocking impacts on Iberian precipitation and temperature \n \n \n\n111 \n \n\nThe composites presented in Fig. 4.3 show that, with the exception of summer, the seasonal \npatterns of regional blocking signals in precipitation are reasonably coherent throughout the year, \nparticularly for ATL blocks. The NCEP/NCAR reanalysis composites show a consistent positive \nprecipitation anomaly in the Mediterranean coast associated with blocking occurrence in both \nsectors. In particular, during winter, the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis displays very minor differe nces \nbetween the impacts of ATL and EUR blocks. However, the high-resolution IBERIA02 dataset \nreveals specific regional details in these patterns and clear differences between ATL and EUR \nblocks. For example, significant negative precipitation anomalies are found in northwestern \nregions of the IP that cannot be clearly identified using the low-resolution dataset. In summer, the \nNCEP/NCAR reanalysis displays a SW\u2013NE gradient response in precipitation anomalies that is \nabsent in the high-resolution dataset. We must bear in mind that most of IP registers low mean \nprecipitation values during these months and, consequently, one should refrain from \noveremphasizing summer anomalies. \n\nRegarding the different impacts that arise from different blocking locations, it is found that for \nmost of the year (with the exception made for spring), ATL blocks are associated with increased \nprecipitation over wide areas of the IP, while EUR blocks tend to bring more localized positive \nanomalies, particularly in coastal Mediterranean strips. For instance, during autumn, ATL blocks \nlead to above average precipitation in almost the entire peninsula. Taking this example, once again, \nthe impact of the different resolutions from the datasets appears very clear, as EUR blocking \ncomposite for the NCEP/NCAR dataset clearly miss most of the positive autumn precipitat io n \nanomalies that are depicted by the corresponding IBERIA02 composite. \n\nTaking into account the tendency for eastward blocking migration mentioned above, we have \nalso computed the precipitation anomaly composites occurring in the previous 5 days to EUR \nblocks. These composites show a quite similar pattern (see Supplementary Material \u2013 Fig. 4.13) to \nthe one found for ATL blocking, thus confirming that the transition from the ATL to the EUR \nprecipitation composites partially reflects the transient responses to an eastward blocking \nmigration and hence, that the precipitation responses to blocking depend on the blocking location. \n\nWith the aim of summarizing the different impacts of regional blocking, we computed annual \ncomposites of daily precipitation anomalies for each blocking sector. Furthermore, to better \ninterpret the blocking signatures we compared them with the corresponding composites obtained \nfor days characterized by strong zonal flow, which represents a large-scale atmospheric pattern \nwith nearly opposite anomalies to those associated with blocking. This procedure allows assessing \nthe linear response in precipitation to opposite zonal flow regimes. For this purpose, we followed \nvery simple criteria described in Trigo et al. (2004) to classify strong zonal flow days in the \nAtlantic and European sectors: (1) a given longitude is affected by strong zonal flow conditions if \nthe meridional mid-latitude Z500 gradients exceed several empirical thresholds (see Trigo et al., \n2004 for further details); (2) the entire sector is considered to be in strong zonal flow configura t io n \nif at least three adjacent longitudes satisfy (1). The KStest was applied to assess the statistica l \nsignificance of these anomalies. \n\nThe annual composites of daily precipitation anomalies for regional blocking and strong zonal \nflow conditions are shown in Fig. 4.4. The existence of a negative\u2013positive dipole in precipitat io n \n\n\n\n4. Blocking impacts on Iberian precipitation and temperature \n \n \n\n112 \n \n\nanomalies under blocking action is again evidenced at the annual scale. For both blocking sectors, \nthe positive precipitation anomalies found in eastern and southern coastal areas are considerably \nwider in spatial extension and larger in amplitude than the negative anomalies found in \nnorthwestern IP, which are essentially restricted to ATL blocks. During strong zonal episodes there \nis also a tendency for a northwest-southeast dipole in precipitation anomalies, but with the opposite \nsignals to those found during blocking conditions. Strong westerly flows are related with below \naverage precipitation in southern and eastern IP, and with near-normal or non-significa nt \nprecipitation excess in the northwest. As a consequence, the differences between blocked and zonal \nconditions depict an even more contrasting dipole, which reflects the large relevance that blocking \nepisodes wield on rainfall regimes in southern and eastern regions of Iberia, where we once again \nstress that mean annual rainfall totals are much lower than for northwestern sectors (Belo-Pereira \net al. 2011). \n\n \nFig. 4.4 Annual composites of daily precipitation anomalies (%) in the Iberian Peninsula for blocking \n(left column) and strong zonal flow (center column) days in the Atlantic (upper row) and European \n(lower row) sectors. The difference between the regional blocking and strong zonal flow composites is \npresented in the right column. Only statistically significant anomalies at the 5 % level are shown. \n \n\nAs stated above, the high-resolution precipitation data set allows identifying important \ndifferences between the regional and local precipitation responses associated with ATL and EUR \nblocks that otherwise would be missed in a coarser grid. Thus, during ATL blocks positive \nanomalies cover a wider area than that affected by EUR blocks, and also the locations of the largest \nanomalies are different depending on the considered sector. In particular, during EUR blocks there \nis a particular emphasis on the coastal strip of eastern Spain, while under ATL blocks the highest \n\n\n\n4. Blocking impacts on Iberian precipitation and temperature \n \n \n\n113 \n \n\nanomalies are found further south in eastern Spain, and also in southernmost areas of the IP and \nthe Gibraltar area. On the other hand, a sharp northwest-southeast gradient is found for ATL \nblocks, while EUR blocks show a less pronounced gradient, and a slight northward shift of the \nassociated maximum of precipitation, as compared to ATL blocks. Also, the deficit of precipitat io n \nin northwest IP is clearly identifiable for blocking located in the ATL sector, but it does not reach \nthe 5 % statistical significance level in the EUR composite. The same regional differences are \nobserved in the blocking minus strong zonal flow composite difference. \n\nAnother interesting difference between the ATL and EUR composites is their different linear \nresponse to blocked and zonal flows. Thus, the precipitation response to opposite anomalous \nconditions in the westerly flow over EUR is largely linear, while for the ATL sector there are \nimportant asymmetries. It should be noticed that part of these results may be due to a larger \ndifference between the frequencies of blocked and zonal days for ATL when compared to EUR. \nIn particular, the precipitation signals over eastern IP during ATL blocks are much larger than \nthose observed during strong zonal flow conditions. This implies that the precipitation regimes of \nthese areas are particularly sensitive to blocked conditions. Such asymmetric responses to \ncirculation anomalies in the ATL sector are much more difficult to identify when relying on \ncomposites obtained using the NCEP/NCAR low-resolution dataset, once again reinforcing the \nconvenience of the high-resolution dataset. \n\n \n\nThe impact of blocking events in the precipitation regimes of the eastern and southern sectors of \nIP (Fig. 4.4) coupled with the considerably lower climatological precipitation values observed in \nthese regions necessarily imply a considerable contribution of blocking episodes on total yearly \nprecipitation therein (solid lines, upper panels Fig. 4.5), which exceeds 10 % in eastern areas of \nthe IP. We were also interested in checking if the precipitation anomalies during blocking patterns \nare derived from an equivalent change in the number of rainy days, or from changes in the \nprecipitation amount during precipitating days. To address this question, we computed regional \nblocking composites of the anomalous number of days with total precipitation above 1 mm. The \nresults (Fig. 4.5, shaded) indicate a large decrease in the number of rainy days over the \nnorthwestern half IP and much smaller changes elsewhere. The pronounced drop of rainy days in \nnorthwestern IP (in some areas above 20 %) only impinges a slight decrease in total precipitat io n \n(Fig. 4.4). We argue that this result could be due to blocking mainly inducing light precipitat ing \ndays in the NW sector of IP, thus leading to small net changes. The decrease in the number of rainy \ndays during blocking situations also affects other large portions of the IP, including regions where \nthe precipitation composites showed significant increases in total precipitation. This suggests that \nthe precipitation responses to blocking are largely attributable to changing rates of precipitat io n \nrather than to the number of precipitating days, especially in southeastern IP. Naturally, this also \ninvolves a higher frequency of intense or torrential precipitation days during blocked patterns in \nthese regions, as it will be discussed further ahead. \n\n \n\n\n\n4. Blocking impacts on Iberian precipitation and temperature \n \n \n\n114 \n \n\n \nFig. 4.5 Increase (blue shades) or decrease (red shades) in the number of days with total precipitation \nabove 1 mm during block ed patterns (upper panel) and strong zonal flows (lower panel), when \ncompared with the complete 1950\u20132007 climatology (in percentage). Solid black  lines represent the \ncontribution (in percentage) of the corresponding synoptic pattern to the annual total precipitation. \n\n \n4.1.4 Synoptic forcing \n\nOnce the impacts of regional anomalous zonal flow conditions on IP precipitation regimes are \nwell characterized, it is important to understand the processes that drive them at the synoptic scale. \nAs shown in previous works, blocking occurrence induces positive precipitation anomalies in \nseveral areas of southern Europe, but it does not promote higher values of precipitable water in the \nsame areas (e.g., Trigo et al., 2004). Thus, it is mandatory to distinguish processes that enhance \nmoisture availability from those that provide the favorable conditions for water condensation. For \nthis purpose, we computed anomalous composites (for blocked and strong zonal flow situatio ns) \nof Z500, LI, and IVT (and the corresponding mean horizontal transport of IVT). In this way, we \nwere able to compare the distribution of moisture fluxes (throughout the use of the IVT) and \nsimultaneously the anomalies in instability (LI). The former is related to moisture availability for \nprecipitation and the latter measures whether the environmental conditions are prone to enhance \ncondensation of water vapor. The composites have been performed for blocked and zonal days, \nand their difference, as depicted in Fig. 4.6. \n\n\n\n4. Blocking impacts on Iberian precipitation and temperature \n \n \n\n115 \n \n\n \nFig. 4.6 Annual composites of the daily Integrated Vapor Transport (IVT, in k g m?1 s?1, blue \n\nshading), the Lifted Index anomaly (LI, in \u00b0C, reddish thick  lines), 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500, \nin dam, thin black  lines - the thick er line corresponds to the 550 dam isohypse) and mean horizontal \ntransport (black  arrows, k g m?1 s?1) for blocking (left panel) days, zonal (middle panel) days and their \ndifference (right panel). Upper (lower) row panels correspond to the Atlantic (European) sector \ncomposites. \n \n\nThe composites of Fig. 4.6 show that during strong zonal conditions there is a corridor of high \nmoisture content transport extending towards the British Isles and affecting northwestern IP. This \nmoist corridor is zonally elongated towards central Europe during strong zonal flow conditions \nover EUR, as compared to those occurring in ATL. Blocking patterns efficiently obstruct these \nmoisture fluxes, which is in good agreement with the rainfall reductions observed in NW IP during \nblocking patterns, but not with the precipitation increases in southeastern IP. However, areas of \npositive LI anomalies are found in the IP during blocking episodes, with a dependence on the \nconsidered sector. Thus, atmospheric instability tends to be reinforced in western (eastern) IP \nduring ATL (EUR) blocking days, in good agreement with the precipitation increases obtained in \nthe previous section over southern (eastern) IP. Moreover, the difference between blocked and \nzonal flow composites shows a large increase in atmospheric instability over IP when we shift \nfrom zonal to blocked flows, despite their common reduction in moisture content at higher \nlatitudes. This suggests that moisture availability is not a major limiting factor to explain the \nprecipitation responses to anomalous zonal flow conditions over most of the IP. In fact, these \ncomposites show that the positive precipitation anomalies in south and eastern IP during blocking \nepisodes are related with the increment of atmospheric instability in the target areas. \n\nAdditionally, we would like to explore whether the changes in moisture content and instabilit y \nare triggered by specific weather systems. Trigo et al. (2004) already discussed the important role \nplayed by the southward deflection of the storm-tracks in the European precipitation responses to \nblocking episodes. Thus, taking into account the main synoptic patterns that trigger precipitat io n \n\n\n\n4. Blocking impacts on Iberian precipitation and temperature \n \n \n\n116 \n \n\nevents in the IP, we next explore changes in their frequency during blocking and strong zonal flow \nepisodes for each considered sector. In this regard, we herein distinguish between near-surface \ncyclones and upper-level low-pressure systems such as COLs, both causing negative Z500 \nanomalies (as those found over the IP in the blocking minus strong zonal flow composites of Fig. \n4.6). To achieve this, we first looked at the climatological frequency of cyclones and COL in the \nEuro-Atlantic area, as presented in the top panels of Figs. 4.7 and 4.8, respectively. The results \nreflect some well-known facts: (1) the North Atlantic is a preferred region for storm-tracks, with \nnorthwestern IP being commonly affected by them (Fig. 4.7); (2) the Mediterranean basin (and the \nIP in particular) are the regions in the Euro-Atlantic sector where COL activity is more frequent \nthroughout the year (Fig. 4.8). We next check the amplitude and significance of eventual changes \nin their frequency (as compared to climatology) during blocking episodes for both the ATL and \nEUR sectors. We also explore if there is an agreement between cyclonic and COL blocking-related \ntracks and the already mentioned increases in atmospheric instability during these events. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe anomalies in cyclone activity (non-stationary near surface systems) show a clear increase in \nmost areas close to the IP during ATL blocks (Fig. 4.7, middle left), in contrast with a sharp \ndecrease in the UK, where cyclonic activity is almost non-existent during blocking patterns. For \nEUR blocks (Fig. 4.7, middle right) the cyclone frequency decrease is shifted eastwards (over the \nScandinavia region), in good agreement with the location of the blocking high (Fig. 4.2), but the \nincrease in cyclonic activity elsewhere is predominantly non-significant. Note that despite the \ncyclone increase over the IP there is also a reduction in moisture fluxes to the north of the IP during \nblocking conditions (Fig. 4.6), which may explain the decrease in precipitation found in NW IP. \nIn this regard, it must also be reminded that a large fraction of the precipitation that occurs in this \nregion is related to frontal systems that are linked to cyclone centers located at higher latitudes \n(Trigo et al., 2004) and whose frequency is strongly reduced during blocking situations. This is \nsupported by the ATL blocking composites of Figs. 4.6 and 4.7, which show that the maximum \ndecrease in cyclonic activity occurs to the north of the corresponding decrease in moisture content. \nThus, the precipitation deficits in NW IP during ATL blocks can be attributed to a decrease on the \nfrequency of efficient Atlantic low-pressure systems affecting high latitudes (and the subsequent \ndecrease in moisture fluxes in the vicinity of northwest Iberia). \n\n\n\n4.

Black  dots represent the areas with significant decreases that do \nnot achieve that threshold. \n\n \n\n\n\n4. Blocking impacts on Iberian precipitation and temperature \n \n \n\n119 \n \n\nConcerning changes in COLs activity, results show a significant increase around the Iberian \nPeninsula domain during ATL blocks (over 150 % in some areas) as presented in Fig. 4.8. There \nis also an increase during EUR blocks, but displaced towards Eastern Europe, although still \nappreciable in eastern IP (~50 %). The increase in COL and transient cyclones activity during ATL \nblocks is in fair agreement with the increase found in precipitation and atmospheric instabilit y \nanomalies in southern IP. Regarding the responses found during EUR blocks, there is a slight \ndecrease in cyclonic activity close to northeastern Iberia (Fig. 4.7), contrasting with a small \nincrease of COL activity in the Mediterranean coast of the IP (Fig. 4.8). This fact suggests that the \ninitial stages of COLs - corresponding to troughs located over the region which later develop and \nmature into COLs towards the east\u2014may be the main cause for the significant increases in \natmospheric instability and precipitation in the area. \n\nFurthermore, the analysis of Fig. 4.7 (bottom panel) shows that in the IP region the responses in \ncyclone frequency to strong zonal flows are similar for the two sectors (both negative). This fact \nshows that the different precipitation responses to ATL and EUR zonal flows (see Fig. 4.4) are \nlikely not related to changes in cyclone paths. On the contrary, the areas of higher reduction in \nCOLs shift eastwards from ATL to EUR zonal flows (Fig. 4.8), apparently in better agreement \nwith the respective regions of negative precipitation anomalies (Fig. 4.4). Still, we must bear in \nmind that both cyclones and COLs analyses were performed on coarser grids when compared to \nthe high-resolution precipitation dataset, thus losing some information about the dependence of \nthe precipitation responses on small changes in the location of these synoptic systems. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.1.5 Extreme value analysis \n\nAs stated in the introduction, several areas of the IP are often affected by episodes of torrential \nprecipitation, with significant contributions to seasonal totals, and important socio-economic \nimpacts. This is particularly true for the eastern coasts of the IP, as the presence of warm \nMediterranean waters (especially at the end of the summer and the beginning of autumn) fosters \nsuch precipitation regimes (e.g., Garc\u00eda-Herrera et al., 2005a). We must bear in mind the results \nfrom Sect. 3, where it was evident that the significant increase in rainfall during blocking episodes \nover this region was not a result of an increase in the number of rainy days, thus suggesting a \nhigher rate of heavy precipitation episodes during such atmospheric patterns. To check the \nefficiency of regional blocking patterns in promoting extreme rainfall events, we first computed \nthe ratio between the frequency of blocking and strong zonal flow days with total precipitat io n \nabove the local 90th percentile for the ATL and EUR sectors, as presented in Fig. 4.9. \n\n\n\n4. Blocking impacts on Iberian precipitation and temperature \n \n \n\n120 \n \n\n \nFig. 4.9 Extreme precipitation efficiency: quotient between the number of block ing days with daily \nprecipitation above the 90th percentile and the number of zonal days with daily precipitation above \nthe 90th percentile (in %) in the ATL (left panel) and EUR (right panel) sectors. Quotients above the \n100 % isoline (thick  black  lines) are represented by dark er reddish shading. \n \n\nEasternmost regions of Spain (for ATL and EUR blocks) and southernmost regions of Spain and \nPortugal (for ATL blocks) have higher ratios of extreme days during blocking episodes, when \ncompared to strong zonal flows. The opposite result is found for northwestern IP, where the rainiest \ndays are more associated with strong zonal flow patterns. Scrutinizing in further detail these \ndifferent extreme precipitation regimes, we performed an extreme value analysis on the high-\nresolution precipitation dataset in order to: (a) identify regions with homogeneous extreme \nprecipitation regimes and find the model that better fits to their tailed distributions; (b) analyze the \ncontribution of different weather regimes to extreme daily precipitation episodes in these distinct \nsectors. \n\nSeveral authors have shown that the Generalized Pareto (GP) Distribution provides adequate fits \nfor one-side tailed distributions as the one found for precipitation extremes. The use of this type \nof fit for precipitation extremes is useful to model parameters such as probability maps of specific \nthreshold exceedances, or return levels and periods. For example, Vicente-Serrano et al. (2009) \nused this fit to model extreme precipitation events in areas of Spain during different phases of the \nNAO and the Mediterranean Oscillation, and Toreti et al. (2010) characterized extreme winter \nprecipitation in Mediterranean coastal sites in association with anomalous atmospheric circulat io n \npatterns. \n\nWhen performing an extreme value analysis, we must bear in mind that the sample sizes of \nextreme episodes need to be large enough to provide satisfying fits. This is not the case for all \nconsidered gridpoints of the dataset, as in some areas heavy precipitation events are particular ly \nrare. Furthermore, adjusting such a large number of local models requires some caution, taking \ninto account that the associated errors resulting from each particular fit may eventually lead to \nunreliable results. Hence, the spatial comparison and coherence of such a large number of fits must \n\n\n\n4. Blocking impacts on Iberian precipitation and temperature \n \n \n\n121 \n \n\nbe considered carefully. For this reason, we opted to first apply a spatial aggregation scheme, by \nconsidering four boxes of gridpoints. These boxes (Fig. 4.10) have been defined taking into \naccount the different responses in precipitation regimes found in the previous sections, as well as \nareas where extreme events are spatially coherent and often lead to abundant precipitation and \nhave more severe impacts. In addition, a fifth test box was defined in central areas of the IP, to \ncheck the fit in a region with a different regime of precipitation extremes. In order to perform this \nspatial aggregation of the data, it is necessary to check if these sub-domains defined heuristica l ly \nactually represent homogeneous regions in terms of the extreme precipitation distribution. For this \npurpose, we used a methodology based on the L-Moments, where a statistic H1 checks the degree \nof heterogeneity of a region in terms of precipitation extremes (for further details on the \nmethodology see Hosking and Wallis, 1997). This test was applied separately to each box by \nconsidering the gridpoint sub-series containing only rainy days with precipitation above the local \n90t h percentile. For all boxes, the H1 statistic presented values lower than 1, i.e., below the required \nthreshold to consider regions as homogeneous (Hosking and Wallis, 1997). Since the defined \nregions are homogenous, for each specific day we considered the absolute maximum of all \ngridpoints inside the box, in order to obtain the precipitation extreme daily series of each box. Such \na process significantly increases the number of extreme precipitation records, as compared to that \nobtained by considering fits for individual gridpoints. \n\n \n\nFig. 4.10 Boxes defined for the Generalized Pareto fit: northwest (BOXNW); north (BOXN), southwest \n(BOXSW); east (BOXE) and central (BOXC). These boxes were defined tak ing into account the \nprecipitation anomaly patterns found in Section 3.1.3, and also the Iberian Peninsula geography and \nsocioeconomic factors. \n\n \n\n\n\n4. Blocking impacts on Iberian precipitation and temperature \n \n \n\n122 \n \n\nThe above mentioned extreme daily series of each box were then used to assess whether the \nfrequency of extreme precipitation events in each box and for different weather regimes is large \nenough to perform the extreme value analysis. Table 4.1 presents the number of rainy days with \nprecipitation above the 90th percentile, and the frequency of such extremes occurring under \nblocked and zonal days. This exercise also allows analyzing the effectiveness of each considered \nweather pattern on promoting extreme precipitation days in the different areas of the IP. \n\n \n\nTable 4.1 Number of extreme rainy days (above 1 mm, with total precipitation above the 90th \npercentile) for each box, and the relative contribution of each considered weather pattern (in \npercentage with respect to the total number of extreme rainy days). \n\n \n \n\nAs it can be seen from Table 4.1, the sum of extreme days during blocked and zonal patterns \ncorresponds to almost half of the total extreme days for any of the considered boxes. In the case \nof BOXNW and BOXN, the contribution of blocking to extreme precipitation days is near 15 %, \nwhile that of strong zonal flows is around 30 %. In BOXSW and BOXE, these results are reversed, \nin agreement with the overall pattern presented in Fig. 4.9, thus reinforcing the idea that blocking \nfavors extreme events in these regions, while strong zonal flows (mainly those occurring over the \nATL) are more decisive for extreme precipitation in the Atlantic areas of the IP. Regarding BOXC, \nthere is a similar contribution of blocked and strong zonal flows, albeit with slightly higher \npercentages of extreme events during blocked patterns, particularly when they are located over the \nEuropean sector. Therefore, the number of extreme precipitation events occurring under blocking \nand zonal flows is large enough to perform an extreme value analysis. \n\n \n\nWe next explored the theoretical model that better captures the distribution of the extremes daily \nseries of each box. This was done by applying different models to the daily series of each \nconsidered box and constructing L-Moment Ratio diagrams to visually check the convenience of \neach fit (Fig. 4.11). These diagrams clearly point to the GP fit as the most suitable one for our \nextreme precipitation series in all boxes. Besides this visual inspection, we later checked the \ngoodness-of-fit of models for each sub-region using the Anderson\u2013Darling test (Wilks, 2011), as \nit will be detailed further ahead. \n\n\n\n4. Blocking impacts on Iberian precipitation and temperature \n \n \n\n123 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 4.11 L-Moment Ratio diagrams for series of precipitation days above the 90th percentile in the \nfive considered boxes inside the Iberian Peninsula. Different curves represent different types of \nExtreme Value distributions and grey dots correspond to the observed values in each box. \n \n\nIn order to perform the GP fit (Beirlant et al., 2004) for extreme precipitation events in each box, \nwe have followed a scheme similar to the one presented by Vicente-Serrano et al. (2009). Thus, \nwe defined discrete blocking and zonal events as sequences of at least 4 days under those particular \nsynoptic conditions. While blocked events are more frequent over Europe, zonal patterns are more \nfrequent in the ATL sector. The results of this classification indicate that zonal events tend to last \nlonger than blocked events (~9 and ~7 days, respectively), and that for both types of events ATL \npatterns persist for slightly longer periods than EUR patterns. Then, once again using the extreme \ndaily series of the individual boxes (previously obtained from the daily maxima inside each of \nthese sub-regions), we obtained two different new time-series for each box, each one having a \nsingle precipitation value associated to each specific weather event. These two series are \ncomprised by: (1) the maximum daily value of each event (PMAX); (2) the accumulated \nprecipitation of each event (PTOT). This has been done in order to perform a temporal declustering \nover sequences of rainy days, and thus to avoid the presence of serial dependence or persistence. \n\nNext, for each box, we followed a peak-over-threshold approach, by calculating the high \npercentiles of the series of rainy days, and then applying GP fits for the corresponding tails of the \nPTOT and PMAX time-series obtained for both weather patterns (blocked and strong zonal flow \nevents). In order to decide the more appropriate percentile threshold, we relied on both graphical \n(probability\u2013probability plots, see Supplementary Material, Fig. 4.14 and Fig. 4.15) and formal \n(Anderson\u2013Darling test) selection techniques. Taking this into account we finally opted for the \n\n\n\n4. Blocking impacts on Iberian precipitation and temperature \n \n \n\n124 \n \n\n90th percentile as a final threshold, and all presented GP fits were performed for the tail series \nbased on this threshold. The confidence levels for the fits, as well as their corresponding tail and \nshape parameters are presented in Tables 4.2 and 4.3. \n \n\nTable 4.2 Confidence levels (bold) after the Anderson\u2013Darling test, the tail parameter, and the scale \nparameter of each GP fit applied to the tailed distribution (above the 90th percentile) of the PMAX \nseries of the five considered boxes of gridpoints, during block ing (left columns) and strong zonal events \n(right columns) in the ATL and EUR sectors. \n\n \n \n\nTable 4.3 Same as Table 4.2, but for the PTOT time series. \n\n \n \n\nOverall, the confidence levels obtained after performing the Anderson\u2013Darling test are high \n(above 90 %), thus giving us confidence on most of the performed fits, and once again reinforc ing \non the convenience of the GP fit to model precipitation tail distributions. The location parameter \nof the fits illustrates very well the different contribution of distinct weather regimes to extreme \ndaily precipitation episodes at the regional scale. Higher values of this parameter are found for \nblocked patterns in southern and eastern areas (BOXE and BOXSW), contrarily to northern regions \n(BOXN, BOXNW and BOXC), where higher values are found for zonal flows. These regional \ndifferences become clearer when we analyze PTOT, for which the changes on the location \nparameter from blocked to zonal flows are higher, particularly for BOXNW. This is not surprising, \nsince: (1) extreme precipitation days in Mediterranean (Atlantic) areas of the IP are strongly linked \nto blocked patterns (strong zonal flows); (2) large sequences of moderate to heavy rainfall are \nfrequent in northwest Iberia during strong zonal synoptic conditions; (3) torrential episodes in the \nMediterranean coasts occur essentially at shorter time scales. We must recall that the mean \nduration of strong zonal flow events is slightly larger than that of blocking events. This is obviously \nimportant when comparing the probabilities for PTOT, as different mean durations involve \ndifferent expected accumulated values. \n\nThese results confirm the existence of different extreme precipitation regimes between \nnorthwestern and southeastern sectors of the IP, with the former being related to persistent \n\n\n\n4. Blocking impacts on Iberian precipitation and temperature \n \n \n\n125 \n \n\nmoderate precipitating events and the latter by short-lived intense episodes. They also demonstrate \nthat these regional differences are to a large extent due to different triggering large-scale weather \nregimes (strong zonal flows and blocking patterns, respectively). These distinct atmospheric \nconfigurations play a very different contribution to the occurrence of extreme events in those \nregions, and although they are both related to anomalies of the zonal flow, they exhibit nearly \nopposite synoptic features and very different persistence signatures, thus shaping regional \ndifferences in the tailed distributions of precipitating events. \n\n \n\n4.1.6 Discussion \n\nIn this work, we made a reassessment of blocking impacts on precipitation regimes over the \nIberian Peninsula, taking advantage of the recently developed high-resolution datasets for the two \nIberian countries. The simple comparison between blocking composites obtained using a low-\nresolution dataset (NCEP) and the high-resolution dataset (IBERIA02) clearly shows that only the \nlatter can represent adequately specific regional impacts. Furthermore, the difference between the \nimpacts caused by blocking episodes in different sectors (Atlantic and Europe) is also perfectly \nclear using the high-resolution data. Overall, blocking occurrence induces a negative to positive \nmarked dipole in precipitation from northwest to southeast Iberia, with a northeast shift of the \nlargest positive anomalies from ATL blocks to EUR blocks. We must recall that the blocking \nstructures tend to migrate eastwards in most cases, and hence the regional precipitation responses \npartially reflect blocking impacts at different stages of the blocking lifecycle. \n\nIncreases in precipitation rates above 50 % are found in some regions during blocked synoptic \npatterns. In particular, positive precipitation anomalies extend to most of the IP domain during \nATL blocks, being larger in southern and southeastern areas of the IP, while during EUR blocks \nthey tend to be more restricted to eastern Mediterranean regions. Nevertheless, the relevance of \nblocking on precipitation vanishes as we move towards the northwest. In these regions, the blocked \npatterns only contribute to less than 10 % of the total mean annual precipitation. Nearly opposite \nresults are obtained for strong zonal flows. However, there are some important asymmetries in the \nprecipitation signals between zonal and blocked patterns, suggesting some non-linear responses to \nchanges in the westerly flow. \n\nThe synoptic configurations associated with blocking show negative Z500 anomalies to the south \nof the blocking centers. As a consequence, during blocking situations, storm-tracks tend to be \ndeflected southwards, towards the IP domain, explaining part of the precipitation excess found \nover Iberia. Still, this shift is not completely compatible with the blocking-related precipitat io n \ndeficits in northwest Iberia. In this case, changes in transport and moisture availability during \nblocking days (involving a reduced efficiency of Atlantic frontal systems located northwards of \nthe IP) explain the reduction in rainfall amount. Other important dynamical factors seem to play a \nrole in the precipitation responses to blocking over the Mediterranean region. In particular, the \nsimultaneous increases in low pressure systems (particularly cut-off lows) affecting the area and \natmospheric instability help to understand the blocking signatures in precipitation over the \nMediterranean coast. This important rise in the frequency of cut-off lows in the IP area (particular ly \n\n\n\n4. Blocking impacts on Iberian precipitation and temperature \n \n \n\n126 \n \n\nduring ATL blocks) is in agreement with Nieto et al. (2007), which noticed the increase of COL \nactivity in the southern flank of Euro-Atlantic blocking systems. This sustains the importance of \ndynamical factors in shaping the precipitation regimes of the IP, especially in the Mediterranean \nareas. Furthermore, the high-resolution dataset reveals substantial differences on the precipitat io n \nresponses to blocking over relatively small regions (mainly in the Mediterranean). This indicates \na major importance of local processes (such as moisture convergence and deep convection) on the \nprecipitation regimes of that part of Iberia and calls for further investigation, including the \nrelevance and impact of Sea Surface Temperatures, and their connections and feedbacks with the \nparticular synoptic patterns that arise from blocking situations. \n\nOn the other hand, we have found that, for most of the IP, the precipitation increases associated \nwith blocking are due to changes in precipitation amount rather than changes in the number of \nprecipitation days. In fact, despite the overall increase in precipitation under blocking action, there \nis either a concurrent decrease in the number of measurable rainfall days in most of the regions of \nIberia (more pronounced in NW Iberia) or irrelevant changes in the number of rainy days. This \nfact indicates that rainfall regimes during blocking days are more extreme in southeastern Iberia, \nwhere the blocking contribution to annual totals is the greatest. The results are supported by the \nexistence of a northwest-southeast dipole in the rate of days with extreme precipitation occurring \nunder strong zonal flow and blocking. \n\nFinally, we have performed an Extreme Value Analysis, fitting Generalized Pareto distribut io ns \nto maximum daily precipitation and total accumulated precipitation series for distinct \nhomogeneous sub-regions inside the IP during blocking and strong zonal episodes. This approach \nshows that extreme precipitation events during blocking conditions tend to be short-lived (i.e., \nisolated extremes at the daily scale), mainly in the Mediterranean, while zonal events are more \nrelevant concerning the total episode accumulated precipitation in northwest Iberia. \n\n \n\nAck nowledgments Pedro M.

Bearing in mind that some local signatures (particularly during summer \nridges) are highly dependent on small shifts of the subtropical ridge location (see Section 2.1), here \nresults are shown for subtropical ridges occurring within the four 15\u00ba longitudinal sectors that can \nimpinge a significant impact in Iberia, namely: ATLW (30W-15W), ATLE (15W-0W), EURW (0E-\n15E) and EURE (15E-30E).

Only \nstatistically significant anomalies at 5% significance level are depicted. \n \n\nAs it can be seen in the upper panels of Fig. 4.16, ridges in both ATL subsectors, as well as in \nEURW result in dramatic decreases in daily precipitation rates. This is crucial for Iberian water \navailability, since most areas strongly depend on winter precipitation, which is the wettest season. \nThese results are in good agreement with Santos et al. (2009), who stressed the key role played by \neastern Atlantic ridges on Iberian drought episodes. Still, this high-resolution grid provides further \ndetails, which are masked in coarser datasets. For example, during ATLW ridges, the Cantabria \nregion and the western Pyrenees have increased rainfall, contrarily to all other areas. This may be \nexplained as follows: a ridge located far enough to the west of Iberia still enables northerly moist \nflows towards those mountainous areas, whereas the intense north-south F\u00f6hn effect will prevent \npositive precipitation anomalies south of the mountain ranges. For ridges located over Iberia \n(ATLE), decreases are striking over the entire peninsula, with some areas receiving no precipitat io n \nat all. On the other hand, ridges located eastwards (EURE) are sufficiently distant to produce \nsmaller impacts on precipitation. \n\n\n\n4. Blocking impacts on Iberian precipitation and temperature \n \n \n\n130 \n \n\nDuring summer (Fig. 4.16, lower panels), the overall precipitation reductions are less significa nt \nand not so homogeneous, with larger spatial variability in the regional responses. It should be \nstressed that most areas are quite dry during this season (particularly central and southern sectors \nof the peninsula), and therefore these intense negative anomalies are relatively meaningless. Still, \nit is possible to find some significant localized precipitation increases during summer ATLW  \nridges, as well as in northwestern Iberia during EURW ridges. Nevertheless, the relative ly \ngeneralized negative impact on precipitation remains dominant in most areas for the majority of \nsub-regional ridge structures occurring in the ATL and EUR sectors, with the largest signal being \nassociated to ATLE systems. \n\n \n\n4.3 High-resolution Iberian temperature responses to blocks \nand ridges \n\nUsing the blocking and ridge catalogues, a finer scale analysis on high-resolution temperature \nresponses over Iberia to those atmospheric patterns has also been performed. Similarly to the high-\nresolution Iberian precipitation dataset (IBERIA02), a maximum and minimum temperature \ndataset has been developed by Herrera et al. (2012), at the horizontal resolution of 0.2\u00ba x 0.2\u00ba. \nHowever, unlike the precipitation dataset, the temperature dataset is only currently available for \nSpanish meteorological stations. Thus, all results shown in this section do not include the \nPortuguese area of the Iberian Peninsula. \n\nComposites of winter and summer maximum temperature anomalies during blocking and ridges \nare presented in Fig. 4.17 and Fig. 4.18, respectively. As in the previous section, here we show \nresults for the weather systems occurring within the following 15\u00ba longitudinal sectors: ATLW, \nATLE, EURW and EURE. \n\nOn the overall, the anomalies found over Iberia resemble those from the E-OBS dataset (Fig. \n2.12 and Fig. 2.13), with cold temperatures being associated to blocks, and warm temperatures \nprevailing during ridges. Nevertheless, some regional particularities arise, which were not so well \ncaptured by the sparser E-OBS dataset. For example, there is a region with near normal maximum \ntemperatures in the Ebro valley during winter EURW ridges, contrasting with the overall warming \nIberian response to this pattern. This difference is likely induced by prolonged foggy episodes that \nare frequent in this area, under stable anticyclonic conditions (Cuxart and Jimenez, 2010). On the \nother hand, the largest minimum temperature anomalies during winter ridges tend to occur in some \nmountainous areas, suggesting subsidence and thermal inversion patterns. It should be noted that \nthe winter increases in maximum temperature during ridge episodes are larger than those observed \nfor minimum temperature, due to reduced cloud cover under stable conditions and thus an increase \nof solar radiation during the day and also the loss of infrared radiation at night. In fact, some \nsouthwestern areas of Iberia experience slightly below average minimum temperatures during \nATL ridges. Finally, the impact of the ridge patterns centered over the Iberian Peninsula (ATLW  \nand EURE) display a considerable stronger maximum temperature anomaly than the two other \nregional systems (Fig. 4.17). \n\n\n\n4.

Only statistically significant anomalies at 5% \nsignificance level are depicted. \n \n\nDuring winter blocking events, the associated decreases in maximum temperature are also larger \nthan in minimum temperature, resulting in reduced daily amplitudes, particularly for ATL blocks \n(Fig 4.17). This is in agreement with the concurrent increase in cloud cover and precipitation, as \nshown in Sections 3.1 and 4.1, due to the blocking- induced southerly deviation of the storm-tracks. \nThe temperature responses over Iberia during summer blocking (Fig. 4.18) are qualitatively similar \nto the ones found during winter, due to a combination of reduced insolation, and cold advection \nfrom higher latitudes in the eastern flank of the blocking systems (as previously discussed in \nSection 2.1). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n4.

Overall, the \nincreases in minimum temperature associated to ridges are smaller, resulting in larger amplit udes \nof the daily temperature cycle, which can be explained by radiative heating (see Section 2.1.4). \nThe composites of temperature anomalies during summer ridges are striking, being particular ly \ngeneralized for ATLE and EURW ridges, with most areas experiencing anomalies above +3\u00baC. The \ntemperature responses are particularly notorious in central Spain during ATLE ridges, or \nnortheastern Spain during EURW ridges (particularly the Pyrenees), which reach +7\u00baC.  \n\n \n\nIt is worth noting that anomalies are almost non-existent for ridges occurring in neighbor ing \nsectors to the Iberian peninsula, i.e. EURE and ATLW, thus confirming that the exact location of \nthe sub-tropical ridge axis is paramount to determine the areas that experience extremely warm \nconditions (Section 2.1).

Besides \n\ntemperature and precipitation series, other climate-related phenomena, which are relevant from a \n\nsocio-economic and environmental perspective (such as droughts and wildfires), are conditioned \n\nby the occurrence of blocking and sub-tropical ridge patterns. In Sections 5.2 and 5.3 additional \n\nexamples of the impacts associated to blocking and ridge patterns are provided, which were \n\nconsidered outside the scope of the papers presented in Chapters 2-4. Particular attention is \n\ndevoted to feedback processes between blocking/ridges and droughts, and their mediating role \n\nduring the pre-fire season in the inter-annual variability of burnt areas in the Mediterranean basin. \n\nFurthermore, and taking into account the: 1) observed changes in Mediterranean droughts and \n\ndrying trends in future projections; 2) previously discussed links between ridges and \n\nMediterranean drought variability; 3) lack of studies addressing future changes in sub-tropical \n\nridges (as opposed to the abundant literature about future blocking projections), a brief outlook \n\nand preliminary discussion of recent trends and future changes in sub-tropical ridges is provided \n\nby using models from the CMIP5 project.  \n\n \n\nMethods \n\nThe European Fire Database (EFD) is employed to characterize the southern European wildfires \n\nresponses to blocking and ridges. The role played by preceding and immediate blocking/ridges in \n\nburnt areas is assessed separately by exploring both the pre-fire and the active (summer) fire \n\nseasons. Due to the pre-conditioning of soil moisture deficits in fire vulnerability, particular \n\nattention is paid to quantify the links between blocking/ridges and droughts by using the recently \n\ndeveloped Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). The spatial correlation \n\ncoefficients between droughts and atmospheric patterns (at different time scales) are also \n\nconsidered, in order to account for the feedbacks between winter-spring droughts and summer \n\ntemperature extremes. Finally, an overview of recent (1950-2012) trends in ridge frequency over \n\nthe Euro-Atlantic sector is performed, in order to explore potential difficulties in thresholds \n\ncalibration for the ridge detection in CMIP5 GCMs. \n\n \n\nResults \n\nBlocking/ridge patterns exert an important effect on wildfire spatial extension at different time \n\nscales. During the pre-fire wet season, reduced blocking (increased ridge) frequency is associated \n\nwith below average precipitation in southern Europe, thus promoting drought conditions and \n\nenhancing vegetation fire vulnerability in the following summer. Furthermore, during the fire \n\nseason itself, these atmospheric patterns, and in particular summer ridges, impinge hot and dry \n\nconditions, which foster fire spread. The solely occurrence of anomalous blocking/ridge activity \n\nin either the pre-fire or the active fire season is not enough to explain the large inter-annual \n\nvariability of burnt areas, and both conditions are required to account for the worst fire years in \n\ndifferent southern European countries.  \n\nIn the last decades, the frequency of sub-tropical ridges has increased in the Mediterranean areas. \n\nFuture warming climate projections suggest additional increases along with the northward \n\nexpansion of the sub-tropical high-pressure belt. However preliminary analyses reveal some \n\nlimitations of the detection method used for ridges implying  a clear need to develop new \n\ndynamical detection schemes, rather than methods purely based on anomaly fields, in order to \n\nincrease confidence in future projections of ridge frequencies.  \n\n\n\n5. Conclusions and open threads for Future work \n \n \n\n137 \n \n\n5.1 Conclusions \n \n\nThis thesis has addressed the seasonal impacts of atmospheric blocking in the Euro-Atlantic \n\nsector, with emphasis on regional and seasonal assessments that have often been overlooked in \n\nprevious studies. Thus, a thorough characterization of blocking occurrence within different \n\nlongitudinal sectors (Atlantic, European and Russian) was performed, prior to a comprehensive \n\nanalysis of the associated climatic impacts of each blocking pattern over Europe, considering in \n\nparticular the impacts on the precipitation and temperature distributions over distinct regional \n\nsectors. \n\nThe assessment of blocking impacts led to an important conclusion about the necessity to \n\ndistinguish the climatology and impacts of high-latitude blocking from those of sub-tropical ridges. \n\nIn this context, a novel ridge detection scheme was developed in Chapter 2, and a catalogue with \n\ntheir occurrence was computed, in order to compare it against the blocking catalogue. While ridges \n\nare frequent precursors of wave-breaking that may evolve into Omega-type blocks, or Rex-type \n\nblocks in a later stage, these lower latitude structures do not require a wave-breaking as blockings \n\ndo. More importantly, their dynamical structure, and the fact they are located further south, \n\nimpinge very contrasting (sometimes opposite) conditions over Europe, when compared to blocks.  \n\nChapter 2 highlights the necessity to distinguish the latitudinal location of geopotential height \n\nmaximum anomalies in order to assess their associated impacts on temperature (Sousa et al., \n\n2017b). In fact, this allowed to clarify that most summer extreme heat episodes in southern Europe \n\nand Mediterranean areas should not be attributed to blocking, but rather to ridges, contrarily to \n\nwhat previous studies had imprecisely stated. For central and northern areas of the continent, both \n\nregimes are responsible for warm episodes, as radiative heating and subsidence are enhanced under \n\nanomalously high geopotential values. Contrarily, during winter, the temperature impacts of \n\nblocking and ridges are opposite. While blocks (particularly those located in the eastern Atlantic \n\nand western/central Europe) favor cold winter spells by reinforcing the cold advection through the \n\nnortherly flows established in their eastern flank, winter ridge patterns are associated to above \n\naverage temperatures and mild Atlantic air masses induced by stronger zonal flows.    \n\nA similar dichotomy was applied to the evaluation of the blocking impacts on European \n\nprecipitation regimes in Chapter 3, by separating strong zonal flow and blocking regimes (Sousa \n\net al., 2017a). Blocking patterns are associated with a clear north-south dipole consisting in \n\nnegative (positive) precipitation anomalies in northern (southern) European areas. In the overall, \n\nthese precipitation responses are explained by a blocking-induced split of the storm-track around \n\nits center location, which enhances cyclonic activity in southern Europe. However, increased \n\natmospheric instability under such atmospheric configurations is additionally required to explain \n\nthe reported increase in heavy precipitation over Mediterranean areas. During strong zonal flows, \n\nthe precipitation anomaly pattern is essentially reversed, as compared to that of blocks. As ridges \n\nare associated with a stronger meridional pressure gradient north of their position (and a \n\nconsequent enhancement of the zonal flow at higher latitudes), the precipitation signatures of sub-\n\ntropical ridges are similar to those obtained for strong zonal flow patterns. Thus, an increased \n\n\n\n5. Conclusions and open threads for Future work \n \n \n\n138 \n \n\nfrequency of ridges leads to anomalously dry conditions in southern areas of the considered \n\nlongitudinal sector of occurrence, particularly during winter. Finally, the results also suggest that \n\nthe winter solid precipitation (snow covered soils) responses to blocking and ridges are better \n\nrelated to temperature than precipitation anomalies. Thus, while winter blocking occurrence leads \n\nto below average precipitation in large areas of central and northern Europe, the associated cold \n\ntemperature patterns are in good agreement with the above-average observed responses in snow \n\ncovered soil days over most European areas. On the opposite side, the mild winter conditions \n\nrelated to ridge occurrence inhibit snow cover in the European continent.   \n\nThe specific responses over the Iberian Peninsula were explored in Chapter 4 by using higher-\n\nresolution datasets (Sousa et al., 2016). The results reveal regional signatures that are missed in \n\ncoarser grids, particularly in what concerns the impact of topography in precipitation, hence \n\nconfirming the need of high-resolution to address the regional and local responses to weather \n\nregimes. Thus, while blocking (strong zonal flow) is associated with increased (reduced) \n\nprecipitation in most of Iberia, the northwestern tip of the Peninsula receives less (more) \n\nprecipitation, in agreement with a reduced (increased) cyclonic frequency at higher latitudes and \n\nthe resulting frontal activity that reaches this region. Blocking activity plays a crucial role on the \n\nprecipitation regimes and the occurrence of heavy precipitation events in the southern half and the \n\nMediterranean shores of Iberia. Regarding ridges, the results show that their impacts are more \n\nsensitive to the specific location of the sub-tropical ridge. In particular, ridges in the eastern \n\nAtlantic are strongly linked to the occurrence of dry and warm conditions over large parts of Iberia, \n\nthus leading to regional extreme summer temperature events. Furthermore, ridges located in the \n\n15W-15E sector are responsible for generalized winter dry conditions in Iberia, diminishing \n\nconsiderably the total annual rainfall observed in the area. \n\n \n\n5.2 Open threads for Future work \n\nThe characterization of the specific regional impacts of blocking patterns in primary \n\nclimatological variables, such as temperature and precipitation, provides an appropriate \n\nbackground for framing the impacts on other variables and on other background conditions (i.e., \n\nfuture climate). Some of these questions correspond to ongoing work, whose preliminary results \n\nwill be included in this section.  \n\n In particular, Section 5.2.1 is devoted to drought variability, which is strongly dependent on \n\nanomalous conditions in both temperature and precipitation. As such, the links between \n\nblocking/ridges and droughts can be framed taking into account the specific temperature (Chapter \n\n2) and precipitation (Chapter 3) anomaly patterns associated to each regime. The decisive role of \n\ndrought conditions in fire activity allows in turn an assessment of the possible impacts of blocking \n\nand ridges in wildfire inter-annual variability in southern European countries.  \n\nDroughts and wildfires are issues of special concern in the Mediterranean, which has been \n\nconsidered as a climate change hot-spot. Thus, finally, Section 5.2.2 provides an overview of \n\nrecent studies on observed trends and future changes in blocking. To our knowledge, there are not \n\n\n\n5. Conclusions and open threads for Future work \n \n \n\n139 \n \n\nsimilar assessments for sub-tropical ridges, and hence, a substantial part of this section will focus \n\non exploring recent trends in these systems. This will provide a first step to assess the projected \n\nchanges in their occurrence and in the associated impacts, as a way to understand the contribution \n\nof changes in these weather regimes to the projected drying and warming of the Mediterranean, \n\nand the resulting threats to water availability (see the future perspectives in Section 5.3). The links \n\nbetween fires, drought occurrence, atmospheric circulation and climate change acquire special \n\nrelevance in the Iberian Peninsula, which has been a central topic of this thesis. These questions \n\nwere addressed in two papers developed during the PhD. within the scope of the European project \n\nFUME (Sousa et al., 2015; Trigo et al., 2013b). While they are considered outside the main scope \n\nof this thesis, their information is relevant for the ongoing work and the future perspectives, and \n\nhence, they have been included in the Annex. \n\n \n\n5.2.1 The feedbacks between blocking, droughts and wildfires \n\nWildfire inter-annual and intra-annual variability in the Mediterranean area has been widely \n\nexplored in recent decades (e.g. Pereira et al., 2005; Gudmundsson et al., 2014; Turco et al., 2017). \n\nIt is well known that pre-conditioning (pre-fire season) may enhance vegetation stress, while the \n\nmeteorological conditions during the peak of the fire season are the main trigger for fire ignitions \n\n(Pereira et al. 2013; Trigo et al., 2013b; Sousa et al., 2015; Gouveia et al., 2016; Amraoui et al., \n\n2015). The links between climate and fire are often analyzed under the intermediate fire-\n\nproductivity hypothesis (Pausas and Bradstock, 2006; Pausas and Paula, 2012), which suggests \n\nthat fire risk oscillates between two minima, one dominated by high aridity conditions, under \n\nwhich fire spread is mostly limited by the fuel amount (Sousa et al., 2015a), and another \n\ncharacterized by low aridity, where fuels are abundant and fires are mainly limited by the soil \n\nmoisture content (Ruffault et al., 2016; Turco et al., 2017). In fuel-limited ecosystems, antecedent \n\nwet conditions may regulate the fuel amount and its structure, while in relatively wet ecosystems, \n\ndroughts and hot spells can influence dryness (Pausas and Paula, 2012).  \n\nOn the overall, in Mediterranean climates, the vulnerability to very large wildfires is well related \n\nwith drought occurrence (Gouveia et al., 2016). As water availability in most of these areas is \n\nhighly reliant on the rainfall amount accumulated during winter and spring, below average \n\nprecipitation in the wet season is often related with vegetation stress in the warmer months \n\n(Pellizzaro et al., 2007; Gouveia et al., 2012; Turco et al., 2017). However, wetter than average \n\nlate spring conditions following dry winters can trigger a rapid biomass growth in certain \n\nMediterranean areas, such as western Iberia, also enhancing forest vulnerability in the case of a \n\nfollowing dry and hot summer (Pereira et al., 2013). As such, Mediterranean-type climates can be \n\nconsidered \u201cintermediate\u201d ecosystems, where both soil moisture and fuel amount can play a role \n\nin shaping fire regimes (Pausas and Paula, 2012: Gudmunsson et al., 2014; Turco et al., 2017). \n\nIn this context, we explore the links between blocking/ridge occurrence and wildfires in several \n\nsouthern European countries, using the European Fire Database (EFD \u2013 Camia et al., 2014), a \n\ndatabase which assembles records for individual fire events from 21 countries of the European \n\nUnion. The fire database covers slightly varying periods for each country spanning between the \n\n\n\n5. Conclusions and open threads for Future work \n \n \n\n140 \n \n\nearly 1980s and early 2010s. These links should be considered for different time-lags and temporal \n\nscales, as these atmospheric patterns may play an important role in extreme summer temperature \n\nconditions (as shown in Chapter 2), as well as in soil moisture pre-conditioning (i.e., drought \n\nconditions). \n\nTo characterize drought conditions in Europe, the Standardized Precipitation Evaporation Index \n\n(SPEI) developed by Vicente-Serrano et al. (2010) was employed. This is a multiscalar drought \n\nindex based on climatic data (precipitation and temperature), which can be used for determining \n\nthe onset, duration and magnitude of drought with respect to normal conditions in a variety of \n\nnatural and managed systems such as crops, ecosystems, rivers, water resources, etc. It is available \n\non a monthly basis with a horizontal resolution of 0.5\u00ba x 0.5\u00ba, and for different time-scales, \n\nspanning between 1 and 24 months. Here, the 6-month time-scale was considered, thus the SPEI \n\nindex for May, at the end of spring (representing the accumulated hydrological imbalance through \n\nthe winter and spring) was compared against the anomalous occurrence of blocking and ridges in \n\nthe previous months. Figure 5.1 shows the correlation between the May SPEI for each gridpoint \n\nand the anomalous frequency of blocks/ridges during January-May in the three 30\u00ba longitudinal \n\nsectors. \n\n \n\n                      ATL       EUR RUS \n\nB\nlo\n\nc\nk\n\ns \n\n \n\n \n\nR\nid\n\ng\ne\ns \n\n \n \n\n \nFig. 5.1 Pearson correlation coefficient between 6-month SPEI at the end of spring (May) and the \n\nprevious month\u2019s anomaly (January-May) in the frequency of blocking (upper panel) and ridges (lower \n\npanel) occurring in the ATL (30W-0W), EUR (0E-30E) and RUS (30E-60E) sectors for the period \n\n1950-2012. \n\n \n\nThe correlation coefficients are in relative good agreement with the previously discussed \n\nprecipitation anomalies found for blocking (Section 3.1) and ridges (Section 3.3). The former \n\nimpinge a dry fingerprint in central and northern areas of Europe, and wetter than average \n\n\n\n5. Conclusions and open threads for Future work \n \n \n\n141 \n \n\nconditions in southern Europe, while the latter shows a reversed meridional dipole in SPEI. \n\nFocusing on southern European areas, ridges are the main precursor of drought conditions (and of \n\nthe subsequent incremented vegetation stress) in the pre-fire season (Fig. 5.1, lower panels). These \n\nlinks show the leading role of anomalous precipitation patterns during the colder and usually wetter \n\nmonths in modulating drought conditions towards late spring and early summer. This assessment \n\nonly accounts for the pre-conditioning of the large-scale circulation in the fire season vulnerability \n\n(i.e., the potential for severe summer wildfires). However, the actual fire activity is also dependent \n\non the occurrence of a following hot summer, which in turn can be also associated to concurrent \n\nanomalies in the frequency of blocking/ridges, as shown in Chapter 2.  \n\nTo further check this dual role of precedent and current atmospheric patterns in the fire season \n\nitself, correlation coefficients were also computed between summer burnt areas in southern \n\nEuropean countries (Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece) and: 1) the anomalous frequency of \n\nblocking/ridge patterns between January and May (the pre-fire season); 2) anomalous frequency \n\nof blocking/ridge patterns between June and September (the fire season). These results are shown \n\nin Tables 5.1 and 5.2, respectively. \n\n \n\nTable 5.1 Pearson correlation coefficient between summer burnt area (June to September) and the \n\nanomalous frequency of blocks/ridges in each sector prior to the fire season (January to May).

For example, a significant correlation \n\nis found between summer ATL ridges and fires in Portugal, as expected from the anomalous \n\ntemperature responses during such episodes (Section 2.1). However, in the overall, previous and \n\ncontemporary meteorological conditions alone do not explain a large fraction of the burnt area \n\nvariability. In this sense, and besides non-meteorological factors (such as land-use, fire prevention \n\nand suppression measures), it is possible to hypothesize that the role of the atmospheric circulation \n\n\n\n5. Conclusions and open threads for Future work \n \n \n\n142 \n \n\npatterns in wildfires will maximize when both the anomalous frequencies of weather regimes \n\nduring and before the fire season are considered simultaneously. This should help to explain a \n\ncumulative process which begins with winter and early spring atmospheric patterns promoting dry \n\nconditions, followed by summer synoptic conditions favoring regional warm temperatures, and \n\nthus fire ignitions. As a future work, this could be achieved by considering the conditional \n\nprobability of fire activity subject to: 1) blocking/ridges in the previous season alone; 2) \n\nblocking/ridges in the fire season itself; 3) blocking/ridges in both seasons. Such analysis would \n\nalso allow testing different combinations of weather regimes and seasons (e.g., less blocks in \n\nwinter-spring and more ridges in summer). \n\nIn this context, it is worth noticing that several authors have described the feedback between \n\nwinter-spring soil dryness in transitional climatic regions and the enhancement of European \n\nsummer heat episodes (e.g., Fischer et al. 2007; Vautard et al. 2007, Seneviratne et al., 2010). In \n\naddition, Quesada et al. (2012) reported that winter-spring dryness precedes European heatwaves \n\nonly if anticyclonic conditions occur in summer, thus stressing the key role of summer high-\n\npressure systems. As a consequence, one should expect an enhanced summer fire risk if both \n\nconditions (preceding soil moisture deficits and summer high-pressure anomalies) are \n\nsimultaneously met. To address this question, we computed the composites of late spring (May) \n\nSPEI and June-September Z500 anomalies for the most severe wildfire years (in terms of total \n\nburnt area) of each country (Fig. 5.2). \n\nP\no\n\nr\ntu\n\ng\na\n\nl \n\n \n \n\nIta\nly\n\n \nS\n\np\na\nin\n\n \n\n  \n\nG\nr\ne\ne\nc\ne\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 5.2 Composite of the 6-month SPEI at the end of spring (May, shading) and the following summer \n\n(June-September) 500 hPa geopotential height anomalies (black contours) for the 5 most severe years \n\nin terms of total burnt area.

Conclusions and open threads for Future work \n \n \n\n143 \n \n\nAs it can be seen, there is an overall spatial agreement between the affected countries (in terms \n\nof burnt area) and both late spring soil moisture deficits (SPEI) and positive summer Z500 \n\nanomalies, although with a number of regional nuances. Overall, it is reasonable to conclude that \n\nthe worst fire seasons were accompanied by both preceding droughts and concurrent anticyclonic \n\nconditions in summer. However, it is important to acknowledge that these spatial patterns do not \n\nalways occur over the considered country. For example, for the most severe fire years in Portugal, \n\nthe summer high-pressure conditions and the preceding dryness occur over a large area of western \n\nand southwestern Europe. This may be explained by the findings of Vautard et al. (2007), who \n\nreported that winter soil moisture deficits in southern Europe tend to propagate towards central \n\nEurope throughout the following spring and summer. To check this hypothesis, we computed the \n\ncomposited monthly evolution of the SPEI index for the same set of severe years of each country \n\n(Fig. 5.3). \n\n February May August \n\nP\no\nr\ntu\n\ng\na\nl \n\n   \n\nS\np\n\na\nin\n\n \n\n   \n\nIt\na\nly\n\n \n\n   \n\nG\nr\ne\ne\nc\ne\n \n\n   \n \n\n \n\nFig. 5.3 Composites of the intra-annual evolution of the 6-month SPEI for the 5 most severe years in \n\nterms of total burnt area in each considered country. Period considered for each country as stated in \n\nTable 5.1. \n\nPortuguese wildfires (top panel, Figure 5.3) depict very well the previously described northward \n\nexpansion of drought conditions along the western sectors of Europe from winter to summer. \n\n\n\n5. Conclusions and open threads for Future work \n \n \n\n144 \n \n\nHowever, it should be stressed that the outstanding 2003 year (in terms of heatwaves and wildfire \n\noccurrence) could induce biases in the composite due to its outlier nature. In the remaining cases, \n\nthe pattern does not show such a northward expansion, but a localized aggravation of the drought \n\nconditions throughout late spring and summer. In all the cases, the SPEI anomalies are observed \n\nsince spring, being collocated with the following summer Z500 anomalies shown in Fig. 5.2. These \n\nresults suggest a possible feedback of the drought conditions on the atmospheric circulation (e.g., \n\nFischer and Sch\u00e4r 2009), highlighting the need for further investigation of this soil-atmosphere \n\ncoupling. In summary, while an anomalous occurrence of blocking/ridges before and during the \n\nfire season influences fire vulnerability in southern Europe, they are not necessarily a sufficient \n\ncondition. In most cases, a winter-spring soil moisture deficit pre-conditioning (strongly linked \n\nwith reduced blocking and/or enhanced ridges) and the occurrence of summer ridges are both \n\nrequired to trigger wildfires. While these results may provide some prospects on developing useful \n\nseasonal predictions of wildfire occurrence, particular caution must be taken concerning their \n\nrepresentativeness due to the exploratory nature of this work.     \n\n \n\n5.2.2 Future scenarios of blocking variability in the 21st century \n\nIn recent decades, General Circulation Models (GCM) have improved their capacity to reproduce \n\nglobal and regional climate variability (Flato et al., 2013), as well as observed meteorological \n\nfields, with ever increasing skill scores under weather forecast mode (Magnussen and K\u00e4llen. \n\n2013). However, their relatively weak ability to reproduce the inception and duration of blocking \n\npatterns has been an undermining caveat through different generations of GCMs (D\u2019Andrea et al., \n\n1998; Scaife et al. 2010; Davini and D\u2019Andrea, 2016). Taking into account the crucial impact of \n\natmospheric blocking in the European climate, a good representation of its phenomenology in \n\nGCMs is required in order to increase confidence in future projections (Hoskins, 2013). The \n\nblocking underrepresentation in GCMs is particularly pronounced in the Euro-Atlantic sector, with \n\ndifferent definitions and detection methods (e.g. anomalies versus flow reversal) being able to \n\nprovide different quantitative results (e.g., Barriopedro et al. 2010b). In addition, Scaife et al. \n\n(2010) or Vial and Osborn (2012) attributed a large proportion of the diagnosed blocking errors to \n\nbiases in the mean climate, particularly in the meridional gradient of the geopotential height fields. \n\nMore recently, Davini and D\u2019Andrea (2016) made a thorough inter-comparison between \n\ngenerations of models in the last 20 years. These authors show that, despite an overall improvement \n\nin GCMs, few advances have been made in blocking representation in the Euro-Atlantic sector. \n\nThis latter work also corroborates findings from other authors (e.g. Berckmans et al. 2013, \n\nMatsueda et al., 2009; Anstey et al., 2013), which show that high-resolution models reduce the \n\nunderestimation of blocking frequency, with the increase in the horizontal and vertical resolutions \n\nboth playing an important role. Also recently, Pithan et al. (2016) suggested that the representation \n\nof large scale features such as jet-streams, blockings or storm-tracks can be improved by refining \n\nparameterizations of low-level drag.  \n\nConcerning future projections, and despite a number of discrepancies, there is some agreement \n\non a decreasing trend of blocking frequency in the North Atlantic under increasing Greenhouse \n\nGases Concentrations (e.g., Barnes et al. 2012; Dunn-Sigouin and Son, 2013), accompanied by a \n\n\n\n5. Conclusions and open threads for Future work \n \n \n\n145 \n \n\nsmall increase in central/eastern Europe and western Russia, suggesting a northeastward migration \n\nof blocking patterns (e.g. Sillman et al., 2009; de Vries et al., 2013). Other authors report an \n\nincrease in prolonged blocks in the eastern Atlantic, particularly during winter (e.g. Mokhov et al. \n\n2014). In agreement with these authors, Ruti et al. (2014) reported an association between longer \n\nblocking episodes and anthropogenic forcing. \n\nConversely, there have been no exhaustive studies regarding the projected changes in sub-\n\ntropical ridges, at least for the Euro-Atlantic sector. Kent et al. (2011) examined the representation \n\nof the Australian sub-tropical ridge in CMIP3 models, and projected an increase in its intensity in \n\nthe 21st century, with an extension of its influence towards higher latitudes, thus aggravating \n\ndrought episodes in the area. These results are in agreement with the overall positive projected \n\ntrends in geopotential heights at such latitudes associated to the expansion of the Hadley cell (Lu \n\net al., 2007). \n\nBefore exploring future changes, we analyze recent trends in the frequencies of sub-tropical \n\nridges and high-latitude blocking over the Euro-Atlantic sector during the observational record. In \n\nFigs. 5.4 and 5.5, the time series of blocks and ridges frequencies occurring in each of the three \n\nconsidered longitudinal sectors (ATL, EUR and RUS) and the associated linear trends are depicted. \n\nThis analysis was undertaken for the calibration period (1950.2012) and using the NCEP/NCAR \n\nreanalysis. \n\n \n\nFig. 5.4 Winter time series of blocking (upper panel) and ridge (lower panel) frequencies of occurrence \n\nin the ATL (30W-0W), EUR (0E-30E) and RUS (30E-60E) sectors, for the period 1950-2012. \n\n \n\n\n\n5. Conclusions and open threads for Future work \n \n \n\n146 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 5.5 Same as Fig. 5.4, but for summer. \n\n \n\nThe analysis suggests a marked increase in the frequency of sub-tropical ridges in all sectors \n\nthroughout the reference period (1950-2012). On the contrary, blocking frequencies have remained \n\nrelatively stable, with only a slight decreasing frequency in winter EUR blocks (Fig. 5.4, upper \n\npanel, red line). This indicates more frequent and persistent northwards extensions of the sub-\n\ntropical high pressure belt, in good agreement with the aforementioned projections for the 21st \n\ncentury. Taking into account the temperature and precipitation impacts of ridges presented in \n\nChapters 2 and 3, these results suggest a potential link between the warming and drying \n\nMediterranean climate in the turning of the 20th century and the more frequent occurrence of ridge \n\npatterns. \n\nIn order to obtain a preliminary insight into future projections of sub-tropical ridges, a set of \n\nGCMs from the CMIP5 project (which are frequently referenced in recent literature) was used \n\n(BCC, CanESM2, EC-Earth, GFDL, IPSL, MPI, MRI and NorESM1), considering the RCP4.5 \n\nand RCP8.5 emission scenarios. As stated in Chapter 1, the analysis of future projections using \n\nanomaly-based detection methods is hampered by the definition of a baseline period and a \n\nthreshold criterion, due to the presence of a constantly changing climatology (e.g., Barriopedro et \n\nal. 2010b). In order to quantify this potential effect, the 30-year running evolution of the Z500 \n\nmedian and the 80th percentile was computed in all boxes considered for the ridge detection (see \n\nSection 2.3). Figs. 5.6 and 5.7 show these changes between 1950 and 2100, for winter and summer, \n\nrespectively. \n\n\n\n5. Conclusions and open threads for Future work \n \n \n\n147 \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFig. 5.6 Z500 median (upper panel) and 80th percentile (lower panel) in the southern (upper lines) and \n\nnorthern (lower lines) boxes defined for ridge detection in the ATL (blue), EUR (red) and RUS (green) \n\nsectors. Thick lines represent the mean of all models and scenarios, while thin dashed lines represent \n\nthe RCP8.5 (upper dashed lines) and RCP4.5 (lower dashed lines) separately. The thick dashed black \n\nlines left of the vertical line represent the values for the 1950-2012 period of the NCEP/NCAR \n\nreanalysis dataset. \n\n \n\nThe results indicate steady positive trends for both boxes throughout the entire period and for all \n\nscenarios. Summer increases (Fig. 5.7) in the median and 80th percentiles of Z500 are more \n\nmarked, especially in the last decades of the 21st century and for the southern boxes, where ridges \n\nare detected. Winter changes (Fig. 5.6) are smaller, but once again larger for the 80th percentile \n\nthan for the median. The Z500 increases at lower latitudes are in agreement with the northward \n\nexpansion of the sub-tropical high pressure belt expected in a warming climate (Lu et al., 2007). \n\nIn spite of this, from a dynamical perspective, the generalized Z500 increases do not necessarily \n\ninvolve a rise in the frequency of ridges or blocks. In fact, as mentioned before, blocking structures \n\ndetected using a flow-reversal scheme actually show future declining trends. As far as ridges\u2019 \n\ndetection is concerned, and considering that the approach based purely on anomalies does not \n\nrequire a wave-breaking, the projected changes in Z500 may relate to: 1) a generalized northward \n\nmigration of the sub-tropical high pressure belt and/or; 2) an actual increase in the number of ridge \n\nstructures.  \n\n \n\n\n\n5. Conclusions and open threads for Future work \n \n \n\n148 \n \n\n \n\n \nFig. 5.7 Same as Fig. 5.6 but for summer. \n\n \n\nTaking into account the non-dynamical nature of our approach, this disentanglement cannot be \n\nachieved in such a framework. In order to deal with these Z500 trends, one may consider time-\n\nvarying thresholds in the ridge detection scheme by using moving reference climatological periods \n\n(as shown in Figs. 5.6 and 5.7). However, the results of this approach do not reveal consistent \n\ntrends in the frequencies/locations of ridges (not shown) among the considered models, neither \n\nbetween scenarios or different sectors. Furthermore, a similar approach, but considering a fixed \n\nthreshold (1950-2012) for ridge detection, resulted in exaggerated increases by the late 21st century \n\n(above 70%). In this sense, we conclude that at least from an anomaly-based detection scheme, no \n\nfurther considerations about future projections of ridges may be made with confidence. Thus, there \n\nis a need for a dynamical approach in the ridge detection, such as latitudinal/longitudinal Z500 \n\ngradients (similar to those developed for blocking detection) in order to consider future projections \n\nwith a higher level of reliability. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n5. Conclusions and open threads for Future work \n \n \n\n149 \n \n\n5.3 Perspectives \n\nThe estimation of uncertainties in decadal predictability and long-term future climate projections \n\nhas been widely debated in the literature, particularly at the regional scale. Natural climate \n\nvariability imposes inherent limitations to climate predictability and consequently to adaptation \n\nguidance (Deser et al., 2012). In this context, Shepherd (2014) stresses the distinct roles played by \n\nthermodynamic and dynamical changes in future climate projections. Whereas the confidence in \n\nchanges controlled by thermodynamics is high, the same is not valid for circulation dynamics, \n\nwhich exert a strong control on regional climates. As a consequence, projections of meteorological \n\nfields that are strongly dependent on atmospheric circulation (e.g., precipitation) display large \n\nspread, as a consequence of different types of uncertainty (model, scenario, internal variability). \n\nLow-frequency internal variability and the sensitivity of the circulation response to model errors \n\nand climatic forcings are the main sources of uncertainty. The work by Horton et al. (2015) \n\nindicates that even though a significant portion of the observed changes in extreme temperatures \n\nresults from regional and global-scale thermodynamic changes, changes in the frequency, \n\npersistence and duration of regional circulation patterns, including European blocking, acquire \n\nhigh relevance to explain recent changes at regional scales. Also, the rapid warming of the Arctic \n\nregion (twice as fast as the global average) is happening at a pace greater than that simulated by \n\nclimate models. The possible link between this Arctic amplification and an increase of extreme \n\nmid-latitude weather events (including both cold winters and summer heatwaves), as discussed by \n\nCohen et al. (2014) and Comou et al. (2015), stresses the need to better understand the dynamical \n\nresponses to changes in the external forcings. \n\nIn the context of the uncertainties associated with the large-scale dynamic component, a large \n\neffort was devoted in this work to disentangle blocking from ridge phenomena, as this will be \n\nincreasingly necessary for modelling purposes. As a consequence, the analysis of future \n\nprojections of both weather regimes, and the associated changes in their impacts, constitute one of \n\nthe most immediate applications of the future work. Since the method developed for ridge \n\ndetection is purely based on anomaly fields, it is necessary to acknowledge its limitation to \n\ninterpret future changes from GCM projections. On the other hand, we are aware that blocking and \n\nridge life cycles are not at all detached. In fact, and as described in Chapter 1, they often represent \n\ndifferent stages of the life cycle of planetary wave-breaking occurrence. As such, the prospect of \n\ncombining blocking and ridge detection schemes into a more unified algorithm capable of \n\ndescribing such life cycles constitutes a major line of future work, directly related with the \n\nachievements of this thesis. \n\nIn another context, and taking into account the substantial blocking impacts reported in this thesis, \n\nthe exploration of the blocking responses to external forcings represents a very tangible topic of \n\ninterest. Various authors have reported links between blocking and remote oceanic patterns (e.g., \n\nENSO; http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/blocking/enso/enso_stratification.shtml), \n\ndecadal modes of oceanic variability (e.g., Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation; Martinez, 2014) and \n\nother external forcings (e.g., solar forcing; Barriopedro et al. 2008). Thus, a deeper knowledge of \n\nsuch links could represent a huge step in terms of seasonal-to-decadal predictability in extratropical \n\nlatitudes. \n\n\n\n5.

Wildfires  are  the  cause  of  major  ecological\nand economic  impacts  in  this  region,  and  the increasing  evidence  of climate  change  consequences  in\nthis  region  raises  concerns  on  the  future  impacts  of fires  in  the  Iberian  forests  ecosystems.  Our  results\nconfirm  that  the  inter-annual  variability  of  total  burnt  area  is mainly  controlled  by  meteorological  condi-\ntions, in  spite  of the  current  efforts  for fire  control  and  suppression.  We  also  show  that  this  meteorology\ndominance  over  fire  activity  is not  only  true  during  the  fire season  itself,  but  also  that  certain  specific  mete-\norological  backgrounds  (such  as prolonged  droughts)  may  enhance  the risk  for  severe  wildfire  episodes  in\nsome areas.  Based  on  a previous  classification  of  the  Iberian  Peninsula  into  four  distinct  pyro-regions,  we\ndeveloped  statistical  models  which  reproduce  about  two  thirds  of the  inter-annual  variability  of  the burnt\narea,  using  meteorological  variables  as  predictors  (calibrated  with  data from  the  ERA-Interim  reanaly-\nsis).  Specific  models  were  developed  for each  sub-domain,  testing  their  robustness  for  extrapolation\nunder  climate-change  conditions.  Using  an  ensemble  of  state-of-the-art  RCM  future  climate  scenarios,\nwe  present  future  BA  projections  considering  two  alternative  techniques  of  statistical  correction  of model\ndata often  used  in  climate  change  impact  studies:  (1) unbiasing  method;  (2)  delta  change  method.  Our\n\nresults  clearly  project  large  increases  in  mean  burnt  areas  for  all  the considered  pyro-regions,  despite\nsome fluctuations  regarding  each  considered  technique.  By  2075, mean  burnt  areas  could  be about  two\nto three  times  larger  than  in  the  present,  taking  into  account  current  climate  projections  for  the  next\ncentury,  and  non-significant  changes  in  other  external  factors,  such  as  human  activity,  fire  suppression\nor  land  use.\n\n\u00a9 2014  Elsevier  B.V.

Introduction\n\nWildfires are not a recent hazard in the Iberian Peninsula;\nevertheless, it is unquestionable that some of the most dramatic\npisodes have occurred since the turning of the century, partic-\nlarly in western Iberia. The years of 2003 and 2005 correspond\n\no landmark fire seasons in the fire history of Portugal, being\nesponsible for the highest values of burnt area (hereafter, BA)\nince 1980 (Trigo et al., 2006; Pereira et al., 2011).

It is well known the\nimportant human role on the shaping of fuel availability, which\nhas a great impact in fire activity in Mediterranean ecosystems\n(de la Cueva et al., 2006; Costa et al., 2010; Pausas and Fern\u00e1ndez-\nMun?oz, 2012). Some Iberian fire prone areas, such as the eastern\ncoast of Spain (e.g. Valencia, Murcia, Catalonia) have witnessed a\nsignificant decrease of summer wildfire since the mid-90s, partly\nattributable to significant improvements in fire prevention and\nsuppression schemes (Turco et al., 2013), taken after some of the\n\nworst fire occurrences in the region.\n\nNonetheless, apart from the anthropogenic influence and in\nspite of the fire suppression efforts in the Euro-Mediterranean\nareas, meteorological drivers play a key role in modulating the\n\ndx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2014.11.018\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01681923\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/agrformet\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1016/j.agrformet.2014.11.018&amp;domain=pdf\nmailto:ppsousa@fc.ul.pt\ndx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2014.11.018\n\n\n1  Fores\n\ni\nc\n2\n(\na\na\ne\ns\nt\ns\nr\no\nt\nh\ne\ni\nr\n(\nt\no\nf\n\no\nm\nR\n2\nfi\ni\nm\nl\nd\nA\na\ne\n2\ni\na\n\na\ni\nb\ne\ne\nu\na\nc\nB\nr\np\nc\np\nd\nm\nt\nj\ns\ns\nn\nO\nt\nd\nt\nv\nt\nr\nb\n\n2 P.M. Sousa et al. / Agricultural and\n\nnter-annual variability of BA (Bedia et al., 2014), which is strongly\nontrolled by summer meteorological conditions (Pereira et al.,\n005; Trigo et al., 2006, 2013), specially during drought episodes\nPausas and Fern\u00e1ndez-Mun?oz, 2012; Gouveia et al., 2012), and to\n\n lesser extent by previous precipitation, as antecedent conditions\nffect primary productivity (and hence fuel availability, Koutsias\nt al., 2013). In this regard, the recent work by Trigo et al. (2013)\nhows that this variability can be fairly well reproduced by sta-\nistical models based solely on meteorological variables. Despite\nignificant and costly efforts in prevention and suppression made in\necent years by national authorities, the recent rise in the frequency\nf extreme hot events (Ramos et al., 2011) and drought episodes in\nhe Iberian area (Garc\u00eda-Herrera et al., 2007; Sousa et al., 2011),\nas made its toll in scarring Iberian forests, as for instance, during\npisodes such as the mega-heatwave that affected western Europe\nn 2003 (Trigo et al., 2006; Garc\u00eda-Herrera et al., 2010), most often\nelated with the occurrence of large atmospheric blocking episodes\nTrigo et al., 2005; Barriopedro et al., 2011). Such episodes lead\no extremely dry atmospheric conditions that favor fire ignitions\nver a vegetation under hydric/hydrological stress and very low\nuel moisture content.\n\nThe strong meteorological forcing over fire regimes raises seri-\nus concerns on the future of the Mediterranean basin forests, as\nost Global and Regional Climate Models (hereafter GCMs and\n\nCMs) project an important warming in these areas (Brands et al.,\n011, Ramos et al., 2011; Frias et al., 2012) leading to an increased\nre danger potential (Bedia et al., 2013, 2014). Significant changes\n\nn precipitation regimes should also be expected, mainly in monthly\nean precipitation and intra-annual variability, characterized by\n\ness precipitation outside the winter season, as well as a ten-\nency toward more extreme events (Giorgi and Lionello, 2008;\nrg\u00fceso et al., 2012). To address this issue, several authors have\nttempted to explicitly model future BA series based on differ-\nnt climate change scenarios (Carvalho et al., 2007; Pereira et al.,\n013; Amatulli et al., 2013). Regardless of the method used and the\n\nnherent model uncertainties, all approaches consistently point to\n much higher future BA.\n\nIt is widely recognized that RCM outputs cannot be directly\npplied in impact studies due to the biases inherited from the driv-\nng GCM (see e.g. Turco et al., 2013b), as well as those introduced\ny the regional climate model (RCM) as a result of different model\nrrors and parameterizations (c.f., Christensen et al., 2008; Herrera\nt al., 2010). Thus, a validation/calibration process is needed before\nsing this data in impact applications. This process requires the\nvailability of historical data (or high-resolution reanalysis) to\nalibrate the model outputs in a particular region of interest.\nesides, climate models present some difficulties in realistically\nepresenting intrinsic variability, a fact which may  hamper future\nrojections, especially for those variables in which daily scale pro-\nesses are dominant. Different bias correction methods have been\nroposed and tested in the literature to adjust model biases and/or\naily variability using observations, being the unbiasing and delta\nethods (D\u00e9qu\u00e9, 2007) the most simple and popular ones. On\n\nhe one hand, the unbiasing method (hereafter BC) operates by\nust modifying the mean magnitude of the future simulation by\nubtracting the difference of the control simulation and the corre-\nponding control observations (generally on a monthly basis), thus\not affecting the distributional properties of the simulated series.\nn the other hand, the delta change method (henceforth DCM) uses\n\nhe control (daily) observations of the target variables as the future\naily baseline, adapting their mean state and variance according to\nhe projected (monthly) model changes, thus preserving the daily\n\nariability associated to the observed meteorological variables. This\nechnique has been previously applied in the context of wildfire\nesearch (Flannigan et al., 2013) although comparative studies of\noth approaches in the framework of wildfire research are lacking\nt Meteorology 202 (2015) 11\u201325\n\nto date. In this study, we investigate both types of model correction\ntechniques for the estimation of future BA in the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nThe aim of this study is the generation of plausible future BA sce-\nnarios for the Iberian Peninsula in order to ascertain the potential\nimpacts of climate change on wildfires. To this aim, the following\nsteps are addressed:\n\n(1) We  analyze the relationships between inter-annual variabil-\nity of observed BA and meteorological conditions, in particular\nthe meteorological patterns associated with intense wildfire\nseasons;\n\n(2) We  develop statistical regression models capable to reproduce\nthe inter-annual variability of BA series during the 1981\u20132005\ncontrol period, testing them with control simulation data from\na set of state-of-the-art RCMs from the EU-funded project\nENSEMBLES (van der Linden and Mitchell, 2009).\n\n(3) We  assess the uncertainty of the future projections derived\nfrom the bias correction technique by comparing the projected\nBA results after using either BC or DCM methods.\n\nThe manuscript is structured as follows:\nThe datasets and methodologies used are presented in Sec-\n\ntion 2 while an outlook at the control period fire climatology of\nIberia and of each sub-domain is performed in Section 3. The links\nwith meteorology, the development of the statistical model using\nobserved data, the performance of RCMs simulations for the control\nperiod and the projected future scenarios are presented in Section\n4. Finally, the discussion of the obtained results and used methods\nare found in Section 5.\n\n2. Data and methods\n\n2.1. Fire data\n\nPortuguese fire data was obtained from the Autoridade Flore-\nstal Nacional (Pereira et al., 2011), while Spanish data was  obtained\nfrom the Direcci\u00f3n General de Biodiversidad (M\u00e9rida et al., 2007).\nBuilding on both databases, we used the recent joint Iberian wildfire\ndatabase (Trigo et al., 2013), encompassing their common period\n1981\u20132005. Monthly BA time series are spatially disaggregated by\n(66) Continental administrative regions (hereafter AR), that cor-\nrespond to (18) Distritos in Portugal, and (48) Provincias in Spain\n- (excluding the Atlantic archipelagos). We  also computed the\nmonthly Normalized Burnt Area (NBA) for each AR, defined as the\nquotient between the amount of BA in each AR and the correspond-\ning area of the AR (Fig. 1).\n\nDespite the important inter-annual variability, the northwest-\nern sector of Iberia presents the highest rates of NBA in most years.\nYears 1981, 1985, 1989, 1995 and specially 2005 stand out as par-\nticularly severe in this sector, with annual NBA above 25\u2030 for a\nlarge number of AR. On the other hand, the years of 1991, 1995,\n2003 and 2004 were particularly harsh in southwestern regions\nof the Peninsula. The Mediterranean area is also prone to some\ndramatic wildfire summers, namely before 1995. In contrast with\nother regions where summer fires explain most of the annual NBA,\na well defined late winter or early spring fire season is found in the\nnorthernmost areas of Iberia (with similar magnitude compared to\nsummer months), as shown in Fig. 2. In fact, this earlier peak is\nalso found in northwest Iberia, but in this case, much smaller in\nmagnitude when compared to the mean summer NBA. These dif-\n\nferent fire regimes have also been addressed in a preceding work\n(Trigo et al., 2013), where a cluster analysis allowed the identifica-\ntion of four spatially homogeneous pyro-regions (Fig. 2): northwest\n(NW CLU), southwest (SW CLU), north (N CLU) and east (E CLU).\n\n\n\nP.M.

Given the high\number of variables and time resolution (6-hourly) of the reanaly-\nis data, we applied a pre-selection procedure based on correlation\nnalysis between time series of BA and meteorological variables,\ndentifying 12UTC 2m air temperature (hereafter, T), 12UTC 500 hPa\neopotential height (hereafter, Z) and daily precipitation (hereafter,\n) as the preferred candidate predictors. Mean sea level pressure\nhereafter, MSLP) series were also considered, but only for drawing\nynoptic charts.\n\n.3. Future climate projections\n\nWe  used the RCM simulations of the ENSEMBLES project (van\ner Linden and Mitchell, 2009). From all available models, we\nelected a subset of four RCMs (Table 1) which presented satisfying\nesults in the objective evaluation procedure of the RCM perfor-\nance over Portugal and Spain (Soares et al., 2012; Herrera et al.,\n\n010). The RCM simulations cover for a control period (1981\u20132001)\nnd the future scenario simulations extend until 2100 in most\nases, with a horizontal spatial resolution of about 25 km (Chris-\nensen et al., 2010). Since the ERA-Interim training period spans\nrom 1981 to 2005, and in order to obtain verification series with\nhe same length for each RCM, forcing data from the A1B scenar-\nos was used during the last four years, completing the small gap\nor 2002\u20132005. These simulations for the control period were used\nrstly to compare the performance of RCMs against ERA-Interim\n\nn modeling past BA series, and secondly to calibrate the statisti-\nal models before using them to project future scenarios of BA.  In\nhis study, we have considered the future time slices 2001\u20132025,\n026\u20132050 and 2051\u20132075.\n\n.4. Forward stepwise regression models\n\nFrom the pre-selected pool of potential predictors (see Section\n.2), a forward stepwise regression analysis was performed in order\no reproduce BA values for each cluster. This method tests all pos-\nible predictors, maintaining those that explain more variance of\nhe predictand (BA) time series, following a standard procedure in\ntmospheric sciences (Wilks, 2011). During this process, the algo-\nithm tests all combinations of predictors in order to exclude the\nedundant ones, thus avoiding the problem of multicollinearity\nAlin, 2010; Garg and Tai, 2012; Kraha et al., 2012), which may\namper model interpretability.\n\nThe robustness of the statistical models was tested by perform-\nng a 5-fold cross-validation scheme to each cluster\u2019s model (c.f.,\nupplementary Material \u2013 S1). This validation is crucial as non-\nobust models can be highly biased by outliers and, therefore, an\nverestimation on the performance metrics would exist. An addi-\nional precautionary step was taken forcing all models to retain\n\n predictors at most (the most correlated with BA amongst the\nredictors chosen by the forward stepwise regression). These two\nrecautions were taken since the time series are only 25 years\n\nong (1981\u20132005), and short training series carry the danger of\nverfitting when too many predictors are considered in the model\nHurvich and Tsai, 1989; Hawkins, 2004).\n\nIn addition, BA series in E CLU are not homogeneous, presenting\nigher values prior to the early 1990s with a peak-point in the year\n994, and decreasing significantly afterwards (Fig. 3. See also Turco\nt al., 2013), thus requiring the application of a correction factor\naking into account the two periods separately (discussed in Section\n\n.2).\n\nIn order to check model performance, we used four measures\nf goodness of fit (Wilks, 2011), namely the mean absolute error\nMAE), the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (?sp), the adjusted\nt Meteorology 202 (2015) 11\u201325\n\nexplained variance (r?2), and the skill score against the climatology\n(SS),  being the latter two  metrics given by Eqs. (1) and (2):\n\nr?2 = 1 ? n ? 1\nn ? (k + 1) (1 ? r\n\n2) (1)\n\nSS =\nRMSE ? RMSEref\n\nRMSEperf ? RMSEref\n\u00d7 100 (2)\n\nwhere n is the sample size, k is the number of predictors and r\nis the Pearson correlation coefficient. RMSEref is the root mean\nsquare error of the climatology series \u2013 a perfect model would have\nRMSEperf equal to 0.\n\nFinally, the robustness assessment undertaken also seeks to\nascertain if the linear models developed can be confidently applied\nfor extrapolation, at least under \u201cmoderate\u201d climate change (warm-\ning) conditions. The approach is described in detail in Guti\u00e9rrez\net al. (2012), and it is essentially based on working with anomalous\nwarm historical periods as proxies of future climate change condi-\ntions in order to test the ability of the models to reproduce warmer\nperiods outside the learning space of the model. More specifically,\nthe warm period is taken out from the training data and used to\ntest the resulting model (c.f., Supplementary Material S1).\n\n2.5. RCM data biases and distributions\n\nIt is widely recognized nowadays that, despite the improved\nconfidence in regional climate model simulations (Herrera et al.,\n2010; Maule et al., 2013; Ehret et al., 2012; Teutschbein and Seibert,\n2012), RCMs still reveal some limitations when attempting to rep-\nresent present climate (e.g. biases and unreliable variances). In\norder to understand the ability of each chosen RCM to reproduce\nthe present climate in the Iberian domain, a series of procedures\nwere applied and some statistical metrics were computed, for each\npyro-region of the Iberian Peninsula, and for different model out-\nput correction methods. In particular, two different simple bias\ncorrection techniques have been considered (the unbiasing and\ndelta change methods, BC and DCM, respectively; D\u00e9qu\u00e9, 2007) as\ndetailed in the following sections.\n\n2.5.1. The unbiasing method\nThe simplest bias correction procedures consist in removing\n\nthe difference between the means and the ratio of the variabil-\nity between observed and simulated time series obtained for the\nreference period (Huntingford et al., 2006; Ines and Hansen, 2006).\nHowever, this approach has several caveats: (1) corrections in the\nvariability will only work well for variables with Gaussian distri-\nbutions (e.g. temperature, geopotential height) and not for heavily\ntailed distributions (e.g. precipitation); (2) the intrinsic daily vari-\nability of each RCM will be kept, meaning that although means and\nstandard deviations can be controlled, poor reproductions of the\nobserved daily variability will subsist using this method.\n\nNevertheless, because this is the most widely used approach\nadopted by modelers we decided to maintain this simple bias cor-\nrection as a benchmark correction procedure. Taking into account\nthese factors, the following BC was  applied to the pre-selected\nvariables (as referred in Section 2.1) to obtain future series of tem-\nperature (3), geopotential height (4) and precipitation (5):\n\nTunbiased(t,m) = TRCMfut(t,m) +\n(\n\nTERActl(m) ?

The delta change method\nIn our statistical models the most important predictors are sam-\n\nled at daily scale, and therefore the poor representation of daily\nariability using the traditional bias correction may  hamper the\nesulting BA models. To overcome this drawback, the DCM has\neen used in recent years to simulate future meteorological time\neries based on RCM outputs when the daily variability is of crucial\nmportance (e.g. Hawkins et al., 2013; Ruiter, 2012). The main dis-\ninction in this approach consists in correcting observed time series\nn order to adjust them to expected forthcoming changes, rather\nhan correcting raw RCM output series. This process enables the\n\nonstruction of future time series which preserve observed daily\nariability. Naturally, this approach does not address significant\nhanges in the nature of the daily variability regimes, but still, both\nean and variability can be adjusted to obtain the future series.\n\nig. 3.

[2001]\n\nOnce again, changes in the mean are easy to obtain while changes\nin the standard deviations are only simple to perform with near\nGaussian distributions.

To address this issue, rather than trying to correct the\ntandard deviations of such a non-Gaussian distribution we opted\no correct the number of dry days. For that purpose, we first calcu-\nated the ratio of future change of dry days for each month in each\nCM, and corrected the expected number of future dry days in each\npecific month:\n\nRYdelta(m) = DRYERActl(m) \u00d7\n(\n\n\u00afDRYRCMfut(m)/DRYRCMctl(m)\n)\n\n(9)\n\nOnce more, all subscripts meaning is the same as in the previ-\nus equations. The difference between the expected and observed\number of dry days in each particular month (D) corresponds to the\number of lowest precipitation days in each month that is forced to\nave zero precipitation, in order to obtain the expected number of\nry days estimate in each month from (9). Naturally this forcing will\nhange the total precipitation of the month, resulting in this value\neing slightly above (below) the expected in the case of removing\nadding) dry days to the original series. This excess (lack) of precip-\ntation is then equally distributed (removed) from the remaining\nainy days of the month. The resulting series will permit to have\nonthly climatologies that present the mean and number of dry\n\nays, as expected from (8) and (9).\n\n.5.3. The observed-simulated distributions comparison\nModel biases for each meteorological variable, month and spa-\n\nial sub-domain were verified and removed from the series for the\nontrol period (1981\u20132005). Then, distributions of BA simulated\nsing ERA-Interim data and RCM outputs were compared with the\nistribution of observed BA series for the control period, in order to\n\ndentify which RCM models simulate better the present fire clima-\nology and may  provide greater confidence when simulating BA for\nuture scenarios.\n\nTo compare the similarity between time series of meteoro-\nogical variables or BA from two different models or sources, we\nheck the agreement between their probability distributions, to\nccount for differences in the mean and in higher order moments.\nwo skill scores were used for this purpose: the two-sample\nolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test (KSstatistic) and the PDFscore (Brands et al.,\n012).\n\nThe KSstatistic is a non-parametric test used to check the null\nypothesis that two separate samples come from the same the-\nretical distribution. The KSstatistic is defined as follows:\n\nSstat =\n2n\n\nmax\n\ni = 1\n\n??F (zi) ? G(zi)\n?? (10)\n\nwhere n is the length of the time-series, F and G are the empir-\ncal cumulative frequencies of each time-series, and zi denotes the\nth data value of the sorted joined sample. The KSstatistic is bounded\netween 0 and 1, and high distributional similarity is indicated by\n\now values. Serial autocorrelation must be addressed when com-\nuting the KSstatistic, leading to an effective smaller sample size n*,\nbtained using the following expression:\n\n? = n 1 ? p1\n1 + p1 (11)\nhere p1 is the lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient.\nThe PDFscore is a measure of agreement between two  distri-\n\nutions, where the common overlapping of the two probability\nensity functions (PDFs) is calculated. The PDFs are estimated using\nt Meteorology 202 (2015) 11\u201325\n\na number (N) of equally spaced bins, here defined as by Shimazaki\nand Shinomoto (2007). The two  normalized PDFs are then com-\npared as follows to obtain the PDFscore:\n\nPDFscore =\nN?\n\ni=1\nmin\n\n{\nf (mi), (g(mi))\n\n}\n(12)\n\nwhere f and g are the relative frequencies of each PDF, and mi is the\ncorresponding bin index. The PDFscore also spans between 0 and 1,\nbut contrary to the KSstatistic, a high degree of similarity between\nthe two  distributions corresponds to a score near 1. In order to\navoid the opposite scale direction of the two considered scores,\nthe value of 1 minus the KSstatistic (hereafter 1?KSstatistic) will be\npresented instead. Thus, in both cases the degree of match between\ndistributions will always grow from 0 to 1.\n\n3. Understanding the inter-annual variability of burnt\nareas\n\nThe main drivers of inter-annual variability of burnt areas in\nIberia in the four considered clusters were identified by discrim-\ninating the influence of pre-conditioning climatic conditions \u2013\ni.e., the accumulated stress on vegetation, and the consequent\nsusceptibility during the fire season \u2013 and the meteorological con-\nditions that foster fire ignition and spread during the fire season\n(Trigo et al., 2013). As stated in Section 2.1, there is a very sim-\nilar peak near March in the NW CLU and N CLU, although quite\ndifferent in its relative importance on the annual totals. This fact\nled us to focus only on the more representative season in terms\nof BA activity in each region, for the sake of readability. The\nmain links between the inter-annual BA variability in each clus-\nter and meteorological forcing are next analyzed, in order to retain\nthe most relevant variables that correlate with BA series. This\nprocedure will enable to test and select the sub-set of meteoro-\nlogical indices which will be used to develop statistical regression\nmodels.\n\n3.1. Links with meteorological indices\n\nThe influence of selected meteorological fields (T, Z and P)\nover BA series was tested using correlation analysis \u2013 performed\nat monthly (considering inter-annual anomalies) and daily scales\n(considering annual absolute values). For some meteorological\nvariables monthly anomalies are well correlated with Iberian BA\nseries (e.g. Pereira et al., 2005), still in some particular cases they\ncan mask some important daily-scale extreme weather episodes\nwhich trigger large fires, but do not affect significantly the monthly\nanomaly (Trigo et al., 2013). To account for these situations, we\ncomputed monthly percentiles for each variable. Then, we cal-\nculated monthly time series of the relative frequency of days\nexceeding those percentiles. In the case of T and Z \u2013 to take into\naccount the occurrence of extremely hot days \u2013 we considered the\n90th, 95th and 98th percentiles. In the case of P \u2013 with the attention\nfocused on the sequences of dry days \u2013 the application of the same\nprinciple lead to the computation of monthly frequencies of days\nwhere the mean precipitation in the whole cluster area was below\n0.5 mm,  1 mm and 2 mm.\n\nWe computed the correlations (Pearson\u2019s r) between BA and\nmonthly time series of anomalies or frequencies of extreme days\nfor each variable during the fire season months, and also from pre-\nvious months (up to 7 months before). The results are shown in\nTables 2 and 3.\nTable 2 is restricted to the links between BA and meteorological\nconditions during the fire season, revealing favorable conditions\nto trigger fire ignition and spread, regardless of the meteorolog-\nical background. As expected, results are dominated by monthly\n\n\n\nP.M.

In the N CLU (where the focus is in early spring) the fre-\nuency of days with extremely high values of Z is also positively\norrelated with BA,  meteorologically related with anomalous sta-\nle, clear sky and dry conditions in March.\n\nConcerning the months prior to the fire season (i.e. meteorolog-\ncal background), rather different forcing is found for each cluster\nTable 3). In the case of the NW CLU, the summer BA is signifi-\nantly associated with above-average temperature in late spring\nnd below-average precipitation in January and June, suggesting\nhat drier-than-average winters and springs in this wet region\nnhance vegetation vulnerability due to hydric stress, making it\nore susceptible to burn in the following summer (Chuvieco et al.,\n\n999).\nIn the SW CLU, dry and warm conditions in late spring or\n\narly summer are also related with high values of BA.  But unlike\nW CLU, a positive correlation between winter precipitation and\n\nummer BA series is found. This shows that for this drier region\nf Iberia, above-average winter precipitation favors vegetation\nrowth enhancing fuel availability in summer (Pereira et al., 2005;\n\nrigo et al., 2013). In the N CLU, the most important meteorological\nackground influence is concentrated in the immediately preced-\n\nng month (February), when the meteorological variables highly\nt Meteorology 202 (2015) 11\u201325 17\n\ncorrelated with March BA are quite similar to the ones found in\nTable 2, reinforcing the idea that high values of BA in the northern-\nmost sector of Iberia tend to be related with anomalous persisting\nhigh-pressure systems (blocking episodes) over the region.\n\nFor the easternmost region (E CLU), we find three statistically\nsignificant links, two  of them referring to below-average precipi-\ntation in spring, which suggests that in this region the persistence\nof dry conditions may  also enhance vegetation vulnerability during\nthe fire season. Nevertheless, the lack of significant links reduces\nthe prospects of using this type of background meteorological vari-\nables as good proxies for BA predictability in the E CLU. These\nresults unveil the crucial role of meteorological drivers on BA in\nthe Iberian Peninsula. This is particularly true for western sec-\ntors (NW CLU and SW CLU), where one-predictor truncated models\n(not shown), using only the monthly frequencies of days above the\n95th and 98th percentiles of T, respectively, explain about 50% of\nthe inter-annual BA variability in the months of July and August.\n\n3.2. Statistical hindcast models\n\nFollowing the stepwise predictor selection procedure and the\nadditional restrictions presented in Section 2.2, the best performing\nmodels obtained for each of the pyro-regions are described by the\nfollowing set of equations.\n\nFor the NW CLU:\n\nBAJul+Aug = +581000 T pct95Jul+Aug ? 35000 PanomJul+Aug\n+ (53300) ? 0.15 BAprev\n\nFor the SW CLU:\n\nBAJul+Aug = +1920000 T pct98Jul+Aug\n+ 11600 PanomFeb+May + (52000)\n\nFor the N CLU:\n\nBAMar = +133000 (T pct90Mar \u00d7 Zpct90Feb)\n+ 20500P &lt;0.5 mmFeb+Mar\n\nFor the E CLU:\n\nBAJul+Aug = +1600 T anom?#Jul+Aug + 2900 P &lt;1 mm\n?#\nJul+Aug\n\nwhere indices pct90, pct95 and pct98 correspond to monthly fre-\nquencies of exceedances for the corresponding percentiles (Section\n3.1), while indices&lt;0.5 mm and&lt;1 mm correspond to monthly fre-\nquencies of days with precipitation smaller than 0.5 mm and 1 mm,\nrespectively; anom indices refer to the monthly anomaly; the sym-\nbol ? corresponds to an aggravating factor based on the number\nof months with a deficit in rainfall; BAprev refers to a weighting of\nthe area burnt in the previous 3 years; the symbol # denotes a cor-\nrection factor due to the existence of a break-point in the series (as\npreviously discussed in Section 2.4). The aggravation factor based\non the conditions of \u201caccumulation of dry months\u201d was  introduced\nto take into account the hydric deficit inherited from antecedent\nmeteorological conditions.\n\nIn Figure 3, the resulting hindcast BA time series (using the ERA-\nInterim reanalysis) are compared with the observed BA series for\neach of cluster for the control period, including the model perfor-\nmance metrics.\nsignificantly better than the simpler persistence approach (Fig. 3).\nFurthermore, all models explain more than 50% of the regional BA\nreduced variance. This is particularly notable for the NW CLU and\n\n\n\n1  Fores\n\nS\nt\n7\nE\np\na\ng\nt\nf\ny\nt\nr\nt\nt\ni\n\n3\n\nd\nm\nc\ni\na\no\np\na\nE\nr\n\n1\nc\ne\ni\nt\nfl\nt\np\nm\nn\nw\np\na\nr\nt\nt\ns\nr\nt\nc\ni\nc\nd\nl\ne\nh\nt\na\nT\nc\ne\np\nc\nr\n\nA\n\n8 P.M. Sousa et al. / Agricultural and\n\nW CLU, where the models are able to adequately reproduce excep-\nional years in terms of BA (2005 and 2003), attaining around a\n0% of explained variance. Similar performance was attained in the\n\n CLU, but in this case the high performance of the models may  be\nartially inflated by the nature of the series after 1994 \u2013 these were\nll years with very small BA totals, as indicated by the large diver-\nence between r2 and ?sp (being the latter metric insensitive to\nhe confronted variable magnitudes). Finally, the lowest scores are\nound in the N CLU (focused in March). Yet, some of the most severe\nears (in terms of observed BA in this region) were reproduced by\nhe model (e.g., 1990, 1997 and 2000). Furthermore, despite the\nelatively low scores attained they still represent more than half of\nhe reduced variance. We  must stress that the values of BA series in\nhis region are about one order of magnitude below the ones found\nn the remaining clusters.\n\n.3. Synoptic forcing during severe wildfire episodes\n\nTaking into account the strong meteorological forcing of BA\nescribed in Section 3.2, and in order to distinguish the different\neteorological configurations that favor the occurrence of these\n\nonditions, we computed composites of meteorological fields dur-\nng these extreme days. Composites were computed on the (T, Z\nnd MSLP) meteorological fields (Fig. 4), providing an overview\nf the typical synoptic patterns related with large fires in each\nyro-region. Despite some differences, all four composites present\n\n common sharp positive T anomaly over most of southwestern\nurope, with their maxima (regarding the IP) centered at the cor-\nesponding pyro-region.\n\nIn the case of March fires in the N CLU, the composite (near\n00 days) presents well above average T in all of Europe, asso-\niated to a very large positive anomaly of Z over France, also\nxpressed at the surface level. This particular continental block-\nng configuration promotes subsidence over the region, and in\nhe particular case of northern Spain, brings a marked southerly\now, with exceptionally dry and warm conditions down slope of\nhe Cantabrian Range (Foehn winds). Spatial patterns of the com-\nosites for the remaining clusters reveal anomalous conditions\nore restricted to southwestern Europe, but with similar mag-\n\nitude in T anomalies in the target areas, also intimately related\nith large positive anomalies of Z and MSLP. The position of the\nositive anomaly of Z fields during July and August and associ-\nted with fires in the E CLU is quite similar to the previously\neferred case, but smaller in magnitude, promoting the advec-\nion of warmer African air over Iberia. Trigo et al. (2013) stated\nhat extremely hot days in the Mediterranean fac? ade require a\nurface flow from west or northwest in order to cease mild Mediter-\nanean breezes. Nevertheless, as seen in Section 3.2, the model for\nhis cluster suggests a stronger dependence on the lack of pre-\nipitation days during July and August as convective precipitation\nn late summer is relatively frequent in the area. The obtained\nomposite is highly compatible with the occurrence of prolonged\nry spells in the E CLU. NW CLU and SW CLU exhibit quite simi-\n\nar synoptic configurations. In both regions, large BA is driven by\nxtreme dry and hot days, directly related with the location of\nigh pressure systems in the Atlantic region between Iberia and\nhe British Isles. The main differences between the two  composites\nre the tilting of the ridge and the surface pressure configuration.\nhe positive anomaly of Z is tilted westwards (eastwards) in the\nase of the NW CLU (SW CLU). The spatial location of the high-\nst anomaly in T depends on the surface pressure configuration,\nortrayed by the position of the thermally induced low. In both\n\nases, easterly synoptic flows that attenuate Atlantic breezes are\nequired.\n\nThe Z anomalies in the composites suggest the existence of\ntlantic (continental) blocking in the cases of NW CLU and SW CLU\nt Meteorology 202 (2015) 11\u201325\n\n(N CLU and E CLU). It is rather difficult to classify the type of block-\ning pattern associated (i.e. Omega, Diffluent, etc.) since these maps\ndo not correspond to a few isolated days, but to composites ran-\nging between 50 and 100 days, depending on the case. This type of\napproach naturally smooths meteorological fields as it can capture\ndifferent types of blocking events and configurations centered in\nsimilar locations.\n\n4. Future scenarios of burned area\n\n4.1. RCM performance in the control period\n\nThe ability of each RCM to reproduce the observed distribu-\ntion during the control period (1981\u20132005) was  based on two\nmetrics: the PDFscore and the KSstatistic. The validation results for\neach individual meteorological variable analysis are presented as\nSupplementary Material (S 2). Considering the hindcast models cal-\nibrated with ERA-Interim as the benchmark, the performance of the\nconsidered RCMs modeling BA series for the control period was gen-\nerally lower, most likely due to their poor representation of daily\nvariability (as highlighted in Section 2.3). The SW CLU is the only\nregion where the ERA-Interim performance on modeling BA series\nis slightly overridden by the RCM models. On the contrary, the low-\nest RCM performance occurred in the E CLU. The summary of all BA\nmodels performance is summarized in Fig. S5 of the Supplementary\nMaterial.\n\n4.2. Future climate scenarios in Iberia\n\nBefore projecting future BA, we  assessed the predicted future\nclimatologies for the three future 25-year periods in each domain\n(Tables 4\u20137), focusing on the meteorological variables used as pre-\ndictors.\n\nObtained results reveal that in the northwestern sector of Iberia\nall models project a rise of 2\u20133 ?C in T during the months of July\nand August, while the standard deviation does not undergo signif-\nicant changes (Table 4). These projections imply a larger frequency\nof extremely hot days in the future, thus favoring larger BA.  It\nwas shown that in this pyro-region summer rainfall is also closely\nrelated to BA (Section 3.2) and all RCMs projections suggest a\ndecrease in summer P (in most models near to 50%) during the 21st\ncentury, particularly after 2050. Likewise, the projected number of\nrainy days in the July\u2013August period is projected to decrease nearly\na quarter by most models except for the REGCM3, where changes\nin rainfall regimes are not so significant.\n\nA similar sharp continuous increase in 12UTC July and August T\nis projected for the SW CLU (about 4 ?C for the 2051\u20132075 period\naccording to the HADRM3Q0 and REMO models, Table 5). Values\nof the standard deviation for the future T time series remain very\nsimilar to the ones found for the control period. All models except\nHADRM3Q0 suggest very few changes in the accumulated P during\nFebruary and May  (related to the available biomass in the following\nsummer) but show a decrease in the number of rainy days, unveil-\ning a drastic change of the precipitation regime, most accentuated\nin the case of the HADRM3Q0 model projections (to about one third\nin these months).\n\nConcerning the N CLU (Table 6) and focusing on changes in late\nwinter or early spring climatology, an increase of the mean March\nT, especially in the later period (2051\u20132075) is projected. However,\nfor the mid-21st century most models present mean values slightly\nbelow the control period and a small increase in the standard devi-\n\nation, related to an increase in the variability of meteorological\nconditions in this region. The exception is the HADRM3Q0 model,\nwhich projects a continuous rise in T (of about 3 ?C during the whole\nperiod) and a decrease in the mean February plus March P, as well\n\n\n\nP.M.

The HADRM3Q0 model shows an increase larger\nhan 4 ?C, projecting the most accentuated warming trend in Iberia\nmong all models analyzed. As in the other cases, no significant\nhanges are expected for T standard deviation. The number of rainy\nays is expected to decrease according to all model simulations.\nADRM3Q0\u2019s projections of mean P are almost 50% lower than for\n\nhe control period, with an also remarkable decrease in the number\nf rainy days (from 37 to 26). The REGCM3 is the only model that\nresents a small increase (2 mm)  in mean P, but once again, with\nrecipitation regimes being less regular, as the number of rainy\nays also decreases (8\u201314%).\n\n.3. Modeling future fire regimes\n\nBoth BC and DCM correction methods were applied to each RCM\nnd pyro-region in order to construct future BA series. One fur-\nher experiment was performed to increase the number of tested\nuture scenarios, consisting in two different methods of estimat-\nng the future predictors: (1) they all are calculated against the\nxed 1981\u20132005 means and percentiles; (2) they are calculated\ngainst each correspondent previous 25-year period means and\nercentiles. Naturally, the first method (hereafter, FIX CLIM) will\nesult in more drastic trends in future BA series, while the second\nethod (hereafter, MOV  CLIM) will tend to ease those trends. This\n\necond approach was considered just as a simplistic way to emu-\nate a certain level of gradual adaptation to climatic changes, rather\nhan assuming that all other non-meteorological variables related\nith fires (vegetation dynamics, human factors, etc.) will remain\nnchanged, as a result of the FIX CLIM approach.\n\nThe relative changes in the mean BA estimated for each cluster\nfter BC (Fig. 5) or the DCM (Fig. 6) are represented by circular\nreas, where inner and outer radius correspond to the two  predictor\nstimation methods (MOV CLIM and FIX CLIM, respectively). These\nhanges in future BA series are framed over axes that represent T\n\nnd P changes during the simulation period, in order to facilitate\nheir interpretation. The discussion of the obtained results will be\nocused mainly on the models which presented better scores in\neproducing BA series distribution in the control period.\n\nable 7\name as Table 4 but for the E CLU.\n\nE CLU 1981\u20132005 (control) 1981\u20132005 model bias \n\nJuly &amp; August mean\n12UTC T2m\n\n27.6 C (2.5) +4.1 C (+0.8) \n+0.2  C (+0.6) \n?0.7  C (+0.7) \n+1.5  C (+0.4) \n\nJuly  + August\nPrecipitation\n\n37 mm (37) +6 mm (+15) \n+0  mm (+1) \n+56  mm (+20) \n+24  mm (+9) \n116 mm (37) 121 mm (40) 123 mm (38) REGCM3\n115 mm (36) 125 mm (38) 126 mm (37) REMO\n\nAll models and methods reveal positive trends in future BA in all\nregions, but the dispersion amongst projections is quite significant.\nAs expected, results obtained with the FIX CLIM and MOV  CLIM\nmethods have important differences, with the latter presenting\nlower changes in future mean BA. We  must recall that the pro-\njections in Fig. 5 reflect the intrinsic daily variability of the RCM,\nreducing the confidence of model behavior for future scenarios.\n\nIn fact, in the NW CLU the projected negative change in P and\npositive change T during summer results in a significant increase\nin mean BA series. For example, considering the HADRM3Q0 and\nREMO models and the FIX CLIM simulations, estimated relative\nchanges are above 500% (which corresponds to a trend of about\n3800 ha year?1) and 400% (about 2800 ha year?1), respectively. The\ntrends in the MOV  CLIM simulations for these same models are\nreduced to less than half, but still more than doubling the present\nmean annual BA.  For the N CLU the rises in T drive important posi-\ntive changes in BA,  albeit the slight increase in P projected by most\nmodels. The RCM which performed better for this region in the con-\ntrol period (REGCM3) still projects four times more BA at the end\nof the considered future period (300 ha year?1 trend) using the BC.\nIn the SW CLU, where RCM models performed slightly better than\nERA-Interim during the control period, relatively similar trends\nin future BA were found. Using FIX CLIM simulations the rela-\ntive changes range between 400% and 600% (3500\u20134500 ha year?1),\nwhile using the MOV  CLIM simulations these trends decrease dras-\ntically to one third. Finally, in the E CLU, we found comparable\ntrends amongst all models except the HADRM3Q0, which yielded\nwildly large results (500% and 1000%), which seem unreliable in\nthe light of the results presented in Section 4.1. The BA relative\nchanges projected by the RACMO2 range between 250% and 350%\n(ca. 850 ha year?1 and 1300 ha year?1).\n\nProjected BA changes obtained with the DCM correction method\nusing FIX CLIM and MOV  CLIM experiments are more moder-\nate than in the case of BC. In the NW CLU, the HADRM3Q0\nmodel projects BA changes ranging between 300% and 400%\n(1500\u20132500 ha year?1 trends), while the REMO projects slightly\nhigher changes. In the N CLU, projections of BA using HADRM3Q0\nmodel simulations are very high and quite different from all other\n\nmodels which present relative changes smaller than 250% (around\n140 ha year?1). We  must recall that the HADRM3Q0 model stands\nalone by projecting a decrease in the mean February and March P\nin this region, associated to a more significant rise in late winter T\n\n2001\u20132025 2026\u20132050 2051\u20132075 RCM\n\n29.0 C (2.6) 30.4 C (2.9) 32.0 C (2.6) HADRM3Q0\n28.4 C (2.7) 29.4 C (2.5) 31.2 C (2.5) RACMO2\n28.3 C (2.6) 29.2 C (2.5) 30.7 C (2.5) REGCM3\n28.6 C (2.7) 29.4 C (2.5) 31.4 C (2.4) REMO\n32 mm (31) 30 mm (26) 23 mm (26) HADRM3Q0\n38 mm (33) 31 mm (31) 29 mm (30) RACMO2\n38 mm (34) 34 mm (32) 39 mm (32) REGCM3\n35 mm (32) 28 mm (30) 24 mm (29) REMO\n\n\n\nP.M.

In the\n CLU, the significant rise in summer T associated with an impor-\nant decrease in summer P and number of rainy days (see Section\n.2) may  explain the dramatic rate of change projected for BA,  even\nsing the MOV  CLIM simulations.

Consequently, the higher level of uncertainty found for future\nA projections in the N CLU and E CLU is also not unforeseen. The\n\narge dispersion found in the upper part of the E CLU and N CLU\ns driven by the HADRM3Q0 model, which presents the highest\nises in mean T in almost all areas, and also is the only model which\nredicts a decrease in February and March P in northernmost areas.\n\nEven though it is clear that different approaches result in a rela-\nively wide range of severity scenarios, the overall ensemble means\noint to about 2 or 3 three times more BA in most Iberian regions,\nxcept for the northern fac? ade where the mean projections change\nall slightly above a doubling factor.\n\n. Concluding remarks\n\nOur work has shown that statistical models which use monthly\n\nrequencies of exceedances of high percentiles of noon temperature\nfrom the ERA-Interim dataset) as the key predictor can be quite\nffective in representing the inter-annual variability of burnt area\nexplaining more than two thirds of the variance in most areas).\nge method for future trends estimation.\n\nThis is a concise method to represent the most propitious condi-\ntions for fire ignition and spread \u2013 sequences of abnormally hot\nand dry days. Furthermore, these models recall the need to rely\non daily scale data in order to account for these short temporal\nscale features, although larger time-scales prove to be sufficient\nregarding the meteorological background. These results are partic-\nularly compelling for western areas of Iberia, where meteorology\nalone is more crucial on wildfire activity (Trigo et al., 2013), while\nin other areas external factors have a larger weight (Bedia et al.,\n2014).\n\nThe role of atmospheric blocking on wildfire variability (Trigo\net al., 2006) was  scrutinized in each pyro-region, and our com-\nposites show that the specific locations of high pressure anomaly\ncenters establish the direction of surface flows, thus distinguishing\nthe synoptics that originate inland dry and warm air advection in\neach domain. In addition, the occurrence of a meteorological back-\nground marked by prolonged blocking events is directly related\n\nwith a higher vegetation stress that arises from prolonged dry spells\n(Flannigan et al., 2000; Gedalof et al., 2005; Soja et al., 2007).\n\nFuture fire regime projections based on GCM or RCM out-\nputs must be carefully considered, as besides the inherent model\n\n\n\nP.M.

Ensembles of projected mean Burnt Area (BA) until 2075 in the four Iberian cl\nresented in Figs. 5 and 6. The above dashed line represents the mean of the 8 FIX \nimulations. Darker (lighter) shades represent ensemble uncertainties of FIX CLIM \nimulations. A 25-year moving average was applied to all series.\n\nncertainties and projections spread, other confounding factors\nxist (mainly anthropogenic, see e.g. King et al., 2013), and also\nlimate-vegetation feedbacks affecting burned area should be con-\nidered (e.g. Krawchuk and Moritz, 2010; Pausas and Paula, 2012).\nurthermore, the extent of the feedback on the concentration of\nerosols, particulates and black carbon induced by an increased\npatial and temporal frequency of wildfires is a quite significant\nssue, particularly on the perturbations which should be consid-\nred on climate models (Lavou\u00e9 et al., 2000; Gillett et al., 2004;\nanderson et al., 2006; Hodzic et al., 2007; Sommers et al., 2014).\nevertheless, the RCMs performance during our control period\nave us enough confidence to extrapolate them to a warmer period,\nuch as expected in the upcoming decades. All our future pro-\nections point toward a significant rise in mean annual BA in all\nyro-regions - ensembles future means between 200% and 300% by\n075. Carvalho et al. (2007) predicted a much larger increase (near\n00%) in BA for mainland Portugal by the end of the 21st century.\nuch differences highlight the crucial importance of how the intrin-\nic daily variability in RCMs is managed when constructing future\ncenarios. We  feel confident that the delta change method results\ns a good and simple alternative to the more conventional unbias-\nng method in order to circumvent the inaccurate representation\nf current climate in RCMs, namely at the daily scale. However,\nince the nature of daily variability will also change in the future,\no correction method can completely avoid this problem.\n\nIt is evident that as further away from the present climate we  try\no extrapolate, the more weight external factors will have. Surely at\nome point prior to 2075 the influence of these external factors will\n\nvertake the validity of present time models purely based on mete-\nrology. In particular, we stress that the incorporation of land-use\nhange models in this type of simulations may  be a determinant\nactor for extending the validity and confidence of extrapolations\n. The solid line represents the mean of all 16 considered members of the simulations\nsimulations, while the below shaded line represents the mean of the 8 MOV CLIM\n\n CLIM) simulations, and where obtained using the inter-quartiles of each group of\n\nbased on model projections, as already discussed by Moss et al.\n(2010) and Brovkin et al. (2013). In conclusion, as any other pro-\njections based on RCM data, these trends should be envisaged\ncarefully, and seen as a tendency based on the current state of fire\nprevention, forest management, and projected climate scenarios. In\nfact, the main lesson to take from such alarming projections is the\nurge for preparing and mitigating changes that seem inevitable in\nterms of climate and environment, as current state-of-the-art mod-\neling insists in warming and drying trends in the Mediterranean,\nand particularly on the Iberian Peninsula (MARN, 2006; AEMET-IM,\n2011; Ramos et al., 2011; Gouveia et al., 2011).\n\nConflicts of interests\n\nThe authors have no conflict of interest to declare.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nPedro M.

A novel common dataset was\nassembled for the whole IP by merging the registered BA from 66 administrative regions of both Portugal and Spain.\nWe applied a cluster analysis to identify larger regions with similar fire regimes and results point to the existence of four\nclusters (Northwestern, Northern, Southwestern and Eastern) whose spatial patterns and seasonal fire regimes are shown to\nbe related with constraining factors such as topography, vegetation cover and climate conditions. The relationship between\nBA at monthly time scale with both long-term climatic pre-conditions and short-term synoptic forcing was assessed using\ncorrelation and regression analysis based on: (1) temperature and precipitation from 2 to 7 months in advance to fire peak\nseason, (2) synoptic weather patterns derived from 11 distinct Weather Types Classifications (WTC). Different relations\nwere obtained for each IP region with a relevant link being identified between BA and short-term synoptic forcing for all\nclusters, while the relation with long-term climatic preconditioning was relevant for all but one cluster. Stepwise regression\nmodels based on the best climatic and synoptic circulation predictors were developed with cross-validation to avoid over\nfitting. The performance of the models varies within IP regions, though models exclusively based on WTC tend to better\nreproduce the annual BA time series than those merely based on pre-conditioning climatic information. Nevertheless,\nthe use of both synoptic and climatic predictors provides the best results, particularly for the two western clusters, with\nPearson correlation coefficient values higher than 0.7. Finally, it is shown that typical synoptic configurations that favour\nhigh values of BA correspond to dry and warm wind flows associated with anti-cyclonic regimes.\n\nKEY WORDS wildfires; Iberian Peninsula; weather types; cluster analysis; regression models\n\nReceived 14 November 2011; Revised 29 April 2013; Accepted 3 May 2013\n\n1. Introduction\n\nIt is widely known that, as a consequence of the Mediter-\nranean type of climate, the southern European countries\n(Portugal, Spain, France, Italy and Greece) are partic-\nularly affected by summer fires (Barbosa et al ., 2007;\nJRC, 2010). The frequent warm and dry meteorologi-\ncal conditions found in summer play an obvious role\nin the triggering and spreading of these fires. Moreover,\nrecent and future trends towards a dryer (Mariotti et al .,\n2008; Mariotti, 2010; Sousa et al ., 2011) and warmer\n(Giorgi, 2006; Fischer and Scha?r, 2010) Mediterranean\nclimate will tend to exacerbate the problem. However,\nwhile the prevailing weather conditions play an important\nrole it must be acknowledged that human contribution is\nalso significant either in Spain (Valbuena-Caraban?a et al .,\n\n* Correspondence to: R. M. Trigo, Centro de Geof??sica da Universidade\nde Lisboa, Faculdade de Cie?ncias, Univ. de Lisboa, Campo Grande, Ed\nC8, Piso 6, 1749-016 LISBOA, Portugal. E-mail: rmtrigo@fc.ul.pt\n\n2010) or in Portugal (Costa et al ., 2010). For example, the\nwidespread abandonment and depopulation of rural areas\nin Iberia in the last decades has contributed to an increase\nin fuel availability for the ignition and spreading of fires\n(Pausas and Vallejo, 1999; Lloret et al ., 2002). This pat-\ntern of events is in line with the rest of the Mediterranean\nbasin, where areas of scarcely relevance for agriculture\nwere either converted to forest plantations or abandoned\nto the natural process of ecological succession, often con-\nverted to shrublands and woodlands (Moreno et al ., 1998;\nPausas and Vallejo, 1999). In fact, it should be noticed\nthat the use of fire as a tool to modify the landscape\nhas been used on much longer temporal scales through-\nout the Holocene in both southern Iberian Peninsula (IP)\n(Gil-Romera et al ., 2010) as well as in northern Iberia\n(Rubiales et al ., 2008).\n\nAmong all northern Mediterranean regions, it must be\nstressed that wildfires constitute a major and recurrent\nhazard in the IP. Their occurrence is responsible for a\nvery large amount of burnt area (BA) every year, as well\nas for significant human and socio-economical impacts.\n\n? 2013 Royal Meteorological Society\n\n\n\nR. M. TRIGO et al.\n\nFor example, during the period 1980 \u2013 2009, the average\nannual BA by wildfires in Portugal (Spain) was about\n109 000 ha (177 000 ha) (Pereira et al ., 2011a). However,\nif we compute the ratio of total BA by the country\ntotal land area, Portugal leads the rank of European\ncountries most affected by fires, with a ratio up to three\ntimes higher than Italy, the second most fire-affected\ncountry (Pereira et al ., 2011a). Nevertheless spatial\ndistribution patterns of fire occurrences and BA are\nnot homogeneous within southern Europe, neither within\neach country (JRC, 2010). On the basis of data compiled\nbetween 1985 and 1997 (European Commission, 1998),\nnorthwestern Iberia (Portugal and the Spanish Provinces\nof Galicia) is the European region with the largest\npercentage of fire occurrences (roughly 50% of total\nnumber of fires), followed by southern Italy (10%) and\nthe triangle Provence-Tuscany-Corsica (7%) (EC, 1998;\nPereira et al ., 2005). However, one should be careful\nbecause these annual average values hide a remarkable\nlevel of inter-annual variability. For example, focusing\non the burned surface in Portugal between 2003 and\n2007, the exceptional summers of 2003 (450 000 ha) and\n2005 (380 000 ha), present the highest values of BA since\nrobust statistics started to be compiled in 1980 (Trigo\net al ., 2006; Pereira et al ., 2011a), contrast with average-\nsummers like 2004 or 2006 (120 000 and 80 000 ha of BA,\nrespectively), or even 2007, which represents the second\nlowest record with just 30 000 ha of BA (Pereira et al .,\n2011a).\n\nThe number of fires and their extent in mid-latitude\nregions are controlled primarily by natural factors (e.g.\ntopography, weather conditions and vegetation cover),\nby land management practices responsible for anthro-\npogenic ignitions, and also by fire prevention, manage-\nment and suppression efforts. Changes in the frequency\nof occurrence of specific atmospheric conditions, which\nare favourable to the outbreak and consequent spread-\ning of large wildfires, can help explaining the magnitude\nof this inter-annual variability (Viegas and Viegas, 1994;\nPyne et al ., 1996, Kunkel, 2001). In the context of large\nfire occurrences in the IP, a number of works has focused\nobjectively on the role played by meteorological factors,\nnamely in Portugal (Trigo et al ., 2006; Hoinka et al .,\n2009; Carvalho et al ., 2008) and in Spain (Va?zquez and\nMoreno, 1993; Pin?ol et al ., 1998; Pausas, 2004; Padilla\nand Vega-Garc??a, 2009; Rasilla et al ., 2010; Pausas and\nFerna?ndez-Mun?oz, 2011). Moreover, several works have\nproved that Iberian fires are also associated with the\noccurrence of anomalous climate in the preceding seasons\n(Viegas and Viegas, 1994; Pereira et al ., 2005). However,\na growing number of studies focused on the anthro-\npogenic contribution towards the spatial distribution of\nIberian fires (Ve?lez, 1993, Bad??a et al ., 2002; Lloret\net al ., 2002; Va?zquez et al ., 2002; Cueva et al ., 2006;\nCosta et al ., 2010). Among these, one of the most com-\nprehensive approaches corresponds to the recent work\nof Costa et al . (2010), where the authors focus on the\nsensitivity of Portuguese forest fires to climatic, human\nactivity and landscape. Similarly, in Cueva et al . (2006),\n\nthe authors showed the dependence of regional patterns of\nforest fires in Spain on numerous human, landscape and\nclimatic factors that change frequently in time and space.\n\nDespite the amount of studies, there are still issues\nto be further addressed in relation to the interactions\nbetween meteorological conditions, vegetation dynamics\nand fires. In the Mediterranean region, drought periods\ncan have strong impacts in vegetation activity (Gou-\nveia et al ., 2009), with significant losses of crop yields\n(Austin et al ., 1998), decreasing of terrestrial net primary\nproduction (Zhao and Running, 2010) and forest growing\n(Mart??nez-Villalta et al ., 2008) and increasing the risk of\nforest fires (Pausas, 2004). It is now widely accepted that\nchanges in large-scale atmospheric circulation is partially\nresponsible for decreasing precipitation trends and higher\nfrequency of drought episodes over Iberia (Paredes et al .,\n2006; Garc??a-Herrera et al ., 2007). Moreover, such a\ntrend towards a drier Mediterranean climate is in very\ngood agreement with state-of-the-art climate change\nprojections for different future scenarios (Giorgi, 2006).\nFinally, other studies have proved that the occurrence of\nmajor droughts in southern Europe during the preceding\nwinter and spring seasons can enhance the amplitude\nof heat waves on the following summer (Seneviratne\net al ., 2006; Fischer et al ., 2007), implying that these\ntwo phenomena (droughts and heat waves) are closely\nrelated.\n\nA number of studies have used remote sensing\nimagery-derived datasets over the Mediterranean region\nto analyse changes in vegetation activity (Vicente-Serrano\nand Heredia-Lacaustra, 2004; Gouveia et al ., 2008),\nhave determined the impact of droughts (Vicente-Serrano,\n2007; Gouveia et al ., 2009) and have monitored plant\nrecovery after fire (Viedma et al ., 2006, Gouveia et al ,\n2010). Several vegetation indices can be used to assess\nvegetation dynamics; however, the Normalized Dif-\nference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is the most widely\nemployed (Myneni et al ., 1995; Gouveia et al ., 2008).\n\nPereira et al . (2005) found that the daily synop-\ntic variability in Portugal is the most important driver\nof favourable local fire-prone weather conditions. Bear-\ning this in mind, atmospheric circulation classifications\nbecome an important potential tool to study the role of\nweather in wildfire occurrence in the IP. Furthermore,\nimpacts on fire activity of large scale circulation pat-\nterns in the atmosphere and in the ocean have been used\nwith the aim of developing short- and long-range forecast\nmodels for wildfire occurrences by several authors. In this\nrespect, Flannigan et al . (2001) explored the relationship\nbetween Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) and BA\nin Canada to build a forecasting model of monthly and\nseasonal fire activity. Here, we intend to apply a similar\napproach on the specific context of the IP, and to intro-\nduce Weather Types Classification (WTC) on a deeper\nassessment of fire-season predictability for this region. In\nthis work, we will be mostly focused on the relationship\nbetween meteorological and BA inter-annual variability,\nthrough the use of summer synoptic circulation and pre-\nvious climatological conditions in the entire IP.\n\n? 2013 Royal Meteorological Society Int. J. Climatol. (2013)\n\n\n\nMODELLING WILDFIRE ACTIVITY IN IBERIA\n\nWTCs are a recurrent and fairly simple method to\ndescribe atmospheric circulation variability at daily and\nsub-daily scale, as they provide discrete characterizations\nof the atmospheric conditions. They have been widely\nused in several contexts and, as a consequence, a large\nvariety of classification methods (automated or not) have\nbeen developed with multiple purposes. Here we are con-\nsidering the WTCs developed within the framework of\nthe COST Action 733 \u2014 Harmonization and applications\nof WTC for European Regions (COST733) catalogue.\n\nThe COST733 catalogue comprehends the largest set\nof classifications ever assembled for different regions\nof Europe. These are based on numerous methods and\nmeteorological variables and have been applied to sev-\neral spatial domains centred on different European sub-\nregions. We intend to make the best use of this catalogue\nand perform an objective comparison on the ability of\neach classification to explain wildfire variability in the\nIP domain. Numerous objective comparisons for the cat-\nalogue have been performed on several areas of study,\nsuch as heavy precipitation occurrence (Lupikasza, 2010;\nTwardosz, 2010), extreme values of air temperature (Ustr-\nnul et al ., 2010), lightning activity (Pineda et al ., 2010),\nair pollution (Le?sniok et al ., 2010). Preliminary works\nrelating WTC with wildfire occurrences have been devel-\noped for Iberia (Rasilla et al ., 2010) and Greece (Kas-\nsomenos, 2010). However, Rasilla et al . (2010) did not\nuse WTC from the COST733 catalogue, but rather his\nown classifications, based on Principal Components and\nCluster analyses.\n\nTherefore, the main objectives of this work are the\nfollowing:\n\n(1) To obtain a novel comprehensive wildfire dataset for\nthe entire IP and to distinguish fairly independent\nregions in terms of BA characteristics and fire regime\nfor each region;\n\n(2) To provide an interpretation on the spatial distribution\nof BA in terms of the topography, climate and\nvegetation dynamics in the IP;\n\n(3) To analyse the relationships and dependence of\nBA inter-annual variability with previous seasonal\nclimatological conditions, namely precipitation and\nair temperature;\n\n(4) To examine the performance of the different WTC\navailable from COST733 catalogue as indicators for\nthe BA inter-annual variability;\n\n(5) To test the ability of simple statistical regres-\nsion models to reproduce the inter-annual variabil-\nity of BA, using climatological data and WTC as\npredictors.\n\nThe rest of this manuscript has the following structure:\nthe datasets used in this study and the climate of IP are\ndescribed in Section 2, while the identification of the most\nimportant spatial regions with identical fire behaviour\nwas obtained with cluster analysis in Section 3. The links\nbetween BA for each cluster and previous meteorological\nfields and/or the frequency of each weather type (WT)\n\nare evaluated in Section 4, while Section 5 provides\na description of the most important WT patterns asso-\nciated with fire occurrences at each cluster previously\nidentified. Finally, section 6 is devoted to the discussion\nof obtained results and to present the conclusions of\nthis study.\n\n2. Datasets and main characteristics of the study\narea\n\nThis work relies on three types of data series, namely:\n(1) WT catalogues and meteorological variables; (2) BA\nin both Iberian countries (Portugal and Spain) and (3)\nvegetation index.\n\n2.1. WT catalogues\n\nWTC data was obtained from the COST733 project\n(Philipp et al ., 2010) and although available since 1958 it\nends in 2001, which constrains its use to the 22-year long\nperiod (1980 \u2013 2001) to be coincident with fire data. We\nonly considered classifications with nine categories (in\na total of 11 classifications), and exclusively worked in\nthe domain D09 that is centred over the IP. This domain\n(amongst all available for the catalogue) is represented\nin Figure 1, together with all the remaining regional and\npan-European domains. The acronym of the considered\n11 classifications is presented in Table I, together with\nthe climatic elements and main methodological methods\nused in their construction.\n\n2.2. A climate characterization of the IP\n\nThe climate of the study area is characterized by\nusing the mean monthly precipitation and temperature\nseries obtained from long Climatic Research Unit (CRU)\ngridded dataset \u2014 version TS3.0 at the resolution of\n0.5? \u00d7 0.5? latitude (Mitchell and Jones, 2005). To assess\nthe IP climatology within the appropriate context, we\nmust acknowledge the main physical attributes of the\nregion, namely the topography and mountain ranges.\nThese geographical characteristics and the political bor-\nders of the Iberian countries are depicted in Figure 2.\n\nMaps of annual averages of surface temperature and\nprecipitation in the IP computed for the 1980 \u2013 2005\nperiod using the CRU gridded dataset are shown in\nFigure 3. The overall patterns are quite similar to higher\nresolution Iberian climate atlas maps of annual average\nmean air temperature and precipitation computed for the\n1971 \u2013 2000 period (AEMET-IM, 2011) obtained with\nobserved data from a large number of meteorological\nand udometric stations. The annual precipitation in the\nIP (Figure 3, top panel) presents a SE \u2013 NW gradient,\nwith higher values in the coastal regions extending\nfrom Lisbon, in central Portugal to Galicia (northwestern\nSpain) and also to the northern mountainous regions\n(including the Cantabria and Pyrenees) and the lowest\nvalues found in the southern-eastern corner of the IP.\nAnnual mean air temperature (Figure 3, bottom panel)\n\n? 2013 Royal Meteorological Society Int.

A fire database for the IP (1980 \u2013 2005)\n\nWe have considered BA data from fire occurrences over\nPortugal and Spain in order to produce a joint database for\nIberia (and Baleares islands) as these European countries\n\nhave long and homogeneous time series of fire data\nsince 1980 (Barbosa et al ., 2007; JRC, 2010). Portuguese\nfire data was obtained from the Autoridade Florestal\nNacional (AFN, 2011), while Spanish data was obtained\nfrom the Direccio?n General de Biodiversidad. Pereira\net al . (2011a) provides a comprehensive description of\nthe history and characteristics of the Portuguese fire\ndatabase for the 1980 \u2013 2005 period. It was found that\nduring the 1980s the minimum amount of BA was 0.1 ha\n(i.e. all fires smaller than 0.1 ha where not considered)\nand this threshold has been reduced subsequently, being\ncurrently in the order of 0.0001 ha. These changes\nare important as they introduce artificial trends on the\nnumber of fires time series and, consequently, on the\naverage BA per fire. However, the contribution of all\nthese very small fires does not change significantly\nthe annual (or summer) BA (Pereira et al ., 2011a).\nThe Spanish database has also been analysed in the\nrecent past (Moreno et al ., 1998) and has been shown\nto be increasingly reliable (Carracedo Mart??n et al .,\n2009). Although available since 1976, two northern\nSpanish regions present significant amounts of missing\ndata: A?lava (1980 \u2013 1984) and Navarra (1980 \u2013 1984 and\n1994 \u2013 2002). These missing values were replaced by the\nlong-term monthly mean BA in each of these regions,\na procedure with very limited impact as these regions\npresent mean annual BA values below 0.5 and 0.1% of\ntheir total areas, respectively.\n\nThis new Iberian database refers to the common\nperiod of 1980 \u2013 2005 for both countries BA time series.\nMonthly BA time series are spatially disaggregated on\nsimilar size administrative regions (AR): in the case\nof Portugal by Distritos , and in the case of Spain\nby Provincias (Figure 4). For both countries, we have\n\n? 2013 Royal Meteorological Society Int. J. Climatol. (2013)\n\n\n\nMODELLING WILDFIRE ACTIVITY IN IBERIA\n\nFigure 2.

Annual mean normalized burnt area (NBA) in the Iberian Peninsula for the 1980 \u2013 2005 period (in permillage) on a regional basis,\ncomposed by the Portuguese (Distritos ) and Spanish (Provincias ) administrative regions (AR). The NBA is defined as the quotient between the\n\namount of burned area (BA) in each of the AR and the area of that AR.\n\nnot used the BA observed in the Portuguese (Azores\nand Madeira for Portugal) and Spanish (Canary Islands)\nAtlantic archipelagos and, in the end, the database spatial\ndomain covers a total of 66 AR: 18 in Portugal and\n48 in Spain. As these AR have considerably different\nsurface areas, it is not appropriate (for some purposes)\nto compare BA directly among them. To circumvent this\nproblem, besides the absolute amount of BA per region\nwe have also computed the monthly Normalized Burnt\nArea (NBA) for each AR, defined as the quotient between\nthe amount of BA in each of the AR and the area of the\ncorresponding AR. Since both these quantities have the\nsame units, NBA will be presented in permillage. After\nthis normalization procedure, the monthly and annual\naverages for the NBA dataset for each of the 66 AR\nwere computed. Annual mean NBA values for all the 66\nIberian AR (Figure 4) reveal that the northwestern sector\nof Iberia, which includes central and northern Portugal\nand northwestern Spain (mostly Galicia and Asturias),\nis the most affected by wildfires, presenting averaged\nvalues higher than 20\u2030. The eastern and northeastern\ncoastal areas of Spain (Catalunya and Valencia) are also\nmoderately prone to wildfires (with NBA values between\n10 and 20\u2030 of their total area). Most central and southern\nregions of Iberia (except the Algarve region) do not\npresent significant amounts of annual NBA (below 5\u2030).\nHowever, it must be acknowledged that this analysis\nbased on NBA values still presents a caveat, since the\nnormalization with the total districts/province\u2019s surface\narea can induce a bias in the final results. In fact, ARs\nhave different percentage of vegetated area and some ARs\n(e.g. Zaragoza in Spain or Algarve in Portugal) have a\nrelatively small fraction of forestry surface, albeit highly\nconcentrated in smaller mountainous sub-domains.\n\n2.4. Vegetation dynamics in IP\n\nNDVI monthly anomalies, with 8 km of spatial resolu-\ntion, were obtained from the Global Inventory Modelling\n\nand Mapping Studies (GIMMS) dataset and correspond\nto the most complete and longest remote sensing dataset,\ncovering the entire Mediterranean region, for the period\n1982 \u2013 2006 (Tucker et al ., 2005).\n\nVegetation over the Mediterranean basin and specifi-\ncally over the IP presents high diversity, resulting from\nclimate, landscape, topography and other factors. To iden-\ntify the main types of vegetation cover over Iberia, a\ncluster analysis of the monthly means of NDVI for the\nentire period was performed, using four clusters depicted\nin Figure 5 (top panel). These four clusters correspond\napproximately to the four main vegetation types over\nIberia. The cluster represented in blue coincides almost\nexactly with the extension of the Eurosiberian phytocli-\nmatic region across the IP (Rivas Mart??nez, 1987), char-\nacterized by low temperature and abundant and regular\nwater supply. The spatial domain of this cluster broadly\ncorresponds to regions included within the 800 mm iso-\nhyets, a threshold traditionally used to delimitate the\n\u2018green\u2019 (Csa, Csb and Cfb on Ko?ppen Classification)\nIberia from the drier Mediterranean regions. Its natu-\nral vegetation is alpine or deciduous forest, currently\ncomposed by pastures and secondary forest plantations\n(eucalyptus, pinus) that presents high activity throughout\nthe entire year, with a maximum in spring (Figure 5, bot-\ntom panel), but deeply dependent on water resources. The\ncluster represented in yellow groups two different land-\nscapes: (1) an ecotone transition (semideciduous forest)\nthrough the southern piedmont of the mountains of north-\nern Spain (Cordillera Canta?brica and Pyrenees) and (2)\nthe typical Mediterranean sclerophyllous forests (some-\ntimes grazed \u2014 dehesas ) across most of the mountains\nand plateaus of central and southern IP. This cluster\ncomprehends large areas of annual (mainly not irrigated)\ncrops characterized by the overall highest NDVI values\nduring the entire seasonal cycle and with a maximum in\nsummer (Figure 5, bottom panel). The cluster represented\nin green corresponds to the central areas of both Mesetas\n\n? 2013 Royal Meteorological Society Int. J. Climatol.

These regions\nseem to share in common a dominant (in some cases irri-\ngated) agricultural activity. This cluster presents lower\nvegetation activity (lower NDVI values) than the pre-\nvious two, with a maximum during spring, due to the\navailability of water during this season \u2014 a feature usu-\nally associated to scrublands. The last cluster, plotted in\norange presents very low values of NDVI over the entire\nyear (Figure 5, bottom panel), corresponding to the typ-\nical regions characterized with very sparse vegetation or\neven bare soil. It resembles the most arid environments\nof the IP, (Ebro valley, La Mancha, SE Spain), charac-\nterized by a stepped-like vegetation (when/where there is\nvegetation) as consequence of high summer temperatures\nand scarce annual precipitation (below 400 mm).\n\n3. Regionalizing fire regimes in the IP\n\nIn the previous section, BA datasets from both Iberian\ncountries were merged and a preliminary analysis\nwas performed to obtain the spatially NBA dataset.\nThese procedures were required before applying the\nmethodology that aims to objectively identify the\nmost important fire regimes within the IP. For this\n\npurpose, we performed a Cluster Analysis, using the\nK-means algorithm, on the NBA in the 66 considered\nAR disposed in a T-mode matrix. We decided to retain\nfour statistically significant clusters (Figure 6), since\nthe obtained pattern presents regions with higher spatial\nhomogeneity in comparison with spatial configurations\nattained with a higher number of clusters, as it will\nbe shown later. Furthermore, this result is concordant\nwith the defined regionalization defined by Rasilla et al .\n(2010), also with four sub-regions, and presents a strong\nresemblance with the operative regionalization used by\nthe Spanish authorities (MARN, 2011).\n\nWe must stress that the configuration presented in\nFigure 6 does not correspond exactly to the cluster analy-\nsis output. A small number (six) of neighbouring Spanish\nAR were swapped in order to define a more spatially\nhomogeneous set of four clusters. These AR are identified\nwith a small circle in Figure 6 and these changes were\nconsidered valid to perform, as they refer to ARs with\nlow mean annual values of NBA (usually below 5\u2030, as\nshown in Figure 2). Taking into account the geograph-\nical location of the resulting four clusters, these were\nnamed respectively: northwest (NW_CLU); southwest\n(SW_CLU); north (N_CLU) and east (E_CLU).\n\n? 2013 Royal Meteorological Society Int.

The coastal and pre-coastal ARs\neast of Gibraltar correspond to the E_CLU (including\nthe Baleares islands). Finally, the N_CLU corresponds\nto the regions located in the mountainous sectors of\nnorthern Spain (including Asturias, Cantabria and the\nBasque Country).\n\nThe main purpose of applying this Cluster Analysis\nwas to identify the Iberian regions with similar temporal\nvariability. In fact, all four regions shown in Figure 6\nhave a clear annual cycle of the mean monthly NBA, with\nthe main differences being found in the amplitude and\ntiming of the maximum values (Figure 7, top panel). The\nNW_CLU clearly represents the AR more affected by\nwildfires, with nearly 10\u2030 of the total area being burned,\non average, every August. The mean peaks of the other\nclusters are all below 3\u2030 of their area. Interestingly,\ntwo of the identified clusters present two maxima, with\nthe NW_CLU revealing a much larger peak in August\nand a smaller one in March. The northernmost areas of\nIberia are concentrated in the N_CLU that presents two\npeaks, both comparable in magnitude (relatively small\nalthough), in spring (March) and late summer (Septem-\nber). Finally, the two remaining clusters are characterized\nby a single summer maximum in July and in August in\nthe case of E_CLU and SW_CLU cluster, respectively.\n\nThe boxplots of monthly NBA (Figure 7, bottom panel)\nalso help to characterize the intra-annual evolution of\nlocation (median), dispersion (IQR), range (maximum\nminus minimum) and asymmetry characteristics of the\nNBA distribution in each cluster. In general, the annual\nevolution of location, range and dispersion statistics\npresent a similar annual cycle of the mean monthly NBA,\nwith similar ratios between the amplitude and timing of\nthe maximum values. Only a few number of discrepancies\nof that annual cycle are worth to mention, namely: (1)\nthe median in July is similar than the one in August\nfor the SW_CLU; (2) secondary maximum values of the\nmedian (the first peak, in late winter and beginning of\nspring) occurs in February, and not in March as for\nthe mean monthly NBA, and is about 75% higher for\nN_CLU than for the NW_CLU. The temporal evolution\nof the quartile skewness reveals that monthly NBA\ndistribution is essentially positive skewed, (with a few\nexceptions), presenting high intra-annual variability and\nsmaller values for the western clusters (NW_CLU and\nSW_CLU) during summer/fire season and the opposite\nbehaviour for the other two cluster (except for N_CLU\nin June and July).\n\nThe spatial patterns of the four NBA clusters and the\ncorrespondent fire regimes are also in good agreement\nwith topography (Figure 2), climate conditions (Figure 3)\nand vegetation dynamics (Figure 5). Actually, the NW_-\nCLU corresponds to the relatively low land coastal areas\nin the north western Atlantic coast of the IP while the\nSW_CLU includes the lowlands in the SW region of the\nIP and the large Meseta Central (Figure 2).

Mean monthly time series (above) and boxplots (below) of normalized burned area (NBA \u2014 defined as the quotient between the amount\nof BA in each of the AR and the area of the AR, both in hectares), in the 1980 \u2013 2005 period for the four NBA clusters shown in Figure 6 and\n\nusing the same colour palette as in Figure 6.\n\nand high plateau is surrounded by the Cantabrian Moun-\ntains (Cordillera Canta?brica) region that corresponds to\nthe N_CLU and by the Ibe?rico and Penibe?tico systems\nwhich delimits the E_CLU along with the Mediterranean\ncoasts of Iberia (Figure 2). The climate of these four\nregions is also very different and helps to put into per-\nspective some characteristics of their vegetation cover\n(Figure 5) and fire regime (Figures 6 and 7), namely the\n\nyearly amount of BA, the fire season duration and peak\ntiming. Besides mean annual precipitation and tempera-\nture spatial patterns (Figure 3), the climate characteriza-\ntion of IP requires some knowledge on the intra-annual\ntemporal and spatial variability, e.g. the typical conditions\nduring the cold (winter) and warm (summer) seasons.\nAccording to the Iberian Climate Atlas (AEMET-IM,\n2011), the winter and summer mean precipitation and\n\n? 2013 Royal Meteorological Society Int. J. Climatol. (2013)\n\n\n\nR. M. TRIGO et al.\n\ntemperature conditions in these four regions are as fol-\nlows. The N_CLU and NW_CLU are clearly the wettest\nclusters (Figure 3) and that implies a compatible vegeta-\ntion cover (blue colour in Figure 5). However, these two\nfire regime clusters diverge in terms of their annual tem-\nperature. Thus the N_CLU is characterized by wet and\ncold winters and by humid and fresh summers (AEMET-\nIM, 2011) which supports the fact that this is one of\nthe regions less affected by wildfires (Figure 7). On the\ncontrary, the climate (and associated vegetation cover) of\nthe NW_CLU is the most appropriate for the occurrence\nand development of fires during the dry and hot sum-\nmer season because these conditions follow the humid\nand mild winters (AEMET-IM, 2011). Figure 4 con-\nfirms (through the NBA spatial pattern) that these are\nthe most favourable conditions for the occurrence of\nwildfires, allowing the existence and development of\nlive fuels during the wet and mild season (winter and\nearly spring) and the vegetation stress conditions during\nhot and dry seasons (late spring and summer). The two\nremaining clusters are associated with drier climates and\nmostly non-forested vegetation cover (Figure 5). Climate\nin the E_CLU is characterized by dry winters (with small\nexceptions in the Pyrenees) and by even dryer and hot\nsummers (AEMET-IM, 2011). The existence of meteo-\nrological favourable dry and hot conditions that promote\nthe occurrence of wildfires during the summer season\nis not supported by the existence of appropriate vegeta-\ntion cover, because this arid environment seriously lim-\nits the fuels availability (Pausas and Ferna?ndez-Mun?oz,\n2011). In fact, the cluster represented in light green in\nFigure 5 corresponds to areas with extremely low NDVI\nvalues (Figure 5 bottom panel), which is a typical of\nbare soil or very sparse vegetation. In this situation, and\neven with meteorological conditions that favour fire igni-\ntion, there is a very low probability of having large fire\nevents/activity. The SW_CLU region is characterized by\nextremely hot and dry summers but has a less homo-\ngeneous climate conditions during the mild and humid\nwinter, with a gradient of both temperature and precipi-\ntation in the NE \u2013 SW direction. Vegetation cover in this\narea is dominated by sparse vegetation, with a maximum\nof vegetation activity in spring (green in Figure 5) and\nrain feed crops that mature in late spring and early sum-\nmer (yellow in Figure 5).\n\n4. Modelling the inter-annual variability of BA\n\n4.1. The influence of previous climatic conditions\n\nAlthough fire ignition is most of the times dependent\non human activities (either by accident, negligence or\nintentionally) the probability of a fire ignition to grow\ninto a large and severe event is highly dependent on the\nexistence of the appropriate meteorological conditions\n(Pyne et al ., 1996). Nevertheless, besides the meteoro-\nlogical conditions at the time of the fire ignition, pre-\nvious climatic conditions play a very important role, as\nthey are directly related to soil dryness and vegetation\n\nhydric stress during the fire season. Some relations have\nbeen identified in specific regions, such as over Portugal\n(Pereira et al ., 2005; Trigo et al ., 2006; Hoinka et al .,\n2009), where besides the usual link between summer fires\nand previous months dryness and warmness, wet months\nin mid-spring also reveal to be related to more BA in\nthe fire season, as they promote the growth of vegetation\nwhich may act as fuel when fires are triggered. However,\nthe exact nature of these relations between appropriate\nprevious climatic conditions and BA varies from area to\narea and from season to season.\n\nTaking into account the similar fire regime within each\nof the four clusters defined in Section 3, and in order\nto assess the role of previous climatic conditions on\nthe inter-annual variability of BA, values of the Pearson\ncorrelation coefficient (R) between BA time series (not\nNBA) in each cluster and relevant antecedent climatic\nvariables (precipitation and temperature) over the region\nwere computed as a procedure to reduce the dimension-\nality and pre select predictors with greater potential. It\nshould be noted that BA and NBA present similar sea-\nsonal cycles, but the need of using NBA in the previous\nsection was related with the necessity of performing the\ncluster analysis using a more appropriate fire statistic\nthat facilitates the comparison among clusters (Figure 6)\nand the corresponding seasonal evolution (Figure 7). The\nCRU-TS3.0 mean monthly precipitation and temperature\ndataset were used to compute mean spatial average series\nfor each cluster domain, i.e. selecting all grid-points coin-\ncident with the area of the spatial configuration associated\nto each cluster depicted in Figure 6. Instead of using abso-\nlute values of climate variables to test their usefulness as\npredictors, the developed models will rely on monthly\nanomalies time series, computed by removing the long-\nterm mean from the spatially averaged monthly time\nseries in each cluster. This procedure does not change the\nPearson correlation coefficient but effectively removes\nthe annual cycle in order to retain time series of tem-\nperature and precipitation anomalies in each of the four\nIberian fire cluster regions. As it was seen in Section 2.3,\neach cluster presents a peak of BA at different timings\nof the year, or even two peaks during different seasons.\nBearing this in mind, eventual links between BA in those\npeak months and the time series of anomalous mete-\norological fields were checked from 2 to 7 months in\nadvance. For example, in order to study potential previ-\nous climatic influences for the August BA observed in\nthe NW_CLU, we tested the existence and statistical sig-\nnificance of Pearson correlation coefficients between this\nvariable and the meteorological monthly time series from\nJanuary to June. The highest values of R between each\nvariable and each BA cluster for the considered months\nare presented in Table II. No results are presented for\nN_CLU, as none of the tested R values were statistically\nsignificant at the 5% level.\n\nThese previous climatological variables can integrate\nthe pool of potential predictors and be used as predictors\nin statistical hindcast models of BA (hereafter CLI_mod-\nels).

For this purpose, a forward stepwise regression\nwas applied to the temperature and precipitation monthly\nanomaly time series, in order to reproduce BA monthly\ntime series for each cluster. This method tests all pos-\nsible predictors and selects the one that explain more\nvariance of the predictand (BA), and then looks for the\nmost relevant remaining predictors that surpass a pre-\ndefined level of statistical significance (here defined as\nthe 5% level). For the three clusters that present the main\npeaks of BA during summer months (e.g. NW_CLU,\nSW_CLU and E_CLU), three models were developed\nand tested to simulate the BA in (1) July, (2) August\nand (3) July + August. In the case of the N_CLU, which\npresents two BA peaks (in March and September) models\nfor those two specific periods were tested. Eventual prob-\nlems related to over fitting were mitigated by employ-\ning the always stringent cross-validation scheme, usually\nknown as the leave-one-out scheme (Wilks, 2006). In this\napproach, a single observation from the original sample\nis retained for validation, and the remaining observations\nare used as training data. Besides, all models were forced\nto retain four predictors at most. All these precautionary\nsteps were taken because the time series are only 22 years\nlong (1980 \u2013 2001, since WTC data was only available\nuntil 2001), and this implies that using a large number of\npredictors could be misleading.\n\nValues of the Pearson correlation coefficient between\nobserved and modelled (with CLI_models) BA time\nseries in each cluster for all these cases are summarized\nin Figure 8. These results reveal that the role played\nby previous climatic conditions diverges for the different\nclusters (Figure 8). Winter and spring climatic conditions\nplay an important role for the very active NW areas.\nAlthough we find modest R values between observed and\nmodelled BA time series for both July and August BA,\nR increases (to about 0.5) and surpasses the statistical\nsignificance level for the July + August BA. Results\nobtained for the SW_CLU and E_CLU show that pre-\nconditioning climatic predictors appear to be useful for\nestimating the BA in August, but not as clearly as\n\nfor July. For the N_CLU (not presented in Figure 8)\nwe did not obtain statistical models for any of the\nconsidered months, as none of the possible previous\nclimatic predictors were retained by selection method.\nThis result means that BA in March and September\nare not clearly associated to remote previous anomalous\nclimatic conditions in this cluster.\n\n4.2. Links with WT frequencies\n\nThe objective of this section (and the main motivation\nof this work) is to assess the performance of the WTC\nfrom the COST733 catalogue over the Iberia region in\nwhat respects to their capacity of discriminating weather\nconditions that favour the occurrence of large values of\nBA. The focus will be on the conditions in the months\nof occurrence of fires, or at the most, the previous one.\n\nEvery single day in the study period (1980 \u2013 2001) was\nclassified in one of the nine specific categories of each\nWTC. To make this information operational, monthly\nfrequencies of each category were computed for all WTC\nused in this study. Then, following the same approach\nused for the CLI_models, correlation analysis was used\nas a pre-selection procedure to identify the WTC most\nrelated with BA time series in each cluster.\n\nThe highest values of the Pearson correlation coef-\nficients between time series of BA in each cluster\nand monthly frequencies of each WT are presented in\nTable III. Taking into account that several classifications\npresent few significant values of R with BA time series,\nthe remaining of the analysis was restricted to the five\nmost promising WTC, namely: LUNDC09, NNWC09,\nPCACAC09, PETISCOC09 and WLKC09. This restric-\ntion is objective as it is solely based on the magni-\ntude of the statistical relationships observed between the\nBA in each cluster and the WT frequencies for certain\nclassifications.\n\nThe BA statistical models based on time series of\nmonthly frequencies of each WT (WTC_models) for\neach of the four clusters were developed following the\nsame approach used to developed the CLI_models (i.e. a\nforward stepwise predictor selection procedure, limited to\nretain at most four predictors and using cross-validation).\nThis approach will enable us to distinguish which of the\nconsidered five classifications tend to better reproduce\nthe appropriate classes of weather conditions that are\nrelated to months with high values of BA in Iberia. At\nthis stage, the climatic information from previous seasons\nwas neglected and we are only focused on the WTC\npredictors. Aiming to develop the best BA models and\nto assess the possible added value of incorporating both\ntypes of information (rather than using only WTC or\nonly previous meteorological data alone) a third type\nof hindcast models (TOT_models) was developed. In\nthis case, both classes of variables are integrated in\nthe potential pool of predictors used to construct the\nmodels and the remaining exact same procedures as in\nthe previous models are carried out.\n\nDespite the simplifications assumed previously (num-\nber of clusters retained, months to analyse and WTC kept\n\n? 2013 Royal Meteorological Society Int.

Thus, for the sake of\nsimplicity, we have summarized results in a simpler\ndisplay (Figure 9) of the Pearson correlation coefficient\nvalue between the observed and simulated BA time\nseries for all the tested models. For each cluster, classifi-\ncation and month, the plot includes two bars, the lighter\none (at front) representing the result achieved with the\nWTC_models and the darker one (at back) representing\nthe TOT_models, that incorporates both WTC and pre-\nvious climatic conditions as possible predictors. For this\nreason, the darker bar is only visible in the cases where\nTOT_models produce better models than WTC_models.\nThis representation simplifies the comparison between\n\nthe performances of all models, the assessment of the\nability of each WTC to describe the BA variability, and\nthe understanding to what extent (and for each cluster)\nprevious climatic data improves the results obtained\nfrom WTC predictors-based models. Several major\nresults emerge from the analysis of Figure 9, namely:\n\n(1) Higher values of R were obtained for both western\nsectors of Iberia (NW_CLU and SW_CLU), fact\nwhich suggest that it will be more susceptible to\nreconstruct BA series using this type of statistical\nmodels and predictors in these regions;\n\n(2) In general, TOT_models present higher performance\nthan the corresponding WTC_models and CLI_-\nmodels, which means that the use of both WTC\n\n? 2013 Royal Meteorological Society Int.

Values of the Pearson correlation coefficient (R) between\nobserved and modelled time series of monthly burnt areas in the\nnorthwest (NW_CLU), southwest (SW_CLU), east (E_CLU) and\nnorth (N_CLU) clusters of normalized burned area (NBA), using as\npredictors in light shaded bars just the WTC (WTC_models) and in dark\nshaded bars using both WTC and climatic variables (TOT_models).\nDark shaded bars are only visible whenever TOT_models present better\n\nperformance than WTC_models.\n\nand previous meteorological conditions as predic-\ntors provides an added value in the vast majority of\ncases.\n\nFor example, in the NW_CLU the value of the Pearson\ncorrelation coefficient for most of the models surpasses\nthe 5% significance line. In this region, good results\nare found for both July and August BA time series.\nNevertheless, the July + August models present the best\n\nperformance in NW_CLU (in three of the five tested\nWTC). In the SW_CLU, the month which models are\nmore able to reproduce BA variance varies according\nto the considered classifications. TOT_models present\nbetter results than CLI_models but, the main feature is\nthat the use of WTC as predictors improves substantially\nthe reconstruction of BA series in July, which was\nquite modest when using climatological information only.\nResults for August are slightly better but not statistically\nsignificant, showing that the wildfire climatology in\nSW_CLU and this month is essentially related to years\nwith propitious conditions cumulated in previous months.\nIn the E_CLU August BA models tend to present better\nresults (in four of the five classifications), while July\nmodels fall below the 5% level of statistical significance.\nAs no satisfying CLI_models were obtained for the\nN_CLU, we find the best TOT_models for this region\nto be equivalent to the best WTC_models. In this cluster,\nstatistically significant BA models were only obtained for\nSeptember.\n\nThe procedure for statistical validation of the models\nis not based solely on the Pearson correlation coefficient.\nThe Mean Absolute Error (MAE) has also been computed\nfor all models presented here. We found a good agreement\nbetween the results obtained with the two measures of\ngoodness of fit, for example, the higher the correlation\ncoefficients, the lower the MAE between observed and\nmodelled series (not shown).\n\nFinally, it is not an easy task to rank the best WTC\nclassifications for any cluster as it depends on the\ntarget month. However, PETISCOC09, WLKC09 and\nLUNDC09 can be considered the most satisfying for\nNW_CLU. It is also rather difficult to select the best per-\nforming classifications in the SW_CLU, but LUNDC09,\nPCACAC09 and PETISCOC09 may be considered to\nbe those that provide the best results on the overall.\nThe PETISCOC09, LUNDC09 and PCACAC09 classi-\nfications present the best results for the E_CLU. For\nthe N_CLU, the region with the poorest model perfor-\nmance, statistically significant models were only found\nfor September and with the WLKC09, LUNDC09 and\nPETISCOC09 WTC.\n\n5. Synoptic analysis\n\nIt was shown in the previous section that the statisti-\ncal models (TOT_models) which combine prior climatic\ninformation (temperature and precipitation anomalies)\nand non-lagged WTC series usually present better perfor-\nmance, when reconstructing the inter-annual variability\nof BA series of Iberia, particularly in the most affected\nwestern sectors. To have a further understanding on the\nrole that the latter predictors have on these models, the\nmean sea level pressure anomaly composite fields of\nthe retained classes for each model in each cluster were\nanalysed in more detail. Once again, taking into account\nthe considerably large number of models and predictors,\nwe opted to summarize results in a concise way (Figure\n\n? 2013 Royal Meteorological Society Int. J. Climatol. (2013)\n\n\n\nR. M. TRIGO et al.\n\nFigure 10. Composites of surface pressure anomaly (2 hPa interval isolines, with dashed lines corresponding to positive anomalies) in months\n(lower central box) with higher values of BA in each cluster (lower left box) and for specific weather type classifications (lower right box) that\nare highly correlated with BA series. Black arrows represent the anomalous wind direction in the respective cluster, revealing the origin and\n\ncharacteristics of the advected air masses.\n\n10). The shown composites characterize the typical syn-\noptic configurations driving the main surface wind flow\nand heat advection that predominate during months with\nvery high values of BA in each cluster.\n\nThe majority of the retained classes correspond to\nvery similar synoptic configurations, independently of the\nWTC. In all cases, and as expected, the composites reveal\natmospheric anti-cyclonic circulation patterns usually\nassociated with stable and dry conditions. The obtained\nspatial configurations foster prevailing warm and dry\nwinds from inland, rather than moist and cool air\nadvection from the sea, either from the Atlantic Ocean\nor the Mediterranean. The main difference between the\nresults for each cluster can be found in the location of the\nhigh-pressure region, which induces different directions\n\nof the surface wind flow. This type of circulation\nis clearly evident in the composites identified when\nanalysing the most coastal confined clusters (NW, N and\nE). In the NW_CLU of Iberia, we find that hazardous\nfire seasons are related to WTs with prevailing winds\nfrom the east or southeast components. The composite\nof surface pressure anomaly obtained for the NW_CLU\n(Figure 10) is very similar to the spatial pattern obtained\nfor the sea level air pressure composite for the 10%\nhighest BA days in Portugal and the corresponding\n10% anomaly for the 1980 \u2013 2000 period (Pereira et al .,\n2005). The Mediterranean areas that compose the E_CLU\npresent important fire episodes when the circulation is\nessentially from the northwest (Figure 10). Regions from\nthe N_CLU have fire incidence with dominating southeast\n\n? 2013 Royal Meteorological Society Int. J. Climatol. (2013)\n\n\n\nMODELLING WILDFIRE ACTIVITY IN IBERIA\n\nor east winds. In this latter case, and in particular\nfor coastal areas, it is also quite evident that besides\nbeing an inland wind, it is also a downslope wind from\nthe Cantabria mountainous region towards the coast,\npromoting additional drying and warming of air masses\n(Foehn effect). This is also the process that helps to\nunderstand the obtained results for the SW_CLU, where\nthe anomalous composites point to prevailing winds from\nthe north or northwest components. It should be reminded\nthat in this cluster the highest values of the NBA are\nfound for some ARs of Portugal (namely Guarda, Castelo\nBranco and Santare?m), which are located downstream of\nthe main orographic barriers in that domain. It should also\nbe kept in mind that this cluster covers a much wider area\nof the peninsula (Figure 6), comprehending not only the\nreferred Portuguese AR but also a large part of central\nand southern Spain, where NBA values are generally low.\nThe wide structure of this cluster may partially explain\nthe absence of a clearly inland originated wind patterns\nin the presented composite.\n\n6. Discussion and conclusions\n\nIn this work, a comprehensive and novel wildfire database\nfor the entire IP was established by merging informa-\ntion from both Iberian countries which is essential for\nstudying spatial and temporal patterns of fire occurrences\nand BAs in Iberia. Moreover, such a database can be\nuseful for further developments on a wider European con-\ntext. Using this Iberian dataset, we were able to perform\na cluster analysis to distinguish between different sub-\nregions with similar monthly fire regimes within the IP.\nThis analysis proved to be efficient in discriminating four\nindependent regions, as they differ both on the timing\nand intensity of the seasonal peaks of NBA. The analy-\nsis of the mean annual cycle of NBA clearly highlights\nthe western half of Iberia as more prone to large wild-\nfire activity, particularly in central and northern areas of\nPortugal and northwestern areas of Spain. Paradoxically,\nbeing neither the driest nor the most irregular region in\nterms of rainfall in the Iberian context, the exceptional\nhigh frequency of forest fires in NW_CLU denotes the\nrelevant role of a combination of weather-climate, vegeta-\ntion, geographical and human factors upon fire dynamics.\nSome northeastern areas of Spain also present relevant\nmean annual values of NBA, but generally at a smaller\nmagnitude than the previous. This fact leads us to pay\nparticular attention to the results and statistical models\nof westernmost clusters. In fact the relatively low values\nof NBA found in the other clusters reduce the possi-\nbility of a deeper analysis, and increase the danger of\nmisinterpretation of the results and of the efficiency of\nthe tested statistical models. As expected, the highest\nmean monthly values of NBA area were found in sum-\nmer months, as higher temperatures and lower humidity\nfoster appropriate conditions for fire ignitions. Western-\nmost regions tend to present higher mean values of NBA\n\nin the month of August, while areas along the Mediter-\nranean basin present a peak in July. Northern areas\n(both N_CLU and NW_CLU) have two annual peaks,\none in summer and one in late winter or early spring.\nWhile in the NW_CLU this cold season peak is almost\ninsignificant when compared to the summer peak, in the\nregions around Cantabria and Asturias both peaks are\ncomparable, although of relatively small amplitude.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to undertake an objec-\ntive comparison between the ability of different WTC\navailable from the COST733 project, in terms of discrim-\ninating the synoptic conditions that favour large wildfire\nactivity in Iberia. This was done for classifications with\nnine classes, and the procedure includes: (1) correlation\nanalysis between monthly BA and the monthly frequen-\ncies of each WT, used as a predictor pre-selection tool;\nfollowed by a (2) regression analysis to derive statisti-\ncal hindcast models of monthly BA (WTC_models) for\nall the clusters, and testing their ability to reproduce the\ninter-annual variability of the observed series. Similar\napproaches were adopted in previous studies in many\ndifferent areas (Pereira et al , 2011b). To avoid multi-\ncolinearity, in ecological modelling studies it is common\nto adopt two criteria: (i) pairwise correlation using Spear-\nman\u2019s or Pearson\u2019s R correlation coefficient between pre-\ndictors lower than given thresholds, e.g. 0.7 (Elith et al .,\n2006; Wisz and Guisan, 2009); and (ii) Generalized Vari-\nance Inflation Factor (GVIF) lower than 5 (Neter et al .,\n1996). In this study, R between every pair of predictors\nwas less or equal 0.5, while GVIF computed with SAM\n(Rangel et al ., 2010) was always less than 2.\n\nTo contextualize this modelling approach, models\nbased solely on climatic information from the pre-fire\nseason (CLI_models) were initially developed in order to\ncompare the results obtained with both models. This pro-\ncedure enabled us to distinguish between regions of the IP\nwhere pre-fire season temperature and precipitation play\nan important role on the magnitude of the fire season,\nand areas where this information has relatively low pre-\ndictability value. Summer large wildfire activity is highly\nrelated to previous climatic conditions in the northwestern\nsector of Iberia. This result is in agreement with the previ-\nous work by Pereira et al . (2005), which states that spring\nconditions are determinant on the propensity for large val-\nues of BA during the warmest months, mainly by (1) the\nlevel of dryness imposed by previous climatic conditions\nand (2) the rate of vegetation growth in spring, which\nleads to an additional fuel accumulation during summer\nextreme warm episodes. We have attempted to use other\nvariables related with the pre-fire season climate, such\nas the Palmer Drought Standardized Index (PDSI), how-\never, this has not improved the quality of the models,\nbeing rejected during the stepwise regression procedure.\n\nA third set of statistical models was computed using\nboth referred types of information as potential predictors\n(TOT_models). This was done in order to see the\nadded value of merging WTC and previous climatic\nconditions information. It should be stressed that all\nmodels were cross-validated to avoid over fitting. As\n\n? 2013 Royal Meteorological Society Int. J. Climatol. (2013)\n\n\n\nR. M. TRIGO et al.\n\nexpected, in almost all cases, best results were obtained\nfor the TOT_models. The larger improvements were\nfound for months and clusters where CLI_models results\nwere poorer. In northwestern areas, previous climatic\nconditions information was already sufficient to produce\nquite robust hindcast models. The difference in the\npredictability of BA amid different areas is quite evident\nin the correlation coefficient and MAE between hindcast\nand observed time series. Overall, we found the most\nrobust statistical hindcast models for the NW_CLU (the\none with the highest mean annual values of NBA), and\nthe worst performing models in the N_CLU (the one with\nthe lowest mean annual values of NBA and with two\nsimilar sized peaks in March and September).\n\nThere is no clear or consensual result pointing to\none particular WTC that performs better on the purpose\nof modelling BA time series in all Iberian regions.\nDepending on the considered region and month, the\nbest performing classification change. However, some\nof the tested classifications tend to present the best\nresults more frequently: PETISCOC09, WLKC09 and\nLUNDC09. Each of these WTC presents some of the\nmost satisfying results in at least two clusters, while other\nclassifications do not present good performances in none\nof the considered regions and months that were analysed\nand were therefore discarded from the remaining of the\nanalysis. In the western sectors of Iberia (NW_CLU and\nSW_CLU), several WTC used alone are sufficient to\ndeveloped statistical significance models at the 5% level.\nIn these clusters, the variance of July BA time series\nis less explained by previous climatic conditions alone\nthan in August or July + August BA time series, but\nthere was a significant gain by introducing current WTC\ninformation. This difference between July and August\nmodels might result from the fact that the ignition of\na fire in the middle of August does not always require\nan extreme \u2018synoptic forcing\u2019, due to the accumulation\nof previous hot and dry spells, while earlier in July\na large fire might require a more intense \u2018synoptic\nforcing\u2019 to be initiated. In the Mediterranean coastal\nareas, BA in July was also difficult to model based\npurely on previous climatological conditions, and in this\nparticular case, the WTC information does not improve\nsignificantly the models \u2014 only the BA in August and\nin July + August time series can be well reproduced\nby these statistical models. A study by Milla?n et al .\n(1998) suggests that in this region, early summer fire\nactivity is highly related to the penetration of sea breezes\ninland, during well established warm and dry conditions\nin the interior, while in late summer westerly dry and\nwarm inland flows (Poniente) play a more important\nrole. This fact may provide some context for the poor\nresults obtained with the models of BA in July, as sea\nbreezes occur frequently at the mesoscale (i.e. at a finer\nresolution than the considered datasets in this work),\nwhile the Poniente conditions can be well represented\nat the synoptic scale. Models for the northernmost\nregions present the worst results even when both types\nof information are used as predictors, although some\n\nfew WTC can present interesting results. Three possible\nfacts might help to explain such regional discrepancies:\n(1) the low performance of the N_CLU and E_CLU\nmodels might result from an insufficient level of spatial\naggregation to solve the climatological and topographical\ncomplexity of both regions; (2) the reliability of the\nseasonal models is reduced, as the BA in the NW_CLU\nreveals to be a consequence of a large number of \u2018small\u2019\nfires, while when we move to the southeast most of the\nBA rests on a few large forest fires; (3) as a response\nof such level of complexity, atmospheric mechanisms\nmight combine themselves in a nonlinear way, sometimes\nreinforcing the total forcing, sometimes weakening it. In\nany case, the analysis of those facts is beyond the scope\nof this paper.\n\nIt was also important to assure that WT predictors\nwhich were retained by the selection method corre-\nsponded to synoptic patterns associated with large wild-\nfire activity episodes. The composites for the majority of\nWTs that were retained as predictors for each cluster cor-\nrespond to stable conditions, where the specific region is\ninfluenced by warm and dry air masses. The atmospheric\nprocesses that could enhance the susceptibility for large\nBA are associated to either the advection of hot and dry\ninland air to coastal regions, or diabatic heating and dry-\ning on the downslope side of the mountainous systems.\n\nOn the overall, and despite being almost impossible\nto identify the WTC more suitable to discriminate BA\nin Iberia, it is quite clear that their information is very\nuseful and valuable enough to develop statistical models\nthat can explain the variability of BA in this region.\nIn fact, instead of picking and focusing on one or two\nparticular classifications a priori , we find a more efficient\ntype of approach to take them all initially into account,\nand use objective criteria and automatic methods to\nselect the classifications with better performance in each\nparticular case.\n\nRegionalized scenarios of climate change for Spain\n(MARN, 2005; AEMET-IM, 2011) and Portugal show\na sustained warming (Ramos et al ., 2011) and a reduc-\ntion of the precipitation (Gouveia et al ., 2011), more\nremarkable during spring, outcome of the reduction of\nAtlantic storm systems (Lorenzo et al ., 2011). Conse-\nquently, the overall increase of the fire risk associated to\na warmer world should be enhanced in western Iberia due\nto the long-term reduction of the springtime precipitation.\nThe good performance of models in this region offers a\npromising tool to simulate the BA amount from the out-\nputs of the regional climate models. Finally, we must\nacknowledge the fact that some of the Iberian regions\ncharacterized in this work might be affected by the exis-\ntence of asymmetric trends in BA annual values. In par-\nticular, it has been shown that Spain reveals a negative\ntrend of BA in the last three decades while Portugal has\nnot revealed such pattern, being more appropriately char-\nacterized by an increasing tendency between the 1980s\nand 2000s (Pereira et al ., 2011a).\n\n? 2013 Royal Meteorological Society Int.
