Sendo a energia essencial ao bem-estar da popula\u00e7\u00e3o e ao \n\ndesenvolvimento da sociedade, produzir e utilizar energia de forma sustent\u00e1vel \u00e9 vital para a \n\nhumanidade. Por\u00e9m, a depend\u00eancia de combust\u00edveis foss\u00e9is \u00e9 demasiado elevada e sendo esta \n\numa fonte limitada na natureza, \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio contrariar o seu uso nos diversos setores. Na \n\nInd\u00fastria Aeroespacial a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de pain\u00e9is solares \u00e9 uma alternativa execut\u00e1vel. \n\nEsta Disserta\u00e7\u00e3o de Mestrado inclui um plano concetual de um sistema propulsivo el\u00e9trico, \n\ndestinado a um UAV com uma envergadura de 4,5 m e um peso de aproximadamente 52 N. A \n\nconstru\u00e7\u00e3o deste sistema \u00e9 particularmente diferente dos m\u00e9todos convencionais de propuls\u00e3o, \n\npelo que o seu projeto e dimensionamento dependem especialmente da energia dispon\u00edvel \n\narmazenada na bateria, e da pot\u00eancia gerada pelos pain\u00e9is solares. \n\nDevido \u00e0 varia\u00e7\u00e3o da intensidade de radia\u00e7\u00e3o solar em diferentes zonas do pa\u00eds e do ano, foi \n\nelaborado um plano de testes experimentais para verificar a viabilidade do sistema.

However, dependence on fossil fuel is awfully high and it is necessary to hinder \n\ntheir use in several industries as it is a limited resource. In the Aeroespace Industry solar \n\nenergy has been gaining widespread development, becoming the solution to many negative \n\nfactors.  \nThis Master Thesis includes a conceptual design of an electric propulsion system for a UAV with \n\na wingspan of 4.5 m and a weight of approximately 52 N. The construction of this system is \n\ndifferent from conventional propulsion methods, so the design and sizing rely on the available \n\nenergy stored in the battery and the power generated by the solar panels. As solar radiation is \n\ndifferent throughout the year, a plan for experimental tests was drafted to verify the system \n\nviability. Experiments show that exact azimuth orientation is not critical, vertical axis given by \n\npitch and roll, have a more important effect on performance. Although it is a small aircraft, \n\nthe wing beyond its aerodynamics function, has a proper zone where solar cells should be \n\nplaced. Appealing to a second order differentiation it is possible to determine that solar panels \n\nshould be placed at 1.5 cm from the trailing edge affecting as little as possible the airfoil. \nA mission simulation was done to understand the propulsion system feasibility. Although, the \n\neight hour sustainable-flight was not possible to replicate the motor still ran for 5 hours, being \n\nthe battery charged during cruise phase as pretended.  Therefore, proper solar cells placement, \n\ndevelopment of a mounting method and electrical circuit design are carried out in order to \n\nallow the UAV to achieve a sustainable-flight. \n\n \n\n

In the Aerospace industry, this is the key to many negative factors such as \n\nenvironmental pollution, noise and the dependence of fuel witch is a limited resource in \n\nnature.  \n\nThe main motivation comes from the environmental challenges that the planet is going \n\nthrough. Since global warming until the lack of natural resources. The commercial aircraft \n\ntoday use a large amount of fuel which has a negative impact on the atmosphere due to \n\nrelease of carbon. One way to solve this problem would be to eliminate fossil fuels and finding \n\nan alternative, as hydrogen or biofuels, however that may also be depleted over time. Thus, \n\na propulsion system using solar energy not only can be successful, as may also be the future \n\nand the solution to all the environmental problems in aviation. \n\n1.2 Objectives  \n\nInitially it is necessary to select the type of mission and the energy requirements that are \n\nneeded. Once the mission is chosen it follows the design propulsion system with all the details \n\nto achieve a sucessful mission. So the leading goal is to project a propulsion system that \n\nprovide a sustainable-flight.The requirements include:  \n\n1. Definition of the propulsion system architecture; \n\n2. Size photovoltaic cells and solar arrays; \n\n3. Desgin an attachament system for the solar panels; \n\n4. Design and assemble the electronic circuit. \n\n5. Develop a solar panel experiments guideline; \n\n6. Assemble the system.  \n\n \n\n1.3 Structure of the Document \n\nThis master thesis first starts with a theoretical background related to the main work done, \n\nwhere a brief history of solar-powered aircraft is discussed as well as other UAV studies.It \n\nthen continues with the specification of the mission and the necessary energy requirements \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\nto provide a sustainable-flight. Once the mission and the energy requirements are selected it \n\nfollows the Propulsion System Architecture, in which, each different component of the solar \n\npowered system is described. On a following stage, it is studied the appropriate position of \n\nthe solar cells on the wing and a found a method to mount them. \n\n As it is expected, solar radition is different throughout the year, for this reason some \n\nexperimental tests are conducted and reported. The results from the experiments are then \n\ncompared with solar cells values concebed in a laboratory environment. This chapter enable \n\nto determine the solar cells efficiency and validate the propulsion system.  \n\nTo finish, the conclusions will be stated at the end of this document as well as some \n\nconsiderations about future work. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\nChapter 2 \n\n \n\nState-of-art \n\nThe achievement of a solar powered aircraft capable of continuous flight was still a dream \n\nsome years ago, but this great challenge has become feasible today. In fact, significant \n\nprogresses have been realized recently in the domains of flexible solar cells and high energy \n\ndensity batteries. In this section, a brief history of solar-powered aircraft will be discused, as \n\nwell as other UAV studies that have been done over the last 40 years.To understand the history \n\nof solar- powered flight, a discussion of solar cells is also required.  \n\n2.1 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle \n\nAccording to the Department of Defense of the United States of America1 an unmanned \n\naerial vehicle is defined \u201cas powered, aerial vehicles that do not carry a human operator, \n\nuse aerodynamic forces to provide vehicle lift, can fly autonomously or be piloted remotely, \n\ncan be expendable or recoverable, and can carry a lethal or nonlethal payload. Ballistic or \n\nsemi-ballistic vehicles, cruise missiles, and artillery projectiles are not considered UAV by \n\nthe DOD definition. UAVs are either described as a single air vehicle (with associated \n\nsurveillance sensors), or a UAV system, which usually consists of three to six air vehicles, a \n\nground control station, and support equipment.\u201d \n\n2.2 Solar Energy \n\nThe most plenteous energy resource that exists in the world is Solar Energy. Surely, the fee \n\nat which solar energy interceps the Earth is about 10,000 2  times greater than the speed at \n\nwhich the humankind uses energy. Although not all countries are equally gifted with solar \n\nenergy, it is possible for nearly all, a meaningful contribution from a combination of energy \n\nfrom direct solar radiation. The conversion of solar energy is a large family of different \n\ntechnologies to please a range of needs for energy services. Solar technologies can provide \n\nheating, cooling, natural lighting and electricity for a variety of applications. \n\n2.2.1 The Photovoltaic Effect  \n\nOn 1839 a french physicist first observed the physical phenomenon responsible for \n\nconverting light to electricity, his name was Edmund Becquerel. He noted that a voltage \n\nacted when one of two indentical electrodes in a weak conducting solution was \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nilluminanetd. The PV effect was primarily studied in solids, such as selenium (1). Selenium \n\nis capable to convert light in the visible part of the sun\u2019s spectrum and for then quickly \n\nadopeted by the then-emerging field of light- measuring devices.  Selenium cells cost is \n\ntoo high relative to the insignificant amount of power they produce so they have never \n\nbecome pratical as energy converters. Meanwhile, work on the physics of PV effect has \n\nexpanded and a main step forward in solar-cell technology took place on 1940 when the \n\nCZ (for more information go to Annex Appendix A) technique was developed for \n\nproducing highly pure crystalline silicon.  \n\nAccording to \u201cBasic Photovoltaic Principles and Methods\u201d 3, \u201cthe Photovoltaic effect is \n\nthe basic of conversion of light to electricity in photovoltaic or solar cells.Described \n\nsimply, the PV effect is as follows: Light, which is pure energy enters a PV cell and \n\nimparts enough energy to some electrons (negatively charged atomic particles) to free \n\nthem. A built-in-potencial barrier in the cell acts on these electrons to produce a voltage \n\n(the so-called photovoltage), which can be used to drive a current through a circuit\u201d as \n\ncan be seen on Figure 2.1.    \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1- Photovoltaic Solar Panel Working Principle 4. \n\n \n  \n\n                                                 \n(1) Selenium \u2013 a nonmetallic element chemically resembling sulfur and tellurium, occurring in several allotropic forms, \n\nas crystalline and amorphous, and having an electrical resistance that varies under the influence of light. Symbol: \n\nSe; atomic weight: 78.96; atomic number: 34. \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nCharge carriers like electrons and holes are generated when sulingh raids a solar cell. \n\nThe holes are drawn into the positive, p-layer, and the electrons are drawn into the \n\nnegative,n-layer, both are separated by the internal fild produced by junction. When a \n\ncircuit is made, the free electrons have to get through the load to recombine with the \n\npositive holes, thus producing current from the cells under illumination.  \n\n \n\n2.2.3 Photovoltaics Industry \n\nThe PV industry is rising, with rates of 30 % 5 per year over the last decade. This progresss \n\nhas been determined by the market development programs to accelerate the deployment \n\nof sustainable energy options and rapidly increasing fossil fuel prices.This proves, if need \n\nbe, that solar photovoltaics is on the way to becoming a major part of the eletricity system, \n\ndelivering clean, safe and affordable energy to the greater number all around the globe.  \n\n2.2.3.1 Solar Cells Evolution \n\na)  1st  Generation Solar Cells ,  Crystalline Silicon PV techonolgy (c-Si) \n\nSilicon-based technology is the leading technology in the commercial production of solar \n\ncells, accounting for about 85% of the solar cell market. It is technically proven and has \n\nsucceed in achieving market penetration, primarily in off-grid remote areas and lately in \n\ngrid-connected applications. There are however, several limitations to this 1st generation \n\ntechnology from the onset. Silicon wafers are very fragile and the process involved in the \n\nmanufacturing is difficult and labor intensive, therefore high cost. There are two types \n\nof crystalline, or wafer-based silicon PV: monocrystalline and multicrystalline. \n\nMonocrystalline semiconductor wafers are cut from single-crystal silicon ingots. \n\nMulticrystalline semiconductor wafers are cut from directionally solidified blocks or \n\ngrown in thin sheets. Monocrystalline ingots are more difficult, energy intensive, and \n\nexpensive to grow than simple blocks of multicrystalline silicon. However, \n\nmonocrystalline silicon produces higher- efficiency cells.  \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2- Production process for typical crystalline silicon solar cells 6. \n\nThe rated efficiencies of standard c-Si PV modules are about 14 % to 16 % for commercial \n\nscale and module efficiencies of about 17 % to 21 % for a laboratory scale 7. \n\nb) 2nd Generation solar cells : Thin-Film technology solar cells  \n\nIn order to cut down the manufacturing costs, thin-film solar cells appear as alternatives. \n\nThe technology earns from the low processing temperature. Thin-film PV cells consist of \n\na semiconductor layer a few microns (\u00b5?) of thickness, which is about 100 times thinner \n\nthan current ?\u2013 ?? cells. Most thin films are direct bandgap semiconductors, which means \n\nthey are capable of absorving energy contained in sunlight with a much thinner layer \n\nthan traditional ?\u2013 ?? PV. The most common thin-film semiconductor materials are ????, \n\n?\u2013 ?? and ????.  \n\nThe main disadvantage of ?\u2013 ?? solar cell is the degration of their performance under \n\nlight exposure over time. Another notable concept of ?\u2013 ?? solar cells is hydrogenated \n\namorphous silicon ?\u2013 ??: ?combined with microcrystalline silicon \u00b5? ? ??: ? forming the \n\nmulti-junction thin-film silicon solar cell.  The advantage of \u00b5? ? ??: ? is that it absorbs \n\nlight from the red and near infrared part of the spectrum, thus increasing the \n\nefficiency.The potential drawbacks of ???? and ???? solar cells are materials availability \n\nfor long-term use and issues with toxicity (????) and mass production has been proven \n\nto be difficult (????). The efficiency of the second generation solar cells varies from 11% \n\nto 20 % for laboratory scale and 9 % to 12 % for commercial scale7. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nc) 3rd Generation solar cells \n\nResearch for improving solar cell performance by enhancing its efficiency has led to \n\nthe development of the third generation solar cells. Dye-sensitized solar cells use dye \n\nmolecules absorbed onto a nanostructured substrate and immersed in a liquid to \n\nabsorb solar radiation and have demonstrated laboratory efficiencies as high as \n\n11.1 %. OPV solar cells, established on polymers or small molecules with \n\nsemiconductor properties, have demonstrated laboratory cell efficiencies above 8 %. \n\nOrganic modules have the potential for low-cost manufacturing using existing printing \n\nand lamination technologies.  \n\nThere are significant challenges to the commercialization of solution-processed \n\norganic solar cells and dye-sensitized, due to the stability of the materials against \n\noxygen and water ingress. This limits the lifetime of these devices to anywhere from \n\na few hundred hours to 2 years. This issue is being addressed through efforts to \n\ndevelop improved, yet cost-effective, encapsulants. In addition, organic and dye-\n\nsensitized solar cells use dyes that have been shown to degrade when put in direct \n\nsunlight for long periods of time, a significant issue to have in a solar cell7. \n\n \n\nd) Concentrating PV \n\nCPV uses mirros or lenses made out of low-priced materials such as glass, steel, and \n\nplastic to focus sunlight onto a relatively small semiconductor area. This technique \n\nhave several significant advantages. First, it reduces the amount of active \n\nsemiconductor material needed to produce a given amount of electricity. On an area \n\nbasis, the active semiconductor material is the most complex and expensive \n\ncomponent of many PV modules; this is particularly true for MJ cells. MJ cells are \n\ncapable of much higher efficiencies than single junction silicon or thin-film cells. \n\nThis is because each junction of a MJ cell is designed to collect a different part of \n\nthe solar spectrum: MJ cells are typically a load of three different cells on top of one \n\nanother. This higher efficiency comes at an increase in manufacturing cost, and thus \n\nMJ devices are too expensive to use in terrestrial applications without concentration. \n\nThe downside to CPV, especially for higher concentration levels, is that, in order to \n\nmaintain the concentration of sunlight on the cell, the module must accurately follow \n\nthe sun throughout the day. Tracing results in a more complex and expensive \n\ninstallation. Recent improvements to MJ PV cells have produced cell efficiencies of \n\n43.5 % in the laboratory7. \n\n  \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\n2.4 NREL\u2019s world wide best research in laboratory \n\nThe Chart shown on figure 1, summarizes the world wide research effort over the last 40 \n\nyears. These solar cells are concebed in a laboratory environment and their area is not \n\noften larger than 1 square centimeter. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3- World Wide Best Research cell efficiencies over the last 40 years in laboratory 8.  \n\nThe devices included in this plot have efficiencies that are confirmed by independent, \n\nrecognized test laboratories and are reported on a standardized basis. The measurements for \n\nnew entries must be according to standard test or reporting conditions (STC).  As can be seen \n\non Figure 2.2, cell efficiency results are provided with diferents families of semiconductors \n\nas well as some 26 different subcategories. These diferents familes of semiconductors are \n\nindicated by distinctive colored symbols.  The purple colored, Multijunction and Single \n\nGallium Arsenide cells markers, represents the III-V technology (a combination of group III and \n\ngroup V, called III-V semiconductors), based on single, double and triple junctions and have \n\nefficiencies ranging from 26 % up to 44 % under concentrated light conditions.  The blue lines \n\nand dots represente the crystalline silicon technology based on monocrystalline and \n\nmulticrystalline silicon which record efficiencies range from 20.4 % to 27.6 %.  The inorganic \n\nthin-film techonologies, like thin-film silicon, ???? and ???? are indicated by the green \n\nmarkers and their record effiencies range from 13.4 % up to 20 %.  The red colored lines and \n\nmarkers indicats the emerging PV techonologies like organic solar cells.  It is necessary to \n\ntake into account that these are laboratory results of a very small area of solar cells and this \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nchart does not tells us anything of the long term stability of some PV techonologies, certainly \n\nnot the one indicated in red9. \n\n \n\n2.5 History of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles  \n\nThe first aircraft flight powered by a solar propulsion system took place on the 4th of \n\nNovember 1974 at Camp Irwin in California. Sunrise I, flew 20 minutes at an altitude of 100 \n\nm throughout its inaugural flight. It had a wingspan of 9.76 m, weight of 12.25 kg and a \n\npower output of 450 W from 4096 solar cells .Regrettably, Sunrise I was seriously damaged \n\nwhen caught flying in a sand storm. An improved version, Sunrise II, was built and tested on \n\nthe 12th of September 1975. With an equivalent wingspan, its weight was reduced to 10.21 kg \n\nand the 4480 solar cells were capable of delivering 600 W. After many weeks of testing, this \n\nsecond version was also damaged due to a failure in the command and control system. \n\nDespite all, the history of solar flight was engaged and its first demonstration was done10. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.4- Sunrise II, 1975 11. \n\nHigh Altitude Long Endurance Platforms and Eternal flight \n\nThe US government gave funding to AeroVironment Inc. to study the feasibility of long \n\nendurance solar electric flight above 19 000 km. As a result they patronized the Pathfinder \n\nproject which accomplished it first flight at Dryden in 1993. When funding for this program \n\nended, the 30 m wingspan and 254 kg aircraft became a part of NASA\u2019s ERAST program that \n\nstarted in 1994. In 1995, he exceeded Solar Challenger\u2019s altitude record for solar-powered \n\naircraft when it reached 15 392 m and two years later he set the record to 21 802 m. In \n\n1998, Pathfinder was modified into a new version, Pathfinder Plus, which had a bigger \n\nwingspan and new solar aerodynamic propulsion and system technologies. The main \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\nobjective was to validate these new elements before building its successor, the Centurion \n\n10. \n\n \n\n \n \n      Figure 2.5- Pathfinder in Flight over Hawaii 12.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n       Figure 2.6- Pahtfinder- Plus in flight over Hawaii13.  \n\nCenturion, which had a double wingspan compared to Pathfinder, was conceived to perform \n\na flight powered by solar energy that coud stay airborne for weeks or months. Its goal was \n\nto achieve scientific sampling and imaging missions or serving as telecommunications relay \n\nplatforms. It was capable to transport 45 kg of remote sensing and data collection \n\ninstruments for use in scientific studies and also 270 kg of sensors, telecommunications and \n\nimaging equipment that could go up to 24 400 m of altitude.It would also have a lithium \n\nbattery that could provide enough energy for two going up to five hours flight after sunset, \n\nbut insufficient to fly whole night. 10 \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.7- Centurion, 1997-1999 14.  \n\nHelios was the last prototype built. For NASA, the two main objectives were to demonstrate \n\nsustained flight at an altitude near 30 480 m  and a continued flight for at least 24 hours, \n\nincluding  14 hours above 15240 m, at least. In 2001, Helios achieved the first goal near \n\nHawaii with an unofficial world-record altitude of 29 524 m and a 40 minutes flight above \n\n29 261 m. But unfortunately, it never reached the second objective as it was destroyed when \n\nit fell into the Pacific Ocean on June 26, 2003 due to structural failures10.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.8- Helios, 1999-2003 15.   \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nThe Official World Record time for longest duration Unmanned Flight  \n\nTwo Zephyr aircrafts were first trialed in New Mexico in December 2005 by a British company \n\ncalled QinetiQ, achieving a maximum duration of 6 hours and reaching an altitude of 7 \n\n925 m. After an 18 hours of flight in July 2006, one of the aicrafts developed by QinetiQ \n\nexceeded the official world record time for the longest duration unmanned flight with a 54 \n\nhour flight in New Mexico on the 10th of September 2007, reaching a maximum altitude of \n\n17 786 m. Weighting only 30 kg for 18 m wingspan, the aircraft used solar power for the \n\nascent, reverting to lithiumsulphur battery power as dusk fell. QinetiQ expects in the future \n\nflight duration of some months at an altitude above 15 240 m16. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.9- Zephyr 7, 2010 17.  \n\nA Remarkable Project  \n\nOne of the most remarkables projects of solar energy is Solar Impulse, which is a long range \n\nsolar powered aircraft manned. It is headed by Bertrand Piccard, who co-piloted the first \n\nballoon to circle the world non-stop, and Andr\u00e9 Borschberg.  \n\nAccording to Solar Impulse \u201cThe goal of the project is to fly around the world with zero \n\nfuel. This challenge will be undertaken by Solar Impulse\u2019s second generation aircraft, HB-\n\nSIB, which is currently under construction. It will be fully assembled in the spring of 2014 \n\nand will fly around the world a year later.\u201d  \n\nThe first Flight was executed on 2010 and at the same year they reached a long-duration \n\nflight of 26 hours, 10 minutes and 19 secondes. Solar Impulse in its inaugural flight \n\naccomplished three record: maximum altitude, endurance and gain height, 9235 m, \n\n26h10m19s, 8744 m, respectively. The second Solar Impulse, HB-SIB construction started on \n\n2011 and first flown on 2014. As Andr\u00e9 Borschberg said \"It is the first aircraft which will have \n\nalmost unlimited endurance.\u201d The wingspan would be 72 m, it would carry 17, 000 solar \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\ncells that supply four electric motors and achieved an altitude of 5,500 m. The average \n\nground speed was 56 km/h18. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.10 \u2013 Solar Impulse 2 in Abu Dhabi 19.  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\nChapter 3 \n\n \n\nAircraft Description and Mission \n\nThis chapter first starts with the description of the aircraft mission and vehicle \n\ncharacterization, ending with a brief introduction to the non-conventional propulsion system \n\npowered by solar energy. The material presented here is part of a cooperative research \n\nproject involving tree research units that belong to the line of Aeronautics and Space of LAETA \n\n(2), namely CCTAE (3), AEROG (4) and IDMEC (5).  \n\n3.1 Solar UAV Mission \n\nThe LEEUAV project aims to develop a Long Endurance Electric Unammaned Aerial Vehicle \n\npowered by solar energy that must be as light as possible and be able to carry a payload of 1 \n\nkg. UAVs are slighty more cost effective to acquire and operate than conventional manned \n\naircraft, so the objective of this project is to create a reasonable cost platform that can be \n\nhandly installed in areas with small space. The aircraft has to be able to collect and store \n\nenergy for long endurance flight. The mission profile may be summarized as follows: \n\n1. Take-off in a very short distance ( in 8 m) or Launched by hand (in 3 m); \n\n2. Climb to 1000 m above ground level for a cruise altitude, in 10 minutes; \n\n3. Sustainable-flight  of 8 hours at equinox with a flight cruise speed of no less than 7 m/s; \n\n4. Descend from cruise altitude during 29 minutes to ground level without power;  \n\n5. Landing in the field. \n\nThe energy requirements have been calculate based on the efficiency of each component of \n\nthe propulsion system in every stage of the mission. The efficiencies of battery, cables and \n\nelectronic speed controlller ESC, are fixed for the entire mission while the efficiencies of the \n\nelectric motor and propeller are different in each stage.The propulsive power required for \n\neach stage of the mission can be estimated as:  \n\n \n\n???? = ?????? \u00d7 ??????  (3.1) \n\n \n \n\n                                                 \n(2) LAETA. Associated Laboratory for Energy, Transports and Aeronautics. Portugal \n\n(3) CCTAE.

Then the total required energy can be determined as: \n\n \n\n???? =\n????\n\n??????\n\u00d7 ??????  \n\n(3.4) \n\n \n\n \n\nThe best option to generate energy during cruise flight is to accommodate highly efficiency \n\nsolar cells on the upper wing surface. The total energy required and the maximum electrical \n\npower required were used for sizing the propulsion system.Table 3.1 summarizes the values \n\nof required electrical power and energy for each segment of the mission:  \n\n \nTable 3.1 \u2013 Energy requirements for propulsion system 20.  \n \n\n \n\n3.2 Aircraft Specifications \n\nThe aircraft dimension is important to produce a high performance design.It has to be large \n\nenough to accommodate all electronic but has to be capable of depoyment from small landing-\n\nfields.The conceptual design of the airframe has been concluded and some of the relevant \n\nUAV specfications are summarized in table 3.2 20. \n\nSegment ?stage ????/?stage (W)  ????

However, the use of conventional methods for energy storage do not allow \n\nthe storage of enough energy to sustain the model airborne over the course of the mission. \n\nFor this particullary reason, an electric propulsion system powered by photovoltaic solar cells \n\nwas planned.  This system would be accomplished by joining an energy storage device and an \n\nenergy production system. The energy accumulador would be a high density battery and the \n\nproduction system a solar array connected to a charge controller.  \n\nThe top, front and side view of the UAV are shown in Figure 3.2 as well CAD rendering of UAV \n\nat figure 3.3.  \n\n \n\n??? =\n100 ?  ???? ?  ???? \n\n100\n. ? \n\n  \n\n(3.6) \n\n??? =\n100 ?  ???\n\n100\n. ? \n\n(3.7) \n\nParameter Value Units \n\nTake-off Speed 5.19 m/s \n\nClimb Speed 6.67 m/s \n\nCruise Speed 7.5 m/s \n\nMaximum rate of climb 2.2 m/s \n\nMaximum Speed 21.1 m/s \n\nStall speed 6.1 m/s \n\nTake-off Roll distance 8.1 m \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.2 - CAD drawing views of UAV 21.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 3.3- CAD Rendering of UAV 21.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\n \n\nChapter 4 \n\n \n\nSolar Module, Solar Panel and Solar Array \n\nArrangement. \n\nIn the outdoor environment the magnitude of the current ouput from a PV module directly \n\ndepends on the solar irradiance and can be increased by connecting solar cells in parallel. \n\nThe voltage of a solar cell depends primarily on the cell temperature. PV modules can be \n\ndesigned to operate at different voltages by connecting solar cells in series. This chapter aims \n\nto describe and justify each decision regarding the solar module arrangement. \n\n4.1 Solar Panel  \n\nSunpower C60 solar cells have been chosen to supply the photovoltaic effect needed.Figure \n\n4.1 ilustrates these solar cells. \n\n \n \n\nFigure 4.1- C60 Solar Cell and Bond Pad Dimensions 22.  \n\n \n\nThe module is encapsulated with a polymer encapsulant on the front side and a polymer \n\nbacksheet, which protects and gives strength to the cells and allows easy mounting of the \n\npanel. The edges are sealed for weatherproofing. For large power applications, as in this case, \n\nthe PV modules are connected in series. \n\n  \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\n4.1.1 Efficiency  \n\nThe solar cell efficiency is defined as the ratio of energy output from the solar cell to \n\ninput energy from the sun. The energy conversion efficiency (???) of a solar cell is the \n\npercentage of the solar energy to which it is exposed that is converted into electrical \n\nenergy. This is calculated by dividing a cell\u2019s power ouput (in watts) at its maximum \n\npower point (????) by the input light irradiance (W/m2),  (????) and the surface area \n\nof the solar cell (?). Expressed as: \n\n??? =  \n????\n\n???? \u00d7 ?\n \n\n(4.1) \n\n4.1.2 Current and Voltage Solar Cell  \n\nThe typical I-V curve of a solar cell has a very characteristic shape. When the cell pads \n\nare not connected, no current is produced and the voltage equals to  ???, the open circuit \n\nvoltage. When it is short circuited, the voltage is zero but the current equals to ???. In \n\nbetween these two points there is a working point, called the maximum power point, \n\nwhere the power is the highest value possible and equals to: \n\n????=???? \u00d7  ????  \n\n \n\n(4.2) \n\n \n\nIt is exactly at this point that the cells should be operated and the ratio between  ???? \n\nand the light intensity represents precisely the efficiency of the solar cell. However, the \n\ncurve, and thus this point, is not fixed and varies depending on temperature and \n\nirradiance values. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2- Example of an I-V curve characteristcs of PV module 23. \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\n \n\nThe charge controller is used as an electronic device that varies the electrical operating \n\npoint of the solar array to extract the maximum power possible, called, MPPT.  As shown \n\nin Figure 4.3, the voltage and current typical efficiency curve depends on its irradiance \n\n(W/m2). \n\n \n\n \n  \n\nFigure 4.3-Sunpower C60 typical I-V Curve 22.   \n \n\nThe current of a solar cell is proportional to its area and varies almost linearly with the \n\nlight intensity.  Like all semiconductor devices, solar cells are sensitive to temperature. \n\nThe decrease in the band gap of a semiconductor with increasing the temperature can \n\nbe viewed as increasing the energy of the electrons in the material. Lower energy is \n\ntherefore needed to break the bond. In the bond model of a semiconductor band gap, \n\nreduction in the bond energy also reduces the band gap. Therefore increasing the \n\ntemperature reduces the band gap. In a solar cell, the parameter most affected by an \n\nincrease in temperature is the open-circuit voltage. The impact of increasing \n\ntemperature is shown in the figure 4.4 24. Chapter 7 shows a detailed study on the \n\ntemperature effect of the selected solar cells.  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.4- Effect of temperature on the I-V characteristics of a solar cell 24.  \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\n4.2 Solar Array  \n\nComponents of an electrical circuit can be connected in many diferent ways. The two simplest \n\nof these are called series and parallel. Components connected in series are connected along \n\na single path, so the same current flows through all components and the voltage increases. \n\nComponents connected in parallel are connected so the same voltage is applied to each \n\ncomponent, and the current increases.

The solar array consists of four modules of solar cells. Two modules of twelve \n\nphotovoltaic cells and two modules of ten photovoltaic cells, all connected in series, Table \n\n4.2: \n\n \n\nTable 4.2- Solar Panel characteristics.  \n \n\n \n\nParameter Mass (g) Dimensions (mm) Quantity (cells) \n\nIndividual cell 14 130 \u00d7 135 1 \n\n2 \u00d7 5 solar array 124.9 256 \u00d7 640 20 \n\n2\u00d76  Solar arry 147.3 256 \u00d7 766 24 \n\nTotal 544.4 - 44 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\n \n\nThe total area amounts to 0.72 m2, which at the rated efficiency should ouput 151.8 W at \n\nmaximum irradiation ground level of 1000 W/m2 at 25\u00ba C. Since a single solar cell produces a \n\nnominal voltage of 0.582 V, Table 4.1, and the propulsion system will work at 12 V, at least \n\n22 solar cells connected in series, ???  = 0.582 \u00d7 22 = 12.80 V, are required. Since the Rated \n\nbattery output current is 10.5 A and the recommended maximum ???  at STC is 27 V it was \n\ndecided that the four modules could be connected in series and therefore facilitate the \n\nwirring between the solar arrays.  We first start by multipling the 0.582 V by 44 solar cells to \n\nobtain the solar panel maximum nominal voltage:  \n\n????? ??? = 0.582 \u00d7 44 =  25.6  ? \n\n \n\n(4.3) \n\nSince the solar charger has a maximum output of 27 ? the connections are within the \n\nmaximum value. Following the same reasoning, the current of the solar panel connected in \n\nseries will be 5.93 A.Therefore, multipling the solar panel maximum voltage with the current \n\nwe obtain the maximum power ouput:  \n\n???? = 25.6 \u00d7 5.93 =  151.8 ? (4.4) \n\n \n\nThe battery module seleced in this system is a Lithium Polymer rechargeable battery with a \n\nnominal voltage of 11.1 V. As the maximum recommended voltage at STC of the charge \n\ncontroller is 27 V, the rated battery voltage is 12 V and the maximum power ouput from the \n\nsolar array is whithin the MPPT value and the system is compatible.

We write it as  ???(?) or as  \n?2?\n\n??2\n  and it studies the rate of change of \n\na continuous function. To deduce the second order equation a sixth degree polynomial \n\napproximation is used.The objective is to obtain an approximation as close as possible to the \n\nactual function. This is accomplished by using the polynomial of high degree, as shown in \n\nFigure 4.6.

Laminar flow tends to occur at lower velocities therefore \n\nthe airfoil disruption caused by the solar module should be placed as far back from the leading \n\neadge as possible. Figure 4.7 shows that the solar panels should be placed at 1.5 cm from the \n\ntrailing edge affect the aerodynamics of the airfoil as little as possible and to easily conform \n\nto its curvature.   \n\nTwo sets of twelve solar cells exact placement on the central module of the wing are shown \n\nin Figure 4.8 and 4.9. \n\n \n\nx/c\n\ny\n/\nc\n\ny\n/\nc\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.1\n\n0.12\n\n0.14\n\n12 % Airfoil\n\n2nd order differentiation\n\nRange estimation for smother curvature\n\n??\n6\n\n(?) =  ?34.8336? 5 + 93.215? 4 ? 94.64? 3 + 45.58? 2 ? 10.9594? + 1.1009 (4.6) \n\n  ??\n?\n6\n\n(?) = ?174.168? 4 + 372.86? 3 ? 283.92? 2 + 91.17? ? 10.9594 (4.7) \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n\n \nFigure 4.8- Solar panel placed on the central module of wing. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.9- Solar panel placed at 1.5 cm from the trailing edge. \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\n \n\nChapter 5 \n\n \n\nPropulsion System Components, Electric \n\nConfiguration and Installation on the Wing \n\nUnmanned aerial vechicles are ideally suited for long endurance flights, but to be able to \n\nmake full use of this feature, effective power sources need to be developed to ensure the \n\nlong endurance functionality of the propulsion system and onboard equipment. The objective \n\nof this section is to describe each different component of the solar powered system and \n\npresent the complete electric propulsion design. \n\n5.1 Propulsion System components \n\nA solar energy system that is properly installed and adequately sized will not require \n\nsignificant management. However, for those times of marginal sun or very large power \n\nrequirements it is important to understand the relationship between the battery charge level, \n\nthe amount of charge that they are receveing and the power being withdrawn from the \n\nsystem.Figure 5.1 shows the complete electric propulsion system scheme.  \n\n \n\nSolar Panel Battery\n\nESC\n\nGenasun GV-10\n\nMotor\n\n \n\nFigure 5.1- Electric Propulsion Configuration Scheme.  \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\n5.1.1 Solar Panel \n\nFor the solar array, Sunpower C60 Photovoltaic solar cells were chosen, figure 5.1. The anti-\n\nreflective coating and the reduced voltage provide exceptional energy delivery per power \n\nwatt. Their innovative all back contact design moves gridlines to the back of the cell, which \n\nnot only generates more power but also presents a more attractive cell design compared to \n\nconventional cells and a better surface for aerodynamic applications. \n\n  \n\n \n \n\nFigure 5.2- Sunpower C60 Photovoltaic Solar Cell 22. \n\nThe solar panel can be used as a component of a larger photovoltaic system to generate and \n\nsupply electricity in specific applications. Because a single solar cell can produce only a \n\nlimited amout of power, most installations contain multiple cells and e even panels. This \n\nproject\u2019s system layout contains 4 solar panels with a total of 44 cells wired in series generatin \n\n151.8 W with specific constraints.   \n\n5.1.2 Solar Charge Controller (SCC) \n\nA charge controller monitors the battery\u2019s state-of-charge to ensure that when the battery \n\nneeds charge-current it gets it, and also ensures the battery is not over-charged. Connecting \n\na solar panel to a battery without a regulator seriously risks damaging the battery and \n\npotentially causing a safety concern. Charge controllers are rated based on the amount of \n\ncurrent they can process from a solar array. If a controller is rated at 20 A it means that it is \n\npossible to connect up to 20 A of solar panel output current to this one controller. The most \n\nadvanced charge controllers also include maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techonology. \n\nThe charge controller chosen for LEEUAV Genasun GV-10, shown in figure 5.3. \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 5.3- MPPT Solar charge controller Genasun GV-10 25.  \n\n \n\nMaximum power point tracking is an electronic system that operates the PV modules in a \n\nmanner that allows the modules to produce all the power they are capable of. MPPT is a fully \n\nelectronic system that varies the electrical operating point of the modules maximizing the \n\namout of current going into the battery from the solar array by lowering the panel\u2019s output \n\nvoltage. \n\n5.1.3 Battery \n\nThe electrochemical batteries are energy storage devices which are able to convert \n\nchemically stored energy into electrical energy during discharging. They are composed of \n\ncathode and an anode made of two dissimilar metals that are in contact with an electrolyte. \n\nWhen all elements are in contact with each other, a flow of electrons is produced. The chosen \n\nbattery is LiPo (Lithium Polymer) and the main advantage of these batteries is its high \n\ndischarge capacity and good specific energy. The battery that fits in this propulsion system is \n\na 10,000 mAh 3S LiPo battery operating at a nominal voltage of 11.1 V. \n\n5.1.4 Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) \n\nAn electronic speed controller works by applying full voltage to the motor, but turning it on \n\nand off rapidly. By varying the ratio of on time to off time, the speed controller varies the \n\naverage voltage that the motor sees. Since at any given instant, the control is either fully off \n\nor fully on, this kind of control is theoretically 100 % efficient. In reality, electronic speed \n\ncontrollers are not 100 % efficient. Ignoring the factors introduced by switching rate the loss \n\nin efficiency is due to the fact the components doing the actual switching are not perfect. \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\nThey are not mechanical switches, and therefore have significant resistance. Whenever there \n\nis current flowing through a resistence, there is a power loss. When choosing the ESC it is \n\nnecessary taking into acount the carrying current capacity, which is at least 65 A already \n\nestablished on the prelimany design of the LEEUAV. The selected ESC is Castle Creations \n\nPhoenix Edge model lite 100 A, supporting a maximum current of 100 A.  \n\n5.1.5 Electric Motor and Propeller \n\nAn electric motor uses electrical energy to produce mechanical work. The selection of a \n\nparticular motor depends obviously on its application. Its choise has a major influence on the \n\naircraft performance. The most important factor to consider is the power required for all \n\nmission phases and the energy consumption during the mission as a whole. Finding a \n\ncombination of electric motor and propeller that matches a particular airplane and its desired \n\nperformance is complex if done in an exact manner. The chosen motor is Hyperion ZS 3025-\n\n10 with a 13\u201dx8\u201d propeller. \n\n5.2 Electric Configuration \n\n \n\n5.2.1 Solar Panel- Charge Controller (Genasun GV-10) \n\nSince the brigther the sunlight, the more voltage the solar cells produce, the excessive \n\nvoltage could damage the batteries. A charge controller is used to maintain the proper \n\ncharging voltage on the batteries. An American wire gauge conductor (AGW) is used to \n\nconnect the components of the solar energy system, ensuring low loss of energy and \n\npreventing overheating. The AWG is a standardized wire gauge system for the diameters of \n\nround, solid, nonferrous, electrically conducting wire. The larger the AWG number or wire \n\ngauge, the smaller the physical size of the wire. The smallest AWG size is 40 and the largest \n\nis 0000. Since the maximum current ouput from the solar panel is 6A the AGW 20 was first \n\nchosen but due to its overheating and power losses a second choice led to AGW 12 with a \n\nlength of 40 cm. \n\n \n\nIt can be observed in Figure 5.4 that the solar panels are connected to the input terminals \n\nof the charge controller, positive solar panel with positive charge controller and negative \n\nsolar panel with negative charge controller.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 5.4- Solar Panel connect to the Charge controller 25. \n\n \n5.2.2 Charge Controller-Battery \n\nAfter connecting the solar panels to the input terminals of the charge controller, the same \n\nsize wire can be used to connect the charge controller output to the batteries since these \n\nwires will carry no more current than the solar panel wires. The charge controller self \n\nprotection feature will prevent damage from reverse polarity connections, but the charge \n\ncontroller will not function until the battery is connected properly (positive battery wire with \n\npositive charger controller and negative battery wire with negative charge controller). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 5.5- Charge controller connect with battery 25.   \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\n5.2.3 Battery-Motor \n\nOnce the battery is properly connected to the charge controller ouput terminals we must \n\nattach a battery connector, connect the motor to the ESC and, finally, the ESC to the \n\nreceiver, performing the following steps:  \n\n1. Battery connector  \n\n \n\nA battery connector will be attached (XT60 connectors) to the red \n\n(+) and black (-) power wires and then the battery connectorwill be \n\nsoldered to the wires ensuring that the polarity is correct (red wire \n\nto battery red wire, black wire to battery black wire).  \n\n \n\n2. Connecting  Motor to ESC \n\n \n\nRegarding the Motor-ESC connection it is necessary to solder the \n\ncorresponding connectors (bullet connectors) for the motor to the \n\nwires coming from the ESC. It is important to ensure that the soldered \n\njoint is solid since poor soldering is a commom cause of failure. \n\n \n\n3. Connecting ESC to Receiver  \n\n \n\nThe receiver lead (the brown/red/orange wires with a black plastic connector on the \n\nend) is connected to the throttle channel on the receiver. \n\n \n\n5.3 Installation of the Solar Arrays on the Wing   \n\nWith the solar cells being a critical part of the aircraft, their position has to be correctly \n\nplanned to preserve the UAV balance, both on the ground and during flight. Since its fuselage \n\nis very thin and the four panel modules cover an area of around 0.72 m 2 the need to place \n\nthe solar cells on the UAV wing is clear. Since the aircraft has to be small enough to deplete \n\nfrom small landing fields and be easily transported, the wing was divided in three parts, as \n\nseen in Figure 5.7.  \n\nFigure 5.6- Battery- Motor connection 26. \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.7- Solar modules integration view on the wing. \n\n \n\nModule (a) and (c) are covered with a solar array of ten solar cells each one, and module (b) \n\nwith two sets of twelve solar cells connected in series. The system consists of 44 solar cells \n\nwith 544.4 g of mass wired in series (JST connecters from (a) to (b) and from (b) to (c)). On \n\nmodule (b), the wiring between the two sets is completed using a bullet and a XT30 connecter \n\nto enable the connection whithin the solar array, the charge controller and the battery as can \n\nbe seen in Figure 5.9.   \n\n \n\nFigure 5.8- Module (a) and (b) wired with a JST connecter. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.9- Module (b) wired with a bullet and a XT30 connecter.  \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nIn these conditions, the solar UAV can accomplish a sustained flight of full eight hours during \n\nthe summer months, being the battery recharged during flight. During the night time the \n\nsystem will be only powered by the battery. The system energy generation is compound by \n\nthe solar module which is connected to the charge controller referred in section 5.2.1. The \n\npropulsion system consists of the Hyperion ZS 3025-10 electric motor powering a \n\n13\u201dx8\u201d propeller and controlled by a Castle Creations Phoenix Edge ESC.   \n\n Regarding the attachement on the wing, placing the solar cells flushed with the wing\u2019s upper \n\nsurface enclosed by an anti-reflective coating on top offers multiple advantages, although, in \n\nthe first instance it was decided to place them on the top of the wing upper surface for \n\nsimplicity.The solar panels are directly attached with adhesive tape onto the shrink film that \n\ncovers the whole wing, with a reinforcement on the ribs and trailing edge area.The four solar \n\nmodules arrangement are shown in Figure 5.11.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.11- Solar Panel arrangement on the wing.  \n\nFigure 5.10- Module (b) and (c) wired with a JST connecter.  \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\n \n\nChapter 6 \n\n \n\nSolar Arrays Experiments  \n\nThis chapter aims to report the solar cells experiments that were carried out to measure the \n\nefficiency and compare with that given by the manufacturer of the selected photovoltaic solar \n\ncells. To validate the system the typical I-V curve was first built and then the efficiency was \n\ncalculated using a variable load and a pyranomter.These steps are described in the following \n\nsections.  \n\n6.1. Pyranometer  \n\nA pyranometer is a device for measuring solar radiation on a normally flat surface. \n\nMeasurement of solar radiation per unit surface area (W/m2) is termed irradiance. Irradiance \n\nmeasurement requires, by definition, that the pyranometer\u2019s sensor response to radiation \n\nvaries with the cosine of the angle of incidence from a line vertical to the surface of the \n\nsensor. The pyranometer used is the SP-215 Apogee, which means we can amplify the signal \n\nwith a power source of no more than 24 VDC. According to the SP 215 Apogee manual 27 \u201c \n\nApogee Instruments SP series pyranometres consist of a cast acrylic  diffuser, photodiode, and \n\nsignal processing circuitry mounted in an anodized aluminum housing, and a cable to connect \n\nthe  sensor to a measurement device. Sensors are potted solid with no internal air space and \n\nare designed for continuous total shortwave radiation measurement on a planar surface in \n\noutdoor environments. SP series sensors ouput an analog voltage that is directly proportional \n\nto toal shortwave radiation from the sun. The voltage signal from the sensor is directly \n\nproportional to radiation incident on a planar surface (does not have to be horizontal), where \n\nthe radiation emanates from all angles of a hemisphere.\u201d  \n\n6.1.1 Operation and Measurement \n\nIt is necessary to connect the sensor to a measurement device capable of measuring and \n\ndisplaying a voltage signal. In order to maximize measurement resolution and signal to \n\nnoise ratio, the input range of the measurement device should closely match the ouput \n\nrange of the pyranometer. It is also required to power the sensor with a DC voltage by \n\nconnecting the positive signal to the white wire from the sensor and the negative or \n\ncommon to the clear wire from the sensor and to use a voltemer to measure across the \n\ngreen wire ouput signal and the clear wire.  All apogee pyranometer models have a \n\nstandart calibration curve 27.In this case the equation of calibration is: \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 6.2 Solar Power Measurements \n\nThe solar experiments were conducted with a solar array of ten solar cells wired in series \n\nattached to the central module of the wing. In order to understand the behavior of the solar \n\npanel, a variable load is used. To simulate the electrical consumption of the motor, the choice \n\nled to three rheostats (connected in series) wired to a power meter and the solar array. Also, \n\nto help calculate the efficiency of the solar array, a pyranometer was used as mentioned \n\npreviously. These experiments took place in Covih\u00e3 during the summer months. \n\n6.2.1 Solar irradiance measurement  \n\nSince the pyranometer used to measure the irradiation from the sun was internally \n\namplified, a power source of no more than 24 VDC was required. At first, the power \n\nsupply was a voltage source of 5 V connected to a bench multimeter but, in order to \n\nminimize the power losses, the power source went from a voltage source to a 2S LiPo \n\nbattery connected to a multimeter with JST connectors, as shown in Figure 6.1.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6.1- SP-215 Apogee pyranometer connected to a multimeter and a battery. \n  \n\n??????????? ?????? \u00d7  ?????? ????? = ????????? ?????????       \n \n\n                     0.25 ?/?2 ??? ?? \u00d7  ?? = ?/?2 \n \n\n    \n\n(6.1)   \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\n \n\n6.2.2 Typical I-V Efficiency Curve \n\nThe I-V (Current-Voltage) curve of a PV module describes its energy conversion capability \n\nat the existing conditions of irradiance and temperature. Conceptually, the curve \n\nrepresents the combination of current and voltage at which the PV module could be \n\noperated, if the irradiance and cell temperature could be held constant. Figure 6.2 shows \n\ndifferent efficiency curves. The span of the I-Vcurve ranges from the short circuit current \n\nat zero volts, to zero current at the open circuit voltage. At both points the power \n\ngenerated is zero. ???  occurs when the ouput current of the cell is zero, I=0 and the \n\nshunt resistance ??? is neglected. The short circuit,??? ,is the current at V=0 and is \n\napproximately equal to the light generated current. At the \u2018knee\u2019 of a normal I-V curve \n\nis the maximum electrical power point (???? ,????  ), the point at which the array \n\ngenerates maximum electrical power.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.2- Efficiency I-V Curve at different Irradiance values. \n\nIn order to build the typical I-V efficiency curve three variable loads were used to \n\nsimulate the motor electrical consumption and find the ??? , maximum power point and \n\n???  values. When comparing these results with the typical I-V curve of Sunpower C60 \n\ndatasheet the similarity is clear. Because the testing conditions are not as ideal as in the \n\nlaboratory, average temperature of 36\u00baC at ground level and non-controlled irradiance \n\nvalues, the obtained results are not as bright as shown in the datasheet.

The other reason for \n\nthe difference between the curves is the fact that the manufacturer\u2019s curves were \n\nobtained at a controlled environment with STC conditions and these tests were \n\nconducted with the cell being heated by the sun making the solar array less efficient \n\n(detailed study in section 6.4).  \n\n6.2.3 MPPT working method \n\nAs previously explained, MPPT alghoritms are necessary in PV applications because the \n\nmaximum power point of a solar panel varies with irradiance and temperature, so the \n\nuse of a charge controller with MPPT techonology is required in order to obtain the \n\nmaximum power from the solar array.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6.3- Power Output Evolution. \n\nAssuming the solar panel conditions are 25\u00baC at ground level 1000 W/m2 the entire solar \n\nsystem has a ????  of 25.6 V and an ???? of 5.93 A , ???? = 151.81 ?.

Solar array electrical parameters \n\nwere recorded with and without the solar film covering the panel. The experimental test \n\nresults are presented in Table 6.1.   \n\nTable 6.1- Results of the film covering experiments. \n \n\n \n\nAs it was expected, the solar cell covered with the film had their efficiency reduced but just \n\nslightly. There is an ouput loss ofaround 1% when covering the solar cells with the transparent \n\n                                                 \n(6) Boost- Amplify an electrical signal. \n\nAzimuth 0\u00ba  Irradiance (W/m2) Voltage (V) Current (A) Power (A) Efficiency (%) \n\nClean 882.5 4.39 5.12 22.5 15.9 \n\nTransparent Film 882.5 4.53 4.5 20.4 14.4 \n\nAzimuth 90\u00ba  Irradiance (W/m2) Voltage (V) Current (A) Power (A) Efficiency (%) \n\nClean 907.5 4.52 5.04 22.8 15.7 \n\nTransparent Film 847.5 4.39 4.66 20.5 15.1 \n\nAzimuth 180\u00ba  Irradiance (W/m2) Voltage (V) Current (A) Power (A) Efficiency (%) \n\nClean 862.5 4.52 4.66 21.1 15.3 \n\nTransparent Film 862.5 4.87 4.00 19.48 14.1 \n\nAzimuth 270\u00ba  Irradiance (W/m2) Voltage (V) Current (A) Power (A) Efficiency (%) \n\nClean 820 4.33 4.15 18.0 13.7 \n\nTransparent Film 822.5 4.47 3.73 16.7 12.7 \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\nfilm. As it is clear from Table 6.1, this efficiency loss would not affect significantly the aircraft \n\nperformance, although, these experiments were conducted for a very short period of time \n\nand the effect over a long-term could be worst when the solar module heats up.  \n\n6.4 Effect of Temperature on Efficiency \n\nTemperature also affects the characteristics of solar cells. When it increases, the voltage \n\ndecreases whereas the current increases insignificantly. Globally, the power that a solar cell \n\ncan give is higher for lower panel temperatures, considering the same irradiance conditions. \n\n \n\nFigure 6.4- Variation of the current to voltage curve of a solar array with Irradiance and Temperature. \n\nThe experiments were conducted on a non-controlled environment, where Datasheet STC \n\nconditions could not be replicated. The first setback was the irradiance from the Sun. Since \n\nsolar conditions change throughout the day, the irradiance at the beginning of the test is \n\ndifferent from the irradiance at the end. Therefore, several experiments were conducted and \n\nvarious I-V curves were extracted (Figure 6.4.). Two samples of an I-V curve at different \n\ntemperatures are shown in Figure 6.5. \n\n \n\nVoltage, V\n\nC\nu\nrr\ne\nn\nt,\nA\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n900 W/m^2, 72\u00baC\n\n885 W/m^2, 62\u00baC\n\n847.5 W/m^2, 68 \u00baC\n\n805 W/m^2, 43\u00baC\n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6.5- Two I-V curves at different temperatures. \n\nTo gather data for this chart, a PV panel was placed on the central module of the wing. The \n\nfirst measurements were taken in ambient temperature conditions, and then they were taken \n\nagain after the panel was cooled with a fan. It can be concluded that the efficiency slightly \n\ndecreases from its reference amount while temperature of the cell increases. The array will \n\nbe heated up to 75\u00baC in a day average temperature of 36\u00baC when the cell is exposed directly \n\nto the sun, which results in loss of efficiency. However, the air flowing over the wing without \n\na cover film decreases the temperature about 20\u00baC in less than 10 minutes at the speed of \n\n2.8 m/s.Therefore, when the panel is at a higher temperature, a lower open circuit voltage \n\nis produced and the short circuit current increases insignificantly. The I-V curve with an \n\nirradiance value of 900 W/m2 has a maximum power ouput of 21.5 W and the I-V curve of \n\n800 W/m2 an ouput of 22 W. \n\n6.5 Solar angles-of-incidence  \n\n6.5.1 The Axes of Flight \n\nEach axis of flight is an imaginary line around which an airplane can turn. Regardless of \n\nthe type of aicraft, there are three axes upon which it can move: Left and Right, Forwards \n\nand Backwards, Up and Down. In aviation their technical names are lateral axis, \n\nlongitudinal axis and vertical axis. \n\n \n\nVoltage, V\n\nC\nu\nrr\ne\nn\nt,\nA\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6 900 W/m^2, 72\u00baC\n\n805 W/m^2, 43\u00baC\n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6.6- Aicraft Axes Flight illustration 28.   \n\nAccording to NASA \u201cThe yaw axis is defined to be perpendicular to the plane of the wings \n\nwith its origin at the center of gravity and directed towards the bottom of the aircraft. \n\nA yaw motion is a movement of the nose of the aircraft from side to side. The pitch axis \n\nis perpendicular to the yaw axis and is parallel to the plane of the wings with its origin \n\nat the center of gravity and directed towards the right wing tip. A pitch motion is an up \n\nor down movement of the nose of the aircraft. The roll axis is perpendicular to the other \n\ntwo axes with its origin at the center of gravity, and is directed towards the nose of the \n\naircraft. A rolling motion is an up and down movement of the wing tips of the aircraft.\u201d  \n\n6.5.2 Azimuth Angle  \n\nAn azimuth is an angular measurement in a spherical coordinate system. The vector from \n\nan observer to a point of interest is projected perperdiculary onto a reference plane; the \n\nangle between the projected vector and a reference vector on the reference plane is \n\ncalled the azimuth.Azimuth is ussaly measured in degrees.  Quite commonly, azimuths \n\nare stated in a system in which either north our south can be zero and the angle may be \n\nmeasured clockwise or anticlockwise from the zero. In our case the reference plane is \n\nthe North. \n\n6.5.3 Solar experiments \n\n\n\n \n\n45 \n\n \n\nThe change in the Azimuth angle during the day affects the power ouput of the PV \n\nmodule. One way to determine this would be to take measurements throught the day as \n\nthe sun changed its angle relative to the panel module, but another way and easier to do \n\nis to roughly simulate the same effect by rotating the module in relation to the sun \n\nsetting an initial position, in this case, north. While taking measurements it is important \n\nthat irradiation readings be as constant as possible.To conduct these measurements the \n\naircraft nose was placed towards North moving clockwise on a 360 degree circle, firstly \n\nhorizontal and then combined with different pitch and roll angles. The experiment profile \n\ncan be summarized as:  \n\n1. Location: Covilh\u00e3; \n\n2. Aircraft initial position: Nose facing North, 0\u00ba Azimuth; \n\n3. Irradiance values: Irradiance received at a ten solar cell module attached to a \n\nwing prototype central module; \n\n4. Date: Mid-August, 2015; \n\n5. Experiment duration: 14:30-16:00 \n\n6. Ambient temperature: 36\u00baC \n\n \n\nThe solar measurements started at 14:30 with an average temperature of 36 \u00baC. In these \n\nconditions the aircraft nose was placed facing north. At this time, the aircraft was facing \n\nthe sun for this reason 0\u00ba azimuth has the highest power ouput value. All irradiance values \n\ntaken during this experiment refer to irradiance receveid at the solar module (see Table \n\n6.2). \n\n \n\nTable 6.2 \u2013 Simulated Azimuth Angles. \n \n\nSimulated Azimuth \nAngles \n\nIrradiance \n(W/m2) \n\nVoltage (V) Amperage (A) Power Output (W) \n\n0\u00ba 1200 4.59 5.51 25.3 \n\n45\u00ba 992.5 4.21 5.48 23.0 \n\n90\u00ba 925 4.25 5.16 21.9 \n\n135\u00ba 825 4.53 4.59 20.8 \n\n180\u00ba 855 4.76 4.84 23.0 \n\n225\u00ba 795 4.37 4.48 19.6 \n\n270\u00ba 772.5 4.97 3.82 19.0 \n\n315\u00ba 877.5 4.47 4.78 21.4 \n\n \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\nThe experiment was conducted as quickly as possible, however the test still lasted 1 hour \n\nand 30 minutes, which means that the irradiance values were not as controlled as \n\nexpected. Still, the values are consistent and it is possible to conclude that giving the \n\nairfoil curvature and position of the panels on the wing, according to Table 6.2, the north \n\n(0\u00ba azimuth) and south (180\u00ba azimuth) position are the most advantageous when it comes \n\nto enhace solar irradiance absorption, rising the available power ouput, Figure 6.7.These \n\nfirst measurements values refer to different angles of azimuth in relation to the sun with \n\nno influence of pitch and roll angles.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6.7- Influence of different azimuth angles on irradiance and power ouput. \n\nAs already refered, the first measurements were taken with the wing horizontal, not only \n\nto understand the azimuth effect on the power ouput but also to supply a base line when \n\ncomparing these results to the influence of pitch and roll angles. The azimuth, pitch and \n\nroll angles are defined in the following graphis as A, P and R respectivelly. \n\nAccording to the chart shown in Figure 6.8, an average of 2 % power loss was observed \n\nwhen the wing was moved on a pitch angle between 10\u00ba to 20\u00ba. However the roll angle \n\nhad an insignificant influence in 0\u00ba azimuth. On the other hand, when comparing the \n\nresults obtained in for 45\u00ba azimuth, Figure 6.8,  there is an average of 3% power gain o \n\nwhen moving the wing on a pitch  of 10\u00ba to 20\u00ba and a decline of 1 % in roll.  This power \n\nouput gain was expected since the irradiance from the sun arrives at a more \n\nperpendicular angle, reducing the losses from reflection. Regarding the 90\u00ba azimuth case, \n\nthere is no major impact from a variation of pitch and roll. The most affected positions \n\nto a variation of picth and roll were 135\u00ba, 225\u00ba and 270\u00ba azimuth (Figures 6.9, 6.10, 6.11). \n\nAzimuth Angle, degree (\u00ba)\n\nIr\nra\nd\nia\nn\nc\ne\n,\nW\n/\nm\n^\n2\n\nP\no\nw\ne\nr,\n\nW\n\n0 45 90 135 180 225 270 315 360\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nIrradiance\n\nPower Output\n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n\n \n\nAs the wing module suffers a variation of pitch from 10\u00ba to 20\u00ba the power ouput decreases \n\n40%, however the roll angle variation approaches the availabe power ouput from its \n\nazimuth\u2019s original value.  \n\n \n\nFigure 6.8- 0\u00ba and 45\u00ba azimuth with different combinations of pitch and roll. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.9- 90\u00ba and 135\u00ba azimuth with different combinations of pitch and roll. \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\nVoltage, V\n\nP\no\nw\ne\nr,\n\nW\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nA= 0\u00ba\n\nP=10\u00ba\n\nP= 20\u00ba\n\nR=10\u00ba\n\nR= 20\u00ba\n\nVoltage, V\nP\no\nw\ne\nr,\n\nW\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nA= 45\u00ba\n\nP=10\u00ba\n\nP= 20\u00ba\n\nR=10\u00ba\n\nR= 20\u00ba\n\nVoltage, V\n\nP\no\nw\ne\nr,\n\nW\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nA= 90\u00ba\n\nP=10\u00ba\n\nP= 20\u00ba\n\nR=10\u00ba\n\nR= 20\u00ba\n\nVoltage, V\n\nP\no\nw\ne\nr,\n\nW\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nA= 135\u00ba\n\nP=10\u00ba\n\nP= 20\u00ba\n\nR=10\u00ba\n\nR= 20\u00ba\n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6.10- 180\u00ba and 225\u00ba azimuth with different combinations of pitch and roll. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6.11- 270\u00ba and 315\u00ba azimuth with different combinations of pitch and roll. \n \n\n \n \n\nVoltage, V\n\nP\no\nw\ne\nr,\n\nW\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nA= 180\u00ba\n\nP=10\u00ba\n\nP= 20\u00ba\n\nR=10\u00ba\n\nR= 20\u00ba\n\nVoltage, V\n\nP\no\nw\ne\nr,\n\nW\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nA= 225\u00ba\n\nP=10\u00ba\n\nP= 20\u00ba\n\nR=10\u00ba\n\nR= 20\u00ba\n\nVoltage, V\n\nP\no\nw\ne\nr,\n\nW\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nA= 270\u00ba\n\nP=10\u00ba\n\nP= 20\u00ba\n\nR=10\u00ba\n\nR= 20\u00ba\n\nVoltage, V\n\nP\no\nw\ne\nr,\n\nW\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nA= 315\u00ba\n\nP=10\u00ba\n\nP= 20\u00ba\n\nR=10\u00ba\n\nR= 20\u00ba\n\n\n\n \n\n49 \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6.12- Pitch angle effect on power ouput. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6.13-Roll angle effect on power ouput.  \n\nPitch, degree (\u00ba)\n\nP\no\nw\ne\nr,\n\nW\n\n0 10 20\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nA=0\u00ba\n\nA=45\u00ba\n\nA=90\u00ba\n\nA=135\u00ba\n\nA=180\u00ba\n\nA=225\u00ba\n\nA=270\u00ba\n\nA=315\n\nRoll, degree (\u00ba)\n\nP\no\nw\ne\nr,\nW\n\n0 10 20\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nA=0\u00ba\n\nA=45\u00ba\n\nA=90\u00ba\n\nA=135\u00ba\n\nA=180\u00ba\n\nA=225\u00ba\n\nA=270\u00ba\n\nA=315\u00ba\n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\nThe power incident on a PV module depends not only on the power contained in the \n\nsunlight, but also on the angle between the module and the Sun. Experiments show that \n\nthe phovoltaic system exact azimuth orientation is not critical. Vertical axis and lateral \n\naxis, given by pitch and roll, have a more important effect on performance. When the \n\nabsorbing surface and the sunlight are perpendicular to each oher, the power density on \n\nthe surface is equal to that of sunlight. Concluding, between 0\u00ba and 180\u00ba Azimuth, 91 % \n\nof the maximum energy is available moving north-east at several pitch and roll angles. \n\nMoving towards south-west systems are silghtly less efficient but whithin accepted level. \n\nData collected shows that there is a 15 % power loss when moving towards west increasing \n\nthe diffuse radiation and lowering the available power. Since this propulsion system is \n\nnot a fixed solar panel on a roof or on an airframe fixed at a given place, any efficiency \n\nloss in the power output can easily be minimized by encouraging flying the aircraft in a \n\npattern favouring a better attitude towards the Sun. Of course small variations in these \n\nvalues are not all problematic. \n\n \n\n6.5.4 Loiter Pattern Simulation  \n\nBy simulating a loiter pattern, an average power ouput during a possible aircraft \n\nsurveillance mission can be determined. This simulation was done using the data from \n\nthe graphis in section 6.5.3 and considering certain time intervals at each selected \n\nattitude. The profile simulation was defined as a land observation flight 1000 m long with \n\nan average cruise speed of 7.5 m/s and an altitude of 1000 m.Considering an eight hour \n\nloiter with several full laps an taking into account the variation of the solar irradiance \n\ndue to sun position, a full lap duration is reached by: \n\n \n\n? = ? \u00d7 ? (6.1) \n\n \n\nwhere ? is the corresponding flight 1000 m long and ? is the average cruise speed having \n\n? as 133.3 seconds. Therefore, if one lap corresponds to 133.3 seconds then 28,800 \n\nseconds (8 hour loiter) correspond to 216 laps. Considering that the perimeter of a \n\ncircular turn is given by:  \n\n \n \n\n? =\n2 \u00d7 ? \u00d7 ?2\n\n? \u00d7 tan (?)\n \n\n \n\n(6.2) \n\n \n \n \n\nThen a half turn with ? as 7.5 m/s and  ?  as 10\u00ba gives  ?=102.2 m and ?=13.64 s.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n51 \n\n \n\nAs it can be seen from Figure 6.14, two basic types of mission segments are modeled: \n\ntwo steady-level cruise legs with 53 seconds each one and two turns with 13.64 \n\nseconds. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6.14- Loiter pattern simulation. \n\nAs already mentioned this simulation was done using the data from the graph shown \n\nin section 6.5.3 and assuming that radition emission from the sun remains constant \n\nfor an hour, therefore, 8 different irradiance conditions were emulated. Notice that \n\nat the cruise speed of 7.5 m/s and 1000 m flight long, one hour corresponds to 27 laps \n\nand each turn has its characteristic average irradiance. Also, these experiements were \n\nconducted with a ten solar cell module, so, in order to obtain a power ouput from the \n\ncomplete solar array, it is necessary to convert the obtained available power value of \n\na single solar cell and multiply it by 44 (44 solar cells wired in series). \n\nThe average irradiance at 10:30 in Covilh\u00e3 is around 800 W/m2 which gives an available \n\npower of 90 W. Until mid-day the irradiance values rises up to 1200 w/m2 remaining  \n\nalmost constant during 2 hours, delivering 109 W. The lowest irradiance corresponds \n\nto 600 W/m2, 60 W. So, taking into account that the MPPT\u2019s efficiency is 98% as given \n\nby the manufacter22, the delivered average power output would be 93 W. Notice that \n\nthe aircraft starts the loiter pattern facing north accomplished its first turn at second \n\n65 towards east and the second turn at second 130.3 towards west. These values \n\npresented at figure 6.14 are an average power ouput.  \n\n  \n\nTime, seconds\n\nP\no\nw\ne\nr,\nW\n\n0 30 60 90 120 150\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\n120\n10h30m\n\n11h30m\n\n12h30m\n\n13h30m\n\n14h30m\n\n15h30m\n\n16h30m\n\n17h30m\n\n\n\n52 \n\n \n\nChapter 7 \n\n \n\nMission Simulation \n\nIn order to validate the solar propulsion system a misson simulation was performed. The \n\ncomplete propulsion and data acquisition system were transported to the University of Beira \n\nInterior\u2019s wind tunnel where the take-off and cruise stage conditions could be replicated. \n\nFigure 7.1 ilustrates the wind tunnel used during the simulation.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 7.1 \u2013 University Beira Interior\u2019s wind tunnel used during mission simulation.  \n\nFirstly the Hyperion ZS 3020-10 motor and 13\u201dx8\u201d propeller were attached to a vertical \n\nbalance arm inside the wind tunnel, Figure 7.2. Once the motor and propeller were properly \n\nattached, the ESC was connected to the battery and the battery to the charge controller \n\nchosen, Genasun GV-10. Between the battery and charge controller a power log was placed \n\nto read the ouput power from the solar panel. The misson conditions were controlled inside \n\na control room, where the thrust setting was adjusted according to each stage of the misson \n\nas well as the aircraft speed. \n\nAs already mentioned, a power log was placed between Genasun GV-10 and the 10,000 mAh \n\nLiPo battery to read the power output from the solar panel, as it is shown in Figure 7.3.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n53 \n\n \n\n   \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\nFinally, the solar panels were mounted on a wing prototype outside the wind tunnel, Figure \n\n7.4. The simulation took place in Covilh\u00e3 during the summer months, namely, end of August \n\nfrom 14:30 to 18:00 with the wing facing east. Once the complete propulsion and data \n\nacquisition system were placed on the appropriate place, the mission simulation started.The \n\nmotor was run at full throttle for approximately 10 minutes with an average speed of 6.5 m/s \n\nand then reduced to nearly 50 W at a flight cruise speed of 7.5 m/s. It is important to \n\nunderstand that the sustainable-flight of full eight hours was not possible to replicate because \n\nsunlight only shows between 13:00 to 18:00 at the wind tunnel site given a total of 5 hours of \n\nsolar irradiance. \n\n \n\n \n\n Figure 7.4-Solar module attached to wing prototype for mission simulation. \n\nFigure 7.3- Power log placed between Battery   \n\nand Charge Controller.   \nFigure 7.2- Mission simulation using wind tunnel. \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\nDuring the climb phase observed in Figure 7.5 the electric power required is 411 W, below \n\nthe expected. This is due to the mounting of the motor being inside of a wind tunnel and the \n\nconditions being considered ideal. The test began at 14:30 with a received solar irradiance of \n\n880 W/m2 which resulted in 90 W of solar panel power. It can be observed in Figure 7.5 that \n\nthe power required during the climb phase is higher than the available power from the solar \n\nmodule. Therefore, the remaining required power will come from the battery, thus \n\ndischarging it. On the other hand, during the cruise phase the power supplied by the solar \n\narray is higher than the power required by the motor, thus the excess power will charge the \n\nbattery. These experiments were conducted in a place surrounded by mountains, therefore, \n\nthe sun starts to disappear earlier and sunlight decreases abruptly, for this reason at minute \n\n117 there is a significant drop in the power ouput from the solar module.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 7.5 \u2013 Electric power required and supplied during mission simulation. \n\nUsing the Power curves in Figure 7.5 and the trapezoidal rule, the energy consumed during \n\nthe climb phase, between minute 2 and 12, was calculated to be 189 kJ. It can be seen from \n\nFigure 7.6 that the consumed energy during climb corresponds to the energy peak existing in \n\nthe graph being the total required energy and supplied energy 1174.10 kJ and 1249 kJ, \n\nrespectively.  \n\nThe batteries have a capacity of 10,000 mAh (432 kJ). During the climb phase the propulsion \n\nsub-system consumed 63 % of the available energy (6275.6 mAh, 259 kJ), without the solar \n\ninput the remaining energy, at an average cruise power of 50W, would last for around 30 \n\nminutes.  \n\nTime, minutes\n\nP\no\nw\ne\nr,\nW\n\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\nPower Required\n\nPower Supplied\n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7.6- Consumed energy and supplied energy during mission simulation. \n\nAlthough the simulation only lasted for 5 hours this does not mean that the sustainable flight \n\nof full eight hours plus climb is not possible.

Until mid day \n\nthe irradiance value rises up to 1025 W/m2 meaning a power ouput of 111 W. If the climb \n\nphase consumes around 6,500 mAh, previously seen from the mission simulation, and with an \n\naverage charge current of 2 A (solar array delivering 6 A and motor consuming 4 A) the battery \n\nwill be fully charged in approximately 2 hours. Assuming ambient conditions are ideal, the \n\nmotor will use direct energy from the solar module during 5 hours. Averaging 1 hour and a \n\nhalf power coming from the battery the mission could last for around 8 hours and a half.   \n\n\n\n \n\n57 \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n58 \n\n \n\nChapter 8 \n\n \n\n8.1 Conclusion \n\nThe purpose of this master thesis was to design a solar propulsion system for a long endurance \n\nelectric UAV enabling a sustainable-flight of 8 hours during the Spring or Autumn equinox. \n\nThrough this dissertation the mission was described along with detailed information about the \n\nenergy requirements. Since this propulsion system is aimed at the use of green power \n\ntechnologies, the best option was focused on the use of high efficiency solar cells attached \n\non the upper wing surface. The electric propulsion system is compound by the energy \n\ngeneration and storage systems, the solar module connected to the charge controller and a \n\nLiPo battery, respectivelly. The propulsion system consists on the Hyperion ZS 3025-10 electric \n\nmotor driving a 13\u201dx8\u201dpropeller and controlled by Castle Creations Phoenix Edge ESC. To \n\nverify the validity of this system, several tests were carried out.  \n\nTo understand the power output from the solar module, the first step was to verify the \n\nefficiency I-V curves given by the Sunpower C60 manufacturer. To accomplish that, three \n\nvariable loads and a pyranometer were used to measure the irradiance. Once the experiments \n\nwere conducted and reviewed, it could be seen that the results obtained were very similar to \n\nthe supplied manufacturer information. The only differences between these results were the \n\nnon controlled environment of these performed experiments. The next step was to test the \n\nsolar module efficiency loss due to solar cell temperature. As it was expect the solar power \n\nouput is higher when solar cells are in a colder environment. Air flow through the wing during \n\nflight would decrease solar cell temperature resulting in a power ouput gain.  \n\nThe power incident on a PV module depends not only on the power contained in the sunlight, \n\nbut also on the angle between the module and the Sun, for this reason, some experiments to \n\nunderstand the contribution of azimuth, pitch and roll on power output were conducted. \n\nExperiments show that the phovoltaic system exact azimuth orientation is not critical. \n\nVertical axis and lateral axis, given by pitch and roll, have a more important effect on \n\nperformance.  \n\nOnce the solar module behavior was understood throught different temperatures and \n\nirradiance values, a mission simulation was performed where the complete propulsion system \n\nand acquistion data system were installed in a wind tunnel. There were limitations at first \n\nsince sunlight only strikes for 5 hours on the wind tunnel. However, the solar UAV \n\naccomplished his purpose with success, exhibiting sustainable flight of 5 hours. Despite the \n\nsimulation only lasted for 5 hours this does not mean the full eigh hour sustainable flight can \n\nnot be accomplished. When the power required by the motor is higher than the power supplied \n\nby the PV module the lacking power will come from the battery, thus discharging it. On the \n\n\n\n \n\n59 \n\n \n\nother hand, during cruise the power supplied by the solar array is higher than the power \n\nrequired by the motor and the excess will charge the battery. \n\nAlthough some limitations were found, this master thesis objectives were successfully \n\nachieved. \n\nConcluding, important parameters which influence the ouput power and efficiency of PV cells \n\nshould be taken into consideration for achievieng the desired performance in a solar-powered \n\naircraft. Also, the type of covering and mounting of the cells affects the direct incident solar \n\nradiation, the amount of heat transfer on the wings and the ouput power. Due to air flow, \n\ntemperature of the cells decreases during the flight and causes increased in efficiency. So \n\nthis would be a significant factor while designing the aircraft, selecting the cells and covering \n\nthe wings. Futhermore, this influences the weight, price and flight-endurance. \n\n \n\n8.2 Future Work \n\nIn the future, a better and more accurate technique for placing the solar cells inside the wings \n\nwill be studied.   \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\n1.
