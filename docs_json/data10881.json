The cultivation of irrigated rice could be an\nalternative, since ion uptake as well as leaching by the establishment of a water\nlayer could mitigate the effects of soil salinity.  This study aimed to evaluate the\ndynamics of basic cations in the solution of Albaqualf soils with different salinity\nlevels growing irrigated rice.  The plow layer contained exchangeable Na\npercentages (ESP) of 5.6, 9.0, 21.2 and 32.7 %.  The plant stand, dry matter, Na, K\nand Ca + Mg uptake at full flowering and grain yield were evaluated.  The levels of\nNa, K, Ca + Mg and electrical conductivity (EC) in the soil solution were also\nmeasured weekly during the rice cycle at four soil depths, in the water layer and\nirrigation water.  The Na, K and Ca + Mg uptake by rice at full flowering was used\nto estimate ion depletion from the layer under root influence.  Soil salinity induced\na reduction in the rice stand, especially in the soil with ESP of 32.7 %, resulting in\nlower cation uptake and very low yield at that site.  As observed in the water layer\nand irrigation water, the Na, K, Ca + Mg and EC levels in the soil solution decreased\nwith time at depths of 5, 10 and 20 cm, regardless of the original soil salinity, showing\nthat cation dynamics in the plow layer was determined by leaching and root uptake,\nrather than by the effect of evapoconcentration of basic cations in the soil surface\nlayer.\n\nIndex terms: exchangeable sodium percentage, potassium, calcium, magnesium,\nelectrical conductivity.\n\n(1) Part of the doctoral dissertation of first author, presented to the, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul \u2013 UFRGS.\nReceived for publication in August 2009 and approved in October 2010.\n\n(2) Agronomist, Doctoral candidate Programa de P\u00f3s Gradua\u00e7\u00e3o em Ci\u00eancia do Solo, UFRGS.

The yield varies\nregionally, although the applied technology levels are\nbasically the same.  On the Outer Coastal Plain, for\nexample, yields are lower compared to other regions,\nand, in the 2008/09 growing season, the average yield\nwas 6.8 Mg ha-1 in an area of 128,760 ha, but\n7.8 Mg ha-1 in an area exceeding 310,000 ha in\nFronteira Oeste (IRGA, 2009).  The discrepancies\nobserved between some regions may be attributed to\nthe different soil types (Streck et al., 2008), variation\nin solar radiation (Mota, 1995; Cust\u00f3dio, 2007) and\nregion-specific stress, such as soil and water salinity.\nIn this context, the lagoon Laguna dos Patos is highly\nimportant, because of its connection to the Atlantic\nOcean.  Laguna dos Patos is the main irrigation\nsource for rice crops in the coastal plains.  As a result,\nthe soils can be threatened by salt deposition at\nincompatible levels for rice cultivation.\n\nAside from the salts in irrigation water, soil\nsalinization in Rio Grande do Sul can have other\ncauses.  On the Outer Coastal Plain, the soil is\n\nconstantly evolving as a result of marine and fluvio-\nlacustrine sedimentation.  These sediments, which\nmay be more or less permeable, favor the groundwater\nflow, providing a reaction zone where the freshwater\nfrom the Laguna dos Patos and the salt water from\nthe sea flow together (Charette &amp; Sholkovitz, 2006).\nThe brackish water level in the soil profile moves in\nresponse to the seasonal water level of the Laguna\ndos Patos and the hydraulic gradient of groundwater\n(Niencheski et al., 2007).  At sites where the\ngroundwater is nearer the surface and depending on\nthe evaporation, salts can rise up to the plow layer.\n\nRice cultivation could be a viable alternative of\nreducing soil salinity, provided that good quality water\nis applied to the crop.  Although rice responds\nsensitively to salinity in the seedling stage, with plant\nstand reduction, and in the reproductive stage, with\nspikelet sterility (Ehrler, 1960; Zeng &amp; Shannon,\n2000), the establishment of a water layer favors salt\nleaching, especially Na, throughout the soil profile\n(Ponnamperuma, 1981).  Moreover, the proper crop\nuptake favors the removal of other salts from the\nsystem, since irrigated rice is highly demanding in\nK, Ca and Mg (Machado, 1983; Slaton et al., 2004).\nAlthough the soil characteristics determine the\nintensity of changes in the solution, the presence of\nplants influences the process, either by nutrient\n\n\n\nCATION DYNAMICS IN SOILS WITH DIFFERENT SALINITY LEVELS GROWING...                         1853\n\nR.

Grattan\net al. (2002), Boivin et al. (2002) and Schoenfeld et al.\n(2007) reported an increase in salinity in the surface\nlayer to a depth of 10 cm, as an effect of\nevapoconcentration.  Several factors may affect these\ndynamics, e.g., soil texture, CEC, soil porosity and\ndepth of the impermeable layer, as well as the\nexperimental environment.  Therefore, the question\narises whether rice cultivation can potentially increase\nor decrease soil salinity levels in the regions of the\nstate where the problem had already been reported.\n\nThis study aimed to monitor the influence of\nirrigated rice cultivation on the dynamics of basic\ncations and electrical conductivity in soils with\ndifferent salinity levels in the Outer Coastal Plain of\nRio Grande do Sul, Brazil.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nThe study was carried out on the Fazenda\nCavalhada, in Mostardas, in the rice region called\nOuter Coastal Plain (OCP), Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.\nOn the property, Albaqualf is the predominant soil\ntype (Streck et al., 2008) and rice has been grown for\nthe past 80 years.\n\nSoils with different salinity levels in the plow layer\nwere selected.  Salinity was expressed as the\npercentage of exchangeable Na percentage, according\nto the equation: ESP (%) = [(Na + / CECpH 7.0)] x 100.\nThe sampling sites were selected based on the previous\n\nanalysis of eight cropping areas, with and without\nhistory of salinity symptoms in rice plants,\ncharacterized by low tillering and high spikelet sterility\n(Ehrler, 1960).  At these sites, soil samples were taken\nfrom stratified layers of 0\u20135, 5\u201310, 10\u201320 and 20\u2013\n40 cm in an area of 40 m2.  Ten sub-samples were\ntaken to form one composite sample per layer per site.\nFrom these, four sites were selected with different\nESP in the 0\u201320 cm layer (Table 1).  Two areas were\nchosen representing the extremes, one area with\nintermediate ESP and one with high ESP.  The ESP\nin the 0\u201320 cm layer of the selected sites was 5.6 %\n(Casamento) where no salinity damage had been\nreported, 9.0 % (Cavalhada), with a history of uneven\ngermination, but without spikelet sterility; 21.2 %\n(Banhado), uneven germination and problems with\nspikelet sterility, and 32.7 % (Sinval), sparse rice\ngermination, high spikelet sterility and very low\nproductivity.\n\nThe rice variety IRGA 417 was grown at three sites:\nCavalhada, Banhado and Sinval. In Casamento, to a\nbetter control of red rice infestation, it was used the\nvariety IRGA 422 Clearfield\u00ae, which is an immediate\nparental of IRGA 417 (Lopes et al., 1993) from which\nit was derived in five backcrosses and therefore has\n97 % of the traits of IRGA 417. Sowing dates were\nNovember 1 (Cavalhada), November 8 (Banhado and\nSinval) and November 17, 2008 (Casamento).\n\nThe chemical attributes and clay content of soils\n(Tedesco et al., 1995) are shown in table 1.  No basal\nfertilization was applied, since the P levels were very\nhigh at the four sites (SOSBAI, 2007) and K, a study\nobject, was not applied so as not to interfere with the\ninterpretation of results.  Only urea topdressing\n\nTable 1. Chemical atributes of different sites and layers of the soils used in the experiment\n\n(1) Mehlich-1 method. (2) Ammonium acetate extractant, 1.0 mol L-1.

Two sources of good water quality\nwere used: the Lagoa do Casamento (Cavalhada and\nCasamento) and Lagoa dos Gateados (Banhado and\nSinval).  A water level of about 10 cm was maintained\nin the paddy fields until grain harvest.  The\nexperiments were performed in 12 m\u00b2 plots (4 x 3 m)\nwith a spacing of 0.5 m between plots and three\nreplications.  A rain gauge was installed at the\nheadquarters of the Fazenda Cavalhada,\napproximately equidistant from the four experimental\nareas.  The rainfall during the trial, in November\nand December 2008; and January and February 2009,\nis shown in table 2, which also contains the rainfall\ndata of the automatic weather station of the National\nInstitute of Meteorology (INMET) of the same period.\nThe maximum average rainfall in Mostardas was\npresented for comparison, which is also valid for the\nexperimental areas, based on isohyets on basic climate\nmaps (averages of 30 years) as well as average rainfall\n(11 years) in Tramanda\u00ed.  Mostardas and Tramanda\u00ed\nare 84 and 63 km away from the headquarters of the\nFazenda Cavalhada, respectively.\n\nPrior to irrigation in the experimental paddy fields,\nsoil solution collectors were installed at depths of 5,\n10, 20, and 40 cm.  The equipment consisted of a plastic\nhose (diameter 5 mm), connected to a collector PVC\ntube (diameter 25 mm, length 40 mm), covered with\nnylon mesh at the ends.  At the end of the hose surface,\napproximately 40 mL solution per depth was extracted\nwith 60 mL syringes (Silva et al., 2003).  The aliquots\nwere immediately placed in plastic tubes with a\nvacuum cap.  Sampling began on the seventh day\nafter irrigation started (7 DIS) until 91 DIS, in weekly\nintervals between collections.  The water layer and\nirrigation water were also sampled, until 84 DIS, when\nirrigation was interrupted.  The electrical conductivity\n(EC) of the samples was measured about four hours\nafter sampling.  Then the aliquots were acidified for\nlater analysis of Na, K, Ca, and Mg.\n\nThe stand of each site was evaluated when the\nplants reached V4.  The number of plants in two 1 m-\nlong rows was counted.  To assess dry matter, plant\nshoots were collected in 1 m segments, at full flowering\n(FF), 77 DIS.  The plants were dried in a forced-air\noven for 72 h to determine dry matter and the Na, K,\nCa and Mg shoot levels, as well as ion uptake.  Grain\nwas harvested from an area of 5 m\u00b2 (2 x 2.5 m) per\nplot.  The material was processed in a stationary\nthresher and the grain cleaned by sieving, weighed\nand the grain mass corrected to 13 % moisture.\n\nThe data of the soil solution, water layer and\nirrigation water were subjected to regression analysis.\nThe best-fitting polynomial equations were used.  The\nsignificance of the regression coefficients was\npresented at 10, 5 and 1 %, together with the\ncoefficients of determination.  To determine the ion\nbalance in the soil solution, as a function of plant\nuptake, the ion concentrations of the soil solution 7\n\nDIS was subtracted from the ion concentration 77\nDIS, when full flowering coincided at the four sites.\nThe average ion concentrations at depths of 5, 10 and\n20 cm were used, since about 90 % of the rice roots\nare concentrated in the 0\u201320 cm layer (Lopes et al.,\n1994; Teo et al., 1995; Abichequer, 2004).  Based on\nthe values of the ionic balance in the soil solution\nbetween 7 and 77 DIS and of the ion uptake 77 DIS,\nthe ion leaching loss was determined by the difference\nbetween these properties.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nPlant stand, dry biomass at full flowering\nand grain yield\n\nIn relation to the salinity levels evaluated, plant\nestablishment was best in Cavalhada, where the plant\nstand was higher than in Casamento (Table 3), with\nlowest levels of soil salinity (Table 1).  This may be\nexplained by the later sowing date in Casamento\n(November 17, 2008), when soil moisture conditions\nwere unfavorable, unlike the situation in Cavalhada\n(November 1, 2008), Banhado and Sinval (November\n8, 2008).  The reduced establishment in Banhado and,\nespecially, in Sinval may be attributed to the higher\nsoil salinity at these sites than in Casamento and\nCavalhada (Table 1).  Several studies (Oster et al.,\n1984; Shannon et al., 1998; Grattan et al., 2002)\nreported a decrease in plant stand, proportional to the\nsalinity level in soil as well as irrigation water and\nsoil solution.\n\nThe dry matter yield at full flowering was highest\nexactly at the lowest salinity level (Table 3).  However,\nthe higher yield in Banhado, at an ESP of 21.2 %,\n\n\n\nCATION DYNAMICS IN SOILS WITH DIFFERENT SALINITY LEVELS GROWING...                         1855\n\nR. Bras. Ci. Solo, 34:1851-1863, 2010\n\ncompared to Cavalhada, where the ESP was 9.0 %,\nwas not expected.  Similarly to observations related\nto the establishment, much less dry matter was\nproduced in Sinval than at the other locations (Table 3),\nin response to the higher soil salinity (Table 1).  Data\nrelated to grain yield are best related to the soil\nsalinity levels; the highest yield was obtained in\nCasamento and the lowest in Sinval (Table 3).  At the\nlowest salinity levels, productivity was very similar,\nbut in Banhado, although the plant stand was\nconsistent with high yield (Counce et al., 1989), grain\nproductivity was more than 1.0 Mg ha-1 lower,\ncompared to data observed in Casamento and\nCavalhada, which may reflect the ESP at that site\n(Table 1), above the critical level of 20 % established\nfor rice (Fairhurst et al., 2007).\n\nIon dynamics in soil solution and plant\nuptake\n\nThe Na contents in the soil solution (Figure 1),\nsimilarly to the dry soil contents (Table 1), increased\nwith the soil salinity level and depth.  In general, soil\nsolution contents decreased with the crop growth,\nexcept in Banhado (Figure 1c) at depths of 5 cm and\n20 cm, where the Na content remained relatively\nstable, with fluctuations over the rice cycle.  This\nreduction in Na concentration over time was also\nobserved in the water layer (Figure 2a), which was\nalso directly influenced by the soil salinity level\n(Table 1), since the irrigation water quality\n(Figure 2b) was good (maximum Na levels around\n0.3 cmolc L-1).  The Na levels in the water layer\ndecreased more intensely at the locations with initially\nhigher soil contents (Table 1) and became similar at\nthe end of the rice cycle.  The Na contents in the\nwater layer (Figure 2a) followed the same trend as in\nthe soil solution (Figure 1), demonstrating an\nequilibrium relationship, determined by the interface\nbetween the soil surface and water layer.  The\nincidence of regular rainfall throughout the study\nperiod, mainly in December 2008 and January and\nFebruary 2009, when rainfall was above average\n(Table 2), may have caused the decrease, due to\ndilution effect of Na in irrigation water at all sites\nbut Cavalhada (Figure 2b).\n\nThe physical action of roots increases permeability\nand hydraulic conductivity in the soil, facilitating Na\nleaching, which, together with the uptake of these\nions by rice, may have contributed to the decrease\nduring the rice cycle (McNeal et al., 1966), since a\npartial replacement of K by Na may occur at the\nuptake sites of rice roots (Castilhos et al., 1999).\nAdditionally, the high biological activity in the roots\nincreases CO2 concentration in the rhizosphere and,\ntogether with the dissolution of native soil carbonates,\nmay have moved part of the Na present at the root\nexchange sites, facilitating their output from the soil\nlayer influenced by the rhizosphere (Chhabra &amp; Abrol,\n1977).  Due to its high hydrated ionic radius, Na is a\ncation easily leached by the water flow.\n\nThe difference between Na levels in the soil solution\n7 DIS and 77 DIS was similar in Casamento,\nCavalhada and Banhado (Table 4).  The uptake of this\nion, however, was quite different at these three sites\nand highest in Banhado (Table 4).  The lowest uptake\nin Cavalhada can be partially explained by the lowest\ndry matter yield at full flowering.  Despite this\ndiscrepancy in Na uptake, the difference between the\nionic balance and Na uptake was positive and similar,\nindicating that at these three sites, 55\u201368 mg L-1 Na\nwas lost through leaching, without even taking a\npossible contribution of Na from the non-exchangeable\nfraction to the soil solution into account.  In Sinval,\nthe Na content reached 520 mg L-1.  The highest\nleaching at that site may have been stimulated by\nthe low Na uptake (Table 4), due to the low stand and\ndry matter yield (Table 3), and the high soil salinity\n(Table 1).\n\nAt a depth of 40 cm, the Na content in the soil\nsolution did not have standard performance at the\nsites evaluated, because, over time, Na content\nincreased in Casamento (Figure 1a) and Banhado\n(Figure 1c) and decreased in Sinval (Figure 1d).  In\nCasamento and Banhado, the increased levels in deeper\nlayers may have been due to a rise of the brackish\nwater level or to Na leaching (Table 4), originated from\nthe surface horizons.  In the case of Sinval, the\ndecrease in Na at all depths may be due to leaching of\nthis ion to deeper layers, which can occur if the\nimpermeable layer, a common feature of Albaqualfs,\nis located at a greater depth.\n\nAs no K fertilizer was added to the soil, the initial\nlevels (7 DIS) of this nutrient in the soil solution\n(Figure 3) must result from an equilibrium state\nbetween the cations of the soil (Table 1), since the\nplants were still undeveloped.  In this situation, the\nK content of the soil solution at different sites and\ndepths, relates to the Na content, which, due to mass\naction, causes K displacement from exchange sites in\nthe soil.  However, throughout the rice cycle, the K\nconcentration in the soil solution (Figure 3) decreased\nat all locations and depths.  The K content in the\nwater layer (Figure 4a) followed the same trend as\nobserved in the 5\u201320 cm layer, in Casamento,\n\nTable 3.

This\nincrease cannot be attributed to the contribution of K\n\nthrough irrigation water, in which K values were\nlowest exactly at the end of the rice cycle (Figure 4b).\nPotassium is not part of the structure of organic\ncompounds (Marschner, 1995), thus it is rapidly\n\nFigure 1.

Bras. Ci. Solo, 34:1851-1863, 2010\n\ndepletion was more pronounced at a depth of 20 cm\nfrom after the second sampling, 14 DIS (Figure 3).\nSimilar results were observed by Silva et al. (2003),\nwho studied the dynamics of cations of an Albaqualf\nand a Gley soil, with and without rice plants, and\nfound a K decrease in the 0\u201310 cm layer, caused by\nroot uptake.\n\nThe apex of K depletion in the soil solution,\nregardless of the original content in the soil, which\nwas highly variable (Table 1), occurred between 49\nand 84 DIS, when K levels increased slightly\n(Figure 3).  In that period, minimum values were null\nfor several weeks in the root growth layer (0\u201310 cm)\nin Casamento (Figure 3a), Cavalhada (Figure 3b) and\nBanhado (Figure 3c), where rice establishment was\nnot as severely affected (Table 3).\n\nThe difference in the amount of K between 7 and\n77 DIS and the K uptake by plants was negative at\nall sites (Table 4), indicating a contribution of non-\nexchangeable K to plant nutrition, especially in areas\nwith higher growth (Casamento, Cavalhada and\nBanhado - Table 3).  Despite the tiny plant stand in\nSinval, K uptake was also sufficient to contribute with\nnon-exchangeable K forms (Table 4).  Higher plants\nhave extremely efficient mechanisms to take up K,\neven at low concentrations in the soil solution\n(Gommers et al., 2005).  This generates a gradient\ntoward the roots, creating a favorable environment\nfor the release of non-exchangeable K forms, causing\na permanent buffering of exchangeable and non-\nexchangeable K forms, adsorbed with both low and\nhigh bond energy in the clay interlayers, or in primary\nminerals (Kaminski et al., 2007).  Castilhos &amp; Meurer\n(2002) and Fraga et al. (2009) demonstrated the\ncontribution of non-exchangeable K forms to nutrition\nof rice grown in pots with different soil types.  The\nchange of exchangeable to non-exchangeable K may\nbe rapid (Rosolem et al., 2006), especially when the K\nconcentration in the soil solution is very low.\nHowever, the peak of K uptake by rice takes place\nfrom the panicle differentiation, i.e., about 35 to 40 days\nafter the beginning of flooding in early-maturing\ncultivars, and drops dramatically after full flowering\n(Lopes et al., 1994).  Consequently, it would be expected\nhere that K levels in the soil solution would increase\nas of 77 DIS, when the plants\u2019 avidity for nutrients\ndecreases, which occurred only 84 DIS, a period that\ncoincides with the senescence phase of rice leaves\n(Ookawa et al., 2003) and with rainfall (Table 2),\nwhich allowed \u201cK washing\u201d from leaves.\n\nNegative values for the difference between the K\namount in the soil solution in the 20 cm layer, and K\nuptake by plants hinders K leaching in these soils,\ncontrary to what was observed with Na (Table 4).\nHowever, the decrease in K concentration at all sites\nat a depth of 40 cm (Figure 3), therefore out of reach\nof most roots, suggests that there may have been K\nleaching.  The data reported by Beltrame et al. (1991)\nconfirm this interpretation; the authors observed\ncumulative K losses of 65.5 kg ha-1 in the 20\u201330 cm\n\nrecycled after leaf senescence.  Costa et al. (2009)\nobserved K accumulation in the vicinity of maize plants\nand a proportional decrease of K concentration with\nincreasing distance from the sowing line, a behavior\nknown as \u201cK washing\u201d (Klepker &amp; Anghinoni, 1995).\nThus, the element may have drained from the rice\ntissues and deposited in the water layer.  This can be\nproved by the dynamics of this nutrient at the site\nwith the highest salinity level (Sinval - Figure 4a),\nwhere there was very little development of plants\n(Table 3).  In this case, there was a slight increase in\nK content in the water layer from 84 DIS (Figure 4a).\nThe increase of K in the water layer can also be\nattributed to increased levels in the solution at the\nend of the cycle (Figure 3), due to the equilibrium of\nthe water layer and the soil solution.\n\nHowever, an increase of K concentration in the\nsoil solution was expected in the first weeks, because\nof the biochemical changes caused by flooding.  After\nirrigation, oxygen is rapidly consumed and the\nanaerobic microorganisms use oxidised soil\ncompounds as electron acceptors, including nitrate\nand iron and Mn oxides (Ponnamperuma, 1972).  The\nsoil solution composition would therefore change by\nan increase of Fe2+, Mn2+ and NH4+ levels, causing a\ndisplacement of other cations to the solution, such as\nK (DeDatta, 1983), increasing the plant availability\nand leaching losses, which are significantly higher\nwhen the rice fields are continuously flooded (Santos\net al., 2002).  The presence of plants, however,\nappeared to prevent this phenomenon, since K\n\nTable 4.

These effects\nwere also observed in the water layer (Figure 6a) and\nwere not related to irrigation water (Figure 6b), in\nwhich nutrient contents were similarly low and\nunchanged throughout the rice cycle.\n\nAt the two sites with lowest soil salinity\n(Casamento and Cavalhada), there was also an\nincrease in Ca + Mg concentrations in soil solution at\na depth of 40 cm (Figure 5a,b).  This may be due to\nleaching from the upper layers, or to desorption of\nCa + Mg ions, caused by Fe2+ and Mn2+ replacement\nat the exchange sites, as a result of redox reactions\ncaused by flooding (DeDatta, 1983).  Increasing the\nCa and Mg concentration in flooded soil solutions may\nhave been the cause of the negative values observed\nfor the difference between the amount of Ca + Mg in\n\nthe soil solution and plant uptake in Cavalhada and\nespecially in Casamento, where the uptake was much\nhigher than at the other sites (Table 4).\n\nIn a study performed in flooded Albaqualfs without\nrice plants, Sousa et al. (2002) found an increase in\nCa and Mg in the soil solution until 35 DIS followed\nby a decrease until stability.  Similar results were\nobtained by Silva et al. (2003), with and without rice\nplants.  However, both studies were performed in pots,\nwhich prevented a downward hydraulic flow that could\nleach these elements deeper, as shown by Santos et\nal. (2002), in a field trial, at a depth of 60 cm.  Thus,\nin the present study, it can be inferred that Ca and\nMg depletion (Figure 5) was mainly due to leaching,\nsince the highest losses were observed in the two areas\nof highest salinity (Figure 5c,d).  The positive and\nsimilar values of the difference between the amount\nof Ca + Mg in solution and plant uptake, observed in\nBanhado and Sinval, indicate a significant leaching\nloss of Ca + Mg.  This is mostly due to the high levels\nof these elements in the soil solution in the first days\n\nFigure 5.

For being less required by\nrice, the depletion of Ca and Mg in the soil solution\nwas less marked than of K, which virtually\ndisappeared from the soil solution in some cases\n(Figure 3a,c).\n\nThe electrical conductivity (EC) of the soil solution,\ndetermined by the ion concentration, especially of Na,\nfollowed a similar trend to that of basic ions.  It\nincreased with the level of soil salinity (Table 1) and\ndecreased throughout the rice cycle at all sites, in the\n0\u201320 cm soil layer (Figure 7).  At 40 cm depth, EC\ndecreased in the soil solution in Cavalhada and Sinval\n(Figure 7b,d) and was constant in Casamento and\nBanhado (Figure 7a,c).  Similar to the basic cations,\nthe EC of the water layer (Figure 8a) was related to\nthe EC of the soil solution, decreasing during the crop\ncycle, proportionally to the soil salinity level, but not\nto the EC of the irrigation water (Figure 8b).  The\nsmall decrease in EC at two locations (Banhado and\nSinval) was probably due to a dilution effect caused\nby regular rainfall (Table 2), as mentioned above.\n\nThe variable EC is used to monitor soil salinity,\ndue to the practicality of measurement and high\ncorrelation with the amount of soluble salts, since it\nrepresents the phenomenon of transfer of electric\ncurrent exerted by charged particles, ionic solutes\n(cations and anions) and colloids on a force applied to\nan electric field.  In general, the EC of soils increases\nafter flooding, reaching a maximum and decreasing\nto stable values (Ponnamperuma, 1972).  This was\nhowever not observed in this study, which reflects\nthe cation dynamics (Figures 1, 3 and 5) with generally\nlower contents in the topsoil.  The reduction in EC\nwas most significant in the soil with highest salinity\n(Sinval - Figure 7d), similar Na (Figure 1d).  In\nSinval, however, the EC levels remained above\n3.0 dS m-1, a level considered harmful to rice (Ayers\n&amp; Westcot, 1985), at all depths.\n\nIon mobilization during the first weeks of flooding\ncauses an increase in EC, which varies according to\nthe soil type.  In soils with higher CEC, this process\ntends to be stimulated.  Boivin et al. (2002), for example,\nnoted an increase in EC from 0.3 to 1.2 dS m-1, during\na rice cycle in a Vertisol, richer in cations than the\nAlbaqualf used in this study.  However, these authors\nstudied an African region characterized by a negative\nannual water balance (2,000 mm), with average\nrainfall of 280 mm in the rainy season (July-October)\nduring the rice cycle.  Rice cultivation in the low-\nrainfall period may not allow the dilution of salts\ncontained in the irrigation and soil solution water.\nThis climate pattern is antagonistic to that observed\nat the site in Mostardas, where rainfall was\ndistributed regularly throughout the experiment\n(Table 2), favoring the reduction of EC in both the\nwater layer (Figure 8a) and irrigation water\n(Figure 8b).  However, in both cases, the values were\nsimilar at the end of the rice cycle.\n\nIn pot experiments, rice transpiration induces a\nhydraulic gradient toward the roots, which mainly\ngoverns the dynamics of soil EC, since plant\ndevelopment causes a greater accumulation of ions in\nthe topsoil, due to the effect of evapoconcentration in\nthe rhizosphere.  This phenomenon usually occurs\nnear the period of panicle differentiation of rice, when\nnutrient uptake is highest (Lopes et al., 1993).  In a\nstudy on different soil types, including an Albaqualf,\nSchoenfeld et al. (2007) observed a sharp EC increase\nat depths of 5 and 10 cm 42 DIS, precisely because of\nthe increased transpiratory demand in this period.\nSimilar dynamics were observed by Sousa et al. (2002),\nfor K, Ca and Mg, 35 DIS.  In rice cultivated in pots\nbut with outflow of leachates, Chhabra &amp; Abrol (1977)\nfound a drastic reduction in the salinity of a highly\nsalty soil, as in the present field study.  This showed\n\nFigure 6.
