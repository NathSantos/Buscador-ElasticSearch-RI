O meu supervisor de est\u00e1gio foi o \n\nespecialista em \u201cpore pressure\u201d, Eng.\u00ba Tristan Cornu da Total EP Angola e o supervisor externo \n\nfoi o Doutor Jos\u00e9 Ant\u00f3nio de Almeida da Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias e Tecnologia - Universidade \n\nNova de Lisboa. O est\u00e1gio foi realizado no Departamento de Dire\u00e7\u00e3o de Explora\u00e7\u00e3o / \n\nsubsuperf\u00edcie da Total EP Angola. \n\nEm primeiro lugar quero agradecer a Total EP Angola pela oportunidade do est\u00e1gio e finalizar a \n\nminha tese de mestrado nas suas instala\u00e7\u00f5es. Agrade\u00e7o ao meu supervisor Eng.\u00ba Cornu, que me \n\nexplicou pacientemente muitos detalhes t\u00e9cnicos e me apoiou nos momentos dif\u00edceis do est\u00e1gio. \n\nAgrade\u00e7o ao meu grande amigo e colega Erik Ferreira por me ter apresentado a Total EP \n\nAngola.  \n\nAos meus pais e irm\u00e3os pelo apoio e compreens\u00e3o pela minha aus\u00eancia nos momentos em que a \n\nminha presen\u00e7a era fundamental. \n\nAgrade\u00e7o a todos os meus professores no Departamento de Ci\u00eancias da Terra, pelos \n\nensinamentos, conselhos e pelas oportunidades que me foram dadas durante a forma\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nacad\u00e9mica. Destaco os meus agradecimentos ao professor Doutor Jos\u00e9 Carlos Kullberg por me \n\nter ajudado na conclus\u00e3o da minha licenciatura e o professor Doutor Jos\u00e9 Ant\u00f3nio de Almeida \n\npela co-supervis\u00e3o do meu mestrado e revis\u00e3o do documento final. \n\nN\u00e3o posso esquecer de agradecer \u00e0 minha grande amiga Marisa Manuel, que tanto desejou ver \n\nos meus estudos em Portugal conclu\u00eddos e ansiosamente aguarda pelo meu regresso a Angola. \n\nH\u00e1 muitas outras pessoas que foram fundamentais nos meus estudos em Portugal para \n\nmencionar, mas no meu \u00edntimo eu os agrade\u00e7o bastante. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nV \n\n \n\nRESUMO \n\n \n\nA presente disserta\u00e7\u00e3o de mestrado baseia-se no est\u00e1gio curricular feito na empresa Total EP \n\nAngola entre Julho e Dezembro de 2013. Os dados apresentados s\u00e3o relativos a um caso de \n\nestudo real de um bloco de explora\u00e7\u00e3o, que por raz\u00f5es de confidencialidade tem a designa\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nbloco Michocho. \n\nA medi\u00e7\u00e3o press\u00e3o dos fluidos nas forma\u00e7\u00f5es rochosas pode ser inferida, a partir dos logs de \n\nresistividade das forma\u00e7\u00f5es. Em po\u00e7os n\u00e3o perpendiculares \u00e0s camadas rochosas, as curvas de \n\nresistividade apresentam valores mais elevados do que o esperado devido ao efeito anisotr\u00f3pico \n\ndas forma\u00e7\u00f5es, portanto a infer\u00eancia da press\u00e3o dos flu\u00eddos a partir destas resistividades pode \n\nconduzir a valores irrealistas. A maioria dos po\u00e7os de desenvolvimento perfurados no bloco \n\nMichocho em Angola s\u00e3o altamente desviados, se n\u00e3o forem sub-horizontais, na sec\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\nreservat\u00f3rio.  O objetivo deste trabalho \u00e9 corrigir o efeito anisotr\u00f3pico da resistividade devido \u00e0 \n\ninclina\u00e7\u00e3o do po\u00e7o em rela\u00e7\u00e3o as forma\u00e7\u00f5es atravessadas. A corre\u00e7\u00e3o da resistividade neste \n\nestudo \u00e9 baseada na f\u00f3rmula proposta por Moran e Gianzero em 1979 e envolve a inclina\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nferramenta de indu\u00e7\u00e3o e o coeficiente de anisotropia da forma\u00e7\u00e3o rochosa. \n\nPara a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o desta f\u00f3rmula nos logs de resistividade dos po\u00e7os do bloco Michocho fizeram-\n\nse, em primeiro lugar, testes de valida\u00e7\u00e3o. Por falta de dados nos po\u00e7os de desenvolvimento \n\n(po\u00e7os muito inclinados), o teste de valida\u00e7\u00e3o foi efetuado em cinco po\u00e7os de explora\u00e7\u00e3o, onde \n\nse tem dispon\u00edveis logs de resistividades nas duas dire\u00e7\u00f5es principais. Assumiu-se que a \n\nf\u00f3rmula seria aprovada para a corre\u00e7\u00e3o da resistividade se a resistividade horizontal obtida pela \n\nf\u00f3rmula tivesse boa correspond\u00eancia com a resistividade horizontal obtida pela ferramenta de \n\nindu\u00e7\u00e3o de logs. Posteriormente \u00e0 valida\u00e7\u00e3o, fez-se a calibra\u00e7\u00e3o do coeficiente de anisotropia a \n\nser usado na f\u00f3rmula e corrigiram-se as curvas de resistividades dos po\u00e7os de desenvolvimento, \n\nestes muito desviados em rela\u00e7\u00e3o as camadas rochosas.  \n\nAs resistividades corrigidas permitem a previs\u00e3o da press\u00e3o dos fluidos nas forma\u00e7\u00f5es rochosas, \n\nonde o principal objetivo \u00e9 identificar forma\u00e7\u00f5es de baixa permeabilidade que s\u00e3o zonas onde a \n\npress\u00e3o dos fluidos \u00e9 mais elevada (Overpressure). Para ilustrar esta etapa, escolheu-se uma \n\ncurva de resistividade de um dos po\u00e7os de explora\u00e7\u00e3o e calculou-se a press\u00e3o dos fluidos em \n\nforma\u00e7\u00f5es de baixa permeabilidade utilizando a f\u00f3rmula proposta por Eaton, 1975. Com estes \n\ndados identificou-se uma potencial ocorr\u00eancia de sobrepress\u00f5es, situa\u00e7\u00e3o que deve ser evitada \n\nna perfura\u00e7\u00e3o de po\u00e7os. \n\nPalavras-chave: reservat\u00f3rios petr\u00f3leo; press\u00e3o dos fluidos; logs de resistividade; anisotropia \n\ndas forma\u00e7\u00f5es; corre\u00e7\u00e3o da resistividade. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nVII \n\nABSTRACT \n\n \n\nThis dissertation is based on a curricular training period done at company Total EP Angola \n\nbetween July and December 2013. The data presented relate to a real case study of an \n\nexploration block, which for reasons of confidentiality is designated by Block Michocho. \n\nThe fluids pressure measurement in the geological formations can be inferred from the \n\nformation resistivity log. In not perpendicular wells to the layers, resistivity curves show higher \n\nvalues than the expected due to the anisotropic effect of the formation thus the inference of the \n\npressure of fluids from resistivity logs can lead to unrealistic values. Most of the developments \n\nwells drilled on Block Michocho in Angola are highly deviated, if not sub-horizontal, in the \n\nreservoir section. The objective of this work is to correct the anisotropic effect of the resistivity \n\nof Block Michocho due to non-perpendicularity of the wells when intersect the geological \n\nformations. In this study, the correction of the resistivity is based on the formula proposed by \n\nMoran and Gianzero in 1979 and involves the dipping angle of the induction logging tool and \n\nthe coefficient of anisotropy of the rock formation. \n\nPrior to application of this formula for the corrections of resistivity of the Block Michocho wells \n\nlogs, a set of validation tests were made. Due to lack of data on development wells (highly \n\ninclined wells) the validation test was carried out in five exploration wells where resistivity is \n\navailable in the two principal directions. It was assumed that the formula would be approved for \n\nresistivity corrections if the horizontal resistivity obtained by the formula had a good \n\ncorrespondence with the horizontal resistivity obtained by the induction logging tool. After this \n\nvalidation step, the coefficient of anisotropy to be used in the formula was calibrated as well as \n\nthe correction of the curves of resistivity of the remaining development wells, those much more \n\ndiverted regarding the rock layers. \n\nThe corrected resistivity can be applied for pore pressure prediction in low permeability rock \n\nformations, in which the main objective is to identify regions where fluid pressure is higher than \n\nnormal pressure, i.e. overpressure regions. For illustration purposes, a resistivity curve from an \n\nexploration well was chosen and the pressure of the fluids in low permeability rocks was \n\ncomputed by using the formula proposed by Eaton in 1975. With this well data, a potential \n\noverpressure region was identified and should be avoided in drilling activities. \n\n \n\nKey-words: oil reservoir; fluids pressure; resistivity logs; geological formation anisotropy; \n\ncorrection of resistivity. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nVIII \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nIX \n\n \n\nINDEX \n\n \n\n1.

INTRODUCTION \n\nThe resistivity is a measure used to infer pore pressures lithology in depth, once it is not \n\npossible to measure the pressure directly from the rock formations. In deviated wells, due to the \n\nlack of logs data available in the non-reservoir zones, it is difficult to follow-up continuously \n\nthe pressure. \n\nThe resistivity and gamma ray are both usually some of the available well logs, and those data \n\nare often used for reservoir characterization and modelling (Luis &amp; Almeida, 1996; Da Costa e \n\nSilva et al, 1997; Almeida, 2010; Quental et al, 2012; Kuznetsova et al, 2014; Alves et al, \n\n2014). But resistivity measurements are affected by wells deviations mainly in the low \n\npermeability zones. Hence, to use resistivity for pressure predictions, it is necessary to correct \n\nthe anisotropy generated by the deviation of the wells and make use of an apparent angle. \n\nThe correction of anisotropy in the resistivity must be done just in low permeability rock \n\nformations, such as mudstone and shale. \n\n If corrections are not made to resistivity, anisotropy and dip may cause erroneous induction log \n\ninterpretation (Klein, 1993). \n\nThe first and main objective of the work is to test a methodology to correct resistivity from \n\nanisotropy generated by the apparent angle of intersection between the wells and the geological \n\nformations (dip plus deviation). In order to validate the proposed method of correction of \n\nanisotropy, a set of wells with logs data from log while drilling (LWD) and wireline (WL) were \n\nused. The study is addressed to real data from a block renamed to Block Michocho, and were \n\ntested and validated with five exploration wells closer to the operated fields. \n\nThe methodology proposed for correction of the anisotropy is based on a model given by Moran \n\nand Gianzero (1979) in the paper \u201cInduction Log Anisotropy Corrections\u201d written by James \n\nD.Klein (Klein, 1993).  \n\nThis model assumes a laminated sand-shale sequence inclined to the wellbore with isotropic \n\nsand layers and anisotropic shale layers, and includes two levels of anisotropy at macroscopic \n\nand microscopic scale. The model assumes that the thicknesses of the individual sand and shale \n\nbeds are lower than can be captured by induction logging tools. The parameters of the model are \n\ndip angle, sand resistivity, volume of laminar shale, shale longitudinal resistivity, and shale \n\ncoefficient of anisotropy. \n\nThe deviation of the geological structure in vertical wells can also generate erroneous i.e. this \n\ndeviation is relative. The model applies only to laminated formations with bed thicknesses less \n\n\n\n \n\n2 \n\nthan the tool resolution. The preferred lithologies for pore pressure interpretation are shale and \n\nmudstones because they are more responsive to overpressure than most rock types.  \n\nIn this study, the corrected resistivity logs will be used in the pore pressure prediction to find \n\nalong depth water reservoir, oil reservoir, overpressures zones, and it will help in the design of \n\nthe well, and in the determination of the mud weight to drill, once there is a hazard associated to \n\nthe drilling in overpressure zones. \n\nThe hazards of pore pressure concern in pressure fluids within low permeability rock formations \n\nhigher than normal pressure (hydrostatic) which can be termed overpressure. Abnormal \n\npressures, particularly overpressure, can greatly increase drilling non-productive time and cause \n\nserious drilling incidents (e.g., well blowouts, pressure kicks, and fluid influx) if the abnormal \n\npressures are not predicted before drilling and while drilling. Pressure prediction is fundamental \n\nfor drilling activities. \n\nThe pore pressure gradient is used in drilling engineering due to the convenience of determining \n\nmud weight as is shown in Figure 1.1. The pore pressure gradient at a given depth is the pore \n\npressure divided by the true vertical depth (TVD). The mud weight should be appropriately \n\nselected based on pore pressure gradient, wellbore stability and fracture gradient prior to setting \n\nand cementing a casing. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 Pore pressure gradient, proper mud weight to stabilize the wellbore, fracture gradient, \n\noverburden stress gradient and casing shoes with depth.( Source: Zhang, 2011) \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nThe drilling fluid (mud) is applied in the form of mud pressure to support the wellbore walls and \n\nfor preventing influx and wellbore collapse during drilling. In order to avoid fluid influx, kicks \n\nand wellbore instability in an open hole section, a heavier mud pressure than the pore pressure is \n\nneeded. When mud weight is higher than the fracture gradient of the drilling section, it may \n\nfracture the formation, causing losses or even lost circulation. To prevent wellbore from \n\nhydraulic fracturing by the high mud weight , as needed where there is overpressure , casing \n\nneeds to be set to protect the overlying formations from fracturing, as illustrated in figure 1.1. \n\nFirst, predictions are usually done from sonic or velocity logs, which are data available before \n\nand during drilling in order to determine the pressure in depth, particularly in low permeability \n\nrock formations. \n\nResistivity is the measure used to infer fluid pressures in this study. However, resistivity from a \n\nhigh deviated well must be corrected due to its anisotropic effects. Most of development wells \n\nare highly deviated, if not sub-horizontal, in the reservoir section. and A proposed correction of \n\nanisotropy is presented in Figure 1.2 below, in which a hypothetical corrected resistivity of a \n\ndevelopment well termed Dona 761 was performed through the equation given by Moran and \n\nGianzero (1979). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2 The first plot (left) shows the observed resistivity and its trajectory with burial. The second \n\nplot (middle) represents the inclination of the well vs burial around 90\u00ba. A correction of resistivity is \n\nrepresented in the third plot (right), as well as the comparison with the observed resistivity. \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nDona 761 well is a development well with 80\u00ba deviation. The inclination angle of the well has \n\nan impact upon the observed resistivity values as it can be seen in Figure 1.2. It appears that the \n\nhypothetical corrected resistivity is the more appropriate method to infer pressure prediction \n\nattenuating the anisotropy effect observed in tool resistivity.  \n\nThis work is based on this type of correction, through a prior validation step using logs of data \n\nof five exploration wells with different inclination angles.  \n\nThis study is divided into five chapters:  \n\n? The first chapter presents a bibliography synthesis that addresses overpressure, normal \n\ncompaction trend, pore pressure prediction, anisotropy and its correction, and an \n\nexplanation of the induction of gamma ray and resistivity logs. This chapter shows \n\nshortly the problem of resistivity corrections from log well data and relate all these \n\nterms to the case study. \n\n? Second chapter presents the method of correction of the anisotropy and the test of \n\nvalidation of the correction on exploration wells. It also quantifies and qualifies the \n\ninfluence of anisotropy on Block Michocho. In order to validate test findings, this \n\nchapter also explains how the equation of correction of the anisotropy in the fields of \n\nthe block is checked. \n\n? Third chapter discusses the possibility of calibrating the coefficient of anisotropy \n\nusing the normal compaction of the fields of Block Michocho and the application of \n\ncorrection on deviated development wells. \n\n? Fourth chapter addresses the application of the pore pressure prediction method in the \n\nLango well and a discussion of benefits and disadvantages of the using corrected \n\nresistivity. \n\n? Finally, fifth chapter presents conclusions about the work and recommendations about \n\nusing the study\u2019s method to correct anisotropy. \n\nAs to the parameters implied in this work, this study refers to the technical reports of the \n\nrespective exploration wells from TEPA, in order to understand the lithology of Block \n\nMichocho. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n2. METHODS \n\nThis section details from a theoretic point of view a set of concepts to introduce the problem and \n\nthe solutions proposed for correction of resistivity in the present case study. \n\n \n\n2.1 Overpressure \n\nThe overpressure is a problematic issue during drilling in the petroleum\u2019s industry. It can be \n\nunderstood as an abnormal pressure, which concerns in a pressure higher than normal or \n\nhydrostatic pressure in the formations as we can see in Figure 2.1. Normal pressure is defined as \n\nthe weight of the water column that comes from surface. Pressure below hydrostatic is called \n\nunderpressure and it will not be discussed in this report. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 Hydrostatic pressure vs depth, underpressure and overpressure. (source: Swarbrick and \n\nOsborne, 1998) \n\n \n\nIn terms of dynamics of the subsurface fluid flow, overpressure is defined as inability of the \n\nformation fluids to escape. This retention of fluids can result in disequilibrium states of \n\npressure, and to control that phenomenon it is very important to check the permeability and \n\nbehaviour of rock seal. \n\nThere are many basins in the world containing overpressured reservoirs and the age of the rocks \n\nin which overpressures have been recognized ranges from Pleistocene to Cambrian (Swarbrick \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nand Osborne, 1998). The carbonated rocks and clastic reservoirs are materials in which \n\noverpressure is found and it is in rocks deposited too deeper the sedimentary basins. \n\nThe hydrostatic line in Figure 2.1 corresponds to single overburden stress, and pressure \n\nincreases linearly with depth. The mechanisms responsible for overpressure are \n\nundercompaction, fluid expansion, lateral transfer and tectonic loading (Bowers, 2002); \n\ncompaction disequilibrium or undercompaction and fluid volume expansion during gas \n\ngeneration are the ones with more magnitude.  \n\nUndercompaction results from low permeability rocks (high sedimentation rates). Increase in \n\nvertical stress during loading can lead to incomplete dewatering of the sediment when part of \n\nthe weight of the load is added to the pore-fluid pressure. This is commonly termed \n\n\u201cundercompaction\u201d. \n\nOverpressure due to compaction disequilibrium is often recognized by higher porosity than \n\nexpected at a given depth. Porosity can be considered as a function of the overburden stress and \n\nthe effective stress. If all the fluid is retained the porosity and effective stress remain constant \n\nwith depth. Conditions that favour compaction disequilibrium are rapid burial and low \n\npermeability rocks. \n\nCompaction disequilibrium is therefore likely to be found in thick clay and shale successions \n\nduring continuous rapid burial (England et al, 1987). Overpressure in adjacent, high \n\npermeability reservoir rocks will result from isolation of the reservoir within the low-\n\npermeability section. \n\nTo characterize compaction disequilibrium, we must study the plots of pressure vs depth \n\nthrough fluid retention depth where overpressure begins and increases downwards along a \n\ngradient, which can closely follow the lithostatic (overburden) gradient. \n\nFluid expansion creates overpressure in low permeability rocks, where pore fluid volume \n\nincreases with minimal change in porosity and a rate which does not permit effective dissipation \n\nof fluids. \n\nOverpressure can be generated within the pore space by fluid expansion mechanisms such as \n\nheating, hydrocarbon maturation, and the expulsion/expansion of intergranular water during \n\nclay diagenesis (Bowers, 1995). When such events occur, overpressure results from the rock \n\nmatrix constraining the pore fluids as the fluids try to increase in volume. Fluids pressure within \n\nrock formation cannot be measured directly, but it can be inferred.  \n\nSome log parameters allow the inference of pore pressures within rock formation. These log \n\nparameters are density, sonic velocity and resistivity. Just as in an overpressure situation, which \n\nappears in rock formations with low permeability, log parameters can infer pressure indirectly \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nidentifying shale layers. When pore pressure in shale formations using log parameters are \n\ninferred, the trend of the normal curve increases with depth. At a certain depth of the normal \n\ncurves of these parameters that, is supposed to increase with depth, the pressure decreases. This \n\nmeans that pore pressure in this zone is higher than normal pressure, which corresponds to the \n\nnormal curve. The subchapter 2.4 discusses this method in more detail. \n\n \n\n2.2 Normal Compaction Trend \n\nThe compaction trend is related to the normal behaviour of porosity with depth. Normally with \n\ndepth, the weight above sediments, that is termed overburden stress, increases and the \n\ncompaction of the sediments increases, too. \n\nPorosity usually decreases with depth due to compaction. This occurs when the sedimentation \n\nrate is slow i.e., the equilibrium between increasing overburden and the reduction of pore fluid \n\nvolume due to compaction or ability to expel fluids is maintained (Mouchet and Mitchell, \n\n1989). This usual compaction generates hydrostatic pore pressure in the formation. Therefore, \n\nthe deeper the sediment is buried, the higher the overburden stress and the associated \n\ncompaction. \n\nDuring burial of sediments, if compaction increases continuously and porosity decreases, fluids \n\ndewater with burial, this behaviour can be a linear trend, which is called by normal compaction \n\ntrend line. When normal compaction is increasing with depth, there are zones in which \n\nsedimentation does not undergo the same process: porosity does not decrease as would be \n\nexpected. In such zones, a phenomenon called compaction disequilibrium or undercompaction \n\noccurs. In zones characterized by compaction disequilibrium, fluids are trapped in low \n\npermeability formations with pressure higher than hydrostatic pressure. \n\nFor in a given log, representative of porosity, the normal compaction trend is used to deduce \n\nabnormal pressure zones in the shale. In order to predict pore pressure build-up in sediments \n\ndue to compaction disequilibrium, it is necessary to establish a trend curve for porosity versus \n\ndepth due to normal compaction. One commonly approach is based on porosity versus depth \n\nrelationship Athy (1930): \n\n    \n \n          (1) \n\nWhere   is porosity;  \n \n is the porosity in the mudline;   is the true vertical depth below the \n\nmudline; and   is the compaction constant in 1/m or 1/ft.  \n\nAs with porosity, resistivity is also used to infer fluids. As porosity, decreases with burial, \n\nresistivity increases in the shale along depth. The function of the normal compaction trend line \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nacts as a reference in the measuring resistivity to help to make a better interpretation on the \n\nstudy of pore pressure prediction being resistivity a parameter of control. \n\nIt should be noted that pore pressure in the formation near the wellbore is affected by drilling-\n\ninduced stresses (Zhang and Roegiers, 2005). Therefore, in order to obtain formation pore \n\npressure the deep resistivity is also required for calculations of the pore pressure. Figure 2.2 \n\ndemonstrates the normal compaction trend line. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2 Normal compaction trendline according to resistivity versus depth. Red line is shale resistivity \n\nand black line is normal resistivity (Rn) (Source: Zhang, 2011). \n\n \n\nThe resistivity varies according to depth as can be seen in Figure 2.2. At depths less than 4900ft \n\nbelow the sea floor the formation is in normal compaction. From 4900 to 7600ft, the formation \n\nis slightly under-compacted with lower resistivity than the normal compaction trend, implying \n\nthat the pore pressures increases according to Eaton\u2019s theory. From 7600 to 13000ft, the \n\nformation is further under-compacted and more elevated pore pressures exist. Figure 2.2 also \n\ndemonstrates that the adapted Eaton\u2019s resistivity method gives a good result in pore pressure \n\ncalculation. \n\nIt is difficult to determine normal shale resistivity or shale resistivity in the condition of \n\nhydrostatic pore pressure. One approach is to assume that normal shale resistivity is a constant, \n\nbut this does not work in most cases. However, normal resistivity (Rn) is a function of the burial \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\ndepth, as shown in Figure 2.2. Hence, the normal compaction trendline needs to be determined \n\nfor pore pressure prediction. \n\nBased on the relationship of measured resistivity and burial depth in the formations with \n\nhydrostatic pressures, the following equation of the normal compaction trend of resistivity can \n\nbe used:  \n\n      \n        (2) \n\nWhere    is the shale resistivity with normal compaction condition;    is the shale resistivity in \n\nthe mudline;   is the constant; and   is the depth below the mudline. \n\n \n\n2.3 Pore Pressure Prediction \n\nPore pressure is also known as formation pressure and is related to interstitial fluids that \n\npercolate within the rocks formations. Hydrostatic pressure occurs when the pressure within the  \n\nformations is equal to the pressure in the column of water that extends to the surface. When the \n\nfluid pressure in the sediment with low permeability (shale or mudstones) is greater than normal \n\npressure, overpressure zones are present.  \n\nFor a driller\u2019s geologists, it is important to know pore pressure within formations to determine \n\nthe mud weight required to drill future wells safely. \n\nThe fundamental theory for pore pressure prediction is based on Terzaghi\u2019s and Biot\u2019s effective \n\nstress law (Biot, 1941; Terzaghi et al, 1996). This theory argues that pore pressure in the \n\nformation is a function of total stress (overburden stress) and effective stress. The overburden \n\nstress, effective vertical stress and pore pressure can be estimated by:  \n\n  \n      \n\n \n (3) \n\nWhere   is the pore pressure;    is the overburden stress;    is the vertical effective stress; and \n\n  is the Biot effective coefficient. It is conventionally assumed that  =1. \n\nWhen overburden stress and effective stresses are known, pore pressure can be calculated from \n\nequation (3). Overburden stress can be easily obtained from bulk density logs, while effective \n\nstress can be correlated to well log data, such as resistivity, sonic velocity, bulk density and \n\ndrilling parameters.  \n\nThe pore pressure profile is similar to many geologically young sedimentary basins where \n\nundercompaction is the major cause of overpressure that can be encountered at a certain depth.  \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nIn Figure 2.3, hydrostatic pressure, formation pore pressure, overburden stress and vertical \n\neffective stress with the true vertical depth (TVD) are displayed for a typical oil and gas \n\nexploration well. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3 Variations of hydrostatic pressure, formation pore pressure, overburden stress and vertical \n\neffective stress with the true vertical depth (TVD) in a typical oil and gas exploration well. (Source: \n\nZhang, 2011) \n\n \n\nAt relative shallow depths (less than 2000m) pore pressure is hydrostatic, indicating a \n\ncontinuous interconnected column of pore fluid that extends from the surface to a certain depth. \n\nOverpressure starts deeper than 2000m, where pore pressure increases rapidly with depth, \n\nimplying that deeper formations are hydraulically isolated from shallower ones. By 3800m, pore \n\npressure reaches to a value close to the overburden stress, a condition referred to as hard \n\noverpressure. According to the equation (3), the increasing in overpressure causes reduction in \n\nthe effective stress. \n\nPore pressure analyses include three steps:  \n\n? Pre-drill pore pressure prediction; \n\n? Pore pressure prediction while drilling; \n\n? Post-well pore pressure analysis.  \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nThe pre-drill pore pressure can be predicted by using the seismic interval velocity data in the \n\nplanned well location as well as using geological, well logging and drilling data in the offset \n\nwells. The pore pressure prediction while drilling generally uses the logging data while drilling \n\n(LWD), measurement while drilling (MWD), drilling parameters, and mud logging data for \n\nanalyses. Finally, the post-well analysis intends to analyse pore pressures in the drilled wells \n\nusing all available data to build pore pressure model, which can be used for pre-drill pore \n\npressure predictions in the future wells. The well-log-based resistivity method serves to predict \n\npore pressure formation, in order to identify reservoir and fluids pressures. \n\nEaton (Eaton, 1975) proposes an equation to predict pore pressure gradient in shales using \n\nresistivity log. This equation, presented below is more applicable for young sedimentary basins, \n\nand requires that the normal shale resistivity is properly determined. \n\n                   \n \n\n  \n       (4) \n\n \n\nWhere     is the formation pore pressure gradient;     is the overburden stress gradient;     is \n\nthe hydrostatic pore pressure gradient (normally 0.465psi/ft or 1.03MPa/km, dependent on \n\nwater salinity);   is log the shale resistivity;    is the shale resistivity normal compacted trend, \n\n  is the exponent constant ranging from 0.6 to 1.5, and normally  =1.2 (Zhang, 2011). \n\n \n\n2.4 Pore Pressure Estimation in Real Time \n\nThe estimation of pore fluids is a method that helps detect overpressure. It consists of the \n\nobservation of the trend of resistivity (as study parameter) according to depth within low \n\npermeability rock formations such as shale and mudstones. Because resistivity increases with \n\ndepth in the shale zones, we infer that fluids pressure also increase in a linear fashion.  \n\nIn Figure 2.4 below, resistivity versus depth is plotted in shale zones in order to predict fluid \n\npressure. The blue line represents the linear trajectory of resistivity under normal conditions. At \n\na certain depth in shale zones, the trend of resistivity decreases as yellow line shows. That \n\nsometimes happens; can be interpreted this as being overpressure due to a phenomenon related \n\nto undercompaction. The green line represents the top of overpressure.  \n\nThe estimation of pore pressure inferred in the resistivity log data can be performed in real-time \n\nor in the office, but the values of resistivity must be accurate and unaffected by the effects of \n\nanisotropy. Rather than resistivity, the method of pore pressure estimation in real-time can also \n\nbe performed using parameters such as sonic velocity or density logs. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.4 Interpretation of the pore pressure prediction in real time. Overpressure detection from \n\ncompaction profile with LWD. (Source: KSI PPP training). \n\n \n\n2.5 Electrical Anisotropy \n\nElectrical anisotropy consists of the dependence of resistivity on the direction of current flow \n\nwithin a rock. The measure resistivity in the induction logging tool in a vertical wellbore with \n\nhorizontal bedding gives the longitudinal resistivity, which corresponds to current flow parallel \n\nto the bedding. Whether bedding has a significant inclination angle relative to the wellbore or \n\ndip angle of the well is deviated relatively to the bedding it is possible to obtain high resistivity \n\nvalues due to anisotropy. It means that horizontal induction logs crossed more than one \n\nformation or different materials in a certain depth of investigation.  \n\nA rock is isotropic if it has same value of resistivity independent of its direction. If the \n\nmeasurement of resistivity in a given direction is greater than measurement of resistivity in \n\nanother two directions, this rock is termed anisotropic rock. \n\nThere are two types of anisotropy \u2013 microscopic and macroscopic. Microscopic anisotropy is \n\nrelated to the fabric of the rock itself. Microscopic anisotropy can be both mica or clay grains. \n\nSuch anisotropy could originate during primary deposition and compaction, during later \n\ncementation or diagenesis, or by stress from tectonic forces long after deposition (Klein, 1993). \n\nTo the naked eye, rocks with microscopic anisotropy can appear homogenous. Macroscopic \n\nanisotropy consists in homogenous rock layers divided in parallel sequences; each layer \n\ncontains distinct electrical properties. In scale, the layering can vary from fine to coarse grain, \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\nbut the sequence of beds seen in part or whole behave in an anisotropic manner. Current flowing \n\nthat passes through to the bedding perpendicularly have more difficulty due to resistance of the \n\nrock than when current flowing occurs parallel to the bedding. Macroscopic resistivity will \n\naffect measurement of resistivity when the scale of the bedding is less than the resolution of the \n\nmeasurement tool (Klein, 1993). \n\nThe combination of microscopic (from individual beds) and macroscopic (from beds with \n\ndifferent electrical properties) anisotropy results in total anisotropy that exists in a given \n\nbedding. The coefficient of anisotropy and the apparent angle (dip plus deviation) are \n\nresponsible for the effect of the increasing resistivity, which does not correspond to the real \n\nreading of resistivity.  \n\nAnisotropy in a wellbore with high angle relatively to the bedding can have huge impact on the \n\nresistivity. One interpretation of this resistivity log of specific material can lead to erroneous \n\nestimates of hydrocarbon (Klein, 1993). Hence, resistivities from wells in which anisotropy \n\nhave a big impact must be corrected to improve interpretation of the formation and fluids that \n\npercolate in its interstitials. \n\nThe influence of the anisotropy in resistivity (Rv/Rh) of wellbore highly deviated is shown \n\nbelow in Figure 2.5, where several curves of apparent resistivity having different coefficients of \n\nanisotropy vary as the relative inclination increases. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5 Influence of the relative inclination in resistivity measurement when different values of \n\nanisotropy (Rv/Rh) within the formations are considered. (Source: KSI PPP Training) \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\nInitially, all curves have 1ohm of apparent resistivity and until a certain point of relative \n\ninclination start to increase. Each curve of apparent resistivity with the respective coefficient of \n\nanisotropy increases with inclination relative to the bedding. The first curve (in red) has a \n\ncoefficient of two (2), starts to increase clearly after 30\u00ba. The same occurs to the remaining \n\ncurves, but the increasing gradient of the apparent resistivity is greater for higher orders of \n\nanisotropy magnitude. Without any doubt, higher coefficients of anisotropy correspond to \n\nhigher gradients of apparent resistivity increasing. In addition, there is minimum value of \n\ninclination on the graph (around 40\u00ba) that anisotropy starts to have a significant impact on \n\nresistivity. \n\n \n\n2.6 Correction of the Anisotropy  \n\nThe main objective of this study is to propose a methodology to attenuate the effects of the \n\nanisotropy in the resistivity, using the equation proposed by Moran and Gianzero (1979): \n\n   \n   \n\n                 \n      (5) \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n       (6) \n\nWhere: \n\n-    \u2013 True resistivity \n-    \u2013 Vertical resistivity \n-    \u2013 Horizontal resistivity \n-   \u2013 Angle between the tool axis and a vector normal to the bedding \n\nplane (figure 2.6). \n\n \n\nThis equation must be validated for the field or block that resistivity curves will be \n\ncorrected. The criteria of validation consists of correlate the measure resistivity to \n\nthe calculated resistivity. The acquisition of the logs are made by two tools: \n\n- arcVision Array Resistivity that provides just the true resistivity; \n- Rt Scanner Triaxial that provides resistivity of the three principal \n\ndirections; \n\n \n\nThe corrected resistivity is parallel to bedding plane as well as horizontal \n\nresistivity. \n\nIf the calculated horizontal resistivity using the true resistivity from Rt Scanner tool \n\nhas correspondence to the measure horizontal resistivity from the same tool, in all \n\nstudy wells, the validation of equation (5) is done. Therefore, using the true \n\nresistivity from arcVision tool (where we do not have horizontal resistivity) in the \n\nequation (5), the horizontal resistivity can be calculated. \n\nFigure 2.6 shows both arcVision and Rt Scanner tools. The first tool is used in log \n\nacquisitions of development wells, which are highly deviated. The second tool is \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\nmore expensive and is used just in log acquisitions of exploration, which are the \n\nfirst\u2019s wells of each field.       \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.6 Interpretation of the apparent angle. \n\n \n\nBoth vertical and horizontal resistivities derive from the tool RT SCANNER TRIAXIAL \n\nINDUCTION SERVICE, and their ratios give the recorded coefficient of anisotropy with depth \n\n(  . According to Moran and Gianzero (1979), making correction using this equation is \n\nnecessary to assume a laminated sequence of sand-shale, that has an inclination relative to the \n\nwellbore, and consider that material of sand are isotropic and low permeability rocks, such as \n\nshale is anisotropic. \n\nFor a reservoir composed by intercalated layers of sand and shale that are sufficiently thick to be \n\nresolved by Depth Induction Log (ILD), only the microscopic anisotropy of the individuals \n\nlayers are important.  \n\n \n\n2.7 Induction Logs \n\n2.7.1 Gamma ray \n\nNuclear well logging is fundamentally based on natural and induced gamma ray measurements \n\nand the results of neutron or gamma ray interactions with atoms and their components. Gamma \n\nray includes natural gamma radioactivity, gamma ray emission resulting from bombardment and \n\nthe different types of interactions with the elements.  \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\nGamma ray is the most important radiation involved in nuclear logging because they have a \n\nhigh power of penetration and consequently can be recorded even if they have to cross the mud \n\ncolumn or a casing. \n\nGamma ray is used to measure the radioactivity of a rock formation. Natural gamma ray is \n\nrelated to the radioactivity intrinsic to rock formation, whilst induced gamma ray consists of the \n\nemission of energy to the rock formation to get a response of the lithology, which can be high or \n\nlow gamma ray. The responses of the rocks formation are detected in a gamma ray detector \n\ninstalled in the logging tool. \n\nClay minerals have a crystalline structure that can contain more radioactive elements than \n\nsandstones. Therefore, gamma ray data in well logs can be used to separate shale intervals from \n\nother lithologies. The step required to separate shale from other rocks is drawing base lines in \n\ngamma ray data, as shown in figure 2.7. \n\nA simple interpretation of the plot of the gamma ray versus depth is to consider that a \n\nmeasurement of above 75API (counts per second) of gamma ray, indicates a rock formation \n\nwith huge radioactivity material and low permeability, such as mudstone and shale. Below \n\n75API of gamma ray, indicates a lithology with less radioactivity material and high \n\npermeability such as sandstones. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.7 Gamma ray variations with depth. (Source: Zhang, 2011) \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\n2.7.2 Resistivity \n\nResistivity is the inverse of conductivity. The electrical resistivity of a substance is its ability to \n\nblock the flow of electrical current through it. The unit of resistivity is ohm-m and it is a \n\nfundamental inherent property of substance (metal, rock or fluid). \n\nThe measurement of formation resistivity is of particular importance for the evaluation of \n\nhydrocarbon saturation in the non-invaded portion of the reservoir. Combination of the \n\nresistivity data with porosity measurements and formation-water resistivity knowledge allows \n\nthe computation of the water saturation in both shallow and deep zones. Comparison of these \n\ntwo saturation values indicates the amount of the fluid mobility and, consequently, allows the \n\nevaluation of the reservoir productivity. \n\nThere are several of techniques or tools in use for measurement of the formations resistivity, but \n\nall are variations of a common system: \n\n? One emitter (electrode) sends a signal (electrical current) into the formation.  \n\n? One receiver (electrode) measures the response of the formation to this signal at a \n\ncertain distance from the emitter. \n\nGenerally, an increase in the distance between emitter and receiver (called spacing) results in an \n\nimproved depth of investigation (and a reading nearer to   ), at the expense of vertical \n\nresolution.  \n\nResistivity trends are often used in pore pressure determination. This technique relies upon \n\naccurate determination of shale resistivity as an indication of elevated pore pressure. \n\nAccording to Hottmann and Johnson (1965), well-compacted shale rock with less quantity of \n\nwater (less porosity) is more resistive than a less compacted shale rock. They concluded that a \n\nsequence of normally compacted sediments should have a normally increasing shale resistivity \n\ntrend. Then, any shale resistivity decrease from the normal trend indicates the presence of \n\noverpressure.  \n\nThe techniques used to determine the shale points of the rock formation consist of trace a cut off \n\nin the a gamma ray plot and read the correspondent resistivity curve at the same depth (Figure \n\n2.8). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.8 Classification into shale rock.

Enough accurate data from the field exists about the nature, \n\nsize and viability of the reservoir and its contained gas. For this reason, it uses wireline logging \n\nto get more details (parameter) of the area. If an exploration well is well succeeding in terms of \n\nhydrocarbons production, it can be modified for production. An unsuccessful well is \n\ndecommissioned and the area rehabilitated. \n\n\u201cAn exploratory well represents a risk for the company drilling it, because it is not known, \n\nbefore investing in the well, how much oil or natural gas it might contain. The well may turn out \n\nto be a profitable new source of fossil fuel, or it may contain noncommercial quantities of fuel \n\nthat aren't worth extracting; in the latter case, the well may be plugged and abandoned.\u201d \n\n(Source: www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exploratory-well.asp). \n\nIn summary, an exploration well is drilled to:  \n\na) Find oil or gas in an area previously considered unproductive;  \n\nb) Find a new reservoir in a known field, i.e., one previously producing oil and gas from \n\nanother reservoir; \n\nc) Extend the limit of a known oil or gas reservoir  \n\n \n\n2.8.2 Development Wells \n\nDevelopment wells are wells drilled within the proved area of an oil or gas reservoir to the \n\ndepth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive, to maximize the chances of success.  In \n\norder arrive to the reservoir horizontally, development wells generally are highly deviated.  \n\nDevelopment wells do not need much log data, hence log data acquisitions are made by \n\nlogging-while-drilling (LWD) mainly true resistivity and gamma ray exist. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n\n2.9 Description of the Logging Tools \n\nThis study uses two techniques to produce the acquisition of logging data: (1) Logging While \n\nDrilling (LWD); and (2) Wireline logging (LW).  \n\nLogging While Drilling is the technique of transmitting well logging tools into a well borehole \n\ndownhole as part of the bottom hole assembly (BHA). Wireline logging is an expensive \n\ntechnique that consists of continuously collecting and recording data from a borehole during the \n\ndrilling process.  \n\nThe LWD \u2013 arcVISION is a compensated array resistivity tool developed by Schlumberger for \n\nmedium to large boreholes (Figure 2.9). The 6.75 inch (17 cm) diameter tool makes multiple, \n\nborehole-compensated phase shift and attenuation resistivity measurements at two frequencies: \n\n2MHz and 400 kHz; With arcVision, which usually uses 2MHz. At 2 MHz, phase-shift and \n\nattenuation can be measured between two antennas with negligible induction. Borehole \n\ncompensation cancels the differences between the two receivers. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.9 arcVISION tool and devices: wear band, transmitters and receivers. (Source: Schlumberger) \n\n \n\nThe tool\u2019s antenna array consists of five transmitters and two receivers to achieve both a range \n\nof depths of investigations as well as borehole compensation. This tool provides gamma ray, \n\nresistivity, inclination and annular pressure\u2013while\u2013drilling measurements (APWD) that help to \n\nproduce and evaluate reservoirs. \n\nTo differentiate between borehole effects, anisotropy, invasion and shoulder beds are useful for  \n\nmultiple depths of investigation (DOI). Borehole compensation is important because it \n\nsignificantly reduces the effects of borehole rugosity. \n\nThe arcVISION tool can operate in memory mode or in real-time mode in combination with the \n\nTeleScope MWD tool; it can also be combined with any other LWD tool. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\nThree factors have a considerable influence in depth of investigation (DOI): \n\n? Distance from transmitter (T) to receiver (R) (as greater is the distance T/R, the deeper \n\nis the DOI); \n\n? Signal frequency (the lower the frequency the deeper the DOI); \n\n? Type of measurement (phase shift reads are more shallow than attenuation). \n\n \n\nMode of operation (see Figure 2.10 and Figure 2.11): \n\n? The current from the top transmitter induces an electromagnetic field within the \n\nformation; \n\n? This propagates away from the transmitter; \n\n? The wave induces a current at the receivers; \n\n? The phase and amplitude of the wave are measured and converted to resistivity. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.10 Model of operation of the logging tool.(Source: Schlumberger) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTransmitter \n\n \n\nReceiver \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.11 arcVISION resistivity environmental effects: from drilling and from formation.(Source: \n\nSchlumberger) \n\n \n\nThe RT Scanner triaxial induction device (figure 2.12) calculates both vertical and horizontal \n\nresistivity (   and   ) from direct measurements while simultaneously solving for formation \n\ndip at any well deviation (1D inversion);    runs parallel to the bedding plane and    is \n\northogonal to the   .

CASE STUDY \n\nThis study investigates a block and five exploration wells whose names have been changed in \n\norder to keep certain privileged information confidential. This section describes the \n\ngeographical and geological characteristics of the Block Michocho and the wells available. \n\n \n\n3.1 Geographical and Geological Settings of Block Michocho \n\n3.1.1 Geographical Settings  \n\nBlock Michocho is an exploration and production block located in the West of the Luanda \n\nprovince, in the region of the capital of Angola. The main operator of these fields is the \n\nCompany Total EP Angola. A set of wells closer to the operated fields were chosen to \n\ncharacterize anisotropy in the Block Michoho. Figure 3.1 shows location of the five exploration \n\nas well as a set of development wells named \u201cDona\u201d.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 Location of Block Michocho in the offshore of Angola and location of the Joia, Obika, Moyo, \n\nSamalesso, Lango and Dona wells under study. (source: TEPA) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\n3.1.2 Geological Settings \n\nThe Block Michocho is located at the SouthWestern edge of the huge Lower Congo Basin, \n\nmainly of Tertiary Period. The structural evolution is attributed to a westward regional thin-\n\nskinned extension that has been affecting the Upper Cretaceous to current sedimentary cover \n\nsince the Albian. \n\nThe Aptian \u201cLoeme\u201d salt layer corresponds to the basal detachment level which permitted the \n\nwestward gravity gliding of the sedimentary cover above a pre-Aptian passive deposits. \n\nFrom east to west, the Block Michocho\u2019s passive margin is divided into four main tectonic \n\ndomains with contrasted deformation styles (Figure 3.2): (1) stable, (2) proximal extensional (3) \n\ntransitional and (4) Compressional. \n\nThe Middle Miocene \u2013 Upper Miocene (M-UM) area is located in the proximal-extensional \n\ndomain marked by numerous listric and normal faults separating some tectonic rafts of \n\nCretaceous, Eocene and Oligocene series separated by huge compensation graben (as the NW-\n\nSE oriented Oligocene E Graben) which are unfilled by Miocene to actual series. \n\nDuring the Pliocene Period, the area was characterized by a significant increase in tectonic \n\nsliding activity that created a typical turtleback anticline westward and a thick Plio-Pleistocene \n\ndepot-centre above the M-UM area and eastward (graben). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 Location of block Michocho (Source: TEPA). \n\n \n\nAccording to the combination of numerous faults and sand levels overall, the sedimentary series \n\n(Lower Miocene, Middle Miocene, Upper Miocene) M and UM present the same source rocks, \n\npathway and timing migration.  \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\nAccording to a technical report of TEPA, the Middle Miocene interval is constituted of channel-\n\nlevee turbidity complexes and initial lobe deposits. Lower Miocene interval is constituted by \n\nsand lobes and slightly erosive sandy channels, which are more or less canalized by graben axis. \n\nThe lithology of the Block Michocho is composed predominantly of sand, shale, laminations of \n\nsand-shale and turbidity\u2019s sequences from the Oligocene series. (see Figure 3.3). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 Lithostratigraphic column of the Lower Congo Basin (source: Brownfield and Charpentier, \n\n2006). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\n3.2 Exploration Wells of Block Michocho \n\nThe following table describes the operational features of the five exploration wells (Joia, Obika, \n\nMoyo, Samalesso and Lango) in this study.

If the matches verify in the \n\nfive wells, we can conclude that Equation (5) serves to make correction of the anisotropy in \n\nresistivity. It is very important to know the coefficient of anisotropy that we have to use in that \n\nformula. \n\n \n\n3.4 Validation of the Formula and Results Well by Well \n\nThe same procedure was applied for the five exploration wells as mentioned. The results are \n\npresent in a sequence of graphics subdivided by well and stratigraphy to better understand the \n\nbehaviour of the formation anisotropy in the resistivity. \n\nFirst, to restrict the shale points, a gamma ray versus depth graph was plotted. A threshold of \n\n75API was used to separate shale. It is important to take into account that neither all gamma ray \n\nabove 75API is shale, as it is possible to find micro-carbonaceous specks, organic matter and \n\nother materials with high radioactive. Second, boxes of intervals of shale from the plot of \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\ngamma ray versus depth were selected and correlated with resistivity and anisotropy in the same \n\ndepth to produce an expedited interpretation. \n\n \n\n3.4.1 Joia Well \n\nFigure 3.7 displays the plot of gamma ray, inclination, resistivity log and anisotropy by depth \n\nfor Joia; stratigraphic units are showed at the left part of the graphic. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.7 Joia well: plot of gamma ray, inclination, resistivity log and anisotropy with depth separated by \n\nstratigraphy. \n\n \n\nConcerning Joia well: \n\n? The depth is more in Upper Miocene and the material is turbidity. \n\n? Shale points (were gamma ray are above 75API, black line) are delimited by green \n\nboxes to better visualize the correspondent values in resistivity and anisotropy.  \n\n? The inclination of Joia well increases until 24\u00ba and stabilize. Therefore, the impact of \n\ndeviation on the anisotropy with depth is insignificant. \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n\n? Within the depth range between 1480m and 1590m (first box) resistivity is around \n\n0.85?m representing a massive claystone interval (TEPA technical report). \n\n? Between depths 1650m and 1700m, gamma ray decreases abruptly and becomes \n\nalmost proportional to the increase of resistivity. This interval is predominantly \n\nsandstone; by correlation with the plot of resistivity in that zone, an expedited \n\ninterpretation reveals that it corresponds to on oil reservoir. A similar situation occurs \n\nat depths between 1900m and 2000m. \n\n? The righter plot of the Figure indicates an increase of anisotropy with depth. The \n\nFigure 3.8 shows that increase with more detail. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.8 Joia well: plots of gamma ray and recorded coefficient of anisotropy with depth. Red lines \n\nrepresent trends of anisotropy within the shale intervals. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\n? From the correlation between the plot of gamma ray (green boxes) and anisotropy in \n\ndepth, it is observed an increase of anisotropy in the low permeable rock formation \n\n(shale) (red lines). Fortunately, that evolution of anisotropy will not cause major \n\nchanges in the resistivity. \n\n? The peak of gamma ray at around 1670m corresponds to the sequence of sand-shale, \n\nand a high peak of anisotropy in that depth was observed. That abrupt transition of \n\nlithology creates locally high anisotropy. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.9 demonstrates the result of Equation (5) modified to Equation (6) using the recorded \n\ncoefficient of anisotropy for each point of depth and the error between the matches of the \n\nhorizontal resistivity from the tool and computed horizontal resistivity.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.9 Joia well. Application and validation of Equation 5 using recorded coefficient of anisotropy. \n\nLeft track: gamma ray; middle track: computed horizontal resistivity (blue line) matching with horizontal \n\nresistivity (red line) from the tool; right track: error associated with the matching between computed Rh \n\nand measured Rh. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\nThe plot on the right shows the error, or the difference between the computed resistivity and the \n\nlogging tool resistivity. Within the green boxes (shale points) errors are below 10%, which can \n\nbe acceptable for the validation of the Equation (5). \n\nThe plot of anisotropy versus depth (see Figure 3.7 and 3.8) demonstrates a range of anisotropy \n\nbetween 2 and 6. Besides the use of recorded values for coefficient of anisotropy in the equation \n\n5, in a second test and for sensitivity purposes three constant values for coefficient of anisotropy \n\nwere used in the equation 5 in order to check if the results are similar. In figure 3.10, results are \n\nof coefficient of anisotropy equals to 3. The others plots with coefficient of anisotropy 2 and 6 \n\nare in the annex. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.10 Joia well. Validation of the equation 5 using constant coefficient of anisotropy equals to 3 and \n\ncomputed error. \n\n \n\nThe results show that there is no substantial difference between the plots with recorded or \n\nconstant coefficient of anisotropy of Equation 5 and the error associated is almost the same in \n\nthe shale points. Similar results are obtained for the remaining coefficient of anisotropy values 2 \n\nand 6 (see annex). \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\nIn order to understand the evolution of anisotropy and its relationship with gamma ray in depth, \n\nFigure 3.11 displays a scattergram of those two variables in three intervals of shale.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.11 Joia well. Scattergram between anisotropy (x-axis) and gamma ray (y-axis) within shale \n\nintervals. \n\n \n\nDespite a strong dispersion of values, Figure 3.11 enables to observe that the anisotropy \n\nincrease with GR and both increases in depth, due to compaction of material, where sediments \n\nare undergoing to reorganization and they create laminations of different materials.  \n\n \n\n3.4.2 Obika well \n\nFigure 3.12 displays a plot of gamma ray, inclination, resistivity log and anisotropy by depth; \n\nstratigraphic units are showed at the left part of the graphic. \n\nConcerning Obika well: \n\n? Obika well stratigraphy sits in Upper Miocene with predominance of sand and shale. \n\n? A gamma ray cut-off of 75API (black line) to get shale points was also applied, which \n\nare identified by grey boxes. \n\n? Obika well is vertical; therefore, anisotropy will not have impact in the resistivity.  \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\n \nFigure 3.12 Obika well: plot of gamma ray, inclination, resistivity log and anisotropy with depth \n\nseparated by stratigraphy. \n\n \n\n? At the interval between 1480m and 1800m, (selected box) a massive claystone is \n\nidentified (TEPA technical report).  \n\n? Between depth 1800 and 1900m gamma ray decreases abruptly, and becomes almost \n\nproportional to the increase of resistivity. This interval contains predominantly \n\nsandstone; the behaviour of resistivity in that zone suggests a correspondence to an oil \n\nreservoir.  \n\n? After the oil reservoir, at a depth between 1900m and 2500m a massive claystone \n\noccur again. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.13 shows the application and validation of the equation (5) using recorded coefficient \n\nof anisotropy for each point of depth and the error (differences) between the values of the \n\nhorizontal resistivity from the logging tool and the computed horizontal resistivity. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.13 Obika well. Application and validation of equation 5 using recorded coefficient of anisotropy. \n\nLeft track: gamma ray; middle track: computed horizontal resistivity (blue line) matching with horizontal \n\nresistivity (red line) from the tool; right track: error associated to the matching between computed Rh and \n\nmeasured Rh. \n\n \n\nThe center plot shows Computed Horizontal Resistivity (blue line) matching with Horizontal \n\nResistivity (red line) from the tool. From the selected box, the error matching between the \n\ncomputed horizontal resistivity and the horizontal resistivity from the logging tool is quite \n\nalways below 10%.  \n\nAgain, in the figure 3.14, the computed horizontal resistivity uses a coefficient of anisotropy of \n\n3. In annex plots with coefficient of anisotropy of 2 and 6 are presented. Both plots using record \n\nor constant coefficient of anisotropy on equation (5) get the same results and the error \n\nassociated are almost the same in the shale points. The plot of validation of the equation (5) \n\nusing coefficient of anisotropy 2 and 6 present the same results (see annex).  \n\nFinally, figure 3.15 displays a scattergram of anisotropy and gamma ray in the intervals of \n\nshale. \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.14 Obika well.

Scattergram between anisotropy (x-axis) and gamma ray (y-axis) within shale \n\nintervals. \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\nObika well is vertical and it is a shallow well hence, anisotropy has a lower range interval when \n\ncompared for instance with Joia well. The scattergram between anisotropy and gamma ray in \n\nthese three intervals of shale points does not give good answers about the behaviour of both \n\nparameters in depth. There is a small increase in anisotropy but it is not expressive to support \n\nthe idea that anisotropy increase with depth due to compaction. \n\n \n\n3.4.3 Moyo Well \n\nFigure 3.16 displays a plot of gamma ray, inclination, resistivity log and anisotropy by depth; \n\nstratigraphic units are showed at the left part of the graphic. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.16 Moyo well.

Moyo well sits in Lower Miocene shale, sand and laminations of sand-shale occurs. \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\n? A gamma ray cut-off of 75API (black line) was made to get shale data, which are \n\nidentified by green boxes. \n\n? Moyo well is vertical; therefore, anisotropy will not have an impact on resistivity. \n\n? From depth 1600m to 1700m, (selected box) resistivity represents claystone (TEPA \n\ntechnical report).  \n\n? At depth 1730m there is an interval in which gamma ray decreases, indicating the \n\npresence of sand sediment and resistivity increases indicating the presence of an oil \n\nreservoir. \n\n? Gamma ray presents many peaks below 75 API. Those peaks represent sequences of \n\nsand-shale. \n\n? At depth of 2100m gamma ray is very low which indicates a sand interval. The same \n\ndepth presents decreasing resistivity, which indicates the presence of a water reservoir. \n\n? Moyo well is vertical; but the behaviour of anisotropy is unlike Obika well. That \n\nhappens because of the sand-shale sequence. The transitions of lithology are \n\nmacroscopically anisotropic. \n\nOnce again, Figure 3.17 demonstrates the application and validation of Equation (5) using the \n\nrecorded coefficient of anisotropy for each point of depth and the error (differences) between \n\nthe values of the horizontal resistivity from the logging tool and the computed horizontal \n\nresistivity. \n\nThe plot in the center shows a good match between both true and computed horizontal \n\nresistivity (respectively the red and the blue lines). From the green box, the error or differences \n\nin resistivity are below 10% in shale zones.  \n\nFigure 3.18 shows the computed horizontal resistivity with the constant 3 as coefficient of \n\nanisotropy. The plots with coefficient of anisotropy 2 and 6 are included as attachments to this \n\npaper. \n\nThere is no substantial difference between the plots using record or constant coefficients of \n\nanisotropy on Equation (5); the error associated is almost the same in the shale points. The plot \n\nof validation of Equation 5 using coefficient of anisotropy 2 and 6 present the same results (see \n\nannex). \n\nFinally, figure 3.19 displays a scattergram of anisotropy and gamma ray in the intervals of \n\nshale. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.17 Moyo well.

The crossplot \n\nbetween anisotropy and gamma ray does not provides a good reading concerning to the \n\nbehaviour of anisotropy with depth in shale intervals. \n\n \n\n3.4.4 Samalesso well \n\nFigure 3.20 displays a plot of gamma ray, inclination, resistivity log and anisotropy by depth; \n\nstratigraphic units are showed at the left part of the graphic. \n\nConcerning Samalesso well: \n\n? The Samalesso well sits in Miocene and Oligocene formations, and consists of \n\npredominantly shale, sand and trace micro carbonaceous specks, that is occasionally \n\nsub-laminated with organic matter, slightly to very dolomitic. \n\n? Gamma ray presents high values in both Miocene and Oligocene formations. This \n\nprobably occurs because of the presence of organic matter. \n\n? We define a gamma ray cut-off of 80API (black line) to select shale points. The \n\ngamma ray box includes shale intervals to verify what happens in the evolution of the \n\nplots of resistivity versus depth. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.20 Samalesso well. Plot of gamma ray, inclination, resistivity log and anisotropy with depth \n\nseparated by stratigraphical units. \n\n \n\n? According to the plot of gamma ray versus depth, intervals from depths of 2800m to \n\n2840m, from 3120m to 3140m and 3270m to 3380m indicate a large amount of sand. \n\nThe correlation of these intervals with the plot of resistivity indicates an oil reservoir.  \n\n? The Samalesso well has an inclination of 50\u00ba; therefore, anisotropy will have a impact \n\non the resistivity. \n\n? Anisotropy presents many high peaks in both formations because of the variation of \n\nthe lithology along the depth. \n\n? The plot of anisotropy versus depth reveals many high peaks in the zones of a change \n\nof sediments, for instance, a sequence of sand-shale. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.21 plots the application and validation of Equation (5) using a recorded coefficient of \n\nanisotropy for each point of depth and the error between the matches of the measure horizontal \n\nresistivity and computed horizontal resistivity. \n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.21 Samalesso well.

The Lango well sits in a Miocene formation, and consists of predominantly shale, sand \n\nand many sequences of sand-shale. \n\n? Gamma ray presents many peaks of low values that represent sequences of sand-shale. \n\nThe correlation of these peaks in the plot of resistivity corresponds to the presence of \n\noil reservoirs. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n46 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.24 Lango well. Plot of gamma ray, inclination, resistivity log and anisotropy all with depth \n\nseparated by stratigraphy. \n\n \n\n? A gamma ray cut-off of 80API (black line) was defined to select shale points. From \n\ngamma ray the boxes shows shale intervals to verify what happens in the evolution of \n\nthe plots of resistivity versus depth. \n\n? The depths below 1800m low values of gamma ray are observed, which corresponds \n\nto sandstone. When correlating it in the plot of resistivity, that zone shows the \n\npresence of a water reservoir. We can find the same scenario in depth of 2600m.  \n\n? The depth below 2200m presents a similar situation in gamma ray but the resistivity \n\nshows the opposite behaviour corresponding to the presence of an oil reservoir. \n\n? Anisotropy reveals some high peaks in the zones of change of sediments for example, \n\nsequences of sand-shale. The depth 2200m is the best example of the presence of a \n\nsequence of sand-shale.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n\nFigure 3.25 plots the application and validation of Equation 5 using recorded coefficient of \n\nanisotropy for each point of depth and the error between the matches of the measure horizontal \n\nresistivity and computed horizontal resistivity. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.25 Lango well.

Along the depth, sediments are \n\ncompacted and they reorganized themselves, creating laminations of material with different \n\nproperties. Because of that, the logging tool reads vertical resistivity greater than the horizontal \n\nresistivity when cross over different layers along the depth. As the anisotropy is the ratio \n\nbetween vertical and horizontal resistivity, the greater the depth the greater anisotropy will be. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n51 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.29 Explanation of the increase of anisotropy in depth.

A simple \n\nexplanation for this is that Oligocene is a deeper formation than Miocene.

APPLICATION OF THE CORRECTION ON A DEVELOPMENT WELL \n\n4.1 Dona 761 Well \n\nThe Dona 761 is one of a set development wells that sit between Middle Miocene and Lower \n\nMiocene series. Dona 761 has a maximum deviation of 80\u00ba and the measure resistivity is \n\nunrealistic due to the anisotropy effect. Hence, it is important to correct the resistivity acquired \n\nat Dona 761 well, in order to make a better interpretation in the pore pressure prediction. Figure \n\n4.1 shows the correction of the observed resistivity using different constants coefficients of \n\nanisotropy of 2, 3 and 6. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 Dona development well. Plot on the left shows correction of the observed resistivity (red line) \n\nusing minimum, mean and maximum coefficient of anisotropy. Plot on the right shows the inclination of \n\nDalia well with depth. \n\n \n\nThe application of Equation (5) to correction of resistivity of this development well presents \n\ndifferent curves for different coefficients of anisotropy. From that plot, it is difficult to know \n\nwhich curve is the proper curve to use in the pore pressure prediction. Therefore, Equation (5) \n\ncannot be used with a constant coefficient of anisotropy. The solution found for the calibration \n\nof the coefficient of anisotropy based in the normal compaction trend of shale resistivity.  \n\n\n\n \n\n54 \n\n \n\n4.2 Calibration of the Coefficient of Anisotropy \n\nAccording Eaton, the normal resistivity (Rn) is a function of the burial depth. Therefore, it is \n\npossible to calibrate the coefficient of anisotropy using the normal compaction condition of both \n\nvertical and horizontal resistivity. \n\n      \n     (7) \n\n \n\nWhere    is the shale resistivity with normal compaction condition;    is the shale resistivity in \n\nthe mudline;   is the constant; and   is the depth below the mudline. \n\nWe calculate the constant b through the global trend of both vertical and horizontal resistivity of \n\nthe five exploration wells applying a value of z (z=5000m) greater than all the wells of Block \n\nMichocho. Once we have the constant b, we calculate both vertical and horizontal normal shale \n\nresistivity for the five exploration wells. \n\nFrom the ratio between vertical and horizontal resistivity (Equation 8), it is possible to get the \n\ncoefficient of anisotropy in the normal compaction condition. \n\n \n\n           \n     ;              \n\n     ;     \n  \n\n  \n  (8) \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2 shows the application of Equation (8) to obtain a global trend of both horizontal and \n\nvertical normal shale resistivity and the global trend of anisotropy in depth. \n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2 Horizontal and vertical resistivity of the wells. The lines showing the trend of resistivity \n\nresulted from equation 2. The line in the global resulted from the ratio between vertical and horizontal \n\nresistivity. Righ plot shows the calculated trend for anisotropy. \n\n \n\n4.3 Impact of the Anisotropy in Resistivity \n\nThe presence of an anisotropic formation in deviated wells or in wells in which bedding is \n\ninclined relative to the wellbore can result in significant deviations in induction log response.  \n\nThree exploration wells with different relative dip to the bedding were chosen to evaluate the \n\nimpact of the anisotropy on their apparent resistivity (see Figure 4.3).  \n\nWe get the impact of the anisotropy by comparing the corrected resistivity curve (blue line) \n\nregarding to the measure true resistivity (red line) of the three exploration wells as the slope of \n\nthe wells increases.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n56 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.3 Log plots of observed resistivity and corrected resistivity for three wells with different \n\ndeviation. The corrected resistivities in the more highly deviated wells are generally consistent with the \n\nresistivities recorded in the nearly vertical well, which is nearly perpendicular to the bedding. \n\n \n\nAccording to Figure 4.3, the first track is a vertical well, in which both observed and corrected \n\nresistivity have the same result. This means that, in the vertical wells it is not necessary correct \n\nthe anisotropy. \n\nThe second track of the Joia well presents a well with 24\u00ba inclination. In that well, anisotropy \n\nhas an insignificant impact and is observed recorded corrected resistivity that differ from \n\nrecorded observed resistivity at a certain depth. \n\nThe third track is Samalesso well, which has a 50\u00ba inclination, and corrected resistivity lower \n\nthan the observed resistivity. That formation is very deep and anisotropic; therefore, we have \n\nvalues of the deep induction log that are significantly larger in deviated wells than in vertical \n\nwells. \n\nThat corrected resistivity is correct measurement to use to estimate of pore pressure. Figure 4.4 \n\nbelow demonstrates the impact of the anisotropy in a set of curves of resistivity of development \n\nwells. All these wells have high inclination and give unrealistic resistivity values. Even in the \n\nFigure 4.4, on the right track are the respective corrections of these curves, which are more \n\n\n\n \n\n57 \n\ncoherent, with resistivity values closer to the resistivity values of vertical wells, which are \n\nresistivity\u2019s parallel to the bedding plane. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.4 Development wells. On the left track: observed resistivities; on the middle track: inclination of \n\nthe wells; on the right track: corrected resistivity of the development wells. \n\n \n\nThe high inclination of the development wells changes completely the observed resistivity due \n\nto the anisotropy environment. Equation (5) corrects the global trend of the resistivity to the \n\nvertical direction. The present corrected resistivity is appropriate for  use in pore pressure \n\nprediction. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n58 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n59 \n\n5. AN EXAMPLE OF PORE PRESSURE PREDICTION \n\n5.1 Lango Well \n\nLango is a vertical well hence, it is not necessary to correct its resistivity. Lango resistivity is \n\nready to be used in the pore pressure prediction. \n\nThe log resistivity of Figure 5.1 is only from shale points, and fluids in these formations are \n\nunder much pressure. Pore pressure prediction was performed using the Equation (4) given by \n\nEaton (1975). That requires calculating the pressure in a rock formation with low permeability \n\nsuch as shale.  \n\n                   \n \n\n  \n   (4) \n\n \n\nWhere     is the formation pore pressure gradient;     is the overburden stress gradient;     is \n\nthe hydrostatic pore pressure gradient (normally 0.465psi/ft or 1.03MPa/km, dependent on \n\nwater salinity);   is log the shale resistivity;    is the shale resistivity normal compacted trend, \n\n  is the exponent constant ranging from 0.6 to 1.5, and normally  =1.2 (Zhang, 2011). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1 Sidetrack of Lango well. (left): gamma ray with cut-off 75API; (middle) resistivity; (right) \n\npore pressure prediction. \n\n\n\n \n\n60 \n\n \n\nFrom gamma ray and resistivity, shale points were filtered. Therefore, the pressure inferred in \n\nthe resistivity of the Lango well is all from low permeability formation. At lower depths the \n\npressure is normal but at a certain depth the pressure increases more than the normal pressure. \n\nThe selected area on the resistivity plot shows oil reservoir and water reservoir under much \n\npressured. An overpressure can be identified in the right track of Figure 5.1. The track on the \n\nright demonstrates pore pressure in the shale. From the normal pressure of the water and the \n\n(respectively, 1.525psi/m and 3.28psi/m), we calculate the pressure until depth 3300m. \n\nHydrostatic pressure is under redline. The phenomenon of overpressure is between the \n\nhydrostatic pressure and the overburden gradient. Overpressure is what we want to avoid in \n\ndrilling activity. Hence, we have to report the above situation to the department of the company \n\nthat will design future wells in the Block Michocho. \n\n \n\n5.2 Benefits and Disadvantages of the Correction of Resistivity \n\nThe correction of anisotropy in resistivity from wells with high relative dips serves to obtain the \n\nresistivity parallel to a bedding plan; that resistivity is appropriate in pore pressure prediction. \n\nAlthough the details of the logs are different, corrected resistivity recorded are more consistent \n\nthan observed resistivity. Anisotropy correction gives results more closely resemble to logs \n\nfrom vertical wells. \n\nApplication of Equation (5) requires horizontal resistivity logs, which are logs obtained with \n\nwireline induction tools that are very expensive. Before using Equation (5) to correct resistivity, \n\nthe Equation must be validated for the field that we want to investigate. That requires to have \n\navailable all log data of the parameter involved in the Equation. \n\nFor this study, the calibration of the coefficient of anisotropy did not utilize a unique coefficient. \n\nWe have to use a mean of the normal resistivity shale of the field. \n\nThe correction of anisotropy reduces resistivity logs used to estimate reserves. \n\nCorrected resistivity curves from Equation (5), when validated are appropriate for pore pressure \n\nprediction. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n61 \n\n6. FINAL REMARKS \n\n6.1 Conclusion \n\nWhenever anisotropy is present in a formation and a wellbore performed in that is not \n\nperpendicular to the bedding, having high relative dip angle, the measured induction log \n\nresistivities will be too large. The higher the coefficient of anisotropy, the higher the increase of \n\napparent resistivity. \n\nIn addition, there is a minimum angle of the relative well inclination required to see a significant \n\nimpact of the anisotropy on the apparent resistivity.  \n\nThe resistivity of anisotropic rock formations relies on the horizontal resistivity of the specific \n\nrock formation (resistivity measured by an induction tool normal to the bedding), the coefficient \n\nof anisotropy, and the angle between the wellbore and a vector normal to the bedding plane.  \n\nShales or thinly laminated sand-shale sequences are the cause of anisotropy. In the shale \n\nmaterials in all five exploration wells, anisotropy increases with burial due to compaction, \n\nwhich reorganizes the sediments. \n\nBlock Michocho presents an Oligocene formation more anisotropic than Miocene. The increase \n\nof anisotropy with compaction is the more likely explanation for this situation. \n\nThe formula of correction of the anisotropy in resistivity was validated, with 10% as global \n\nerror associated, which can be seen as acceptable when working with resistivity logs.  \n\nThis formula computes horizontal resistivity, the closest property measured by wireline \n\ninduction logs, for the five exploration wells.  \n\nIn the Block Michocho, the coefficient of anisotropy reached a global range between two and \n\nsix along the depth. This required us to use the Equation (5) with different constants of \n\ncoefficient of anisotropy in resistivity curves of the development well highly deviated. But we \n\nrealized during this study that making a correction with Equation (5) using a constant \n\ncoefficient of anisotropy gives us different curves i.e for this block, there is no appropriate \n\nconstant coefficient of anisotropy that would produce a better correction.  \n\nIt is important to calibrate the coefficient of anisotropy correctly, in order to predict/estimate the \n\nright shale pressure; therefore, we used the normal compaction condition (applying Eaton\u2019s \n\nequation) of both vertical and horizontal shale resistivities to produce the global trend of \n\ncoefficient of anisotropy for Block Michocho. \n\nFrom the set of curves of development wells, we see the correction of anisotropy putting \n\nvertical trend to the curves, and also see that the values of corrected resistivity are more \n\n\n\n \n\n62 \n\ncoherent and relatively close to the values resistivities of vertical wells, which is nearly normal \n\nto the bedding. \n\nThe application of the method of pore pressure prediction in shale resistivity was performed \n\nsuccessfully, which allowed us to verify that the behaviour of resistivity log with depth permits \n\nus to infer the pressures of the fluid within formations. From the resistivity curve, we infer the \n\npressure on the well under study and could find an overpressure situation starting at depth \n\n1050m. We could check the overpressure using Eaton\u2019s Equation (4) of pore pressure in shale. \n\n \n\n6.2 Recommendations on the use of the Method Developed \n\nTo use the correction of anisotropy in pore pressure prediction is important to filter resistivity to \n\nselect the shale points (regions). \n\nIn the other blocks or fields, equation (5) must be validated before using to correct resistivity \n\nlogs. A better way to make validation of equation (5) is to compare horizontal resistivity from \n\ninduction log tool with computed horizontal resistivity for the wells where this information is \n\navailable. \n\nIt is not necessary to apply the correction of anisotropy in resistivity of wells that intersect \n\nperpendicular to the bedding because the induction logs tool gives the true resistivity, which is \n\nequal to horizontal resistivity. \n\nTo correct more accurately the curves of resistivity it is better to calibrate the coefficient of \n\nanisotropy using the normal compaction condition. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n63 \n\n \n\n7.
