PHAs emerge as a possible solution as substitutes of petroleum \nbased plastics, being produced under the Biorefinery concept, in which wastes \nand by-products of numerous industries may be used as carbon source.  \nThis project aimed the isolation and characterization of organisms able to store \nPHAs from Hardwood Sulphite Spent Liquor (HSSL), a by-product of the pulp \nand paper industry. Isolation was performed from a Mixed Microbial Culture \n(MMC) selected under feast and famine conditions, using some components \npresent in HSSL as substrates, such as acetic acid and xylose. Five pure \nisolates able to produce PHAs resulted from the successive streaking in solid \nmedium containing HSSL. The purity of the isolates was evaluated through \nGram staining and FISH analysis and the PHAs accumulation by Nile Blue \nstaining. Two strains were identified as Rhohococcus spp. and three as \nPseudomonas spp.. One isolate of each genus was selected and further \nstudied in terms of growth and PHAs accumulation capability from three distinct \ncarbon sources (HSSL, acetic acid and xylose). Both isolates, Rhodococcus \nspp. and Pseudomonas spp., were able to grow and use the three carbon \nsources as well as to produce PHAs. However, both strains showed a higher \nmaximum specific growth rate (\u00b5max) when HSSL was used as carbon source, \n0.212 \u00b1 0.0219 h\n\n-1\n and 0.251 \u00b1 0.0526 h\n\n-1\n, respectively. A qualitative evaluation \n\nof the PHAs accumulation through Nile Blue staining exhibited a higher \naccumulation when acetic acid was used as sole carbon source. \nIn an attempt to identify some of the species responsible for PHAs \naccumulation of the selected MMC, belonging to the dominant class, \nAlphaproteobacteria, a 16S rDNA clone library was constructed. It was possible \nto identity Novosphingobium spp., Sphingobium spp. and Pleomorphomonas \nspp. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\nContents \n\n \n\n1.

Introduction \n\n \n\nMankind has been relying on chemicals, polymers and fuels produced from fossil \n\nresources (petroleum, natural gas, and coal) ever since industrialization (Kamm et al. 2006; \n\nGao et al. 2011; Pei et al. 2011). However, fossil fuels are not considered sustainable. A \n\nsignificant number of environmental and economic concerns arose from the massive scale \n\nprocessing of the current fossil resources by chemical industry. In addition to this, the \n\ndepletion of fossil resources is expected in the near future (Kamm et al. 2006; Octave et al. \n\n2009). Thus, it is essential to establish solutions to promote a sustainable development in \n\nthe 21\nst\n century. One of the current approaches is the progressive transition to an economy \n\nbased on renewable materials (e.g. biomass) as feedstock for the production of bio-\n\nproducts within the biorefinery concept (Kamm et al. 2006; Octave et al. 2009). The \n\nAmerican National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) defined biorefinery as \u201ca \n\nfacility that integrates biomass conversion processes and equipment to produce fuels, \n\npower and chemicals from biomass\u201d and that \u201cthe biorefinery concept is analogous to \n\ntoday\u2019s petroleum refineries, which produce multiple fuels and products from petroleum\u201d \n\n(Kamm et al. 2006; NREL 2012). Biorefineries would provide energy (biofuel, heat), \n\nmolecules (fine chemistry, cosmetics, paramedical), materials (plastics, composites) as \n\nwell as food ingredients (Octave et al. 2009). \n\nPlastics have gained importance as a way to enhance life quality and comfort and \n\nare present in our everyday life in all sorts of forms, from disposable utensils to packaging \n\n(Khanna et al. 2005; Castilho et al. 2009). Their use is related to their properties such as \n\nstrength, lightness, durability and resistance to degradation. However, some of these \n\nqualities are now their major problem (Khanna et al. 2005) since make their disposal \n\ndifficult (Castilho et al. 2009). Accumulation of microscopic plastic debris at sea is \n\nparticularly alarming as well as the exponentially increasing need of landfill for municipal \n\nsolid waste disposal (Gomez et al. 2012). \n\nPolyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are polymers produced biologically, with similar \n\nproperties to synthetic plastics. PHAs are biodegradable, biocompatible and may be \n\nproduced from renewable sources, thus offering a solution to the environmental hazards \n\ndisplayed by conventional plastics (Khanna et al. 2005; Gumel et al. 2012). \n\n  \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n2 \n \n\nThis project aim to study the isolation and characterization of organisms from a \n\nmixed microbial culture selected under feast and famine conditions able to store PHAs \n\nfrom the different carbon sources present in Hardwood Sulphite Spent Liquor (HSSL), a \n\nby-product of the pulp and paper industry (Caima S.A.).  \n\nThe microorganisms were isolated from a PHAs-accumulating mixed microbial \n\nculture (MMC) in solid medium containing HSSL. The isolates were characterized using \n\nmicroscopy and molecular biology techniques and their identification was attempted. \n\nAdditionally, a 16S rDNA clone library was constructed in order to identify the other \n\nPHAs-accumulating bacteria present in the MMC. Finally the consumption of different \n\ncarbon sources, present in HSSL, such as acetic acid and xylose, by the isolates was \n\nstudied, and the growth kinetic parameters determined. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n3 \n \n\n2. State of the art \n\n \n\n2.1 Plastics and Bioplastics \n\n \n\nPetrochemical-based plastics are nowadays one of the most applied materials, being \n\nused in domestic, medical and industrial applications. The rather low price and versatile \n\nqualities of strength, lightness, durability and resistance to degradation are the main \n\nreasons for their huge success (Zinn et al. 2001; Khanna et al. 2005; Keshavarz et al. \n\n2010). However, these qualities became a major disadvantage of their use. Adequate \n\nmethods for plastics disposable are problematic (Castilho et al. 2009) and their \n\naccumulation in the environment is considered a world-wide problem (Khanna et al. 2005). \n\nDegradation rates in landfills are extremely low (Castilho et al. 2009) and incineration is \n\nexpensive and may generate toxic by-products, such as hydrogen cyanide produced from \n\nthe combustion of acrylonitrile-based plastics (Khanna et al. 2005; Castilho et al. 2009). \n\nRecycling is a time-consuming disposal method and the presence of a wide variety of \n\nadditives limits the use of the recycled materials (Khanna et al. 2005; Castilho et al. 2009). \n\nIn addition to this, petroleum reserves are finite, therefore a new source of durable \n\nmaterials is needed (Akaraonye et al. 2010).  \n\nBioplastics may provide a solution to the environmental hazards brought by \n\ntraditional plastics. Efforts are being made in order to find polymers of biological origin, \n\nbiodegradable and with industrial application (Zinn et al. 2001; Castilho et al. 2009). \n\nBioplastics like, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), polylactic acid (PLA) and other polymers \n\nderived from renewable resources, are already available in the market (Pei et al. 2011).  \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2 Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) \n\n \n\nPolyhydroxyalkanoates are polymers of hydroxyalkanoic acids produced by \n\nprokaryotic microorganisms (Bacteria and Archaea) accumulated in the cell cytoplasm as \n\ninsoluble spherical inclusions, to serve as carbon and energy storage. Lemoigne was the \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n4 \n \n\nfirst to clarify the chemical composition of these intracellular granules in 1926, although \n\nnumerous microbiologists had reported their presence in bacterial cells (Lemoigne 1926; \n\nKhanna et al. 2005). Lemoigne identified poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (P(3HB)) from Bacillus \n\nmegaterium (Lemoigne 1926). Since then, over 90 genera of microorganisms PHAs-\n\nproducers have been identified, in both aerobic and anaerobic environments (Zinn et al. \n\n2001). \n\nThe PHAs granules are usually between 0.2 to 0.5 \u00b5m in diameter (Sudesh et al. \n\n2000). Their structure, as represented in Figure 1, consists of a PHA core, amorphous and \n\nhydrophobic, delimited by a boundary phospholipid monolayer with attached proteins \n\ninvolved in PHAs metabolism, that include PHA synthase, phasins, depolymerizing \n\nenzymes and regulatory enzymes (Grage et al. 2009; Jendrossek 2009).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1: Structure of PHAs granules from Cupriavidus necator (Rehm 2010). \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2.1 Structure \n\n \n\nMultiple PHAs have been identified, with a great variety in terms of type and ratio \n\nof monomers (Castilho et al. 2009). Over 150 known hydroxyalkanoic acids were \n\nrecognized as monomers of these polymers (Rehm 2010). P(3HB) is the most abundant \n\nPHAs family member.  \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n5 \n \n\nPHAs structure is shown in Figure 2. Monomers are linked through an ester bond \n\nbetween the carboxyl group of one hydroxyalkanoic acid and the hydroxyl group of the \n\nnext one. This reaction is catalyzed by the PHA synthase of the microorganism. The \n\nnumber of monomers (X) can vary from 100 to 30000. The group R represents alkyl \n\ngroups and varies from methyl (C1) to tridecyl (C13). The hydroxyalkanoic acid units are \n\nall in the R configuration because of the stereo-specificity of PHA synthase, therefore \n\nPHAs are optically active (Sudesh et al. 2000). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2: General structure of polyhydroxyalkanoates (Hazer et al. 2012). \n\n \n\n \n\nStructurally, PHAs are classified on the basis of number of carbon atoms o \n\nmonomers. There are three classes: short chain length PHAs (scl-PHAs), in which the \n\nmonomers have between 3 and 5 carbon atoms, medium chain length PHAs (mcl-PHAs), \n\nconsisting of monomers with 6 to 14 carbon atoms, and long chain length PHAs (lcl-\n\nPHAs), monomers with over 14 carbon atoms (Singh et al. 2008) \n\nThese polymers are also classified according to the type of monomeric units: \n\nhomopolymers, copolymers and terpolymers (Keshavarz et al. 2010). Poly(3-\n\nhydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (P3HB-co-3HV) is an example of a copolymer that \n\nbelongs to scl-PHAs and poly(3-hydroxyhexanoate-co-3-hydroxyoctanoate) (P3HHx-co-\n\n3HO) to mcl-PHAs (Akaraonye et al. 2010).  \n\n  \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n6 \n \n\n2.2.2 Properties of PHAs \n\n \n\nThe physical properties of PHAs, such as melting temperature, glass transition \n\ntemperature and crystallinity (stiffness and flexibility), depend on the number of \n\nmonomers, their compositions, side chain length and functional group (Akaraonye et al. \n\n2010; Nitschke et al. 2011).  \n\nThe physical properties of six different PHAs and two synthetic polymers, \n\npolypropylene and polystyrene, are displayed in Table 1. As the length of the side chain of \n\nPHAs increases, the physical properties change from glassy state to more soft and sticky \n\nmaterial (Hazer et al. 2012). Scl-PHAs are crystalline polymers, rather stiff, with high \n\nmelting points, low glass transition temperatures, and some of them have higher tensile \n\nstrength than synthetic polymers. On the other hand, mcl-PHAs are thermoplastic \n\nelastomers with low crystallinity and tensile strength but high elongation to break and have \n\nlower melting points and glass transition temperatures, when compared to scl-PHAs \n\n(Akaraonye et al. 2010). \n\n \n\nTable 1: Physical properties of specific PHAs and two synthetic polymers.

Khanna et al. (2005) reviewed the \n\nstructure and properties of copolymers of different monomers. These authors concluded \n\nthat as the fraction of 3HV increased, the copolymer became tougher (impact strength \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n7 \n \n\nincreased), more flexible (Young\u2019s modulus decreased), the elongation to break increased \n\nand the melting temperature decreased without affecting degradation temperature thus \n\nallowing thermal processing of copolymer melts without thermal degradation. Therefore, \n\nmaterial properties can be controlled by adjusting the fraction of monomers during the \n\nfermentation (Khanna et al. 2005).  \n\nBiocompatibility and biodegradability are the two other main properties of PHAs, \n\nresponsible for the extensive attention these biopolymers have received (Akaraonye et al. \n\n2010). Biocompatibility is characterized by the absence of any toxic compound generated \n\nduring polymer degradation, as well as by the shape and surface porosity of the material \n\n(Castilho et al. 2009).The biocompatibility of several specific PHAs has been studied and \n\nverified, including P(3HB), P(3HB-co-3HV), P(4HB), P(3HO) and P(3HB \u2013 co-3HHx) \n\n(Chen et al. 2005; Akaraonye et al. 2010).  \n\nPHAs are biodegradable once they can be degraded producing carbon dioxide and \n\nwater, in aerobic environments, or methane, in anaerobic conditions, by a large variety of \n\nmicroorganisms when disposed in numerous ecosystems, such as soil, sewage, sea and lake \n\nwater (Lee 1996). The enzyme responsible for this degradation is the extracellular PHA \n\ndepolymerase, produced by the degrading microorganisms. This enzyme converts the \n\npolyester into water-soluble oligomers and monomers that are used as a carbon source \n\nwithin the cells (Reddy et al. 2003). The biodegradability of PHAs is influenced by the \n\nproperties of the polymer such as stereo-regularity, crystallinity, composition and \n\naccessibility of their surface to PHA depolymerizing enzymes, and by environmental \n\nconditions, temperature, moisture level, pH and nutrient supply (Sudesh et al. 2000). For \n\nexample, PHA copolymers containing 4HB monomer unit degrade more rapidly than \n\nP(3HB) or P(3HB-co-3HV) copolymers (Reddy et al. 2003).  \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2.3 Applications of PHAs \n\n \n\nThe very particular properties of PHAs, such as physical properties similar to those \n\nof synthetic polymers, biodegradability and biocompatibility, resulted in a huge \n\ncommercial interest towards these biopolymers (Grage et al. 2009; Akaraonye et al. 2010). \n\nThe major advantage of PHAs is that both the physical properties and the rate of \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n8 \n \n\ndegradation of PHAs can be altered by changing the bacterial source of the polymer and \n\nthe corresponding fermentation conditions used (Akaraonye et al. 2010). This fact allows \n\nfor tailoring PHAs composition according to the properties needed for a specific \n\napplication. \n\nIf initially PHAs were used only to make everyday articles, such as shampoo \n\nbottles and packaging materials, nowadays their range of applications is much wider, both \n\nin variety and specialization (Philip et al. 2007). The applications of PHAs may be divided \n\nin three areas: industrial, agricultural and medical, among others.  \n\n \n\n2.2.3.1 Industrial applications \n\n \n\nPHAs have been extensively tested to be used in industry (Philip et al. 2007). PHAs \n\ncan be used as substitutes for many conventional petrochemical products in applications \n\nincluding molded goods, foils, films and diaphragms and to produce food additives, \n\nflushables, non-woven fabrics, combs and pens (Philip et al. 2007; Akaraonye et al. 2010). \n\nRubber made of PHAs might be applied to paper or cardboard to form a water-resistant \n\nlayer (Nitschke et al. 2011). Furthermore, PHAs can be employed as sources for the \n\nsynthesis of enantiomerically pure chemicals such as hydroxyalkanoic acids and as raw \n\nmaterials for the production of latex paints (Akaraonye et al. 2010). Due to their \n\npiezoelectric nature, it is also possible to use PHAs to make pressure sensors for \n\nkeyboards, stretch and acceleration measuring instruments, shock wave sensors and \n\nlighters (Philip et al. 2007).  \n\n \n\n2.2.3.2 Agricultural applications \n\n \n\nPHAs can be used as protection films for agricultural purposes, for long term \n\nrelease of fertilizers, insecticides and herbicides, as well as for the stabilization of \n\ncommercial bacterial inoculants (Philip et al. 2007). Bacterial cultures used in inoculant \n\npreparations for agriculture purposes must be able to withstand stressful environments. The \n\nuse of PHAs significantly improved the shelf life, efficiency and reliability of commercial \n\ninoculants (Nitschke et al. 2011).   \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n9 \n \n\n2.2.3.3 Medical applications \n\n \n\nMany studies using various animal models have demonstrated that different PHAs, \n\nnamely P(3HB), P(3HB-co-3HV), P(4HB), P(HO) and P(3HB-co-HHx), possess the \n\ncharacteristics needed for implant applications and controlled drug release, namely, \n\nbiodegradability, biocompatibility and thermoprocessibility (Chen et al. 2005). Therefore, \n\nPHAs have been used for the production of temporary stents, bone plates, nails and screws, \n\nsurgical sutures and other medically relevant materials (Nitschke et al. 2011).  \n\nAccording to the requirements for the different applications, PHAs can be blended, \n\nsurface modified or composited with other PHAs and other polymers, enzymes or even \n\ninorganic materials to further adjust their mechanical properties or biocompatibility. The \n\nmany possibilities to tailor-made PHAs for medical implant applications have shown this \n\nclass of materials to have a bright future as tissue engineering materials (Chen et al. 2005). \n\n \n\n2.2.3.4 Other Applications \n\n \n\nA recent development is the potential use of PHAs granules, formed inside \n\nrecombinant bacterial cells, as tailor-made functionalized micro- and nano-beads in which \n\nspecific proteins attached to the PHA core have been engineered to display various protein \n\nfunctions. The application performance of engineered PHA beads in high-affinity \n\nbioseparation, enzyme immobilization, protein production, diagnosis and as an antigen \n\ndelivery system has been demonstrated, and the technology is now being commercialized \n\n(Rehm 2010).  \n\nFurthermore, after used as bioplastic, PHAs monomers may be further methyl \n\nesterified to become hydroxyalkanoate methyl ester, which produces combustion heats \n\ncomparable to ethanol, and so might be used as biofuels (Gao et al. 2011).  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n10 \n \n\n2.2.4 Commercially available PHAs and their applications \n\n \n\nSeveral commercial brands of PHAs are currently available and some of them are \n\nsummarized in Table 2. PHAs are becoming price-competitive with petroleum-based \n\npolymers. The price of synthetic plastics is around 1\u20ac/kg, for polypropylene. In 2006, PHA \n\ncost was about 3.5 to 5.0 \u20ac/kg. Nevertheless this price has significantly decreased (Table 2) \n\n(Chanprateep 2010). Among PHAs-manufacturing companies, the main company with a \n\nlarge production is the USA biotech company Metabolix, Inc. in Cambridge, \n\nMassachusetts (Chanprateep 2010).  \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 2: Three industrially available PHAs, the companies who produce them and their \n\napplications (Philip et al. 2007; Chanprateep 2010). \n\nPolymer Trade \n\nname \n\nManufactures Price  \n\n(kg\n-1\n\n)  \n\n(in 2010) \n\nApplications \n\nP(3HB) and \n\nP(HB-co-HV) \n\nBiomer\u00ae Biomer Inc. \n\n(Germany) \n\n3.0 \u2013 5.0 \u20ac -polymer pellets sold \n\ncommercially for use in classical \n\ntransformation processes \n\n-production of articles (combs, \n\npens and bullets) \n\n \n\nP(3HB) \n\n \n\nMirel\u2122  \n\n \n\nMetabolix \n\n(USA) \n\n \n\n \n\n1.50 \u20ac \n\n \n\n-coat paper and paperboards  \n\n-injection, blow moulding, film \n\nproduction and for electric and \n\nelectronic packaging \n\n-produce shampoo bottles, motor \n\noil bottles and disposable razors \n\n \n\nP(3HB-co-3HHx)  \n\n \n\nNodax\u2122 \n\n \n\n \n\nProcter and \n\nGamble (USA) \n\n \n\n2.50 \u20ac \n\n \n\n-available as foam, fibres or non-\n\nwovens, films and latex \n\n-produce flushables, medical \n\nsurgical garments, upholstery, \n\ncarpet, packaging, compostable \n\nbags and lids or tubs for \n\nthermoformed articles \n\n-coating for fertilizers, herbicides \n\nor insecticides. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n11 \n \n\n2.3 PHAs production process \n\n \n\nBacterial biosynthesis of PHAs is usually in response to stress conditions such as \n\nnutrient limitation, for example nitrogen or phosphate with excess carbon source. Bacteria \n\nin this group include Cupriavidus necator (formerly called Alcaligenes eutrophus, \n\nWaustersia eutropha or Ralstonia eutropha). However, some bacteria, such as Alcaligenes \n\nlatus, are able to accumulate PHAs under non-limiting conditions (Akaraonye et al. 2010; \n\nKeshavarz et al. 2010).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3: Schematic representation of PHAs biosynthesis from sugar catabolism, fatty acid ?-\n\noxidation and intermediary pathways (Gumel et al. 2012). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n12 \n \n\nThe biosynthesis of PHAs from sugars is the best known pathway among the PHAs \n\nbiosynthetic pathways. It normally begins with glycolysis of the sugar to pyruvate, which \n\nis converted to acetyl-CoA via the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) oxidation pathway. \n\nThen, two molecules of acetyl-CoA are condensed to form acetoacetyl-CoA, by the action \n\nof ?-ketothiolase, an enzyme encoded by the phaA gene. Acetoacetyl-CoA is reduced by \n\nacetoacetyl-CoA reductase (phaB) to form the monomer of (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, the \n\nbuilding block of PHAs. Finally, PHA synthase (phaC) polymerizes the monomers to \n\nPHAs (Philip et al. 2007; Gumel et al. 2012). The three different pathways for PHAs \n\nbiosynthesis are represented in Figure 3. \n\nThe current industrial production processes are mainly based on the use of pure \n\ncultures of microorganisms in their wild form, such as Cupriavidus necator, Alcaligenes \n\nlatus, or using genetically modified strains, such as recombinant Escherichia coli, by \n\ncloning the PHA synthase genes from many microorganisms, including C. necator (Lemos \n\net al. 2006; Chen 2009; Akaraonye et al. 2010; Chanprateep 2010). C. necator has been the \n\nmost commonly used wild type strain for the industrial production of P(3HB), P(3HB-co-\n\n4HB) and P(3HB-co-3HV). E. coli has been favored in the choice as host due to its ability \n\nto grow fast, to achieve high cell density from several inexpensive substrates and simple \n\npolymer purification (Lemos et al. 2006; Akaraonye et al. 2010).  \n\nOver the past few years, the search for alternative processes in order to reduce the \n\nPHAs production costs has significantly increased. The use of complex low cost carbon \n\nsubstrates and mixed microbial cultures has been proposed to reduce these costs (Serafim \n\net al. 2008; Gumel et al. 2012). \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.1 Mixed Microbial Cultures \n\n \n\nIn order to reduce the costs of industrial PHAs production, the choice of the \n\nmicroorganism used depends on several factors that include the ability of cells to use \n\ninexpensive carbons sources, the growth rate, the polymer productivity, the quality and \n\namount of PHAs obtained and the cost of the downstream processes (Chen 2009; \n\nChanprateep 2010).  \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n13 \n \n\nAn interesting alternative to pure cultures is the use of mixed microbial cultures \n\n(MMC), such as activated sludge from wastewater treatment plants. The use of MMC \n\naffords the advantage that sterile conditions are not needed, thus saving the energy and \n\nequipment costs (Serafim et al. 2008; Villano et al. 2010). PHAs accumulation by mixed \n\ncultures was first detected in wastewater treatment plants designed for biological \n\nphosphorus removal (EBPR), which operate with alternated anaerobic and aerobic cycles \n\n(Serafim et al. 2008). \n\nActivated sludge with PHAs storage capacity may also be observed in aerobic \n\nwastewater treatment plants, in a process known as \u201caerobic dynamic feeding\u201d (ADF) or \n\n\u201cfeast and famine\u201d. In this process the activated sludge undergoes consecutive periods of \n\nexternal accessibility (feast) and unavailability (famine). PHAs storage occurs due to an \n\ninternal growth limitation that results from insufficient intracellular components such as \n\nenzymes or RNA (Dias et al. 2006; Serafim et al. 2008). Under such conditions, \n\nmicroorganisms able to store the substrate during the feast phase possess a competitive \n\nadvantage over the others, as the stored polymer can act as an internal carbon source \n\nduring the famine phase. Therefore, under these conditions, activated sludge can be \n\nenriched with PHAs-accumulating microorganisms and its overall PHAs-storage potential \n\nis greatly increased (Serafim et al. 2008; Villano et al. 2010).  \n\nPHAs production processes by mixed cultures are usually operated in two or three \n\nsteps, depending on the type of substrate used as feedstock (Dias et al. 2006). The three-\n\nstep process consists firstly of a fermentative stage. In this stage occurs acidogenic \n\nfermentation, thus converting the biodegradable waste into a high-concentration mixture of \n\nacetate and other volatile fatty acids (VFAs), the substrates used by MMC for PHAs \n\nstorage. The second step consists of an enrichment stage. Activated sludge process is \n\nperformed at high organic load imposing periodic feeding in a fully aerobic SBR, in order \n\nto enrich and produce sludge with a high storage response. Finally, an accumulation step is \n\nperformed. The storage response of the produced sludge is aerobically exploited in order to \n\nincrease the amount of polymer produced (Dias et al. 2006; Villano et al. 2010). The two \n\nstep process lacks the first stage described (Dias et al. 2006).  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n14 \n \n\n2.3.2 Low Value Substrates \n\n \n\nThe selection of a suitable substrate is an important factor to optimize PHAs \n\nproduction since it affects the final cell content, composition and properties of the polymer.  \n\n40% of total operating expenses of PHAs production are related to the raw materials, and \n\nmore than 70% of this cost is attributed to the carbon source. Because of these costs there \n\nhas been considerable interest in the use of cheap carbon substrates (Salehizadeh et al. \n\n2004; Akaraonye et al. 2010).  \n\nSeveral agricultural or industrial waste materials have been explored as cheap \n\ncarbon and nitrogen sources for PHAs production. Recycling of wastes generated from \n\nagriculture and industries for PHAs production is not only crucial for reduction of \n\nproduction costs but also for waste management. Process economics have revealed that the \n\nuse of inexpensive and renewable carbon substrates as PHAs carbon feedstock can \n\ncontribute to as much as 40-50% reduction in the overall production cost (Nitschke et al. \n\n2011). The various cheap carbon sources already tested include whey, wastewater from \n\nolive mills, molasses, corn steep liquor, starchy wastewater, palm oil mill effluent and \n\nsubproducts of lignocellulosic biomass processing, such as hardwood sulphite spent liquor, \n\nHSSL (Keenan et al. 2006; Akaraonye et al. 2010).  \n\n \n\n2.3.2.1 Hardwood Sulphite Spent Liquor (HSSL) \n\n \n\nHSSL is a by-product resulting from the sulphite pulping of hardwood, such as \n\nEucalyptus globulus, and is usually concentrated and burned for chemicals and energy \n\nrecovery (Figure 4) (Lawford et al. 1993; Marques et al. 2009). Acidic sulphite \n\nmagnesium-based pulping of Eucalyptus globulus wood occurs usually around 130\u00baC and a \n\npH of 1.5 (Marques et al. 2009).  \n\n  \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n15 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4:Representation of the pulp production process by acidic magnesium-based sulphite \n\npulping of Eucalyptus globulus wood (Fernandes et al. 2012) . \n\n \n\n \n\nThe chemical composition of HSSL is listed in Table 3. The main components are \n\nlignosulphonates and sugars, with concentrations around 78 g L\n-1\n\n and 50 g L\n-1\n\n, \n\nrespectively. The sugars were obtained from the partial hydrolysis of hemicelluloses \n\n(glucuronoxylan, glucomannan and glucans), and the D-Xylose is present at highest \n\nconcentration, in both monomeric (about 70 to 75%) and oligomeric (about 25 to 30%) \n\nforms (Marques et al. 2009; Xavier et al. 2010). Due to this fact, HSSL is a potential \n\nsubstrate for bioprocessing (Marques et al. 2009).  \n\n \n\nTable 3: Eucalypt HSSL chemical composition (Xavier et al. 2010). \n\nComponents Concentration (g L\n-1\n\n) \n\nLignosulphonates 78.2 \u00b1 0.6 \n\nAcetic Acid 8.2 \u00b1 0.3 \n\nFurfural&lt;0.1 \n\nAsh 19.8 \u00b1 0.2 \n\nD-Xylose 24.6 \u00b1 0.5 \n\nD-Mannose 8.5 \u00b1 0.9 \n\nL-Arabinose 7.8 \u00b1 0.3 \n\nD-Galactose 4.5 \u00b1 0.1 \n\nD-Glucose 2.3 \u00b1 0.1 \n\nL-Rhamnose 1.6 \u00b1 0.3 \n\nL-Fucose 0.4 \u00b1 0.3 \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n16 \n \n\nHowever, the acidic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials also releases several \n\ncompounds derived from sugar and degradation of lignin, namely furfural, \n\nhydroxymethylfurfural, acetic acid, syringic acid, and others (Mussatto et al. 2004; \n\nMarques et al. 2009; Xavier et al. 2010). Some of these compounds, such as furfural and \n\nacetic acid, are toxic to fermentative microorganisms and inhibit their metabolism, which \n\nis a major factor limiting HSSL bioprocessing (Mussatto et al. 2004). Furfural is a \n\ndegradation product from the hydrolysis of pentose sugars, namely xylose. It can inhibit \n\ncells and affect the specific growth rate and cell-mass yield depending on its concentration \n\nin the fermentation medium (Palmqvist et al. 2000). Acetic acid derives from acetyl groups \n\npresent in the hemicellulose. According to the fermentative process conditions the toxicity \n\nof this acid differs (Mussatto et al. 2004). When the medium pH is low, acetic acid is in the \n\nundissociated form and is capable to diffuse across the cell membrane (liposoluble). Inside \n\nthe cell it dissociates and accumulates in the cytoplasm, causing the decrease of internal \n\npH, inhibiting cell activity and even causing death (Lawford et al. 1993; Mussatto et al. \n\n2004). \n\nThe use of HSSL as raw material for the production of value added products fits \n\nwell to the biorefinery concept, developed to decrease the dependence from fossil \n\nresources and to improve the economic sustainability of pulp mills (Marques et al. 2009; \n\nXavier et al. 2010). The production of several products has been tested using this by-\n\nproduct as substrate, which includes bioethanol (Lawford et al. 1993; Xavier et al. 2010; \n\nPereira et al. 2012), single cell protein (Pereira et al. 2012), bacterial cellulose (Carreira et \n\nal. 2011) and PHAs (Queir\u00f3s 2012). \n\n \n\n2.3.2.1.1 PHAs production by MMC from HSSL \n\nThe possibility of using HSSL as a substrate for PHAs production by a MMC was \n\nstudied by Queir\u00f3s (2012). The author performed the selection of PHAs-accumulating \n\norganisms from activated sludge collected in a wastewater treatment plant, which was \n\nsubmitted to ADF in Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) using HSSL as substrate. The \n\nselected MMC reached a maximum PHAs content of 67.6% and consumed the total \n\ncontent of acetic acid and a small part of xylose (Queir\u00f3s 2012).  \n\n  \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n17 \n \n\n2.4 Microbial Community Analysis of Selected MMC under ADF Conditions \n\n \n\nPHAs productivity and content obtained by activated sludge has been generally \n\nlower than the obtained by pure cultures. One of the main factors on the development of a \n\ncompetitive process for PHAs production with MMC is the selection of organisms with \n\nhigh storage capacity (Lemos et al. 2008). Therefore, efforts have been made towards the \n\nidentification of microorganisms responsible for PHAs storage, including production by \n\nselectec activated sludge under highly dynamic conditions to promote as much storage as \n\npossible (Dionisi et al. 2006; Serafim et al. 2006; Lemos et al. 2008; Jiang et al. 2011; \n\nJiang et al. 2012; Moita et al. 2012; Queir\u00f3s 2012). \n\nDionisi et al. (2006), applied molecular methods to identify PHAs-accumulating \n\norganisms in an ADF reactor. The authors used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis \n\n(DGGE) and performed 16S rRNA (ribosomal ribonucleic acid) clone library (Figure 5). \n\nThe most represented group was Betaproteobacteria (Thauera, Alcaligenes, Comamonas, \n\nAchromobacter). The second phylogenetic group characterizing the SBR sludge was \n\nGammaproteobacteria (Kluyvera, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter) and Alphaproteobacteria \n\n(Xantobacter, Curtobacterium) were also present. It was found that Thauera genus was the \n\ndominant one and was the first time it was describe as PHAs-producer. Fluorescence In \n\nSitu Hybridization (FISH) method in combination with Nile Blue staining was employed \n\nby Serafim et al. (2006), for the characterization of the microbial population in two \n\nreactors under ADF conditions, one adapted to acetate and the other to propionate. The \n\nresults showed that the main PHAs-producers belonged to Betaproteobacteria and \n\nAlphaproteobacteria, and the main responsible for the PHAs storage was affiliated to the \n\ngenus Azoarcus (Betaproteobacteria). Lemos et al. (2008) determined the PHAs storing \n\nbacteria selected under ADF conditions, using propionate or acetate as carbon source. The \n\nauthors applied reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on \n\nmicromanipulated cells and confirmed by FISH. Four genera were detected, Amaricoccus, \n\nAzoarcus, Thauera and Paracoccus, being the latter rarely present. \n\n  \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n18 \n \n\na)   b) \n\n \n\nFigure 5:a) DGGE profile of the community structure of the activated sludge used as SBR \n\ninoculum (I) and their corresponding SBR selected sludge (II) (Dionisi et al. 2006); b) RT-PCR \n\nstategy applied for the identification of PHAs-accumulating organisms (Lemos et al. 2008). \n\n \n\n \n\nThe microbial community analysis of studies of PHAs production by selected \n\nactivated sludge using complex substrates has also been performed. Jiang et al. (2011) used \n\nlactate as carbon source and Plasticicumulans acidivorans and Thauera selenatis were \n\nidentified as the predominant bacterial species. In 2012, Jiang and co-workers, using paper \n\nmill wastewater, found a large amount of P. acidivorans, which was the main PHAs-\n\nproducer, which accounted for 56% of the biomass, and a flanking population, which \n\nexhibited limited PHAs producing capacity (Jiang et al., 2012). Moita et al. (2012) used \n\nbio-oil from the fast-pyrolysis of chicken beds as substrate in a SBR under ADF conditions \n\nand observed the dominance of Betaproteobacteria over the Alpha and \n\nGamaproteobacteria using FISH. Thauera genus was found to be the dominant genus and \n\nAmaricocus and Zooglea were also detected (Moita et al., 2012). Finally, Queir\u00f3s (2012) \n\nafter the selection of PHAs-accumulating organisms using HSSL under ADF conditions \n\nanalyzed the selected culture by FISH. The dominant bacteria belonged to \n\nAlphaproteobacteria, but Beta and Gammaproteobacteria were also present. At genus \n\nlevel were detected Paracoccus and Defluvicoccus, both belonging to \n\nAlphaproteobacteria.   \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n19 \n \n\n \n\n2.5 Isolation of PHAs-Accumulating Bacteria from Activated Sludge \n\n \n\nNumerous researchers have attempted to isolate PHAs producing microorganisms \n\nfrom various sources aiming to discover and identify novel species with high PHAs \n\nproduction capacity (Sangkharak et al. 2012). The use of naturally producing \n\nmicroorganisms is economical as there is great potential for producing PHAs in low-cost \n\nsubstrates, which can reduce PHA production costs (Thirumala et al. 2010).  \n\nIn addition to the microbial community analysis, in order to a have a better \n\nunderstanding on the microbial strains of activated sludge responsible for PHAs \n\naccumulation, several studies have performed the isolation of PHAs-accumulating bacteria \n\nfrom activated sludge. The isolations were generally performed using platting techniques \n\nand the screening of the PHAs-accumulating microorganisms by Nile Blue staining. The \n\nisolates were identified, by biochemical and 16S rRNA sequence analysis and phylogenetic \n\nstudies, and their capacity of PHAs production evaluated (Table 4).  \n\nThe first successful isolation of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from activated sludge \n\nwas reported by Liu et al. in 2000. The activated sludge was collected from an EBPR \n\nsystem and was enriched in an anaerobic-oxic system fed with acetate. The isolates were \n\nable to accumulate the copolymer P(3HB-co-3HV) (Liu et al. 2000).  \n\nThe possibility of PHAs production by activated sludge isolates using food wastes \n\nas substrates was performed in 2001 and 2002. Law and co-workers (2001) isolated a \n\nbacteria related to Bacillus megaterium able to use both food wastes and accumulate \n\nP(3HB), whereas the Klebsiella isolated by Wong et al. in 2002 produced P(3HB-co-HV) \n\ncopolymers with different monomer compositions (Table 4). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n20 \n \n\nTable 4: PHAs production from bacterial isolates from activated sludge. \n\nReference Isolated Bacteria \n\nfrom Activated \n\nSludge \n\nCarbon source Polymer \n\nproduced \n\nPHA \n\nyield \n1 \n\n(%) \n\nFermentation \n\nConditions \n\n(Law et al. \n\n2001) \n\nRelated to Bacillus \n\nmegaterium \n\nMalt waste P(3HB) - Batch: 3.7 L bioreactor \n\n37\u00baC and pH 7.0 \n\n \nSoy waste P(3HB) - \n\n(Wong et al. \n\n2002) \n\nKlebsiella spp. Malt waste P(3HB-co-3HV) \n\nratio: 93:7 \n\n- - \n\nSoy waste P(3HB-co-3HV) \n\nratio: 79:21 \n\n \n\n- - \n\n(Liu et al. \n\n2002) \n\nSphaerotilus \n\nnatans \n\nGlucose P(3HB-co-3HV) \n\nratio: 30:70 \n\n15.0 Fed-batch: 10 L \n\nbioreactor; 30\u00baC; 300 \n\nrpm; 0.5 (v/v) aeration \n\n \n\n(Akar et al. \n\n2006) \n\nMicrolunatus \n\nphosphovorus  \n\n(DMS 10555) \n\nGlucose P(3HB) 23.97 Batch: 2 L bioreactor; \n\n30\u00baC, 250 rpm \n\nGlucose P(3HB) 25.91 Batch, Anaerobic-\n\naerobic cycles; 30\u00baC Acetate \n\n \n\nP(3HB) 23.23 \n\n(Kourmentza \n\net al. 2009) \n\nPseudomonas sp. \n2 \n\n \n\nVFAs mixture (Acetate, \n\npropionate and butyrate), \n\nwith N limitation \n\nP(3HB) 23.77 Batch: 1 L Erlenmeyer \n\nFlasks; room \n\ntemperature; 250 rpm \n\nVFAs mixture, with N and \n\nO2 limitation \n\nP(3HB) 50.61 \n\nPseudomonas sp. \n3 \n\n \n\nVFAs mixture, with N \n\nlimitation \n\nP(3HB) 13.58 \n\nVFAs mixture, with N and \n\nO2 limitation \n\n \n\nP(3HB) 11.22 \n\n(Thirumala et \n\nal. 2010) \n\nBacillus sp. 112A Glucose P(3HB) 67.73 Batch: 500 mL \n\nFlask;30\u00baC; 150 rpm Sucrose P(3HB) 58.50 \n\nStarch \n\n \n\nP(3HB) 50.50 \n\n(Chen et al. \n\n2011) \n\nGamma \n\nproteobacterium  \n\nWD-3 \n\nSodium butyrate P(3HB-co-3HV) \n\nratio: 35:65 \n\n45.0 Fed-batch: 250 mL \n\nErlenmeyer flask; \n\n30\u00baC;180 rpm \n\n \n\n(Venkateswar \n\nReddy et al. \n\n2012b) \n\nPseudomonas \n\notitidis \n\nSynthetic acids P(3HB-co-3HV) 58.0 Batch: flasks; 120 rpm; \n\n28\u00baC Acidogenic effluent P(3HB-co-3HV) 54.0 \n\n1\nPHA yield is given in terms of PHA content (% of cell dry weight); \n\n2\n Pseudomonas sp. with 99% similarity with Pseudomonas putida ATCC 17390, Pseudomonas sp. strain ONBA and \n\nPseudomonas sp. strain HR13; \n\n3\nPseudomonas sp. with 99% similarity with Pseudomonas putida ATCC 17453 and  Pseudomonas putida ATCC 17514. \n\n. \n\n \n\nThe production of the copolymer P(3HB-co-3HV) from inherent bacteria in \n\nactivated sludge was further evaluated due to the advantage of production of the copolymer \n\nonce PHAs copolymers composed of primarily 3HB with a fraction of longer chain \n\nmonomers, such as 3HV, are more flexible and tougher plastics, and such plastics typically \n\nhave a wider range of applications. Liu et al. (2002) isolated Sphaerotilus natans and \n\ninvestigated its ability to produce P(3HB-co-HV) using glucose and peptone, or by adding \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n21 \n \n\nvaleric acid or sodium propionate as precursor and concluded that the highest 3HV content \n\nof the copolymer was 70% using glucose as carbon source and sodium propionate as \n\nprecursor. Chen and co-workers, in 2011, isolated the Gamma proteobacterium WD-3 \n\nstrain. The effects of altering of the C/N ratio (mol mol\n-1\n\n) and changing in the carbon \n\nsource (propionate, acetate and butyrate) on PHAs production were investigated in batch \n\nexperiments. The highest PHAs content (22%) was obtained for a C/N ratio of 35. The use \n\nof different carbon sources produced a different combination of monomers in the PHAs, \n\nand the authors concluded that this strain could accumulate PHAs containing both the 3HB \n\nand 3HV monomers in the presence of a single carbon source. Finally, the authors \n\nperformed a fed-batch experiment, with a C/N ratio of 35, in which the maximum PHAs \n\naccumulation was 45% of cell dry weight and the proportion of 3HV occupied one-third of \n\nthe PHA end product. Venkateswar Reddy et al. (2012a) performed the isolation of several \n\nmicroorganisms involved in PHAs accumulation and waste treatment, after the enrichment \n\nof activated sludge under ADF conditions. The authors selected over 30 phenotypically \n\ndifferent colonies, and 7 of these isolates were further characterized. The dominant \n\norganisms were related to phylum Firmicutes, and were identified as B. subtilis, B. badius, \n\nB. tequilensis, Staphylococcus arlettae and Enterococcus italicus. The other two isolates \n\nbelonged to Gamaproteobacteria, Serratiaureilytica and Pseudomonas otitidis \n\n(Venkateswar Reddy et al. 2012a). PHAs production from the isolated Pseudomonas \n\notitidis was further investigated, using two substrates, synthetic acids and acidogenic \n\neffluent from biohydrogen reactor. The results obtained revealed that this isolate showed \n\nability to grow and accumulate PHAs (Table 4) with simultaneous waste remediation \n\n(Venkateswar Reddy et al. 2012b). \n\nThe production of homopolymer P(3HB) has also been studied. PHAs production \n\nby the isolated Microlunatus phosphovorus was studied by Akar et al. (2006) from an \n\nEBPR system. The authors investigated the PHA storage behavior of the isolate under \n\ndifferent growth conditions and using different carbon sources. Two different strategies \n\nwere employed, first batch-growth systems using chemically defined growth media with \n\nglucose as only carbon source followed a batch-growth system with anaerobic-aerobic \n\ncycles and varying concentrations of glucose or acetate as the sole carbon sources, similar \n\nto EBPR processes. After evaluation of all the experiments, the main polymer produced \n\nwas P(3HB) with yields between 20-30% of cell dry weight and the highest P(3HB) \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n22 \n \n\nproduction was observed in batch-growth similar to EBPR with glucose as carbon source. \n\nKourmentza et al (2009) isolated two Pseudomonas sp. from an enriched MMC by \n\nalternating cycles between limitation of carbon and nitrogen substrates. The isolates were \n\nstudied in terms of PHAs accumulation under both nitrogen limitation and simultaneous \n\nnitrogen and oxygen limitation conditions, with a synthetic medium with volatile fatty \n\nacids as carbon source, and the results compared to the use of the mixed culture. The \n\nauthors concluded that the enriched culture was more promising for PHAs production \n\nwhen compared to the two isolates, from that same mixed culture. However, the high \n\npercentage of PHAs accumulation in the first isolate (50.61%), under nitrogen and oxygen \n\nlimitation indicated that this specific strain could lead to quite high yields under properly \n\nselected limiting conditions. Thirumala et al. (2010) studied the P(3HB) production by an \n\nisolated bacteria belonging to genus Bacillus sp. from different carbon sources (galactose, \n\nfructose, glucose, mannitol, sucrose, maltose and starch). Bacillus sp. 112A produced a \n\nmaximum of 67.73% P(3HB) from glucose, 58.50% from sucrose, followed by 50.50% \n\nfrom starch as carbon substrates, but also produced the polymer from the others carbon \n\nsources but with a lower PHA yield. The authors also performed the polymer analysis. \n\n  \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n23 \n \n\n3. Methods and Materials \n\n \n\n3.1 Culture \n\n \n\nThe mixed microbial culture used in this work as a source of microorganisms was \n\ncollected from the Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) under Aerobic Dynamic Feeding in \n\norder to select PHA-accumulating organisms from HSSL by Queir\u00f3s (2012). \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2 Culture Medium \n\n \n\n3.2.1 HSSL pretreatment \n\n \n\nThe hardwood sulphite spent liquor (HSSL) from magnesium based acidic sulphite \n\npulping of Eucalyptus globulus was supplied by Caima \u2013 Ind\u00fastria de Celulose SA \n\n(Const\u00e2ncia Portugal). Pre-evaporated HSSL was collected from inlet evaporator in a set of \n\nmultiple-effect evaporators to avoid the presence of free SO2 in liquor. The pretreatment of \n\nHSSL consisted in pH adjustment to 7.0 with 6M KOH followed by aeration with \n\ncompressed air (2 h.L\n-1\n\n). Afterwards, the liquor was centrifuged for 1 hour at 2000 rpm. \n\nThe precipitated colloids were then filtered off using a 1 \u00b5m glass microfiber filter \n\n(Ahlstrom, grade 131) (Xavier et al. 2010).  \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.2 Medium composition \n\n \n\nThe medium selected was the same used in the SBR for the selection of PHA-\n\nstoring organism by Queir\u00f3s 2012. The three carbon sources used were either the by-\n\nproduct HSSL (4.2 gCOD.L\n-1\n\n) or one of the two major carbon sources present in HSSL, \n\nSodium acetate (CH3COONa) and Xylose (C5H10O5) in concentrations of 0.172g.L\n-1\n\n and \n\n0.360 g.L\n-1\n\n, respectively. The composition in micronutrients of culture medium is listed in \n\nTable 5. Phosphate salts were prepared separately, in order to avoid precipitation with \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n24 \n \n\nmagnesium salts during sterilization. The pH of the medium was kept above 7.0 before \n\nsterilization and for solid medium the amount of agar used was 20 g.L\n-1\n\n. The solutions \n\nwere then autoclaved and left to cool down in a laminar flow hood. After cooling, \n\nphosphates and carbon source were added to the medium and then it was distributed to \n\npetri dishes.  \n\n \n\nTable 5: Concentration of nutrients in the culture medium. \n\nCompound Concentration (g.L\n-1\n\n) \n\nMonopotassium phosphate (KH2PO4) 0.016 \n\nDipotassium phosphate (K2HPO4) 0.064 \n\nMagnesium sulfate heptahydrate (MgSO4\u00b77H2O) 0.160 \n\nCalcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSO4\u00b72H2O) 0.080 \n\nIron(III) chloride (FeCl3) 0.020 \n\nSodium Molybdate dihydrate (Na2MoO4\u00b72H2O) 0.008 \n\nAmmonium chloride (NH4Cl) 0.160 \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3 Bacterial isolation \n\n \n\nIn order to isolate some PHA-accumulating bacteria from the selected MMC, solid \n\nculture medium was prepared (Table 5).A volume of 50 \u00b5L of the selected mixed culture \n\nwere spread onto agar growth medium and the inoculated plates were therefore incubated \n\nat 20\u00baC. Pure cultures of PHA-storing bacteria were isolated by repeated streaking of \n\nisolated colonies. The purity of the isolates was evaluated performing gram staining and \n\nFISH analysis. The cultures were then inoculated in liquid medium, 50 mL with the \n\nrespective carbon source from where it was isolated, to determine the growth rate. Then, a \n\n400 mL Erlenmeyer was inoculated with an inoculum from the previous liquid medium. \n\nKinetic tests were performed in triplicates. Samples were taken to evaluate the culture \n\ngrowth (absorbance at 420 nm), substrate consumption and to perform Nile Blue staining. \n\n  \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n25 \n \n\n3.4 Analytical Methods \n\n \n\n3.4.1 Carbon Sources Analysis \n\n \n\nOverall substrate consumption was determined using the Chemical Oxygen \n\nDemand (COD), through Spectroquant\u00ae photometric kit (Merck), according to the kit\u2019s \n\ninstructions. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.4.2 Biomass concentration \n\n \n\nVSS (volatile suspended solids) were determined according to Standard Methods \n\n(American Public Health Association 2005). 50 mL of sample were filtered using a filter of \n\n1 \u00b5m (Whatman). The filter was dried in the oven at 105\u00baC for 2 hours, for the \n\ndetermination of the Total Suspended Solids (TSS). Afterwards, the same filter was placed \n\nin the muffle furnace at 505\u00baC for 2 hours, for the VSS determination. The determination \n\nof biomass concentration was performed through the conversion of the absorbance at 420 \n\nnm (Abs420nm) into concentration using a calibration curve of Abs420nm versus biomass \n\nconcentration, in VSS (g.L\n-1\n\n). \n\n \n\n3.5 Sample fixation and storage \n\n \n\nBiomass was harvested by centrifugation and ressuspended in 1 volume of 1x \n\nPhosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). This washing step was performed two more times. 1 \n\nvolume of paraformaldehyde (4% (v/v)) was then added to the eppendorf with the \n\nressuspended biomass and afterwards incubated at 4\u00baC for 2 hours. The fixed sample was \n\ncentrifuged (5 min, 4\u00baC, 12 000 rpm) and the supernatant poured away. Then the sample \n\nwas ressuspended in 1 volume of ice-cold 1xPBS and 1 volume of ice-cold 96% (v/v) \n\nethanol was added. The sample was stored at -20\u00baC (Amann et al. 1995). \n\n  \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n26 \n \n\n \n\n3.6 Gram Staining \n\n \n\nAfter sample fixation on slide, followed by air drying, the microscope slide was \n\nstained for 1 minute with crystal violet solution.

Lastly, the slide was covered with a \n\nsolution of safranin for 1 minute and the washed with water. The slide was left to air dry \n\nand then it was observed under oil immersion at 1000x magnification with direct \n\nillumination resorting to Zeis Axioskop equipped with JVC TK-128OE Color Video \n\nCamera (VLC software), Figure 6 (Jenkins et al. 1986). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6: Optic microscope Zeis Axioskop equipped with JVC TK-128OE Color Video Camera. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n27 \n \n\n \n\n3.7 Nile Blue Staining \n\n \n\nThin smears were prepared on microscope slides.

Afterwards, 10 \u00b5L of hybridization buffer \n\n(previously prepared and according to stringency of the probes used) were added to each \n\nwell of the slide and the remainder used to moisten a tissue paper for the hybridization \n\nchamber. Finally, 0.5 \u00b5L of probe (50 ng.\u00b5L\n-1\n\n) were added to the wells and the slide placed \n\nin the hybridization chamber at 46\u00baC for 1.5 hours. Then, the slide was lightly washed with \n\nthe pre-heated washing buffer and subsequently placed in a Falcon tube, containing the \n\nwashing buffer at 48\u00baC for 15 minutes. Cold Milli-Q water was used to remove the \n\nwashing buffer from the slide. After air-drying, the slide was mounted with Vectorshield \n\nmounting medium containing DAPI stain (Amann et al. 1995).  \n\nThe list of the probes used is shown in Table 6.

The solution was incubated for 40 minutes at 37\u00b0C. A volume of 60 \u00b5l \n\nproteinase K (20 mg.mL\n-1\n\n) and 10 \u00b5l 20% SDS were then added, and the solution was \n\nmixed by gentle inversion and incubated for a further 30 minutes at 50\u00b0C. The sample was \n\nmixed on a Mini-Beadbeater (Biospec Products), at the low setting for 2 minutes in the \n\npresence of 500 \u00b5l phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:24:1), 200 \u00b5l 20% SDS and \n\napproximately 0.3 g acid-washed zirconium beads (0.1 mm of diameter). After \n\ncentrifuging at approximately 12 000 g at 4\u00b0C for 3 minutes to deposit the beads and \n\nsample debris, the lysate was extracted with 1 volume phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol \n\n(24:24:1). The nucleic acids from the approximately 500 ml aqueous phase were then \n\nprecipitated by adding an equal volume of 2-propanol and 0.1 volume 3 M sodium acetate, \n\npH 5.2, and incubating for 20 minutes on ice. The DNA pellet was recovered by \n\ncentrifuging the solution at 12 000 g for 20 minutes at 4\u00b0C.

The primers used were 27 forward (f) and 1492 reverse (r), for the isolates and \n\ngenomic DNA of the MMC and T7f and U19r, which are specific plasmid primers, for the \n\nfirst screening of clones, and T7f was used with M13r, for the second screening Table 7. \n\nFor the PCR the Perkin Elmer GeneAmp PCR System 2400 was used, programmed with \n\ntwo different cycle conditions according to the used primers.  \n\nWhen 27f and 1492r were employed, those were the following cycles: \n\n- 94C for 4 minutes (1 cycle) \n\n- 94\u00baC for 1 minute, 48\u00baC for 0,30 minute and 72\u00baC for 2 minutes (35 cycles) \n\n- 72\u00baC for 12 minutes (1 Cycle). \n\nWhen T7f and U19r were used, or T7f and M13r, the cycles were the following: \n\n- 95C for 2 minutes (1 cycle) \n\n- 95\u00baC for 0.5 minute, 57\u00baC for 1 minute and 72\u00baC for 2 minutes (35 cycles) \n\n- 72\u00baC for 10 minutes (1 Cycle). \n\nAfter the last cycle, the samples were cooled down until 4\u00baC and an agarose (1%) \n\nelectrophoresis was performed to check if there was amplification. Afterwards PCR \n\nproducts were purified using the QIAquick\u00ae PCR purification kit of (Quiagen, Milan, \n\nItaly) and quantified using the NanoDrop2000 Spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific, \n\nMilan, Italy).  \n\nThe samples were then sent to BioFab (Rome, Italy) for sequencing, using the \n\nfollowing primers: 530f, 926f, 907r and 519r, Table 7.

Results and Discussion \n\n \n\n4.1 Isolation attempts using HSSL \u2013 based medium \n\n \n\nThe isolation of diverse PHAs-producing bacteria may help to identify novel and \n\nmore efficient PHAs producers, which may lead to better PHAs yield in a short period of \n\ntime, thus cutting down production costs (Chien et al. 2007). Therefore, aiming the \n\nisolation of microorganisms able to store PHAs from the different carbon sources present \n\nin HSSL, from a mixed microbial culture selected under feast and famine conditions, \n\nisolation attempts by platting in solid medium containing HSSL were performed.  \n\nDespite the wide variety of PHAs-accumulating bacteria in different environments, \n\nonly some reports have focused the potential for PHAs production of using resident \n\nbacterial species from activated sludge, which is generated in large quantities in biological \n\nwastewater treatment (Law et al. 2001; Reddy et al. 2008; Koller et al. 2011).  \n\nBiomass from the mixed microbial culture (MMC) previously selected under ADF \n\nconditions (Queir\u00f3s 2012) was spread in solid medium containing HSSL and some \n\ncolonies grew separately after 2 days. Five randomly chosen colonies were selected and \n\ncontinuously streaked onto solid medium in order to obtain pure cultures. The isolates were \n\nnamed as strains AF1 to AF5. The isolation of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from this \n\nsample of MMC had already been performed by Queir\u00f3s (2012). The author isolated a \n\nbacteria identified as Klebsiella spp. using a plating isolation technique in a defined \n\nmedium with xylose as carbon source.  \n\n \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n \n\n34 \n \n\n(A) \n\n \n\n(B) \n\n \n\nFigure 8: MMC plated in solid medium containing HSSL (A); isolated strain AF2 in pure culture, \n\nin solid medium containing HSSL (B). \n\n \n\n \n\nAfter several replating cycles, Gram and Nile Blue staining and FISH analysis were \n\nperformed in order to evaluate the purity of the isolates, as well as to determine their \n\nmorphology, PHAs-accumulating capability and elucidate on their taxonomy. The results \n\nare resumed in Table 8.  \n\nGram staining showed that AF1 and AF2 were Gram variable, as they appeared to \n\nbe Gram negative with Gram positive inclusions inside the cells, and the three remaining \n\nisolates were Gram negative. A higher number of Gram negative isolates was expected as \n\nit was the dominant morphotype on the MMC (Queir\u00f3s 2012). Gram staining also allowed \n\nfor the description of the morphology of the strains, which was confirmed by phase \n\ncontrast microscopic observation. Strains AF1 and AF2 had a bacillus morphology, which \n\nwas one of the main morphotype found on the MMC (Queir\u00f3s 2012) and AF3, AF4 and \n\nAF5 a coccobacilus morphology, also detected in the MMC (Queir\u00f3s 2012). \n\n  \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n \n\n35 \n \n\nIn order to verify the PHAs-accumulating abilities of the isolates, mineral base \n\nmedium with sodium acetate at a concentration of 0.5g.L\n-1\n\n was prepared and each one of \n\nthe isolates was inoculated. Nile Blue staining, which is a specific staining for PHAs \n\ninclusions, allowed the confirmation that the five isolates were PHAs-accumulating \n\nbacteria. The presence of inclusion bodies of PHAs was easily observed by the presence of \n\nbrilliant dots in the cells after Nile Blue staining procedure under epifluorescence \n\nmicroscopy. In the majority of cases the brilliant dots were replaced by the full \n\nfluorescence of the cells, which lead to believe that the cells stored a high amount of \n\nPHAs. \n\nFISH analysis was performed as a preliminary taxonomic analysis of the isolates. \n\nFrom the five probes used (EUB338mix, Alf968, Bet42a, Gam42a and Hcg69a) the five \n\nisolates gave a positive result for EUB338mix, and therefore belonged to Bacteria Domain \n\nand three were positive for Gam42a, belonging to Gammaproteobacteria. The remaining \n\ntwo isolates showed negative result for Alf968, Bet42a, Gam42a and Hcg69a. \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n \n\n36 \n \n\n \nMorphology Nile Blue Stain \n\n(Phase Contrast / Epifluorescence) \nSequencing \n\nMorphology Gram Stain \n\nAF1 Bacilli \n\nGram variable \n\n \n \n\nComplete Sequencing: 100% \n\nidentity with Rhodococcus \n\nspp. \n\nAF2 Bacilli \n\nGram variable \n\n \n \n\nPartial Sequencing: 100% \n\nidentity with Rhodococcus \n\nspp. \n\nTable 8: Pictures of Gram and Nile Blue staining of the five isolates and the results of sequencing. \n\n \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n \n\n37 \n \n\n.\n\nAF3 Coccobacilli \n\nGram(-) \n\n \n \n\nComplete Sequencing: 99% \n\nidentity with Pseudomonas \n\nspp. \n\nAF4 Coccobacilli \n\nGram(-) \n\n \n \n\nPartial Sequencing: 100% \n\nidentity with Pseudomonas \n\nspp. \n\nAF5 Coccobacilli \n\nGram(-) \n\n \n \n\nPartial Sequencing: 100% \n\nidentity with Pseudomonas \n\nspp. \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n \n\n38 \n \n\nNo bacteria belonging to Alphaproteobacteria, the dominant group present in the \n\nselected MMC (Queir\u00f3s 2012), or to Betaproteobacteria were isolated. Therefore, as an \n\nattempt to isolate bacteria belonging to the dominant group, an isolation approach on solid \n\nmedium containing acetic acid or xylose, as carbon source, was adopted. However, after \n\nobtaining three different isolates for each carbon source, FISH analysis was performed and \n\nthe six isolates gave a positive result for Gammaproteobacteria. Therefore, the taxonomic \n\naffiliation of the isolates obtained in this study is consistent with the identity of the one \n\nisolated previously (Queir\u00f3s 2012). They belonged either to Gammaproteobacteria or \n\nActinobacteria. This finding meant that the culturable fraction of the MMC belonged to \n\nthese two phylogenetic groups.  \n\nThe isolation of bacteria belonging to Gammaproteobacteria instead of those \n\nbelonging to the dominant classes has been previously observed (Gu et al. 2010). The \n\nisolation of nonylphenol ethoxylate-degrading bacteria from activated sludge had been \n\nassigned to Gammaproteobacteria, which was different from the results acquired using \n\nmolecular techniques. Therefore, the authors used a new bacterial isolation strategy, by the \n\nuse of gellan gum as a gelling reagent instead of agar. Gellan gum was used once it can \n\neffectively increase the cultivability of organisms and overcome some of the toxic effects \n\nthat agar has on various groups of microorganisms (Gu et al. 2010). In addition, the clarity \n\nof the gellan gum gels allows to detect micro-colonies in plates that could not be seen on \n\nagar (Gu et al. 2010). The authors were able to isolate strains belonging to seven different \n\ngenera including Sphingobium and Achromobacter, thus to Alphaproteobacteria and \n\nBetaproteobacteria classes (Gu et al. 2010). Future isolation attempts should be performed \n\nusing this isolation strategy to verify if it would be possible to isolate bacteria belonging to \n\nthe dominant group of the selected MMC. \n\n \n\n4.1.1 Identification of isolates \n\n \n\nThe partial 16S rRNA sequencing followed by basic local alignment search tool \n\n(BLAST) analysis was performed in order to have a preliminary identification of the \n\nisolates. It showed that the isolated strains AF1 and AF2 had 100% similarity with \n\nRhodococcus spp. and the remaining three, AF3, AF4 and AF5, had 100% similarity with \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n \n\n39 \n \n\nPseudomonas spp. Taking these results into consideration, the complete sequencing of one \n\nof the isolated stains belonging to Rhodococcus spp. (AF1) and one to Pseudomonas spp. \n\n(AF3) was performed. The complete sequencing of the 16S rRNA allowed the \n\nidentification of AF1 as Rhodococcus spp., which the preliminary affiliation was 100% to \n\nRhodococcus qingshengii strain djl-6 (Xu et al. 2007). AF3 was identified as Pseudomonas \n\nspp, which the preliminary affiliation was 99% to Pseudomonas libanensis strain CIP \n\n105460 (Dabboussi et al. 1999).  \n\nMembers of genus Rhodococcus (Actinobacteria class) are widely distributed in \n\nnatural environments, such as soils, water and marine sediments (Hernandez et al. 2008). \n\nThese bacteria are well known for possessing a variety of catabolic pathways which allow \n\nthem to degrade environmental pollutants and can be exploited to perform commercially \n\nuseful bioconversions (de Carvalho et al. 2005). Rhodococcus species have been isolated \n\nfrom activated sludge samples, in which the main objective was the degradation of \n\npollutants, such as estrogens and quinoline (Yoshimoto et al. 2004; Yu et al. 2007; Zhu et \n\nal. 2008). Moreover, degradation of phenolic compounds from Rhodococcus strains has \n\nalso been reported in the literature (Mart\u00ednkov\u00e1 et al. 2009; Paisio et al. 2012). \n\nLignosulphonates (LS) are the major component of HSSL, with a concentration around \n\n78g.L\n-1\n\n. LS include several phenolics, such as pyrogallol, syringic acid and gallic acid \n\n(Marques et al. 2009). Queir\u00f3s (2012) reported consumption of LS during the PHAs \n\nproduction process. Therefore, it is possible that the Rhodococcus strains present in the \n\nMMC were one of the genera responsible for the consumption of these phenolics. \n\nAdditionally, these microorganisms developed metabolic strategies to cope with these \n\nenvironments where nutrient limitation is common. One of these mechanisms may be the \n\naccumulation of storage compounds, such as PHAs, that can be utilized by cells as \n\nendogenous carbon sources and electron donors during periods of nutritional scarcity \n\n(Hernandez et al. 2008). A few members of this genus were described as PHAs-\n\naccumulators. Rhodococcus ruber NCIMB 40126 and Rhodococcus sp. ATCC 19070 were \n\nreported to accumulate PHAs copolymers containing 3HV units from a range of unrelated \n\ncarbon sources, such as glucose and fructose (Haywood et al. 1991). Using glucose as \n\ncarbon source a PHAs content of 14 and 21% of cell dry weight was achieved, respectively \n\nfor each strain and using fructose the PHAs content was of 11 and 14% (Haywood et al. \n\n1991). Rhodococcus aetherivorans IAR1 isolated from soil demonstrated ability to \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n \n\n40 \n \n\nproduce 18 % cell dry weight of P(3HB-co-3HV) from toluene (Hori et al. 2009). Lastly, \n\nR.jostii RHA1 when cultivated with different carbon sources showed higher content of \n\ncopolymer with gluconate (7.6% cell dry weight) (Hernandez et al. 2008). \n\nThe genus Pseudomonas belongs to class Gammaproteobacteria, family \n\nPseudomonadaceae and includes a great variety of microorganisms that are ubiquitous in \n\nnature being found in water and soil, being characterized by an enormous biosynthetic \n\ncapacity and versatility (Nitschke et al. 2011). Numerous Pseudomonas spp. strains were \n\nalso reported as phenol-degrading bacteria (Agarry et al. 2008). Several Pseudomonas \n\nPHAs-producing strains have been isolated from diverse environments. P. stutzeri isolated \n\nfrom oil contaminated soil produced PHAs when grown on both soybean oil and glucose \n\nmineral media, producing PHAs up to 63 and 52% of cell dry weight, respectively (He et \n\nal. 1998).P. extremaustralis sp. 14-3\nT\n isolated from a temporary pond in Antarctica was \n\nable to accumulate P(3HB) when octanoate was used as carbon source (L\u00f3pez et al. 2009). \n\nPseudomonas species have been mainly described as mcl-PHAs producers. However, a \n\nsludge isolated P.aeruginosa MTCC 7925 demonstrated good capacity to synthesize scl-\n\nlcl-PHAs copolymers from unrelated carbon sources containing scl-HAs (3HB and 3HV) \n\nand lcl-HAs of C16 (3HHD) and C18 (3HOD) units as the constituents (Singh et al. 2008). \n\nIn activated sludge samples, the isolation and study of PHAs production of Pseudomonas \n\nspp strains was performed in some studies (Tsz-Chun et al. 2005; Porwal et al. 2008; \n\nReddy et al. 2008; Kourmentza et al. 2009; Venkateswar Reddy et al. 2012a; Venkateswar \n\nReddy et al. 2012b). Reddy et al. (2008) performed the isolation of PHAs producers from \n\nmunicipal sewage sludge, including activated sludge samples, and identified three \n\nPseudomonas strains (Reddy et al. 2008). Porwal (2008) isolated 35 bacterial strains from \n\ndiverse environmental sources, including activated sludge, and the activated sludge \n\nsamples yielded 17 isolates, two of them identified as P. stutzeri, able to produce P(3HB) \n\nand hydrogen (Porwal et al. 2008). Considering studies of PHAs production by mixed \n\ncultures enriched under periodic feeding conditions in a SBR starting from activated \n\nsludge, the identification of Pseudomonas species as PHAs producers has also been \n\nperformed (Dionisi et al. 2006; Lee et al. 2011). Lee et al. (2011) using nonanoic acid as \n\nsubstrate, identified P.aeruginosa as the dominant strain of the microbial community \n\nresorting to DGGE analysis and also performed the isolation of two strains, in which the \n\n16S rDNA sequences revealed that they were closely related to P.aeruginosa. In the future, \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n \n\n41 \n \n\nfurther studies should include the design and validation of specific FISH probes for these \n\ntwo strains, in order to confirm their presence in the initial selected MMC.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2 Kinetic tests with isolates AF1 and AF3 \n\n \n\nAfter the isolation on agar growth medium, the isolated strains AF1 \u2013 Rhodococcus \n\nspp. and AF3 \u2013 Pseudomonas spp., were inoculated in liquid medium, consisting of \n\nmineral base containing HSSL or acetic acid or xylose. After the adaptation to the liquid \n\nmedium, kinetic tests were performed, in order to characterize the two cultures. In Figures \n\n9 and 10 are represented the growth and substrate consumption, in the three media, for the \n\nisolated strain AF1and strain AF3, respectively. Kinetic tests were performed in triplicated. \n\nTherefore, the determinations regarding biomass (optical density and VSS) were \n\nperformed in triplicate. However, COD was quantified for only one of the triplicates, due \n\nto technical limitations. The results of the kinetic parameters obtained are summarized in \n\nTable 9.  \n\n \n\nTable 9: Results obtained from the kinetic tests.  \n\nIsolate Carbon Source \u00b5max (h\n-1\n\n) td (h) \nqs  \n\n(gS.gX\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n) \n\nY(X/S) \n(gX.gS\n\n-1\n) \n\nAF1 HSSL 0.212 \u00b1 0.0219 3.29 \u00b1 0.344 0.466 0.454 \n\n \nAcetic Acid 0.153 \u00b1 0.0252 4.61 \u00b1 0.800 0.519 0.295 \n\n \nXylose 0.188 \u00b1 0.0238 3.73 \u00b1 0.504 0.572 0.329 \n\n      \nAF3 HSSL 0.251 \u00b1 0.0526 2.84 \u00b1 0.543 0.336 0.747 \n\n \nAcetic Acid 0.194 \u00b1 0.0147 3.58 \u00b1 0.263 0.430 0.451 \n\n  Xylose 0.130 \u00b1 0.00578 5.34 \u00b1 0.239 0.264 0.492 \n\n \n\n4.2.1 Isolated strain AF1 \u2013 Rhodococcus spp.  \n\n \n\nThe strain AF1 \u2013 Rhodococcus spp. showed high affinity with two media, the one \n\nwith HSSL and with xylose, since it began to grow right after inoculation, and the lag \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n \n\n42 \n \n\nphase was undetectable. With acetic acid as sole carbon source, the strain presented a lag \n\nphase around two hours. As observed in Figure 9, a higher biomass concentration, of \n\n0.510\u00b10.0966gVSS.L\n-1\n\n, was obtained in the assay using HSSL. This value is six times \n\nhigher than the biomass concentration obtained using xylose as sole carbon source, \n\n0.0867\u00b10.0538gVSS.L\n-1\n\n, and seventeen times higher than using acetic acid, \n\n0.0308\u00b10.00247gVSS.L\n-1\n\n. One reason for these differences observed on biomass amount \n\nmay be the lower concentration of substrate in two  media with acetic acid and xylose, \n\nsince the amount of carbon sources were determined in order to be approximately the same \n\nas the amount in which both carbon sources were present in the media with HSSL. \n\nHowever, as shown in Figure 9, this cannot be the only explanation, because xylose and \n\nacetic acid were still present at the end of the kinetic tests, acetic acid at much lower \n\nconcentration 0.0467 g COD.L\n-1\n\n than xylose 0.124 g COD.L\n-1\n\n, and cells were already in \n\ndeath phase. A possible explanation may be the lack of other components present in HSSL \n\nthat are needed for microbial growth. \n\nWhen grown in liquid medium with HSSL, the isolated strain AF1 presented a \n\nmaximum specific growth rate (\u00b5max) of 0.212\u00b10.0219 h\n-1\n\n corresponding to duplication \n\ntime of 3.29\u00b10.344 h. This \u00b5max was the highest showed by this strain. With acetic acid as \n\nsole carbon source AF1 presented a \u00b5max of 0.153\u00b10.0252h\n-1\n\n corresponding to duplication \n\ntime of 4.61\u00b10.800h and in xylose a \u00b5max of 0.188\u00b10.0238h\n-1\n\n corresponding to duplication \n\ntime of 3.73\u00b1 0.504h. The growth and PHAs accumulation of Rhodococcus strains using \n\nacetate as carbon source as been reported, but the authors only report the PHAs \n\naccumulation content and monomers composition, not giving information towards the \n\nkinetic parameters of growth (Haywood et al. 1991; Hori et al. 2009). However, the effects \n\nof acetate concentrations on cell growth of a Rhodococcus strain, R. rhodochrous was \n\npreviously shown (Honda et al. 1998). It was reported that cell growth was significantly \n\ninhibited at concentrations above 3g.L\n-1\n\n and below 2.5 g.L\n-1\n\n the specific growth rate was in \n\na range of 0.15 to 0.16 h\n-1\n\n (Honda et al. 1998), which goes according to our results. A very \n\ninteresting finding was the fact that this strain was able to metabolize xylose, since there \n\nare no reports of utilization of this sugar from wild-type strains belonging to genus \n\nRhodococcus (Hori et al. 2009; Xiong et al. 2012).  \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n \n\n43 \n \n\n(A) \n\n \n \n\n(B)  \n\n \n \n\n(C) \n\n \n \n\nFigure 9: Microbial growth evolution, in gVSS.L\n-1\n\n, and substrate consumption, in gCOD.L\n-1\n\n, along \n\nthe kinetic tests performed with the isolated strain AF1- Rhodococcus spp., in three different \n\nmedium, each with a distinct carbon source: HSSL (C), acetic acid (B) and xylose (C).  \n\n1.00\n\n1.50\n\n2.00\n\n2.50\n\n3.00\n\n3.50\n\n0.000\n\n0.100\n\n0.200\n\n0.300\n\n0.400\n\n0.500\n\n0.600\n\n0.700\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nC\nO\n\nD\n (\n\ng\n.L\n\n-1\n) \n\nV\nS\n\nS\n (\n\ng\n.L\n\n-1\n) \n\nTime (h) \n\nVSS (g/L) COD (g/L)\n\n0.000\n0.020\n0.040\n0.060\n0.080\n0.100\n0.120\n0.140\n0.160\n0.180\n\n0.000\n\n0.005\n\n0.010\n\n0.015\n\n0.020\n\n0.025\n\n0.030\n\n0.035\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nC\nO\n\nD\n (\n\ng\n.L\n\n-1\n) \n\nV\nS\n\nS\n (\n\ng\n.L\n\n-1\n) \n\nTime (h) \n\nVSS COD\n\n0.100\n\n0.150\n\n0.200\n\n0.250\n\n0.300\n\n0.350\n\n0.400\n\n0.000\n\n0.020\n\n0.040\n\n0.060\n\n0.080\n\n0.100\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nC\nO\n\nD\n (\n\ng\n.L\n\n-1\n) \n\nV\nS\n\nS\n (\n\ng\n.L\n\n-1\n) \n\nTime (h) \n\nVSS COD\n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n \n\n44 \n \n\n \n\n4.2.2 Isolated strain AF3 \u2013 Pseudomonas spp.  \n\n \n\nThe isolated strain AF3, identified as Pseudomonas spp., showed a very similar \n\nbehavior as strain AF1. Both strain grew in the three media and resulted in higher biomass \n\nconcentrations when grown in HSSL. However, the concentrations obtained were lower. In \n\nHSSL the biomass concentration obtained, of 0.174 \u00b1 0.0297gVSS.L\n-1\n\n, was three times \n\nlower than for AF1 in the same medium. The biomass concentration achieved in HSSL \n\nwas about three times higher than in the essays using acetic acid or xylose as sole carbon \n\nsources, which were respectively 0.0536\u00b10.0121 gVSS.L\n-1\n\n and 0.0642\u00b10.0124 gVSS.L\n-1\n\n. \n\nMoreover, as can be observed in Table 9, the results showed the preference of both strains \n\nfor growing in medium with HSSL, through the higher \u00b5max in the essays with HSSL, \n\n0.212\u00b10.0219h\n-1\n\n and 0.251\u00b10.0526h\n-1\n\n, presented by strains AF1 and AF3 respectively, as \n\nwell as the biomass yield from substrate (Y(X/S)), which were 0.454 gX.gS\n-1 \n\nand 0.747 \n\ngX.gS\n-1\n\n, respectively. On the other hand, strain AF1 \u2013 Rhodococcus spp. showed a \n\npreference in consuming xylose and AF3 \u2013 Pseudomonas spp. for acetic acid, as they \n\npresented a higher specific substrate consumption rate (qs) of 0.572gCOD.gVSS\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n and \n\n0.430gCOD.gVSS\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n, respectively, compared to those with the two other substrates. The \n\ngrowth and PHAs production has been previously reported for Hydrogenophaga \n\npseudoflava, formerly called Pseudomonas pseudoflava, from the sugars present in \n\nhydrolysates from the hemicellulosic fraction of hardwood, as a carbon and energy source \n\n(Bertrand et al. 1990). In this study, the results obtained for xylose were similar to those of \n\nBertrand et al (1990) in which H. pseudoflava, showed a \u00b5max of 0.130 h\n-1\n\n in the production \n\nof the copolymer from xylose. \n\nThe quantification of the components of HSSL along the time in the essays using \n\nHSSL is necessary in order to have a better understanding of the growth and consumption \n\nbehavior of both strains using the by-product and should be performed in future studies. \n\nQueir\u00f3s (2012) performed kinetic batch tests with the selected MMC and determined the \n\nkinetic parameters. In the study of the kinetics of PHAs production from HSSL \n\ncomponents a \u00b5max of 0.143 h\n-1 \n\nwas obtained (Queir\u00f3s 2012), which was lower than the \n\nobtained by the two isolated strains in this study. The same behavior was observed using \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n \n\n45 \n \n\nacetate or xylose as sole carbon sources, where the author obtained a \u00b5max of 0.090 h\n-1 \n\nand \n\n0.119 h\n-1\n\n, respectively. The difference of behaviors concerning the two latter carbon \n\nsources may be partly explained due to the fact that the isolated strains AF1 and AF2 were \n\nfirst adapted to the liquid mediums before performing the kinetics tests, and in the case of \n\nthe MMC the inoculum was directly removed from the SBR and inoculated into the new \n\nmedium. Regarding the consumption of xylose, in the screening study performed by Lopes \n\net al. (2009), the isolates showed a specific growth rate (\u00b5max) range of 0.15\u20130.62 h\n-1\n\nusing \n\nxylose as carbon source (Lopes et al. 2009). The results of this study are included in this \n\nrange. Finally, taking into account that strains belonging to both isolated genera were \n\npreviously reported as phenol-degrading bacteria (Agarry et al. 2008; Mart\u00ednkov\u00e1 et al. \n\n2009; Paisio et al. 2012), in further studies, the possibility of both strains in consuming LS \n\nshould be evaluated, through the quantification of LS on the growth curves in HSSL. \n\nIn PHAs production with the selected MMC from HSSL, acetic acid was \n\ncompletely consumed and some xylose remained in the medium (Queir\u00f3s 2012). This \n\nallows for the use of the effluent of the PHAs production process to be use used as \n\nsubstrate for other biological processes that use this pentose as carbon source, allowing the \n\nintegration of another production process, under the Biorefinery concept. If the same \n\nbehavior was verified in the production process using the isolates, for example, knowing \n\nthat acetic acid acts as an inhibitor of many biological processes, its consumption would \n\nallow the subsequent utilization of the effluent for bioethanol production from xylose by \n\nScheffersonmycesstipiti stipitis (Pereira et al. 2012). \n\n  \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n \n\n46 \n \n\n(A) \n\n \n \n\n(B) \n\n \n \n\n(C) \n\n \nFigure 10: Microbial growth evolution, in gVSS.L\n\n-1\n, and substrate consumption, in gCOD.L\n\n-1\n, \n\nalong the kinetic tests performed with the isolated strain AF3- Pseudomonas spp., in three different \n\nmedium, each with a distinct carbon source: HSSL (A), acetic acid (B) and xylose (C).   \n\n2.000\n\n2.200\n\n2.400\n\n2.600\n\n2.800\n\n3.000\n\n0.000\n\n0.050\n\n0.100\n\n0.150\n\n0.200\n\n0.250\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nC\nO\n\nD\n (\n\ng\n.L\n\n-1\n) \n\nV\nS\n\nS\n (\n\ng\n.L\n\n-1\n) \n\nTime (h) \n\nVSS (g/L) COD (g/L)\n\n0.000\n0.020\n0.040\n0.060\n0.080\n0.100\n0.120\n0.140\n0.160\n0.180\n\n0.000\n\n0.010\n\n0.020\n\n0.030\n\n0.040\n\n0.050\n\n0.060\n\n0.070\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nC\nO\n\nD\n (\n\ng\n.L\n\n-1\n) \n\nV\nS\n\nS\n (\n\ng\n.L\n\n-1\n) \n\nTime (h) \n\nVSS (g/L) S (gCOD/L)\n\n0.100\n\n0.150\n\n0.200\n\n0.250\n\n0.300\n\n0.350\n\n0.400\n\n0.000\n\n0.020\n\n0.040\n\n0.060\n\n0.080\n\n0.100\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nC\nO\n\nD\n (\n\ng\n.L\n\n-1\n) \n\nV\nS\n\nS\n (\n\ng\n.L\n\n-1\n) \n\nTime (h) \n\nVSS (g/L) S (gCOD/L)\n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n \n\n47 \n \n\n \n\n4.2.2.1 PHAs accumulation \n\n \n\nA qualitative evaluation of the PHAs-accumulating capability of both strains, AF1 \n\n\u2013 Rhodococcus spp. and AF3 \u2013 Pseudomonas spp., in liquid medium with the three \n\ndifferent carbon sources analyzed (HSSL, acetic acid and xylose) was performed. Samples \n\ntaken during the kinetics tests were observed under phase contrast and after Nile Blue \n\nstaining. The results, as images of microscopic observation of AF1- Rhodococcus spp. and \n\nAF3 \u2013 Pseudomonas spp., are shown in Table 10 and Table 11, respectively. It was \n\npossible to observe that PHAs accumulation in bacterial cells increased along the \n\nincubation period reaching a maximum at the late exponential stage of the growth curve \n\nwhich corresponds to 9hours in Table 10 and Table 11. This PHAs accumulation behavior \n\nhas been previously observed in other studies (Reddy et al. 2008; Queir\u00f3s 2012).For both \n\nstrains, in HSSL and xylose assays it was possible to clearly observe the PHAs inclusions \n\ninside cells. In acetic acid assay, cells were completely fluorescent, which meant that they \n\nwere completely full of PHAs. The latter finding is somehow expected when acetic acid \n\nwas the substrate, since it is a VFA that is more easily and rapidly consumed by \n\nmicroorganisms and accumulated as PHAs(Gumel et al. 2012). As the PHAs accumulation \n\nincreased and reached the maximum PHAs content, some cells were completely \n\nfluorescent in the three tests. Nevertheless, the fluorescence intensity was always higher \n\nwhen acetic acid was the carbon source supplied. In addition, in the assays of PHAs \n\nproduction with HSSL, a higher intensity of fluorescence was clearly observed for strain \n\nAF1 than for strain AF3, indicating a higher content of PHAs produced by the former. \n\nThe quantification of PHAs accumulated and analysis of the monomers in each \n\nmedia should be determine in order to confirm that the inclusions correspond to PHAs and \n\nevaluate which polymer was accumulated, once both strains were reported in previous \n\nstudies has having capacity to accumulate the copolymer P(3HB-co-3HV). Another \n\nconsideration is the fact that it has been reported that some strains belonging to genus \n\nRhodococcus accumulate triacylglycerols (TAGs). Moreover, the strains Rhodococcus \n\nruber NCIMB 40126 and Rhodococcus opacus PD630 showed capability to accumulate \n\nboth storage compounds simultaneously (PHAs and TAGs) (Alvarez et al. 2000; \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n \n\n48 \n \n\nHern\u00e1ndez et al. 2010). Nile Blue stain is specific for PHAs, not staining glycogen and \n\npolyphosphate, however can stain lipid bodies, therefore increasing the need to quantify \n\nand analyze samples using Gas Cromatography (GC). However due to some technical \n\nproblems, that was not possible. \n\nLower PHAs yields have been previously obtained for pure cultures using \n\nhemicellulosic hydrolysates. This may be due to presence of residual toxins or inhibitors \n\nand and/or limitation of biologically available xylose monosaccharides in the fermentation \n\nmedium (Keenan et al. 2006). Consequently, reinforcing the need to quantify PHAs along \n\ntime and also evaluate the PHAs-accumulating capability of the isolates increasing the \n\nconcentration of HSSL in the medium. It is important to note that in this study, PHAs \n\nproductivity obtained was expected to be lower compared to other studies using pure \n\ncultures due to minor biomass and substrate concentrations in the system and the \n\nuncontrolled cultivation conditions, of pH and oxygen (Yan et al. 2008). Concentrations of \n\nbiomass and substrate used in commercial production are significantly higher. For \n\nexample, the cell concentration of Alcaligenes latus was 76 g.L\n-1\n\n and 5-20g.L\n-1\n\n of sucrose \n\nresulted in a productivity of 4.94 gPHB.L\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n (Wang et al. 1997). \n\nAn ideal organism for PHAs production would be a culture that could store high \n\nPHAs contents and grow rapidly on an inexpensive substrate (Yan et al. 2008). Several \n\nstudies have shown that it was possible and potentially economical to develop PHAs \n\nproduction systems using activated sludge to isolate the PHAs-accumulating bacteria for \n\nPHAs production, and this study reinforces this. From both strains, AF1-Rhodococcus \n\nshowed great potential for PHAs production from HSSL, due to its higher biomass \n\nconcentration, \u00b5max and fluorescence intensity after Nile Blue staining. Further studies are \n\nneeded in order to characterize the polymers produced and to optimize the growth and \n\nPHAs accumulation.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n \n\n49 \n \n\nTable 10: Images of Phase Contrast and Nile Blue staining of samples of AF1-Rhodococcus spp., taken at different times of growth in liquid medium \n\nwith three different carbon sources (HSSL, acetic acid and xylose) \n\nSubstrate \n\nNile Blue Staining \n\n(Phase Contrast / Epifluorescence Microscopy) \n\n t=0h t=6h t=9h t=25h \n\nHSSL \n\n    \n\n t=0h t=2h t=9h t=25h \n\nAcetic \n\nAcid \n\n    \n\n t=0h t=4h t=9h t=25h \n\nXylose \n\n    \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n \n\n50 \n \n\nTable 11: Images of Phase Contrast and Nile Blue staining of samples of AF3-Pseudomonas spp., taken at different times of growth in liquid medium \n\nwith three different carbon sources (HSSL, acetic acid and xylose). \n\nSubstrate \n\nNile Blue Staining \n\n(Phase Contrast / Epifluorescence Microscopy) \n\n t=0h t=2h t=9h t=25h \n\nHSSL \n\n    \n\n t=0h t=6h t=9h t=25h \n\nAcetic \n\nAcid \n\n    \n\n t=0h t=3h t=9h t=25h \n\nXylose \n\n    \n\n \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n \n\n51 \n \n\n4.3 16S rDNA clone library \n\n \n\nIn order to identify some of the main bacteria responsible for PHAs accumulation of \n\nthe MMC, a 16S rDNA clone library was constructed on DNA extracted from the selected \n\nMMC.

A total of 31 clones were obtained \n\nand 26 successfully identified.

Alphaproteobacteria was the dominant group of the \n\nMMC, accounting with 72.7 \u00b1 4.0 %, followed by Betaproteobacteria, 11.1 \u00b1 0.37 % and \n\nGammaproteobacteria, 10.3 \u00b1 0.3 %. A minor presence of Deltaproteobacteria, \n\nActinobacteria and Bacteroides was also detected (Queir\u00f3s 2012). The presence of \n\nPseudomonas spp. in the MMC had already been verified, through its isolation in solid \n\nmedium containing HHSL, as reported above. The presence of Firmicutes was not \n\nexpected, once they had not been identified in the MMC through the FISH analysis \n\n(Queir\u00f3s 2012). However, it is possible that they were present at a low amount and so \n\nundetectable.  \n\nIt is important to notice that for Novosphingobium spp., Sphingobium spp. and \n\nPedobacter spp., the identity values obtained in the BLAST analysis were relatively low. \n\nHowever, only for the two first microorganisms it is possible to say that these may be new \n\nstrains, once the sequences of the microorganisms with highest identity are complete ones. \n\nRegarding the remaining strains, no conclusion may be established as only the partial \n\nsequencing was performed.  \n\nAs can be observed in Table 13, species belonging to all the genera obtained from \n\nthe clone library were previously identified or isolated from activated sludge samples, \n\nincluding Pseudomonas spp., which was discussed previously. They have been mostly \n\nbeen studied for their ability to grow in contaminated environments and to degrade those \n\nsame contaminants. Only strains belonging to Clostridium spp., Comamonas spp., \n\nNovosphingobium spp., Pleomorphomonas spp. and Sphingobium spp. have been reported \n\nas PHAs-accumulating bacteria (Emeruwa et al. 1973; Thakor et al. 2005; Xie et al. 2005; \n\nAddison et al. 2007; Liang et al. 2010; Zakaria et al. 2010; Teeka et al. 2012). \n\n  \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n \n\n53 \n \n\nAchromobacter spp. have been reported to be common microorganisms that use \n\nmultiple organic pollutants in different environmental conditions (He et al. 2013). The \n\nability of degrading several pollutants, such as pyridine, endosulfan, \n\nnonylphenolethoxylate and di-n-butyl phthalate, has been studied, including strains \n\nisolated from activated sludge (Li et al. 2009; Gu et al. 2010; Deng et al. 2011; He et al. \n\n2013). This genus has been previously identified in selected activated sludge in an ADF \n\nreactor for PHAs accumulation. Dionisi et al. (2006) identified Achromobacter sp. after the \n\nconstruction of a clone library, however did not verify PHAs-producing capability (Dionisi \n\net al. 2006). So, it is possible to conclude that this genus belongs to a fraction of the MMC \n\nthat does not produce PHAs. In the same study, Comamonas sp. was also identified \n\n(Dionisi et al. 2006). However, the genus Comamonas has been evaluated for PHAs \n\nproduction. For example, Comamonas testosteroni showed ability to store mcl-PHAs when \n\ncultivated on vegetable oils (Thakor et al. 2005). More recently, Comamonas sp. EB172 \n\nwas studied for its capability to produced PHAs from various carbon sources, including \n\nacetic acid (Zakaria et al. 2010).  \n\nClostridium species have been mostly isolated from moderate environments but not \n\nonly. Clostridium estertheticum DSM 14864 was isolated from a microbial mat located in \n\nthe moated periphery of a perennial frozen lake (Spring et al. 2003). Its presence in \n\nactivated sludge has also been detected (Mangayil et al. 2012). There are very few studies \n\nconcerning the PHAs-accumulating capability of Clostridium species, however it is known \n\nthat Clostridium botulinum accumulates P(3HB) during the growth phase and utilizes it as \n\nan energy source for sporulation (Emeruwa et al. 1973). \n\nThree genera belonging to Alphaproteobacteria were identified, Novosphingobium, \n\nSphingobium and Pleomorphomonas. The genus Novosphingobium includes a diverse \n\ngroup of bacteria displaying a number of unique traits that enable them to inhabit a variety \n\nof soil, sediment and aquatic environments (Addison et al. 2007). This genus was created \n\nto reclassify some species of the genus Sphingomonas by Takeuchi et al. (2001), in which \n\nthe genus Sphingomonas was devided into four genera: Sphingomonas sensu stricto, \n\nSphingobium, Novosphingobium and Sphingopyxis (Takeuchi et al. 2001). \n\nNovosphingobium nitrogenifigens Y88\nT\n was the first species belonging to this genus \n\nreported as PHAs-accumulator. This strain was isolated from pulp and paper-mill of \n\nwastewaters undergoing biological treatment in a bioreactor operated under nitrogen-\n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n \n\n54 \n \n\nlimited conditions (Addison et al. 2007) and is capable to accumulate a high content of \n\nPHAs, over 80% of its biomass, as P(3HB), when grown on glucose (Smit et al. 2012). The \n\ngenus Sphingobium is closely related to Novosphingobium. The strain Sphingobium \n\nscionense WP01\nT\n was isolated from a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) \n\ncontaminated soil (Liang et al. 2010). This strains was able to produce PHAs, as P(3HB), \n\naccumulating up to 24.1% cell dry weight from glucose.

Probe Sph120 \n\nwas used, which is specific for the order Shingomonadales. Before FISH analysis, the \n\nspecificity of the probe was studied using mathFISH tool (Yilmaz et al. 2011). Results are \n\nsummarized in Table 15. It was possible to verify that Sph120 was not the best probe to be \n\nused in the case of Novosphingobium spp. despite the high value displayed for \n\nhybridization efficiency (0.9999) as it presented one mismatch very close to the middle of \n\nthe probe sequence, and therefore decreasing the possibility of hybridization. Considering \n\nSphingobium spp. it showed perfect alignment and high hybridization efficiency (0.8962). \n\nHowever, the FISH analysis showed only few cells with positive result with the \n\nSph120 probe. Consequently, the cells to which the probe hybridized must be the \n\nSphingobium spp. present in the MMC. This allows concluding that Sphingobium spp. \n\nwere not the dominant PHAs-accumulating bacteria present in the MMC.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 11: Overlap of FISH pictures. Green cells were only hybridized by EubMix probe and the \n\nred cells represent the cells hybridized by EubMix and Sph120 probes. Blue cells represent the \n\nremaining biomass that was not hybridized.  \n\n \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n \n\n58 \n \n\n \n\nFurther studies should consider the design and validation of probes specific for the \n\ngenus Novosphingobium, in order to evaluate the presence in the MMC, determine \n\nprecisely the abundance, and whether Novosphingobium spp. are the main responsibles for \n\nPHAs production in the MMC. In addition to this, the FISH analysis of the remaining \n\nidentified strains should be performed, including Pleomorphomonas spp., using both \n\nprobes available or through the design and validation of specific probes.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n \n\n59 \n \n\n5. Concluding remarks \n\n \n\nStarting from a MMC selected under feast and famine conditions for PHAs \n\nproduction from HSSL, a by-product of pulp and paper industry, strains belonging to four \n\nout of the 6 groups identified of the microbial community were isolated or identified. Five \n\nstrains were successfully isolated using an isolation approach using solid medium \n\ncontaining HSSL. Strains belonging to the dominant class of the MMC were identified, \n\nthrough the construction of a 16S rDNA clone library, constructed on DNA extracted from \n\nthe selected MMC.  \n\nThe five isolates obtained showed PHAs-accumulating capability. Two of the \n\nisolated strains were identified as Rhodococcus spp. with bacillus morphology. The \n\nremaining three had a coccobacillus morphology and were identified as Pseudomonas spp. \n\nThe growth in liquid medium with HSSL or with the main carbon sources in HSSL (xylose \n\nor acetic acid), for one strain from each genus, AF1 \u2013 Rhodococcus spp. and AF3 \u2013 \n\nPseudomonas spp., were further analyzed. Both strains grew and produced PHAs from \n\neach substrate, including AF1 \u2013 Rhodococcus spp. from xylose, which had not been \n\npreviously reported. AF1 and AF2 showed preference for HSSL, and showed higher \u00b5max, \n\nof 0.212\u00b10.0219 h\n-1\n\n and 0.251\u00b10.0526 h\n-1\n\n, respectively, and greater biomass \n\nconcentrations. Concerning the substrate consumption, AF1 showed a preference in \n\nconsuming xylose and AF3 for acetic acid, as they presented a higher specific substrate \n\nconsumption rate (qs) of 0.572gCOD.gVSS\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n and 0.430gCOD.gVSS\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n. Finally, from \n\nthe qualitative evaluation of PHAs accumulation resulted the increase of inclusions along \n\nincubation time and a higher accumulation when acetic acid was used as sole carbon \n\nsource.  \n\nBased on the information retrieved from the 16S rDNA clone library, \n\nNovosphingobium spp., Sphingobium spp. and Pleomorphomonas spp., belonging to the \n\ndominant class of the MMC, Alphaproteobacteria were highlighted. Furthermore, \n\nAchromobacter spp., Clostridium spp., Comamonas spp., Methylobacillus spp., Pedobacter \n\nspp. and Pseudomonas spp. were identified.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n60 \n \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n \n\n61 \n \n\n6. Future Prospects \n\n \n\nIn future works alternative isolation procedures need to be performed to isolate \n\nbacteria belonging to the dominant groups of the selected MMC. A possibility may \n\nconcern isolation attempts performed using gellan gum as a gelling reagent instead of agar. \n\nIn addition to this, specific FISH probes for all the strains identified by clone analysis, in \n\norder to confirm their presence in the initial selected MMC, should be designed and \n\nvalidated. The possibility of both the isolated strains, Rhodococcus spp. and Pseudomonas \n\nspp., in consuming LS should be evaluated, through the quantification of LS on the growth \n\ncurves in HSSL. Finally, the quantification of PHAs accumulated and analysis of \n\nmonomers composition in each media and determination of the properties of the polymers. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n62 \n \n\n\n\nIsolation and characterization of PHAs-accumulating bacteria from HSSL \n\n \n\n63 \n \n\n7.
