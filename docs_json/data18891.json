A disponibilidade global e a boa resolu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndos dados do sat\u00e9lite GOCE, aliadas \u00e0 disponibilidade de dados de gravimetria terrestre, \n\ns\u00e3o ideais para a compara\u00e7\u00e3o e classifica\u00e7\u00e3o das bacias de larga escala, como as bacias \n\nsedimentares do Solim\u00f5es e do Amazonas dentro do Craton amaz\u00f4nico. Foram \n\nprocessados um conjunto de dados, produtos GOCE EGG_TRF_2 Level 2, ao longo das \n\ntrajet\u00f3rias do sat\u00e9lite para remover o ru\u00eddo (shift/drift) nos gradientes da gravidade a \n\npartir da t\u00e9cnica crossover (XO).  \n\nCalculamos a redu\u00e7\u00e3o das massas topogr\u00e1fica a fim de obter os componentes do \n\ngradiente da gravidade  e anomalia da gravidade usando modelagem direta com prismas \n\nesf\u00e9ricos a partir do modelo de eleva\u00e7\u00e3o digital, ETOPO1. Desta maneira, a compara\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndos dados somente do sat\u00e9lite GOCE com as redu\u00e7\u00f5es das massas topogr\u00e1ficas referentes \n\naos componentes do gradiente da gravidade permitiram estimar quantidades invariantes \n\nque trouxeram uma melhoria na interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o dos dados do tensor de gravidade.  Al\u00e9m \n\ndisso, comparamos dados terrestres do campo de gravidade com dados do campo de \n\n\n\nvi \n\n \n\ngravidade dos modelos geopotenciais EGM2008 e GOCE, uma vez que os dados \n\nterrestres podem ser afetados por erros em longos comprimentos de onda devido a erros \n\nde nivelamento, diferentes referenciais de altitudes, e aos problemas em interligar \n\ndiferentes campanhas de medidas da gravidade.  \n\nPortanto, estimamos uma melhora e uma nova representa\u00e7\u00e3o dos mapas das \n\nanomalias de gravidade e do tensor gradiente da gravidade nas \u00e1reas inacess\u00edveis do \n\nCraton Amaz\u00f4nico. As observa\u00e7\u00f5es forneceram novas entradas para determinar campos \n\nregionais a partir dados brutos pre-processados (gradiente de gravidade EGG_TRF_2 \n\nL2), bem como a partir de um modelo geopotencial mais recente at\u00e9 grau e ordem 250 \n\ndos harmonicos esf\u00e9ricos derivados de dados somente do sat\u00e9lite GOCE para a \n\nrepresenta\u00e7\u00e3o do campo de gravidade como ge\u00f3ide, anomalias da gravidade e os \n\ncomponentes tensor da gravidade, os quais foram quantidades importantes para \n\ninterpreta\u00e7\u00e3o, modelagem e estudo dessas estruturas. \n\nFinalmente, obtivemos um modelo isost\u00e1tico considerando a estrutura de \n\ndensidade litosf\u00e9rica estudada atrav\u00e9s de uma modelagem direta 3D da distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\ndensidade por prismas esf\u00e9ricos usando a geometria do embasamento e descontinuidade \n\ndo Moho. Al\u00e9m do que, constatamos atrav\u00e9s da modelagem direta das soleiras de \n\ndiab\u00e1sios dentro dos sedimentos mostramos que somente as soleiras dentro da Bacia do \n\nAmazonas n\u00e3o s\u00e3o as \u00fanicas respons\u00e1veis pela anomalia de gravidade positiva que \n\ncoincide aproximadamente com as espessuras m\u00e1ximas dos sedimentos da Bacia. Talvez, \n\nisso possa ser tamb\u00e9m um resultado de movimentos relativos do Escudo das Guianas \n\nsituado ao norte da Bacia, e o Escudo Brasileiro situado ao sul. Embora isso seja apenas \n\numa evid\u00eancia adicional preliminar, n\u00e3o podemos confirm\u00e1-las a partir das estimativas do \n\ncampo da gravidade. Portanto, \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio outros tipos de dados geof\u00edsicos, como por \n\nexemplo, evid\u00eancias mais claras advindas do paleomagnetismo. \n\n  \n\n\n\nvii \n\n \n\nRIASSUNTO \n\n \n\nL'utilizzo dei dati della missione GOCE per caratterizzare ed \n\ndeterminare la Struttura di Densit\u00e0 dei Bacini Sedimentari di Amazon e \n\nSolim\u00f5es in Brasile \n\nEverton Bomfim, Ph.D \n\nL\u2019Universit\u00e0 di Sao Paulo e L\u2019Universit\u00e0 Degli Studi di Trieste, S\u00e3o Paulo, 2012 \n\n \n\nSupervisori: Eder Molina (USP) \n\n     Carla Braitenberg (UNITS) \n\n \n\nIl modo pi\u00f9 diretto per rilevare le variazioni di densit\u00e0 \u00e8 lo studio del campo \n\npotenziale di gravit\u00e0 e delle sue derivate. La disponibilit\u00e0 globale e buona risoluzione dei \n\ndati della missione satellitare GOCE, unitamente alla disponibilit\u00e0 dei dati gravimetrici \n\nterrestri sono l'ideale per intraprendere la comparazione e classificazione dei due grandi \n\nbacini sedimentari Amazon e Solim\u00f5es nell\u2019area del cratone amazzonico. Il set di dati \n\nGOCE ottenuti dalle tracce satellitari sono stati elaborati dal prodotti GOCE \n\nEGG_TRF_2 Level 2 generati con la correzione necessaria per rimuovere il rumore \n\nGOCE (spostamento/deriva) e cos\u00ec, noi abbiamo anche processato (da rimuovere la \n\ntendenza lineare)  per recuperare i singoli componenti del tensore gradiente di gravit\u00e0 \n\nusando la tecnica crossover (XO). \n\nSono state calcolate le riduzioni delle masse topografiche al fine di rilevare i \n\ncomponenti del tensore gradiente e le anomalie di gravit\u00e0 (componente verticale) usando \n\nla modellazione dai tesseroidi col Modello di Elevazione digitale, ETOPO1. Di \n\nconseguenza, la comparazione dei dati satellitari GOCE con le riduzione delle masse \n\ntopografiche per i componenti gradienti ha permesso di stimare le quantit\u00e0 invariate per \n\n\n\nviii \n\n \n\nun miglioramento dell\u2019interpretazione dei dati dei tensori di gravit\u00e0. Inoltre, abbiamo \n\ncomparato il campo di gravit\u00e0 dei dati terresti con modellazione gravimetrica del modello \n\nEGM2008 e del modello gravimetrico fornito da GOCE, in quanto i campi terrestri \n\npotrebbero essere colpiti da errori nelle lunghezze d\u2019onda grandi, dovuto a errori di \n\nlivellamento, dei diversi sistemi di riferimento impiegati nelle campagne dei diversi paese \n\ne quindi la difficolt\u00e0 nel collegamento ed omogeneat\u00e0 dei dati delle diverse campagne di \n\nmisurazione. \n\nTuttavia, \u00e8 stato riscontrato un miglioramento, e le nuove rappresentazioni nelle \n\nmappe sulle anomalie di gravit\u00e0 (Bouguer e free-air) e i componenti dei tensori gradienti \n\ndi gravit\u00e0 principalmente in aree inaccessibili, come ad esempio il cratone amazzonico. \n\nLe osservazioni GOCE forniscono nuovi indizi per determinare i campi regionali dai dati \n\ngrezzi (gradienti di gravit\u00e0 EGG_TRF_2 L2 ). Inoltre, \u00e8 stato usato il pi\u00f9 recente modello \n\ngravimetrico globale disponibile fino al grado e all\u2019ordine 250, sviluppato dalle \n\narmoniche sferiche, derived solo dai dati del satellite GOCE per rappresentare il campo di \n\ngravit\u00e0 con le anomalie gravimetriche. Anche, sono stati presi in considerazione il geoide \n\ne le componenti del tensore gradiente, che sono quantit\u00e0 importanti per la modellazione e \n\nlo studio di queste strutture. \n\nInfine, abbiamo ottenuto il modello isostatico considerando la struttura di densit\u00e0 \n\ndella litosfera, studiata attraverso una modellazione 3D diretta della distribuzione di \n\ndensit\u00e0, usando la geometria del basamento e la discontinuit\u00e0 Moho, conosciuti come \n\nvincolo iniziale. Inoltre, abbiamo trovato attraverso la modellazione diretta con davanzali \n\ne sedimenti ha dimostrato che le soglie diabase non sono le sole responsabili per le \n\nanomalie gravimetriche positive che tagliano il Bacino Amazzonico, grosso modo \n\ncoincidente con lo spessore massimo delle rocce sedimentarie o con il solco del bacino. \n\nCi\u00f2 potrebbe essere il risultato dei movimenti dello scudo della Guiana, situato a nord del \n\nBacino Amazzonico, e lo scudo brasiliano, situato a sud. Sebbene questa sia solo una \n\nprova preliminare, ci\u00f2 non pu\u00f2 essere confermato solo dai dati di gravit\u00e0. Infatti, sono \n\nnecessari altri tipi di dati geofisici, ad esempio, evidenze pi\u00f9 chiare ottenute dal \n\npaleomagnetismo. \n\n  \n\n\n\nix \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\n \n\nThe use of the GOCE Mission Data for Characterizations of and \n\nImplications on the Density Structure of the Sedimentary Basins of \n\nAmazon and Solim\u00f5es \n\nEverton Bomfim, Ph.D \n\nThe University of Sao Paulo and the University of Trieste, S\u00e3o Paulo, 2012 \n\n  \n\n Supervisors: Eder Molina (USP)  \n\n     Carla Braitenberg (UNITS) \n\n \n\nThe most direct way to detect density anomalies is the study of the gravity \n\npotential field and its derivatives. The global availability and good resolution of the \n\nGOCE mission coupled with the availability of terrestrial gravity data are ideal for the \n\nscope of intercomparison and classification of the two large-scale Amazon and Solimoes \n\nsedimentary basins into area of the Amazon Craton. The GOCE data set obtained in \n\nsatellite tracks were processed from EGG_TRF_2 Level 2 Products generated with the \n\ncorrection needed to remove the noise (shift/drift), and so, to recover the individual \n\ncomponents of the gravity gradient tensor using the crossover (XO) points technique.  \n\nWe calculated the topographic masses reductions in order to obtain the gravity \n\ngradient components and gravity anomaly (vertical component) using forward modelling \n\nfrom tesseroids from Digital Elevation Model, ETOPO1. Thus, the comparison of the \n\nonly-satellite GOCE data with the reductions of the topographic masses for the gradient \n\ncomponents allowed to estimate invariants quantities for bring an improvement in the \n\ninterpretation of the gravity tensor data. Furthermore, we compared the terrestrial data \n\ngravity field with EGM2008 and GOCE-deduced gravity field because the terrestrial \n\n\n\nx \n\n \n\nfields may be affected by errors at long wavelengths due to errors in leveling, different \n\nheight references, and problems in connecting different measurement campaigns.  \n\nHowever, we have estimated an improvement and new representations of the \n\ngravity anomalies maps and gravity gradient tensor components primary in inaccessible \n\nareas of the Amazon Craton. GOCE observations provide new inputs to determine the \n\nregional fields from the preprocessed raw data (EGG_TRF_2 L2 gravity gradients), as \n\nwell from the most recent global geopotential model available up to degree and order 250 \n\ndeveloped in spherical harmonics derived only-satellite GOCE data for representing of \n\ngeoid and others gravity field as gravity anomaly and gravity gradient tensor components, \n\nwhich are important quantities for modelling and studying these structures. \n\nFinally, we obtained the isostatic model considering the lithospheric density \n\nstructure studied through a 3D direct modelling of density distribution using the geometry \n\nof basement and Moho discontinuity, assumed to be known as initial constraint. In \n\naddition, we found through direct modeling sills and sediment has shown that the diabase \n\nsills are not the only ones responsible for positive gravity anomaly map that transects the \n\nAmazon Basin, roughly coincident with the maximum thickness of sedimentary rocks or \n\nthe trough of the basin. Maybe, this could be the result of the relative movements of the \n\nGuiana Shield, situated at the north of the Amazon basin, and the Brazilian Shield, \n\nsituated at the south. Although this is only a preliminary additional evidence, we cannot \n\nconfirm it only from the data of gravity. It is necessary others types of geophysical data, \n\nfor example, more clear evidences obtained from paleomagnetism. \n\n  \n\n\n\nxi \n\n \n\nDECLARATION \n\nI certify that, to the best of my knowledge, my thesis does not infringe upon \n\nanyone\u2019s copyright nor violate any proprietary rights and that any ideas, techniques, \n\nquotations, or any other material from the work of other people included in my thesis, \n\npublished or otherwise, are fully acknowledged in accordance with the standard \n\nreferencing practices.

INTRODUCTION \n\nI.1. Background  \n\nIn some cases sedimentary basins appear to have an anomalous isostatic state if the classic \n\nisostatic hypothesis is considered, which assumes that the topographic and sedimentary loads are \n\nsustained by crustal thickening or thinning. In some cases, the high density of the material in the \n\nlower crust or upper mantle has been supposedly an important component in the formation of \n\nlarge scale sedimentary basins and in contributing to the isostatic equilibrium. Often, the high \n\ndensity anomalous mass can be related to phase changes in lower crust or upper mantle \n\nfollowing a heating event. \n\nNormally, the first phase in the formation of the large basins can be viewed from crustal or upper \n\nmantle loads leading to subsidence ages, presence of volcanism that last for several hundreds of \n\nmillion years and their classification according to the geoid, potential field and gravity anomalies \n\nprovide important constraints for determining the geological properties and history of the Earth. \n\nIn general, the gravity anomaly has been widely used in exploration geophysics due to \n\ntechnological restrictions and to the simplicity of its measurement and interpretation.  \n\nHistorically, the use of the second derivatives of the gravitational potential began to solve \n\ngeological problems in 1896 with the development of the Torsion Balance instrument by Baron \n\nLor\u00e1nd von E\u00f6tv\u00f6s, which quickly made the gravity gradiometry possible to oil prospectors \n\naround the world, becoming the predominant geophysical technique for exploration purposes. \n\nThe use of gravity gradiometry continues to grow, and consequently, its measurements have also \n\nincreased the resolution in the upper geologic section. The Earth\u2019s gravity field together with \n\nsatellite missions has contributed to determine and improve the understanding of the Earth's \n\ngravity field in the past decade. In the years 1960\u2019s and 1980\u2019s, geodetic satellites have provided \n\ninformation about medium and long-wavelength components in geopotential models of Earth\u2019s \n\ngravity field represented in spherical harmonics. Indeed, a variety of global geopotential models \n\nexpress the earth's gravity field and therefore the geoid height in terms of spherical harmonics \n\nand have been computed by various groups, for example, GPM98 A, B and C (Wenzel, 1998), \n\nEGM96 (Lemoine et al., 1998). Recently, the CHAMP (CHAllenging Minisatellite Payload) \n\nMission (Reigber et al., 2002) and the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) \n\nMission (Tapley et al., 2004), as well as its latest geopotential models, e.g. EGM2008 model \n\n\n\n \n\n \n2 \n\n(Pavlis et al., 2012), led to significant contributions with respect to knowledge about long \n\nwavelength and consequently long-wavelength geoid for providing global and high-resolution \n\nestimates of the Earth\u2019s gravity field and its temporal variations (Keller and Sharifi, 2005; \n\nKiamehr and Eshagh, 2008; Rummel et al., 2002; Yi et al., 2010).  \n\nFinally, the GOCE (Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer) Mission applies \n\nthe principle of Satellite Gravity Gradiometry (SGG) that is being used in space with a tri-\n\ndimensional (3-D) gradiometer on board to measure the gravity gradient components of the \n\nEarth\u2019s gravity field, providing a new regional aspect for global geopotential models (ESA, \n\n1999; Keller and Sharifi, 2005; Rummel et al., 2002; Yi et al., 2010). \n\nThe most direct way to detect crustal density anomalies is the study of the earth gravity potential \n\nfield and its derivatives. Thus, the global availability and good resolution of the GOCE satellite \n\ngravity gradiometry mission, coupled with the availability of data from terrestrial gravity \n\nsurveys, are ideal for the scope of intercomparison and classification of the Amazon and \n\nSolim\u00f5es sedimentary basins, which in geological terms are very old and classified as \n\nintracratonic or Paleozoic basins in an area of almost 1,000,000 km\n2\n separated by the Purus \n\nArch. \n\nAlthough modern gravity measurements have recorded with great precision the Earth\u2019s gravity, \n\nthis field is known to not identify body\u2019s edges and to contain no directional information; this is \n\nthe reason why there is a large variety of inversion and interpretation methods using gravity \n\ngradients. The gravity gradients directly recover sharp signals over the edges of structures, where \n\nthe concept of gravity gradiometry is a 3D gravity and its anomalies reflect the edges and shapes \n\nof sources rather than just the mass distribution (Bell et al., 1997). Each individual information \n\nof the gravity tensor can be related to geological attributes (subsurface geology) and are used to \n\nlocate bodies or to map geological contact information (horizontal components: Txx, Txz, Txy, Tyy \n\nand Txz) whereas the vertical component (Tzz) provides additional constraint and information \n\nrelating to size, depth and isopachs of geological targets.  \n\nThe impact of working with these pieces of information of the gravity tensor can be significative \n\nas an \u2018engine\u2019 that facilitates to identify not only the geology of the target but also mapping its \n\ngeological configuration in any survey area in terms of shape, size and orientation of target \n\nstructures (Murphy and Dickinson, 2010).  \n\nThe use of invariant analysis with gravitational and magnetic gradients is one of the methods \n\nstudied by Pedersen and Rasmussen (1990) describing a procedure which combines all the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n3 \n\nhorizontal components of the tensor using the invariance to isolate the signature patterns \n\nemerging from the underlying geology to produce a series of lineament maps that indicate the \n\ndimensionality of the sources. \n\nHence, the lithospheric density structure can be studied through a 3D modelling of density \n\ndistribution using the geometry of basement and Moho discontinuity, assumed to be known as \n\ninitial constraint. Furthermore the Earth\u2019s gravity field in terms of geoid, gravity anomalies and \n\ngravity gradient tensor components can be studied to allow modelling and studying of these \n\nstructures. \n\nI.2. Modelling 3D: A Direct Problem \n\nSuppose that the shape of the earth and the density variations within it are exactly known. With \n\nthis information, a unique value of the actual potential, W, can be found. That is, the \n\ndetermination of the actual potential is a well-posed \"direct\" problem. Thus, due to its simplicity \n\nand its approximate expressions relating to gravitational potential, the use of rectangular prisms \n\nhas been target of interest in gravity modelling. Here, a three-dimensional density distribution \n\ncan be approximated with desired accuracy using the prisms. This can be represented with the \n\ndiscretization within the Earth in regular prisms which are associated with homogeneous density \n\ncontrast values for the calculation of the potential gravitational and gravity gradients \n\nindependently of the other neighbor prism of different density. \n\n The formulation of Nagy et al. (2000) gives the field of the rectangular prism, which limits the \n\napplicability over large areas because it implies an approximation of the flat earth, but even so it \n\nis a good alternative for describing the density distribution and especially useful in studies for \n\ngravitational potential modelling.  \n\nThe gravitational potential and its derivatives of a spherical prism in spherical coordinates, being \n\ndefined as tesseroid, was obtained by Heck &amp; Seitz (2007). This geometry provides the formulas \n\nfor the topographic?isostatic reduction of the vertical deflections to reveal the advantage using \n\ntesseroids instead of prism due to its better approximation of the spherical earth. However, the \n\nrepresentation of the Earth in spherical tesseroids only can be computed numerically because no \n\napproximated form yet has been found to solve the triple integral analytically due to the \n\noccurrences of elliptic integrals. Thus, Heck &amp; Seitz (2007) suggested to use an approximated \n\nintegral solution that reduces to a surface integral by numerical integration with respect to the \n\nradial coordinate. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n4 \n\nAlthough the use of gravity gradients data in hydrocarbon and mineral exploration is more \n\ncommon, nevertheless interpretation of these data is not as easy as standard gravity data. There is \n\na study (Saad, 2006) showing that for a given source, regardless of its simplicity, gravity \n\ngradients produce a complex pattern of anomalies compared to the simple single-amplitude \n\ngravity anomalies. The gravity gradients are maximum over the edges, corners and center of \n\nmass of the causative body, according to the component. This has been observed differently by \n\nBell et al. (1997), showing that integration of gravity gradiometry measurements into standard \n\ngravity (vertical component) significantly changes the power spectrum slope, indicating \n\nimproved resolution of small features by the gradients. The steepness of the power spectrum \n\nobtained by gradiometry can reflect enhanced curve suggesting that gravity gradients \n\nsignificantly improve the capability of gravity to constrain the location of structures. In contrast \n\nto the flattening of the standard gravity curve indicating a limitation of resolution to constrain the \n\nanomalous masses using only the traditional gravimetric proceeding.  \n\nI.3. Problem Statement \n\nThis research is part of a greater project that has as the goal to use the GOCE products of the \n\ngravity potential to study large scale basins of the South American continent (Amazon, \n\nSolim\u00f5es, Parna\u00edba, Paran\u00e1), the Tarim Basin and the Michigan Basin for intercomparison, \n\nwhich will allow to classify the basins according to their potential field signal. The project is one \n\nof the GOCE user projects, with ID: 4323, entitled: \u201cImplications on the density structure below \n\nlarge scale basins from GOCE observations. \n\nIn this work, in the first phase a digital database of constraining data was constructed, which \n\nextended over the study area and included basement depth, sediment densities, sediment depth \n\nvariation, Moho depth, lithospheric thickness (where available). Then the estimation of \n\nanomalies and derivatives generated by variations in topography and thickness of sediment and \n\ncrust/mantle variations was done, as well as the mapping of the observed gravity anomalies and \n\nother terrestrial data available. Phase one is a feasibility study to SGG (Satellite Gravity \n\nGradiometry) of GOCE to investigate the gravity field signal in Amazon and Solim\u00f5es \n\nsedimentary basins. Phase two involves a comparison of the GOCE products data, gravity \n\npotential and its derivatives, with the available terrestrial gravity data. The final phase involves \n\nresidual fields in order to determine crustal and upper mantle density anomalies.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n5 \n\nI.4. Feasibility \n\nFirst and foremost, the definition of feasibility within the scope of this study follows also a part \n\nof the Science Goals of the GOCE Mission (e.g. Table 4.1 of GOCE Level 2 Product Data \n\nHandbook) (Gruber, et al., 2009). Particularly, this research is constrained to a greater project \n\ndescribed above and which has as principal-investigator my adviser in University of Trieste, \n\nCarla Braitenberg, who is also the promotor of the International Academic Agreement For Co-\n\nSupervision and Double Diploma between the University of S\u00e3o Paulo (Dept. of Geophysical), \n\nBrazil, and the University of Trieste (Dept. of Earth Sciences), Italy, making my PhD thesis \n\nfeasible in this frame. \n\nThe gravity field and gradient tensor data have been observed in the GOCE mission and I use the \n\ngeopotential models GOCE and EGM2008. \n\nThis study concerns understanding the density anomalies on Paleozoic Amazon and Solim\u00f5es \n\nBasins on the Amazon Craton that cover enormous, partly inaccessible areas; only partially \n\nterrestrial gravity data, irregularly distributed, are available, wherefore high-resolution global \n\nsatellite gravity gradiometry data produced by GOCE are essential for fulfilling this research. \n\nI use other data available from open literature, as sediment thickness and Moho depth. \n\nI compare the terrestrial data gravity field with EGM2008 and GOCE-deduced gravity field \n\nbecause the terrestrial fields may be affected by errors at long wavelengths due to errors in \n\nleveling, different height references, and problems in connecting different measurement \n\ncampaigns. In inaccessible areas the GOCE observations provide new inputs to determine the \n\nregional fields (See APPENDIX A). \n\nThe GOCE data will improve the representation of the regional field, which is also one of the \n\nmain objectives of the mission. \n\nInnovation: A systematic screening of the gravity potential field and its derivatives as well as a \n\nstudy of the gravity field for these intra-cratonic sedimentary basins has not been made before, \n\nalthough the partial screening of geologic properties and gravity modelling are available in \n\nMilani &amp; Zal\u00e1n (1999), Tassinari and Macambira (1999) and Nunn &amp; Aires (1988), respectively. \n\nIndeed, these types of basins have in common the fact that the Moho discontinuity is not shallow \n\nin correspondence to basin, which implies that the mass deficit in the basin could be \n\ncompensated by high density in the crustal or upper mantle levels. Hypothetically, this fact could \n\nbe essential to the formation of these types of basins and could be related to an eclogite phase \n\nchange. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n6 \n\nContribution: The proposed research contributes to the improvement of the understanding of the \n\nsolid Earth processes, in particular to the subject Lithosphere and upper mantle structure \n\nunderlying sedimentary basins here studied by Satellite Gravity Gradiometry GOCE \n\nmeasurements. \n\nI.5. Research Objectives \n\nThe objective of this research is to use the GOCE Level 2 products of the gravity potential and \n\nits derivatives to improve the understanding of Amazon and Solim\u00f5es sedimentary basins also \n\nknown as cratonic or intracratonic basins and which bear important natural hydrocarbon \n\nresources in Brazil. \n\nOf particular interest in the gravity anomaly map is the chain of gravity highs that transects the \n\nAmazon Basin, roughly coincident with the maximum thickness of sedimentary rocks or the \n\ntrough of the basin. This can be primarily due to the presumed downward deflection of the \n\ncrust/mantle boundary beneath the basin. \n\nI.6. Study Area \n\nThis study is concentrated in the gravity observations of the Paleozoic Basins in Amazon Craton, \n\nBrazil: the Solim\u00f5es and Amazon Sedimentary intracratonic basins are situated -10\u00ba ? ? ? 5\u00ba in \n\nlatitude and -75\u00ba ? ? ? -45\u00ba in longitude and are discussed in the next chapters. \n\nI.7. Preview structure \n\nThis thesis is divided into eight chapters. The Chapters I through V are dedicated to highlights, \n\nstatements, understanding and objectives of the problem setup, literature review with history of \n\ngravity gradiometry, the history of gravity satellite missions and global geopotential models for \n\nthe gravity field, methodologies and methods required to collect and enhance data used in this \n\nresearch. Among the five subsequent chapters, the Chapter II gives a brief geological description \n\nof the study area. Chapter III summarizes briefly basic gravity field principles, the methods and \n\ntools as satellite gradiometry, terrestrial gravity observations and a representation of the \n\nGeopotential Gravity Model (GGM) in spherical harmonics, a short review of previous gravity \n\n(geodetic) satellite missions and global geopotential models, as well as methodology for forward \n\nmodelling and topographic reduction. Chapter IV encompasses the history of gravity \n\ngradiometry and a review of the satellite gravity gradiometer GOCE technology. Furthermore, a \n\nstudy was done on the modelling of gravity gradients based on the formulas of Nagy et al. (2000) \n\n(prism models) and Heck and Seitz (2007) (tesseroid models) . \n\n\n\n \n\n \n7 \n\nChapter V covers the processing of the GOCE Level 2 Products data, EGG_TRF_2, which \n\nrequires the extraction and preparation of additional corrections needed in order to remove the \n\nGOCE GGs noise (shift/drift) on XO points due to different orbit heights. \n\nIn the chapter VI the calculation of the topographic masses reductions is obtained for gravity \n\ngradient components and gravity anomaly (vertical component) using tesseroids from Digital \n\nElevation Model (DEM) such as ETOPO1. Chapter VII also provides the results, analysis and \n\ndiscussion of the gravity field serving to report the findings from the feasibility study. \n\nFurthermore, the Chapter VII provides other data found in the study area as basement depth, \n\nsediment densities, sediment depth variation, Moho depth. Estimation of anomalies and \n\nderivatives generated by variations in topography and thickness of sediment and crust/mantle \n\nthickness and mapping of the gravity anomalies and other available terrestrial data. Also how \n\ngravity gradient maps were constructed from GOCE and geopotential models in order to \n\ndetermine resolution and precision. Finally, the Chapter VIII is a closing discussion that will \n\nconclude the thesis with significant contributions and insights. Also, a summary of the research \n\nand possible challenges and future work recommendations will be discussed. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n8 \n\nCHAPTER II \n\nII. LITERATURE REVIEW: AN OUTLINE OF THE \n\nGEOLOGY IN AMAZON AND SOLIM\u00d5ES BASIN \n\nIt is essential to understand the driving mechanism, when considering the evolution and \n\nsubsidence history of the basins as well as the age from geochronology, which provides the \n\nduration and magnitude of independent subsidence episodes. The relative subsidence due to \n\nthermal contraction following a heating event continues, whether or not the basin is exposed to a \n\neustatic lowering of sea level suggesting that sequences of sediments between craton-wide \n\nunconformities reflect separate mechanical episodes of subsidence. However, these reasonable \n\neustatic sea level changes could cause the main unconformities observed in rapidly subsiding \n\nplatform basins according to Nunn and Aires (1988). \n\nAs such, we have Paleozoic sedimentation preserved when referring to the remnants of signifi-\n\ncant, mostly undisturbed basins. The large Brazilian basins (Figure II-1), for instance Solim\u00f5es, \n\nAmazonas, Parna\u00edba and Paran\u00e1, are named after large rivers that flow along their major axes.  \n\nIn particular, the present study is localized on the Amazon and Solim\u00f5es Basins that follow a E-\n\nW trend overlying the Amazonian Craton (AC) which is considered as one of the largest cratonic \n\nareas in the world between exposures of two large Precambrian shields, Guiana Shield to the \n\nnorth and the Brazilian Shield to the south. It is located in the northern part of South America \n\ncovering about 440,000 km\n2\n surrounded to the east by the Neoproterozoic Tocantins province, in \n\nwhich the active orogenic systems Araguaia and Paraguay mobile belts generated during the \n\nBrasiliano Orogenic Cycle. The AC is concealed beneath the Phanerozoic coverage of several \n\nbasins as to the Northeast (Maranh\u00e3o), South (Xingu and Alto Tapaj\u00f3s), Southwest (Parecis), \n\nWest (Solim\u00f5es), North (Takutu) and in its center (Amazon basin) (Matos and Brown 1992; \n\nMilani and Zal\u00e1n 1999; Bizzi et al. 2004; Cordani et al. 2009).  \n\nII.1. Introduction \n\nThe Solim\u00f5es and Amazon Basins comprise an area of almost 1,000,000 km\n2\n, and were formed \n\noverlying the central part of the region, starting in the Lower Paleozoic. These structures show \n\nmany tectonic and magmatic features always related to major tectonic events occurring at their \n\nmargins. To the North and West, the Andean belt was the source of the stresses responsible for \n\nsome important tectonic reactivations, mainly related to compressional or transpressional \n\n\n\n \n\n \n9 \n\nstresses. To the north-east, extensional features are the result of the opening of the North \n\nAtlantic, starting at about 200 Ma. \n\nDue to the paleomagnetic and geologic evidences that have been described in Tohver et al. \n\n(2006), Cordani et al. (2009) and Bipo-Santos et al. (2012), there is practically no doubt about \n\nthe existence of the Pangea at the end of Paleozoic, and also about the position of the different \n\ncratonic nuclei within the Amazonian Craton, as suggested by Cordani and Teixeira (2007).  \n\n \n\nFigure II-1: Main Brazilian Phanerozoic interior sedimentary basins and the study area \u2013 the Solim\u00f5es \n\nand Amazon Basins. Data: CPRM (after Bizzi et al., 2004). \n\nThe tectonic units in the AC compose a large crustal province known as the South American \n\nplatform, and, in association with the Andean belt and the adjacent sub-andean flats, they \n\n\n\n \n\n \n10 \n\nconstitute the bulk of the South American continent and remained tectonically stable in \n\nPhanerozoic times (Milani and Zal\u00e1n 1999; Bizzi et al. 2004; Cordani et al. 2009). \n\nII.2. Geochronological Provinces of the Amazonian Craton \n\nThe isotopic studies and the definition of geochronological provinces are useful for providing a \n\nbasis for the understanding of the crustal evolution processes and their tectonic implications on a \n\ncontinental scale. Here the geochronological pattern of the AC will be summarized, attempting to \n\ndescribe the isotopic and geological data to understand the geological evolutionary history, based \n\non the works of Amaral (1974); Cordani et al. (1979); Teixeira et al. (1989); Tassinari et al. \n\n(1996); Tassinari (1996); Santos et al. (2000); and Bizzi et al. (2004).  \n\nThe suggested tectonic evolution controlled by crustal episodes of accretions partially follow the \n\nprinciples of Stockweel (1968) obtained in the Canadian Shield study, based on the occurrences \n\nof the geological similarity between this unit and other cratonic regions in the world. For \n\nexample, Africa and Australia, are major zones within cratonic areas, where a characteristic \n\ngeochronological pattern predominates, and the age determinations obtained by different isotopic \n\nmethodologies for different geological units characterizes the divisions mainly on the basis of the \n\nages of the metamorphic basement and the geological characteristics. However, these provinces \n\nmay include one or more orogenic episodes within their respective time-periods, considering \n\norogeny as a period of metamorphic episodes accompanied by deformation, partial melting and \n\nsyntectonic granitic intrusions, and not as the broader concept of a complete orogenic cycle, \n\ninvolving subsidence, deposition of sediments, metamorphism, syn- and post-tectonic magmatic \n\nactivities and anorogenic episodes. Thus, the provinces mainly differ from each other in the ages \n\nof metamorphic terranes and their geological history (Tassinari and Macambira, 1999; Coutinho, \n\n2008).  \n\nAccording to Tassinari and Macambira (1999), the geographical boundaries between \n\ngeochronological provinces in the AC have been reasonably well-defined mainly according to \n\nthe geochronological and the geophysical-structural models, although some limits are still not \n\nwell characterized due to the overprint of age determinations and/or lack of reliable geological \n\ninformation. Therefore some boundaries already defined were questioned regarding the precise \n\nlocation of the geochronological boundaries observed in the field that are increasingly being \n\nestablished from detailed geological studies since Amaral (1974), passing through Cordani et al. \n\n(1979), Teixeira et al. (1989), Tassinari et al. (1996), Tassinari and Macambira (1999), Tassinari \n\net al. (2000), Santos et al. (2000), Bizzi et al. (2004), Cordani and Teixeira (2007) and Cordani et \n\nal. (2009).  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n11 \n\nBased on the radiometric data from the Precambrian rocks of the Brazilian Amazon, predominantly Rb-Sr analysis, different authors proposed an \n\nevolutionary model for the Amazonian Craton.  \n\nTable II-1: Evolution of the main interpretions of subdivisions in the Amazonian Craton (modified from Bizzi et al., 2004). \n\nAmaral \n\n(1974) \n\nCordani et \n\nal.

(1989), Tassinari et al. (1996), Tassinari et al. (2000), Santos et al. (2000), \n\nCordani and Teixeira (2007). The CPRM (Geological Service of Brazil) has developed a broad \n\ngeochronological program in the Amazon region, focusing on Sm-Nd and U-Pb SHRIMP analysis. \n\nPart of the results of this program, together with contemporaneous works mainly at the Federal \n\nUniversity of Par\u00e1, were incorporated in the work described in Bizzi et al. (2004), which allowed \n\nsome changes and promoted important improvements in the model of Santos et al. (2000). \n\nThese geochronological evolution models can be resumed in Table II-1 with a short synthesis of the \n\nmain geologic features, and to some extent the related geochronological control, for the Archean \n\nand Proterozoic tectonic units of the AC. Figure II-2 shows the model adopted in Bizzi et al. (2004), \n\npresented by Santos et al. (2000), who reinterpreted the previously defined AC provinces based on \n\nU-Pb and Sm-Nd data contained on several regional maps produced by CPRM. \n\nMajor advances have occurred in the period of 2000 to 2002 in the geochronological evolution \n\nmodel presented by Bizzi et al. (2004) and Cordani and Teixeira (2007), that can be summarized in \n\nTable II-1 and Figure II-3. \n\nAccording to Bizzi et al., (2004), there are seven AC geological provinces of distinct ages, \n\nevolution, and structural patterns, namely (Figure II-3): (i) Caraj\u00e1s, with two domains \u2013 Rio Maria \n\n(Mesoarchean) and Caraj\u00e1s (Neoarchean); (ii) Central Amaz\u00f4nia (Archean-Paleoproterozoic), with \n\nthe Iriri-Xingu and Curu\u00e1-Mapuera domains; (iii) Trans-Amazonian (Rhyacian), with the Amap\u00e1 \n\nand Bacaj\u00e1 domains; (iv) Tapaj\u00f3s\u2013Parima (Orosirian), with the Peixoto de Azevedo, Tapaj\u00f3s, \n\nUaimiri and Parima domains; (v) Rond\u00f4nia\u2013Juruena (Statherian), with the Jamari, Juruena and \n\nJauru domains; (vi) Rio Negro (Statherian), with the Rio Negro and Imeri domains; and (vii) Suns\u00e1s \n\n(Meso-Neoproterozoic), with the Santa Helena and Nova Brasil\u00e2ndia domains. Despite the \n\ndeficiency of U-Pb and Sm-Nd data over large areas it is possible to state that each of the Provinces \n\nwas generated by a succession of orogenies. Some of the Provinces, such as the Trans-Amazonian \n\n(2.26\u20132.01 Ga) and Tapaj\u00f3s-Parima (2.03\u20131.87 Ga) Provinces, are composed by four distinctive \n\norogenies; while the Suns\u00e1s Province (1.45\u20131.10 Ga) was generated by three orogenies (Santa \n\nHelena, Candeias and Nova Brasil\u00e2ndia). \n\nAccording Coutinho (2008), the almost total absence of terrestrial access, the presence of extensive \n\nvegetation cover, the absence of an appropriate scale geologic maps, the absence of profiles in \n\nairborne geophysical surveys with spacing of less than 1 km and the lack of a geochronological \n\nsupport enabling the understanding of the geological-tectonic evolution of the region are the causes \n\n\n\n \n\n \n13 \n\nthat makes the AC remains in one of the lowest levels in the Archaean geological knowledge, \n\nespecially in the part comprised by the Brazilian territory, despite of the existence of minerals \n\nresources (iron, gold), oil and gas, in the region. \n\n \n\nFigure II-2: Evolution of models for interpretation of the Amazon Craton. Models:1 \u2013 Amaral \n\n(1974); 2 \u2013 Cordani et al. (1979); 3 \u2013 Teixeira et al (1989); 4 \u2013 Tassinari (1996); 5 \u2013 Santos et al. \n\n(2000) modified of Bizzi et al. (2004). \n\nHence over the time these tectonic provinces have been modified with increasing amount of \n\ngeochronological, geological and geophysical data. Recent works brought new insights in the \n\ngeochronological boundaries of the Amazonian Craton and its tectonic provinces, leaded by \n\nCordani and Teixeira (2007) and corroborated by Cordani et al. (2009), who has subdivided the tec- \n\n\n\n \n\n \n14 \n\n \n\nFigure II-3: Amazonian Craton Provinces modified from CPRM data (after Bizzi et al., 2004) \n\ndraped over ETOPO1 digital elevation model, Amante and Eakins (2008). \n\ntonic provinces modified from Cordani et al. (2000) into two Archean cores and five accretionary \n\nPaleoproterozoic belts (provinces) (Figure II-4). Two small ancient nuclei of the Central-\n\nAmazonian Province (with ages > 2600 Ma) consisted of the large Caraj\u00e1s granite\u2013greenstone \n\nterrain, and the Xingu\u2013Iricoum\u00e9 block, where the extensive Paleoproterozoic cratonic covers of the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n15 \n\nRoraima Supergroup occurs, overlying gneissic and granitoid rocks. Established Archean crust is \n\nrestricted to the Caraj\u00e1s region, located at southeast of the Amazon basin, whose rocks yielded \n\nradiometric ages between 2600 and 3200 Ma (Cordani et al. 2009). Proterozoic tectonic provinces \n\nwith radiometric ages in the interval about 2250\u20132050 Ma (Maroni-Itacaiunas), 1980\u20131810 Ma \n\n(Ventuari-Tapaj\u00f3s), 1780\u20131550 Ma (Rio Negro-Juruena), 1550\u20131300 Ma (Rondonian-San Ignacio) \n\nand 1280\u2013950 Ma (Suns\u00e1s) are described in these works. \n\n \n\nFigure II-4: Tectonic framework of South America with emphasis on the Amazonian Craton and its \n\ntectonic provinces in the northeastern Brazilian region the Borborema province (B) predominates; \n\nthe Tocantins province (T) is present in the Central Brazil region, which includes the Goi\u00e1s \n\nMagmatic Arc (GMA) and the Mantiqueira province (M) (extracted from Cordani and Teixeira, \n\n2007).  \n\nAs discussed in Milani and Zal\u00e1n (1999), it is interesting to notice that the basins had their \n\nsubsidence mechanisms reactivated during additional tectonic events, resulting in a pile of \n\nsedimentary and volcanic strata that can reach cumulative thickness of more than 7,000 m in the \n\nAmazon Basin. For instance, rifts are known below the Amazon, Solim\u00f5es and Parna\u00edba Paleozoic \n\nbasins, that have in their sediments about 240,000 km\n3\n of intruded diabase, mainly in the form of \n\n\n\n \n\n \n16 \n\nsills. Such igneous rocks are essentially constituted of plagioclase, pyroxene, quartz, biotite and \n\nhornblende, and were united under the named Penatecaua Episode (Wanderley Filho et al. 2006). \n\nHowever, older ages strata and even their restricted areal distribution, contradicted the hypothesis \n\nthat considers them as the direct predecessors of the overlying intracratonic sags (Milani and Zal\u00e1n \n\n1999), and several papers have been published as an attempt to understand the intrusion mechanism, \n\nthe age and the variation in the chemical composition of these sills, as well as their influence on the \n\noil generation. Francis (1982), for example, studied igneous features in North of England showing \n\nthat when the diabase is still fluid, it can migrate dip down, by gravity, in the direction to the \n\nstructural depocenter and if there is any lithological and/or structural change, it \"seeks the easier \n\nway\" to continue its flow towards the structural trough (Milani and Zal\u00e1n 1999; Wanderley Filho et \n\nal., 2006).  \n\nHence, as discussed in Milani and Zal\u00e1n (1999), there was an initial subsidence mechanism from a \n\nProterozoic crustal stretching associated with their formation or Early Paleozoic extensional \n\nreactivation of the Precambrian structural grain. Subsequent subsidence would have been achieved \n\neither by different episodes of reactivation by crustal stretching, always using the existing grain, or, \n\nin addition, by flexural mode due to the cratonward influence of distant, plate-margin collisional \n\ntectonics. \n\nAccording to Milani and Zal\u00e1n (1999) whatever have been the driving mechanisms of the \n\nsubsidence events, the depressions were filled with essentially siliciclastic sedimentary sections \n\nwith the notable exception of an evaporite-carbonate cycle in the Solim\u00f5es and Amazon basins, \n\ncorresponding to a large-scale Paleozoic transgressive-regressive cycles. The inital cycles usually \n\nshow marked glacial influences with Devonian age (Solim\u00f5es and Amazon) with respect to the \n\nlocation of the basin over the Gondwana supercontinent, that always wandered close to the South \n\nPole. In these basins the last transgressive-regressive cycle is almost uniformly terminated by late \n\nPermian to Triassic continental red beds that mark the drying out of the interior sags and the \n\ndefinitive disappearance of the seas from the cratonic areas of South America. The Mesozoic \n\nhistory of these basins is recorded as continental sedimentary packages and large volumes of \n\nmagmatic rocks. \n\nII.3. Solim\u00f5es Basin \n\nThe Solim\u00f5es Basin (Figure II-1) is situated in the northern Brazil, right in the heart of the Amazon \n\nforest and comprises an area of over 600,000 km\n2\n. Only two-thirds of this area corresponds to the \n\nregion of occurrence of Paleozoic strata (400,000 km\n2\n), the remainder being dominated by a sandy, \n\n\n\n \n\n \n17 \n\nCretaceous-to-Recent continental cover that prevents outcrops of the Paleozoic successions in the \n\nbasin. Its sedimentary fill ranges from the Ordovician to the Permian, grouped into three sequences. \n\nThe sedimentary environment of these rocks is in general marine, with brief intervals of continental \n\nsedimentation (Milani and Zal\u00e1n, 1999).  \n\nThis basin, together with its eastern counterpart, the Amazon Basin, constitutes an impressive E-W \n\noriented interior basin, 2,500 km long, 500 km wide and up to 5,000 m deep. The flexural arches of \n\nIquitos and Purus separate the Solim\u00f5es Basin from, respectively, to the west from the Acre Basin, \n\nwhich is interpreted as a retroarc foreland basin related to the Andean orogenesis, and the Amazon \n\nBasin to the east. Inside the Solim\u00f5es Basin, a prominent NW-SE-striking positive feature, the \n\nCarauari Arch, divides it internally in two sub-basins: to west and to east of the Carauari high, \n\nrespectively, the Jandiatuba and Juru\u00e1 sub-basins were placed beneath igneous and metamorphic \n\nrocks. Southwest of the Solim\u00f5es Basin, below the sub-basin Jandiatuba, is located the Eirunep\u00e9 \n\nsub-basin separated by Juta\u00ed Arch (Alves and Vaz 2006; Bizzi et al. 2004; Eiras 1996). \n\nParticularly during the pre-Pennsylvanian times, this structural high exerted a decisive control on \n\nthe sedimentary thickness distribution and facies. The easternmost Juru\u00e1 sub-basin has hydrocarbon \n\nreserves in the Paleozoic cratonic sequences with a package of sedimentary rocks up to 3,800 m \n\nthick and Proterozoic rifts (Bizzi et al. 2004). Its axis is marked by the presence of the Solim\u00f5es \n\nmega-shear zone, a classic example of an intraplate deformation belt that comprises a fault-and-fold \n\nsystem in a N70\u00b0 \u2013 80\u00b0E direction, with a total length of about 1,000 km, caused by Jurassic to \n\nCretaceous right-lateral wrenching constituting the main structural style of hydrocarbon traps in this \n\nbasin, as described by Milani and Zal\u00e1n (1999). \n\nIndeed, diabase sills and dykes occurred during late Triassic to early Jurassic ages, which played an \n\nimportant role in the hydrocarbon generation from the Devonian source rocks. The diabase sills can \n\noccur through hundreds of kilometers in this sedimentary basin. Its trajectory can be facilitated by \n\nfissile materials or diverted by lateral variations of facies and by faults. In cases where the intruded \n\nrocks are sandstones, they frequently jump abruptly, forming a variety of patterns. These rocks \n\nstrongly influence the exploratory activities in the basin. Diabase sills occur also over Purus Arch, \n\nalthough with minor expression, since the natural behavior of these bodies is to follow down dip the \n\nsedimentary beds (Wanderley Filho et al., 2006). \n\nThe stratigraphic structure of the Solim\u00f5es Basin is constituted of four Paleozoic supersequences \n\ncovered by two units, one of Cretaceous age and the other of Early Cenozoic to Recent ages, \n\npassing through the Ordovician, Silurian-Devonian and Devonian-Carboniferous Sequences. The \n\nPaleozoic sedimentary units were intruded by igneous rocks, which have a maximum thickness \n\n\n\n \n\n \n18 \n\ndrilled by the well in the Solim\u00f5es Basin of 1038 m, during the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic, an \n\nevent known as the Penatecaua magmatism (200 Ma). Such igneous rocks are essentially \n\nconstituted of plagioclase, pyroxene, quartz, biotite and hornblende, and they present a dominant \n\nsubof\u00edtic texture. Finally, as described in Milani and Zal\u00e1n (1999), a partial continentalization of the \n\nSolim\u00f5es Basin took place during the initial stages of the Carboniferous-Permian Sequence \n\nsediments, until it completely surpass the Purus arch linking the Solim\u00f5es and Amazon Basins into \n\na single depositional site (Milani and Zal\u00e1n 1999; Wanderley Filho et al. 2006). \n\nII.4. Amazon Basin \n\nThis basin may be classified as produced by extensional stresses and Interior Sag, caused by vertical \n\nmovements covering about 515,000 km\n2\n of the northern Brazilian region, lying completely under \n\nthe Amazon jungle (Figure II-1). Its main axis trends East-West and its sedimentary and intrusive \n\nrocks are between the two main Precambrian provinces, Guyanas shield and Central Brazil shield, \n\ncropping out along both sides of the northern and southern basins, respectively (Bizzi et al. 2004; \n\nMilani and Zal\u00e1n 1999; Nunn and Aires 1988).  \n\nThe basement of the Amazon Basin is dominantly constituted and filled by igneous (maximum \n\nthickness of 915 m drilled by a well in the Amazon Basin) and metamorphic rocks ranging from \n\nOrdovician to Cretaceous ages in marine to deltaic, alluvial, fluvial and lacustrine sedimentary \n\nenvironment in some Proterozoic rift successions occured in its western portion, composing the \n\nPurus Group. The northernmost basin of the province is the Tacutu Basin. To the east, the Amazon \n\nBasin is separated from the Mesozoic Maraj\u00f3 rift by the Gurup\u00e1 arch. To the west, the Amazon \n\nBasin is separated from the Solim\u00f5es Basin by the roughly N-S-trending Purus arch. In its \n\ndepocenter, the basin holds a stratigraphic record up to 5,000 meters thick including three Paleozoic \n\nsupersequences covered by Cretaceous to Recent continental clastics. The oldest Paleozoic age \n\nsedimentary rocks drilled in Amazon Basin are from the Middle Ordovician (Bizzi et al. 2004; \n\nMilani and Zal\u00e1n 1999; Nunn and Aires 1988; Wanderley Filho et al. 2006). \n\nThe existence of strong, positive gravity anomalies, coincident with the trough (major axis) of the \n\nAmazon Basin, suggested the presence of shallow ultrabasic bodies (Milani and Zal\u00e1n, 1999), later \n\nconfirmed with the observation of diabase sills and dikes as showed in seismic lines and wells \n\n(Wanderley Filho et al., 2006), together with the underlying aulacogenic strata. This led to the \n\nclassic interpretation of a rifting mechanism as the initial driving mechanism for the basin \n\nsubsidence although igneous activity can occur substantially before and/or after the continental \n\nrifting. As described in Nunn and Aires (1988), the rifting or intrusion of magmatic bodies beneath \n\nthe Amazon Basin is assumed to have occured in the Cambrian or the Early Ordovician age, as a \n\n\n\n \n\n \n19 \n\nlarge pyroxenite body beneath of the basin has been dated as Early Cambrian (565 + 70 Ma) using \n\nthe Nd/Sm method. \n\nAccording to Nunn and Aires (1988) the preliminary interpretation analysis of the tectonic \n\nsubsidence curves from deep wells in the basin indicated that the Ordovician/Silurian and \n\nDevonian/early Carboniferous sequences are consistent with thermal subsidence following rifting or \n\nintrusion of the lithosphere, in close agreement with the results from studies of the Illinois, \n\nMichigan and Williston basins. However, the Late Silurian/Early Devonian unconformity can be \n\nexplained by a eustatic sea level fall of less than 100 m. Smaller deviations from the exponential \n\nsubsidence expected from the thermal contraction of the lithosphere are probably owing to \n\nsedimentological effects or errors in the time scale.  \n\nMilani and Zal\u00e1n (1999) suggested a second transgressive-regressive cycle recorded by the \n\nsedimentary rocks composing the Devonian-Carboniferous Sequence, which was considered as the \n\nrecord of maximum paleobathymetric conditions during the history of the basin. In the upper units \n\nthis sequence recorded the regressive portion of the cycle. During the final stages of the \n\nMississipian age, a regional erosive process affected the Amazon Basin. \n\nTherefore, possible explanations as suggested in Nunn and Aires (1988) for rapid subsidence late in \n\nthe evolution of a sedimentary basin include a second rifting or intrusion event, thermal and/or \n\nstress relaxation of the lithosphere, and buckling by horizontal compression. According to Milani \n\nand Zal\u00e1n (1999), a renewed cycle of subsidence and sediment accommodation took place from the \n\nPennsylvanian onwards. The lowermost package of the Carboniferous-Permian Sequence is a \n\nblanket of eolian sandstones covered by a section of carbonates and evaporites, with subordinated \n\nsandstones and shales that may reach 1,600 meters in thickness. The cycle is closed by continental \n\nred beds of Permian age. East-West regional extension allowed a pervasive intrusion of magmatic \n\nbodies during the early stages of the Penatecaua Event. \n\nAccording Nunn and Aires (1988), during the Permian there is a rapid subsidence not compatible \n\nwith a rifting or intrusion event occurred in Penatecaua magmatism. There is another inconsistency \n\nin the magnitude of the late Carboniferous/Permian subsidence (maximum thickness of \n\napproximately 2.5 km) with a single thermal event in the Cambrian. If one assumes that only the \n\nvertical heat flow is important, it is known that the thermal subsidence of a sedimentary basin \n\ncannot overcome for more than about 150 My. \n\nIn summary, Nunn and Aires (1988) suggested the simplest explanation for the Paleozoic \n\nsubsidence in the Amazon Basin from the (1) initial rifting or intrusion event during the Cambrian \n\n\n\n \n\n \n20 \n\nor Early Ordovician followed by (2) an eustatic sea level fall in the Early Devonian temporarily that \n\nexposed the basin to erosion, and (3), a rifting or intrusion event, lithospheric relaxation, or \n\nhorizontal buckling, that produce a rapid subsidence in the late Carboniferous/Permian, and finally \n\nin (4) The Paleozoic sediments are uplifted, eroded, and intruded by basaltic rocks during the \n\nMesozoic. \n\nMilani and Zal\u00e1n (1999) point out a great similarity with the Solim\u00f5es Basin in terms of source \n\nrocks and cap rocks. The most probable ones are extensional fault-blocks, salt tectonics and \n\ntranscurrent movements during the Cenozoic. Significant differences with respect to the Solim\u00f5es \n\nBasin may also have occured by an early maturation of the organic matter by normal subsidence \n\nsince the Late Carboniferous with a peak in the Late Permian. The thermal effects of the Mesozoic \n\nmagmatism accelerated rates of maturation or promoted jumps in certain areas into higher thermal \n\nlevels. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n21 \n\nCHAPTER III \n\nIII. METHODOLOGY  \n\nThis chapter describes in a simple way the main gravity field principles, the methods and the tools \n\nused to the development this work, as the satellite gradiometry method, the terrestrial gravity data \n\nuses and the Geopotential Gravity Models (GGM). First, the GGM to be used for evaluating the \n\ngravity anomalies was analyzed, and then a topographic correction was calculated to the gravity \n\ndata for removing the significant high- and mid-frequency components caused by the attraction of \n\nthe Earth\u2019s topographic and isostatic masses. The geopotential models comission errors were then \n\nanalyzed by the comparison with the available terrestrial gravity data. The gravity gradient tensor \n\nvalues caused by a prism and a tesseroid model was then calculated in order to help in the forward \n\ngravity modelling. \n\nFor the described approach, the density distribution in the mantle/crust in the region of the Amazon \n\nand Solim\u00f5es sedimentary Basins was chosen as a study case, mainly because their large size, and \n\nby the lack of terrestrial data and the difficulty in the access of the area, the use of satellite mission \n\nderived fields is essential. \n\nIII.1. Gravitational Potential \n\nAccording to Heiskanen &amp; Moritz (1967), to calculate the gravitational potential V of a body in a \n\npoint P in the configuration shown in Figure III-1, it is necessary to consider the dimensions and the \n\ndensity distribution of the body, so a body of mass m can be divided into infinitesimal pieces of \n\nvolume dv' with density ?.  \n\nThe gravitational potential V originated by a body of mass m at the point P also defines the work \n\nrealized by the attractive force of gravity per unit mass, to move a body from that point to infinity. \n\nThe potential is a scalar or a tensor of zero order. From the theory of potential the gravitational \n\npotential at a point P in the Cartesian coordinate system (x, y, z) due to the attraction of a mass \n\ndistribution at point Q(x', y', z') with a density function ?(x', y', z') and volume v' can be written \n\ngenerically by the following volumetric integral  \n\n    \n \n\n \n  \n\n     III-1 \n\n\n\n \n\n \n22 \n\nwhere                            denotes the distance between the computation point \n\nP(x, y, z) and the element point (integration point) Q(x\u2019, y\u2019, z\u2019), known as the Euclidian distance, \n\ndefined in the local Cartesian coordinate system with axes pointing in the east, north, and up, where \n\n? is the density,               is the element of volume, and G is Newton\u2019s gravitational \n\nconstant. The gravitational force vector    is defined as the gravitational potential gradient.  \n\n \n\nFigure III-1: Gravitational potential of a solid body. \n\n                  \n  \n\n  \n \n  \n\n  \n \n  \n\n  \n \n \n\n III-2 \n\nThe gravitational potential V(x, y, z) is continuous throughout the space and vanishes at the infinity, \n\ndecaying with 1/r. This is due to the fact that for very large values of r, the body acts approximately \n\nas a point mass. Therefore, in celestial mechanics, the planets are generally considered as point \n\nmasses (Heiskanen &amp; Moritz, 1967). \n\nThe theoretical fundament of the gravity gradiometry follows Rummel (1986). The gravity \n\ngradients are the second order derivatives of the gravitational potential V, (?\n2\nV/?xi?xj = Vij), which \n\nform the nine components of the tensor (also known as components of the symetric Marussi tensor):  \n\nP(x,y,z) \n\n \n\nz \n\nx \n\nr \n\ny \n\nm \n\n              \n\n    \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\nQ(x\u2019,y\u2019,z\u2019) \n\n\n\n \n\n \n23 \n\n             \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n   \n\n   \n   \n\n    \n\n   \n\n    \n\n   \n\n    \n\n   \n\n   \n   \n\n    \n\n   \n\n    \n\n   \n\n    \n\n   \n\n    \n\n \n \n \n \n\n  \n         \n         \n         \n\n   \n\n         \n         \n         \n\n   III-3 \n\nThe symbol ?, called Laplacian Operator, is represented by \n  \n\n   \n \n\n  \n\n   \n \n\n  \n\n   \n with i, j ? {1,2,3} or i, j \n\n? {x,y,z} for the three axes of the adopted coordinate system.  \n\nThe first derivatives of the gravitational potential V generate the gravitational force components, \n\nwhich are also continuous in the whole space, but this is not true for the second derivatives. At the \n\npoints where the density changes discontinuously (i.e., inside of the source masses), some second \n\nderivatives present discontinuity, and so, the gravitational potential V (i.e., the trace of the tensor) \n\nsatisfies Poisson\u2019s equation          (Heiskanen &amp; Moritz, 1967). \n\nThe gradient tensor ?V (a 3 x 3 matrix) is symmetrical. Also, ?V is a rotational vector field and in \n\nthe empty space (vacuum), as the density is zero (? = 0), V satisfies Laplace\u2019s equation, and hence, \n\nthe trace of the tensor is zero: Vxx + Vyy + Vzz = 0. Thus, due to the symmetry confirmed by Laplace \n\nequation, the gradient tensor only contains five independent components, because     \n\n          . \n\nAccording to Equation III-1, the potential linearly decreases when the distance r increases. \n\nConsequently, the gravitational force and gravitational potential gradients attenuate as a function of \n\nr\n2\n and r\n\n3\n, respectively. \n\nGravity is a more familiar term, and with regard to a body at rest on the Earth's surface, the term \n\nexpresses the resultant gravitational plus centrifugal (due to Earth\u2019s rotation) force vector. These \n\ncombined forces acting on a unit mass denote the gravity vector g. Gravity is the magnitude of the \n\nvector g and has acceleration units. \n\nThe gravitational acceleration vector g is given by \n\n            \n \n\n     \n  \n\n  \n \n  \n\n  \n \n  \n\n  \n \n \n\n III-4 \n\nand the gravitational gradient (second derivate of the potential) is a tensor derived from these \n\nvalues. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n24 \n\nThe potential of the Earth (or geopotential), W, may be split into a gravitational part V and a \n\nrotational part ? \n\n      III-5 \n\nwhere the rotational potential is given by \n\n  \n \n\n \n     III-6 \n\nand ? is the velocity of rotation (in units of sec\n-1\n\n) (Heiskanen &amp; Moritz, 1967). \n\nIn geophysical applications, an ellipsoid of revolution is chosen to approximate the Earth\u2019s figure \n\nwhich is assumed to have an equipotential surface and defines a normal gravity potential U. The \n\ndifference between the geopotential (W) and the normal potential (U) is defined as the disturbing \n\npotential T, such that \n\n       III-7 \n\nIn the same way we get for the potential gradients: \n\n    \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n   \n\n   \n   \n\n    \n\n   \n\n    \n\n   \n\n    \n\n   \n\n   \n   \n\n    \n\n   \n\n    \n\n   \n\n    \n\n   \n\n    \n\n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\n         \n         \n         \n\n   III-8 \n\nwhere Txx is the rate of change of gravity in the x direction while a reference mass moves a known \n\ndistance in the x direction, and the same apply for the rest of the tensor; for example, Txy expresses \n\nhow the x component of the gravity changes in the y direction.  \n\nThe disturbing potential, such as the gravitational potential tensor, satisfies Laplace\u2019s equation \n\noutside of the masses and is symmetric relative to the main diagonal, and so, only five independent \n\ntensor components (Txx, Txy, Txz, Tyy and Tyz) remain. \n\nIII.2. The gravitational potential and its second derivatives for the prism \n\nAccording to Nagy et al. (2000), we can define a rectangular prism as a solid body given by X1, X2, \n\nY1, Y2, Z1 and Z2 coordinates (Figure III-2). The first simplification is to define the point P where \n\none wants to calculate the gravitational potential located at the origin of the coordinate system. In \n\n\n\n \n\n \n25 \n\npractice, the coordinates defining the prism should be transformed if the orientation of the \n\ncoordinate system has not been changed. This result in coordinates of integration as follow:  \n\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n III-9 \n\nThis simplification can be done without any loss of generality. Thus, all the computed values are \n\nvalid at O(0, 0, 0) ? P(X,Y,Z) (i.e., at x = 0, y = 0 and z = 0) (Nagy et al., 2000). \n\nThe disturbing potential at a point P(x, y, z) in the    space due to the prism is given by Eq.III-1 \n\nand may be rewritten as  \n\n           \n         \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n III-10 \n\nwhere             is Euclidian distance between the point P(x, y, z) and the mass element \n\nlocalized in the center of the prism (at point Q), ?? is the density and G is the gravitational constant. \n\nThe disturbing gravitational potential T(P) at P is evaluated as a volumetric integration on the body \n\nof volume v\u2019 represented by the ABCDEFGH prism with contrast of density constant shown in \n\nFigure III-2.  \n\nFigure III-2 shows the notation used for the rectangular prism in Nagy et al. (2000). Note that the \n\ncoordinate system used here is north-east-down (NED), where the positive x axis points to north, \n\nthe positive y axis points to east and positive z downwards. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n26 \n\n \n\nFigure III-2: Right rectangular prism and Cartesian coordinate system of the computation point P and the \n\nelement point Q (modified after Nagy et al., 2000). \n\nThe integral in the Eq.III-10 can be solved using the volume element of the prism (Montana et al. \n\n1992; Nagy et al. 2000, 2002), resulting in formulae due to the potential T(x, y, z): \n\n                                          \n  \n\n \n     \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n  \n\n \n     \n\n  \n\n  \n \n\n  \n\n \n     \n\n  \n\n  \n   \n     \n\n     \n   \n\nIII-11 \n\nReplacing all the limits of the gravitational potential equation for the rectangular prism results in an \n\nexpression with 48 terms. \n\nAlthough the potential T exists and is continuous in the whole    space, Eq.III-1 when applied to \n\nthe rectangular prism model as an analytical solution is not defined at all the points of   , because \n\nit can generate problems due to numerical estimation. At points where these terms are undefined \n\nthey should be assumed to be zero since they have a finite limit (Nagy et al., 2000). \n\nThe gradient of T is also continuous in the    space. Thus, the vertical component may be \n\nestimated by differentiating the Eq.III-11 with respect to z,  \n\nX \n\nx \n\nz \n\nY \n\nZ \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n  \n\ny \n\nQ \n\nP x\n2\n x\n\n1\n \n\ny\n2\n \n\ny\n1\n \n\nz\n2\n \n\nz\n1\n \n\nA \nB \n\nC D \n\nE F \n\nG \nH \n\nElement mass \n\n\n\n \n\n \n27 \n\n                                   \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n   \n     \n\n     \n    III-12 \n\nThe other two remaining derivatives, Tx and Ty, can be obtained from Tz by cyclic permutation, i.e., \n\n                                   \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n   \n     \n\n     \n   III-13 \n\nand \n\n \n\n                                   \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n   \n     \n\n     \n    III-14 \n\nIn the case where the second derivatives of the gravitational potential exist, we can obtain the \n\nfollowing expressions: \n\n                       \n     \n\n     \n   III-15 \n\n                       \n     \n\n     \n   III-16 \n\n                       \n     \n\n     \n   III-17 \n\n                  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n   \n     \n\n     \n   III-18 \n\n                  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n   \n     \n\n     \n   III-19 \n\n                  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n   \n     \n\n     \n   III-20 \n\nDiscretizing the Earth in m prisms, the disturbing potential T(P) generated for this forward model \n\ncomposed of prisms is given by \n\n           \n\n \n\n   \n\n III-21 \n\nNow, considering n computation points on the Earth's surface and M prisms, once the parameter ?? \n\nis constant within each prism (i.e., constant density contrast), we can rewrite the potential equation \n\nand/or the gravity tensor as a linear system of equations of the type \n\n\n\n \n\n \n28 \n\n       III-22 \n\nwhich is equivalent to \n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\nnnm\n\nm\n\nn\nGG\n\nG\n\nGGG\n\nT\n\nT\n\nT\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n??\n\n???\n\n??\n\n?\n\n?\n2\n\n1\n\n11\n\n11\n\n11211\n\n2\n\n1\n\n III-23 \n\nwhere G or Gnm is a matrix (n x m) usually called the sensitivity matrix of the system.

Gravity field representation in spherical harmonics  \n\nThe recovery of the gravity field from airborne and satellite data are based on the fundamental ideas \n\nof the global gravity field determination based on spherical harmonics expansion and differential \n\n(satellite) orbit improvement. In the following sections we review the contribution of the global \n\ngeopotential models to improve the understanding of the Earth\u2019s gravity field and the basic theories \n\nof the gravity anomalies and gradient components in spherical harmonic representations from global \n\ngeopotential models.  \n\nThe spherical harmonics allow to derive the elements of the gravity field from the global \n\ngeopotential models as the geoid, gradient tensor, Bouguer and free-air gravity anomaly, gravity \n\ndisturbance (the radial derivative of the disturbing potential), the deflection of the vertical \n\ncomponents (the first meridian and vertical) from the most recent geopotential models available. In \n\nthis section we will give a brief description of this methodology and its use for the interpretation of \n\npossible geophysical patterns and strong correlations present on the various elements of the gravity \n\nfield, as the geoid model and the diagonal elements of the gradient tensor in the Amazon and \n\nSolim\u00f5es Paleozoic basins of Brazil. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n36 \n\nOnly with satellites it is possible to cover the entire Earth's gravity field with measurements of \n\nuniform quality within a short period of time, resulting in a global geopotential model (GGM) in \n\nterms of the representation in spherical harmonic coefficients. However, the determination of the \n\ngravity gradient components from global geopotential models is a new regional approach that was \n\nexpected to be fulfilled with the GOCE satellite mission, which uses measures of the gravity \n\ngradiometry to obtain the geopotential models and the second derivatives of the Earth\u2019s \n\ngravitational potential. \n\nIII.4.1. Applications of global geopotential models in Geodesy and Geophysics \n\nThe global geopotential models is used in different branches of geodesy. The determination of \n\nprecise regional geoids are usually performed from a global geopotential model together with a set \n\nof points or mean terrestrial gravity anomalies and topographic information. In order to determine \n\nthe most appropriate geopotential model for this combination it is necessary to check the statistical \n\nfit of several high degree models for the gravity field. This includes setting the geopotential model \n\nfor obtain the geoid height geometrically in the study region (Kiamehr &amp; Eshagh, 2008). The best \n\ngeopotential model can be estimated by combining of the gravity data using the Stokes' formula \n\nmethod. The theoretical foundations for the representation of the geoid were developed by Stokes \n\n(1819 - 1903) in his work \"On the Variation of Gravity and the Surface of the Earth\", which \n\nexpresses geoid heights as a function of the gravity anomalies with the basic assumption of the \n\nexistence of topography only below the geoid. \n\nStill in the area of the geodesy, the conventional levelling is being replaced by the determination of \n\naltitudes by using the global positioning system (GPS). The GPS technique is used for levelling \n\nprojects, for example, to monitor the subsidence of the dam due to the removal of water or natural \n\ngas, crustal movements and for control heights in connection with the bridge construction and other \n\nengineering projects. The altitude obtained directly from the GPS measurement is the geometric \n\naltitude, a quantity that is referred to the reference ellipsoid. Figure III-5 shows the basic \n\nrelationship between the geometric altitude h, the orthometric altitude H and the geoid height N. In \n\na first approximation, the altitudes are related by: \n\n      III-52 \n\nThe main problem of transforming the geometric height obtained by GPS to orthometric height is to \n\ndetermine a reliable geoid height quantity. This geoid height can be obtained using a gravimetric \n\nmethod or a geopotential global model. In countries where there are no precise gravimetric geoid \n\nmodels, the geoid height obtained from global geopotential models plays an important role in this \n\n\n\n \n\n \n37 \n\ntransformation. Furthermore, the geoid height and the gravity anomalies have geophysical \n\napplications to study the properties within the Earth. \n\nThe deflection of the vertical is the angle between the normal of the reference ellipsoid and the \n\nplumb line (vertical) passing through the same point. This deflection is usually used to reduce the \n\nobservations, transforming the astronomical coordinates in geodesic coordinates and vice versa. \n\nSince the deflection of the vertical may represent variations in density within the earth it can be \n\nused in geophysical exploration. Studies of the horizontal and vertical components of the gravity \n\ntensor and the deflection of the vertical components made by Kiamehr et al. (2008) showed a good \n\ncorrelation between these quantities of the gravity field. Kiamehr (2006) found a good correlation \n\nbetween tectonic structure and deflection of the vertical. Therefore, the general pattern of deflection \n\nof the vertical computed by a global geopotential model can help in getting the information about \n\nthe lateral variation in density of the Earth. \n\n \n\nFigure III-5: Terrestrial surface for description of the external gravity field at P point involving \n\nthree surfaces in geodesy and gravity field: the physical surface of the Earth, the geoid surface and \n\nthe ellipsoidal surface, where n and v are the normal and vertical directions at the P point. \n\nIII.4.1.1. Parameters of the gravity field from the global geopotential models \n\nAccording to Kiamehr &amp; Eshagh (2008), from the 1960's to 1980's geodetic satellites provided the \n\ncomponents of medium and long wavelength of the gravity field, which are represented in spherical \n\nharmonics. Additionally, in 2000's with satellite gravimetry missions CHAMP (Reigber et al. \n\n2002), GRACE (Tapley et al. 2005) and more recently the satellite gradiometry mission GOCE \n\nEarth\u2019s surface \n\n(Topography) \n\nGeoid Ellipsoidal \n\nsurface   \n  \n  \n\nH \n\nP \n\nh \n\nv \nn \n\ni \n\nN \n\n\n\n \n\n \n38 \n\n(Pail et al. 2011), the quality of GGMs have significantly improved, especially in the long \n\nwavelengths associated with the Earth's gravity field. These missions have provided a homogeneous \n\ncoverage of the gravity field and at almost throughout all the globe, insofar as their orbits are nearly \n\npolar. \n\nThere are many areas in the Earth that are still with no significant gravity data measurements. In the \n\noceans the gravity anomalies are mostly determined from satellite altimetry, but the effects of the \n\nocean circulation currents and bias deteriorate these data. One important aspect about the solutions \n\nof the gravity field derived from satellite-only data is that they are not contaminated by systemetic \n\nerrors (see Appendix A for details).  \n\nHowever, a variety of the Global Geopotential Models (GGMs) which represented the Earth's \n\ngravity field in terms of the spherical harmonic functions have been computed for many groups, for \n\ninstance, GPM98 A, B, C (Wenzel, 1998), EGM96 (Lemoine et al. 1998) and more recent GGMs \n\nobtained from satellite gravimetry/gradiometry missions as CHAMP (Reigber et al. 2002), GRACE \n\n(F\u00f6rste et al. 2008) and GOCE (Pail et al. 2011) (Table III-1). This GGMs can be divided in three \n\ndifferent classes (Amos and Featherstone, 2008): \n\n? Satellite-only GGMs: are computed solely from the analysis of the orbits of artificial Earth \n\nsatellites (see examples in GGMs listed in the Table III-1); \n\n? Combined GGMs: are obtained from the combination of satellite data, land and ship track \n\ngravity observations, and marine gravity anomalies derived from radar altimetry, and airborne \n\nand/or gradiometer gravity data ; and \n\n? Tailored GGMS: are derived from an adjust of a GGM (only-satellite or combined) using \n\ngravity data that may not necessarily have been used before (in this case, the GGM can be often \n\nextended to higher degrees). \n\nTable III-1: Some examples of three different types GGMs. \n\nModel Degree Class author \n\nJGM-3 70 combined Tapley et al.

Geoid height, gravity anomalies and deflection of the vertical \n\ncomponents \n\nThe gravity field may be subdivided into two main spatial components, the long wavelengths (~ 400 \n\nkm) and short wavelengths (~ 25-100 km). The information of the long wavelength can be obtained \n\nby analysis of disturbing of the satellite orbits and from terrestrial gravimetric data or satellite \n\naltimetry. The result of this computation can be simplified in terms of a global geopotential model. \n\nIn Geodesy, the gravity data is used to define the figure of the Earth. In Geophysics, the gravity data \n\nis used to estimate the density variations in subsurface and to help to solve problems related to \n\ntectonic and geophysical exploration.  \n\nIn this context, the geodesists seek to use the differences between the difficulty of measuring the \n\npotential of the real Earth (or geopotential) and the potential of the normal Earth (or \n\nspheropotential). Such normal potential is obtained from a mathematical model and the residual \n\npotential is called the disturbing potential. The disturbing potential can be used to obtain very \n\nimportant quantities, which show how much the geopotential differs of the spheropotential. Also, it \n\ncan be considered as the potential produced by the terrestrial anomalous masses. Quantities of the \n\ngravity field such as the geoid height, the gravity anomaly and the deflection of the vertical \n\ncomponents are the main elements that can express the departure of the real gravity field in relation \n\nto the normal gravity field and can be interpreted geophysically. \n\nAnother useful quantity of the gravity field is the gravity tensor (second derivatives of the \n\ngravitational potential) that is again referred to the disturbing potential. Generally the gravity \n\ngradient components are referenced in a reference system oriented to the north. The origin of this \n\nsystem can be considered in the terrestrial surface or even in the satellite orbit. The z-axis is pointed \n\nin the geocentric radial direction and upward, the x-axis points to north and, consequently, the y-\n\naxis takes the west direction. \n\nFor the analysis of the gravity field, the disturbing potential (T) at any point can be represented by a \n\nspherical harmonic series (Heiskanen &amp; Moritz, 1967): \n\n\n\n \n\n \n40 \n\n         \n  \n\n \n   \n\n \n\n \n \n\n   \n \n\n   \n\n \n\n   \n\n                                III-53 \n\nwhere r, ?, ? are the geocentric distance, geodesics latitude and longitude respectively, GM is the \n\nproduct of the gravitational constant and of the mass of the Earth, a is the major semi-axis of the \n\nreference ellipsoid, L is the maximum degree of the expansion, l, m are the degree and order of the \n\nspherical harmonic expansion,      and      are the fully normalized geopotential coefficients and \n\n           are the normalized associated Legendre functions. According to Bruns\u2019 formula \n\n(Heiskanen &amp; Moritz, 1967), it follows that \n\n         \n  \n\n  \n   \n\n \n\n \n \n\n   \n \n\n   \n\n \n\n   \n\n                                III-54 \n\nwhere   is the normal gravity at the sea level at the latitude point estimated by Somigliana's \n\nformula. So, according to Heiskanen &amp; Moritz (1967), the gravity anomaly can be written as a \n\nfunction of the geopotential coefficients: \n\n          \n  \n\n \n   \n\n \n\n \n \n\n   \n \n\n   \n\n \n\n   \n\n \n   \n\n \n                                 III-55 \n\nThe deflection of the vertical is the angle between the gravity vector or the plumb line (the vertical \n\nline passing through a point) and the corresponding vector of the normal gravity on the ellipsoid at \n\nthe same point. The deflection of the vertical is typically given as north/south and east/west \n\ncomponents in seconds of arc, denoting the slope of the geoid with respect to the ellipsoid \n\n(Heiskanen &amp; Moritz, 1967). The deflection of the vertical components are also called the prime \n\nvertical or north/south (?) and the meridian or east/west (?) components. Thus, the deflection of the \n\nvertical components can be represented as: \n\n\n\n \n\n \n41 \n\n         \n  \n\n    \n   \n\n \n\n \n \n\n   \n \n\n   \n\n \n\n   \n\n          \n\n                                             \n\n         \n  \n\n  \n              \n\nIII-56 \n\n         \n  \n\n       \n   \n\n \n\n \n \n\n   \n \n\n   \n\n \n\n   \n\n                                  III-57 \n\nwhere,  \n\n  \n\n  \n \n\n          \n\n           \n \n \n\n                   III-58 \n\nand    is the normal gravity at equator,  \n  is the first eccentricity of the reference ellipsoid and k is \n\na constant based on the Somigliana's formula with k = 0.00193185353. ? is the Kronecker delta. \n\nIII.4.1.3. Gravimetric Reductions \n\nThe gravity anomaly is subject to different types of reductions depending on the purpose for which \n\nit is being determined. The gravity anomaly is the difference between the gravity acceleration \n\nmeasured at the physical (or terrestrial) surface (  ) (corrected the periodic variations and \n\ntopography) and the acceleration of gravity produced by a model of normal Earth ( ). The gravity \n\nanomalies are the values of the greatest interest in the applications of the gravimetry.  \n\nIt is known that the Stokes' formula assumes the knowledge of gravity over the whole surface of the \n\ngeoid, i.e. reduced the gravity at sea level, and it also assumes the absence of topographical masses \n\n(mass outside the geoid). However, it is necessary the application of methods of gravimetric \n\nreductions to eliminate or transfer to other positions the masses above the geoid (Heiskanen &amp; \n\nMoritz, 1967). \n\nThe gravity anomaly so far described as a function of geopotential coefficients can also be rewritten \n\nas  \n\n         III-59 \n\nwhen the gravity observed in the physical surface is reduced at sea level using the free-air \n\ncorrection (CFA), it generates the free-air anomaly  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n42 \n\n             III-60 \n\nSince the gravity is reduced to the sea level (geoid), for using the Stokes' integral it is necessary to \n\nremove the masses above the geoid (topographic masses), as well as the isostatic balance masses \n\n(i.e., the topographic-isostatic reduction of gravity) which accounts for an additional correction \n\ncalled Bouguer correction (CB), being the corresponding gravity anomaly the Bouguer anomaly \n\n(Heiskanen &amp; Moritz, 1967) \n\n                III-61 \n\nThe isostasy postulates the existence of an equilibrium state in the lithosphere, where the \n\ntopographic masses are floating in the mantle. There are two main types of isostatic compensation \n\nmodels of topographic masses: the first assumes that the topography is locally compensated and \n\nsuch compensation (local compensation) occurs directly below the topography by thickening of the \n\ncrust with constant density (Airy model) or by a lateral change in the crustal density (Pratt model). \n\nIn the second type, the flexure model, loads are partially supported by elastic stresses in a thin \n\nlithospheric plate lying on a fluid and the compensation occurs on a regional base (Vening-Meinesz \n\nmodel). In this model, the most important assumption is that the lithosphere behaves like a perfectly \n\nelastic plate. \n\nThe flexural model is similar to the Airy model, where the compensation of the topographic loads \n\noccurs due to the flexure down and a correspondent crustal thickening. The Airy model corresponds \n\nto a flexural rigidity of zero. A common approach to understand the form of the isostatic \n\ncompensation is to study the relationship between the topography and the gravity anomaly created \n\nby the mass anomalies in subsurface that compensate the topography. \n\nIn the areas where the crust is in isostatic equilibrium, it is appropriate to calculate the isostatic \n\ncorrection and therefore the isostatic anomaly corresponding can be given by: \n\n                   III-62. \n\nIII.4.1.4. Gradiometry: gravity gradient components \n\nThe expansions for gravity gradients in the local north-oriented reference frame have a complicated \n\nform depending on the first and second derivatives of the associated Legendre functions with \n\nrespect to the latitude, which contain, generally, factors tending to infinity when it approaches the \n\npoles. Here were used non-singular expressions for gravity gradients as presented by Petrovskaya &amp; \n\nVershkov (2006). The first and second order derivatives of the disturbing potential T in the local \n\n\n\n \n\n \n43 \n\nnorth-oriented reference frame {x, y, z} are considered by proceeding from a known relationship \n\n(Reed, 1973), but presented in terms of latitude rather than co-latitude. Thus, the ratio between the \n\ncomponents in the Cartesian coordinate in the local frame and in the geocentric spherical \n\ncoordinates becomes: \n\n        \n\n    \n \n\n \n   \n\n \n\n  \n    \n\n    \n \n\n \n   \n\n \n\n      \n   \n\n \n\n       \n    \n\n    \n \n\n      \n    \n\n    \n\n       \n   \n\n    \n \n\n  \n   \n\n \n\n \n    \n\n    \n \n\n      \n   \n\n \n\n     \n   \n\n \n\nIII-63 \n\n \n\nThe parameters of the gravity gradient are presented in an alternative form of Petrovskaya &amp; \n\nVershkov (2006) and their relations follow in Kiamehr et al.

Methods for Error Estimation \n\nIII.4.1.5.1. Errors GOCE: From Degree Amplitude to Gravity Anomaly errors \n\nin Spherical Harmonic \n\nWahr et al. (1998) supposed that the geoid is averaged over a time interval, and defined the error of \n\nthis averaged geoid in terms of the GGM estimate as: \n\n                    \n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\n   \n\n                          III-66 \n\nwhere ?Clm and ?Slm are the errors of the geopotential models coefficients. Then the spatial variance \n\nof the geoid error, taken over the entire globe, is \n\n    \n  \n\n \n\n  \n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n       \n \n\n \n\n                  \n      \n\n  \n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\n   \n\n III-67 \n\nThe degree amplitude or degree variances from the geopotential model error is defined as \n\n            \n      \n\n  \n\n \n\n   \n\n III-68 \n\nThe error estimate of the gravity anomaly is obtained similarly. Therefore the RMS (Root Mean \n\nSquare) anomaly errors per degree were computed by: \n\n       \n       \n\n  \n \n\n \n\n      \n      \n\n  \n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\n   \n\n  \n       \n\n  \n        \n\n      \n  \n\n \n\n   \n\n III-69 \n\n   \n  and    \n\n  are the total contributions to the variance of the geopotential model to the geoid and \n\ngravity anomaly error from all terms up to degree l. The degree l is a measure of the spatial scale of \n\na spherical harmonic. The half-wavelength of a (l, m) spherical harmonic serves as an approximate \n\nrepresentation of the spatial scale and is roughly given by 20,000 km/l. So    \n  and    \n\n  are a \n\nmeasure of the contribution to the variances from all the terms up to a given spatial scale. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n45 \n\nWahr et al. (1998) assumed that uncertainties in the estimates of ?Clm and ?Slm depend on l but not \n\non m (i.e., that the geoid error depends on wavelength but not on spatial orientation) and that the \n\nerrors in coefficients with different values of l and m are uncorrelated (equivalent to assuming that, \n\non average, this geopotential models will determine the geoid and gravity anomaly equally well \n\nover all regions of the globe). The geoid and gravity anomaly uncertainties can then be summarized \n\nby providing estimates of the expected ?Nl and ?gl as a function of l, and this is the form in which \n\nthe uncertainties were provided by the geopotential models. Since each ?Nl and ?gl involve the sum \n\nover (2l + 1) coefficients (note that Sl0 = 0 for each l), then an individual uncertainty ?Clm or ?Slm is \n\nequal to ?Nl or ?gl divided by      . \n\n \n\nFigure III-6: RMS errors in the gravity anomaly from the geopotential models and degree \n\namplitudes for GOCE and EGM08 in the gravity anomaly (free-air), signal, error and difference \n\nbetween EGM08 and GOCE. \n\nThe cumulative error in gravity anomaly for spherical harmonics coefficients of the GGMs up to \n\ndegree and order 250 is about 0.75 mGal for EGM2008 (Pavlis et al., 2008) and 1.39 mGal for the \n\nGOCE GGM (Pail et al., 2011). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n46 \n\nIII.4.1.5.2. Systematic errors of low spherical harmonic degrees in the surface \n\ngravity anomalies \n\nThe systematic errors of the low spherical harmonic degrees in the terrestrial gravity anomalies \n\nwere studied by Huang et al. (2008) supposing that the Earth gravity field determined by GGMs can \n\nbe modeled by spherical harmonics as follows \n\n            \n   \n\n \n\n   \n\n III-70 \n\nwhere ?g\nGGM\n\n is the gravity anomaly, L is the maximum degree of the global geopotential model \n\n(GGM) in spherical harmonics; gn is the spherical harmonic component of degree n and   \n    is the \n\ncommission error associated with the GGM. \n\nSimilarly, the terrestrial gravity anomaly ?g\nTG\n\n described in spherical harmonics can be expressed by \n\n           \n     \n\n     \n\n \n\n   \n\n  III-71 \n\nThe second and third terms on the right hand side are the low and high-degree systematic errors, \n\nrespectively. The last term ?n is the random error. By subtracting eq. (III-70) from eq.

(2008) assumed that if the error of the satellite models is much smaller than the \n\nsystematic error in the surface gravity data,     is approximately the low-degree systematic error in \n\nthe terrestrial data below degree L.

Spatial Averaging \n\nThere are many mathematical tools developed for smoothing the gravity field (Jekeli, 1981). In our \n\ncase we have calculated a grid of gravity anomaly values obtained from the GGMs, GOCE and \n\nEGM2008, with the standard spherical approximation that follows the series representation of \n\nHeiskanen and Moritz (1967) and terrestrial gravity anomaly values which we must reduce in a \n\nmean gravity anomaly through smoothing that correspond only to the long-wavelength part of the \n\nterrestrial gravity anomaly.  \n\nIn general, the global geopotential model approach uses the idea of constructing spatial averages to \n\ncompensate for poorly known, short-wavelength spherical harmonic coefficients to improve \n\nestimates of the Earth\u2019s gravity field. The terrestrial gravity anomalies encompass gravity \n\ncomponents with higher spherical harmonic degrees than those from the satellite data. However \n\nthese higher degree components require that an effective filtering or smoothing process to be \n\nperformed to the terrestrial data to make them comparable with the satellite data. Here, we will use \n\nthe Gaussian averaging function (Jekeli, 1981) to average the terrestrial data.  \n\nThe terrestrial data have more detailed and accurate information with regard to short-wavelengths, \n\nwhich will be used to obtain a mean gravity anomaly corresponding to long-wavelengths. The idea \n\nis to get the mean gravity anomaly from the terrestrial data with a Gaussian smoothing in at \n\ncorresponding grid point of the gravity anomalies calculated from the geopotential global models \n\n(for example: EGM08 and GOCE up to degree and order 250). So that we can make comparisons \n\nbetween the gravity anomalies at long wavelengths obtained from the global geopotential models \n\nand the terrestrial data, and so estimate the errors of the geopotential models when compared to the \n\nterrestrial data, or vice-versa, to estimate the errors of the terrestrial data. Below, we follow Jekeli\u2019s \n\nGaussian averaging function (Jekeli, 1981) normalized so that the global integral of W is 1 as in \n\nWahr et al.

UNDERSTANDING AND INTERPRETING THE \n\nGRADIENTS OF GRAVITY WITH A PRISM APPROACH FOR \n\nGRAVITY FIELD MODELLING \n\n\u201cRed October's captain is a man named Marko Ramius. That is a Lithuanian name, although we \n\nbelieve his internal passport designates his nationality as Great Russian. He is the son of a high \n\nparty official and as good a submarine commander as they have. He's taken out the lead ship of \n\nevery Soviet submarine class for the past ten years... Ramius inspected his status board. The Red \n\nOctober was heading southwest on track eight, the westernmost surveyed route on what Northern \n\nFleet submariners called Gorshkov's Railroad. His speed was thirteen knots. It never occurred to \n\nhim that this was an unlucky number, an Anglo-Saxon superstition. They would hold this course \n\nand speed for another twenty hours. Immediately behind him, Kamarov was seated at the \n\nsubmarine's gravitometer board, a large rolled chart behind him. The young lieutenant was chain-\n\nsmoking, and looked tense as he ticked off their position on the chart. Ramius did not disturb him. \n\nKamarov knew this job, and Borodin would relieve him in another two hours.  \n\nInstalled in the Red October's keel was a highly sensitive device called a gradiometer, essentially \n\ntwo large lead weights separated by a space of one hundred yards. A laser-computer system \n\nmeasured the space between the weights down to a fraction of an angstrom. Distortions of that \n\ndistance or lateral movement of the weights indicated variations in the local gravitational field. The \n\nnavigator compared these highly precise local values to the values on his chart. With careful use of \n\ngravimeters in the ship's inertial navigation system, he could plot the vessel's location to within a \n\nhundred meters, half the length of the ship.  \n\nThe mass-sensing system was being added to all the submarines that could accommodate it. \n\nYounger attack boat commanders, Ramius knew, had used it to run the Railroad at high speed. \n\nGood for the commander's ego, Ramius judged, but a little hard on the navigator. He felt no need \n\nfor recklessness. Perhaps the letter had been a mistake. No, it prevented second thoughts. And the \n\nsensor suites on attack submarines simply were not good enough to detect the Red October so long \n\nas he maintained his silent routine. Ramius was certain of this; he had used them all. He would get \n\nwhere he wanted to go, do what he wanted to do, and nobody, not his own countrymen, not even the \n\nAmericans, would be able to do a thing about it. That's why earlier he had listened to the passage of \n\nan Alfa thirty miles to his east and smiled.\u201d     \n\n\n\n \n\n \n50 \n\nTom Clancy in \u201cThe Hunt for Red October\u201d \n\nIV.1.

(2000) and Heck \n\nand Seitz (2007) \n\nIn order to analyze the feasibility of using rectangular prisms or tesseroids to calculate and to model \n\nthe geological structures, two simple models were constructed using the tesseroid and the prism \n\napproaches for calculation of the gravitational quantities: the first derivative of gravitational \n\npotential (vertical component of gravity) and the GG components. The quantities in gravity fields \n\nwere simulated at ground and at a height up to 250 km for analyze the gravity fields in the same \n\nheight of the GOCE satellite.  \n\nIV.2. Literature Review: History of Gravity Gradiometry \n\nThe cited passage at the beginning of this chapter is a fragments from the submarine novel The \n\nHunt for submarine Red October, (Clancy, 1984), written twenty eight years ago, which was also \n\nreadapted to the theater in 1990 by a movie of the same name receiving highly positive reviews and \n\nmaking it one of the top grossing films of the year. As pointed by Bell et al. (1997), in the \n\ngeophysical viewpoint, the tripulation of the Red October has gone as close to their goal as any \n\nexploration geophysicist would like to go using gravity gradiometry. \n\nDuring the cold war, as an effort to devise more stealthy aids to the underwater navigation, the \n\nUnited States (U.S.) and the Soviet Union defense department designed sensitive instruments that \n\ncould measure tiny variations in the pull of the gravity field caused by underwater ridges or \n\nmountains. This system is somewhat more complex than the one installed on the fictional \n\nsubmarine Red October, but the main ideia is quite the same. With the end of the Cold War, the \n\nintroduction of military technology for exploration geophysics and other fields has started. Three \n\nyears earlier, the U.S. Navy had already started the technological application of the gravity gradient \n\nin the underwater exploration industry (Bell et al. 1997; Bell, 1998). \n\nHowever, the history of gravity gradiometry began early in 1896 with the development of an \n\ninstrument known as the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Torsion Balance, essentially a gravity gradiometer, by Baron \n\nLor\u00e1nd von E\u00f6tv\u00f6s, a Hungarian physicist, to measure the minute variations in gravity over a short \n\ndistance. Thus, his instrument was the first geophysical device capable of delineating underground \n\ngeological structures. (Bell et al. 1997; Szabo, 1998; Nabighian et al. 2005; Rogers, 2009). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n51 \n\nInitially, the torsion balance was developed to measure the basic physical constants. Indeed, this \n\n\u201cgradiometer\u201d, or instrument for the measurement of the spatial derivatives or gradients of the \n\nEarth\u2019s gravity field measured the local distortion of the gravity field rather than its intensity. It was \n\na large instrument mounted on a tripod assembly (Figure IV-1), made of a metal beam that recorded \n\nthe gradient of the gravity suspended by a wire, with weights present at each end. If the gravity \n\nvaried with the position along the axis, the weights were placed on, and the force exerted on each \n\nweight would be different, thus causing a rotational force on the beam and in turn causing the wire \n\nto twist. So, E\u00f6tv\u00f6s measured the amount of twist to determine the gravity gradient (Hopkins, 1975; \n\nJekeli &amp; Zhu, 2006; Rogers, 2009). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV-1: Single E\u00f6tv\u00f6s\u2019 Torsion Balance designed for field work.

Courtesy of the Lor\u00e1nd E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Geophysical Institute (Szabo, 1998). \n\nAs described in Rogers (2009), in 1901 the head of the Hungarian geologic survey convinced \n\nE\u00f6tv\u00f6s to test the real-world usefulness of the torsion balance (i.e., the first investigations of the \n\nEarth's gravity field) to map the shape of a frozen lake basin, which had been already well mapped \n\nfrom previous summertime measurements made from a line and a sinker. The test was a success \n\nbecause the contour map so obtained matched the previously made maps. E\u00f6tv\u00f6s and Hugo de \n\nBoeckh then performed more difficult geological surveys in the region. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n52 \n\nThereafter, E\u00f6tv\u00f6s presented his results and demonstrated the operation of his torsion balance at the \n\n1906 World Congress of Geodesy (then the International Erdmessung). As a result, the Congress \n\npetitioned the Hungarian government requesting that an increased financial help should be given for \n\nE\u00f6tv\u00f6s\u2019 gravitational research. The Hungarian government agreed with the suggestion and from \n\n1907 onwards a separate fund was allocated for E\u00f6tv\u00f6s' gravitational studies (Szabo, 1998). Based \n\non the governmental support E\u00f6tv\u00f6s established the first applied geophysical Institute of the world \n\nin Budapest, which is now named the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd Geophysical Institute (ELGI). \n\nOn a global scale, understanding the details of the gravity field as well as developing the technology \n\nin general are critical in military applications. Despite the World War I has not introduced the use of \n\nthe gravity gradiometer technique, since World War II the research and the development in the \n\nareas of gravity instrumentation and building of global data bases were greatly encouraged. On an \n\nexploration scale, gravity has been widely used for both mining and oil exploration (particularly in \n\nthe U.S. Gulf Coast), and even at the reservoir scale for the hydrocarbon exploration development. \n\nHowever, the use of this technique began in U.S. only after the World War I, in 1922 and 1924, \n\nwhen American geologists of the Amerada Hess Corporation and Gulf identified the first salt domes \n\n(i.e., mushroom shaped underground diapiric salt geologic structures that often have oil and gas \n\ndeposits along their sides; since the salt is less dense than most rocks, it exerts a weaker \n\ngravitational force relative to the sediments surrounding it due to the large density contrast). As \n\nsuch, the gravity gradients can highlight a buried salt dome (Bell et al., 1997; Nabighian et al. 2005; \n\nRogers, 2009). \n\nSuddenly the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s\u2019 torsion balance success quickly spread to the oil prospectors around the world \n\nand the gravity method became the first geophysical technique to be used in oil and gas exploration. \n\nThus, officially the gravity gradiometry was born (Bell, 1998; Nabighian et al. 2005; Rogers, 2009). \n\nHistorically, hundreds of oil fields were discovered throughout the world with the help of E\u00f6tv\u00f6s\u2019 \n\ningenious instrument from the end of the 1910\u2019s and up to about 1940. The first geophysics \n\ngradiometer efforts occurred in Europe in 1915, in the upper Rhine Valey, and in northern Germany \n\nover a salt dome in 1918 which led to the mapping of the Czechoslovakian Egbell Oil Field \n\n(Schweydar, 1918 apud Nabighian et al. 2005; Bell et al. 1997). In U.S. other salt domes and oil \n\nfields were initially identified with gravity gradiometer, including the Lovell Lake field in Jefferson \n\nCountry, Texas and the South Houston Oil Field. When these salt domes were confirmed by others \n\ntechniques, drilling and seismic, the use of the gravity gradiometer had a boom, making this \n\ntechnique the most useful and routinely used technique in exploration technology for subsurface \n\nsurveys, particularly to oil exploration (Nabighian et al. 2005; Jekeli &amp; Zhu, 2006; Rogers, 2009). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n53 \n\nOn the other hand, despite the great success of the torsion balance, primarily in oil exploration to \n\nlocate salt domes, the difficulty to use it in the field caused it to be abandoned soon. The history \n\nreported that geoscientists could no longer afford the expense and the time required to obtain a \n\nreliable measurement (Nabighian et al. 2005).  \n\nRogers (2009) told that explorationists had to first clear a 100 meter long swath in eight directions, \n\nin a star pattern, from the location of the torsion balance to prevent the mass of the trees and rocks \n\nfrom corrupting the measurements; additionally, a small building had to be erected in order to \n\nprotect the instrument from the wind and from temperature changes. This in turn generated data \n\noften misinterpreted which led to erroneous survey because of the sensitivity of the device that \n\ncould corrupt its measurements even by the large belt buckles often worn by geoscientists. So, these \n\nissues led to the explosion of the use of the simpler gravimeters. \n\nThe gradiometers were quickly replaced in the 1930\u2019s and 1940\u2019s with the development of modern \n\nportable relative gravimeters that achieved sufficient accuracy for geophysical exploration as a \n\nconsequence of being inherently less sensitive than gradiometers, what required no extensive \n\nmeasurement site preparation and permitted the surveys to be carried on in only a fraction of the \n\ntime, about 10 times faster (Jekeli &amp; Zhu, 2006; Rogers, 2009). \n\nAnother important point is that the data from gravimeters was easiest interpreted. Firstly in the \n\n1930\u2019s, spring gravimeters came into their own and quickly displaced the torsion balance \n\ngradiometer. After that the first compact gravimeters proved to be portable, rugged and robust \n\ninstruments, capable of taking dozens of measurements on a daily basis. This led to increased \n\ninvestments in gravimeters and by the 1950's, gravimeters had replaced gradiometers in most of the \n\ngravity field measurement applications. So, the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s gravity gradiometer was dismissed, leaving \n\na brief passage on the historical sections of the gravity gradiometry (Nabighian et al. 2005; Jekeli &amp; \n\nZhu 2006; Rogers, 2009).  \n\nWith the advent of robust and practical field instruments, the use of gravity rapidly expanded in \n\nboth mining and hydrocarbon exploration for any targets for which there were a density contrast at \n\ndepth, such as salt domes, ore bodies, buried structures, and regional geology. However, even with \n\nthe success of the gravimeters, at that moment, the gravity gradiometer was temporarily gone, but \n\ncertainly it was not forgotten (Nabighian et al. 2005; Rogers, 2009). \n\nIn the 1970\u2019s, there was a new wave of research about the importance of gravity gradiometers \n\ndeveloped into moving based systems, which basic physical principles are identical to the case of \n\n\n\n \n\n \n54 \n\nthe satellite, capable of conducting a gravity survey over large areas with minimum expenditure of \n\ntime (Hopkins, 1975).  \n\nAt the same time, the U.S. Air Force had abandoned their gravity systems for Airborne surveys due \n\nto the problem of sensitivity to the aircraft accelerations, which was the main cause of the inertial \n\nand kinematic acceleration afflicting any gravimeter (or accelerometer) on a moving base, \n\naccording to Einstein\u2019s well known equivalence principle, and then overwhelmed the anomalous \n\ngravimetric signal on the aircraft in flight. However, gravity gradiometers are not affected by this \n\ninability of separating inertial from attractional effects (due to the pure local validity of Einstein\u2019s \n\naforementioned principle) and gradiometers approximate the (infinitesimal) gradients by finite \n\ndifference observations. Modern three-dimensional gravity gradiometers have meanwhile been \n\ndeveloped, which can successfully measure the second derivatives of the potential in satellites. \n\nSo, airborne gradiometry tecnology was considered the only way to solve the problem of moving-\n\nbase gravimetry. With the advent of the modern Global Positioning System (GPS), positioning \n\nquickly upgraded to a high level of precision, and kinematic accelerations could be determined \n\nindependently with sufficient accuracy to be used in aerogravimetry in general. Furthermore, \n\ngradiometers devices equipped with this GPS technology could flown on surveys with very closely-\n\nspaced lines (Groten, 1989; Nabighian et al. 2005; Jekeli &amp; Zhu 2006; Rogers, 2009). \n\nIn 1973, Bell Aerospace Textron, nowadays owned by Lockheed Martin, developed the first \n\nmodern gravity gradiometer FTG (Full Tensor Gradient) system for the U.S. defense department, \n\ncommissioned by the U.S. Navy. The device was deployed on board ships and housed in a \n\nrecreational vehicle. Its applications were to assist navigation in stealth mode for U.S. submarines \n\nusing inertial navigation systems, as the data provided the most accurate mapping of the \n\nbathymetry, and also to the Air Force Geophysics Laboratory (AFGL) for its regional airborne \n\ngravity survey system. The FTG configuration consisted of 12 individual accelerometers mounted \n\non 3 rotating disks (gravity gradiometers). All the five independent tensor components of the \n\ngravity field were successfully measured by this configuration (Nabighian et al. 2005; Zuidweg and \n\nMumaw, 2007; Rogers, 2009). \n\nAlthough the submarine fiction mentioned in the beginning of this chapter had described that both \n\nU.S. and Russian navies had the technology of submarine launched ballistic missiles, which \n\ndepended greatly upon a precise knowledge of gravity at the time of missile launch, it is known that \n\nat that time no Soviet vessel actually carried such elaborate gear of ballistic-missiles. In that \n\noccasion, only the U.S. Navy had invested hundreds of millions of dollars in developing a FTG \n\n\n\n \n\n \n55 \n\nsystem driven by the requirements for navigation and launching of missiles (Bell et al. 1998, \n\nNabighian et al. 2005; Jekeli &amp; Zhu 2006; Rogers, 2009).  \n\nIn the mid 1980's, part of this technology was declassified and eventually used in 1987 by the \n\nDefense Mapping Agency (DMA) flight tests of the Gravity Gradiometer Survey System (GGSS). \n\nIn the 1994, the Bell Geospace commercialized it in offshore surveys on smaller ocean-going \n\nvessels, in the region of the Gulf of Mexico, for the marine oil exploration, as the Marine-FTG\u2122 \n\nsystem. Later, this test was accomplished by AFGL and the system was successfully tested on a \n\nsingle engine aircraft in 2001, constituting the first airborne gravity gradiometer survey published in \n\nthe open literature (Nabighian et al. 2005; Rogers, 2009). Thus, in 2002, the Airborne FTG system \n\nhas been migrated operationally from marine to airborne use, and the Air-FTG\n\u00ae\n was quickly \n\nadopted by the mineral industry as a promising exploration tool (Hammond and Murphy, 2003; \n\nMurphy, 2004; Nabighian et al. 2005; Zuidweg and Mumaw, 2007; Rogers, 2009). \n\nSince those initial marine trials from 1994, several systems have been deployed up to date; there are \n\nbasically two types of gravity gradiometers designed by Lockheed Martin that are operational: the \n\nFTG and the BHP Falcon. This latter was the first airborne gravity gradiometer, FALCON\n\u00ae\n\n, \n\ndesigned 1999 by BHP Billiton, primarily for shallow targets of interest to mineral exploration. It \n\nconsists of four accelerometers configured to measure the horizontal curvature, from which the \n\nvertical gradient and vertical component of the gravity field are computed (Lee, 2001). \n\nNevertheless, Nabighian et al. (2005) commented that there were three teams that were designing \n\nnew systems to add to the suite of airborne gravity gradiometers: Stanford University, ArkEx and \n\nUniversity of Western Australia. \n\nBy the early 2000's, gradiometers experienced also a resurgence, at least on paper initially, with the \n\nadvent of satellites since only the curvature of the gravitational potential field can be sensed on a \n\nfreely falling body (such as a satellite), and so the gravity field missions have given they \n\ncontribution to determine the Earth's gravity field in the past decade. However, the gradiometer \n\ntechnology continued with the promise of the eventual deployment of such a system in space, and, \n\nafter two potential missions were abandoned, the CHAMP (CHAllenging Minisatellite Payload) \n\nMission (Reigber et al. 2002) was launched in July 2000, as the first mission that combined \n\nsatellite-to-satellite tracking in mode high-low (SST-hl) with 3-D accelerometry (ESA, 1999; \n\nRummel et al. 2002; Nabighian et al. 2005). \n\nIn March of 2002 Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) Mission was launched, \n\nbased on the pioneer low\u2013low satellite-to-satellite tracking (LL-SST) concept. The mission consists \n\nof two identical satellites following each other in the same orbit, at the height of 500 km, and a \n\n\n\n \n\n \n56 \n\ndistance between the satellites of about 220 \u00b1 50km, providing global and high-resolution estimates \n\nof the Earth\u2019s gravity field and its temporal variations (Tapley et al., 2004). Hence, both GRACE \n\nsatellites carried on board a 3-D accelerometer, and although in practice they are not satellites using \n\ngravity gradiometry (SGG), the configuration itself can be viewed as a huge one-component \n\ngradiometer with an arm length of 250 km. Consequently, the GRACE mission can be considered \n\npotentially a precise one dimensional (1-D) virtual gradiometer (Rummel et al. 2002; Keller and \n\nSharifi, 2005; Yi et al. 2010).  \n\nFinally, in March of 2009, the GOCE (Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer) \n\nMission was launched by the European Space Agency\u2019s (ESA), being the first core explorer \n\nmission in the Living Planet program, putting in practice by the first time in history the principle of \n\nSGG used in space with a tri-dimensional gradiometer on board to measure the GGs of the Earth \n\n(ESA, 1999; Rummel et al. 2002; Keller and Sharifi, 2005; Yi et al. 2010).  \n\nToday, airborne gravity gradiometry systems are used mainly for geological surveys in the search \n\nfor valuable natural resources as oil, gas, copper, iron, ore, diamond mineral deposits to mining \n\nexploration, and also to better understand the Earth's gravity field and the overall structure in a \n\nregional and global geologic scale (Nabighian et al. 2005; Rogers, 2009). \n\nThe use of gravity gradiometry for exploration purposes continues to grow. The most promising \n\nresults so obtained are the instrument drift reduction, the common cancellation of the platform \n\naccelerations, and the fact that several independent channels (tensor components and standard \n\ngravity) are recorded simultaneously. All this facts probably play a major role in assessing the \n\nadded value of tensor gravity data over using the gravity data alone. According with Jorgensen et al. \n\n(2001), a key value of the tensor data lies in the ability to achieve a high level of enhancement of \n\nthe signal-to-noise ratio for each of the tensor channels and the gravity channel. This enhancement \n\nis achieved by operating on all the channels simultaneously, using techniques that remove noise \n\nsources from all the input channels. \n\nMany world-renowned exploration companies, such as Bell Geospace, ARKex, Gedex and Fugro \n\nprovide airborne gravity gradiometry surveys to customers who desire such data. This data have \n\nenormous advantage over the conventional gravity (land, marine and airborne) due to their noise-\n\nreduction capabilities, the speed of acquisition, and the improved accuracy. With appropriate \n\nprocessing, the gradiometer sensitivity can be as low as 3 to 8 Eotvos (1 Eotvos = 0.1 mGal/km), \n\nand it can resolve wavelengths of about 300 to 1000 meters (Nabighian et al. 2005; Rogers, 2009). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n57 \n\nOf all the applications and purposes described above, gradiometers have been installed and used \n\nwith success on ships, aircraft and now in satellites. This latter are being used primarily to \n\nunderstand the Earth's gravity field globally from gravity gradients measurements by GOCE SSG. \n\nIn this context this thesis uses the GOCE gradiometric data for the geophysical proposal presented \n\nin the previous chapters. \n\nIV.3. Satellite Gradiometry Technology with GOCE \n\nThe drag free satellite of SST can be viewed as a set of proof masses in free fall, subject only to the \n\ninfluence of the gravitational field, with their relative line-of-sight movement being measured. The \n\nsatellite gradiometer senses the gravitational field simultaneously in several directions. In other \n\nwords, the complete curvature structure of the local gravitational field is measured. \n\nGOCE's system consisting of the sensor and the control elements form one \u2018gravity-measuring \n\ndevice\u2019 orbiting at the height of about 250 km. The satellite itself also acts as a prime sensor, so, in \n\ncontrast to most remote-sensing missions, there is virtually no division between the satellite and the \n\ninstruments.  \n\nGOCE carry an electrostatic gravity gradiometer (EGG), a GPS receiver to allow use of high-low \n\nSatellite-to-Satellite Tracking Instrument (SSTI), a compensation system for all non-gravitational \n\nforces acting on the spacecraft (such as air-drag and radiation pressure), a very sophisticated \n\npropulsion system, a laser retro-reflector to enable tracking by ground-based lasers as well as star \n\ncameras to control the satellite attitude providing the absolute orientation (i.e., angular \n\nmeasurements into rates and angles) and a set of very-low frequency components; the twice-\n\nintegrated angular accelerations are deduced from the accelerometer readings of the gradiometer \n\n(Figure IV-2). Thus, the gradiometer is used as a gyroscope, and its observations are used to \n\nstabilize the attitude information. (ESA, 1999; Pail, 2005; Bouman et al. 2009). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n58 \n\n \n\nFigure IV-2: Concept of GOCE Gravity Gradiometer Satellite with satellite to satellite tracking \n\n(SST) (modified after ESA, 1999). \n\nThe GOCE satellite gradiometer consists of three pairs of ultra-sensitive accelerometers which \n\nmeasure acceleration differences, ideally in all three spatial dimensions, between the test-masses of \n\nan ensemble of accelerometers present inside the satellite (Figure IV-3). Every accelerometer has \n\ntwo high sensitive axes, and one less sensitive axis (Figure IV-4). The measured signal is the \n\ndifference in the gravitational acceleration at the test-mass locations inside the spacecraft. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nGOCE Gradiometry \n\nSatellite Earth\u2019s surface \n\n(Topography) \n\nAnomalous \n\nmass \n\n \n\n \n  \n\nGPS Satellites \n\n \n\nGeoid \n\nEllipsoidal \n\nsurface \n\nGPS Track \n\nSST-LL \n\nSST-HL \n\n      \n\n\n\n \n\n \n59 \n\n \n\nFigure IV-3: Payload Electrostatic Gravity Gradiometer. Courtesy: European Space Agency \n\nThe spacecraft is kept Earth-oriented with its x-axis pointing along-track, the y-axis cross-track and \n\nthe z-axis radially outwards. The orientation of the satellite is maintained by an active attitude \n\ncontrol using proportional thrusters and, as control elements, a star tracker and the gradiometer. \n\nThe Satellite-to-Satellite Tracking Instrument (SSTI) consists of an advanced dual-frequency, 12-\n\nchannel GPS receiver and an L-band antenna. The SSTI receiver is capable of acquiring signals \n\nsimultaneously broadcasted from up to 12 spacecraft in the GPS constellation. The SSTI delivers, at \n\n1Hz, pseudo-range and carrier-phase measurements on both GPS frequencies, as well as a realtime \n\norbit navigation solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n60 \n\n \n\nFigure IV-4: Position of the 6 accelerometers in the GOCE gradiometer in GRF (Gradiometer \n\nreference Frame) and all ARF (Accelerometer Reference Frame). The axes of the ARF are shown \n\nby solid arrows ultra-sensitivite aligned with the axes of the accelerometer. The axes of ARF shown \n\nby the dotted arrows are aligned to the axes of the accelerometer less sensitive. Each colour \n\nrepresents a one-axis gradiometer. The shadowed surfaces represent the locations of the lower \n\nplates (and the sole plates) (Gruber et al., 2009; See ANNEX A). \n\nThe advanced drag compensation and the attitude-control system is a key feature required to keep \n\nthe accelerometer sensor heads in near 'free fall motion' and to maintain the orbit altitude at about \n\n250 km. The system is based on ion-propulsion technology. The electric ion propulsion system \n\ncomprises two thruster units (one as backup) mounted at the back of the satellite. The thrusters can \n\nbe throttled between 1 and 20 millinewtons (mN), which is set automatically, depending on the \n\nactual real-time drag that the satellite experiences in orbit. \n\nA particular feature of the GOCE system design is that the drag-free and attitude-control system use \n\nthe scientific payload as a sensor. The laser retroreflector allows GOCE's precise orbit to be tracked \n\nby a global network of ground-based stations through the Satellite Laser Ranging Service. This \n\nprovides accurate positioning for orbit determination and data products. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n61 \n\nScience data are continuously delivered to ground (1 Hz data rate); there are no gaps in the \n\ngradiometer data stream. \n\nIV.4. Gradiometry Principle  \n\nThe theoretical foundations of the gravity gradiometry is presented by Rummel (1986); the basic \n\nobservable elements of the mission are GGs, the second order derivatives ?\n2\nV/?xi?xj = Vij of the \n\ngravitational potential V with nine components, as showed in Chapter III. These GGs can be defined \n\nin a local north oriented frame (LNOF), i.e., x-axis is pointing North, y-axis towards West and z-\n\naxis pointing radially outward in geocentric radial direction. \n\nThe principle of operation of the gradiometer relies on measuring the forces that maintain a proof \n\nmass at the centre of a specially engineered cage. Servo-controlled electrostatic suspension provides \n\ncontrol of the proof masses in terms of linear and rotational motion. Two of the floors support the \n\ngradiometer, which is mounted at the heart of the satellite close to its centre of mass. Three pairs of \n\nidentical accelerometers, which form three gradiometer arms, are mounted on the ultra-stable \n\nstructure. The difference between accelerations are measured by each of two accelerometers (which \n\nare about 50 cm apart), in the direction joining them contains the basic gradiometric information. \n\nThe average of the two accelerations is proportional to the externally-induced drag acceleration \n\n(common mode measurement). The three arms are mounted orthogonally to each another: one \n\naligned with the satellite's trajectory, one perpendicular to the trajectory, and one pointing \n\napproximately towards the centre of Earth. By combining these different acceleration \n\nmeasurements, it is possible to derive the gravity-gradient components. \n\nThe gradiometer in GOCE Satellite consists of six 3-axis accelerometers mounted in pairs along \n\nthree orthogonal arms (Figure IV-4). Each accelerometer with three axes i = 1, 2, 3 (or x, y, z) \n\nsenses e.g. the acceleration \n\n   )0()0(/)0( ijijjkjikjijii bdxdxdxVxVf ???????????\n?

It represents the once-per-revolution rotation of the Earth \n\npointing satellite: ?y \u00bb ?x, ?z. \n\nSo, one can draw the following conclusions: \n\n- Ideally, when differencing the accelerations fi, all non-gravitational accelerations bi (0) drop out, \n\nas well as the gravitational accelerations ?V(0)/?xi, see eq. (IV-1 and IV-2). \n\n- The gravitational gradients cannot be sensed in isolation. They are mixed with centrifugal and \n\nangular acceleration terms, see eq. (IV-3). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n63 \n\n- The angular accelerations can be isolated and, after integration, they can be employed for the \n\nangular control of the spacecraft. \n\n- One time-integration of the angular accelerations yields to the angular velocities, which are used \n\nto isolate Vij from ?ik ?kj. \n\n- For GOCE, with one axis of each accelerometer weaker than the two others, the arrangement of \n\nthe six 3-D accelerometers is chosen such as to permit precise determination of ?y, whereas ?x \n\nand ?z are not determined as well. Consequently, only Vxx, Vyy, Vzz and Vxz can be reproduced \n\nwith highest precision. \n\n- Below 3 ? 10\n-2\n\n Hz the component Vxz is less accurate than the three diagonal components. This is \n\ncaused by the uncertainty in the orientation angles, which results in a projection of the large \n\ndiagonal components onto the off-diagonals. Nevertheless Vxz has a positive effect on the overall \n\nresults. \n\n- The sum, i.e. the common mode accelerations fi (A) + fi (B), are a measure of the non-\n\ngravitational accelerations \n\n,)0(2)()(\niii\n\nbBfAf ???  IV-7 \n\nif the accelerometers are arranged symmetrically with respect to the centre of mass of the \n\nspacecraft, for then ?V(0)/?xi ? 0, see eq. (IV-1). They are then employed for drag-free control \n\n(together with the GPS orbits). \n\nThree critical areas emerge that deserve careful attention: \n\n- The accelerometers are \"no perfect twins\". This is caused by imperfect scale factor matching, \n\nalignment and positioning along one axis. As a result one needs a comprehensive calibration \n\nscheme that includes laboratory, on-board and post-mission tests. Another remedy is to keep linear \n\nand angular disturbances (non-gravitational and apparent forces) low by active drag and angular \n\ncontrol. \n\n- Centrifugal and angular accelerations mix inevitably into the gravitational gradients. Separation of \n\nthe anti-symmetric from the symmetric tensor part will help to determine ?y and to a lesser extent \n\n?x and ?z. The trace condition will yield the sum of ?x\n2\n + ?y\n\n2\n + ?z\n\n2 \nas control information. Finally \n\nstar trackers provide absolute orientation at 10 seconds intervals. An additional option is the \n\nparameterization of misorientation angles in the context of the data processing. Thus an isolation of \n\nthe gravitational tensor alone is feasible. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n64 \n\n- The third error source is the effect of time variable self-gravitation of the spacecraft. On the one \n\nhand it can be kept below the required threshold by choosing a very stiff instrument and satellite \n\nconstruction (no moving parts). On the other hand thruster fuel consumption is of concern. The \n\nchoice of ion thrusters for the attitude control and cold gas thrusters for the drag control eliminates \n\nthis problem. \n\nIV.5. Understanding the gravity gradients \n\nNowadays, the use of gravity gradients (GGs) data in exploration is relatively common. \n\nNevertheless, interpretation of GG data is not as easy as with the familiar vertical gravity data. Saad \n\n(2006) showed that for a given source, regardless of its simplicity, GGs often produce a complex \n\npattern of anomalies (single, doublet, triplet, or quadruplet) as compared to the simple single \n\n(monopolar) gravity anomalies. The six independent GGs recovered from gravity gradiometry \n\nprovide a powerful tool for delineating the shape of the body. The GGs can detect the edges, \n\ncorners and center of the mass distribution.  \n\nSince 1990\u2019s, moving-platform gravity gradiometers had become\n \navailable and played an important \n\nrole in\n \nexploration. Data reduction, filtering, and visualization, together with low-cost, \n\npowerful\n \npersonal computers and color graphics, have transformed the interpretation of\n\n \ngravity data \n\n(Nabighian et al. 2005). \n\nMany authors (e.g.: Montana et al. 1992; Nagy et al. 2000; Saad 2006; Heck and Seitz 2007) have \n\ndemonstrated the complex pattern of anomalies associated to gravity gradient components \n\ncalculated from gravitational potential generated from a basic building block - a rectangular prism. \n\nIn this work a forward modelling using the rectangular prism approach developed by Nagy et al. \n\n(2000) is used. \n\nDue to its simplicity and its closed expressions relating to the gravitational potential, the use of the \n\nrectangular prism is of great interest in gravity modelling. Any three-dimensional density \n\ndistribution can be approximated with the desired accuracy using the prisms. \n\nAlthough the geometry of the rectangular prism limit its applicability over large areas because it \n\nimplies an approximation of the flat Earth, it is still a good alternative for describing the density \n\ndistribution and it is especially useful in studies for gravitational potential modelling (Nagy et al. \n\n2000).  \n\nAs discussed by Bell et al. (1997), the Figure IV-5 illustrates an schematic example and shows the \n\ncomparison of the power spectrum of standard gravity data (in dashed lines) against the gravity \n\ngradients data (solid line). One can observe that the power spectrum of the standard gravity begins \n\n\n\n \n\n \n65 \n\nto flatten in a hypothetical value given in a certain wavelength indicating the resolution of the data. \n\nThe integration of the gravity gradiometry measurements into gravity data (actually, the vertical \n\ncomponent) significantly changes the power spectrum slope, indicating an improvement of the \n\nresolution for small features. The steepness of the power spectrum below the resolution suggests \n\nthat gravity gradients significantly improve the capability of gravity to constrain the location of \n\nstructures. \n\n  \n\nFigure IV-5: Power spectrum schematic of the first (vertical component, Tz) and second (Tzz \n\ncomponent) derivatives of gravitational potential. The graphic on left illustrates the theoretical \n\ncurves flattening gravity power spectrum indicating the resolution limit of the data. On the right the \n\npower spectrum shows a more realistic pattern of the gravity and the gradient gravity data (modified \n\nafter Bell et al. 1997). \n\nIV.5.1. Rotational Invariants \n\nPedersen and Rasmussen (1990) described the use of the invariance to obtain a new representation \n\nof the gravity and magnetic tensor components. They described two sets of combinations that make \n\nuse simultaneously of all components. The impact of the resultant computation is that the \n\nanomalous signature pattern is independent of the choice of the axes of the observer. \n\n                                \n     \n\n     \n   IV-8 \n\nP\no\n\nw\ne\nr \n\nS\np\n\ne\nc\ntr\n\nu\nm\n\n \n\nWavelength \n\n \n\nLong Short \n\nPower Spectrum of \nObserved Gravity (Tz) \n\nPower Spectrum of \n\nGravity Enhanced by \n\nGradiometer \n\nMeasurements \n\n \n\nRegion of enhanced \nHigh Fidelity \nImaging Possible \nWith Observed \nGravity Gradients \n(Tzz) \n \n\nP\no\n\nw\ne\nr \n\nS\np\n\ne\nc\ntr\n\nu\nm\n\n \n\nLong Short \n\nPower Spectrum of \nObserved Gravity \n(vertical component) \n\nRegion of enhanced \nHigh Fidelity Imaging \nPossible With \nObserved Gravity \nGradients (Tzz) \n\nResolution Floor \n\nPower Spectrum of \nGravity Enhanced \nby Gradiometer \nMeasurements \n\nWavelength \n\n\n\n \n\n \n66 \n\n                   \n                                          \n\n   \n\n IV-9 \n\nThe I1 facilitates the general mapping of the regional stratigraphy on areas of surveys, which \n\nidentify the dominant density contrast. It is used in practice of mapping on a regional scale and \n\nextract trends in dominant regional density distribution. I2 focuses highlighting the 3D shape of the \n\nanomalous targets. This makes it useful for mapping the geometry of a fault block, an igneous \n\nintrusion and salt bodies directly from the gravity gradient data. \n\nIV.5.1.1. Horizontal invariant Lineaments \n\nMurphy (2007) described an invariance approach for horizontal components only. These invariants \n\ncan be used to map linear features making it an effective edge mapper. The representations of the \n\nhorizontal components are: \n\n                 \n     \n\n   IV-10 \n\n                    \n   \n\n       \n\n \n \n\n \n\n  IV-11 \n\nDickinson et al. (2009) showed that the advantage of the anomalous expression\u2019s independence is \n\ngiven in the vertical axis only, increasing the confidence of mapping the geological contact \n\ninformation with depth. The result is better obtained by combining the results of both from direct \n\ncomparison with the original Tzz anomaly field (i.e., a positive trend in InVar_TxzTyz is correlated \n\nwith a negative linear trend in InVar_TxyTxxTyy maps in an anomalous edge in Tzz). \n\nIV.5.1.2. Strike Lineaments  \n\nThe impact of these two techniques is an improved method for mapping subsurface geology in a \n\nqualitative manner. These equations can be solved in different way. The result is a measure of the \n\nstrike angle (or strike direction) to identify linear features from subsurface geology. \n\nPedersen and Rasmussen (1990) obtained a formula for the calculation the strike direction from the \n\ngradient tensor: \n\n        \n                   \n\n   \n     \n\n     \n     \n\n \n IV-12 \n\n\n\n \n\n \n67 \n\nObserve that the rotating of the coordinate system in the vertical axis aims to minimize the sum of \n\nthe squares of the three tensor components involving a derivative in x-direction. The method \n\nproduces an estimate of ?s (strike angle) in every observation site. The strike direction is evaluated \n\nbased on its geological importance and continuity along the line which, within a defined tolerance, \n\ncan be chained together to form lineaments. (Dickinson et al. 2009). \n\nIt should be noted that the pattern of anomalies so produced is dependent of the coordinates. \n\nHowever, it can only use patterns and shapes of the gravity gradient anomalies with the outline \n\ndesigned. \n\nVarious combinations of the gravity gradient components can be used to simplify its complex \n\npattern by adding an improvement and helping in the interpretation of the data. For example: \n\namplitude of the horizontal gradient of vertical gravity (Tz); amplitude of the total gradient or \n\nanalytic signal of Tz; and the differential curvature, which is also known from the early torsion \n\nbalance literature as the horizontal directive tendency (HDT). The amplitude of the horizontal \n\ngradient of Tz can be used as an edge-detector or to map body outlines. The analytic signal can be \n\nused for depth interpretation. The magnitude of the differential curvature emphasizes greatly the \n\neffects of the shallower sources (Saad, 2006). \n\nAmplitude of the horizontal gradient of vertical gravity (Tz):  \n\n       \n     \n\n  IV-13 \n\nAmplitude of the total gradient or analytic signal of Tz:  \n\n        \n     \n\n     \n  IV-14 \n\nDifferential curvature:  \n\n             \n \n\n       \n \n IV-15 \n\nSaad (2006) describes the combining GG products to obtain the three invariants above showing the \n\nusefulness in simplifying and highlighting the complex pattern of the anomalies about the source, \n\nproviding further enhancements to the high frequency of anomalies due to shallow sources and \n\nproducing coordinate-independent or invariant anomalies. These are easier to interpret than the \n\noriginal gradient components. Other coordinates independent invariants can be obtained and also \n\nused to interpret the data using different combinations of GG components. For example, one can \n\n\n\n \n\n \n68 \n\ncompute also the horizontal and total gradient of Tx and Ty as well as those already described by \n\nPedersen and Rasmussen (1990). \n\nGravity gradiometry data differ in many aspects of the \u2018conventional\u2019 terrestrial gravity data. An \n\nimportant difference is in the bandwidth which is narrow for the gravity gradient data. The \n\nbandwidth allows an increased retention of the signal with short wavelength (high frequency) \n\ngenerated by shallow and intermediate geological features that are not retained in conventional \n\nground gravity data. This increased sensitivity allows a significant increase in the resolution of the \n\nanomalous bodies (Braga, 2006). \n\nEach tensor component of the gravity gradient corresponds exclusively to the size, shape, depth and \n\ndensity of the mass anomaly providing a constraint during the process of interpretation.  \n\nAll the five independent components are used in the process of interpretation for determining, for \n\nexample, the center of mass (Txz and Tyz), the edges of the body (Tyy and Txx) and the corner (Txy) \n\nof the structure that causes the anomaly. The Tzz component is the one that closely resembles the \n\nstandard gravity (Braga, 2006). But this is not always true. It can work very well for rectangular \n\nprism! \n\nIV.5.2. Tensor Rotation \n\nThe gravity gradiometry data are largely obtained in a fixed coordinate system NED, thereby, many \n\ngeological scenarios can produce enhanced imaging of the target features using alternative \n\ncoordinate systems. Dickson et al. (2009) presented the underlying transformation of the tensor in a \n\nrelatively simple process selecting a set of tensor components to be transformed, such that \n\n   \n                  IV-16 \n\n   \n                   IV-17 \n\n                   IV-18 \n\n   \n                       IV-19 \n\n      \n                        IV-20 \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n \n\n       \n  IV-21 \n\n   \n          \n\n  IV-22 \n\n\n\n \n\n \n69 \n\nwhere ? is the angle of rotation about the down axis. \n\nIn order to better understand the gravity gradients signal, we simulate the gravity field effect from a \n\nsimple rectangular prism model following the formulation given in Nagy et al. (2000). \n\n \n\nFigure IV-6: Anomalous mass represented by a rectangular prism with dimensions (?x, ?y, ?z) = (50,50,4) \n\nkm at an average depth of 4 km centered in the origin of the xy-plane of the north-east-down (NED) \n\ncoordinate system, which the positive x-axis correspond to north, which the positive y-axis correspond to \n\neast and positive z to down. \n\nFigure IV-6 shows the orientation and the dimensions of the simple prism hypothetically constucted \n\nto demonstrate the gravity gradient. The prism mass has a constant density (??) of 250 kg/m\n3\n and is \n\ncentered in the origin of the 100 km x 100 km grid of the xy-plane with average depth of 4 km with \n\nrespect to the north-east-down (NED) coordinate system. From the analysis of a single prism of \n\npositive density contrast, it is usually verified that the vertical component of the gravity anomaly \n\n(Tz) shows a diffuse circular anomaly centered on the prismatic body (Figure IV-7).  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n70 \n\n \n\nFigure IV-7: Example of the gravity gradients derived from anomalous mass (prism) with dimensions (?x, \n\n?y, ?z) = (50,50,4) km at an average depth of 4 km. The vertical gravity component Tz is displayed in the \n\nlower left corner together with schematic 3-D prism for viewing at depth. Gradients Tij (with i, j \n\nrepresenting the three axes x, y, z,) are plotted together with the white box in the xy-plane representing the \n\nlateral dimension of the 3D prism model. \n\nThe six gravity tensor components can be recovered from a gravity gradiometry survey providing a \n\npowerful tool to delineate the characteristics of the body. The gravity gradients are aproximatelly \n\nrelated to the edges, borders, corners and center of mass of the anomalous masses, which in this \n\ncase is a single prism model. The components were calculated on a xy-plane above the center of the \n\nprism (z = -4 km). Due to the symmetry, only the upper diagonal part of the gravity gradient tensor \n\nis shown in Figure IV-7. The Txx gradients highlight the x-axis (or east-west) edges of the prism by \n\nmeasuring the east-west changes in east-west gravity; the Tyy highlights the y-axis (or north-south) \n\nedges of the prism by measuring the north-south gravity trending boundaries. Tzz highlights all the \n\nedges of the anomaly, as it can be considered as a combination of Txx and Tyy with a sign change. \n\nTxz and Tyz gradient data outlines the north-south and the east-west mass anomaly axes, \n\nrespectively, containing the center of mass of the box. They also help to highlight the north-south \n\nand east-west edges. Although less intuitive, Txy shows distinctive circular anomalies associated \n\nwith the corners of the body. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n71 \n\n  \n\n  \n\nFigure IV-8: At the top the profiles AA' along x-axis to y = 0 are plotted together with the vertical \n\ncomponents of the gravity field (gravity anomaly ? Tz and gravity gradient ? Tzz, respectively). At the \n\nbottom the gravity field values (in the left) and the power spectrum (in the right) along the profile AA' show \n\nthe enhanced curve and resolution of the gravity field components Tz and Tzz. \n\nFigure IV-8 compares the gravity field values and the power spectrum on profile AA' for the gravity \n\nanomaly (vertical component - Tz) and the vertical gravity gradient (Tzz) caused by the same \n\nrectangular prism shown in Figure IV-6. It is clear by comparison in the profile that there is a \n\ngreater information level for the process of interpretation obtained from the Tz. However, there is a \n\ngreater sharpness and separation of the gravity gradient anomalies showing, in principle, a higher \n\nability to detect the prism edges.  \n\nThe power spectrum shows the steep curve of the Tzz gravity gradient component reflecting a \n\npossible improvement in the resolution of the observed field. The power spectrum suggests that the \n\nresolution of the gravity gradients improve significantly the capacity of detect the position of the \n\nanomalous mass (prism), i.e., the gravity gradients highlight better the anomalous body. \n\nAlthough the gravity tensor accurately maps subsurface density contrasts caused by the geologic \n\nstructures, the gravity gradients are often underused, as in the classic interpretation methods the Tzz \n\ncomponent is widely used. Thus, little attention is given to the horizontal components of the gravity \n\n\n\n \n\n \n72 \n\ntensor, that could be of great importance if it were represented in combination with the other \n\ncomponents in order to better identify the anomalous sources and the local geological setting. \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure IV-9: Representation of the gravity tensor using some invariances for highlight the anomalous mass, \n\naccording eqs. IV-8 to IV-15. \n\nIn most of the cases involving real gravity tensor data it is necessary to use the invariances to obtain \n\na best representation of the gravity tensor components via simultaneous combinations given by eqs. \n\nIV-8 to IV-22. Notice that the prism is clearly mapped (Figure IV-9) following the eqs. IV-8 to \n\nIV-15, respectively. \n\nOne notices also that the strike lineament technique obtained in Figure IV-9(e) would illustrate the \n\ndominant geological signature of the area if there exists a trend in a certain direction on the region. \n\nIn this case, a single prism, we are not able to see the trend because it doesn't exist in this \n\nhypothetical model. However, according to Murphy and Brewster (2007), the identification of the \n\nlineaments on geological structures is normally possible if the estimates of the strike directions at \n\neach point are assessed based on their geological significance and continuity along a line with a \n\nsimple rule of thumb. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n73 \n\n \n\nFigure IV-10: Response derived from hypothetical single prism model (dashed white box) in a rotated \n\ntensor coordinate system of 120 degrees about the x-axis, simulating a structural feature to be enhanced in \n\nthe northwest direction. \n\nThe tensor rotation (Figure IV-10) is recommended in some geological scenarios, producing an \n\nenhanced imaging of the target features (Dickson et al., 2009).  \n\nIt is apparent that the combined use of the gravity tensor components is able to define in some \n\nextent the geological setting of a region. These imaging techniques include the use of rotational \n\ninvariants, strike lineaments and rotations of the tensor coordinates. Thus, the correct application of \n\nthese techniques can help and improve the interpretation of the gravity gradient maps for \n\ngeophysical studies. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n74 \n\nCHAPTER V \n\nV. PROCESSING THE GOCE DATA \n\nThe GOCE mission is based on a sensor equipped with a GPS receiver for satellite-to-satellite \n\ntracking (SST-hl) in the high-low mode, plus a sophisticated satellite gravity gradiometry (SGG), \n\nproviding a huge data set consisting of millions of orbital data (derived from SST) and very precise \n\nin-orbit gravity gradiometry data (Sunkell, 2002). This data contain abundant information about the \n\nEarth's gravity field on a global scale, from very low to high frequencies. This gravity field \n\ninformation is represented by a set of spherical harmonic coefficients up to degree and order 250, \n\nwhich corresponds to a half wavelength of about 80 km of spatial resolution.  \n\nThere are only four GGs, Vxx, Vyy, Vzz and Vxz, with very high accuracy; Vxy and Vyz are less accurate \n\nas a consequence of the gradiometer configuration that consists of six three-axis accelerometers \n\nbeing two ultrasensitive axis and one less sensitive axis, built and tested on Earth in a 1-g \n\nenvironment (ESA, 1999). \n\nThe scientific processing of the GOCE data, known as Level 1b to Level 2 processing, is done by \n\nthe high-level processing facility (HPF), which is part of the GOCE Ground Segment (Koop et al. \n\n2007). This preprocessing stage get the Level 1b gravity gradients (GGs) derived from the \n\ngradiometer observations which have been calibrated in flight using satellite shaking and star sensor \n\ndata. After many transformations the data becomes EGG_TRF_2 L2 gravity gradients in LNOF (see \n\nAnnex A) with corrections externally calibrated in a local north-oriented frame, including \n\ncorrections due to the temporal gravity variations (e.g., ocean tides, pole tides, non-tidal) to isolate \n\nthe static gravity field part, outliers fill-in gravity gradients for data gaps with flags (if detected) and \n\ntheir GG error estimates (Koop et al., 2007; Gruber et al., 2009).  \n\nThe Level 2 gradients together with precise science orbits are derived as a global gravity field \n\nmodel, represented by spherical harmonic coefficients. In particular, the GGs may be directly used \n\nin Earth sciences, typically for geophysical/oceanographic applications focusing on smaller spatial \n\nscales (Koop et al. 2007), using the gravity gradients transformed from the GRF to the LNOF \n\nsystem (see frames system in GOCE satellite at ANNEX A) by HPF in GOCE level 2 Products, \n\nreleased as a Track_GO_CONS_EGG_TRF_2 file (Figure V-1). \n\nHowever, to use of the released EGG_TRF_2 Level 2 Products requires the extraction and \n\npreparation of all the additional correction needed to remove the GOCE GGs noise (shift/drift) in \n\ncrossover (XO) points (Figure V-2) due to the different orbit heights at each orbit of the satellite. In \n\n\n\n \n\n \n75 \n\nthis work, we have analyzed the 21 GOCE track files available in the study area to obtain such a \n\ncorrection using the crossover errors, and then we have removed a linear trend along the time, using \n\nstandard least-squares parameter estimation. \n\n \n\nFigure V-1: Track files coverage of the GOCE gradiometric data provided by GOCE level 2 products \n\ncovering the period from 10/2009 to 04/2011 (each bar corresponds to the time span of the orbit). \n\nGravity gradiometer data are normally affected by high-frequency noise originated from the \n\nmovement of the platform. Low pass filters are often applied to remove such motion-related noise. \n\nThe filtering, however, does not discriminate between signal and noise and removes both from \n\nfrequencies outside the pass band (Koop et al. 2007). The GOCE accelerometers are designed to \n\ngive the highest achievable precision in the measurement bandwidth (MBW) between 5 and 100 \n\nmHz, which corresponds to a resolution along track of 40-8000 km. The diagonal gravity gradients \n\nin LORF do not exceed the precision of 4 mE/?Hz in the MBW (Bouman et al., 2005). \n\nV.1. GOCE Satellite Track Cross-Overs \n\nThe cross-overs (XOs) technique has been applied very successfuly not only in satellite altimetry \n\nbut in other geophysical observations collected by oceanographic vessels, remotely-sensed data, \n\nairborne collection campaigns, or terrestrial measurements of various types obtained along criss-\n\ncross traverses. The crossovers allow to detect possible systematic temporal errors, and to check the \n\ninherent accuracy of the gradiometer system (Wessel, 1989; Bouman et al. 2005; Jarecki and \n\nM\u00fcller, 2008; Wessel, 2010). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n76 \n\nThe basic principle of crossover in order to remove a drift in GOCE gradiometric data sets follow \n\nthe steps described in Albertella (2000). Firstly identifying the satellite orbit crossovers, which do \n\nnot really exist three-dimensionally due to the orbit eccentricity, that do not allow repeated \n\nmeasurements, and then removing the strongly orientation-dependent character of the orbits, due to \n\nthe alignment of the satellite to be different on the ascendig and on the descending intersecting \n\ntracks. Therefore, these crossovers do not follow the simple concept of having data points collected \n\nat the same position in space, but they can be computed for the same position (?, ?) of the ground \n\ntrack on a two-dimensional reference defined by their projection at the surface (aproximated by a \n\nsphere).  \n\nAccording to Albertella (2000), the measurements    \n  of GOCE's gravity gradiometer should show \n\nno differences at the orbit crossovers: \n\n     \n        \n\n  V-1 \n\nwhere the indices i, j represent the three axes of gradiometer x, y, z, and the indices 1, 2 mean that \n\neach ground track crossover has been found by intersection of two ascending and descending tracks, \n\nhere obtained by the interpolation of seven or at least three data points along-track around the \n\nspecific crossover (Figure V-2) using the method of Akima (1972).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n77 \n\n  \n\nFigure V-2: Cross-over geometry of the SGG satellite tracks. Schematization of the satellite orbit cross-over \n\nin (a) \"the same position in 3D space\", (Modified from Bouman et al., 2005); and (b) the same geographical \n\nposition on a two-dimensional projection over the surface of the study area. \n\nThus, for each ground crossover, i.e. the same (geographical) position (?, ?), we can write \n\n                                \nV-2 \n\nAs already mentioned, due to the orbit eccentricity, the satellite altitude differs in those projected \n\npositions, causing the existence of height differences ?h12, that can be as high as ~13 km, causing \n\nmeasurement differences \"at the same point in space\" (crossovers) on the GOCE observations. \n\n                \nV-3 \n\n \n\nMoreover, the different orientation of the gradiometer axes along each ascending and descending \n\ntrack must be considered, which leads to further measurement differences by rotating the \n\nmeasurements or by applying a reduction: \n\n                   V-4 \n\n \n\nThe XO differences can be used, in principle, with any available gravity quantity, because the \n\nmeasured variables are theoretically equivalent, to reduce the discrepancies between the tracks. One \n\nTrack 2 ?h \n\nVxx1 \n\nVzz1 \n\nVyy1 \n\nVzz2 \nVxx2 \n\nVyy2 \n\n(a) \n\nTrack 1 \n\n\n\n \n\n \n78 \n\nmethod of doing this is to use modeled differences from simulated gravity gradients calculated from \n\nan existing geopotential model - e.g. EGM96, EGM2008 or EIGEN-GRACE. \n\nAccording to Jarecki et al. (2006), the reduction can be calculated as  \n\n                          \nV-5 \n\n \n\nAfter this reduction, the XO differences are: \n\n                              \nV-6 \n\nAs a reduction is necessary for compensating the height differences and in order to avoid a loss of \n\nquality in the measurements, we have used the reduction concept by linear trend estimation, and we \n\ndid not apply any spacial filter to preserve important frequencies in the full gradient signal. \n\nFollowing Bouman et al. (2005), we can use another way of reduction by introducing a model error \n\nin the crossovers calculated from external validation methods (using auxiliary data from a \n\ngeopotential model to simulate gravity gradients at the same position of the GOCE data points). \n\nThus, the height differences in the crossover points lead to measurement differences in the gravity \n\ngradients that should be reduced to the same reference height and to the same orientation of the \n\ngradiometer axes along each track by applying \n\n                                           V-7 \n\nwhere      is the derivative of the gradients in the vertical direction and      is the derivative with \n\nrespect to the satellite orientation, which can be computed from the geopotential models (e.g., \n\nEGM2008) by simple numeric differentiation together with the height        and direction        \n\ndifferences. \n\nHowever, as we have no information about the direction of the gradiometer axes from EGG_TRF_2 \n\nLevel 2 Products, we will apply a reduction obtained from the crossover differences analysis, which \n\ncan easily be estimated by the least-squares adjustment (linear trend) of the gravity gradient \n\ndifferences with respect to the time differences or to the height differences in the crossovers \n\nV.2. Linear Trend Estimation \n\nIn practice this is a technique based on the assumption that the geophysical field is continuous from \n\ntrack to track and along the track. Even though the geology may be variable, the observed data will \n\n\n\n \n\n \n79 \n\ntend to show significant correlations between the satellite orbit tracks. However, this method is only \n\nfeasible if the track is free of systematic errors (for instance, without misalignments of the \n\naccelerometers, leveling, scale factor mismatches, etc) for a reference satellite height. As it is \n\nknown that the orbit eccentricity makes the altitude of the satellite to be different at the crossing \n\npositions, it is necessary to use the crossover technique.  \n\nThe time stamped in each collected data point can be used for such a correction, since we have \n\nneglected the effects of the periodic errors (e.g. Fourier-type periodic disturbances), as discussed in \n\nJarecki and M\u00fcller (2008) and Koop et al. (2002). \n\nFollowing Koop et al. (2002), let    \n \n\n represent the geophysical field measurement differences, \n\nwhich are a function of the observed gradients and the standard error model for the external \n\ncalibration of the gradiometer measurements. This function can be constructed as  \n\n   \n         \n\n                \n     \n\n      V-8 \n\nwith    \n  considered as a constant bias corrupting the real gradients    \n\n ; however, applying the \n\ncrossover gradient differences, the constant bias cancels out, and reappears only in the magnitude of \n\nthe errors. The linear trend    \n  is the basic error feature. It projects linearly into the crossover \n\ndifferences (V-6), while the real gradient    \n  in the reoccupied position ?(t1) = ?(t2), ?(t1) = ?(t2): \n\n?   \n      \n\n         \n         \n\n             \n        V-9 \n\nThus, the crossover errors (or crossover differences ? ?   \n       \n\n ) can be expressed as a function \n\nof time t, f(t). The corrected measurements    \n \n, i.e., the difference between    \n\n \n and f(t), are \n\n   \n     \n\n        V-10 \n\nDue to the geophysical field to be continuous and correlated track to track and along-track, the \n\n'corrected' measurements    \n \n in each track point should match, so that the difference between the \n\ntwo measurements at the crossover should be minimal, \n\n    ?   \n       \n\n \n     V-11 \n\nOnce a model f(t) is selected, the XO error function f(t) can be determined from the crossover \n\ndifferences (i.e.,    \n      and    \n\n      associated with the time difference ?t = t1 ? t2) using standard \n\nleast-squares parameter estimation. The measurement    \n \n\n is corrected using equation V-11, where \n\n\n\n \n\n \n80 \n\nthe gradients serve as a new reference 'free of systematic errors along-track', and this procedure is \n\nrepeated for all along track point of the entire GOCE data set obtained (Figure V-1). \n\nThe success of the systematic trend correction in the GOCE data is given by a crossover error \n\nmodel that adjusts the    \n , which may not correspond to a geological meaningful model. For \n\ninstance, if f(t) in eq. (V-11) fits ?   \n \n\n perfectly, we have no crossing errors. Obviously this is \n\nphysically incorrect, as the orbit eccentricity do not allow exact repeated measurements in the \n\ncrossing positions. A Matlab program was elaborated to estimate the crossover errors along one or \n\nmore tracks fitting the measurements that best defines the crossover error model. \n\nThe simple model of a crossover error function f(t) in a polynomial form can be given by \n\n               \n       \n\n  V-12 \n\nwhere k is degree of polynomial and ak are the coefficients. The residual is given by \n\n        \n             \n\n       \n   \n\n \n \n\n   \n\n V-13 \n\nThe coefficients a = (a0,a1,...,ak)\nT\n can be resolved easily in a least-squares sense. For k = 1, the \n\nequation reduces to the linear solution. In this case, we assumed the crossover errors represent a \n\nlinear trend along the time. \n\nThe orbit of ground track in the along-track direction is provided from the EGG_TRF_2 Level 2 \n\nproducts at the altitude of about 250 km, with the position and GGs information with a sampling \n\nrate of 1 Hz. The main orbit characteristics are: major semi-axis 6628 km, inclination 96.6 and \n\neccentricity 0.001 (Jarecki and M\u00fcller, 2008). \n\nThe first step to obtain the cross-over correction was to break each EGG_TRF_2 products GOCE \n\nLevel 2 into smaller tracks generating new tracks equivalent to ascending or descending tracks. \n\nFigure V-3 shows, for instance, the ground tracks in the South America from GOCE Level 2 \n\nProducts (Track_GO_CONS_EGG_TRF_2__20110211T000000_20110228T235959_0001, see \n\nFigure V-1). The 18 days orbit of this test data comprises a time span from February 11 to February \n\n28, 2011, with 1 Hz sampling interval, and have been broken into ascending and descending tracks, \n\nresulting in 61 ascending and 61 descending tracks; 1332 crossovers were found into this test area \n\n(60\u00ba ? ? ? 18\u00ba in latitude and -86\u00ba ? ? ? -30\u00ba in longitude).  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n81 \n\nIn the same form, each GOCE gradiometric data set covering the period from 10/2009 to 04/2011 \n\n(Figure V-1) was splitted into new ascending and descending tracks that were stored in a database \n\nset and posteriorly checked for intersection. Thus, the whole GOCE gravity gradients data set in the \n\nstudy area have been analyzed using the satellite track crossovers. \n\nWhen we compare an ascending track with a descending track from the same GOCE data set (i.e. an \n\nunique GOCE track file) we get the so-called \u2018\u2018internal crossovers\u2019\u2019. The \u2018\u2018external crossovers\u2019\u2019 are \n\ncriss-cross points found when making the comparison of the ascending track with descending track \n\nfrom two different GOCE data sets (Figure V-1). \n\nOnce all XOs were found (internal and external) in the test area, we have estimated the linear trend \n\nand report the crossover error (COE) and mean values for all observables in the corrected track \n\nfiles. The values of the observations at the intersections are interpolated from the nearby along-track \n\nvalues using the specified linear, cubic, or Akima (1972) spline interpolator, and the reduction \n\nprocedures (such as long-term trend) are applied. The crossover information for each track pair is \n\nappended to a growing data file with all COE obtained to date. Here, we have used the Akima \n\nspline interpolation (Akima, 1972) to estimate the data values at the intersection points (i.e. to find \n\nthe crossover values) because it is a special spline which is stable to the outliers, in contrast, for \n\nexample, to the cubic spline, that can introduce spurious oscillations in the neighborhood of an \n\noutlier (Wessel, 2010). \n\nIn the test study area given by Figure V-3 representing South America for whole track files depicted \n\nin the Figure V-1 534.769 XOs points have been found, and the position, the GPS time, the satellite \n\nheight and the measured gradients were interpolated using the described procedure.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n82 \n\n \n\nFigure V-3: Satellite ground orbit based on the GOCE data track arc (blue and red lines represent \n\nthe ascending and descending tracks, respectively) from 18 orbit days acquired on February, \n\n2011 in a test area for the crossover analysis. \n\nThe results of the linear trends of the gravity gradients with respect to height differences ?h are \n\nshown in Figure V-4. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n83 \n\n \n\nFigure V-4: XO differences of the whole data set of GOCE level 2 products covering the period from \n\n10/2009 to 04/2011 (in 361 days) discussed in Figure V-1, showing a linear trend clearly visible from the \n\nleast-squares estimation. \n\nIn the Figure V-4 one can observe that the off-diagonal gradients measurements presented a nearly \n\nnoise-free signal. Therefore, we will apply the linear trend (k = 1 to eq. V-13) removal only for the \n\ndiagonal tensor components. \n\nFigure V-5 exhibits the tensor vertical component (Vzz), in the left, from EGG_TRF_2 GOCE data \n\nwithout the crossover correction and filtering MBW, and, in the right, the tensor vertical component \n\nderived from a geopotential model at a height of 250 km. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n84 \n\n \n\nFigure V-5: Comparison of the Vzz component from (a) EGG_TRF_2 products GOCE Level 2 data without \n\nXO errors removal and (b) from geopotential GOCE-only gravity model (Pail et al., 2011) up to degree and \n\norder 250 calculatade in the satellite altitude of 250 km. \n\nThe effect of the linear trend superposed to the GOCE data set was estimated directly from the \n\ncrossover differences by least-squares adjustment. As discussed in Jarecki and M\u00fcller (2008), the \n\neffects of the interpolation errors on crossovers can cause discrepancies of the original crossover \n\ndifferences. Nevertheless, it is recommended to use a more robust trend estimation method like the \n\none described in Jarecki and M\u00fcller (2008) and/or a trend estimation from a large set of XO \n\ndifferences time intervals for minimizing the effect of outliers (e.g., Table V-1).  \n\nThe assessment of the interpolation errors on the trend estimation for different time intervals is \n\nsummarised in Table V-1, considering that the investigated track sections were all in the study area \n\n(Figure V-3) and then the track data set for all terrestrial globe (Figure V-6) (only 1 and 11 days) \n\ndenominated \u201c1 revolution\u201d.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n85 \n\n \n\nFigure V-6: Covered on all Earth for 1 day track from GOCE Level 2 Products \n\nTrack_GO_CONS_EGG_TRF_2 at 31 October 2009.  \n\nTable V-1: Estimation of linear trends from XO gravity gradient differences (?Vzz) of the GOCE \n\ndata set using different combinations (in height variation) of the tracks in the test area and in the \n\nglobal area.  \n\ntrack section \n\ninvestigated \n\ncrossovers with tracks \n\nfrom \n\nestimated trend \n\nstd [mE/d] \n\n# samples (XOs) \n\n1 arc \n361 d (whole data set \n\nonly in study area) \n\n-1.228988 \n\n1.864492 \n\nca. 534.769 \n\n1 revolution 1 d (global area) \n\n-1.232420 \n\n0.0291720 \n\nca. 248 \n\n1 revolution 11 d (global area) \n\n-1.231484 \n\n0.029146 \n\nca. 28.425 \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n86 \n\n \n\nFigure V-7: Gravity gradients at the mean satellite height (h ? 250 km) from cross-over corrections. \n\nThe analysis of the results (Figure V-7) shows that the component Vxz seems to be less accurate than \n\nthe others gravity gradients components, and its values are almost 10 times greater than all the other \n\ncomponents. This observation will be discussed in the next chapters. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n87 \n\nCHAPTER VI \n\nVI. TOPOGRAPHIC CORRECTION \n\nIn an environment of irregular topography, the undulations of topography above and \n\nbelow the elevation level of a gravity observation point are referred as terrain \n\ncorrection. Terrain correction is necessary when the gravity effect due to topography \n\nbetween any station and the base station is over the accuracy of gravimeter (Forsberg, \n\n1984). \n\nTopographic and isostatic reductions are evaluated to eliminate the effects of the two \n\nmost dominant and best known density anomalies of the earth: the visible topography \n\nand its associated compensation at depth. Generally, such gravity field effects are \n\nnominated \"terrain effects\" (Forsber, 1984).  \n\nAccording Forsberg (1984), the term \"terrain corrections (TC)\" commonly applied will \n\nbe reserved for a correction to the Bouguer reduction, to give the true (unlinear) effect \n\nof the topography on gravity anomalies. \n\nHelmert (1884) proposed a few methods for mathematically computing a potential field \n\nwith no masses external to the geoid. The Stokes\u2019 integral requires also a gravitational \n\npotential with effect of the topographic masses above the geoid, as well as the isostatic \n\nbalance masses removed (i.e., topographic-isostatic reduction of gravity) (Heiskanen &amp; \n\nMoritz, 1967). Helmert\u2019s 2\nnd\n\n method of condensation removing the topographic masses \n\nand restores them on a condensed mass layer at the geoid and the attractive property of \n\nhaving a small indirect effect (Lambert 1930). Martinec (1998) said all existing \n\nHelmert\u2019s 2\nnd\n\n condensation approach in topographic effects use the concept of planar \n\napproximation of the geoid which describes the actual situation only very roughly. Only \n\nin Martinec (1993) begun to be studied in great detail to spherical effects. Smith et al. \n\n(2001) quantify the errors in using planar approximations and introduces spherical \n\nprism approach for terrain correction. \n\nGravity anomalies provide important constraints for determining the geological \n\nproperties and history of the Earth. The Gravity Missions by Satellite have also mapped \n\nthe gravity fields that provided insights on the Earth's internal mass properties. Already \n\nthe topographic reductions help differentiate free-air anomalies for components of \n\n\n\n \n\n \n88 \n\nuncompensated terrain and other crustal and subcrustal mass variations (Asgharzadeh et \n\nal., 2007).  \n\nThe modelling of topographic effects in gravity gradients as observed by Gravity Field \n\nand Steady State Ocean Circulation Explore (GOCE) is based on the numerical \n\nevaluation of functionals of Newton\u2019s integral extending over the domain of the \n\ntopographic masses which include the masses of the continents as well as the oceanic \n\nmasses. The GOCE gravity gradient mission launched in late 2009 is resolving further \n\ndetails of the Earth\u2019s gravity field to degree and order 250, until the present day, at \n\nroughly 250 km altitude. \n\nTC are needed in various applications such as geoid computation, interpretation of \n\ncrustal structure as well orthometric correction (Hwang et al., 2003). Most of these \n\nmethods are computed by algorithm based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and is \n\nsuitable for grid-wise computation. The other algorithm is based on the direct \n\nintegrations of the TC integrals and is ideal for point-wise computation (Hwang et al., \n\n2003). The most widely used method for terrain correction is the Hammer\u2019s method \n\n(Hammer, 1939), which many geophysicists are still using it for terrain correction. \n\nForsberg (1984) computed in effect of topographic masses by direct calculation of \n\nprisms deduced from the digital terrain model. Hwang et al., 2003 used a rigorous point-\n\nwise method that is based on Gaussian quadrature. Heck &amp; Seitz (2007) computed with \n\na tesseroid method. \n\nBeside the topographic and density information which define the geometry and mass of \n\nthe particular tesseroids, their spatial arrangement has to be fixed. Even though the used \n\ntesseroid formulas are given in a spherical manner, these bodies can be set up on \n\ndifferent reference surfaces approximating MSL (Mean Sea Level). Tesseroids are well \n\nsuited for the decomposition if the topography of the Earth is represented by a DTM \n\n(Digital Terrain Model) which is usually given in geographical coordinates. \n\nA much more effective approach analyzing gravity data over a finite spherical is to \n\nrepresent the anomalies by gravity effects of an equivalent point source distribution or \n\nrelated to the masses of a fixed distribution of gravity point poles by least-squares \n\ninversion (Asgharzadeh et al., 2007). Due the geological significance of the existing and \n\ngrowing volumes of regional (large scale) terrain elevation and satellite gravity data in \n\nstudy area, there is great need for computing theoretical anomalous gravity fields from \n\n\n\n \n\n \n89 \n\ngeological and geophysical models in spherical coordinates. For this, we used the \n\ntesseroids ? 1.1 software developed by Uieda (2011), which use the notion about \n\ntesseroid introduced by Anderson (1976), as described in Heck &amp; Seitz (2007) shown \n\npreviously in this thesis. \n\nThe topographic data used to the calculation of topographic reductions was from \n\nETOPO1 Global Relief Model, a global relief model of Earth's surface that integrates \n\nland topography and ocean bathymetry. The National Geophysical Data Center \n\n(NGDC) department of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) \n\nhas developed the ETOPO1 that was built from numerous global and regional data sets \n\nwith a 1 arc-minute resolution in order to improve the ETOPO2v2 Global Relief Model \n\n(Amante &amp; Eakins, 2008). \n\nThus the topographic data represented in the Figure VI-1 were used from ETOPO1 \n\nmodel with a grid 1 minute (Amante &amp; Eakins, 2008). \n\nJust as Heck &amp; Seitz (2007), for this calculation, the topographic surface of the Earth is \n\noften divided in spherical prism as described in Chapters previous and your calculate \n\ncombined effect of a list of tesseroids on given computation points from the tesseroids - \n\n1.1 Beta software by Uieda (2012).  \n\nThe calculation of the Gravity Gradient Tensor (GGT) and gravity anomaly (gz) due to \n\ntopographic masses using tesseroids was obtained from Digital Elevation Model (DEM) \n\nas such ETOPO1 model given on a resampled regular grid in 10' equal-spaced grid \n\ntogether with its corresponding density values. Here, for this method is assumed that the \n\nheights into and/or above sea level (reference level ? zero depth meter) signal land is \n\nconsidered to be the average terrain density 2.67 g/cm\n3\n and negative heights signal \n\nocean is considered the constant density of -1.64 g/cm\n3\n (i.e., the difference between the \n\nmean ocean saltwater density 1.03 g/cm\n3\n and the reference crustal density 2.67 kg/m\n\n3\n). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n90 \n\n-  \n\nFigure VI-1: Topography and bathymetry from ETOPO1 global relief model (Amante \n\n&amp; Eakins, 2008). \n\n \n\nFigure VI-2: Effect caused by topographic masses using tesseroids at 250 km altitude for \n\ngravity anomalies from resampled ETOPO1 DEM 10' grid. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n91 \n\n \n\nFigure VI-3: The resulting gravity effect on topography corresponding gravity gradients at \n\naltitude higher than regional height from resampled of the ETOPO1 DEM per 10 by 10 arc \n\nminute grid cell. \n\nAs described above the terrain correction to gravity field due the topographic masses \n\nirregularities can be estimated from geometric element used in the forward gravity \n\nmodelling processes such as prisms calculated from the Digital Terrain Model as \n\ncomputed by Forsberg (1984) relative to a smooth mean height surface. Here, the \n\ntopographic reduction in gravity anomaly and GGT is performed from the effect of \n\ntopographic masses by applying forward gravity modelling in space domain using \n\ntesseroids (See section III.3) deduced from ETOPO1 DEM at Earth's surface using a \n\nmean height level chosen to be higher than the regional topographic height. This is \n\nbecause the tesseroids-1.1 program does not guarantee the accuracy of the calculation at \n\n\n\n \n\n \n92 \n\nzero height (Uieda et al. 2011). So, for area in South America, 6570 m mean height was \n\nused for estimate topographic masses effect. Also, we calculate the same effect at 250 \n\nkm height cosidering that is the GOCE satellite mean height, which has been derived \n\nthe gravity field data. \n\n \n\nFigure VI-4: Effect caused by topographic masses using tesseroids at 250 km height for gravity \n\nanomalies from resampled of 10 arc-minutes ETOPO1 DEM. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n93 \n\nFigure VI-5: Effect caused by topographic masses using tesseroids at GOCE satellite height (h = \n\n250 km) for GGT from resampled ETOPO1 10' grid DEM. \n\nLikewise, we obtained gravity modelling from others geological targets as Moho and \n\nbasin sediments from seimological Moho thickness, depth and isopach models \n\ncomputing tesseroid masses and/or prism masses by LithoFlex program (Braitenberg et \n\nal., 2007) as discussed in next chapter. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n94 \n\nCHAPTER VII \n\nVII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  \n\nVII.1. Overview \n\nThe mantle densities seem to exert an important control on the formation of the basins \n\nand the study of the gravity field, the potential and the gradient tensor, coupled with the \n\nisostatic state of the lithosphere in the region, is an essential tool by which one can \n\nclassify these important structures (Braitenberg and Ebbing, 2007).  \n\nBecause of its large-scale size, the heavy coverage by tropical jungle, which limits the \n\naccess and acquisition of geophysical measurements and geological parameters, little \n\ndetailed and reliable information is available about the Amazon and Solim\u00f5es Basin, \n\none of the greatest geological domains of South America, located at the northern part of \n\nBrazil. Thus, coupled the lack of good terrestrial gravity data the Amazon and Solim\u00f5es \n\nBasin profit greatly from the gravity satellites. The recent GOCE satellite mission, \n\nwhith gradiometry on board, contributes greatly to improve the available gravity field, \n\nconsequently, is of fundamental importance to characterize adequately the region. In \n\nthis study, spherical coordinates have been used in the calculations of the gravity field \n\npotential from EGM2008 (Pavlis et al., 2012) and GO_CONS_GCF_2_TIM_R3 (Pail et \n\nal., 2011) GGMs published in terms of spherical harmonics according to what was \n\ndiscussed and recommend in APPENDIX A. \n\nThe models associated to the gravity field are composed of different wavelengths that \n\nrepresent the density variations on different depths within the Earth. Therefore, the \n\ngeoid or the observed gravity acceleration (and its derivatives) can be separated into \n\ndifferent wavelengths by approximations used commonly in the regional-residual \n\nseparation of gravity anomalies for exploration uses. \n\nBowin (1983) showed that there is an approximate relation between the spectral content \n\n(information about wavelength) of the geoid and the depth of the anomalous mass \n\nwhich generates a particular wavelength. Similarly, the gravity anomaly corresponding \n\nto the same anomalous point can also be derived. Therefore, the relationships can be \n\ncombined to obtain a boundary depth at which a mass distribution can exist to create the \n\nobserved gravity and geoid anomalies in the earth's surface. Using spectral relationships \n\n\n\n \n\n \n95 \n\nin the spherical harmonic representation of the free-air anomaly and geoid height, one \n\ncan produce an estimate of the maximum depth of the anomalous masses as a fraction of \n\nthe Earth's radius depending on the spherical harmonic degree. \n\nThe sedimentary basins may be correlated with the geoid, but this is not always the \n\ncase. This discrimination points towards different density characteristics in the \n\nintegrated crustal column (Braitenberg and Ebbing, 2007). Other important observation \n\nconstrained to the evolution of big sedimentary basins is the presence of volcanic \n\nstructures at some time-stage and at some depth at the basins. In particular, the brazilian \n\nAmazon, Solim\u00f5es and Parna\u00edba Paleozoic basins present a broad area where sill \n\nintrusions are frequent, and they might have a thickness of up to 500 m and an estimated \n\nvolume intruded into sediments of about 240,000 km\n3\n, probably related to the break-up \n\nof South America and Africa (Wanderley Filho et al., 2006).  \n\nVariations in the crustal thickness of large regions are usually attributed to downward \n\ndeflection beneath the basin if it is associated with the load-driving subsidence within \n\nthe crust. Furthermore, important observations in these basins are related to the \n\ndeviation of the observations from the classic isostatic equilibrium model, that predicts \n\nthe crustal thickness exclusively from the topographic and sedimentary loads. Instead of \n\ncrustal thinning, a high density mass distribution in the crust and upper mantle appears \n\nto be a typical feature present in these large structures, that may be caused by a mean \n\ndensity distribution of the intruded material or a partial replacement of the lower crust \n\nby mantle material, continental underplating, or passive upwelling of partial melt during \n\nrifting and extension of the lithosphere (Braitenberg and Ebbing, 2007; Nunn and Aires, \n\n1988). \n\nIn this case, isostatic gravity anomalies that can be modeled by an equivalent to the Airy \n\nmodel can be used to identify additional crustal loads, indicating under-compensation if \n\na positive isostatic gravity anomaly is found or an over-compensation otherwise, as the \n\nzero isostatic anomaly corresponds to the isostatic equilibrium. The isostatic models are \n\ncalculated for considering either crustal or sub-surface loads, the latter constituted by \n\nsediments and intruded material of high density such as diabase sills and dykes.  \n\nVII.2. Model Validation \n\nThe sediment thickness map (Figure VII-1a) in the continental areas was obtained from \n\nthe data base of Bizzi et al. (2004) (basement depth underlying the sedimentary \n\n\n\n \n\n \n96 \n\npackage); where not available the sediment thickness was hand-digitized using an \n\nisopach map from de Matos and Brown (1992),Wanderley Filho et al. (2005) and Eiras \n\nand Wanderley Filho (2006) and/or from the global sediment map digitized on a 1\u00b0 x 1\u00b0 \n\nscale (Laske and Masters, 1997). In the oceans the digital global sediment thickness \n\nmodel published by the NOAA at National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) with a \n\ngrid spacing of 5 arc-minutes by 5 arc-minutes (Divins, 2003) was used, although we \n\nwill not go into details in this thesis, as our interest area is only in the Amazon and \n\nSolim\u00f5es Basins.  \n\nThe density contrast used for the sedimentary basin rocks was defined relative to the \n\nreference continental crust density 2670 kg/m\n3\n was considered to be between the \n\nbasement and the sedimentary rocks ranging from 150 to 370 kg/m\n3\n considering the \n\nincreasing of the sedimentary package thickness (i.e., correspondent to the increase in \n\ndensity values from 2300 to 2520 kg/m\n3\n with increase of the sediment thickness). As \n\nreported in Nunn and Aires (1988), we have also assumed a average density model of \n\nthe sedimentary rocks 2550 kg/m\n3\n. For ocean sediments, we have assumed an average \n\ndensity about 2300 kg/m\n3\n (Fischer et al., 1996) (Figure VII-1). \n\n \n\nFigure VII-1: Forward gravity modellig for sediment package and diabase sills from our \n\n\n\n \n\n \n97 \n\nassumed density models. (a) sediment thickness from Bizzi et al. (2004); (b) gravity effect in \n\nsediments; (c) gravity effect in diabase sills; (d) gravity effect sills plus sediment. P.s: gravity \n\neffect is calculated from forward modelling using tessroids. \n\nWe have also simulated the low density basin sediments being intruded by a denser \n\nmaterial, reproducing the diabase sills and dykes reported in Wanderley Filho et al. \n\n(2006), that postulate that the crust has been intruded by denser material with a density \n\nof 3000 kg/m\n3\n beneath the basin, attributing the density to the 'intruded material' as \n\nbeing the same of the Cambrian age pyroxenite body drilled beneath the north-central \n\npart of the Amazon basin (according to Nunn and Aires, 1988) in order to explain the \n\nobserved positive gravity anomalies in the basin region. \n\nThe fact of the high gravity anomalies being coincident, nearly, with the axis of the \n\nsyneclise, suggesting shallow ultra-basic bodies, together with the underlying \n\naulacogenic strata, led to the classic interpretation of a rifting mechanism as the initial \n\ndriving mechanism for the subsidence of the Amazon Basin, according to Milani and \n\nZal\u00e1n (1999); so, we also have simulated diabase sills that lie into the sedimentary \n\nbasins. For this, we replaced the load of low-density sediments by higher-density \n\nmaterial with a density of 3000 kg/m\n3\n for an average thickness of 500 m in the basins \n\naxis (Figure VII-1c). Figure VII-2 represents the contribution of the sediments and the \n\nsills into the basin system. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n98 \n\nFigure VII-2: Gravity components along the profile A-A' that transects the Amazon Basin. See \n\nprofile location plotted in Figure VII-3. \n\nIn order to calculate the forward model by the tesseroids program already described in \n\nthe previous chapters, we have calculated the grids of the density distribution and \n\nthickness of the sediments, as shown in Figure VII-1. \n\nIn the same way, we also have calculated the gravity effect of the crustal thickness. The \n\nresults from Lloyd et al. (2010) indicate that the seismological Moho is thicker beneath \n\nthe central axis of the Amazon basin, flanked by a slightly thinner crust which becomes \n\nto be thicker towards the northwest and southeast of the Guyana and Guapor\u00e9 shields, \n\nindicating that the load-driving subsidence of the Amazon Basin can be within the crust, \n\nwhich is in agreement with the observed positive anomaly at the center of the basin.  \n\nThese authors have considered a crustal density model with an intruded crustal material \n\nof density 3000 kg/m\n3\n, and so the response in the observed gravity is a positive anomaly \n\ncaused by this crustal load. However, the positive gravity signal from Moho is broader \n\nthan the positive gravity anomaly observed at the center of the basin. \n\nIn order to obtain the representative response of the crustal and upper mantle structures, \n\nthe geoid undulations were calculated with GOCE satellite-only GGM (Pail et al., 2011) \n\nup to degree 250, and the longest wavelength contribution was removed by subtracting \n\nthe degrees smaller than 10 degree in the spherical harmonic expansion (Figure VII-4a). \n\nThis reduction corresponds approximatelly to subtracting the components of the gravity \n\nfield with wavelengths greater than 2000 km in the mid-latitudes (Braitenberg &amp; Ebbing \n\n2007).  \n\nThe Bouguer anomaly (Figure VII-3a) derived from the GGM (Pail et al., 2011) has \n\nbeen corrected to remove the effect of the topographic masses estimated from forward \n\ngravity modelling using tesseroids (see section III.3) with the ETOPO1 DEM data; this \n\nmodelling used a mean height level chosen to be higher than the regional topographic \n\nheight, as shown in chapter V. The Bouguer anomaly so obtained has also been \n\nanalyzed in comparison with terrestrial data where available (Figure VII-3b).  \n\nFurthermore, the Bouguer gravity anomaly was also calculated in a simplified form \n\nfrom the geopotential model (Figure VII-3c), subtracting the attraction of the Bouguer \n\nplate (2?G?H) from the classical gravity anomaly. This approximation for the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n99 \n\ntopography-reduced gravity anomaly is calculated by using the spherical approximation \n\nwith the topographic heights H calculated from the model DTM2006 used up to the \n\nsame maximum degree as the gravity field model (Barthelmes, 2009, eqs. 107 and 126). \n\nThe simple Bouguer gravity anomaly was used for H ? 0 (rock with density constrast ? \n\n= 2670 kg/m\n3\n), and for H &lt;0 (water with density contrast ? = (2670?1025) kg/m\n\n3\n, \n\naccording Barthelmes, 2009). This simplified model of the Bouguer anomaly has been \n\ncalculated from the facilities available at the International Centre for Global Earth \n\nModels (ICGEM). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n100 \n\n \n\nFigure VII-3: Representation of the Bouguer gravity anomaly in different aspects: (a) gravity \n\nanomaly calculated by tesseroids without the topographic effects; (b) Bouguer anomaly from \n\nthe available terrestrial measurements; and (c) Bouguer gravity anomaly calculated in spherical \n\n\n\n \n\n \n101 \n\nharmonics removing the Bouguer plate effect from the classic gravity anomaly.   \n\nThe Bouguer anomaly represents mainly the crustal sources and provides an outline for \n\nthe crust thickness variations in younger tectonic areas. In the case of cratonic areas, the \n\nbase of the crust is expected to show little variation and features observed in the \n\nBouguer anomaly maps should be mainly caused by the density variations in the crust \n\nand upper mantle (Braitenberg &amp; Ebbing 2007).  \n\n \n\nFigure VII-4: (a) Geoid calculated by harmonic expansion up to degree and order 250; (b) geoid \n\ncalculated by harmonic expansion up to degree and order 10; (c) Residual geoid, being the \n\ndifference (a)-(b); (d) gravity anomaly - free-air (mGal) calculated by harmonic expansion up to \n\ndegree and order 250; (e) free-air anomaly (mGal) calculated by harmonic expansion up to \n\ndegree and order 10 (f) Residual free-air anomaly (mGal) on Amazon and Solim\u00f5es Basins, \n\nbeing (d)-(e). Data: GO_CONS_GCF_2_TIM_R3 (Pail et al., 2011). \n\nThe Figure VII-5 depicts the Bouguer anomaly along the profile AA' crossing the \n\nAmazon basin. The Solim\u00f5es and Amazonas basins stretch for over 3000 km in the \n\nwest-east direction and approximately 500 km in the north-south direction, where the \n\nsediments reach the thickness of 5,000 to 6,000 meters (Silva, 1987); in the Parna\u00edba \n\nBasins this thickness reaches 3,400 m (Caputo et al. 2005).   \n\nThe Bouguer anomaly map displays a chain of gravity highs about +30 mGal to +60 \n\nmGal over the basin, roughly coinciding with the maximum thickness of sedimentary \n\n\n\n \n\n \n102 \n\nrocks, and therefore, it should outline the most central part (the trough) of the Amazon \n\nBasin. However, the gravity highs are flanked by gravity lows of -40 \u00b1 20 mGal, \n\ncoinciding with a thicker crust region, as reported by Lloyd et al. (2010) (Figure VII-7). \n\nThe relatively high values of the Bouguer anomaly in the region of the basin indicate a \n\ncrustal thinning or thickening of the crust and/or upper mantle, since the sediments \n\nwould contribute to lower the signal of the Bouguer anomaly (Figure VII-2).  Thus, if \n\nrelatively high values of the Bouguer anomaly are observed, there must be either a \n\nshallower Moho or a crustal/upper mantle densification, to balance the negative signal \n\nproduced by the sediments. This is the situation observed in the Amazon basin region. \n\nHowever, there is a lateral shift when we compare the position of the maximum Moho \n\nthickness beneath the basin and the position of the maximum Bouguer anomaly (Figure \n\nVII-5). \n\n \n\nFigure VII-5: Profiles of the Bouguer anomalies presented in Figure VII-3 in comparison with \n\nthe modeled crustal thickness.  \n\nThe Figure VII-6(a) shows the gravity disturbance calculated by the GOCE satellite-\n\nonly model (Pail et al. 2011) up to degree and order 250, and one can see, for example, \n\nthat the gravity disturbance provides a more detailed map, but the delineated features \n\nare similar to those found in the gravity anomaly maps (Figure VII-4d), since the \n\nmagnitude of the gravity disturbance is directly related to the disturbing potential, and, \n\n\n\n \n\n \n103 \n\nin turn, the gravity anomaly can be expressed as a linear combination of the disturbing \n\npotential and its normal derivative (Heiskanen &amp; Moritz, 1967).  \n\nThe maps showing the components of the deflection of the vertical (Figure VII-6b and \n\nc) present the north-south and east-west variations resulting from heterogeneities within \n\nthe Earth. As seen in previous maps, the sediment thickness in the Solim\u00f5es and \n\nAmazon Basin is characterized by these components. These quantities appear more \n\nneatly in the region of the Parna\u00edba Basin, identifying, for instance, in the meridian \n\ncomponent, the east-west variations that mark the sedimentary rocks of the Parna\u00edba \n\nBasin. As well, we can also find tectonic structures such as the Vilhena Arch and \n\ngravity anomalies in Parecis Basin caused by sedimentary rocks deposited during \n\nCretaceous. \n\nSome authors (Bizzi et al., 2004) have postulated the division of the Parna\u00edba Basin into \n\nfour sub-basins (Parna\u00edba, Alpercatas, Graja\u00fa and Espig\u00e3o-Mestre basins) that \n\noriginated from successive basins/cycles, but this subject will not be investigated in the \n\npresent work. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n104 \n\n \n\nFigure VII-6: (a) Gravity disturbance; Deflection of the vertical components: (b) the meridian \n\neast/west (?) components and (c) the prime vertical or north/south (?). Data obtained from \n\nGO_CONS_GCF_2_TIM_R3 model  (Pail et al., 2011). \n\nThe crustal thickness values were derived by Lloyd et al. (2010) from receiver functions \n\n(RF) from 20 temporary broadband seismic stations deployed across the eastern Brazil, \n\nincluding teleseismic and some regional events that provided the earthquake data for the \n\nRF analysis. This study has suggested that the Moho depth and the Moho relief vary \n\nslightly with the age within the Precambrian crust, and has also revealed an anomalous \n\ndeep Moho beneath the oldest core of the Amazonian Craton. \n\nThese results about the variations in depth of the crust/mantle boundary (Moho) show \n\nthe consistency of the gravity low and the other values already obtained with \n\n\n\n \n\n \n105 \n\nseismological stations within the study area. The result can be interpreted by the \n\npresence of a thinner crust towards the north of the study area, albeit the absence of \n\nmore stations in the northern part of the craton does not permit the conclusion of the \n\nexistence of a possible crustal thinning, and even if it exists, it is not evident whether it \n\nfollows to the north direction or stays just under the intracratonic basin. Note that Moho \n\ndepth thicknes along a NW-SE trend (exactly as the direction of the profile AA', which \n\nis centered on this anomaly) going through the shields and the Amazon basin, which \n\ncovered an area coinciding to the portions of the Central Amazonian and Ventuari-\n\nTapajos Provinces. \n\nAccording to Lloyd et al. (2010), the Vp/Vs ratio is smaller in the eastern part, \n\nsuggesting a differentiated lower crust of the central part of the Amazon Craton. Or \n\nrather, the Moho anomaly is weaker in the Amazon Basin compared to adjacent shields. \n\nThe  crustal thickness of the Amazon Craton is greater than 50 km towards the east of \n\nthe Guyana shield increasing continuously through the Amazon Basin within the \n\nCentral Brazil shield, and a high density in the lower crust or upper mantle must be \n\ntaken into account. \n\nIndeed, the northern region of Brazil has deficiency about information on crustal \n\nthickness (Moho depth) and Poisson's ratio (Vp/Vs). Such information is of great \n\nimportance for characterizing the area and further to assist in the improvement of the \n\ncalculated models for the region. \n\nThe Amazon and Solim\u00f5es basins follow the types of deep basins with the presence of a \n\nlinear gravity high that can reach +50 mGal. The explanation given by Nunn &amp; Aires \n\n(1988) for this signal is a supposed rift aborted below the basin. Currently, it is known \n\nthat the rifts below the Amazon, Solim\u00f5es and Parna\u00edba Paleozoic interior basins have \n\nin their sediments intrusions of  diabase sills and dykes, mainly in the form of sills, in an \n\nevent known as Penatecaua Episode during late Triassic to early Jurassic (Wanderley \n\nFilho et al. 2006). \n\nThe geoid height in the Parna\u00edba Basin reveals a large-scale residual variation, but it \n\ndoes not show a clear correlation with the basin itself. In contrast, a correlation is \n\nobserved in the Amazon basin (Figure VII-4). \n\nThe geoid undulations (Figure VII-4a) for the basins show greater variability, but even \n\nwith the good correlation found within the basins by Braitenberg &amp; Ebbing (2007), the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n106 \n\ntopographic effect, the sedimentary loads, and the high density in the lower crust and/or \n\nupper mantle appear to contribute to this variability in the geoid signature of these \n\nstructures. \n\n \n\nFigure VII-7: (a) Moho depth map (crustal thickness) in the Solim\u00f5es, Amazonas Basin \n\n(from Lloyd et al. 2010) and the (b) gravity anomaly from it. \n\nIndeed, we have found a pronounced low in the residual geoid in the basins studied in \n\nthis work, as shown in Figure VII-4c, that displays a clear correlation between the geoid \n\nsignature and the area of greatest crustal thickness (Figure VII-7), coinciding with the \n\nTapaj\u00f3s-Parima and Central Amazon provinces in the Amazon Craton (purple dashed \n\nline in the figure), as proposed from a geochronological model (Bizzi et al., 2004, see \n\nFigure II-3). \n\nIn Figure VII-8 and Figure VII-9 we present all the five independent components of the \n\ngravity gradient tensor used in the interpretation process in Earth's surface and satellite \n\nheight, respectively. The combinations of these gravity gradients are used to calculate \n\nthe anomalous signature invariants, shown in Figure VII-10. \n\nThe rates of change of each gravity component in relation to the change in the position \n\nin the three coordinate directions were also obtained by calculating the second \n\nderivative of the gravity disturbance component obtained from the \n\nGO_CONS_GCF_2_TIM_R3 model (Pail et al. 2011).    \n\n\n\n \n\n \n107 \n\n \n\nFigure VII-8: Gravity tensor components from GOCE only-satellite from \n\nGO_CONS_GCF_2_TIM_R3 (Pail et al. 2011).

(d), (e) and (f) are the same previous definitions however for the GOCE \n\nsatellite height at 250 km. \n\nFigure VII-8 shows that the gradient tensor components have a good correlation with \n\nthe structures present in the surface, as indicated by the geological studies of the region. \n\nHowever, as we don't have significant information about the subsurface geology, it is \n\nquite difficult to analyze the data from the individual components of the gravity gradient \n\ntensor, but the combination of the gradient components in invariants quantities (also \n\ncontroversy, the inavariants are contested and taken as filters) may bring an \n\nimprovement to the interpretation of the gravity tensor data (Figure VII-10). Already, \n\n\n\n \n\n \n110 \n\nthe Figure VII-9 seems to emphasize the deeper tectonic structures of the lower crust \n\nand/or upper mantle. \n\nThe amplitude of the horizontal gradient on the Amazon Basin in Figure VII-10a shows \n\nan elongated trend in the ENE-WSW direction, bounded on the north and on the south \n\nby the Guyana and Brazilian shields, respectively, on the east by the Gurup\u00e1 Arch, and \n\non the west by the Purus Arch, that are large structures pointed out by many authors \n\n(Nunn &amp; Aires, 1988; Wanderley Filho, 1991; Wanderley et al. 2005). While the \n\namplitude of the horizontal gradient on the Amazon Basin at 250 km height, in Figure \n\nVII-10d, shows also a anomaly elongated in the ENE-WSW direction, however broader, \n\nstretching for all Amazon basin which can be representative of the deeper structures. \n\nThe analytical signal Figure VII-10b can help in the interpretation of deeper sources, \n\nand in the study region it seems to highlight the structural hinges on the floor of the \n\nbasin aligned roughly parallel to the northern and southern margins, which are separated \n\nby lower relative subsidence zones (the so-called north and south platforms or shields) \n\nin relation to the deepest intermediary sector, i.e., the central trough, where the majority \n\nof the sedimentary rocks are from Paleozoic age, reaching depths that can exceed 5,000 \n\nm, as described by Cunha et al. (1994).  \n\nFigure VII-10c can be interpreted as the magnitude of the curvature of the gravity field, \n\nwhich strongly emphasizes the effects of shallower sources; in this case, it can be \n\nassociated with outcrops and sediments of the Amazon Basin that are restricted to the \n\nedges of the basin, in areas where the rock packages are cut crosswise by drainage, or \n\nelse some neo-Paleozoic quarries mining limestone, also located in the marginal zones \n\nof the basin (Cunha et al., 1994). \n\nObviously, only the interpretation of the gravity field elements is not feasible to \n\ncharacterize all the structure of these complex basins. This task only can be \n\naccomplished by the joint interpretation of the structural maps, seismic data, Bouguer \n\nanomaly, magnetic anomaly and isopach charts discussed in a few published studies or \n\neven limited to internal reports of companies bound to the exploitation of hydrocarbons \n\nsuch as Petrobras (for example, Aires, 1984; Linsser, 1958; Ara\u00fajo, 1972; Oliveira and \n\nCastro, 1971; apud Wanderley Filho et al., 2005).  \n\nAccording to Wanderley Filho et al. (2005), the major NW-SE faults existent in the \n\nAmazon Basin, denominated Jari-Pacaja\u00ed, Paru-Anapu, Faro-Juruti and Manacapuru-\n\n\n\n \n\n \n111 \n\nRio Negro, remained active at least until the Tertiary. They bisect and displace the \n\ndepocenter of almost all the lithostratigraphic units and the axis of the positive gravity \n\nanomalies. It is postulated that the NW-SE movement would not surpass the \n\nCarboniferous. These authors postulate that analyzing the isopach maps of the Permo-\n\nCarboniferous and Cretaceous-Tertiary Sequence, one can perfectly identify the \n\ninfluence of the transversal lineaments to the basin. \n\nIt's possible to detect positive gravity anomalies in the Iquitos, Purus and Gurup\u00e1 Archs, \n\nas well as in Vilhena and Serra Formosa Archs in the Parecis Basin, Ferrer-Urbano \n\nArch in the Parna\u00edba Basin and Tocantins-Araguaia Lineament limiting the Parna\u00edba \n\nProvince to the west with the Tocantins Province. Among the large features are Purus \n\nand Gurup\u00e1 Arches, and edge-faults mainly in the Amazon Basin.  \n\nPurus Arch is a structural element oriented in the NW-SE direction, separating the \n\nAmazon and the Solim\u00f5es basins, and it can be easily characterized in the gravimetric \n\nmaps derived from GOCE satellite-only model. In the gravimetric map this arch \n\ncorresponds to a minimum Bouguer anomaly indicating that there is a thick sedimentary \n\npackage below it, which was evidenced by well drillings. In the region of the arch, the \n\nbasin basement consists of Middle Proterozoic sediments (Prosperan\u00e7a formation). The \n\nGurup\u00e1 Arch is a structural element with direction NW-SE defining the boundary \n\nbetween the Amazon Basin and the Maraj\u00f3 Graben. This feature is clearly identified \n\nfrom the seismic interpretation and borehole data (Wanderley filho et al. 2005), and also \n\nfrom the gravimetry data (Figure VII-4, Figure VII-6 and Figure VII-8).  \n\nWe have obtained a new representation of the gravity field by applying a topographic \n\ncorrection to the data calculated at the altitude of the GOCE satellite. This procedure \n\ninvolves the calculation of the equivalent free-air anomaly derived from the \n\ngeopotential model (Pail et al., 2011) at the height of 250 km. After that, the \n\ntopographic masses effect at 250 km was removed, so that, a \"Bouguer anomaly \n\nequivalent\" at 250 km was obtained. \n\nOne should notice that the anomalous gravity low in the northern of the Amazon craton \n\n(Guyana Shield) highlights the Marioni-Itacaiunas and Central Amazonian structures, as \n\ndefined in Cordani et al. (2007). Other structure that is well delineated is the \n\ncontinuation of the Amazonian Province into the Brazil Shield.  This suggests that these \n\nstructures, which are nowadays separated by sedimentary basins, have deeper \n\n\n\n \n\n \n112 \n\ncorresponding parts. This may corroborate the assumptions that these blocks, indeed, \n\nare separated in the Amazon Basin region, where there may have been a transcurrent \n\nmovement, as described in Lobato (2011). Another obtained model, correspondent to \n\nthe terrain reduction for the Vzz gravity component on the Earth's surface and at the \n\nsatellite altitude, also highlights these structures, and may be detecting some anomalous \n\nmass distributions present in the lower crust and/or upper mantle in that region.  \n\nThe isostatic anomaly model representing the mantle and crustal masses also shows this \n\npattern, corroborating the idea of a crust thickening due to the possible movement of the \n\nmolten magma rising from the mantle into the basin during the opening of the South \n\nAtlantic, what should have reactivated the pre-existent weakness zones, permitting the \n\nrelative movements of these large blocks. \n\n \n\nFigure VII-11: (a) An \u201cequivalent Bouguer anomaly\u201d at the height of 250 km; (b) The \n\ngravity isostatic model; (c) Vzz calculated at the height of the GOCE satellite (250 km) \n\nand (d) Vzz calculated at the surface (both (c) and (d) corrected for the effect of the \n\ntopographic masses in the respective height).  (Dotted white lines show the probable \n\nstructures of the mantle inferred in the present study) \n\n\n\n \n\n \n113 \n\nThis result shows that the Vzz component corrected for the effect of the terrain permitted \n\nto highlight the edges of the main cratons and provinces within the study area. The \n\nisostastic anomaly shows that the area should be slightly in equilibrium for all \n\nAmazonian craton, but there might be a large structure in the lower crust and upper \n\nmantle around the northern and southern part of the Amazon Basin where the \n\ntopographic loads should be overcompensated (this can be inferred from the positive \n\nanomalies that exist in these regions). \n\nThis anomalous pattern follows its exposures straddle along a NW-SE trend \n\napproximately 2100 km long and 800 km wide involving parts of Brazil, Suriname, \n\nGuyana and Venezuela coinciding to the western and east portions, respectively, of the \n\nCentral Amazonian and Ventuari-Tapajos Provinces into Amazonian Craton (as defined \n\nby Cordani and Teixeira, 2007 in Figure II-4). \n\nVII.3. Challenges and Limitations \n\nThe challenges in the methodology used in this work came from the possibility of \n\napplying the principle of Satellite Gravity Gradiometry (SGG) in the study of large \n\nsedimentary basins. The SGG collected by the GOCE Mission with a tri-dimensional \n\n(3-D) gradiometer aims to measure the gravity gradient components of the Earth\u2019s \n\ngravity field, providing a new regional aspect for the most accurate global geopotential \n\nmodels, and important along-tracks measurements at the height of approximately 250 \n\nkm. \n\nThis task for itself is already a challenging one, and, additionally, we had a delay in the \n\navailability of the along-track gravity gradients measured by the GOCE satellite due to \n\nthe (successive) delay in the launching of the GOCE mission. As an alternative, we had \n\nto work with the existing geopotential models obtained from data of other gravity \n\nmissions, such as the GRACE mission. When the Level 2 Products became available, \n\nthere were many problems to the preparation of the GOCE data, since the GOCE Level \n\n2 Product Data was in XML data files (EGG_NOM_2) and had to be converted into \n\nASCII files or equivalent, to be adequately processed. The analysis and the processing \n\nof these huge quantity of data for searching and calculating the corrections for the \n\ncrossovers errors was a very complicated task, and demanded a lot of (precious) time in \n\nthe present work, as it should demand in the future in any work involving these valuable \n\ndata.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n114 \n\nVII.4. Significant Contributions and Insights \n\nThe first contributions of the present work were added to the original work flow of the \n\nthesis due to the delay in the launching and in the calibration of the GOCE mission, and \n\nconsisted in an important aspect: the comparison of the main available Global Gravity \n\nModels (for example, EGM2008 (Pavlis et al., 2008)) in the study area with the \n\navailable terrestrial data, that has detailed and accurate information on the short-\n\nwavelength part of the field. After the release of the first reliable GOCE models (Pail et \n\nal., 2011), this analysis was extended to these models, helping in evaluating areas where \n\nthe terrestrial data has problems (See more details in Appendix A). \n\nAfter the release of the Level 2 products, the original research proposal could be \n\nrevisited, and the results so obtained showed that the use of this kind of data can \n\ncontribute to the improvement of the understanding of the solid Earth processes, in \n\nparticular those that occur in the lithosphere and the upper mantle underlying large \n\nsedimentary basins. \n\nVII.5. Recommendations for Future Research \n\nThe upward continuation of the TGG data reduces the effects of noise and density \n\nvariations near the Earth's surface (that are caused mainly by the attraction of the Earth's \n\ntopographic and/or isostatic masses), and it improves the representation of the gravity \n\nfield from mass heterogeneities signals present in deeper anomalous sources, like the \n\nlower crust and the upper mantle.  \n\nOne approach that could be recommended involves the inverse process, consisting in \n\nanalyzing the gravity gradients measured by GOCE mission, at the satellite height \n\n(about 250 km), in order to obtain the equivalent values of these quantities referenced to \n\nthe mean sea level (MSL). This is not a trivial task because it is an ill-posed problem \n\nregarding the numerical stability in the gravity modelling. According to Grombein et al. \n\n(2011), the harmonic downward continuation can be done by smoothing the observed \n\nGGT GOCE data using the topographic and the isostatic reductions, in a remove- \n\nrestore technique. \n\nAlso, is should be very important to adjust the multi-component gravity gradiometer \n\nalong-track data provided by the GOCE mission to adequately recover the three-\n\ndimensional (3-D) density distribution in large geological structures. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n115 \n\nCHAPTER VIII  \n\nVIII. CONCLUSION \n\nThis work has shown that the gravity field elements obtained from the GOCE mission can improve \n\nthe knowledge about the deep Earth\u2019s structures, such as the crust/mantle boundary and the \n\nneighborhood. The improvement to the field was obtained through the low orbit altitude and the \n\ngradiometric observations on board the satellite. It is particularly apt for recovering density \n\nvariations in the earth's crust and mantle. As an example of the potential of this methodology in the \n\ncharacterization of large geological provinces, we have obtained results that recover an old \n\n'surpassed' idea that stated that the northern and southern portion of the Amazonian craton, \n\nseparated by the Solim\u00f5es and Amazonas basins, would be two different blocks, and that these \n\nbasins had originated at the borders of these two portions.  \n\nIn the past, this discussion had not evolved because the evidences shown by the traditional \n\nAmazonian Craton geology has been entirely built from a few geophysical (some gravity, scarce \n\nmagnetic and seismic), petrological and geochronological data, collected exclusively with the \n\npurpose of helping the mining and the exploration of hydrocarbons in the Amazon basin and the \n\nCarajas Mineral Province (considered the largest mineral province in the world). So, even the sparse \n\navailable data distribution is restricted and limited to the sedimentary basin and some mining field, \n\nand does not permit the characterization of this large and geologically complex region. \n\nVariations in the crustal thickness usually obey the isostatic response due to crustal stretching and \n\nthe mass deficit due to the basin filling with lighter sediments, that accompanies downward \n\ndeflection of the basin-basement associated with the subsidence. Instead of crustal thinning, high \n\ndensity masses in the crust and mantle appear to be a typical feature present in the large \n\nsedimentary basins, caused either by the presence of an intermediate density intruded material or by \n\na partial replacement of the lower crust by the mantle material, continental underplating, or passive \n\nupwelling of molten magma during rifting and extension of the lithosphere (Nunn and Aires, 1988; \n\nBraitenberg &amp; Ebbing 2007). \n\nRecent new paleomagnetic evidences for the Amazon craton is challenging the scientific geological \n\nand geophysical community. Although the rocks of the northern  portion of the craton (Guiana \n\nShield) and the rocks of the southern portion (Brazilian Shield) have ages of settlement that are \n\nclose together, which corroborates the idea of a single cratonic block, the paleomagnetic poles \n\nobtained from rocks of these regions point out that in a certain geological period a transcurrent \n\n\n\n \n\n \n116 \n\nmotion between these blocks must have occurred (Ricardo Trindade, 2012, personal \n\ncommunication). This could be the result of the relative movements of the Guiana Shield, situated \n\nat the north of the Amazon basin, and the Brazilian Shield, situated at the south. Although this is \n\nonly a preliminary additional evidence that points to the controversial hypothesis of the existence of \n\nthese blocks, one should notice that, as pointed out by Lobato (2011), all the types of geophysical \n\ndata that were available in the past in these regions were so bad in quality and in distribution that \n\neven broad structures could not be detected at that time. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n117 \n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY \n\nAkima, H., 1972.

FRAMES AND TIME SYSTEM IN GOCE \n\nSATELLITE \n\nThis appendix is a exact transction from GOCE Level 2 Data Handbook (see, Gruber et al., 2009, \n\ncharpter 4.4.1) \n\nA.1. GRF - Gradiometer Reference Frame &amp; ARF \u2013 Accelerometer Reference \n\nFrame \n\nGRF is the coordinate system in which the components of the gravity gradient tensor are measured \n\nby GOCE (see Figure A.1). The GRF represents the Three-Axis Gradiometer common reference for \n\nthe mutual positioning and alignment of the three One Axis Gradiometers and for the positioning \n\nand orientation of the whole instrument with respect to external reference frames. Nominally the \n\norigins of all one-axis gradiometer reference frames (OAGRF) coincide in one intersection point. \n\nThe corresponding axes of each of the 3 OAGRF\u2019s are parallel and point in the same directions. The \n\ncorresponding 6 accelerometer reference frames (ARF) are parallel and point in the same direction. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n127 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure A.1: Notation and location of the 6 accelerometers of the GOCE gradiometer in the GRF and \n\nwith all 6 ARF\u2019s. The axes of the ARF shown by solid arrows are aligned with ultra sensitive axes \n\nof the accelerometer. The axes of the ARF shown by dashed arrows are aligned to the less sensitive \n\naxes of the accelerometer. Each colour represents a one-axis gradiometer. The shadowed surfaces \n\nrepresent the locations of the lower plates (and the sole plates). \n\nA.1.1. LORF \u2013 Local Orbital Reference Frame \n\nThe origin OLORF is located at the actual satellite centre of mass; XLORF axis (roll) is parallel to \n\ninstantaneous direction of the orbital velocity vector (V) with the same sign as this vector. \n\nYLORF axis (pitch) is parallel to instantaneous direction of the orbital angular momentum (N), with \n\nthe same sign as N (V and N are orthogonal by definition, since N = R \u00d7 V, where R is the vector \n\nfrom the Earth centre to the origin). The ZLORF (yaw) axis is parallel to V \u00d7 N, with the same sign \n\nas V \u00d7 N \n\nA.1.1.1. Orientation of GRF/LORF in Space \n\n\n\n \n\n \n128 \n\nFigure A.2Figure  shows how the fundamental reference frames are related to each other. The GRF \n\ndoes not fully coincide with the LORF. In science mode the satellite will operate in drag-free mode \n\nfor the flight direction only with platform attitude controlled by the magnetorquers over the poles. \n\nSince the magnetorquers can only operate close to the pole, the yaw steering mode allows the roll \n\nangle to accumulate at the equator by a few degrees. The maximum yaw angle value of 3.5\u00b0 is \n\nreached at the equator due to out-of-plane forces caused by Earth rotation. Thus the satellite will be \n\nyaw steered to within \u00b13.5\u00b0 (with respect to the LORF) in order to minimise lateral forces and \n\ntorques. \n\n \n\nFigure A.2: Definition of fundamental Reference Systems for GOCE. \n\nA.2. Earth-Fixed Reference Frame (EFRF) \n\nThe Earth-Fixed Reference System (EFRF) is a spatial reference system co-rotating with the Earth \n\nin its diurnal motion in space. The EFRF is an orthogonal, right-handed system. Its origin is at the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n129 \n\nEarth\u2019s center of mass (geocenter), the orientation is equatorial (z-axis is the direction of the pole). \n\nThe x-axis is fixed in the equatorial plane in direction to the Greenwich meridian. The angle \n\nbetween the x-axis of the inertial reference frame (defined by the vernal equinox) and the \n\nGreenwich meridian is the Greenwich Apparent Sideral Time (GAST). \n\nA.3. Local North Oriented Frame (LNOF) \n\nThe Local North Oriented Frame (LNOF) is a right-handed North-West-Up frame with the X-axis \n\npointing North, the Y-axis pointing West and the Z-axis Up. The calibrated gravity gradients of the \n\nEGG_TRF_2 products are provided in this system. \n\n? The origin OLNOF is located at the nominal satellite centre of mass \n\n? ZLNOF is defined as the vector from the geocenter to the origin OLNOF, pointing radially \noutward, \n\n? YLNOF is parallel to the normal vector to the plane of the geocentric meridian of the satellite \ncenter of mass, pointing westward, \n\n? XLNOF is parallel to the normal vector to the plane defined by YLNOF and ZLNOF. \n\nIn geocentric latitude and East longitude (?, ?) of the GOCE center of mass in the CTRS \n\n(Conventional Terrestrial Reference System) the 3 axes are defined as follows: \n\n       \n        \n        \n\n    \n ;        \n\n    \n     \n\n \n  ;        \n\n         \n         \n\n    \n  \n\nA.4. Time System  \n\nAll GOCE products are time-tagged in GPS-time. This time will be derived by correlating the on-\n\nboard time with the GPS time. In case no GPS time is available (due to receiver outage) the GPS \n\ntime is automatically determined by correlating the on-board time with UTC and applying the \n\nconstant and leap second time shift. \n\nReference \n\nGruber, Th., Rummel, R., Abrikosov, O., van Hees., R. 2009.

Terrestrial data recover \n\ngravity signals at shorter wavelengths compared to the GOCE satellite, but the average gravity \n\nanomaly values can be compared to the GOCE derived values which are bandlimited to lower \n\nfrequencies.   \n\nWe consider the area of the Amazon Craton, and in particular the Solim\u00f5es, Amazon and Parnaiba \n\nBasins, and part of the Tocantins and S\u00e3o Francisco Provinces in Brazil, to estimate the systematic \n\nerrors in terrestrial gravity data. We calculate the average terrestrial gravity anomaly by spatial \n\naverages applying Gaussian, inverse square distance and simple averages, which allows to compare \n\nthe long- and medium- wavelength part of the terrestrial gravity anomalies with the gravity field \n\nderived from GOCE. We also consider the combined satellite-terrestrial model EGM2008  up to \n\ndegree and order 250 (i.e., maximum expansion from satellite GOCE). The results show that the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n131 \n\nsystematic errors range from about -69.6 to 44.1 mGal with a RMS value of 11.6 mGal. The mean \n\nvalue over the study area is about zero, obtaining -0.9 mGal difference between the Gaussian \n\naverage of the terrestrial gravity data and the gravity data from the GOCE satellite-only model and  \n\nis smaller than the commission error associated to the geopotential model. Also, we verified that \n\n38.2 per cent of the study area does not present systematic errors, as their difference is within the \n\ncommission error of 5.06 mGal of the GOCE model in the harmonic expansion up to degree 250.   \n\nThe comparison of the terrestrial data with the model EGM2008 gives slightly smaller differences, \n\nwhich can be attributed to the fact that the EGM2008 contains terrestrial data. The results vary only \n\nslightly according to the type of averaging used, with improved values for the Gaussian average. \n\nThe analysis also shows where the terrestrial data are scarce and require an improvement in data \n\ncoverage in order to correctly represent the gravity field. The method we propose can be directly \n\nused to control other gravity data bases and constitutes a tool for the quality assessment of terrestrial \n\ngravity observations. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nGlobal Geopotential Models (GGMs) make use of spatially averaged terrestrial data in order to \n\ninclude short-wavelength spherical harmonic coefficients and to improve estimates of the Earth\u2019s \n\ngravity field (Jekeli 1981, Wahr et al., 1998, Tapley et al. 2004, Chen et al., 2006). In this work we \n\nwill use the Gaussian averaging function (Jekeli, 1981), the inverse square distance weighted \n\naverage and a simple average to analyze the available terrestrial gravity data in the Amazon Basin \n\narea, Brazil, in order to compare them with the satellite-only and mixed satellite-terrestrial \n\ngeopotential models. The terrestrial data allow to have detailed and accurate information about the \n\nshort wavelengths of the gravity field, and we can estimate a mean gravity anomaly corresponding \n\nto the long wavelengths, comparable to the resolution of satellite observations. \n\nThe spherical harmonic gravity models obtained from geodetic satellite missions describe the low-\n\ndegree components of the Earth\u2019s gravity field homogenously and accurately. The terrestrial gravity \n\n\n\n \n\n \n132 \n\nanomalies are accurate at short-wavelengths, but are highly susceptible to the systematic errors at \n\nmedium- and long wavelengths, as pointed out by Heck (1990). Therefore, as described in Amos \n\nand Featherstone (2003), the terrestrial gravity anomalies don't form a flawless set of data to test \n\nGGMs, especially the satellite-only GGMs derived from the satellite gravity field missions. For the \n\nsame reasons combined GGMs (e.g. EGM2008, Pavlis et al., 2012) can carry with them spurious \n\nerrors from the terrestrial gravity data. \n\nThe main goal of this paper is to use the gravity field derived from the GOCE satellite-only model \n\n(Pail et al., 2011) to make a regional quality assessment of the terrestrial gravity data. Since the \n\nterrestrial gravity data are often used to validate the satellite data, the existence of systematic errors \n\nin the terrestrial gravity data may cause serious problems in the development of the GGMs. \n\nFurthermore we analyze the differences between EGM2008 and GOCE, and EGM2008 and the \n\nterrestrial data to compare the performance of this field in the study area. In order to study this \n\nsubject, we start from the accuracy estimates of the commission error associated to the GGMs in the \n\nform of expected degree error of the gravity anomaly (free-air anomaly) for GOCE (Pail et al., \n\n2011) and EGM2008 (Pavlis et al., 2008). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n133 \n\nFigure 1: Terrestrial gravity anomalies available in Brazil  (Courtesy IAG/USP). \n\nThe terrestrial gravity anomalies are relatively precise, nevertheless they are often contaminated by \n\nsystematic errors such as geodetic datum errors, positioning errors (mainly elevation), reduction \n\nerrors, geodynamic effects and instrumental errors (e.g. gravimeter drift), which tends to \n\naccumulate over long distances (Amos and Featherstone, 2003). These and other systematic errors \n\nwere studied by Heck (1990).  Roland and Denker (2003) showed that the largest error components \n\ncome from inconsistencies in the gravity observations and the horizontal and vertical positioning \n\nreference systems. It is almost impossible to estimate and correct these errors due to the lack of \n\nquantitative information about them (Huang et al., 2008). \n\nHuang et al. (2008) described a method to assess the systematic errors of the low spherical \n\nharmonic degrees due to errors in the surface gravity anomalies. For this they used three types of \n\ntechniques on averaging process surface data, such as low-pass filtering, the inverse Stokes integral, \n\nand spherical harmonic analysis. Only a few authors estimated the systematic errors in the global \n\nterrestrial gravity data (Mainville &amp; Rapp, 1985; Pavlis, 2000; Amos &amp; Featherstone, 2003), and \n\nV\u00e9ronneau &amp; Huang (2003) also used the averaging filter and the inverse Stokes integral techniques \n\nto estimate systematic errors in the GGMs.  \n\nAs the Brazilian territory has continental dimensions, the gravity data were collected by many \n\ninstitutions and with different aims. Figure 1 maps the distribution of the terrestrial data in Brazil, \n\nwhich is estimated to  have a mean spatial resolution of 5 arc-minute in most of the area (S\u00e1, 2004). \n\nPartially these data have been integrated in the global 5' x 5' gravity database used to build \n\nEGM2008 (Pavlis et al., 2008). \n\nThe final combination solution of the EGM2008 was developed and evaluated by a least squares \n\ncombination of the ITG-GRACE03S gravitational model and its associated error covariance matrix \n\nand the gravitational information obtained from a global set of area-mean free-air gravity anomalies \n\ndefined on a 5 arc-minute equiangular grid. As described in Pavlis et al. (2012), they formed the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n134 \n\nfinal grid by merging terrestrial, altimetry-derived, and airborne gravity data. Over areas where only \n\nlower resolution gravity data were available, the higher degree spectral content was supplemented \n\nwith gravitational information implied by the topography. \n\nThe EGM2008 is complete to degree and order 2159 with additional coefficients extending up to \n\ndegree 2190. In order to compare this model with the GOCE satellite-only model (Pail et al., 2011) \n\nwe compute the EGM2008 values up to degree and order 250, the maximum available degree of the \n\nGOCE model. \n\nSTUDY AREA AND A GENERAL OUTLINE OF THE GEOLOGY \n\nThe study area embraces the region of the Amazon, Solim\u00f5es and Parna\u00edba sedimentary basins and \n\na small part of Tocantins, S\u00e3o Francisco and Borborema Provinces in Brazil (Figure 2). \n\n \n\nFigure 2: Availability of terrestrial gravity data (red) used to estimate the gravity field on a regular grid \n\nwith approximately 80 km spacing (blue dots). These averaged values will be used in the comparison \n\nwith the GGMs.  \n\nGeologically, the area comprises the Solim\u00f5es, Amazon and Parna\u00edba paleozoic basins. Amazon \n\nand Solim\u00f5es basins are classified as intracratonic paleozoic basins. Together they cover almost \n\n\n\n \n\n \n135 \n\n1,000,000 km\n2\n. The basins belong to an intracontinental rift system that straddles the border \n\nbetween the Brazil and Guyana Shields, covering some 4,500 km\n2\n of the Brazilian territory. The \n\nParna\u00edba Province is also a paleozoic that covers some 600,000 km\n2\n, filled with Ordovician to Early \n\nTriassic sediments, mostly of marine environment, but also with fluvio-deltaic and desertic \n\ncontributions (Bizzi et al., 2004).  \n\nThe terrestrial Bouguer anomaly map shows a chain of gravity highs that transect the Amazon \n\nBasin and are roughly coincident with the maximum thickness of the sedimentary rocks (Figure 3). \n\nThe structure of the Amazon Basin is presently not perfectly known, and several hypotheses exist to \n\nexplain the positive and negative axial signals (Nunn and Aires, 1988; Eiras et al., 1984). It is \n\nessential to have a reliable gravity field and have perfect knowledge on the precision of the \n\nterrestrial field. \n\n \n\nFigure 3: Bouguer anomaly map obtained from terrestrial data. The blue line delineates a chain of gravity \n\nhighs that is discussed in the text. \n\nMETHODS FOR ERROR ESTIMATION \n\nOur analysis requires the evaluation of the errors in the terrestrial data and the errors on the GOCE \n\nand EGM2008 spherical harmonic models. We also analyze the error of the difference between the \n\nterrestrial observations and the gravity derived from the GGMs. We proceed in three steps. The first \n\ndescribes the definition of the degree errors for the GGMs, the second the systematic errors in the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n136 \n\nlow spherical harmonic degrees of the terrestrial data, and the third the procedure to correctly \n\naverage the terrestrial data with an adequate spatial filter that corresponds to the maximum \n\nharmonic degree of the expansion of the GGM.  \n\nI. Errors GOCE: From Degree Amplitude to Gravity Anomaly errors  \n\nWahr et al. (1998) defined the error of the geoid in terms of the GGM estimate as: \n\n                    \n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\n   \n\n                          \n(1) \n\n \n\nwhere ?Clm and ?Slm are the errors of the geopotential models coefficients. Then the spatial variance \n\nof the geoid error, taken over the entire globe, is \n\n    \n  \n\n \n\n  \n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n       \n \n\n \n\n                  \n      \n\n  \n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\n   \n\n (2) \n\nThe degree amplitude or degree variances from the geopotential model error is defined as \n\n            \n      \n\n  \n\n \n\n   \n\n (3) \n\nThe error estimate of the gravity anomaly is obtained similarly. Therefore the RMS (Root Mean \n\nSquare) anomaly errors at degree l are computed by: \n\n      \n  \n\n  \n            \n\n      \n  \n\n \n\n   \n\n (4) \n\n   \n and    \n\n  are the geoid and gravity anomaly degree variances that can be estimated by using the \n\nstandard error of the disturbing potential coefficients ?Clm, ?Slm. GM is the gravitational constant \n\nmultiplied by the Earth mass and a the equatorial radius. The degree l is a measure of the spatial \n\nscale of the spherical harmonic,  as the spatial resolution expressed as half-wavelength is given by \n\n\n\n \n\n \n137 \n\n20,000 km/l.  So    \n  and    \n\n  are a measure of the contribution to the variances at degree l, their \n\nsum up to maximum degree L the variance for all  terms up to a given spatial scale. \n\nThe cumulative error in gravity anomaly is shown in Fig. 4 for spherical harmonic coefficients up to \n\ndegree and order 250 and is about 1.61 mGal for EGM2008 and 5.06 mGal for GOCE. The GOCE \n\nmodel we use is the third TIM release GO_CONS_GCF_2_TIM_R3 of Pail et al. (2011). \n\n \n\nFigure 4: RMS errors in the gravity anomaly from the geopotential models GOCE and EGM08 in the \n\ngravity anomaly (free-air), signal, error and difference between EGM08 and GOCE.  \n\nII. Systematic errors of low spherical harmonic degree in surface gravity anomalies \n\nThe systematic errors of low spherical harmonic degree in the terrestrial gravity anomalies were \n\nstudied by Huang et al. (2008), expressing the Earth gravity field in terms of GGM can be modeled \n\nby spherical harmonic expansion as follows \n\n            \n   \n\n \n\n   \n\n (5) \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n138 \n\nwhere ?g\nGGM \n\nis the gravity anomaly; L is the maximum degree of the global geopotential model \n\n(GGM); gl is the spherical harmonic component of degree l and   \n    is the commission error \n\nassociated with the GGM. \n\nSimilarly, the terrestrial gravity anomaly ?g\nTG \n\ndescribed in spherical harmonics can be expressed by \n\n?          \n     \n\n     \n\n \n\n   \n\n  (6) \n\nThe second and third terms of the summation are the low and high-degree systematic errors, \n\nrespectively.

In order to remove the high degree field components, and high degree \n\nsystematic and random errors, Huang et al. (2008) smoothed ?g\nTG\n\n. Here, we smooth the \n\nobservation through spatial averaging as shown in the section below. \n\nIII. Spatial Averaging \n\n\n\n \n\n \n139 \n\nBefore comparing the terrestrial observations with the field derived from GOCE and EGM08, the \n\nobservations have to be smoothed so the averaged field corresponds only to the long-wavelength \n\npart of the field and spatial resolution is adequate for the GOCE geopotential model.  \n\nHere, we will use three averaging functions, the simple average, the inverse square distance, and the \n\nGaussian averaging function (Jekeli, 1981). The terrestrial data have more detailed and accurate \n\ninformation at short-wavelengths, with respect to the satellite observations, and these will be used to \n\nobtain a mean gravity anomaly corresponding to the long-wavelengths. The idea is to get the \n\naveraged gravity anomaly from the terrestrial data at the corresponding grid point of the gravity \n\nanomalies calculated from the geopotential global models (for example: EGM2008 and GOCE up \n\nto degree and order 250) so that we can make comparisons between the gravity anomalies at long \n\nwavelengths obtained from the global geopotential models and the terrestrial data, and estimate the \n\nerrors of the terrestrial data. \n\nThe simple average of the gravity anomalies is defined as follows: \n\n \n\n      \n    \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n(10) \n\nwhere gzi, i=1...n are the n gravity anomaly observations. \n\nWe define the inverse quadratic distance as the weighting function for the weighted average, since \n\nthe gravitational field decreases as the inverse square of the distance \n\n      \n\n    \n \n\n  \n  \n\n \n   \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n \n   \n\n \n(11) \n\nwhere r is distance between the observation point and the averaged point at the regular grid (Figure \n\n7). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n140 \n\nThe Gaussian average is also a weighted average, where the weight is the Gaussian averaging \n\nfunction W(?) for the radius at r. \n\n      \n          \n\n \n   \n\n      \n \n   \n\n \n(12) \n\nwhere the Gaussian averaging function or operator W(?) is supposed to depend only on the kernel ? \n\n(i.e. the spherical distance between the computation point and integration point), where the region \n\nof integration is a spherical cap centered at the computation point (Jekeli, 1981). The function is \n\nnormalized so that the global integral of W is equal 1 (Wahr et al.,1998): \n\n     \n \n\n  \n\n           \n\n      \n \n\n(13) \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n   \n\n            \n \n\n(14) \n\n \n\nwhere r is the averaging radius (i.e., the distance on the Earth\u2019s surface at which W has dropped to \n\nhalf of its value at origin (? =0), where the distance on the Earth\u2019s surface = a?, 0 ? ? ? ?) and a is \n\nthe Earth's mean radius (~6371 km).  \n\nIn terms of the spherical harmonic development, Jekeli (1981) showed that the coefficients Wl of \n\nthe Gaussian weighting function can be obtained following the recursion formula (Equation 15).  \n\n   \n \n\n  \n  \n\n   \n \n\n  \n \n      \n\n      \n \n\n \n\n \n  \n\n (15) \n\n      \n    \n\n \n        \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n141 \n\n \n\nFigure 5: (a) Spatial averaging: Gaussian averaging function W(?)

The \n\nhistogram of the altitude differences was used to analyze the mean and the standard deviation of \n\nthese differences, and then discard the gravity measurements with errors greater than the 99 percent \n\nconfidence interval. We consider acceptable only those gravity points in which the altitude \n\ndifference with SRTM lies within 3 standard deviations of the mean. The eliminated data could also \n\nbe related to the interpolation errors. However, it was verified that the altitude differences higher \n\n\n\n \n\n \n142 \n\nthan three standard deviation coincide or are very close, to the SRTM grid points of 3 arc second \n\n(approximately 90 m) resolution (Jarvis et al., 2008) and therefore cannot be explained by \n\ninterpolation errors.  \n\nAmong the originally 8320 terrestrial altitude data compared with the SRTM altitudes, we have \n\nfound only 33 points that could not be compared with SRTM data, as they had NaN (Not a Number) \n\nvalues in SRTM. These points were then interpolated with ETOPO1 altitude data (Amante and \n\nEakins, 2008) which has a resolution of 1 arc minute (spatial resolution ~ 1850 m). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n143 \n\n \n\nFigure 6: Comparison of data from terrestrial altitudes and interpolated SRTM altitudes at the same points: \n\n(a) subdivision of the study area in tiles of 1\u00ba x 1\u00ba to overcome overload of the computer's memory in \n\ninterpolating; and (b) histogram and statistic of the differences between the interpolated SRTM altitudes \n\nwith the terrestrial altitude data. \n\nTo facilitate the calculations and not to overload the computer's memory, the study area was \n\nsubdivided into tiles of 1\u00ba x 1\u00ba, resulting in 700 tiles in the region. Only 287 blocks had gravity data \n\nand were interpolated to obtain the SRTM altitude data at the same points of the terrestrial height \n\ndata (Figure 6a).  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n144 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7: Schematic figure showing how the averages were estimated from terrestrial data within a radius of \n\n80 km (black circle) to obtain the long-wavelength field. 8232 terrestrial data measurements are distributed \n\nsparsely (red dots) and 466 data from the geopotential models (blue cross) are distributed on a regularly \n\nspaced grid of 80 x 80 km grid spacing. The radius is centered in each of the 466 regular grid points.  \n\nThe differences between the interpolated SRTM heights and the terrestrial altitude data in the \n\nhistogram (Figure 6b) showed a standard Gaussian distribution with a mean value of 5.3 m and a \n\nstandard deviation of 33.2 m. Some anomalous points in the height differences were found greater \n\nthan 90 meters, and we assumed that these points probably have wrong altitudes in terrestrial data. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n145 \n\nOnly 88 of 8320 values showed height differences higher than 3 standard deviations of the mean. \n\nFigure 6a depict 88 points (bold-faced blue dots) that have been considered erroneous (gross errors) \n\nand so should be discarded. All the other 8232 remainder points (lightweight blue dots) were \n\nconsidered acceptable within the confidence interval (3 standard deviations). Finally, a total of 8232 \n\nreliable terrestrial data were used for our main study to obtain a regional assessment of the \n\nterrestrial gravity observation errors. \n\nWe proceed now in applying the averaging process to the terrestrial data presented in Figure 2. We \n\ncalculate the gravity anomalies for the two global geopotential models EGM2008 and GOCE (Pail \n\net al., 2011) up to degree and order 250, which is equivalent to a maximum spatial resolution of 80 \n\nkm half-wavelength.  The comparison between the obtained values (Figure 7) allows us to estimate \n\nthe errors of the terrestrial gravity data when compared to the gravity anomalies obtained from the \n\ngeopotential models. The interest is to investigate whether this approach allows us to make a \n\nregional quality assessment and detect the systematic errors of the terrestrial observations (Figure 8 \n\nthrough 13). \n\nThe scattered values of the terrestrial gravity anomaly data points were averaged within a radius of \n\n80 km from regularly spaced grid points using simple, inverse square distance and Gaussian \n\naverages given by equations Eq. (10), Eq. (11) and Eq. (12), respectively. \n\nWe estimated the gravity anomaly differences between the averaged terrestrial data and the GOCE \n\nmodel or the averaged terrestrial data and the EGM2008 model, and also between the GOCE and \n\nEGM2008 models, in order to determine the low-degree systematic errors in the terrestrial gravity \n\nmeasurements from eq. (9).  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n146 \n\n \n\nFigure 8: Differences between gravity anomaly estimated from the weighted inverse square distance average \n\nof terrestrial data and the gravity anomaly calculated from the a) EGM2008 and b) GOCE geopotential \n\nmodel up to degree and order 250.

The spatial resolution is 80 km; (b) histogram of the gravity anomalies \n\ndifferences between EGM2008 and GOCE. \n\nFigure 10 shows the comparison between the GGMs, i.e. the difference between the gravity \n\nanomalies from GOCE and EGM2008 models, which are due to commission errors of the finite \n\nspherical harmonic expansions. The EGM2008 can be affected by errors in the terrestrial data, \n\nbecause only up to degree 70 does it contain purely satellite observations.  We expect a smaller \n\ndifference between the GGMs due to the low commission errors of the models (Figure 4) when \n\ncompared to the differences between the averaged terrestrial and GGMs measurements (Figure 11).  \n\nAs showed in Braitenberg et al. (2011) and Alvarez et al. (2012), this analysis permits controlling \n\nand testing the quality of terrestrial data, for example, airborne campaigns. The EGM08 global \n\ngravity field in some regions shows problems that can be traced back to missing data or poor quality \n\nof the terrestrial gravity data used as input. As the GOCE data are independent of terrestrial data, \n\n\n\n \n\n \n149 \n\nthey can produce a new quality assessment tool for GGMs of higher resolution, and are also \n\nadequate to assess the quality of terrestrial observations even if the spatial resolution of the \n\nterrestrial data is higher than that of the GOCE model.  Geological structures can be studied with \n\nEGM08 data, as far as the terrestrial data points used to calculate the model are available at the \n\nrequired resolution and of sufficient precision. In this aspect the GOCE data, as an independent \n\nsource with high quality information, can be a valuable tool to work with, provided that the error \n\nanalysis is successfully conducted. \n\nThe differences between the averaged terrestrial data points and the values calculated from the \n\nGGMs at the same point are shown in Figure 11. The mean values of the differences are near zero, \n\nwith little variations according to the filtering scheme used in the terrestrial mean data calculation. \n\nThese small values are within the commission error of about 1.61 mGal and 5.06 mGal for gravity \n\nanomalies from EGM2008 and GOCE geopotential models up to degree 250, respectively. For this, \n\nwe assume that the points which have deviations in the same order of the commission errors are \n\nconsidered as errorless, and that points that lie within 2 standard deviations of the mean can be \n\nconsidered acceptable.  \n\nThe histograms allow us to identify also the areas (Figure 12) with the greatest systematic errors \n\n(here considered greater than two standard deviations from the mean). Comparison to the gravity \n\nmaps obtained from terrestrial data and EGM08 and GOCE show that the errors are in the order of \n\nthe gravity values (Figure 13). \n\nIn Figure 12 the results are mapped. Green tiles are considered the most reliable areas, free of \n\nsystematic errors, as they are within the commission error of the respective geopotential model. The \n\nblue tiles have systematic errors considered acceptable, and are within two standard deviations of \n\nthe mean, and the red tiles have large systematic errors, greater than two standard deviations,  \n\ndefining the areas where the terrestrial data cannot be used for further study. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n150 \n\n \n\nFigure 11: Systematic errors of gravity anomaly elements obtained for (averaged terrestrial data - \n\nEGM2008) (upper) and (averaged terrestrial data - GOCE) (lower): the averaged terrestrial data refers to \n\nsimple, weighted and Gaussian gravity anomaly mean,  respectively in the left, center and right column. \n\nWe have also verified that the highest amount of systematic error-free area was 38.2 percent using \n\nthe Gaussian average with the GOCE model, although with the differences respect to EGM2008 \n\nslightly higher percentages were obtained for the areas without systematic errors. Probably, this is \n\ndue to the fact that EGM08 includes some of the same terrestrial gravity data, which carried \n\neventual systematic errors. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n151 \n\n \n\nFigure 12: The low-degree systematic errors of the terrestrial gravity data indicates the locations where the \n\nterrestrial measurements should not be used for geological studies.  \n\nIf we compare the distribution of the observed scattered gravity data with the systematic error map, \n\nwe find that the areas with smaller systematic errors correlate with areas of higher data density. The \n\nerror estimates (Figure 11 and Figure 12) are robust with respect to the type of spatial average filter \n\nused, as the results do not differ significantly.  \n\nFigure 13 shows the free-air anomaly for the models EGM2008, GOCE and terrestrial data. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n152 \n\n \n\nFigure 13: Free-air gravity anomaly from terrestrial, combined gravity model (EGM2008 \u2013 Pavlis et al., \n\n2008) and satellite-only gepotential model (GOCE \u2013 Pail et al., 2011) data, respectively.  \n\nDescription of the gravity fields in relation to geology \n\nThe free-air gravity anomaly maps show approximately a chain of gravity highs of +15 mGal to \n\n+35 mGal that transect the Amazon Basin, roughly coincident with the maximum thickness of \n\nsedimentary rocks (Nunn and Aires, 1988). This gravity high is flanked by gravity lows to the north \n\nand south. Nunn and Aires (1988) interpreted the flanking gravity anomaly lows as being primarily \n\ndue to the presumed downward deflection of the crust/mantle boundary beneath the basin. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n153 \n\nThe relatively high values of the gravity anomaly in correspondence to the basin axis point to a \n\npossible densification of the crust or upper mantle, or to the presence of intrusive rocks, because the \n\nsediments contribute to lower the gravity anomaly signal, as well as the Moho, which has a depth of \n\nabout 42 km or more (Lloyd et al., 2010). In particular, the presence of possible diabase sills lying \n\nwithin or beneath the Amazon Basin has been postulated by some authors, and originated during \n\nlate Triassic to early Jurassic, in an event known as the Penatecaua magmatism (Eiras et al.,1994). \n\nThese igneous rocks may have migrated in a natural way following the sedimentary beds down dip \n\ncausing the presence of a high density material that transects the Amazon Basin roughly coincident \n\nwith the maximum thickness of the sedimentary rocks present in the basin. \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n\nThe differences between the regional terrestrial gravity anomalies smoothed in order to remove the \n\nhigh degree components and the satellite-only gravity anomalies recovered from satellite GOCE \n\nshowed that the terrestrial gravity anomalies in the study area are affected by low-degree (up to \n\nL=250) systematic errors. The statistical analysis in terms of histograms of the gravity differences \n\nreveal systematic errors in the terrestrial data, showing that the region in the study area presents \n\nabout 4.3% of data points with large systematic errors (considering large errors as values greater \n\nthan two standard deviations from a mean which is close to zero) and 38.2% data points with are \n\nhigh quality (i.e. without systematic errors). The most appropriate averaging of the terrestrial data is \n\naccomplished with the Gaussian smoothing procedure. The systematic errors have a mean value \n\nclose to zero, which is smaller than the commission errors associated to the EGM2008 and GOCE \n\nmodels. \n\nThe terrestrial data are also compared to the EGM2008 global model that was built with both \n\nsatellite and terrestrial data. The resulting systematic errors on terrestrial data are slightly lower than \n\nthose found with the GOCE model, probably by the simple fact that the EGM2008 model contains \n\nthe gravitational information derived from a global terrestrial data set (Pavlis et al., 2012); as it is \n\n\n\n \n\n \n154 \n\nknown that the terrestrial gravity data are often contaminated by systematic errors, such errors could \n\nbe included in the geopotential model. \n\nThe satellite-only derived geopotential model of GOCE does not present such systematic errors. \n\nThe present analysis shows that the GOCE model is reliable to define the areas where the terrestrial \n\ndata show greater systematic errors and should be used only with care or not be used at all for \n\naccurate geophysical modelling. \n\nOne final point is that we can see the effect of varying amount and irregular distribution of the \n\navailable terrestrial data in the study region, which is common to most inaccessible areas of our \n\nplanet. Thus, we can identify the existence of terrestrial data gaps that correlate with the large \n\nsystematic errors.  \n\nThe scheme we propose has been illustrated for the Amazon Basin, but is easily applied to any other \n\narea. An important application could be the systematic control of terrestrial databases by national \n\nagencies. We predict that cross-national datum shift which affect the gravity value could be \n\ndetected in databases that include gravity anomalies from different nations. \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\nWe thank PETROBRAS, ANP and IAG-USP (Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and \n\nAtmospheric Sciences \u2013 University of S\u00e3o Paulo) for the use of the terrestrial data, the Italian Space \n\nAgency (ASI) for supporting the GOCE-Italy project, the Ministero dell\u2019Istruzione, dell\u2019Universita\u2019 \n\ne della Ricerca (MIUR) under project PRIN, 2008CR4455_003 for financial support, and ESA for \n\ngranting of AO_GOCE_proposal_4323_Braitenberg, the University of Trieste and the University of \n\nS\u00e3o Paulo for supporting part of this research, as well, scholarships from CAPES and CNPq, in \n\nBrazil, for financial support.
