Durante a fase mais acelerada da transgress\u00e3o marinha p\u00f3s-glaciar que caracterizou o \n\nfinal do Pleistoc\u00e9nico e o in\u00edcio do Holoc\u00e9nico, ambos os ambientes revelaram sequ\u00eancias \n\ncom tend\u00eancia transgressiva. A subida do n\u00edvel do mar constituiu o principal fator \n\ncondicionante do tipo e quantidade de sedimentos fornecidos \u00e0 plataforma, bem como das \n\nesp\u00e9cies de foramin\u00edferos colonizadoras desses sedimentos. Com o n\u00edvel do mar a aproximar-\n\nse do atual por volta do Holoc\u00e9nico m\u00e9dio, os fatores clim\u00e1ticos revelaram-se preponderantes \n\nna evolu\u00e7\u00e3o dos padr\u00f5es depocicionais e ecol\u00f3gicos. Foram registadas profundas altera\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ndurante os \u00faltimos cerca de 2,500-1,500 anos, com maiores quantidades de finos a serem \n\nfornecidos \u00e0 plataforma e uma mudan\u00e7a clara nas faunas de foramin\u00edferos do corpo lodoso. \n\nAs ocupa\u00e7\u00f5es Romana e Isl\u00e2mica do sul da Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica ter\u00e3o tido grande import\u00e2ncia no \n\ndesenvolvimento destas altera\u00e7\u00f5es, provocando profundos impactes na paisagem e nas taxas \n\nde eros\u00e3o ao longo da Bacia do Guadiana. Desde ent\u00e3o, e at\u00e9 pr\u00f3ximo da atualidade, o registo \n\nda plataforma e do corpo lodoso revelaram terem sido os impactos antr\u00f3picos aliados \u00e0s \n\noscila\u00e7\u00f5es mais recentes do clima, em grande parte modeladas pela Oscila\u00e7\u00e3o do Atl\u00e2ntico \n\nNorte (NAO), os principais agentes modeladores de toda a regi\u00e3o em estudo. \n\nPalavras-chave: Plataforma do Guadiana, Plistoc\u00e9nico/Holoc\u00e9nico, varia\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas, \n\nsedimentos, foramin\u00edferos bent\u00f3nicos, reconstru\u00e7\u00e3o paleoambiental \n\n \n\n\n\nvi \n\t\n \u00a0\n\nABSTRACT \n\nThe current work investigates the main depositional events that occurred on the continental \n\nshelf adjacent to the Guadiana River mouth (northern Gulf of Cadis, southwestern Iberian \n\nPeninsula) during the late Pleistocene and the Holocene, and relates them with main forcing \n\nmechanisms, namely climate change, mean sea-level rise and the impact of human activities \n\nin the region. An integrated approach based on several palaeoindicators was conducted in four \n\nsediment cores collected on the shelf, including sedimentological (sediment grain-size, sand \n\nfraction composition and morphoscopy of quartz grains) and micropalaeontological (benthic \n\nforaminifera) data, integrated into a temporal framework obtained from AMS (Accelerated \n\nMass Spectometry) radiocarbon (14C) datings. One of these cores was located on the inner \n\nshelf and the other three on the mid-shelf mud body. Data analysis and integration allowed to \n\nrecognize the specific evolution of the depositional patterns in each one of these shelf \n\ndomains and to interpret the evolution of the mud body. Moreover, the higher resolution of \n\nthe muddy deposits enabled to reconstruct with greater detail the history of the region. \n\nDuring the phase of fast sea-level rise that marked the late Pleistocene and the beginning of \n\nthe Holocene, both shelf domains revealed a transgressive trend, with the rise in sea level \n\nconstituting the main controlling factor of the type and amount of sediments that reached the \n\nshelf, and also of the main benthic foraminiferal species that colonized the middle shelf \n\nenvironment. As the mean sea level approached its present-day position around mid-\n\nHolocene, the climatic mechanisms became preponderant in determining the evolution of the \n\ndepositional and ecological patterns across the shelf until ca. 2,500 years ago. Profound \n\nchanges were observed during the last ca. 2,500-1,500 years, with higher amounts of \n\nsediments, mostly fine-grained, starting to reach the shelf and the onset of a clear \n\nmodification on the benthic foraminifera of the mud body. The Roman and Islamic \n\noccupation of southern Iberia seemed to have been the main cause behind these changes, as \n\nthey led to intensive land-use activities that enhanced soil erosion along the Guadiana Basin. \n\nSince then, and until modern times, the depositional record of the shelf and of the mud body, \n\nin particular, showed that the coupled-action of the anthropogenic impact with the more \n\nrecent climate variations, these largely modulated by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), \n\nhas been the main forcing agent for the environmental changes occurring in the study area.  \n\nKeywords: Guadiana shelf, Pleistocene/Holocene, climate change, sediments, benthic \n\nforaminiferal, paleoenvironmental reconstruction \n\n \n\n\n\nvii \n\t\n \u00a0\n\nRESUMO ALARGADO \n\nO presente trabalho teve como objetivo aprofundar os principais conhecimentos sobre os \n\nprincipais processos e eventos deposicionais ocorridos na plataforma continental adjacente ao \n\nRio Guadiana (localizada no norte do Golfo de C\u00e1dis, Sudoeste da Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica) durante \n\no per\u00edodo decorrente desde o final do Pleistoc\u00e9nico at\u00e9 \u00e0 atualidade, e sua rela\u00e7\u00e3o com os \n\nprincipais mecanismos for\u00e7adores, nomeadamente as varia\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas, a subida do n\u00edvel \n\nm\u00e9dio do mar e os impactes antr\u00f3picos na regi\u00e3o. O Rio Guadiana drena uma vasta regi\u00e3o \n\ncom caracter\u00edsticas semi-\u00e1ridas, sendo o principal fornecedor de sedimentos e nutrientes \u00e0 \n\nplataforma, sobretudo atrav\u00e9s de eventos de cheias. O regime fluvial deste rio, incluindo a \n\ngeneralidade da sua bacia hidrogr\u00e1fica, \u00e9 altamente suscet\u00edvel a altera\u00e7\u00f5es do clima. De igual \n\nforma, o intenso desenvolvimento humano que vem marcando toda a regi\u00e3o da Bacia do \n\nGuadiana desde h\u00e1 mil\u00e9nios e, particularmente, ap\u00f3s a Ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o Romana da Pen\u00ednsula \n\nIb\u00e9rica, julga-se ter contribu\u00eddo decisivamente para importantes altera\u00e7\u00f5es nos padr\u00f5es \n\nerosivos dos solos, com consequ\u00eancias expect\u00e1veis ao n\u00edvel do tipo e volume de sedimentos \n\nexportados pelo rio para o litoral e plataforma continental adjacente. \n\nTendo em vista o objetivo proposto, recorreu-se a uma abordagem integrada de indicadores \n\npresentes em quatro testemunhos verticais de sedimentos recolhidos na plataforma \n\ncontinental, incluindo dados sedimentol\u00f3gicos (textura sedimentar, composi\u00e7\u00e3o da fra\u00e7\u00e3o \n\narenosa e morfoscopia dos gr\u00e3os de quartzo) e micropaleontol\u00f3gicos (foramin\u00edferos \n\nbent\u00f3nicos), integrados numa malha temporal constru\u00edda com base em data\u00e7\u00f5es radiocarbono. \n\nDestes testemunhos, um localizou-se no ambiente da plataforma interna, a cerca de 12 metros \n\nde profundidade e localizado a oeste da desembocadura do Rio Guadiana, e os outros tr\u00eas no \n\ncorpo lodoso da plataforma adjacente \u00e0 foz do Guadiana, na plataforma m\u00e9dia, entre os 40 e \n\nos 90 metros de profundidade. A an\u00e1lise e integra\u00e7\u00e3o de todos os dados permitiu, por um \n\nlado, reconhecer a evolu\u00e7\u00e3o espec\u00edfica dos padr\u00f5es deposicionais em cada um dos ambientes \n\nde plataforma e sua rela\u00e7\u00e3o direta com as modifica\u00e7\u00f5es nas descargas do rio e, por outro, \n\nfazer uma interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o evolutiva do pr\u00f3prio corpo lodoso. A maior resolu\u00e7\u00e3o temporal dos \n\ndep\u00f3sitos deste corpo sedimentar possibilitou, por sua vez, reconstruir mais detalhadamente \n\nos sucessivos paleoambientes e, por conseguinte, a hist\u00f3ria evolutiva da regi\u00e3o. \n\nOs padr\u00f5es deposicionais ao longo da plataforma revelaram que ambos os ambientes foram \n\nsempre fortemente condicionados pelas varia\u00e7\u00f5es no contributo sedimentar do Rio Guadiana \n\ne pela evolu\u00e7\u00e3o geomorfol\u00f3gica do seu sistema estuarino, sendo que na \u00e1rea da plataforma \n\ninterna foi tamb\u00e9m detetada uma forte influ\u00eancia dos processos de fornecimento e \n\n\n\nviii \n\t\n \u00a0\n\nredistribui\u00e7\u00e3o associados \u00e0 deriva litoral. No caso espec\u00edfico do corpo lodoso, o registo \n\nsedimentar permitiu detetar esta tend\u00eancia previamente ao Holoc\u00e9nico, isto \u00e9, desde o final do \n\nPleistoc\u00e9nico e, em concreto, desde cerca dos 15,000 anos (cal. B.P.). \n\nDurante o final do Pleistoc\u00e9nico e in\u00edcio do Holoc\u00e9nico, o impacto da r\u00e1pida subida do \n\nn\u00edvel m\u00e9dio do mar que marcou o per\u00edodo p\u00f3s-glaciar sobrep\u00f4s-se claramente aos outros \n\nmecanismos for\u00e7adores, induzindo uma sucess\u00e3o espec\u00edfica de paleoambientes \u00e0 medida que \n\nia submergindo extensas \u00e1reas da plataforma, com o local analisado da plataforma interna \n\ncorrespondendo ent\u00e3o a um ambiente deltaico diretamente ligado \u00e0 desembocadura do rio, \n\nenquanto os locais mais distais da atual plataforma m\u00e9dia estariam situados num ambiente \n\npouco profundo de plataforma interna. Esta sucess\u00e3o ficou claramente registada nas \n\nsequ\u00eancias, quer da plataforma interna, quer do corpo lodoso, atrav\u00e9s da tend\u00eancia \n\ntransgressiva dos dep\u00f3sitos, bem como da diminui\u00e7\u00e3o gradual de componentes espec\u00edficos da \n\nareia (outros terr\u00edgenos sem ser quartzo \u2013 OT, e fragmentos litocl\u00e1sticos associados aos \n\nafloramentos rochosos da Bacia do Guadiana) e de gr\u00e3os de quartzo pouco evolu\u00eddos (NU) \n\nque servem como indiciadores de maior proximidade \u00e0 desembocadura do rio. O pr\u00f3prio \n\nprocesso de preenchimento sedimentar do estu\u00e1rio, intimamente ligado \u00e0 transgress\u00e3o \n\nmarinha, reteve uma parte consider\u00e1vel do material transportado pelo rio. A partir de cerca \n\ndos 8,200-7,700 anos, a maior parte dos sedimentos mais grosseiros foi retido dentro do \n\nestu\u00e1rio e apenas os sedimentos em suspens\u00e3o continuaram a ser transferidos para a costa e \n\nplataforma adjacente. De igual forma, as faunas de foramin\u00edferos bent\u00f3nicos do corpo lodoso \n\nforam ainda mais reveladoras desta evolu\u00e7\u00e3o. As densidades faun\u00edsticas aumentaram \n\nsignificativamente, acompanhando a transi\u00e7\u00e3o para ambientes mais profundos e est\u00e1veis, \n\nenquanto as esp\u00e9cies tipicamente adaptadas a ambientes costeiros \u2013 tais como Asterigerinata \n\nmamilla, Cribrononion gerthi, Gavelinopsis praegeri e Bulimina elongata \u2013 que dominaram \n\nos dep\u00f3sitos mais antigos, foram posteriormente substitu\u00eddas de forma gradual por esp\u00e9cies \n\ncom prefer\u00eancia ecol\u00f3gica por ambientes eutr\u00f3ficos menos hidrodin\u00e2micos e substratos mais \n\nfinos \u2013 tais como Cassidulina laeviata, Bolivina ordinaria e Brizalina dilatata \u2013 t\u00edpicos das \n\n\u00e1reas mais profundas da plataforma. No entanto, \u00e9 importante salientar que mesmo durante \n\nesta fase transgressiva, quantidades significativas de material fino j\u00e1 tinham come\u00e7ado a \n\nchegar \u00e0 \u00e1rea onde entretanto se estabeleceu o corpo lodoso do Guadiana, querendo tal dizer \n\nque o abastecimentos fluvial de finos nunca foi interrompido, inclusive durante os est\u00e1dios \n\niniciais e mais acelerados de preenchimento estuarino. \n\nAp\u00f3s a relativa estabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o do n\u00edvel do m\u00e9dio no mar na regi\u00e3o por volta dos 5,500 anos \n\n(cal. B.P.), e o processo de preenchimento sedimentar do estu\u00e1rio do Guadiana praticamente \n\n\n\nix \n\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\n\nconclu\u00eddo, as sequ\u00eancias sedimentares revelaram que outros fatores globais e regionais \n\ntornaram-se determinantes para o controlo do fornecimento de sedimentos e nutrientes \u00e0 \n\nplataforma, nomeadamente as oscila\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas de escala milenar e centen\u00e1ria que \n\ncaracterizaram o Atl\u00e2ntico Norte durante o Holoc\u00e9nico, e os impactes das a\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nantropog\u00e9nicas \u00e0 escala regional. Neste contexto, o facto das taxas m\u00e9dias de sedimenta\u00e7\u00e3o na \n\nplataforma n\u00e3o terem aparentemente revelado nenhum incremento significativo at\u00e9 perto dos \n\ncerca de 2,500-2,000 anos (cal. B.P.), mesmo ap\u00f3s o preenchimento do estu\u00e1rio estar \n\npraticamente conclu\u00eddo, pode ter resultado da combina\u00e7\u00e3o de dois fatores principais. Por um \n\nlado, o clima mais quente e h\u00famido que ter\u00e1 caracterizado o in\u00edcio do Holoc\u00e9nico e que ter\u00e1 \n\ncontribu\u00eddo para o desenvolvimento de uma extensa cobertura vegetal, ter\u00e1 conferido prote\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndos solos \u00e0 eros\u00e3o e ajudado a retardar o aumento expect\u00e1vel do transporte sedimentar fluvial \n\ne consequente amplia\u00e7\u00e3o das transfer\u00eancias para a plataforma. A tend\u00eancia de aridifica\u00e7\u00e3o que \n\nse ter\u00e1 verificado a partir de cerca dos 5,000-4,000 anos (cal. B.P.) em toda a bacia do \n\nMediterr\u00e2neo e que tamb\u00e9m afetou o Vale do Guadiana, embora causando modifica\u00e7\u00f5es no \n\ncoberto vegetal, ter\u00e1 implicado simultaneamente uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o importante do caudal fluvial e, \n\ncom isso, redu\u00e7\u00e3o do transporte sedimentar. Por outro lado, a estabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o do n\u00edvel do mar \n\npr\u00f3ximo ao atual possibilitou o in\u00edcio da constru\u00e7\u00e3o do delta submarino do Guadiana junto \u00e0 \n\nsua desembocadura, num sistema onde os processos de fornecimento s\u00e3o tipicamente \n\nsuperiores aos de redistribui\u00e7\u00e3o devido \u00e0s condi\u00e7\u00f5es gerais de baixo hidrodinamismo da \n\nplataforma do Guadiana, o que ter\u00e1 sido respons\u00e1vel pela reten\u00e7\u00e3o continuada de uma parte \n\nconsider\u00e1vel dos sedimentos transportados pelo rio. As faunas de foramin\u00edferos do corpo \n\nlodoso constitu\u00edram o indicador que melhor registou esta tend\u00eancia evolutiva do sistema \n\ndeposicional, com flutua\u00e7\u00f5es nas abund\u00e2ncias relativas de algumas esp\u00e9cies consideradas \n\nmais oportunistas \u2013 como C. laevigata and B. dilatata - a apontarem para um impacto \n\nreduzido de descargas excessivas de nutrientes fornecidos pelo rio. \n\nH\u00e1 cerca de 2,500-2,000 anos (cal. B.P.), registaram-se profundas altera\u00e7\u00f5es deposicionais \n\ne ecol\u00f3gicas nos dois ambientes da plataforma, apontando para transforma\u00e7\u00f5es significativas \n\nna \u00e1rea-fonte, ou seja, na Bacia hidrogr\u00e1fica do Guadiana. Grandes quantidades de \n\nsedimentos come\u00e7aram a chegar a plataforma e, em particular, verificou-se grande incremento \n\nde material fino. No local da plataforma interna, este aumento de finos traduziu-se por \n\neventos deposicionais espec\u00edficos intercalados nos sedimentos predominantemente arenosos, \n\ntendo sido interpretados como o registo de per\u00edodos marcados pela ocorr\u00eancia de importantes \n\ncheias fluviais. No corpo lodoso, a fra\u00e7\u00e3o fina passou a constituir mais de 90% dos dep\u00f3sitos \n\ne estendeu-se inclusive a outras zonas mais afastadas da linha direta de fornecimento do \n\n\n\nx \n\t\n \u00a0\n\nGuadiana, o que claramente marcou o desenvolvimento definitivo deste corpo sedimentar na \n\nplataforma m\u00e9dia. A causa principal do desencadeamento de tais mudan\u00e7as estar\u00e1 ligada \u00e0s \n\nOcupa\u00e7\u00f5es Romana e Isl\u00e2mica da Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica, as quais envolveram grandes \n\nmodifica\u00e7\u00f5es nos padr\u00f5es de uso do solo, em particular de toda a regi\u00e3o sul da Pen\u00ednsula, \n\nonde extensas \u00e1reas foram convertidas ao cultivo intensivo, para al\u00e9m da intensifica\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nexplora\u00e7\u00e3o mineira e da pr\u00f3pria explora\u00e7\u00e3o dos recursos florestais para diversos fins \n\ncomerciais. Todas estas atividades, embora tenham contribu\u00eddo largamente para o \n\ndesenvolvimento da regi\u00e3o, envolveram a destrui\u00e7\u00e3o significativa da cobertura vegetal, tendo \n\ndesencadeado fen\u00f3menos erosivos sem precedentes que estar\u00e3o na origem das mudan\u00e7as \n\nambientais registadas na plataforma, e no corpo lodoso em particular, ao serem respons\u00e1veis \n\npelo aumento significativo da carga sedimentar transportada pelo rio. Por outro lado, este \n\nper\u00edodo poder\u00e1 ter correspondido a uma fase particularmente h\u00famida dentro do quadro geral \n\nde aridez que caracterizou a Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica nos \u00faltimos cerca de 5,000 anos, designado por \n\nalguns autores como Per\u00edodo H\u00famido Romano Ib\u00e9rico. Uma oscila\u00e7\u00e3o clim\u00e1tica no sentido de \n\nmaiores n\u00edveis de precipita\u00e7\u00e3o, aliada \u00e0 intensa eros\u00e3o desencadeada na Bacia do Guadiana \n\npelas atividades humanas j\u00e1 referidas, ter\u00e1 sido determinante na mudan\u00e7a dos padr\u00f5es \n\ndeposicionais da plataforma. Este impacto foi revelado igualmente pelas faunas de \n\nforamin\u00edferos bent\u00f3nicos, nas quais o estabelecimento ou aumento de determinadas esp\u00e9cies \u2013 \n\ntais como Epistominella exigua, Valvulineria bradyana e Bulimina marginata \u2013 traduziu de \n\nforma evidente a cria\u00e7\u00e3o de novos nichos ecol\u00f3gicos dentro do corpo lodoso como resposta \u00e0s \n\naltera\u00e7\u00f5es no fornecimento fluvial. Adicionalmente, este incremento nas descargas fluviais \n\npoder\u00e1 ter acelerado a evolu\u00e7\u00e3o geomorfol\u00f3gica natural da desembocadura do Guadiana e \n\nsido respons\u00e1vel pela colmata\u00e7\u00e3o de um antigo distribut\u00e1rio oriental do rio, o qual \u00e9 \n\nreferenciado em fontes hist\u00f3ricas de h\u00e1 pelo menos cerca de 2,000 anos. Tal processo ter\u00e1 \n\nconduzido, por sua vez, ao refor\u00e7o do distribut\u00e1rio ocidental, hoje correspondente ao canal \n\nprincipal do rio e que fornece diretamente a \u00e1rea da plataforma onde foram colhidas as \n\nsequ\u00eancias sedimentares analisadas. \n\nAp\u00f3s o per\u00edodo h\u00famido Romano, e at\u00e9 h\u00e1 cerca de 300 anos, os indicadores \n\npaleoambientais apontaram para a persist\u00eancia do sinal clim\u00e1tico de aridez na regi\u00e3o da Bacia \n\ndo Guadiana, o que \u00e9 consistente com a informa\u00e7\u00e3o dispon\u00edvel para outros locais do sul da \n\nEuropa. A aridifica\u00e7\u00e3o de toda esta regi\u00e3o ter\u00e1 sido muito provavelmente for\u00e7ada, em grande \n\nparte, pela a\u00e7\u00e3o da Oscila\u00e7\u00e3o do Atl\u00e2ntico Norte (NAO), a qual controla os trajetos do sistema \n\nde tempestades do Atl\u00e2ntico Norte e, por conseguinte, a maior ou menor \n\nhumidade/precipita\u00e7\u00e3o disponibilizada \u00e0 Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica. Tal justificaria a aus\u00eancia do \n\n\n\nxi \n\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\n\nregisto de cheias nos dep\u00f3sitos da plataforma interna que foi verificado durante uma grande \n\nparte deste per\u00edodo. N\u00e3o obstante, quantidades elevadas de sedimentos finos continuaram a \n\nser fornecidas ao corpo lodoso, o que ter\u00e1 sido sintom\u00e1tico da continua\u00e7\u00e3o do impacte \n\nhumano na regi\u00e3o, pelo menos durante toda a Idade M\u00e9dia. \n\nOs \u00faltimos 300 anos de deposi\u00e7\u00e3o continuaram a ser fortemente marcados pelo intenso \n\nfornecimento de sedimentos finos, com um incremento particularmente significativo no local \n\nestudado da plataforma interna, e pela deposi\u00e7\u00e3o de material terr\u00edgeno no corpo lodoso, \n\nindiciador do incremento dos impactes das cheias fluviais. Esta tend\u00eancia foi atribu\u00edda a uma \n\nliga\u00e7\u00e3o ainda mais estreita entre os fatores clim\u00e1ticos e os antropog\u00e9nicos. A ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nhumana prolongada da Bacia do Guadiana foi acentuada durante o s\u00e9culo XIX, com um novo \n\ndesenvolvimento da atividade mineira ao longo da Faixa Piritosa Ib\u00e9rica (devido \u00e0 lenha \n\nnecess\u00e1ria para o processo de ustula\u00e7\u00e3o) e das pr\u00e1ticas agr\u00edcolas, ambas com fortes impactes \n\nno uso do solo e nas taxas de eros\u00e3o. Simultaneamente, este per\u00edodo correspondeu \u00e0 fase mais \n\nacentuada do evento clim\u00e1tico conhecido como \u2018Pequena Idade do Gelo\u2019, que afetou toda a \n\nregi\u00e3o do Atl\u00e2ntico Norte e esteve associado com um \u00edndice negativo mais persistente da \n\nOscila\u00e7\u00e3o do Atl\u00e2ntico Norte. Valores negativos persistentes do \u00edndice foram j\u00e1 reconhecidos \n\ncomo o principal mecanismo respons\u00e1vel por um aumento da humidade e da precipita\u00e7\u00e3o em \n\ntoda a regi\u00e3o sudoeste da Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica. A a\u00e7\u00e3o conjunta da amplifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos processos \n\nerosivos derivados das atividades humanas com o aumento significativo dos caudais do Rio \n\nGuadiana devido \u00e0 oscila\u00e7\u00e3o do clima, aparenta ter sido o mecanismo respons\u00e1vel pela maior \n\nexporta\u00e7\u00e3o de sedimentos do continente para o dom\u00ednio marinho e pelos padr\u00f5es \n\ndeposicionais mais recentes detetados na plataforma. \n\n \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\nxiii \n\t\n \u00a0\n\nContents \n\nAgradecimentos\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\u2026\u2026i \n\nResumo\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...v \n\nAbstract\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.vi \n\nResumo alargado\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\u2026\u2026\u2026.vii \n\nContents\u2026\u2026\u2026...\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...xiii \n\nList of figures..........................................................................................................................xvi \n\nList of tables.............................................................................................................................xx \n\n \n\nChapter I \u2013 Introduction..........................................................................................................1 \n\nI.1.

Introduction \n\nII.1. Motivation and general setting of the study \n\nContinental shelves have been assuming growing importance in palaeoclimatic and \n\npalaeoceanographic research studies as they constitute key-transfer areas between continental \n\nand marine environments (e.g., Nittrouer and Wright, 1994; Kineke et al., 1996; Jouanneau et \n\nal., 1998; Sommerfield and Nittrouer, 1999; Ara\u00fajo et al., 2002; Dias et al., 2002; Roussiez et \n\nal., 2005; Dubrulle et al., 2007), their deposits having high potential for registering past \n\nenvironmental changes such as sea-level variations, climatic events and the more recent \n\nanthropogenic impact on natural systems (e.g., Rodero et al., 1999; Lobo et al., 2001; \n\nEdwards, 2002; Hanebuth and Stattegger, 2004; Abrantes et al., 2005; Alt-Epping et al., \n\n2009). In particular, the mud deposits that can form in shelf areas adjacent to relevant \n\nsediment fluvial sources have become increasingly important to the understanding of \n\nHolocene environmental shifts. Their moderate to high sedimentation rates usually generate a \n\nmore continuous record than other areas of the shelf and thus allow an interpretation of events \n\nwith a millennial, centennial, and sometimes even decadal, time-scale resolution (e.g., \n\nLesueur et al., 1996; Sommerfield and Wheatcraft, 2007; Burdloff et al., 2008; Lantzsch et \n\nal., 2009a; Nizou et al., 2010; Rosa et al., 2011; Mendes et al., 2012b; Oberle et al., 2014). \n\nOn the northern Gulf of Cadiz Margin, a number of studies have been conducted \n\nthroughout the past years in order to try to understand the shelf main depositional patterns, \n\nand their past evolution in relation to several forcing mechanisms, including the postglacial \n\nsea-level rise, estuarine infilling, oceanographic shifts, changes in fluvial-sediment supply and \n\nclimate (e.g., L\u00f3pez-Galindo et al., 1999; Maldonado and Nelson, 1999; Nelson et al., 1999; \n\nRodero et al., 1999; Sierro et al., 1999; Guti\u00e9rrez-Mas et al., 2003; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2004; \n\nLobo et al., 2004; Lobo et al., 2005; Mendes et al., 2010; Rosa et al., 2011). Additionally, the \n\nHolocene infilling of the Guadiana Estuary is well documented (Boski et al., 2002; Boski et \n\nal., 2008), which is crucial to understand past changes in the fluvial input onto the nearby \n\nshelf as the river is its main regional sediment source. The river runoff is itself extremely \n\nsusceptible to variations in precipitation and to climatic oscillations such as those related with \n\nthe North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) (Dias et al., 2004; Trigo et al., 2004), whereas the \n\nnarrow and bedrock-controlled morphology of the estuary determines a very efficient fluvial-\n\nexport towards the coast (e.g., Lobo et al., 2003), with flood events being the main sediment-\n\ntransfer mechanism from the continent to the shelf (Portela, 2004; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2007). The \n\nmajority of sediments that bypass the estuary mouth to the shelf correspond to suspended-load \n\n(Morales, 1997; Portela, 2004). This material tends to be re-suspended from the shallower \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n \n\n3 \nChapter I. Introduction \n\nareas close to the river mouth and of the inner shelf by storm- and wave-activity, being \n\ntransported offshore and eventually setting on the deeper middle shelf environment, where the \n\nlower hydrodynamic levels allow its deposition (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2007). Here they have \n\nformed an important mud patch, which is part of the larger muddy deposits that cover a \n\nsignificant portion of the northern Gulf of Cadiz Margin, and constitute a highstand system \n\ntrack largely formed after the sea-level rise deceleration in mid-Holocene times (Nelson et al., \n\n1999; Lobo et al., 2004; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2004). \n\nThe Guadiana mud body has been part of the focus of a few investigations, mainly \n\nconcerning its geochemical signature and relation to historical human-derived sources of \n\npollutants along the river basin (Corredeira et al., 2008), changes in the supply of organic \n\ncarbon during the Holocene (Burdloff et al., 2008), the coupling of natural and anthropogenic \n\nimpacts in the overall shelf system (Mendes et al., 2012b), and a first insight on the general \n\nmechanisms behind its formation on the middle shelf (Rosa et al., 2011). However, an \n\nintegrated study focusing specifically on the depositional mechanisms that led to its \n\nestablishment and development on the middle shelf was yet lacking. \n\nOn the other hand, the recognition of the Iberian Peninsula as a region of strong climatic \n\nasymmetries due to its geographical position that places it under the combined influence of \n\nthe Atlantic and the Mediterranean (e.g., Castro-D\u00edez et al., 2002; Goodess and Jones, 2002; \n\nMartin-Vide and Lopez-Bustins, 2006), sets the Guadiana region itself as a key-location to try \n\nto understand the climatic complexity of the Holocene period in the context of the North \n\nAtlantic climate variability. Furthermore, the long-term human occupation of the Guadiana \n\nBasin has caused a profound and continued impact on the landscape (e.g., Devy-Vareta, 1985; \n\nChester and James, 1999; Boone and Worman, 2007), changing erosional processes and thus \n\ncontributing to variations on the shelf sediment supply and amount of nutrients transported by \n\nthe river to the ocean. As such, it is expectable that a strong interplay between natural and \n\nhuman forcing factors has helped to definitely shape the region throughout the past millennia. \n\nTaking into account this overall scenario, and the high-potential of the Guadiana mud body \n\nto register in detail the past climatic and environmental anthropogenic changes that affected \n\nthe region for the last millennia, urged an integrated approach that allowed understanding the \n\nformation and evolution of the mud body as a specific depositional and ecological shelf \n\ndomain, and at the same time enabled its use as a high-resolution palaeoenvironmental tool to \n\nreconstruct the Holocene climatic and anthropogenic history of this semi-arid region within \n\nthe North Atlantic. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \nChapter I. Introduction \n\nII.2. Main goals \n\nHence considering the potential relevance that the sedimentary dynamics of the continental \n\nshelf off the Guadiana River assumes to understand the climatic contrasts along the North \n\nAtlantic, and of the middle shelf mud body as a high-resolution archive of past environmental \n\nchanges, the main goals of the present work were the following: \n\n1 - To identify the main depositional events occurred in the shelf environment during the \n\nlate Pleistocene and Holocene and correlate them with sea-level changes and climatic \n\noscillations that affected the region, based on a detailed sedimentological approach coupled \n\nwith the analysis of the benthic foraminiferal faunas that colonized the middle shelf mud \n\nbody, framed in a chronology obtained by radiocarbon dating (14C); \n\n2 \u2013 To determine variations in the sedimentary supplies of the Guadiana River onto the \n\nshelf system through the analysis of changes occurred in the apparent sedimentation rates, in \n\nthe main compounds of the sand-sized sediments (coarse-fraction analysis), in the shape and \n\nsurface texture of quartz grains and in the species composition of the benthic foraminifera. \n\nLink these variations to important climatic events, using the Guadiana-case as an example of \n\nthe impact of fluvial systems on the adjacent coastal and marine environment in semi-arid \n\nregions of the North Atlantic; \n\n3 - To relate the evolution of the Guadiana Estuary with modifications detected in the \n\ndepositional patterns of the shelf, by comparing the data obtained in this study for the inner \n\nshelf and mid-shelf mud body sedimentary sequences with previous information obtained by \n\nother authors with the analysis of sequences collected inside the estuary; \n\n4 \u2013 To evaluate the impact of Holocene climatic oscillations, particularly at an historical \n\ntime-scale, in the overall sediment supply to the shelf and in the establishment of specific \n\necological niches for the benthic foraminiferal faunas, using the mud body deposits as the \n\nmain tool. To identify the more recent anthropogenic impact on the shelf depositional system, \n\nand the role played by human-induced changes coupled with the late Holocene climatic \n\nevents, including those related with the specific NAO-index signal, in the evolution of the \n\nnatural systems of the region; \n\n5 \u2013 To reconstruct the evolutional history of the mud body and relate it with the evolution \n\nof the Guadiana region itself, in the context of the North Atlantic postglacial climatic and \n\nenvironmental changes. \n\n \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n \n\n5 \nChapter I. Introduction \n\nII.3. Thesis outline \n\nThe thesis has a structure composed by eight Chapters, preceded by two short Abstracts \n\n(one in English, the other in Portuguese) and an Extended Abstract (in Portuguese), and \n\nfollowed by the References section and three Appendices (A to C). \n\nThe content of each of those chapters is briefly summarized as follows. \n\nChapter I \u2013 Corresponds to a general introduction of the thesis itself, presenting the \n\nmotivation for the study, the main aims and goals of the work, and its general outline. \n\nChapter II \u2013 Consists of a broad description and framing of the study area, focusing on its \n\nlocation, general climate and oceanography, main features of the continental shelf and \n\npostglacial evolution of its deposits, sea-level variations, Holocene climate change and the \n\nmore recent human impact in the region. \n\nChapter III \u2013 Describes the materials and methods that were used in order to achieve the \n\nmain goals established for the thesis work. \n\nChapter IV \u2013 Presents the sedimentological results of the inner shelf sedimentary \n\nsequence, its palaeoenvironmental interpretation, an approach on the climatic and \n\nanthropogenic forcing over the evolution of the deposits, and a summary which includes a \n\nsynthesis-table of events. \n\nChapter V \u2013 Presents the sedimentological and micropalaeontological results of the \n\nmiddle shelf mud body sedimentary sequences, their palaeoenvironmental interpretation, \n\nan approach on the climatic and anthropogenic forcing over the evolution of the deposits, \n\nand a summary which includes a synthesis-table of events. \n\nChapter VI \u2013 Presents a general palaeoenvironmental reconstruction for the continental \n\nshelf based on the integration of the results and interpretation of the two previous chapters, \n\nwith a main focus on the evolution and characterization of the mud body. \n\nChapter VII \u2013 Provides the main findings and conclusions obtained with the thesis \n\nresearch work. \n\nChapter VIII \u2013 Focuses on the taxonomy of the mud body benthic foraminifera, \n\ncontaining its detailed systematic and a set of five plates that feature scanning electron \n\nmicroscope (SEM) photographs of several important taxa, including of all the main benthic \n\nspecies used for multivariate statistical analysis and determination of the biofacies. \n\n\n\n6 \nChapter I.

Study area \n\nII.1. General location \n\nThe study area is located on the inner- to middle-shelf adjacent to the Guadiana River \n\nMouth, with the river and its estuary constituting a natural border between Portugal and Spain \n\n(Fig. II.1). \n\nThe continental shelf off the Guadiana River is located in the northern part of the Gulf of \n\nCadiz, a large basin that is placed in the northeast Atlantic Ocean, along the southwestern \n\nmargin of the Iberian Peninsula, extending from Cape S\u00e3o Vicente (on the west) to the Strait \n\nof Gibraltar (on the east), the latter setting the connection to the Mediterranean Sea (Fig. II.1).  \n\n \nFigure II.1 \u2013 Map of the Gulf of Cadiz region and general location of the study area. \n\n \n\nThe basin is positioned near the eastern end of the Azores-Gibraltar Fracture Zone, which \n\nis part of the Eurasia-Africa plate boundary, and since late Miocene when N-S to NNW-SSE \n\nconvergence movements took place between Iberia and Africa, the region has remained \n\nseismically-active, under convergence (e.g., Torelli et al., 1997; Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003; \n\nMedialdea et al., 2004). \n\nDue to its geographic position and in terms of ecological setting, the Gulf of Cadiz basin is \n\na transitional area that divides the North Atlantic Coastal Province into the European and the \n\nAfrican sectors, constituting a relatively warm and oligotrophic pelagic system that interrupts \n\nthe seasonal fringe of cold, nutrient-rich, upwelled waters coming from the west part of the \n\nbasin (Garcia-Lafuente et al., 2006; Garcia-Lafuente and Ruiz, 2007). \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n \n\n9 \nChapter II. Study area \n \n\nII.2. Regional climate \n\nThe Iberian Peninsula, together with the whole of the Western Mediterranean Basin, form \n\na transitional climatic region where Atlantic and Mediterranean influences meet and imprint \n\nspecific low-frequency variability patterns (e.g., Ribeiro, 1945; Martin-Vide and Lopez-\n\nBustins, 2006). \n\nThe climate that characterizes the study area is though clearly of Mediterranean influence \n\n(Ribeiro, 1945; Loureiro and Coutinho, 1995), with the Guadiana River draining a semi-arid \n\nregion and its runoff being characterized by high seasonal and inter-annual variability (Cunha, \n\n1983; Loureiro et al., 1986; Dias et al., 2004; Trigo et al., 2004). The mean annual rainfall in \n\nthe Algarve along the hydrological year has been further described as distributed by three \n\ndifferent periods, namely rainy (October-February), transitional (March-May) and dry (June-\n\nSeptember) (Loureiro and Coutinho, 1995).  \n\nThese general climate trends have been found to be further defined by the North Atlantic \n\nOscillation (NAO), which is the leading pattern of climate and winter surface variability over \n\nthe North Atlantic (Hurrell, 1995; Visbeck et al., 2001) (Fig. II.2).  \n\n \nFigure II.2 \u2013 Model of the two modes of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), associated storminess activity and distribution \nof moisture over the North Atlantic: a) negative and b) positive NAO index phases. H \u2013 Subtropical High Pressure Centre, L \n\u2013 Icelandic Low Pressure Centre (adapted from http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/pi/NAO/). \n\n \nThe winter (December-March) station-based index of the NAO is frequently calculated on \n\nbasis of the difference of normalized sea-level pressure between Lisbon (Portugal) (although \n\nPonta Delgada-Azores and Gibraltar have also been used) and Stykkisholmur/Reykjavik \n\n(Iceland) since 1864 (e.g., Hurrell and Van Loon, 1997; Hurrell and Deser, 2010). In general \n\n\n\n10 \nChapter II. Study area \n\nterms, the NAO refers to a redistribution of atmospheric mass between the Arctic and the \n\nsubtropical Atlantic basin, and shifts from one phase to another, producing large changes in \n\nsurface air temperature, winds, storminess and precipitation over the Atlantic (e.g., Hurrell \n\nand Deser, 2010) (Fig. II.2). Anomalies in precipitation, including dry wintertime conditions \n\nover southern Europe and the Mediterranean, and wetter-than-normal conditions over \n\nnorthern Europe and Scandinavia, have also been linked to the behavior of the NAO (Hurrell \n\nand Van Loon, 1997) (Fig. II.2). Positive values of the NAO index are typically associated \n\nwith stronger-than-average westerlies over the middle latitudes, more intense weather systems \n\nover the North Atlantic and wetter/milder weather over western Europe, whereas negative \n\nindex values usually associate with stronger westerlies and enhanced moisture over low-\n\nlatitudes and the Mediterranean (e.g., Hurrell and Deser, 2010) (Fig. II.2). \n\nIn the Iberian Peninsula, the winter precipitation and moisture availability are indeed \n\nlargely modulated by the NAO index (Corte-Real et al., 1998; Rodriguez-Puebla et al., 1998; \n\nGoodess and Jones, 2002; Trigo et al., 2004; Martin-Vide and Lopez-Bustins, 2006). \n\nSpecifically, in the Guadiana River Basin, pervasive NAO negative-phases are known for \n\ninducing higher precipitation and stronger river flows whereas the opposite occurs during \n\npervasive NAO positive-phases (Dias et al., 2004; Trigo et al., 2004). \n\n \n\nII.3. Continental shelf off the Guadiana River \n\nII.3.1. Physiography \n\nThe Guadiana shelf stands in a transitional zone between the narrow and relatively steep \n\nWest Portuguese shelf, with a mean width of 5 km and a slope of ca. 0.5\u00ba, and the north-\n\neastern corner of the Gulf of Cadiz where the shelf is more than 30 km wide off the \n\nGuadalquivir River mouth and has gentle slopes of less than 0.2\u00ba (e.g., Lobo et al., 2001). \n\nThe study area can be divided into three main morphological provinces, namely the inner \n\nshelf, the smooth middle shelf and the outer shelf (Nelson et al., 1999). \n\nOff the Guadiana River, the shelf break lies at around 140\u2013150 m water depth (Baldy, \n\n1977; Vanney and Mougenot, 1981) and the mean slope is 0.32\u00ba (Roque, 1998; Lobo et al., \n\n2001). The middle shelf is located between ca. 30-50 and 90-100 m water depths with slopes \n\nof 0.35\u00ba to 0.49\u00ba (e.g., Nelson et al., 1999; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2004). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n \n\n11 \nChapter II. Study area \n \n\nII.3.2. Oceanographic setting \n\nII.3.2.1. Hydrodynamics \n\nThe surface circulation in the Gulf of Cadiz is integrated into the general circulation of the \n\nNortheast Atlantic, having the Azores current, which feeds the Canary Current, frequently \n\nforming meanders that separate from the main flow (Alves et al., 2002). The circulation \n\nwithin the Gulf of Cadiz thus constitutes the last meander of the Azores current, part of which \n\nenters the Mediterranean Sea through the Strait of Gibraltar to balance evaporation and \n\nbuoyancy losses within this sea (Criado-Aldeanueva et al., 2006). \n\nIn general terms, the surface circulation is anticyclonic with short, meteorologically-\n\ninduced, variations, and the North Atlantic Central Water (NACW) occupies the water masses \n\nof the upper 1,000 m of the water column (Criado-Aldeanueva et al., 2006). Two surface \n\ncoastal variations of the NACW have been furthermore identified, the Atlantic Water (SAW) \n\nand the Warm Shelf Waters (SW), the first being originated in shallow waters that are \n\nmodified by air-sea interactions, and the latter being detected mainly over the continental \n\nshelf and characterized by the influence of continental processes, including heating and \n\nfreshwater inputs from land (Criado-Aldeanueva et al., 2006). \n\nThe anticyclonic gyre is permanent in the open sea but interrupted on the continental shelf \n\nduring the spring-summer season, when a more complex circulation pattern is established, \n\nwith two different cells of cyclonic circulation forming both to the east and to the west of \n\nCape Santa Maria (Garc\u00eda-Lafuente et al., 2006; Garc\u00eda-Lafuente and Ruiz, 2007) (Fig. II.3). \n\nIn the western sector the cell is linked to open-sea and upwelling processes, whereas in the \n\neastern sector coastal processes dominate (Garc\u00eda-Lafuente et al., 2006; Garc\u00eda-Lafuente and \n\nRuiz, 2007). As a consequence, on the Guadiana shelf, the south-eastward Atlantic inflow \n\ncurrents that control the dislocation of water masses over the continental margin are opposed \n\nby a counter-current flowing westwards along the inner shelf and close to the coast (Folkard \n\net al., 1997; Relvas and Barton, 2002; Garc\u00eda-Lafuente et al., 2006) (Fig. II.3). On the \n\nwestern sector, oceanographic conditions are strongly influenced by the almost permanent \n\nupwelling phenomena occurring off Cape S\u00e3o Vicente, triggered by the wind-stress curl \n\n(Fi\u00faza, 1983; Vargas et al., 2003). Westerly winds are the main driven-mechanism for this \n\nupwelling and can occasionally create a second upwelling core off Cape Santa Maria, which \n\nweakens and even disappears when wind-stress shifts to easterlies (e.g., Vargas et al., 2003). \n\nThese upwelling events may also be responsible for further primary production by vertical \n\nadvection of nitrogen, which can be up to two orders of magnitude higher than production \n\n\n\n12 \nChapter II. Study area \n\nmaintained by vertical diffusion (Ruiz and Navarro, 2006). On the eastern sector, easterly \n\nwinds favour the seasonal appearance of the previously mentioned warm costal counter \n\ncurrent, which may in some cases, when wind-stress is strong enough, extend and invade the \n\nwestern sector, connecting both sectors and often turning poleward around Cape S\u00e3o Vicente \n\n(e.g., Relvas and Barton, 2002; Garcia-Lafuente et al., 2006; Garcia-Lafuente and Ruiz, 2007; \n\nRelvas et al., 2007). \n\n \nFigure II.3 \u2013 Surface water mass circulation on the continental shelf of the Gulf of Cadiz. N1 was identified with the Huelva \nFront, N2 as a branch of the Portuguese-Canary eastern boundary current, CVE as the cyclonic eddy off Cape S\u00e3o Vicente, \nand CCC as the coastal counter current active to the east of Cape Santa Maria (adapted from Garc\u00eda-Lafuente et al., 2006). \n \n\nConcerning the hydrodynamic regime, the study area is characterized by semi-diurnal tides \n\nwith average ranges of 1.3 m and 2.8 m for neap and spring tides, respectively, although \n\nmaximum ranges of 3.5 m can be reached during the latter. Wave climate is moderate to high \n\n(Ciavola et al., 1997), with an average offshore significant wave height of 0.92 m (Costa et \n\nal., 2001). Incident waves from the W-SW are dominant, representing 71% of occurrences \n\n(Costa et al., 2001) and generating an eastward directed longshore transport. \u2018Levante\u2019 \n\nconditions (short period waves generated by SE Mediterranean wind) represent 23% of the \n\ntotal occurrences (Costa et al., 2001). Storm events in the area have been defined as events \n\nwith offshore significant wave heights greater than 3 m (Pessanha and Pires, 1981). The \n\nestablishment of return periods for the main incident wave directions indicates that SW \n\nstorms are more energetic than SE storms for the same return period (Pires, 1998). However, \n\nthe cuspate shape of the Portuguese coast generates different areas in terms of exposure to \n\nwave action, with the eastern section that extends beyond the Guadiana River Mouth being \n\nrelatively protected from the more energetic W-SW waves, and more exposed to \u2018Levante\u2019 \n\nwaves. \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n \n\n13 \nChapter II. Study area \n \n\nII.3.2.2. Primary production \n\nThe highest concentrations of chlorophyll along the Gulf Cadiz region are observed in the \n\ncoastal zone between the Guadiana and the Guadalquivir river mouths, mainly driven by the \n\nnutrient-enriched fluvial discharges (Ruiz and Navarro, 2006). Additionally, local wind forces \n\nalso play a role in biological production, with westerlies enhancing chlorophyll concentration \n\nand easterlies decreasing it (Ruiz and Navarro, 2006; Prieto et al., 2009). In the coastal and \n\nshelf areas adjacent to the Guadiana River, the impact of suspended-particulate matter (SPM) \n\nand nutrients was observed particularly around the mouth of the estuary, involving the \n\ndevelopment of a fingerprint plume that represents a net export of SPM and nutrients to the \n\ncoastal area recorded  both horizontally and vertically (Cravo et al., 2006). The plume has a \n\nmean width of about 10-15 km and despite being centred slightly east of the mouth of the \n\nGuadiana River, tended to migrate westward, extending down to ca. 20 m water depth, \n\nprobably influenced by the coastal counter current that flows along the eastern shelf sector, in \n\nwhat seems to constitute a recurring event (Cravo et al., 2006). In general, during wintertime, \n\nwhen phytoplankton activity is reduced, the plume nutrient concentrations are much higher \n\nthan in the adjacent open sea (Cravo et al., 2006). \n\n \n\nII.3.3. Sediment supply and surficial distribution of sediments\t\n \u00a0\n\nThe main regional sediment source to the study area is the Guadiana River (Gonz\u00e1lez et \n\nal., 2004; Martins et al., 2012), with sediment supply from the river basin being dominated by \n\nsuspended load relative to bed load material (Morales, 1997). The second most important \n\nregional source to the shelf is the littoral drift, involving largely bed load transport (Gonz\u00e1lez \n\net al., 2004). \n\nMean river flows of the Guadiana River obtained at Pulo do Lobo Station (covering 91% \n\nof the drainage basin) for the period 1946/47 to 1999/2000 were of about 142 m3 s-1, with \n\ndistinct seasonal (winter maximum) and inter-annual variations (Portela, 2004). However, \n\ncomparison with data obtained after the construction of several dams and irrigation schemes \n\nshowed that this pattern has been disturbed. For the more recent period between 1980/81 and \n\n1999/2000, Alves et al. (2001) estimated that the river runoff was since then reduced to ca. 82 \n\nm3 s-1). Also, Dias et al. (2004) concluded that the negative correlation of a negative NAO-\n\nindex with flood frequency was r=0.81 for the period 1946-1964, and was then reduced to \n\nr=0.72 for the subsequent period 1964-1998. The estimated sediment supply from the river \n\nbasin onto the shelf for almost the same period (1946-1990) was of about 43.96x104 m3 yr-1 in \n\n\n\n14 \nChapter II. Study area \n\nterms of bed-load material and of about 57.90x104 m3 yr-1 for suspended material (Morales, \n\n1997). However, more recent studies pointed out that for low river flows the net bed-load \n\ntransport was down-estuary at spring tides, yielding an estimate of 5,400 m3 yr-1 of export \n\nseaward (Garel and Ferreira, 2011). The bulk of bed-load sediment exported by the estuary is \n\ndeposited within the 15 m bathymetric line (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2007). Winter floods, although \n\nepisodic, play a crucial role in the supply of both coarse- and fine-grained sediments from the \n\nriver to the continental shelf (Morales, 1997; Portela, 2004). In the winter of 2000/2001, field \n\nmeasurements showed that ca. 7.5-9.5x105 m3 of sand were exported from the estuary onto \n\nthe inner shelf, and at the same time fines were re-suspended on the inner shelf and re-\n\ndeposited at the upper limit of the middle shelf (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2007). The estuary itself is \n\nprolonged offshore by a submerged sandy delta (Morales, 1997), where fluvial-supplied \n\nsediments are mixed with the marine material supplied by longshore drift (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., \n\n2004). \n\nThe longshore transport of mostly sandy sediments is eastward-direct under the influence \n\nof onshore conditions that produce a net annual littoral drift around 180x103 m3 yr-1, from the \n\nsouthern Portuguese coast towards the eastern sector of the Gulf of Cadiz (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., \n\n2001) \n\nDepositional patterns indicate a predominant eastward transport of sediments under the \n\ninfluence of south-eastward Atlantic inflow currents and the littoral drift (e.g., Gutierrez-Mas \n\net al., 1994; Nelson et al., 1999; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2007), although the counter-current flowing \n\nwestward along the inner shelf and close to the coast (Folkard et al., 1997; Relvas and Barton \n\n2002; Garc\u00eda-Lafuente et al., 2006) generates a weaker westward component (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., \n\n2007). \n\nThe surficial sediment distribution on the inner shelf area down to water depths of ca. 25 m \n\nis mostly dominated by sands (Moita, 1985; Fernandez-Salas et al., 1999; Nelson et al., 1999; \n\nMagalh\u00e3es, 2001; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2004; Martins et al., 2012) (Fig. II.4). This pattern is \n\ninterrupted only by the sandy muds and muds of the prodeltaic wedge just eastward off the \n\nGuadiana Estuary mouth, and by some patches of sandy muds and muddy sands located \n\naround the bathymetric of 10-15 m, in front and deviated to the west of the river mouth \n\n(Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2004; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2007; Rosa et al., 2013) (Fig. II.4). Most of the inner \n\nshelf is dominated by terrigenous components, largely quartz, although locally bioclasts can \n\nform larger accumulations (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2004). Specifically in the vicinity of the Guadiana \n\nmouth, fluvial-supplied other terrigenous particles and molluscs concentrate down to ca. 5 m \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n \n\n15 \nChapter II. Study area \n \n\nwater depth whereas micas settle around the 10-15 m-bathymetric lines (Rosa et al., 2013). \n\nThe maximum concentrations of quartz are found mainly in the prodeltaic area, to the south of \n\nthe fluvial deltaic bulge and near the coast to the east, whilst other terrigenous accompanied \n\nby ca. 2-4% of metaschists and greywacke are very abundant on the deltaic bulge (Gonz\u00e1lez \n\net al., 2004 and 2007). \n\n \nFigure II.4 \u2013 Modern distribution of surficial sediments on the Guadiana Shelf (sediments of type 1 and 4 do not occur on the \nmapped area). Classification of sediments according to Folk (1954). (Adapted from Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2004). \n\n \n\nThe distribution of morphoscopic quartz shows that the inner shelf areas to the south and \n\neast of the Guadiana River mouth down to ca. 10 m water depth, including the deltaic bulge,  \n\ncontain large quantities of not-worn (NU) grains, followed by smooth-shining (EL) grains that \n\nincrease with water depth (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2004 and 2007) (Fig. II.5). Small patches of \n\nrounded-frosted (RM) grains occur only at transition from the inner to the middle shelf, \n\naround the bathymetric of 30 m, both to the south and to the east of the river mouth, probably \n\nassociated with subaerial exposure on the shelf during lowstand conditions  (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., \n\n2004 and 2007) (Fig. II.5). \n\n\n\n16 \nChapter II.

NU \u2013 not-worn, EL \u2013 smooth-\nshining, RM \u2013 rounded-frosted (adapted from \nGonz\u00e1lez et al., 2004). \n \n\nThe middle shelf is dominated throughout by the very fine silt and clay deposits that form \n\nthe Guadiana mud belt, extending from ca. 30-40 to 90-100 m water depths (Fernandez-Salas \n\net al., 1999; Nelson et al., 1999; Magalh\u00e3es, 2001; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2004; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., \n\n2007; Martins et al., 2012) (Fig. II.4). East of the Guadiana River Mouth, these deposits are \n\ncut by a N-S oriented bulge of transgressive coarser deposits that is composed of muddy \n\ngravelly sands and muddy sands, and stretches from ca. 20 to 100 m water depth (Gonz\u00e1lez et \n\nal., 2004 and 2007) (Fig. II.4). At the outer shelf sediments are usually an heterogeneous \n\nmixture of sands and silty clays, but some coarser deposits of sand and gravelly sand also \n\noccur near the shelf edge (Nelson et al., 1999; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2004; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2007) \n\n(Fig. II.4). Most of the sand on the middle and outer shelf is composed of grains of bioclastic \n\norigin, where foraminifera dominate but locally on the outer shelf larger amounts of mollusc \n\nshells remain, particularly in the area of the transgressive bulge (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2004 and \n\n2007). Quartz is however the dominant sand compound throughout the mid-shelf area \n\noccupied by the mud belt, in front and to the east of the Guadiana River mouth, down to ca. \n\n90 m water depth (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2004 and 2007). The morphoscopy characteristics of sandy \n\nquartz show that grains with a blunt-shining (EL) signature predominate on the middle shelf, \n\nwith varying amounts of not-worn (NU) and rounded-frosted (RM) that are higher at \n\nshallower and deeper areas, respectively (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2004; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2007) (Fig. \n\nII.5). \n\nIn general terms, the surficial distribution of sediments along the Gulf of Cadiz Margin \n\nindicate that the predominant sand- to mud-facies are in equilibrium with present-day bottom \n\ncurrents, except for the outer shelf transgressive sand facies (Nelson et al., 1999). \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n \n\n17 \nChapter II. Study area \n \n\nII.3.4. Postglacial evolution of deposits\t\n \u00a0\n\nThe late Quaternary general pattern of sedimentary facies on the Gulf of Cadiz continental \n\nshelf results from the interaction of several controlling factors that are dominated by the \n\nAtlantic inflow currents flowing southeastward across the shelf towards the Strait of Gibraltar \n\n(Nelson et al., 1999). \n\nThe evolution of deposits in the Gulf of Cadiz Margin after the last glacial maximum has \n\nbeen controlled mainly by changes in mean sea level, with sediments accumulated on the \n\nGuadiana shelf featuring related transgressive (TST) and highstand (HST) system tracks (e.g., \n\nSomoza et al., 1997; Nelson et al., 1999; Lobo et al., 2001 and 2004). The main consequence \n\nof relative sea-level variations upon the development of shelf and slope facies was the \n\nformation of the lowstand prograding slope wedge off major rivers, transgressive sand \n\ndeposits across the shelf and highstand prograding mud layers on the mid-shelf (e.g., \n\nGutierrez-Mas et al., 1996; Rodero et al., 1999; Lobo et al., 2001; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2004). \n\nThese distributional patterns have been further influenced by the full development of \n\nAtlantic inflow currents over the continental shelf and of Mediterranean outflow currents over \n\nthe slope, during the late Quaternary, when the postglacial transgression resulted in maximum \n\nwater depths over the Gibraltar sill (Nelson et al., 1999). As a result, both the shelf prodeltaic \n\ndeposits and the mid-shelf mud layers have prograted southeastward from the major river \n\nsources, forced by the inflow current system (Nelson et al., 1999). Throughout the Holocene \n\nhighstand period, sediment dispersal also seems to have been controlled by an intermittent \n\ncounter current system that depends on the wind regime (Lobo et al., 2004), as described \n\npreviously in sub-section II.3.2 (Oceanographic setting). \n\nThe transgressive deposits correspond to four parasequences that are exposed on the \n\nmiddle to the outer Guadiana shelf (Lobo et al., 2001), namely in the area of the transgressive \n\nbulge (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2004), downlapped by shelf prograding subaequous deltaic and pro-\n\ndeltaic facies of the Holocene HST (Maldonado and Nelson, 1999; Rodero et al., 1999). \n\nHowever, on the middle shelf to the south of the Guadiana Estuary, these transgressive \n\ndeposits are poorly developed and usually covered by the highstand mud deposits (Gonz\u00e1lez \n\net al., 2004). At the outer shelf edge, underlying the mid-shelf mud and inner shelf sand \n\nfacies, lays this late Pleistocene to Holocene transgressive sand sheet that was formed by the \n\neustatic shoreline advance (Nelson et al., 1999). \n\nThe highstand deposits on the Guadiana shelf form a prodeltaic wedge on the inner shelf \n\narea eastward of the river mouth, and the extensive mud belt that covers most of the middle \n\n\n\n18 \nChapter II. Study area \n\nshelf (Nelson et al., 1999; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2004; Lobo et al., 2004). The mid-shelf mud layer \n\nbegins inshore at ca. 40-50 m water depth and extends offshore to about 100 m water depth, \n\nwith the thickest part setting offset southeast of the river mouth and being well developed in-\n\nbetween the Guadiana and Guadalquivir river mouths (Nelson et al., 1999). All the margins of \n\nthe extensive mud deposits are interrupted by non-depositional areas, except for the southeast \n\nmargin (Nelson et al., 1999). \n\nThe development of the shelf depositional patterns throughout the late Pleistocene and \n\nHolocene has also been strongly influenced by the evolution of the Guadiana Estuary, and its \n\ninfilling process. Similar to the evolution of several other estuarine systems along the Gulf of \n\nCadiz Margin, both in the Spanish (Dabrio et al., 2000; Lario et al., 2002; Zazo et al., 2008) \n\nand in the Portuguese (Boski et al., 2008; Zazo et al., 2008; Schneider et al., 2010) coast \n\nsectors, the Guadiana Estuary infilling was closely related to the postglacial sea-level changes \n\n(Boski et al., 2002; Lobo et al., 2003). A first phase of accelerated infilling was identified \n\nbetween ca. 13,000 and 7,500-7,300 cal. years B.P. (Boski et al., 2002 and 2008), which \n\ntrapped mostly clay sediments inside the estuary until ca. 8,200-7,800 cal. years B.P. (Boski \n\net al., 2002). After this date, the central part of the estuary started to accumulate coarser \n\nmaterial that was being partly introduced by the continental shelf (Boski et al., 2002). The \n\nsecond phase of infilling developed at a much slower rate between ca. 7,500-7,300 and 5,700 \n\ncal. years B.P. and since then predominantly sandy sedimentation was initiated inside the \n\nestuary (Boski et al., 2002). Since the sea level has been nearly stabilized in the region, after \n\nca. 5,500 cal. years B.P., and with the estuarine accommodation space much reduced, \n\nprograding processes started to develop at the river mouth (Morales, 1997; Morales et al., \n\n2006). The estuary late Holocene geomorphological evolution included the construction of the \n\nsubmerged fluvial delta and the progradation of both the western and eastern margins, which \n\nstarted to retain an important part of the sediments being supplied by the river to the coast and \n\nshelf domains (Morales, 1997). \n\n \n\nII.4. Late Quaternary sea-level variation \n\nDuring the Quaternary, the main control on sea-level change was the exchange of mass \n\nbetween ice sheets and oceans, with ice sheet growth contributing to induce sea-level \n\nlowstands (e.g., Lambeck and Chappell, 2001). In the course of the Last Glacial Maximum \n\n(LGM) the eustatic sea level was around 125 +/- 5 m lower than the present day mean level \n\nand there is evidence for a non-uniform rise from the LGM to the end of the deglaciation. \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n \n\n19 \nChapter II. Study area \n \n\nUsing worldwide sea-level data from several sites, improved constraints on the global rate of \n\nrise have been attempted (Fleming et al., 1998), pointing to an initial slow rise that lasted \n\nfrom ca. 21 to 17 ka cal. B.P. with an average rate of ca. 6 m ka-1, followed by an increased \n\naverage rate of ca. 10 m ka-1 for the next 10,000 years until most of the decay of the large ice \n\nsheets was completed by 7 ka cal. B.P. \n\nFurthermore, it has been recognized that sea-level changes caused by glacial cycles have \n\nboth a global and a regional character (e.g., Fleming et al., 1998; Leorri et al., 2012), with the \n\nassociated meltwater discharges playing a significant role on rapid climatic change in western \n\nEurope (e.g., Fairbanks, 1989). It has been indeed demonstrated that the climate of the last \n\nglacial period was extremely unstable, with such variability that ranged from full glacial to \n\nnearly interglacial conditions, being first observed in the d18O record of Greenland ice cores \n\n(Dansgaard et al., 1993; Grootes et al., 1993). These cycles were named as Dansgaard\u2013\n\nOeschger (D\u2013O) Stadials and Interstadials, corresponding to cold and warm periods, \n\nrespectively (Bond et al., 1993) (Fig. II.6). Some of the D\u2013O Stadials were further related to \n\nepisodes of massive iceberg discharges into the North Atlantic Ocean (Bond et al., 1993), \n\nnamed Heinrich events (HE) and which have occurred six times along the last glacial period \n\n(60,000\u201315,000 calendar years B.P.) (Fig. II.6). Since then, during late Pleistocene, the \n\nNorthern Hemisphere was marked by a succession of major deglacial climatic events that \n\npreceded the Holocene period, namely the Oldest Dryas (ca. 18,000-14,700 cal. years B.P.; \n\nthe B\u00f8lling/Aller\u00f8d warm period (ca. 14,600 to 12,900 cal. years B.P.) and the Younger Dryas \n\ncold event (ca. 12,900 to 11,700 cal. years B.P.) (e.g., Alley and Clark, 1999) (Fig. II.6). \n\nWorldwide studies focusing on global and regional mean sea-level trends after the LGM, \n\nare also quite consensual in that the sea level was fast rising by the time of the Oldest Dryas, \n\ndriven by the huge meltwater release from decaying ice masses during the deglaciation (e.g., \n\nFleming et al., 1998; Dias et al., 2000; Hanebuth et al., 2000; Bard et al., 2010; Smith et al., \n\n2011). Accordingly, the sea-level rise curve established by Dias et al. (2000) (Fig. II.7a) for \n\nthe northern Portuguese Margin placed the mean sea level around 80-75 m below its present-\n\nday position at around 13,000 years B.P. (ca. 15,400 cal. years B.P.). During the \n\nB\u00f8lling/Aller\u00f8d period and the Younger Dryas, the sea level continued to rise and global sea-\n\nlevel reconstructions agree in that there was very fast acceleration in the rates of rise around \n\n14,000 cal. years B.P., due to an important meltwater pulse that released great volumes of \n\npolar ice into the ocean (Fairbanks, 1989; Fleming et al., 1998; Hanebuth et al., 2000; Bard et \n\nal., 2010). This pulse, which occurred during the B\u00f8lling/Aller\u00f8d period, is known as MWP \n\n1A, and although different studies attribute slightly different time-spans for its occurrence, in \n\n\n\n20 \nChapter II. Study area \n\ngeneral terms they all point to a sea-level rise of about 20 m in less than ca. 500 years \n\n(Fairbanks, 1989; Fleming et al., 1998; Hanebuth et al., 2000; Bard et al., 2010). \n\n \nFigure II.6 \u2013 Climate variability since the last glacial period: grey line marker is the atmospheric temperature record of the \nGreenland ice core GISP2 reconstructed from oxygen stable isotope data (Grootes et al., 1993), black line marker represents \na case-study of reconstructed surface temperatures of the Alboran Sea (Cacho et al., 2002). Dansgaard\u2013Oeschger\t\n \u00a0(D\u2013O)\t\n \u00a0\nInterstadial\t\n \u00a0cycles correspond to the numbers on top of the grey line marker (Dansgaard et al., 1993), Heinrich events are \nsignalized on the bottom (Bond et al., 1993), YD \u2013 Younger Dryas, B-O - B\u00f8lling/Aller\u00f8d, OD \u2013 Oldest Dryas (adapted from \nCacho et al., 2002). \n\n \n\nAccording to the same studies, although with great regional and latitudinal variability, the \n\nsea-level rise decelerated but in general continued to rise after the MWP 1A, reaching around \n\n60-55 m below present until ca. 12,000 cal. years B.P. In the curve established by Dias et al. \n\n(2000), the sea level on the northern Portuguese Margin was reconstructed as being already at \n\nca. 45-40 m below present around 12,000 years B.P. (ca. 14,000 cal. years B.P.) (Fig. II.7a). It \n\nwas followed by a phase of sea-level rise deceleration, and in some mid-latitude areas even a \n\nslight sea-level drop (e.g., Dias et al., 2000), associated with the onset of the colder Younger \n\nDryas (YD) that is believed to have slowed down the deglacial melting of the ice sheets \n\n(Fairbanks, 1989; Fleming et al., 1998; Hanebuth et al., 2000; Bard et al., 2010). This process \n\nof deceleration in the rate of rise during the YD has been further detected in the records of the \n\nSE Gulf of Cadiz margin (Rodero et al., 1999) and of the Guadiana Estuary (Delgado et al., \n\n2012) (Fig. II.7b). In the transition to the Holocene period there was another noticeable \n\nacceleration in the global rise of sea level due to a second major meltwater pulse (MWP 1B) \n\nthat affected the ice caps, linked with the transition from the colder YD to the warmer early \n\nHolocene (e.g., Fleming, 1989; Bard et al., 2010). The sea level is thought to have rapidly \n\nreached ca. 30 m below present mean level around the beginning of the Holocene in many \n\nregions (Fleming, 1989; Hanebuth et al., 2000; Bard et al., 2010), and the curves established \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n \n\n21 \nChapter II. Study area \n \n\nfor several locations throughout the Iberian Margin (Dias et al., 2000; Lario et al., 2002; Vis \n\net al., 2008; Delgado et al., 2012) and for the Bay of Biscay (Leorri et al., 2012) are likewise \n\nin close agreement with such scenario (Fig. II.7). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nFigure II.7 \u2013 Sea-level curves for the Eastern North Atlantic during the late \nPleistocene and Holocene periods (MSL \u2013 Mean Sea Level). The model curves \ncorrespond to data from: a) northern Portuguese Margin (Dias et al., 2000); b) \nsouthern Spanish estuaries (Lario et al., 2002), Algarve beach coast (Teixeira et \nal., 2005), Tagus River valley (Vis et al., 2008), Guadiana Estuary (Delgado et \nal., 2012), and southern Bay of Biscay (Leorri et al., 2012). \n\n \n\nThe sea-level reconstructions for the western European margin point to persistent sea-level \n\nrise throughout early- to mid-Holocene times (e.g., Hijma and Cohen, 2010), including those \n\nconducted in different areas along the Iberian Margin (Dias et al., 2000; Lario et al., 2002; \n\nTeixeira et al., 2005; Moura et al., 2007; Zazo et al., 2008; Vis et al., 2008; Delgado et al., \n\n2012) and in the Bay of Biscay (Leorri et al., 2012) (Fig. II.7). The first phase was \n\ncharacterized by a fast rate of rise of ca. 7-8.5 mm yr-1 (700-850 cm/ka) that lasted from the \n\nbeginning of the Holocene until ca. 7,500-7,000 cal. years B.P. It was followed by a \n\ndeceleration in the pace of marine transgression, which progressed at ca. 3 mm yr-1 (300 \n\ncm/ka) until around 5,500 cal. years B.P., when it reached its near stabilization. This is in \n\naccordance with the data obtained by other authors, who also pointed to the sea level reaching \n\nclose to its present-day position at around 6,000-5,500 cal. years B.P. (Dabrio et al., 2000; \n\nDias et al., 2000; Long, 2001; Lario et al., 2002; Moura et al., 2007; Zazo et al., 2008; Leorri \n\net al., 2012) (Fig. II.7). \n\nThe most recent data concerning the infilling of the Guadiana Estuary indicated that since \n\nca. 7,500 cal. years B.P. the sea level has continued to oscillate, slowly rising at a rate of ca. \n\n0.9-1.8 mm yr-1 (9-18 cm/ka) (Boski et al., 2008; Delgado et al., 2012) (Fig. II.7b). \n\n\n\n22 \nChapter II. Study area \n\nII.5. Holocene climate control and the recent anthropogenic impact \n\nIt has long been recognized that the Holocene was a time of important climate oscillations, \n\nand abrupt cyclic-climatic changes have been identified in particular for the North Atlantic \n\nduring this period (e.g., Bond et al., 1997; Wanner et al., 2008). \n\nHolocene climate variability and instability is to a large extent driven by centennial- and \n\nmillennial-scale fluctuations in the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation (e.g., Chapman \n\nand Shackleton, 2000), and seems to have been characterized by diverse climatic responses at \n\ndifferent latitudes of the North Atlantic region (e.g., Ruddiman and McIntyre, 1981; M\u00f6rner, \n\n1993; deMenocal et al., 2000; Magny et al., 2003). \n\nSeveral records from across the Mediterranean and the Iberian Peninsula are consensual in \n\nthat the early- to mid-Holocene was a period characterized by moisture conditions, occurring \n\nwithin the context of a generalized warmer and wetter climate designated as the Holocene \n\nThermal Maximum (e.g., Wanner et al., 2011; D\u00e9sprat et al., 2003; Naughton et al., 2007a; \n\nFletcher and S\u00e1nchez Go\u00f1i, 2008; Kaal et al., 2011; Giraudi et al., 2012). Particularly in the \n\nsouthern part of Iberia, increased precipitation records and an optimum of forest development \n\nhave been identified by several authors between the beginning of the Holocene and ca. 5,500-\n\n4,500 cal. years B.P. (e.g., Dorado Vali\u00f1o et al., 2002; Zazo et al., 2008; Anderson et al., \n\n2011), including in the Guadiana Lower Valley, where the pollen record revealed an \n\nexceptional expansion of the forest cover until ca. 5,000 cal. years B.P. (Fletcher et al., 2007). \n\nAn important dry and cold event seems however to have occurred within this time-interval at \n\nca. 8,000 cal. years B.P. (Fletcher et al., 2007), which was also detected in other areas of the \n\nMediterranean Basin and Iberia (e.g., Cacho et al., 2002; Dorado Vali\u00f1o et al., 2002; Magny \n\net al., 2003; Eynaud et al., 2009; Giraudi et al., 2012) and probably can be correlated with the \n\nwidely known 8.2 ka cal. B.P. cooling event (e.g., Bond et al., 1993; Barber et al., 1999). It \n\nwas much smaller and brief than the previous glacial swings, and sedimentological and \n\nglaciological research suggest that it was caused by a significant freshwater input into the \n\nNorth Atlantic (e.g., Bard, 2002). \n\nFrom mid- to late-Holocene onwards, a generalized climate change seems to have been set \n\nat around 5,500-4,500 cal. years B.P. mainly driven by orbital forcing that caused a shift in \n\ninsolation and the installation of the present atmosphere circulation in the northern \n\nhemisphere (Jalut et al., 2009), with most studies recognizing the progressive widespread of \n\ndrier conditions (e.g., Fletcher and S\u00e1nchez Go\u00f1i, 2008; Morell\u00f3n et al., 2008; Kaal et al., \n\n2011; Giraudi et al., 2012). Along the Mediterranean Basin, the climate change that began at \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n \n\n23 \nChapter II. Study area \n \n\nthis date resulted in changes in the seasonal pattern of precipitation and several arid phases \n\nwere identified as a regional response to global climatic oscillations (Jalut et al., 2000). In the \n\nwestern Mediterranean area, including southern Iberia, such trend also forced the \n\nestablishment of an arid, Mediterranean-like, climate (e.g., Dorado Vali\u00f1o et al., 2002; \n\nCarri\u00f3n et al., 2004; Carri\u00f3n et al., 2007; Zazo et al., 2008; Jalut et al., 2009; Gil-Romera et \n\nal., 2010). The pollen-based record for the Guadiana Lower Valley further agrees with this \n\nscenario, with a generally drier climate being detected in the region after ca. 5,000 cal. years \n\nB.P. (Fletcher et al., 2007). However, within this general scenario of enhanced dryness for the \n\nmid- to late-Holocene period, several decadal- to centennial-scale climate oscillations with a \n\nmore regional extent also seem to have occurred and events of enhanced humidity were \n\ndetected throughout Europe and the Mediterranean (e.g., Carri\u00f3n et al., 2001; Faust et al., \n\n2004; Mayewski et al., 2004; Gonz\u00e1lez-\u00c1lvarez et al., 2005; Bern\u00e1rdez et al., 2008; Casana, \n\n2008; Marquer et al., 2008; Alt-Epping et al., 2009; B\u00fcngten, 2011). One of the most \n\nprominent of these events detected in the Iberian Peninsula took place around 2,600-1,600 cal. \n\nyears B.P. as the most humid phase of the last 4,000 years in southern Spain, roughly \n\ncoinciding with the Roman occupation of the Peninsula, thus being denominated as the \n\nIberian-Roman Humid Period (Mart\u00edn-Puertas et al., 2009). \n\nFurthermore, at a sub-orbital timescale, the influence of North Atlantic climatic variability \n\nand of its main synoptic mode of atmosphere circulation, the NAO, is widely recognized and \n\nhas been linked by many authors to climate and environmental changes inferred during the \n\nmain climatic events that marked the late Holocene (e.g., Abrantes et al., 2005; Gil et al., \n\n2006; Wanner et al., 2008; Trouet et al., 2009; Moreno et al., 2012), including the more \n\nrecent Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age (e.g., Hughes, 1994; Mann, 1999; Mann \n\nand Jones, 2003). Instrumental data concerning the winter NAO-index variability only go \n\nfurther back until the mid-19th century, but recent studies have been making an effort to \n\nreconstruct the NAO patterns as far as the 16th-17th centuries (Cook et al., 2002; Luterbacher \n\net al., 2002) and even spanning for the last ca. 1,000 years (Bard et al., 2007; Trouet et al., \n\n2009; Trouet et al., 2012), highlighting its influence over the European climate at \n\nmultidecadal and centennial time-scales. In southern Iberia, coastal records of climatic \n\noscillations during the last ca. millennia detected a decadal periodicity that seemed related to \n\nfluctuations of the NAO index (Zazo et al., 2008), whereas in the specific case of the \n\nGuadiana Valley climatic oscillations that were detected at a submillennial-scale throughout \n\nthe Holocene have also been associated with variations in the North Atlantic ocean-\n\natmosphere system and with the NAO index (Fletcher et al., 2007). \n\n\n\n24 \nChapter II. Study area \n\nSuperimposed on the Holocene climate change, the more recent impact of anthropogenic \n\ndevelopment and land-use activities has been widely investigated throughout European \n\nterritories, and a positive correlation seems clear between both forcing mechanisms in the \n\nshape and transformation of the natural systems (e.g., Berglund, 2003; B\u00fcngten, 2011). \n\nIn southern Iberia, the influence of human activity has been detected in some areas as far \n\nback as ca. 5,500 cal. years B.P. (e.g., Carri\u00f3n and Dupr\u00e9, 1997), and studies focusing on the \n\nmineral extraction of the Iberian Pyrite Belt dated it from around the third millennium B.C. \n\n(Nocete et al., 2005), which is consistent with that date. In the Guadiana Valley, the first signs \n\nof human intervention in the vegetation cover (Fletcher et al., 2007) and of mining \n\nexploitation (Delgado et al., 2012) also date back to around 4,500-4,000 cal. years B.P. Yet, \n\nthe investigations carried out specifically in the Guadiana Basin influence area also seem to \n\nagree in that more significant transformations occurred later, with the emergence of a semi-\n\nforested cultural landscape and the intensification of mining activities only after ca. 3,300 cal. \n\nyears B.P. (Fletcher et al., 2007; Delgado et al., 2012). This matches quite well with the \n\nbeginning of the Iberian Period (3,200 cal. years B.P.) that was identified in the neighboring \n\nregion of Sierra Baza (southern Spain) as a time of advance in agriculture and irrigation, with \n\nthe widespread cultivation of vines and of fig and almond trees (Carri\u00f3n et al., 2007). \n\nHowever, the first major significant changes to the landscape were brought by the Roman \n\nRule of Iberia that followed (ca. 200 years B.C. to 500 years A.D. \u2013 ca. 2,200 to 1,450 cal. \n\nyears B.P.), with historical and archaeological sources clearly denouncing an intensification \n\nof human impact on woodland resources during this period, mainly for agricultural, domestic \n\nuse and mining purposes (e.g., Alarc\u00e3o, 1987; Alarc\u00e3o, 1990; Fabi\u00e3o, 1993). The more recent \n\npollen and multiproxy investigations carried out in the Guadiana area are in agreement with \n\nsuch scenario (Fletcher et al., 2007; Delgado et al., 2012), as are several studies developed in \n\nother areas of southern Iberia that unravelled the onset of strong human intervention in the \n\nvegetation cover only after ca. 2,000 cal. years B.P. (e.g., Zazo et al., 2008; Gil-Romera et al., \n\n2010). Moreover, the coupling of Roman development with a contemporaneous climate shift \n\ntowards more humidity has been pointed out as the main mechanism for enhanced impacts on \n\nthe landscape throughout the Mediterranean (Casana, 2008; Zielhofer et al., 2002; Faust et al., \n\n2004) and in other areas of Iberia (D\u00e9sprat et al., 2003; Dinis et al., 2006; Mighall et al., \n\n2006; Carri\u00f3n et al., 2010b), as the human interventions created the pre-conditions for soil \n\nerosion but it only occurred when unusually high precipitation levels were originated.  \n\nThe Medieval Islamic Rule of Iberia, after the 8th century A.D. (ca. 1,200 cal. years B.P.), \n\nconstituted the second major pulse of human intervention in the study area. It was responsible \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n \n\n25 \nChapter II. Study area \n \n\nfor further impacts on the southern regions of Iberia, including along the Guadiana Basin, \n\ninitiating an unprecedent population growth and an extraordinary maximization of the natural \n\nresources of the region (e.g., Devy-Vareta, 1985; Ribeiro, 1987; Oliveira Marques, 1993; \n\nChester and James, 1999, Boone and Worman, 2007), which eventually led to the occurrence \n\nof even more severe erosional processes (Chester and James, 1999; Boone and Worman, \n\n2007; Chester, 2012).  \n\nAlthough the human-induced transformations along the Guadiana Basin that were \n\nirreversibly put in motion during the Roman and Islamic times, persisted to some extent \n\nthroughout the Middle Ages and beyond (e.g., Ribeiro, 1987; Mattoso, 1995; Chester and \n\nJames, 1999), the human impact in the region only witnessed another significant increase for \n\nthe last ca. 200-150 years. New agricultural developments and, particularly, the reactivation \n\nand expansion of several important mines along the Iberian Pyrite Belt during the 19th century \n\nA.D., contributed to the enhancement of the long-term anthropogenic impacts in the region \n\n(e.g., Serr\u00e3o, 1986; Corredeira et al., 2008; Chester, 2012; Delgado et al., 2012). As a \n\nconsequence, soil erosion increased along the watersheds and there was an increment in the \n\nsediment supply from the river basin onto the coast and shelf domains (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2001; \n\nDias et al., 2004; Gonz\u00e1lez and Dias, 2006). \n\n \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nChapter III \n \n \n \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n\n\n\n28 \nChapter III.

Sampling \n\nIn the laboratory, the cores were opened and split lengthwise into two halves. One half was \n\npreserved for archive and frozen, whereas the second half was set for analysis and sampled \n\nimmediately. \n\nSampling of the three cores from the mud body followed identical procedures. Core 1 was \n\nsampled sequentially in intervals of 1 cm-thick slices from the top (0 cm) down to 20 cm, and \n\nof 2 cm-thick slices from this level to the base of the sequence. Core 6 was sampled at the top \n\nin a 2 cm-thick slice (0-2 cm), and sequentially from there to level 40 cm in 1 cm-thick slices, \n\nand in 2 cm-thick slices between that level and the base. Core 14 was sampled sequentially in \n\n1 cm-thick slices from the top (0 cm) down to 50 cm, and from this level to 239 cm in 2 cm \n\nslices, with the base level sampled in a 2.5 cm-thick slice (239-241.5 cm). \n\nSampling of the inner shelf core was also performed sequentially but with a more irregular \n\ngrid, adjustable to the variations in grain-size and sediment composition along-core. \n\n\n\n30 \nChapter III. Materials and methods \n\nVibrocore 20 was sampled at the top in a 2 cm-thick slice (0-2 cm), as well as for core-depth \n\nintervals 3-19 cm, 22-36 cm, 40-94 cm, 97-99 cm, 104-142 cm, 205-222 cm and 316-318 cm. \n\nSampling consisted on 1 cm-thick slices for core-depth intervals 2-3 cm and 36-40 cm; on 1.5 \n\ncm-thick slice between 102.5 cm and 104 cm; and on 3 cm-thick slices for core-depth \n\nintervals 19-22 cm, 94-97 cm, 99-102 cm, 142-205 cm, 222-316 cm, and from level 318 cm \n\ndown to the base of the core (342 cm). \n\nEach level of cores 1, 6 and 14 was sub-sampled for grain-size, geochemical and benthic \n\nforaminiferal analyses. In core 20, the same was done for most of the sequence, except in the \n\nbasal section (222-342 cm), where levels were sub-sampled only for grain-size and benthic \n\nforaminiferal analyses due to the coarser nature of sediments that disabled future geochemical \n\nanalyses. \n\n \n\nIII.2. Dating \n\nIII.2.1. AMS radiocarbon analyses \n\nSample levels selected for dating analysis were first chosen based on the presence of \n\nsignificant changes observed along the vibrocores in the dominant type of sediments, which \n\nhad already been identified through the grain-size analyses. Whenever possible, \n\ncomplementary datings were further obtained to help validate the previous set and to establish \n\na higher resolution for the temporal framework of the sequences. \n\nA total of 15 radiocarbon analyses were processed for the four vibrocores. Accelerated \n\nmass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon (14C) dating was performed at Beta Analytic Inc. \n\n(U.S.A.), using 20 to 40 mg of mixed benthic foraminiferal tests for levels of the mud body \n\nvibrocores, and a minimum of 30 mg of mollusc shells for levels of the inner shelf vibrocore. \n\nAlmost all samples corresponded to 2 cm-thick intervals, except for level 132-136 cm of core \n\n14, in which the low abundance of foraminiferal tests compelled the use of 4 cm, and levels \n\n151-154 cm and 286-289 cm of core 20 that had been previously sampled for grain-size at 3 \n\ncm-thick slices. \n\nSamples of the mud body vibrocores were first washed with tap water through a 63-\u00b5m \n\nsieve. The retained sediment was dried in an oven at ca. 50 \u00baC and then analysed under the \n\nbinocular microscope for collection of the benthic foraminiferal tests, with special attention \n\nfor avoiding re-worked tests that could disturb the dating results. As for the inner shelf \n\nsamples, the mollusc shells were chosen from the coarse fraction (-6 ? to 4 ? / 64 mm to \n\n0.063 mm) according to their preservation state, in order to avoid remobilized material. They \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n \n\n31 \nChapter III. Materials and methods \n\nwere furthermore identified, based on specialized bibliography (Fischer et al., 1987; Macedo, \n\n1999), to assure the individuals matched species with an ecological distribution compatible \n\nwith the inner shelf environment, from where vibrocore 20 was collected. \n\nThe obtained radiocarbon ages were calibrated with programme CALIB 5.1 (Stuiver et al., \n\n2005), using the MARINE04 curve and the global ocean reservoir correction of ca. 400 years \n\n(Stuiver and Reimer, 1993). Local reservoir effect (delta R) was furthermore applied \n\naccording to Soares and Martins (2010), specifically a correction of 0\u00b1100 years for dates \n\nolder than 2,000 radiocarbon years and of -135\u00b120 years for dates younger than that age. \n\nConventional radiocarbon ages will be reported as years \u2018before present\u2019 (B.P., \u2018present\u2019 = \n\n1,950 A.D.). Calendar calibrated ages will be reported as years \u2018before Christ\u2019 and \u2018Anno \n\nDomini\u2019 (B.C./A.D.) and calibrated ages as years \u2018before present\u2019 (B.P.). \n\n \n\nIII.2.2. Age models and sedimentation rates  \n\nThe age models were created for all vibrocores based on 14C calibrated (2 sigma) ages, \n\ncore depth (cm) and sedimentation rates (cm per thousand of years). \n\nThe age-depth model adopted in this study was based on a linear interpolation, which \n\nassumes a stable sediment accumulation between the dated levels. The calibrated ages (cal. \n\nyears B.P.) were plotted against core depths (cm) and the gradients of the lines connecting \n\neach adjacent pair of points corresponded to an estimate of the sedimentation rates. In the \n\nlinear interpolation approach, interpolated ages are calculated for intermediate depths between \n\neach of the adjacent pair of points. The changes that are thus identified in the sedimentation \n\nrates along-core make the interpolation model the most appropriate fit to our data (Telford et \n\nal., 2004). Moreover, although linear interpolation remains as a basic approach to derive an \n\nage-depth model, as it does not account for errors on the calibrated ages nor makes \n\ncorrections for sediment compaction, it has been proven to provide good estimates for both \n\nages and gradients, which are usually in agreement with results produced by more complex \n\nmodels (Blaaw and Heegaard, 2012). \n\nSedimentation rates (cm/ka cal. B.P.) that were obtained for all the shelf sedimentary \n\nsequences translate the velocity of sediment build-up (van Andel et al., 1975). Zero validation \n\nwas applied to the age model created for each sediment core. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n32 \nChapter III. Materials and methods \n\nIII.3. Sedimentology \n\nIII.3.1. Grain-size \n\nDowncore grain-size analyses were carried out sequentially in all four vibrocores using 2 \n\ncm-thick sample slices, or 3\u20134 cm slices for coarser sediments. Firstly, samples were treated \n\nwith hydrogen peroxide to eliminate organic matter. Coarse (sand and gravel) and fine (silt \n\nand clay) grained sediments were then separated by wet sieving using a 63-\u00b5m sieve. The \n\ngrain-size distribution (at phi scale intervals, ?) of the coarse fractions was determined by dry \n\nsieving, and of the fine fractions by the pipette method. In addition, the dominant textural \n\nclasses (gravel, sand, silt, and clay; silt and clay corresponding to \u2018mud\u2019 as defined by the \n\nclassification of Folk, 1954) were determined in each case. \n\n \n\nIII.3.2. Determination of sand fraction compounds \n\nFor determination of the sand (\u20131 ? to 4 ? / 2 mm to 0.063 mm) compounds, a sampling \n\ngrid of regular 10 cm intervals was established along-core in each one of the sedimentary \n\nsequences. A total of 39 samples were analysed for vibrocore 1, of 31 samples for vibrocore \n\n6, of 25 samples for vibrocore 14 and of 36 samples for vibrocore 20. \n\nThe terrigenous and biogenic compounds were identified and quantified under a binocular \n\nmicroscope by counting 100 grains in each sand phi class (-1 to 0 ?, 0 to 1 ?, 1 to 2 ? , 2 to 3 \n\n? and 3 to 4 ?), giving a total of 500 grains for each sample. Within the terrigenous \n\ncompounds, quartz, mica, charcoal, carbonate lithoclasts, schist/greywackes, sandstones, \n\naggregates (poly-mineralic grains) and other terrigenous grains (mono-mineralic grains, such \n\nas feldspars and heavy minerals) were distinguished. The biogenic compounds were divided \n\ninto molluscs, benthic foraminifera, planktonic foraminifera, ostracods and other bioclasts \n\n(such as fragments of echinoderms and corals). The results were statistically analysed and the \n\nweighted mean for all compounds was calculated after Sarnthein (1971), corresponding to the \n\ntotal sum of grains in each sand \u2018phi\u2019 class multiplied by their weight and divided by the total \n\nweight of the sand fraction. \n\nThe same procedure was adopted for the gravel fraction of vibrocore 20, whenever it was \n\nfound to be statistically representative (?100 grains in each sample) in more than one half of \n\nthe analysed samples. \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n \n\n33 \nChapter III. Materials and methods \n\nIn order to maintain regional consistency, the identification scheme followed the \n\nclassification established by Dias (1987) for the superficial sediments of the northern \n\nPortuguese continental shelf. \n\n \n\nIII.3.3. Quartz shape and surface texture \n\nIn the same samples that had been analysed for identification of the sand compounds, 100 \n\nquartz grains were additionally selected from each 1\u20132 ? size fraction for surface texture and \n\nshape analyses. This investigation was also conducted under the binocular microscope, and \n\nthe results were statistically evaluated with the calculation of the relative abundances for all \n\nvariables that integrated the analysis. \n\nGrains were classified according to the morphoscopic groups defined in Schneider and \n\nCailleux (1959): not worn (\u2018non-us\u00e9s\u2019, NU, indicative of weak transport), rounded-frosted \n\n(\u2018rond-mats\u2019, RM, indicative of aeolian transport), and smooth-shining (\u2018emouss\u00e9s-luisants\u2019, \n\nEL, indicative of transport in water). A fourth group was proposed for grains evidencing a \n\nmixed EL/RM signature, suggestive of initial water and subsequent aeolian transport. \n\nShape analyses were based on the roundness and sphericity of grains, indicators for erosion \n\nand transport (Powers 1953). The degree of roundness was classified from very angular (VA), \n\nangular (A), and subangular (SA) - indicative of weak transport - to subrounded (SR), \n\nrounded (R), and well rounded (WR), indicative of more vigorous transport. The degree of \n\nsphericity was classified as either high or low, indicative of both the transport intensity and \n\nthe dominant transport mechanism that could correspond to a multidirectional (e.g., tides, \n\nwaves, wind) or to a unidirectional (e.g., river currents) flow, respectively. \n\n \n\nIII.4. Benthic foraminifera \n\nIII.4.1. Sample preparation  \n\nThe study of benthic foraminifera in the mud body deposits followed a 10 cm interval \n\nsampling grid for each core, and the core-base samples were considered for analysis. A total \n\nof 31 samples were analysed in vibrocore 1, of 30 samples in vibrocore 6, and of 25 samples \n\nin vibrocore 14. \n\nAll selected samples were dried in the oven at ca. 50 \u00baC and weighted, in order to obtain \n\nthe weight (g) of the total sediment. Dry samples were then washed through the 2,000-\u00b5m and \n\n63-\u00b5m sieves under tap water, to separate the gravel and sand sediments, and to remove the \n\n\n\n34 \nChapter III. Materials and methods \n\nfine material, respectively. The sieves went through Methylene Blue dye in-between the wash \n\nof each sample, to avoid their contamination with previously washed material. Both gravel \n\nand sand fractions were dried in the oven (ca. 50 \u00baC) and weighted, to attain the weight (g) of \n\nthe total coarse-fraction of the dry sediment samples. \n\n \n\nIII.4.2. Counting and identification \n\nThe > 63-\u00b5m material was divided into aliquots with the help of an Otto micro-splitter, the \n\nsize of the split for each sample being determined according to the number of expected \n\nindividuals. The goal was to obtain at least 300 foraminiferal tests for identification in each \n\nsample, the number most widely considered as minimum necessary when a more detailed \n\napproach on the overall distribution of species is intended for the assemblages. Although for \n\ndead/fossil assemblages (time-averaged accumulations), the counting of 100 individuals may \n\nsuffice to record all the important species, it often does not allow to distinguish more specific \n\nfeatures such as which of the main species is dominant (Fatela and Taborda, 2002; Murray, \n\n2006). \n\nThe study of the benthic foraminiferal microfaunas was carried out under a binocular \n\nmicroscope MEIJI Techno EMZ3, with a maximum magnification of up to 140x. In each \n\naliquot, all well-preserved benthic foraminiferal tests were picked from a tray, mounted on \n\nlightly glued cardboard slides, and the individuals counted and identified up to the species, \n\nwhenever possible. The generic classification of benthic foraminifera followed the taxonomy \n\nproposed by Loeblich and Tappan (1987) for the Genera level, except Textularia, \n\nQuinqueloculina and Discorbis for which the original species names found in the Ellis and \n\nMessina Catalogue of Foraminifera (1942-2009) were kept. Species identification was \n\nfurthermore determined on basis of specialized bibliography, namely the Ellis and Messina \n\ncatalogue (1942-2009), Murray (1971), Colom (1974), Boltovskoy et al. (1980), Jones \n\n(1994), Levy et al. (1995), Debenay et al. (2001), Murray (2003), Martins and Gomes (2004), \n\nMilker and Schmiedl (2012), among others. \n\nRelative abundances (%) of all the identified species were calculated in all samples of the \n\nthree cores. Taking into consideration counts of ca. 300 individuals, and although only \n\nabundances of &lt;1% are found to be close to confidence limits and cease to be significant \n\n(Buzas, 1990), the abundance variations of occurrences up to 5% are generally not considered \n\nmeaningful (Murray, 2006). Hence, species distribution and assemblages of main benthic \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n \n\n35 \nChapter III. Materials and methods \n\nforaminiferal species were established for each sedimentary sequence considering only \n\nspecies with more than 5% in at least one sample of the core. \n\nAll the main benthic foraminiferal species, and several other, were documented by means \n\nof scanning electron microscope (SEM) photographs, which were obtained with a JEOL, \n\nJMS-5200 LV microscope at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon. \n\n \n\nIII.4.3. Population density and diversity measures \n\nThe population density (or faunistical density, FD) was calculated for each sample, \n\ncorresponding to the number of benthic foraminifera per gram of dry sediment (n\u00ba/g of dry \n\nsediment). The number of species, designated by Species Richness (S), was also determined \n\nfor each sample. The population diversity measures of Shannon-Wiener Index (Hs) and \n\nEvenness (J) were calculated using the PAST (PAlaentological Statistics, ver. 1.81) software \n\n(Hammer et al., 2008), with species richness (Si) and the total number of individuals (ni) of \n\neach sample (i) as data entries. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index (values ranging from 0 to \n\ninfinite) uses the proportion p of species x (px) and the ln(px), being p=100%. This implies \n\nthat the contribution of each species x to the index value Hs(i) depends on its proportion \n\nwithin the sample i, and as a consequence rare species make little contribution. Evenness \n\n(values ranging from 0 to 1) is used to describe how individuals are distributed amongst \n\nspecies in each sample, meaning that the greater the dominance of one species, the lower will \n\nbe the value of J. \n\n \n\nIII.4.4. Cluster analysis (multivariate statistics) \n\nCluster analysis was applied to the assemblages of main foraminiferal species (species with \n\n> 5% in at least one sample of each core), determined for the mud body sequences. \n\nCluster analysis stands as one of the most widely used techniques of multivariate statistics \n\nin foraminiferal studies, segregating variables (such as samples and species) into naturally \n\noccurring groups and quantifying the between-group relationships (Sen Gupta, 1999). A \n\ncluster corresponds to a group of objects of the considered variable that are sufficiently \n\nsimilar to be recognized as members of the same group, resulting from the analysis of the \n\nsimilarities/dissimilarities among those objects (Blaaw and Heegaard, 2012). The most \n\nfrequently used clustering methods are both hierarchical and agglomerative, meaning they \n\nstart with all objects in separate groups and proceed iteratively to cluster by merging pairs of \n\ngroups from previous iterations, until all objects are grouped into a single cluster (Sen Gupta, \n\n\n\n36 \nChapter III. Materials and methods \n\n1999). The advantage of hierarchical clustering is that it allows for the local determination of \n\ngroup boundaries along a sedimentary sequence, evidencing the relationships among groups, \n\nwhilst agglomerative clustering is also more satisfactory for zonation because the clusters are \n\nbuilt up locally (Grimm, 1987). \n\nCluster analysis of the assemblages defined in each vibrocore was performed with the \n\nPAST software (ver. 1.81; Hammer et al., 2008) for R-Mode clustering (grouping of \n\nforaminiferal species) and the TILIA software (ver. 2.0.2; Grimm, 2004) for Q-Mode \n\nclustering (grouping of samples). \n\nFor R-Mode clustering, analyses were stratigraphically unconstrained, as the grouping of \n\nspecies does not intend to join them on basis of their stratigraphic relationships. The PAST \n\nsoftware allowed the performance of several algorithms and therefore a number of analyses \n\nwere run with the foraminiferal data of the three vibrocores, as it is advisable to discard or \n\ndistrust any results that are fundamentally different from the others (Sen Gupta, 1999). The \n\nalgorithms tested were Ward\u2019s Method, also known as the \u2018incremental sum of squares\u2019 \n\nmethod, and UPGMA (Unweighted Pair-Group Method using Arithmetic averages) using as \n\nmeasure indices of goodness-to-fit either the \u2018Gower Distance\u2019 (dissimilarity measure) or the \n\n\u2018Matrix Correlation\u2019 (similarity measure). Ward\u2019s Method operates on a dissimilarity matrix \n\nof Euclidian distances (0-infinity) and follows a zonation criterion that diminishes the total \n\nwithin-zone dispersion, which means the clusters are joined such that the increase in within-\n\ngroup variance is minimized. In the unconstrained analysis, the method searches for the \n\nminimum value between objects in the entire dissimilarity matrix at each stage of the \n\nclustering process (Grimm, 1987). The UPGMA method proceeds by step-wise condensation \n\nof the cophenetic similarity/dissimilarity matrix. Each step starts by the identification of the \n\nnext pair of objects that has the largest similarity or the smallest dissimilarity, followed by a \n\ncondensation of all the measures of resemblance involving that pair which calculates the \n\narithmetic means of the similarities/dissimilarities (Blaaw and Heegaard, 2012). Clusters are \n\ntherefore joined based on the average distance between all members of two groups. As for the \n\nUPGMA measure indices that compare the original data matrix with the cophenetic \n\nsimilarity/dissimilarity matrix, \u2018Matrix Correlation\u2019 is Pearson\u2019s linear correlation coefficient \n\nr (0-1) computed between the values in the two half-matrices of similarities, whilst the \n\n\u2018Gower Distance\u2019 is the sum of the squared differences between the original and the \n\ncophenetic values (Blaaw and Heegaard, 2012). Although one method is not necessarily better \n\nthan the other, attention should be paid to assure the best choice is made accordingly to the \n\nspecificities of the analysed data. Correlation coefficients, for example, may prove to be \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n \n\n37 \nChapter III. Materials and methods \n\nundesirable measures of similarity in high-diversity communities, because they are strongly \n\naffected by sample size (Krebs, 1989). Several studies based on the comparison of the various \n\nclustering techniques also seem to suggest that, in many cases, the Ward\u2019s Method may show \n\nsome superiority to UPGMA algorithms (Sen Gupta, 1999). A good approach to quantify the \n\nsuccess of a specific cluster analysis and compare the results given by different algorithms, is \n\nthe obtainment of the cophenetic correlation value. It compares the between-object similarity \n\nvalues in the original matrix with a similar test derived from the clustered results, in which \n\nvalues approaching 1 indicate less distortion of the original similarities by the clustering \n\nprocess and thus correspond to the most adequate algorithm (Sen Gupta, 1999). After \n\napplying the three different algorithms of R-Mode clustering to the mud body foraminiferal \n\nmicrofaunas, Ward\u2019s Method proved indeed to be the best-fit to the foraminiferal data of the \n\nvibrocores. Although its cophenetic correlation value was not the highest for any of the cores, \n\nit proved still to perform quite satisfactory with high mean values, always above 0.86. But \n\nmore importantly, the further comparison of the species assemblages suggested by its \n\ndendrograms and by those of the UPGMA indices with the natural distribution of the species \n\nabundances within each core, proved that the Ward\u2019s Method was the algorithm which \n\nreflected best the natural tendencies evidenced by the mud body microfaunas. \n\nFor Q-Mode clustering analysis, TILIA software uses the program CONISS that performs \n\nstratigraphically constrained clustering (clusters contain only stratigraphically adjacent \n\nsamples) based on Ward\u2019s Method, which has proven to perform very satisfactorily on \n\nfrequency data of fossil stratigraphic data (Grimm, 1987). For frequency data (e.g., pollen \n\ndata, foraminifera), transformation before calculation of the matrix of squared Euclidian \n\ndistances, is usually advised (Grimm, 1987). This is particularly recommended when a few \n\nspecies are excessively common or rare in the samples and these extreme values distort the \n\noverall picture (Krebs, 1989), as was the case of the mud body foraminiferal assemblages. \n\nThe square-root transformation, which produces the chord distance of Edwards and Cavalli-\n\nSforza and up-weights rare variables relative to abundant ones, has been the best attested for \n\nthis type of data (Grimm, 1987) and was thus applied to our foraminiferal data. \n\nThe cluster analyses produce results under the form of dendrograms, which illustrate the \n\nhierarchical relationships of the clusters defined by the analysis. The recognition of \n\nsignificant clusters within a dendrogram is largely a subjective process, with clusters being \n\ngraphically designated by simply constructing a \u2018phenon\u2019 line that marks a level of \n\nsimilarity/dissimilarity at which the clusters are presumed to represent meaningful \n\naggregations (Sen Gupta, 1999). A good strategy is to delimit zones using a straight cut across \n\n\n\n38 \nChapter III. Materials and methods \n\nthe dendrogram and then, according with the specific distribution of the clusters for each set \n\nof data and if it requires so, to divide certain zones further into sub-zones that have \n\ninterpretive value (Hedberg, 1976). In the specific case of the CONISS program (TILIA \n\nsoftware) that was used, various criteria to define the heights of nodes connecting clusters in \n\ndendrograms for the \u2018incremental sum of squares\u2019 (Ward\u2019s) method, are available. The \u2018total \n\nwithin-cluster dispersion\u2019 was the criterion chosen for our foraminiferal data, as it usually \n\ngenerates zones similar to those the researcher would select by inspection, with just a straight \n\ncut across the dendrogram, therefore providing the most useful and realistic information \n\n(Grimm, 1987). \n\n\n\n39 \nC\n\nhapter IV.

Fine sediments (silt and clay) stand as \u2018mud\u2019 whenever deposits were a mixture of \ngravel, sand and fines, or separately as \u2018silt\u2019 and \u2018clay\u2019 when deposits were composed only by sand and fines. \u2018Shells\u2019 \nrepresent mixed and mainly broken bioclastic content, with different symbol sizes attesting for the dimensional variability of \nthe bioclasts found within the sediment layers. \n\n \n\nFrom the base of the sequence until close to core level 241 cm, sediments corresponded to \n\ncoarse sands with very abundant small to large bioclastic remains (mostly molluscs), and \n\nunbroken bivalve shells. Two depositional intervals (289-277 cm and 259-241 cm) within this \n\ncore section were marked by enhanced coarse sedimentation, which was due to the \n\nparticularly high accumulation of big-sized bivalve shells. Aggregates (rock fragments) were \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n41 \nChapter IV. Inner shelf environment \n\nalso present in this section of the core, tending to become smaller towards its upper limit, \n\ntogether with some mudclasts that appeared between levels 277 cm and 259 cm. \n\nA sharp boundary separated the base section of the upper one (comprised between levels \n\n241 cm and 143 cm), indicating an abrupt change in sedimentation that occurred between \n\nboth depositional phases. Deposition continued to be dominated by sands but these became \n\nmedium- to coarse-grained, and with a clear higher contribution of fine material (\u2018mud\u2019) \n\nthroughout the section. The bioclastic content became more diversified, with still significant \n\namounts of bioclastic remains of several dimensions but also more abundant unbroken bivalve \n\nshells and gastropods. Some mudclasts were detected between core levels 228 and 217 cm. A \n\nthin layer of ca. 10 cm of much coarser sands was identified at core depth 184-175 cm, \n\ncharacterized by a strong increase of the bioclastic content. \n\nThe transition to the upper section (from core depth 143 cm to 44 cm) was again marked \n\nby a rapid shift in sedimentation. Sediments became increasingly finer, with mainly fine-\n\ngrained sands dominating the record and accompanied by an important mud component that \n\nincreased as much as two-fold. The bioclastic content continued to be abundant and almost \n\nentirely dominated by broken mollusk shells. A very thin and well individualized mud layer \n\nwas identified between levels 116 cm and 112 cm, apparently setting the definitive \n\nestablishment of a fine-dominated deposition at the site of vibrocore 20 on the inner shelf. \n\nAround core depth 44 cm, a gradational boundary translated a more or less gradual \n\nvariation, with a depositional change towards even finer sediments. Predominantly silt and \n\nclay that were almost absent of visible bioclastic content, deposited at this site of the inner \n\nshelf until recent times (top of the sequence). This type of sedimentation was however \n\ninterrupted during a specific event, recorded in the sedimentary sequence (core depth 13-3 \n\ncm) as a layer of coarser deposits. It corresponded to a mixture of sand and silt, with many \n\nbioclastic remains, some unbroken shells of bivalves and high amounts of organic debris. This \n\norganic material was only further registered at the core-depth interval 39-26 cm. \n\n \n\nIV.1.2. Age model  \n\nThe age model for vibrocore 20 was constructed based on four AMS radiocarbon datings, \n\nobtained at selected depth levels along-core. All information concerning the dated levels, \n\nsample laboratory codes, radiocarbon and calibrated dating results, is summarized in Table \n\nIV.1. \n\n \n\n\n\n42 \nChapter IV.

At core level 286-289 \n\ncm, dating results provided an age of ca. 8,416 to 7,972 cal. years B.P. for the sediments, \n\ncorresponding to a coarser deposition (Fig. IV.2). An age of 2,036 and 1,514 cal. years B.P. \n\nwas obtained at level 215-217 cm, where a peak (ca. 20%) of silt and clay deposition occurred \n\n(Fig. IV.2). Finally, the youngest date obtained for the sequence corresponded to an age \n\nbetween 1,259 and 1,048 cal. years B.P. at level 151-154 cm, which sets the beginning of fine \n\nsedimentation episodes on the inner shelf (Fig. IV.2). \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure IV.2 \u2013 Depth (cm), grain-size and dated \nlevels along vibrocore 20.

Inner shelf environment \n\nSedimentation rates on the inner shelf location of vibrocore 20 showed a general increase \n\ntrend along time (Fig. IV.3). In early Holocene, during the period between ca. 9,200 and \n\n8,400-7,900 cal. years B.P., rates were about 54 cm/ka. For the period that lasted from ca. \n\n8,400-7,900 cal. years B.P. until ca. 2,000-1,500 cal. years B.P., the rates decreased and \n\nreached their lowest values on the inner shelf, of around 11 cm/ka. During the late Holocene, \n\nthe velocity of sediment build-up greatly increased. Sedimentation rates reached around 102 \n\ncm/ka during the period from ca. 2,000-1,500 until 1,260-1,050 cal. years B.P., and around \n\n132 cm/ka from this last date until recent times. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure IV.3 \u2013 Age model and sedimentation rates \n(cm/ka) of vibrocore 20. The error-bars in the control-\npoints of the age model curve represent the uncertainty \n(2?) of the calibrated dates (ka cal. B.P.). \n\n \n\nIn what concerns the lowermost ca. 20 cm of the vibrocore (from 318 to 342 cm core-\n\ndepth), in which no dating was possible to obtain, the same sedimentation rate that was \n\ncalculated for the oldest dated period of the sequence (between 9,025- 8,458 cal. years B.P. \n\nand 8,416 to 7,972 cal. years B.P.) was assumed for constructing the core age model. Based \n\non these calculations, an age of 9,178 cal. years B.P. was estimated for the base-level (339-\n\n342 cm) of the sequence. \n\n \n\nIV.1.3. Sediment characterization \n\nIV.1.3.1. Grain-size \n\nThe grain-size composition (sedimentary texture) of vibrocore 20 showed that coarser \n\nsediments (gravel and mostly sand) dominated this inner shelf location until ca. 1,000 cal. \n\nyears B.P., and from this age until present-day deposition became finer with enhanced content \n\nof silt and clay (Fig. IV.4a). Concomitantly, the mean grain-size of sediments was typical of \n\ncoarse to medium sands until the same date, and afterwards increased to values that \n\ncharacterize fine sands and fines (Fig. IV.4b). \n\n\n\n44 \nChapter IV. Inner shelf environment \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.4 \u2013 a) Sediment grain-size composition (%) \nand b) mean grain-size (phi - ?), along vibrocore 20. \n\n \n\nSand was the most abundant type of sediment from the base of the sequence until ca. 1,000 \n\ncal. years B.P., persistently comprising more than 50% of total sediments (Fig. IV.4a). Until \n\nca. 3,500 cal. years B.P. it was escorted by significant amounts of gravel, together \n\nconsistently comprising more than 95% of total sediments (Fig. IV.4a). Enhanced gravel \n\ndeposition occurred between ca. 8,200 and 7,300 cal. years B.P., and again between ca. 5,600 \n\nand 4,700 cal. years B.P., with abundances ranging from 30% to 40%. These depositional \n\nevents were intercalated by a period (ca. 6,800-6,000 cal. years B.P.) when gravel decreased, \n\nreaching minimum values of ca. 20% of total sediment and this gravel depletion being \n\ncompensated by an increase of sand content up to almost 80%. \n\nBetween ca. 4,800 and 1,600 cal. years B.P., a gradual decrease of the gravel content was \n\nverified. From ca. 4,800 until 3,900 cal. years B.P. it comprised around 25% of total \n\nsediments, between ca. 3,900 and 2,700 cal. years B.P. it dropped to 10-15%, and between ca. \n\n2,700 and 1,600 cal. years B.P. it persistently attained less than 10%. This was consentaneous \n\nwith an increase of sand, which was always above 72.5% during the same period and reaching \n\nmore than 85-90% between ca. 3,900 cal. years B.P. and 1,000 cal. years B.P. Within this \n\nperiod, fines exhibited peaks of abundance around 3,000 cal. years B.P. and 1,700-1,800 cal. \n\nyears B.P., of ca. 15% and 20%, respectively. As for gravel, it showed two significant \n\nabundance peaks, at ca. 1,450-1,380 cal. years B.P. with 15-25% of total sediment, and \n\naround 1,200-1,100 cal. years B.P. with 10.5-13% (Fig. IV.4a).  \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n45 \nChapter IV. Inner shelf environment \n\nThe last ca. 1,000 years were characterized by a significant change in the depositional \n\npatterns (Fig. IV.4). Episodes of enhanced fine sedimentation (silt and clay) alternated with \n\nmostly sand depositional events, spanning for periods of more or less 100 to 300 years. \n\nDuring the period that lasted from ca. 1,060 to 930 cal. years B.P., silt increased to values of \n\n15-35%, escorting sand that roughly spanned from ca. 70% to 80%. A short event of finer \n\ndeposition took place around 1,020-1,000 cal. years B.P., with enhanced clay sedimentation \n\n(ca. 12-20%) and sand content dropping to 40-50%. It was followed by a sand peak of 70-\n\n85% between ca. 980 and 900 cal. years B.P., accompanied by a slight decrease of silt and \n\nclay to less than 5%. The period of ca. 870-840 cal. years B.P. corresponded to an episode of \n\nhigh silt and clay sedimentation, ca. 60% and 35%, respectively. From ca. 820 to 350 cal. \n\nyears B.P., deposition exhibited very low clay contents and was dominated mostly by sand \n\nand silt, which alternated as the most abundant type of sediment along time. Hence, the period \n\nbetween ca. 820 and 620 cal. years B.P. was controlled by finer deposition, whilst from ca. \n\n600 to 320 cal. years B.P. sand content ousted silt. Silt and clay again dominated \n\nsedimentation from ca. 310 to 90 cal. years B.P., and from this age until present-day clay \n\nbecame almost absent, with sand increasing again to values close to 30-40%. However, during \n\nthese last ca. 100 years that were marked by a tendency for finer deposition, an episode of \n\nenhanced coarser sedimentation occurred. It was evidenced by a significant increase of both \n\nsand and gravel at around 90-75 cal. years B.P., which show a sharp peak of abundance in a \n\nsingle event, with sand reaching 40% and gravel almost 20%. \n\n \n\nIV.1.3.2. Sand and gravel fraction compounds \n\nThe sand and gravel fractions of vibrocore 20 exhibited different distribution patterns for \n\ntheir terrigenous and biogenic compounds, but nonetheless both fractions showed a clear and \n\nsteady trend of increasing biogenic content from the base to the top of the sequence (Fig. \n\nIV.5). Sand-sized sediments were persistently dominated by terrigenous particles until ca. \n\n2,200 cal. years B.P., which showed particular high abundances (of ca. 80%) from the base of \n\nthe sequence (at ca. 9,200 cal. years B.P.) up to ca. 5,700 cal. years B.P. (Fig. IV.5.a). From \n\nca. 2,200 cal. years B.P. until the top of the sequence, deposition alternated episodes of \n\nterrigenous-dominated sand with biogenic-dominated sand (Fig. IV.5.a). Gravel-sized \n\nsediments revealed predominance of biogenic compounds throughout the sequence, except for \n\na specific depositional event centered at ca. 8,600 cal. years B.P. (Fig. IV.5.b). However, the \n\nmagnitude of the difference between the proportions of each type of gravel compounds was \n\n\n\n46 \nChapter IV. Inner shelf environment \n\nquite variable along time (Fig. IV.5.b). From the base of the sequence until ca. 3,800 cal. \n\nyears B.P., biogenic overcame terrigenous compounds but with smaller margins of difference, \n\nwhilst from that age until recent times they increased substantially and became consistently \n\n80% to almost 100% of the total gravel fraction (Fig. IV.5.b). \n\n \nFigure IV.5 \u2013 Relative abundances (%) of terrigenous and biogenic compounds along vibrocore 20 for: a) sand fraction, b) \ngravel fraction. N/D (\u2018no-data\u2019) refers to sections of the sedimentary sequence where the number of grains for counting was \nnot statistically representative and no identification was obtained. Legend: FELDS - feldspars, S/G - schist/greywackes, AGG \n- aggregates, OT - other terrigenous, BFORAMS - benthic foraminifera, OB - other bioclasts, SANDST - sandstones. \n \n\nWithin the sand fraction (Fig. IV.5.a), the oldest recorded period spanned from ca. 9,200 to \n\n8,400 cal. years B.P., and it was characterized by the highest amounts of quartz (ca. 80%) and \n\nlowest of biogenic compounds (ca. 7-9.5%). Within the terrigenous compounds, feldspars \n\nwere present up to 5% and other terrigenous (OT) particles contributed with up to almost 9%. \n\nThe biogenic component was constituted mainly by molluscs, which represented ca. 6-8% of \n\nthe total sand fraction, and some fragments (&lt;2.5%) of other bioclasts (OB). During the \n\nperiod that lasted from ca. 8,400 cal. years B.P. until ca. 5,800 cal. years B.P., the proportions \n\nof both aggregates and OT were maintained, whilst feldspars decreased substantially to less \n\nthan 1.5%. At the same time, the biogenic compounds increased twofold, with molluscs \n\nreaching almost 20% of total sand. From ca. 5,800 cal. years B.P. until 3,000 cal. years B.P., \n\nthere was a gradual and steady increase of molluscs up to almost 32%, accompanied by an \n\nincrease (up to ca. 10%) of OB particles from around 4,700 cal. years B.P. Feldspars became \n\ntotally absent from the record during this period. Between 3,000 and ca. 2,100 cal. years B.P., \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n47 \nChapter IV. Inner shelf environment \n\nsand became also devoid of aggregates. From ca. 2,100 and 1,700 cal. years B.P., OB \n\nincreased to a maximum of ca. 13%, simultaneously with a fall in quartz abundance values \n\ndown to ca. 40%. A new peak of terrigenous, mainly quartz, occurred at ca. 1,600-1,500 cal. \n\nyears B.P., and it was contemporaneous with a decrease of OB particles. From this age until \n\nca. 900 cal. years B.P., quartz decreased, while OB increased. Benthic foraminifera increased, \n\nalthough remaining with very low abundances of ca. 1-2.5%. At around 820 cal. years B.P., \n\nthe highest amount of molluscs was verified, composing ca. 60% of the sand, concurrently \n\nwith the lowest abundance of quartz, which was less than 20%. The phase between ca. 760 \n\nand 520 cal. years B.P. witnessed enhanced sedimentation of mica, which was up to almost \n\n7.5%. Also, quartz increased again to ca. 30-40% and molluscs decreased from 60% to less \n\nthan 50%. Another event of reduced terrigenous contribution took place at around 370 cal. \n\nyears B.P., with less amounts of both quartz (25%) and mica (ca. 2.5%), attended by an \n\nincrease of all biogenic compounds, in particular molluscs (ca. 55%) and OB (ca. 10%). It \n\nwas followed by an episode of some reverse tendency, centered at ca. 300 cal. years B.P., \n\ncharacterized by an enhancement of quartz and mica deposition (ca. 40% and 6.5%, \n\nrespectively), concomitant with a decrease in molluscs down to 25%. From this age until \n\nrecent times, the abundances of terrigenous and biogenic compounds fluctuated around the \n\nsame range of values. Quartz remained with lower abundances of 17% to less than 30%, mica \n\naround 3-4%, OT roughly 10%, benthic foraminifera between 2% and 5.5%, molluscs from \n\n35% to 45% and OB from ca. 13% up to 20%. In general, deposition of sand was always \n\ndominated by quartz and molluscs, which alternated as the predominant component along \n\ntime. They were accompanied by a more or less stable contribution of OT and OB particles, \n\nand by increased abundances of benthic foraminifera and mica from ca. 1,800 and 850 cal. \n\nyears B.P., respectively, up to the top of the sequence. \n\nConcerning the gravel fraction (Fig. IV.5.b), its abundance was not significant from the \n\nbase of the sequence until close to 8,800 cal. years B.P. and thus the oldest considered period \n\nfor its analysis was from ca. 8,800 to 8,500 cal. years B.P. It was characterized by the highest \n\namount of terrigenous in the entire sedimentary sequence. Quartz (which included low \n\namounts of quartzite) reached almost 50% of the total gravel fraction, whilst \n\nschist/greywackes also presented their highest abundances within the sequence (ca. 2-4.5%) \n\nand aggregates were 12.5%. The biogenic compounds were dominated almost exclusively by \n\nmolluscs, with about 38% of total gravel. Between ca. 8,500 and 4,700 cal. years B.P., gravel \n\nwas dominated by molluscs, which increased gradually from 50% until close to 72%, and the \n\nwhole biogenic compound started to increase significantly from around 5,800 cal. years B.P. \n\n\n\n48 \nChapter IV. Inner shelf environment \n\nonwards. During this period, quartz decreased gradually from ca. 37% to 19% and \n\nschist/greywackes also diminished to 1-2%. Feldspars were present only at ca. 8,400 cal. \n\nyears B.P. with 2% abundance. As for aggregate particles, their quantity was constantly \n\naround 7-9%, except for two peaks at ca. 7,500 cal. years B.P. and 5,800 cal. years B.P., with \n\n12.7% and 14.5%, respectively. Sandstones were constricted to around 6,600 cal. years B.P. \n\nwith only 1.4%. The roughly 1,000 years-period that spanned from ca. 4,700 to 3,900 cal. \n\nyears B.P. was marked by a further increase of molluscs up to ca. 83%, and a concomitant \n\ndecrease of quartz down to ca. 9%. Aggregates also fell to values of 7.5-4.7% and \n\nschist/greywackes became less than 1%. During the next ca. 1,500 years, until ca. 2,400 cal. \n\nyears B.P., the gravel fraction became much reduced. It witnessed an increase of the biogenic \n\ncompounds, with molluscs reaching almost 90%, together with a decrease of quartz to values \n\nbelow 7%, and the total disappearance of schist/greywackes and sandstones. Gravel became \n\nagain statistically representative at ca. 1,600 cal. years B.P. and lasting until ca. 1,100 cal. \n\nyears B.P. The first hundred years of this period (ca. 1,600-1,500 cal. years B.P.) witnessed a \n\ndrop in quartz to less than 1% and a return of sandstones that reached 4.5%, with both \n\ncompounds representing the total contribution of terrigenous to the gravel fraction. As for the \n\nbiogenic, molluscs surpassed 90% and OB particles were around 3.5-1.5%. From ca. 1,500 to \n\n1,100 cal. years B.P., quartz became totally absent and sandstones the predominant \n\nterrigenous compound (up to 4.5%). Molluscs clearly dominated gravel during this time with \n\nca. 93-99%. From ca. 980 to 900 cal. years B.P., they were accompanied by vestigial amounts \n\nof OB particles, sandstones and aggregates (ca. 1.5%). A hiatus in gravel deposition occurred \n\nagain from ca. 800 to 600 cal. years B.P., followed by more or less one hundred years (ca. \n\n520-440 cal. years B.P.) of fully biogenic gravel-sized particles, almost exclusively composed \n\nby molluscs (98-100%). From ca. 440 cal. years B.P. to present-day, gravel became once \n\nmore statistically non-representative. \n\n \n\nIV.1.3.3. Quartz shape and surface texture \n\nThe shape (morphometry) and surface texture (morphoscopy) analyses of sandy quartz \n\nalong vibrocore 20 revealed that high sphericity, rounded (SUBR, R and WR) and \n\nsimultaneously smooth-shinning grains dominated sediments at this site of the inner shelf for \n\nmost of the studied period (Fig. IV.6). \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n49 \nChapter IV.

Within this period, a localized event around 8,400 cal. \n\nyears B.P. occurred, with high-sphericity grains reaching 76% of total sandy quartz. In the \n\nperiod between ca. 6,600 and 3,900 cal. years B.P., high and low sphericity grains alternated \n\nas the predominant quartz type. Two events with high sphericity quartz composing as much as \n\n75% of total grains took place at ca. 6,600 cal. years B.P. and 4,700 cal. years B.P. They were \n\nintercalated by other two events, at around 5,800 and 3,900 cal. years B.P., in which the \n\nabundances of low sphericity grains greatly increased to ca. 45% and 53%, respectively. From \n\nca. 3,000 to 1,600 cal. years B.P., the proportions of sphericity types were rather stable and \n\nhigh sphericity quartz dominated with ca. 60-70%. A phase evidenced by the highest \n\nabundance values of high sphericity quartz (73-77%) along the sequence took place from ca. \n\n1,500 cal. years B.P. until ca. 1,100 cal. years B.P. It was followed by a peak (ca. 40%) of low \n\nsphericity grains at ca. 1,000 cal. years B.P., and again by a short period (980-900 cal. years \n\nB.P.) of input of high sphericity grains (ca. 72-73%). The time between 760 and 520 cal. \n\nyears B.P. was characterized by another increase of low sphericity quartz, which ranged from \n\n39% to 46%, although a peak of high sphericity (72%) was centered at ca. 590 cal. years B.P. \n\nFrom ca. 440 cal. years B.P. until recent times, high sphericity grains increased with \n\n\n\n50 \nChapter IV. Inner shelf environment \n\nabundances ranging from 65% to 72%, except for a drop to 60% very close to the top of the \n\nsedimentary record (at ca. 20 cal. years B.P.). \n\nThe analysis of the roundness of quartz grains (Fig. IV.6.b) revealed that from ca. 9,200 to \n\n8,400 cal. years B.P., the record was dominated by rounded forms (SUBR, R and WR) but \n\nthere were also significant proportions of angular forms (mainly A with 10-13% and SUBA \n\nwith 10-18%). Subrounded (SUBR) quartz generally oscillated between ca. 35% and 40%, \n\nwhilst rounded (R) quartz fluctuated between around 30% and 40%. Well rounded (WR) \n\ngrains were practically absent from the record until ca. 8,800 cal. years B.P., and from that \n\nage until ca. 8,400 cal. years B.P. increased up to 10-13%. A specific event was registered at \n\nca. 8,200 cal. years B.P., with angular (A) grains dropping to below 10%, SUBR reaching \n\n40% of total quartz and WR grains reaching a peak of 15%. From ca. 8,200 until 5,800 cal. \n\nyears B.P. the abundance of SUBA grains increased to ca. 20-25% and conversely the R \n\ngrains decreased to 23-28%, as well as the WR grains that were reduced to less than 10%. At \n\nthe same time, A quartz was reduced to less than 10%. Between ca. 5,500 and 3,600 cal. years \n\nB.P., rounded forms again increased with SUBR grains reaching almost 50% of total quartz. \n\nThe phase from around 3,600 cal. years B.P. to 1,800-1,700 cal. years B.P. witnessed a further \n\nincrease of rounded (R) quartz up to 40%. The time interval 1,800-1,300 cal. years B.P. \n\nevidenced another rise of all angular forms, which constituted nearly 35% of total grains. \n\nFrom ca. 1,200 until 760 cal. years B.P. this tendency was reverted, with SUBA and A quartz \n\ndiminishing to less than 10%. At the same time, SUBR grains reached abundances of up to \n\nalmost 50%, R grains of up to ca. 40% and WR grains attained their highest value within the \n\nsedimentary sequence, of almost 20%. The next ca. 700 years, lasting until recent times, were \n\ndistinguished by a gradual return to angular forms as SUBA and A quartz increased up to 20-\n\n30%, and particularly R grains diminished to below 20%. Specifically VA quartz reached ca. \n\n10% in a single depositional episode centered at ca. 75 cal. years B.P, coincident with the \n\ntotal disappearance of WR grains. \n\nRegarding the study of quartz surface texture (Fig. IV.6.c), from the base of the sequence \n\nuntil ca. 8,500 cal. years B.P. there were significant amounts (up to 17%) of not-worn (NU) \n\nquartz reaching this area, along with smooth-shining (EL) grains that dominated sands with \n\nca. 75-85%. From ca. 8,400 to 5,800 cal. years B.P., grains with a mixed signature of smooth-\n\nshining and rounded-frosted (EL+RM) gained expression, composing between ca. 15% and \n\nalmost 30% of total quartz. Contemporaneously, both NU and EL decreased to mean values \n\nof ca. 10% and 65%, respectively. The period ranging from ca. 5,500 to 3,800 cal. years B.P. \n\nwas marked by a higher contribution of RM quartz (ca. 6%). A subsequent phase lasting ca. \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n51 \nChapter IV. Inner shelf environment \n\n300 years (from ca. 1,700 to 1,400 cal. years B.P.) was marked by an increase of NU grains \n\nup to ca. 25%, which then dropped to less than 5% at ca. 1,000 cal. years B.P., coincident \n\nwith a peak of EL+RM grains of ca. 35%. A period of ca. 400 years followed, in which the \n\ncontribution of NU again augmented to 10-16% and EL quartz decreased to ca. 50-60%. A \n\nwell marked episode centered around 450-370 cal. years B.P. was determined by a drop in \n\nNU abundance to its lowest values within the sedimentary sequence (ca.3-8%). At the same \n\ntime, EL grains increased to almost 70% and EL+RM quartz disappeared from the record. \n\nThe next ca. 300 years witnessed a gradual recovery of NU, in parallel with a decrease of EL \n\ngrains to values below 50% and an increase of EL+RM grains to ca. 35-45%. This period \n\nculminated with an event at ca. 75 cal. years B.P., characterized by the highest values of NU \n\n(ca. 30%) and mixed EL+RM (57%) grains along the entire sequence. Simultaneously, EL \n\ndropped to their lowermost abundance within the sequence, of ca. 10%. \n\n \n\nIV.2. Discussion \n\nThe multi-proxy sedimentological analysis conducted in vibrocore 20 unravelled a \n\nsuccession of different depositional environments on this location of the Guadiana inner shelf \n\nfor the period spanning from ca. 9,200 cal. years B.P until present-day. These depositional \n\ndomains were distinguished by key sedimentological features (or evolutionary trends of such \n\nfeatures), identified on basis of significant variations occurring within the set of the analysed \n\nproxies. For the last ca. 2,000, the higher resolution of the sedimentary record allowed a more \n\ndetailed interpretation of events and the direct comparison with Historical information. This \n\nenabled the evaluation of the combined action of anthropogenic and recent climate impacts, \n\nwhich was one of the main aims of the present work. \n\nIV.2.1. Depositional environments \n\nBased on the previously mentioned key sedimentological features and trends, four main \n\ndepositional stages were identified along the sedimentary record of vibrocore 20 for the \n\nevolution of this area throughout the analysed period (Fig. IV.7). \n\nStage 1: from ca. 9,200 until 8,500-8,200 cal. years B.P. \n\nThe first stage developed during the early Holocene (Fig. IV.7) and was characterized by \n\napparently low sedimentation rates of about 54 cm/ka cal. B.P. (Fig. IV.3). This period \n\ncorresponded to a time when the postglacial sea-level rise that marked the beginning of the \n\nHolocene was already in motion, as has been recognized since about 13,000-10,000 cal. years \n\n\n\n52 \nChapter IV. Inner shelf environment \n\nB.P. in several other regional coastal and marine archives for the same region (Dabrio et al., \n\n2000; Lario et al., 2002; Boski et al., 2002, Teixeira et al., 2005; Boski et al., 2008; Zazo et \n\nal., 2008) (Fig. II.7b). The sea-level rise certainly explains in part the inferred low \n\nsedimentation rates, as the sediments transported by the Guadiana River were partially \n\nretained inside the estuary. On the other hand, the existing lower sea level implied that this \n\nlocation was in a different environmental setting than today, and under a distinct sediment-\n\nsupply regime as our data seem to suggest. Sand clearly dominated deposition at this time, \n\nwhilst silt and clay were absent from the record (Figs. IV.4a and IV.7). The terrigenous \n\ncompounds exhibited their highest contribution to this area during this stage, dominating the \n\nsand and gravel fractions (Figs. IV.5 and IV.7). Within terrigenous sand, the highest amounts \n\nof quartz and lowest of biogenic compounds were verified, together with the highest content \n\nof feldspars in all of the sequence, and a significant content of OT particles (Figs. IV.5a and \n\nIV.7). Within terrigenous gravel, the most noticeable feature was the presence of Paleozoic \n\nschists/greywacke (S/G), which exhibited their highest abundances of the record, and also a \n\nnoteworthy contribution of aggregates (Figs. IV.5b and IV.7). The biogenic component of \n\nboth coarse fractions was composed almost exclusively by mollusc shells throughout this \n\nstage (Figs. IV.5 and IV.7). In what concerns sandy quartz, there was a predominance of \n\nsmooth-shinning, rounded (mostly SUBR and R) and of spherical grains, although significant \n\nproportions of angular forms and an important contribution of not-worn grains also \n\ncharacterized this site during this time (Figs. IV.6 and IV.7). \n\nThe clear dominance of sand, coupled with the absence of silt and clay material (Figs. \n\nIV.4a and IV.7), speaks in favor of a depositional environment where the prevailing \n\nconditions didn\u2019t allow for the settling of fluvial-derived fine sediments. Present-day \n\ndepositional patterns at identical depths of the inner shelf indicate that it is currently under the \n\ninfluence of the Guadiana River suspended load discharges (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2004; Gonz\u00e1lez \n\net al., 2007; Rosa et al., 2013). Although sand typically dominates sediments at almost all \n\ndepths of the inner shelf, continental-derived fine material has been found to be quite \n\nsignificant at the deepest areas of the inner shelf in the vicinity of the Guadiana River mouth, \n\nspecifically below ca. 10 m water depth (Rosa et al., 2013). The absence of this riverine \n\nimprint during the beginning of the Holocene at this site is most probably linked with the \n\nlower sea levels that prevailed prior to and during the initial phases of the postglacial \n\nFlandrian marine transgression. Several studies conducted worldwide, including in the North \n\nAtlantic and more specifically in the Algarve coast and the Gulf of Cadis, have established \n\nsea-level rise curves for this period and are consensual in that the sea level was by then many \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n53 \nChapter IV. Inner shelf environment \n\nmeters below its present-day position. In general, these curves seem to place the site of \n\nvibrocore 20 above sea level (Fig. II.7) but almost any of them agree on the exact magnitude \n\nof the lowered sea level, in some cases differing for more than 10 meters (Fig. II.7), thus \n\nreflecting the high degree of uncertainty that can be inherent to such reconstructions. Namely \n\nthe two curves established specifically for the Algarve region, those of Teixeira et al. (2005) \n\nand of Delgado et al. (2012), indicate quite different sea levels for this period (Fig. II.7b; from \n\nca. -11 to -4 m and from ca. -27 to -15 m, respectively, for the period 9,200 until 8,500-8,200 \n\ncal. years B.P.). The latter puts indeed the current site of vibrocore 20 some meters above sea \n\nlevel at the beginning of the Holocene transgression, but its margin of error is rather high. On \n\nthe contrary, the previous points to a different situation, in which this site would be very close \n\nto the coastline, and by the end of the present stage already ca. 10 m under the sea level. \n\nConsidering this last scenario, the actual site of vibrocore 20 would have stand in an even \n\nshallower domain, probably transitional, or where deposition would be more identical to what \n\nhas been detected in modern proximal areas above ca. 10 m that exhibit almost no muddy \n\nsediments and a strong domination of continental-derived terrigenous compounds (Gonz\u00e1lez \n\net al., 2004 and 2007; Rosa et al., 2013). The bed-load exported by the Guadiana River into \n\nthe coast (Portela et al., 2004) that concentrates mainly in the proximal areas near the river \n\nmouth (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2004), and the contribution of the littoral drift, which is mainly \n\ncomposed of sand and stands as a crucial regional sediment source into the Guadiana shelf \n\n(Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2004), would dominate deposition in this area. Furthermore, data regarding \n\nthe early Holocene evolution of the Guadiana Estuary (Boski et al., 2002) point to an \n\naccelerated phase of estuarine infilling by clayey sediments, between ca. 11,000 cal. years \n\nB.P. and 8,200-7,800 cal. years B.P. Consequently, it is expectable that the fluvial exports to \n\nthe coast were by then deprived of a great amount of its suspended load. This in turn would \n\nfacilitate the remobilization of this material from the shallow areas in the vicinity of the river \n\nmouth and the deposition would chiefly correspond to coarser sediments, as it seems to have \n\nbeen recorded in this location at this time. \n\nConcurrently, the most significant presence within the record of several fluvial-originated \n\nterrigenous compounds, both in the gravel and in the sand fractions (Figs. IV.5 and IV.7), \n\nseems to confirm the existence of such a depositional setting in this location. Coastal \n\ndepositional processes in areas close to fluvial sediment sources have been acknowledged as \n\naccumulation spots for continental-derived coarse terrigenous particles (e.g., L\u00f3pez-Galindo \n\net al., 1999; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2004 and 2007; Rosa et al., 2013). In particular, the contribution \n\nof feldspars and the high contents of OT particles clearly reveal the strong influence of the \n\n\n\n54 \nChapter IV. Inner shelf environment \n\nGuadiana bed-load discharges. The OT particles are generated by the dismantling of igneous \n\nand metamorphic rocks along the Guadiana River basin and don\u2019t resist during long transport \n\npaths, thus concentrating in proximity to the sediment source where the system is able to \n\npreserve less these stable elements, namely in the deltaic bulge just off the river mouth and \n\ndown to 5m water depth where sediments are coarser (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2004; Rosa et al., \n\n2013). The same studies concluded that the fluvial-supplied OT tend to escort highly \n\nabundant marine shells (molluscs) at shallower waters just off the river mouth, which reflects \n\nquite well the general composition of sediments during this stage. Accordantly, the presence \n\nof feldspars has also been signalized at shallower depths under close continental sediment \n\nsupplies, in neighbouring shelf areas of the Gulf of Cadis (L\u00f3pez-Galindo et al., 1999). As for \n\nthe gravel-sized S/G particles that are exclusively originated in the outcrops of the Guadiana \n\nRiver basin, they have been related with the direct fluvial exportations onto the inner shelf \n\nand reported to peak out immediately off the river mouth, always escorting  local OT \n\ndepocenters (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2004 and 2007). The lowermost content of both the gravel- and \n\nsand-fraction biogenic compound, almost exclusively mollusc shells (Figs. IV.5 and IV.7), it \n\nis also indicative of a very proximal coastal domain. Transgressive deposits previously \n\nidentified on the Guadiana shelf, characterized as well by high amounts of quartz and OT \n\nparticles associated with S/G particles and comparatively low amounts of bioclasts, have been \n\nassociated with a higher-energy and more proximal domain impacted by floods in the \n\nGuadiana Basin, namely a detritical fan (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2004). This study raised possibility \n\nthat the lower sea levels implied the existence of an older detritical system at the beginning of \n\nthe transgression, transporting sediments southward from the present-day Guadiana River \n\nmouth (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2004). The long term export patterns disclosure by sandy quartz seem \n\nto support this hypothesis. Although it cannot be disregarded the importance of reworking \n\nprocesses associated with coastal and littoral drift currents that are attested by predominant \n\nsmooth-shinning and tended rounded spherical grains (Figs. IV.6 and IV.7), the significant \n\ncontribution of angular and not-worn grains (Figs. IV.6 and IV.7) corroborates the scenario of \n\nenhanced impact of the fluvial bed-load discharges during this period. Modern distribution of \n\nquartz on the Guadiana shelf features larger quantities of not-worn grains in the vicinity of the \n\nriver mouth, namely in the deltaic bulge area, directly associated with sediment input from the \n\nGuadiana basin (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2007). In the same way, angular quartz usually points to \n\nweak reworking and low remobilization that indicate proximity to the sediment sources.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nChapter V \n \n \nMIDDLE SHELF MUD BODY \n  \n\n\n\n76 \nChapter V. Middle shelf mud body \n\nV.1. Results \n\nV.1.1. Lithological description and profiles \n\nThe lithological description of the mud body sedimentary sequences was based on the \n\ndirect observation of the deposits. This was carried out immediately after the vibrocores were \n\nopened and before sampling. The preliminary description of these deposits allowed the \n\nconstruction of log profiles for vibrocores 1, 6 and 14, aimed for the present study (Figs. V.1, \n\nV.2 and V.3). They have been intended to help visualize the general aspect of the main \n\nsedimentological features and fossiliferous content that characterized the three sequences \n\nretrieved from the Guadiana mud body. \n\nThe sequence of vibrocore 1 (Fig. V.1) started at ca. 15,345 cal. B.P. (376-378 cm core \n\ndepth) with the deposition of sandy muds escorted by small contents of gravel. The visible \n\nbioclastic content was very reduced and limited to some small-sized mollusc shell fragments. \n\nClose to the base of the core, this unit was characterized by more enhanced mud contents. \n\nThey gradually decreased upwards in detriment of sand and gravel, until ca. 292 cm core \n\ndepth, where an abrupt change in sedimentation set the terminus of this unit. \n\nThe above unit went from ca. 292 cm until ca. 243 cm core depth and represented a period \n\nof finer sedimentation in this area. Deposits became clearly dominated by compact mud (silt \n\nand clay), as sand decreased to half and gravel became absent. No visible bioclastic content \n\nwas detected within these deposits. \n\nThe unit from ca. 243 cm until ca. 186 cm core depth showed again a gradual coarsening \n\nof sediments, with sand becoming dominant towards the top of the unit. Bioclastic remains \n\nappeared as rare near the base of the unit but small fragments of shells became much more \n\nabundant from ca. 205 cm core depth upwards. \n\nThe overlaying unit that corresponded to the core depth-interval 186-128 cm, was marked \n\nby an increase of fine sediments, with mud content surpassing sand. Visible bioclasts were \n\nabsent from this entire section of the core, except for one isolated bivalve shell found in the \n\ntransition between the previous unit and the current one. \n\nA thin semi-liquid horizon (128-124 cm core depth) overlaid the preceding unit and was \n\ncharacterized by higher contents of sand and gravel. From here up to ca. 80 cm core depth, \n\nsediments consisted on a monotonous sequence of dark silty clays with no visible bioclasts. \n\nAt the top of this unit, a thin anoxic layer marked the transition to the overlaying unit. \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n77 \nChapter V.

Upwards, from this level until around 26 cm core depth (top level of the \n\nunit) deposition returned steadily and gradually to finer sediments. \n\nThe top-most unit of vibrocore 1 (ca. 26-0 cm core depth) was composed almost \n\nexclusively of muds, mainly due to the enhancement of clayey sedimentation. \n\nThe sequence of vibrocore 6 (Fig. V.2) started around 12,500 cal. B.P. (297-299 cm core \n\ndepth) with the deposition of uniform clayey silts showing some content of sands, which \n\ncharacterized sedimentation until ca. 243 cm core depth. To the top of the unit, a few larger \n\nmollusc shells were present. \n\n\n\n78 \nChapter V. Middle shelf mud body \n\n \nFigure V.2 \u2013 Log profile of vibrocore 6. Fine sediments (silt and clay) stand as \u2018mud\u2019 whenever deposits were a mixture of \ngravel, sand and fines, or separately as \u2018silt\u2019 and \u2018clay\u2019 when deposits were composed only by sand and fines. \u2018Shells\u2019 \nrepresent mixed and mainly broken bioclastic content, with different symbol sizes attesting for the dimensional variability of \nthe bioclasts found within the sediment layers. \n \n\nBetween core levels 243 cm and 106 cm, deposition was dominated by a thick unit of \n\nmuds with enhanced sand content and small amounts of gravel-sized particles. The \n\ndimensional composition of sediments remained rather constant with only small fluctuations, \n\nbut some important variations of the bioclastic content were observed. Until ca. 223 cm core \n\ndepth, sediments were devoid of visible bioclasts, except for some very small fragments of \n\nmollusc shells and one larger gastropod shell found at level 219 cm. The section ranging from \n\nca. 223 cm to ca. 153 cm continued to present small fragments of shells and specifically the \n\ninterval 170-153 cm evidenced several marks of bioturbation. Between ca. 153 cm core depth \n\nand the top of the unit (at 106 cm) most deposits were devoid of visible bioclasts, except for \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n79 \nChapter V. Middle shelf mud body \n\ntwo specific thin layers with concentrated small fragments of shells and gastropods, at levels \n\n142-138 cm and 116-112 cm, respectively. \n\nA thick unit developed between core levels ca. 106 cm and 39 cm, corresponding to a \n\nmonotonous succession of clayey silts with much reduced sand content and almost total \n\nabsence of visible bioclasts, although a few small fragments were identified at ca. 70-80 cm \n\ncore depth and near the top of the unit. \n\nUpwards, from ca. 39 cm to 31 cm core depth a ca. 10 cm-thick horizon was deposited. \n\nSediments consisted of even more abundant silt with significant clay content, whilst sand \n\ndisappeared from the record. \n\nThe overlaying unit comprised about 14 cm (from ca. 31 to 17 cm core depth) and \n\nevidenced a turn in the dominant size-fraction, with sediments becoming finer as clay content \n\nexceeded silt.  \n\nThe upper-most unit, going from ca. 17 cm core depth until the top of the sequence, \n\nconsisted of once again silt-dominated sediments, with an important clay contribution. Close \n\nto the bottom of the unit, a black anoxic thin layer rich in organic debris was detected. \n\nBioclasts continued to be absent from the deposits.  \n\nThe sequence of vibrocore 14 (Fig. V.3) started around 2,500 cal. B.P. (239-241.5 cm core \n\ndepth) with the deposition of a very coarse layer (ca. 8.5 cm-thick), dominated by sandy \n\nsediments with important gravel content. Mud was present but in very low amounts. No \n\nvisible bioclasts were detected. \n\nThe above unit corresponded to the depth interval 233-225 cm and consisted on much finer \n\nsediments that were dominated by muds. Fine sands and gravel-sized particles were also \n\npresent but in small amounts, whilst visible bioclasts remained absent. \n\nA thin horizon between 225 cm and 221 cm was again composed of coarser sediments, \n\nwith gravel content surpassing mud. Small fragments of shells began to appear within these \n\ndeposits. \n\nA new shift in deposition occurred between core levels 221 cm and 209 cm, with enhanced \n\nmud contribution and small quantities of both gravel and sand. Larger fragments of mollusc \n\nshells were present, together with a few unbroken bivalve shells. \n\nThe unit established at the core depth-interval 209-197 cm corresponded to another coarser \n\ndepositional event due to higher input of gravel, despite muds continuing to dominate \n\nsediments. Fragments of shells of various dimensions were identified. \n\n\n\n80 \nChapter V. Middle shelf mud body \n\n \nFigure V.3 \u2013 Log profile of vibrocore 14. Fine sediments (silt and clay) stand as \u2018mud\u2019 whenever deposits were a mixture of \ngravel, sand and fines, or separately as \u2018silt\u2019 and \u2018clay\u2019 when deposits were composed only by sand and fines. \u2018Shells\u2019 \nrepresent mixed and mainly broken bioclastic content, with different symbol sizes attesting for the dimensional variability of \nthe bioclasts found within the sediment layers. \n \n\nA thick unit developed between core levels 197 cm and 153 cm, dominated by muds but \n\nwith a significant contribution of sands. The bioclastic content was abundant, consisting of \n\nmedium-large fragments of mollusc shells and several unbroken bivalves. From the base to \n\nthe top of the unit, a slight and gradual fining tendency of the sediments was observed. \n\nThe transition from the previous unit to the above one, at the core depth-interval of 153-84 \n\ncm, was gradational and the upwards fining trend previously observed was maintained. This \n\nunit was dominated by silt and clay, although a small contribution of sand-sized sediments \n\npersisted. The visible bioclastic content diminished and was sparse, consisting only on small \n\nmollusc fragments. \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n81 \nChapter V. Middle shelf mud body \n\nAnother very thick unit developed between ca. 84 cm and 14 cm core depth. The transition \n\nwas again gradational with an even more pronounced domination of fine sediments, as the \n\ndeposits were composed almost exclusively of silts and clays. There was no visible bioclastic \n\ncontent. \n\nThe uppermost unit (last ca. 14 cm of deposition) marked another return to a somewhat \n\ncoarser trend, as muds continued to clearly dominate sediments but there was an increase of \n\nthe sand content. Again, no visible bioclasts were identified within the topmost unit of the \n\nsequence. \n\n \n\nV.1.2. Age models \n\nAge models were constructed for the three mud body vibrocores, based on a total of eleven \n\nAMS radiocarbon datings obtained at selected depth levels along-core. In all vibrocores, the \n\noldest dating was obtained near the base of the sequences, allowing in each one to establish an \n\nage for the oldest recorded sediments. Conventional radiocarbon ages are reported as years \n\n\u2018before present\u2019 (B.P., \u2018present\u2019 = 1,950 A.D.). Calendar calibrated ages are reported as years \n\n\u2018before Christ\u2019 or \u2018Anno Domini\u2019 (B.C./A.D.), and calibrated ages as years \u2018before present\u2019 \n\n(B.P.). All information concerning the dated levels, sample laboratory codes, radiocarbon and \n\ncalibrated dating results, is summarized in Table V.1. \n\nIn the case of vibrocore 1 (Fig. V.4a), the base-level dating attributed an age of 15,758-\n\n14,932 cal. years B.P. to the sedimentary sequence, making it the oldest of the three \n\nvibrocores. At core level 272-274, an age of ca. 14,385-13,707 cal. years B.P. was estimated. \n\nWhere a transition to more muddy sediments occurred, level 182-184 cm was dated as being \n\nca. 12,641-11,693 cal. years B.P. Age estimation attained at level 146-148 cm provided a date \n\nof 7,149-6,628 cal. years B.P. for these sediments. At level 120-122 cm, close to a further \n\nincrease of muds towards the top of the sequence, the youngest age obtained for the record \n\ncorresponded to 2,272-1,726 cal. years B.P. \n\nFor vibrocore 6 (Fig. V.4b), the oldest date was obtained at core level 297-299 cm and \n\ncorresponded to an age of ca. 12,816-12,111 cal. years B.P. At level 199-201 cm, dating \n\nresults revealed an age of 5,928-5,475 cal. years B.P. Around a small peak of sand and gravel, \n\ndating analyses performed at 149-151 cm core depth indicated an age of 3,147-2,570 cal. \n\nyears B.P. Finally, the most recent age acquired for this sequence was of 1,045-817 cal. years \n\nB.P. at level 108-110 cm, when a clear shift to enhanced mud deposition was set. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n82 \nChapter V.

The age of \n\n2,787-2,302 cal. years B.P. attributed to the base-level of the core (238-241.5 cm) revealed it \n\nto be the youngest sedimentary sequence of the three that were analysed. The second dating \n\nwas carried out at level 132-136 cm, coincident with a depositional change towards enhanced \n\nsilt contents that determined a definitive fining-up trend of sediments, and revealed an age of \n\n909-707 cal. years B.P. \n\nSedimentation rates on the mud body evidenced an apparent generalized rising tendency \n\nalong time, although vibrocore 1 seemed to reveal a long period with very low values that \n\nlasted from the beginning of the Holocene until around late Holocene (Fig. V.5). \n\nThe sequence of vibrocore 1 (Fig. V.5a) exhibited mean sedimentation rates ranging \n\nbetween ca. 80 cm/ka and 48 cm/ka for the late Pleistocene- early Holocene period of the \n\nrecord, lasting from ca. 15,500 cal. years B.P. (at the base of the vibrocore) until ca. 12,000 \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n83 \nChapter V. Middle shelf mud body \n\ncal. years B.P. Roughly coincident with the onset of the Holocene (11,700 cal. years B.P.), at \n\nca. 12,000 cal. years B.P., there was an apparent accentuated drop of the rates, down to ca. 5 \n\ncm/ka. These values seem to have persisted until close to 6,000 cal. years B.P. and then \n\nslightly increased to around 6.8 cm/ka, which apparently was maintained throughout the mid- \n\nand until late-Holocene. Around 2,000 cal. years B.P., the rates increased to values more close \n\nto those prior to the beginning of the Holocene, reaching ca. 60.5 cm/ka. \n\nFigure V.4 \u2013 Depth (cm), grain-size composition and levels selected for dating analysis along: a) vibrocore 1, b) vibrocore 6 \nand c) vibrocore 14. Dating results are given in radiocarbon years B.P. and calibrated ages (cal. years B.P.). \n\n \n\n \nFigure V.5 \u2013 Age models and sedimentation rates (cm/ka) on the mud body: a) vibrocore 1, b) vibrocore 6, and c) \nvibrocore 14. The error-bars in the control-points of the age model curves represent the uncertainty (2?) of the calibrated \ndates. \n \n\nThe sequence of vibrocore 6 (Fig. V.5b) appeared to have presented lower sedimentation \n\nrates for the oldest deposits, followed by a persistent increase throughout the Holocene. From \n\nca. 12,500 cal. years B.P. until close to 6,000 cal. years B.P., the apparent mean rates were of \n\nca. 14.5 cm/ka. Between this date and around 3,000 cal. years B.P. they slightly increased to \n\nca. 17.5 cm/ka, and again for the period that lasted until ca. 1,000 cal. years B.P., reaching ca. \n\n\n\n84 \nChapter V. Middle shelf mud body \n\n21 cm/ka. The last 1,000 years apparently recorded a significant increment of the mean rates \n\nthat reached close to 120 cm/ka. \n\nThe sequence of vibrocore 14 (Fig. V.5c), which comprised only the late Holocene, \n\nprovided a similar evolutionary trend of the sedimentation rates. The almost two first \n\nmillennia that have been recorded at this site, from ca. 2,500 cal. years B.P. until ca. 800 cal. \n\nyears B.P., were characterized by rates of about 60 cm/ka. During the last ca. 800 years, the \n\nrates increased more than twofold and reached values of ca. 165 cm/ka. \n\n \n\nV.1.3. Sediment characterization \n\nV.1.3.1. Grain-size \n\nThe grain-size composition (sedimentary texture) of the mud body sequences (Fig. V.6) \n\nrevealed a persistent dominance of fines (usually > 60-70% of total sediments) and a \n\ngeneralized fining-up tendency, with particularly enhanced silt and clay deposition from \n\naround 2,000 cal years B.P. (vibrocore 1) and 1,000 cal. years B.P. (vibrocores 6 and 14). It is \n\nalso worth of noting that the three sequences exhibited very identical grain-size compositional \n\nand mean patterns for the same periods along the time record (Fig. V.6). \n\n \nFigure V.6 \u2013 Sediment grain-size composition (%) and mean grain-size (phi - ?) on the mud body: a) and b) vibrocore 1; c) \nand d) vibrocore 6; e) and f) vibrocore 14. \n\n \n\nThe sequence of vibrocore 1 (Fig. V.6a-b) initiated at ca. 15,345 cal. years B.P. with a \n\nseries of depositional cycles that alternated enhanced coarse-sized sediments, particularly \n\nsand, with greater inputs of fine material to the mid-shelf. These cycles started as shorter \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n85 \nChapter V. Middle shelf mud body \n\nepisodes of about 500 year-depositional periods from ca. 15,500 until 14,250 cal. years B.P., \n\nand became longer towards the beginning of the Holocene, close to 12,000-11,500 cal. years \n\nB.P. The early Holocene around 12,000 cal. years B.P. was marked by an increase of fines, \n\nnoticeably of silt, and a concurrent decrease of sands. This depositional pattern was \n\nmaintained relatively constant throughout most of the Holocene, with only some fluctuations \n\nmainly around the relative proportions of sand- and clay-sized sediments. Around 3,000-2,500 \n\ncal. years B.P. an episode of enhanced gravel input occurred, setting the transition to a new \n\ndepositional phase. It started at about 2,200 cal. years B.P. with silt-dominated deposition \n\naccompanied by ca. 40% of clay and almost 10% of sand, which gradually passed to a clay-\n\ndominated environment (almost 60% of clay). Simultaneously, sand content diminished \n\nupwards until it became absent at ca. 1,250 cal. years B.P. Around this date, another rapid \n\nchange in sedimentation determined a shift to the next phase, as sands reappeared with ca. \n\n15% in detriment of clay material. From 1,250 cal. years B.P. until close to 300 cal. years \n\nB.P., sand was always significant within the deposits but slowly decreasing towards the top. \n\nAt ca. 300 cal. years B.P., sand disappeared from the record, concomitantly with an increase \n\nof clay content that persisted until recent times. \n\nThe sequence of vibrocore 6 (Fig. V.6c-d) was permanently dominated by muddy \n\nsediments from the base until the top of the record but evident oscillations on the abundances \n\nof all the textural classes did occur. The record started in early Holocene at ca. 12,500 cal. \n\nyears B.P. with an abundant deposition of silt-dominated muds to which sand contributed \n\nwith ca. 10-15%, lasting until ca. 10,000 cal. years B.P. The time interval 10,000-6,500 cal. \n\nyears B.P. was marked by a slight increase of the coarse-grained fraction. Although always in \n\nvestigial amounts, gravel appeared in the record with successive small peaks, whilst sand was \n\npersistently around 20%. Between ca. 6,500 cal. years B.P. and 5,000 cal. years B.P., the \n\ndeposition became again finer due to a small rise in the abundance of both the silt and clay \n\nfractions. The period ranging from ca. 5,000 cal. years B.P. until ca. 2,300 cal. years B.P. set a \n\nreturn to slightly coarser conditions, with gravel increasing and clay contents diminishing. \n\nThis phase terminated with a specific event centred at about 2,400 cal. years B.P. that was \n\ncharacterized by a peak of abundance of the gravel-size fraction (ca. 15% of total sediments), \n\ncorrespondent to the highest gravel content within the entire record. From 2,300 cal. years \n\nB.P. until close to 800 cal. years B.P. gravel contents dropped and silt increased. The time \n\nspanning from ca. 800 cal. years B.P. up to ca. 300 cal. years B.P. witnessed a further increase \n\nof fine sedimentation, in particular of silt, as gravel disappeared completely and sand became \n\nvestigial. At around 300 cal. years B.P., an episode of enhanced clay deposition that reached \n\n\n\n86 \nChapter V. Middle shelf mud body \n\nabout 60% of total sediments marked the transition to the most recent depositional phase. This \n\nlast phase was characterized by persistent very high clay contents, with sediments being \n\nentirely composed of silt and clay until recent times. \n\nThe sequence of vibrocore 14 (Fig. V.6e-f) started with several well pronounced, short-\n\nlived coarser- and finer-alternated depositional cycles that took place between the base of the \n\nvibrocore at around 2,550 cal. years B.P. and ca. 1,950 cal. years B.P. The first cycle \n\npresented more than 50% of gravel content, escorted by small amounts of sand and silt, and \n\nby ca. 20% of clay. At around 2,500 cal. years B.P. a new cycle of reverted tendency was set \n\nwith gravel dropping to nearly 10%, whilst clay and silt increased to almost 40% and to 35%, \n\nrespectively. Another coarse-enhanced depositional cycle occurred at around 2,480 cal. years \n\nB.P., with gravel peaking close to 70% and both silt and clay diminishing to less than half-\n\ncontent. It was succeeded by a longer depositional cycle between ca. 2,450 and 2,320 cal. \n\nyears B.P., which was characterized by gravel content below 20%, increased sand up to ca. \n\n15% and enhanced silt and clay that made up 40% and 35% of the deposits, respectively. At \n\nca. 2,300 cal. years B.P. another important peak of gravel (of ca. 60%) was accompanied by a \n\ngreat decrease of all the other grain-size fractions. From ca. 2,280 cal. years B.P. until ca. \n\n2,050 cal. years B.P. mud sediments dominated deposition with ca. 85%, except for a \n\nlocalized event at 2,150 cal. years B.P. when gravel reached almost 15%. The last significant \n\ngravel contribution within the sequence took place at about 2,000 cal. years B.P. with ca. \n\n35%. At around 1,950 cal. years B.P. an important shift in the depositional pattern was put \n\ninto motion, with the end of the short depositional cycles. A longer depositional phase \n\ncommenced and lasted until ca. 1,100 cal. years B.P., featuring reduced gravel content that \n\nwas always below 15% and gradually decreased together with sand. At the same time, clay \n\ncontinued contributing with ca. 35% while silt progressively increased. From ca. 1,100 cal. \n\nyears B.P. until ca. 500 cal. years B.P. the sedimentation became even finer, with sand \n\ncontents of around 5% and muds composing the remaining ca. 95% of total sediments. The \n\ntime interval of ca. 500-200 cal. years B.P. witnessed the complete disappearance of the \n\ncoarse-fraction and the deposits were fully mud-composed. From ca. 200 cal. years B.P. until \n\nthe top of the record, sand was again present but with just 5-10%. The exception was an event \n\ncentred at ca. 45-25 cal. years B.P., in which sand increased to 15-18%. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n87 \nChapter V. Middle shelf mud body \n\nV.1.3.2. Sand fraction compounds \n\nAll the three sequences of the mud body exhibited specific evolutionary trends concerning \n\ntheir terrigenous and biogenic composition of sand (Fig. V.7). However, the overall \n\ndistribution of compounds along time revealed a generalized domination of terrigenous and an \n\nincrease in the diversity of the bioclasts towards the top of the sequences (Fig. V.7). Within \n\nterrigenous quartz was almost always the most abundant compound, whereas bioclasts were \n\ndominated by molluscs, except the last 7,000 years of vibrocore 1, usually dominated by \n\nbenthic foraminifera (Fig. V.7). \n\n \nFigure V.7 \u2013 Relative abundances (%) of sand compounds and proportion (%) of terrigenous versus biogenic compounds on \nthe mud body: a) and b) vibrocore 1; c) and d) vibrocore 6; e) and f) vibrocore 14.

V.7a-b) started in the late Pleistocene, at ca. 15,500 cal. \n\nyears B.P., with enhanced sandy terrigenous contents of almost 90%, to which quartz \n\ncontributed with 50-65%, being escorted by ca. 15% of other terrigenous (OT) particles and \n\nvestigial mica, whilst molluscs dominated the biogenic compound. The next phase went from \n\nca.  14,800 cal. years B.P. to ca. 13,000-12,900 cal. years B.P. and showed the same \n\nproportion of terrigenous versus biogenic compounds but an accentuated decrease of quartz to \n\nvalues oscillating between 20% and 40%, in favour of enhanced contents of mica (ca. 5-35%) \n\nand particularly of OT (ca. 25-40%). Mollusc shells continued to dominate the biogenic \n\ncompound with ca. 15-20% of total sand. The phase from ca. 13,000-12,900 until 11,800 cal. \n\nyears B.P. was characterized by a shift in the composition of sand, evidenced by an important \n\nincrease of the bioclasts due to higher mollusc content and the appearance of benthic \n\n\n\n88 \nChapter V. Middle shelf mud body \n\nforaminiferal tests that attained ca. 5%. At the same time there was a significant decrease of \n\nthe OT down to ca. 20-25% and of mica down to ca. 5-10%. Between ca. 11,800 and 9,000 \n\ncal. years B.P., roughly coincident with the beginning of the Holocene, mica deposited again \n\nwith up to ca. 15-20% and there was a slight decrease of the biogenic compound, more \n\nnoticeably of the mollusc content. The time interval of ca. 9,000 cal. years B.P. until ca. 7,500 \n\ncal. years B.P. translated an evident change in the characteristics of sand. There was a strong \n\nterrigenous increase driven mainly by higher abundances of OT particles in detriment of \n\nmuch lower abundances of mollusc shells, leading to the almost full domination of the \n\nbiogenic compound by benthic foraminifera. During the period that followed, from ca. 7,500 \n\nuntil 5,700 cal. years B.P., the relative proportions of terrigenous and bioclasts remained \n\nrather constant but there was a significant change within the first, as mica gradually decreased \n\nto about 5%, and quartz and the OT were much enhanced to nearly 50% and more than 20%, \n\nrespectively. A long depositional period succeeded between 5,700 cal. years B.P. and ca. \n\n1,800 cal. years B.P., in which all sand compounds and the terrigenous/biogenic proportions \n\nwere generally maintained, although quartz steadily decreased upwards in detriment of mica \n\nand planktonic foraminifera that made their first appearance and rapidly reached nearly 8%. \n\nAfterwards, the late Holocene was distinguished by some accentuated depositional changes. \n\nThe first significant phase was centred around 1,700 to 1,200 cal. years B.P., with a fast turn \n\nin sedimentation that led to the highest abundance peak (> 60% of total sand) of the biogenic \n\nalong the entire sequence. Both benthic and planktonic foraminifera increased twofold to ca. \n\n30% and 11%, respectively, and molluscs and other bioclasts (OB) tripled up to around 10%. \n\nWithin terrigenous, quartz evidenced the most pronounced drop from ca. 40% to 18%, but OT \n\nparticles were also reduced from ca. 25% to 15%. A depositional episode then occurred \n\naround 1,100 cal. years B.P., with another rise in terrigenous, namely quartz that dominated \n\nsand with ca. 60% and OT. Concurrently, benthic foraminiferal content dropped to half and \n\nall other biogenic compounds practically disappeared. Starting at around 900-800 cal. years \n\nB.P. and until close to present-day, the last depositional phase saw a general increase of all \n\nbiogenic and also of mica, whilst quartz and OT progressively diminished. A specific event \n\ncentred at ca. 180 cal. years B.P. is worth noting, when OT again showed an abundance peak \n\nin detriment of decreased mica and OB, which became almost absent from the record. \n\nThe record of vibrocore 6 (Figs. V.7c-d) showed that from the base of the sequence, at ca. \n\n12,500 cal. years B.P., until around 9,200 cal. years B.P. the sand fraction was clearly \n\ndominated by ca. 80-85% of terrigenous material. Within it, quartz was predominant with \n\nabout 50% of total sand, escorted by an important contribution of OT particles (ca. 20-30%) \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n89 \nChapter V. Middle shelf mud body \n\nand by ca. 2.5-8% of mica. Regarding the biogenic compounds, mollusc shells dominated \n\nthese older deposits. The phase between ca. 9,200 cal. years B.P. and 7,200 cal. years B.P. \n\nwitnessed an increase of the biogenic up to ca. 30%, mainly due to more abundant mollusc \n\ncontents and increasing benthic foraminifera (up to ca. 5%) that were concomitant with a \n\ndecrease in quartz. The period lasting until ca. 5,700 cal. years B.P. was marked by a rise in \n\nterrigenous, with the increase of quartz and OT particles, and reduced biogenic contents that \n\nwere driven mainly by less amounts of mollusc shells. The 5,700-5,500 cal. years B.P. \n\ntimeline then set a definitive turn within the record, with the older sediments being clearly \n\ndominated by terrigenous and sediments deposited after that date becoming gradually \n\nenriched in bioclasts until the top of the sequence. Hence, the period from 5,700 until ca. \n\n2,500-2,200 cal. years B.P. witnessed a gradual and significant increase of the whole biogenic \n\ncompound, particularly of molluscs that composed almost 40% of total sand, and of benthic \n\nforaminifera that doubled to ca. 8%. At the same time, quartz diminished to a minimum of ca. \n\n35% and mica became vestigial. The depositional phase between ca. 2,500-2,200 cal. years \n\nB.P. and 1,100 cal. years B.P. exhibited a moderate but steady trend of increasing and \n\ndiversifying terrigenous, mainly due to an important contribution of aggregates that composed \n\nalmost 15% of sand, in detriment of mollusc content. Although vestigial, it is worth noting \n\nthat mica reappeared in the deposits, escorting the aggregate particles. The last ca. 1,000 years \n\nwere characterized by fast, short-phased oscillations of almost all terrigenous and biogenic \n\ncompounds. Between ca. 1,100 and 600 cal. years B.P. terrigenous peaked out with almost \n\n70% of total sand, as quartz attained ca. 55%. However, aggregates disappeared during this \n\ntime. The following depositional phase, lasting from ca. 600 until 300 cal. years B.P., showed \n\na reverse tendency. Bioclasts made their highest contribution within the record (almost 60%), \n\nwith benthic foraminifera reaching a peak of 14%, molluscs increasing to ca. 25-30% and \n\nother bioclasts (OB) to ca. 9-12%. Within the terrigenous, quartz dropped to ca. 36% and OT \n\nalso decreased. From ca. 300 cal. years B.P. until ca. 100 cal. years B.P. an important \n\ndepositional shift determined the highest abundance of terrigenous compounds in the whole \n\nsequence, which peaked out with 95% of total sand. Amongst terrigenous, quartz contributed \n\nwith 50% and aggregates reappeared with about 5%, whilst the most noticeable features were \n\nan input of mica of ca. 23% and the arise of charcoal particles (ca. 7.5-9.5%) that were present \n\nonly during this period. Contemporaneously, the much reduced biogenic contribution was \n\nlimited to mollusc shells. The last ca. 100 years witnessed a gradual recovery of all biogenic \n\ncompounds, in particular of benthic foraminifera and molluscs (ca. 15-20% and 17.5%, \n\nrespectively), whilst mica returned to abundances below 5%.  \n\n\n\n90 \nChapter V. Middle shelf mud body \n\nThe record of vibrocore 14 (Figs. V.7e-f) began at ca. 2,600 cal. years B.P. and the oldest \n\ndepositional phase lasted from this date until ca. 2,300 cal. years B.P., with terrigenous sand \n\n(ca. 55%) slightly surpassing biogenic sand (c. 45%). It was characterized by high diversity of \n\nterrigenous compounds that were dominated by ca. 40% of quartz and included ca. 2% of \n\nfragments of schist/greywackes (S/G), of sandstones and of aggregates, together with ca. 8% \n\nof OT. Bioclasts were dominated by molluscs that composed ca. 30% of sand, but had also an \n\nimportant contribution of benthic foraminifera with ca. 5-10%. From 2,400 cal. years B.P. \n\nuntil ca. 2,000 cal. years B.P. there was a further enhancement of terrigenous up to 70% of \n\ntotal sand, mainly due to the increase of quartz up to ca. 55% and of OT up to ca. 20%, in \n\ndetriment of reduced mollusc content. However, and despite the abundance rise of carbonate \n\nlithoclasts (CARBLIT) during this time, terrigenous became less diversified as S/G and \n\nsandstones disappeared from the record. Between ca. 2,000 and 1,500 cal. years B.P. bioclasts \n\ngenerally increased to ca. 50% of total sand, mostly driven by increased contents of mollusc \n\nshells. At the same time, there was a significant decrease of OT particles, which dropped from \n\nca. 14% to 6.5%, but S/G contributed again to sedimentation. The short phase lasting from ca. \n\n1,500 cal. years B.P. until 1,300 cal. years B.P. witnessed a further enhancement of bioclasts, \n\nespecially due to an important increase of benthic foraminifera up to 13%. Molluscs also \n\nincreased and planktonic foraminifera, although vestigial (ca. 3%), slightly increased in this \n\nperiod. Terrigenous were reduced to ca. 35% of quartz, 10% of OT and the first contribution \n\nof mica that was nonetheless vestigial. Between ca. 1,300 cal. and 700 cal. years B.P. there \n\nwas a gradual recovery of terrigenous with increased abundances of quartz, mica and OT, \n\nagainst an impoverishment in molluscs and benthic foraminifera. In the period ranging from \n\nca. 700 to 250 cal. years B.P., the composition of sand oscillated several times, chiefly due to \n\nalternated higher and lower quartz abundance in opposition to decreased or increased biogenic \n\ncontribution. Notwithstanding, in general this period was marked by much more abundant \n\nbenthic and planktonic foraminifera (ca. up to almost 30% and 5%, respectively), together \n\nbecoming more abundant than molluscs, and by much lower amounts of OT that accompanied \n\na general decrease in quartz. The last ca. 250 years of deposition featured another increase of \n\nterrigenous up to ca. 65% until the top of the sequence, mostly because of enhanced OT \n\nsupplies. CARBLIT reappeared in very small amounts, and simultaneously mica became \n\nabsent. Within bioclasts, benthic foraminifera were co-dominant with molluscs, escorted by \n\nOB fragments and planktonic foraminifera. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n91 \nChapter V. Middle shelf mud body \n\nV.1.3.3. Quartz shape and surface texture \n\nThe shape and surface texture characterization of sandy quartz was possible only for \n\nvibrocores 6 and 14, because the sand fraction 1-2? in most of the samples from vibrocore 1 \n\ndid not provide the minimum number of quartz grains required for this analysis. The quartz \n\nshape and surface characteristics revealed quite common features and trends at both mid-shelf \n\nsites for most of the studied period (Fig. V.8). Namely, the very similar proportions of high \n\nand low spherical quartz, together with the predominance of rounded forms and smooth-\n\nshinning textures, coupled with an important contribution of not-worn grains (Fig. V.8). \n\nHowever, somewhat distinctive patterns were also observed along the sequences (Fig. V.8). \n\n \nFigure V.8 \u2013 Distribution (%) of sandy quartz grains in relation to: a) and d) sphericity, along vibrocore 6 and vibrocore 14; \nb) and e) roundness, along vibrocore 6 and vibrocore 14; c) and f) surface texture, along vibrocore 6 and vibrocore 14. \nN/D (\u2018no-data\u2019) refers to sections of the sedimentary sequences where the number of quartz grains was insufficient for \ncounting. Legend: SPHER \u2013 high sphericity, N-SPHER \u2013 low sphericity, A \u2013 angular, SUBA \u2013 sub-angular, SUBR \u2013 sub-\nrounded, R \u2013 rounded, WR \u2013 well rounded, NU \u2013 not-worn, EL \u2013 smooth-shining, RM \u2013 rounded-frosted, EL+RM \u2013 mixed \nEL and RM signatures. \n \n\nAlong vibrocore 6 (Figs. V.8a-c), the oldest period (from the base of the sequence at ca. \n\n12,500 cal. years B.P. until ca. 9,200 cal. years B.P.) was characterized by the highest \n\nproportions of angular forms found within the entire record, reaching ca. 55-60% of total \n\nquartz, and concurrently by the highest amounts of not-worn quartz (particularly after ca. \n\n11,800 cal. years B.P.) that reached up to 60% of all the grains. At ca. 9,200 cal. years B.P. \n\nthe quartz characteristics changed rapidly, translated by a great increase of rounded forms and \n\nsmooth-shining grains that became dominant with ca. 80%-90%. After this date and \n\nthroughout early- to late-Holocene until ca. 3,800 cal. years B.P., these characteristics \n\n\n\n92 \nChapter V. Middle shelf mud body \n\nremained rather stable but with a slight gradual increase of all rounded forms (sub-rounded, \n\nrounded and well rounded). Indeed it is worth mentioning the appearance of well rounded \n\n(WR) quartz around 8,400 cal. years B.P. and its steady increase up to almost 15%. Between \n\nca. 3,800 cal. years B.P. and 1,700-1,600 cal. years B.P. there was some increase of not-worn \n\n(NU) quartz that showed a peak of abundance (nearly 20%) around 3,000 cal. years B.P. It \n\nwas coincident with a peak of low sphericity quartz (ca. 60%) that corresponded to the highest \n\ncontribution of this type of grains within the sequence. Around 1,700-1,600 cal. years B.P., at \n\nthe transition to the last and most recent phase, NU quartz exhibited a significant drop down \n\nto ca. 5% that was contemporaneous with the highest amounts of WR grains (ca. 20% of total \n\nquartz). From ca. 1,700-1,600 cal. years B.P. upwards, SUBA and NU quartz gradually \n\nincreased, the latter reaching 25% at around 860 cal. years B.P. From this date onwards and \n\nuntil the top of the sequence, it was not possible to obtain information on sandy quartz due to \n\ninsufficient material for analysis. \n\nAlong vibrocore 14 (Figs. V.8d-f), the first phase lasted from ca. 2,500 cal. years B.P. \n\nuntil ca. 2,200 cal. years B.P. and corresponded to abundance peaks of low sphericity, angular \n\n(A) and NU quartz. The time interval of 2,200-1,200 cal. years B.P. continued with the \n\ndominance of all rounded forms but showing a gradual decreasing trend towards the top, \n\naccompanied by the gradual increase of NU grains in detriment of blunt-shining (EL) quartz. \n\nThe period between ca. 1,200 and 900 cal. years B.P. was marked by an enhancement of all \n\nrounded forms that constituted 70% of total quartz, simultaneously with a small increase of \n\nEL grains. From ca. 900 until 550 cal. years B.P., there was another peak of NU quartz, which \n\nreached ca. 50% and constituted its highest abundance value in the entire record. It was \n\nconcomitant with an enrichment of angular forms that had an identical contribution. For the \n\ntime interval 550-250 cal. years B.P. it was not possible to characterize sandy quartz due to \n\nthe lack of sufficient grains for analysis. From ca. 250 to 80 cal. years B.P., quartz grains \n\nrevealed a dominance of rounded forms with ca. 55%, whilst NU grains slightly decreased but \n\nmaintained high values of ca. 40-45%. The last ca. 80 years of deposition revealed \n\ninsufficient material for analysis. \n\n \n\nV.1.4. Benthic foraminiferal community \n\nV.1.4.1.

Middle shelf mud body \n\nmode clusters along the three mud body vibrocores, are represented in Figures V.9, V.10 and \n\nV.11. In vibrocore 1, core levels 360-362 cm, 350-352 cm, 340-342 cm, 300-302 cm, 260-262 \n\ncm, 250-252 cm, and 230-232 cm did not present the minimum number (300) of foraminiferal \n\nspecimens for counting and identification. The same was verified in vibrocore 6 for core \n\nlevels 19-20 cm and 31-32 cm. These samples were excluded from the statistical analysis. \n\nA total of 21 species with abundance >5% in at least one sample, all calcareous, were \n\nidentified in the three vibrocores. Amongst them, 7 species were present in all vibrocores, \n\nnamely Bolivina ordinaria, Brizalina dilatata, Bulimina marginata, Cassidulina laevigata, \n\nCassidulina minuta, Cribrononion gerthi and Epistominella exigua. With the opposite \n\nbehaviour, eight species were found only in one of the vibrocores (five in vibrocore 1 and \n\nthree in vibrocore 6), namely Bulimina aculeata, Gavelinopsis praegeri, Hyalinea balthica, \n\nNonionella stella, Rectuvigerina phlegeri, Stainforthia fusiformis, Trifarina carinata and \n\nValvulineria bradyana. The remaining six species were present in two of the three vibrocores, \n\nnamely Asterigerinata mamilla, Ammonia beccarii, Bolivina pseudoplicata, Bulimina \n\nelongata, Bolivina striatula and Nonion fabum. R-mode cluster analysis results for all the \n\nmain 21 benthic foraminiferal species of the three sequences are represented in Figure V.12. \n\nVibrocore 1 \n\nThe FD varied between 13 and 6,434 specimens per gram of dry sediment (specimens/g) \n\nwith a clear increasing trend from the base towards the top of the sequence (Fig. V.9). \n\nBetween the base at ca. 15,300 cal. years B.P. and ca. 12,600 cal. years B.P., the FD \n\npersistently exhibited the lowest values, of about 13 to 790 specimens/g. From 1,800-1,700 \n\ncal. years B.P. until close to present-day the values showed great oscillations, with a \n\nmaximum of 6,434 specimens/g at around 1,300 cal. years B.P. Species richness (S) and the \n\ndiversity index Hs showed very similar trends along time (Fig. V.9), their highest values \n\nbeing observed at the base of the core, 78 species and Hs of 3.5, respectively. High variability \n\nof values occurred from ca. 15,200 until 11,500 cal. years B.P., with S between 60 and 43, \n\nand Hs between 2.77 and 3.1. As for evenness (J), it exhibited persistently constant mean \n\nvalues of ca. 0.725-0.813 (Fig. V.9). \n\nA total of 17 main benthic foraminiferal species were identified (Appendix A) and the Q-\n\nmode cluster analysis revealed two main periods correspondent to Clusters I1 and II1, which \n\ngrouped sample levels with different proportions of benthic species (Fig. V.9). \n\n- The period between ca. 15,300 and 8,000-7,800 cal. years B.P. (Cluster I1) was \n\ncharacterized by high abundances (ca. 30%) of B. ordinaria and also by up to 30% of A. \n\n\n\n94 \nChapter V. Middle shelf mud body \n\nmamilla (decreasing values upwards), ca. 20-30% of C. gerthi, and ca. 20% of A. beccarii \n\n(decreasing values upwards), C. laevigata (increasing values upwards) and B. dilatata \n\n(increasing values upwards). They were escorted by much smaller percentages (ca. 5-10%) of \n\nalmost all the other species, except H. balthica, B. marginata and B. striatula that were \n\npractically absent from the record. From ca. 15,300 until 12,600 cal. years B.P., B. ordinaria \n\nand A. mamilla co-dominated (ca. 20% and 30%, respectively) and were accompanied by ca. \n\n10% of B. pseudoplicata and B. elongata, and ca. 5% of G. praegeri, T. carinata, S. \n\nfusiformis, N. stella, E. exigua and C. minuta. From ca. 12,600 until 10,600 cal. years B.P., \n\nthe most abundant species was C. gerthi that increased to ca. 30%, whilst B. ordinaria and A. \n\nmamilla decreased to less than 15%; C. laevigata and B. dilatata gradually increased to ca. \n\n10%, and also C. minuta to more than 5%; at the same time, B. elongata, G. praegeri, T. \n\ncarinata, S. fusiformis and N. stella became practically absent. From ca. 10,600 until 8,000 \n\ncal. years B.P., C. laevigata and B. dilatata further increased to ca. 15% and were co-\n\ndominant with B. ordinaria, whereas C. gerthi, A. beccarii and A. mamilla gradually \n\ndecreased, the latter becoming almost absent. \n\n \nFigure V.9 \u2013 Variation along time of the faunistical density, species richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity index, evenness and \nrelative abundances of the main benthic foraminiferal species (abundance >5% in at least one sample) for vibrocore 1.

Middle shelf mud body \n\nabundances of B. ordinaria (ca. 10-15%). Following these, the most representative species \n\n(with ca. 5-10%) were C. gerthi that decreased towards the top, and E. exigua, H. balthica, C. \n\nminuta, B. marginata and B. striatula that increased towards the top. From ca. 8,000-7,800 \n\nuntil 2,000 cal. years B.P., these abundance values remained rather constant, although C. \n\ngerthi continued to decrease whereas B. marginata and B. striatula gradually increased. From \n\nca. 2,000 cal. years B.P. until the present, these species presented the same mean abundance \n\nvalues but exhibiting more pronounced oscillations. \n\nVibrocore 6 \n\nThe FD varied between 269 and 1,659 specimens/g with the highest values obtained for the \n\nmiddle part of the sequence, between ca. 9,500 and 2,500 cal. years B.P. (Fig. V.10). Species \n\nrichness (S) was more or less constant around 40-50 from the base of the core until ca. 3,500 \n\ncal. years B.P., except for a small peak (54 species) registered at ca. 10,600 cal. years B.P. \n\n(Fig. V.10). At ca. 860 cal. years B.P. the highest S value (63 species) was verified but this \n\ndate simultaneously marked a transition to the period with the lowest S values (38 to 47) of \n\nthe sequence, which lasted until close to present. The diversity index Hs and evenness (J) \n\nshowed low variability throughout most of the sequence, in particular from the core base until \n\nca. 1,000 cal. years B.P. (Fig. V.10). Between ca. 12,200 and 1,000 cal. years B.P. Hs was \n\naround 2.5 to 3 and J was around 0.7 to 0.8. At about 750 cal. years B.P. the lowest diversity \n\nof less than 2.5 and lowest J of ca. 0.66 were verified. Afterwards and until present-day, Hs \n\nslightly increased to around 2.8 and J to around 0.75. \n\nA total of 15 main benthic foraminiferal species were identified (Appendix B) and the Q-\n\nmode cluster analysis revealed two main periods correspondent to Clusters I6 and II6, which \n\ngrouped sample levels with different proportions of benthic species (Fig. V.10). \n\n- The period between ca. 12,500 and 3,000-2,800 cal. years B.P. (Cluster I6) was \n\ncharacterized by high abundances of ca. 25-30% for species B. ordinaria and A. mamilla that \n\nco-dominated the foraminiferal record. Nonion fabum, A. beccarii, R. phlegeri, C. minuta, B. \n\nelongata, B. pseudoplicata, C. gerthi, C. laevigata and B. dilatata were the other most \n\nimportant species with abundance values around 5-10%. From 12,500 until ca. 9,200 cal. \n\nyears B.P., dominant B. ordinaria and A. mamilla were mainly escorted by N. fabum, B. \n\nelongata, B. pseudoplicata and C. gerthi. From ca. 9,200 until 3,000 cal. years B.P., A. \n\nmamilla steadily decreased down to vestigial abundances (ca. 1%) whereas B. elongata and B. \n\npseudoplicata also gradually decreased from ca. 10% to less than ca. 5%. Conversely, A. \n\nbeccarii, R. phlegeri, C. gerthi, C. laevigata and B. dilatata increased from ca. 5% to ca. 10%. \n\n\n\n96 \nChapter V. Middle shelf mud body \n\nV. bradyana, B. aculeata and E. exigua made their first appearance with small but increasing \n\namounts of less than 5%. \n\n \n\nFigure V.10 \u2013 Variation along time of the faunistical density, species richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity index, evenness \nand relative abundances of the main benthic foraminiferal species (abundance >5% in at least one sample) for vibrocore 6. \nQ-mode cluster analysis performed by CONISS with definition of clusters based on the record of relative abundances of the \nbenthic foraminiferal species: the black dashed line separates the two main stratigraphically constrained zones (Clusters I-II) \nalong the vibrocore; the thin punctuated line represents a subdivision within Cluster I6. Thin blanked band on the top of the \nrecord corresponds to levels where no data was obtained due to insufficient specimens for counting. \n \n\n- The period ranging between ca. 3,000-2,800 cal. years B.P. and present-day (Cluster \n\nII6) witnessed even greater abundances of B. ordinaria that dominated the record with 30-\n\n40%. Almost all the other species showed a general increase during this time interval, E. \n\nexigua, B. elongata, C. minuta and B. dilatata particularly after ca. 1,200-1,000 cal. years \n\nB.P., and V. bradyana after ca. 500 cal. years B.P. Asterigerinata mamilla and B. \n\npseudoplicata showed a reverse tendency, becoming practically absent. \n\nVibrocore 14 \n\nThe FD varied between 361 and 7,069 specimens/g and showed the most pronounced \n\nvariation from the core base, around 2,500 cal. years B.P., until ca. 1,400 cal. years B.P. (Fig. \n\nV.11). At the base of the sequence, FD registered a very high abundance of 6,290 specimens \n\nper gram of dry sediment, followed by a drop to ca. 770 specimens/g at around 2,100 cal. \n\nyears B.P. At ca. 1,600 cal. years B.P., FD reached the highest value within the sequence, of \n\nca. 7,069 specimens/g. From ca. 1,500-1,400 until 600 cal. years B.P. the FD was lower with \n\nmean values of ca. 1,900-2,900 specimens/g. The period between ca. 600 and 100 cal. years \n\nB.P. witnessed a further decrease to mean values of 351-858 specimens/g. In the last 100 \n\nyears the FD increased up to ca. 2,835-4,060 specimens/g. Species richness (S) also oscillated \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n97 \nChapter V. Middle shelf mud body \n\nthroughout time, showing a general trend for higher values from the core base until ca. 1,400 \n\ncal. years B.P. (around 50-60 species) and for lower values from this date until the present \n\n(around 40-50 species) (Fig. V.11). The lowest S value of 29 species occurred around 300 cal. \n\nyears B.P. Diversity index Hs and evenness (J) were rather constant and evidenced similar \n\ntrends throughout time (Fig. V.11). Slightly higher values for both Hs and J were obtained \n\nfrom the core base until ca. 1,500 cal. years B.P., of ca. 2.8-3.2 and 0.75, respectively. \n\nBetween this date and modern times values were around 2.5 for Hs and 0.7 for J. \n\n \nFigure V.11 \u2013 Variation along time of the faunistical density, species richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity index, evenness \nand relative abundances of the main benthic foraminiferal species (abundance >5% in at least one sample) for vibrocore 14. \nQ-mode cluster analysis performed by CONISS with definition of clusters based on the record of relative abundances of the \nbenthic foraminiferal species: the black dashed line separates the two main stratigraphically constrained zones (Clusters I-II) \nalong the vibrocore; thin punctuated lines represent subdivisions within the main zones. \n \n\nA total of 9 main benthic foraminiferal species were identified (Appendix C) and the Q-\n\nmode cluster analysis revealed two main periods correspondent to Clusters I14 and II14, \n\nwhich grouped sample levels with different proportions of benthic species (Fig. V.11). \n\n- The period between ca. 2,500 and 600 cal. years B.P. (Cluster I14) was characterized \n\nby the dominance of B.dilatata, C. laevigata and B. ordinaria that presented persistent mean \n\nvalues of about 15% to 25%, followed by C. gerhti with ca. 10%, whereas all the remaining \n\nspecies showed lower abundances of around 5%. From ca. 2,500 until 1,700 cal. years B.P., \n\nB. ordinaria increased and reached a peak of almost 25%, B. striatula oscillated significantly, \n\nN. fabum showed an increasing trend, whereas B. marginata and C. minuta slightly decreased. \n\nFrom ca. 1,700 until close to 600 cal. years B.P., E. exigua was the only decreasing species, \n\nwhilst the others generally increased, in particular B. striatula, C. gerthi and B. marginata.   \n\n\n\n98 \nChapter V. Middle shelf mud body \n\n- The period between ca. 600 cal. years B.P. and the top of the sequence (Cluster II14) \n\ncontinued to present the same general tendencies, but witnessed an important decrease of C. \n\ngerhti and conversely an increase of E. exigua and B. marginata. From ca. 600 until 200 cal. \n\nyears B.P., C. gerthi decreased to less than 5% and B. marginata and C. minuta increased to \n\nca. 10%. From 200 cal. years B.P. until the present, C. laevigata dropped to about 10%, E. \n\nexigua, B. striatula and C. gerthi increased, whilst the opposite trend was observed for B. \n\nmarginata and C. minuta. \n\n \nV.1.4.2. R-mode clustering \n\nThe R-mode cluster analysis performed on the three cores (Fig. V.12) was intended to \n\nevaluate the differences and similarities amongst the evolutionary trends of each individual \n\nspecies along time, thus allowing the identification of different clusters (groups) of species in \n\neach core.  \n\n \n\nFigure V.12 \u2013 Foraminiferal groups produced by R-mode cluster analyses (Ward\u2019s Method) and dendrogram classification \nbased on a total of 21 benthic foraminiferal species with relative abundance >5% in at least one sample of the three \nvibrocores: a) vibrocore 1; b) vibrocore 6; c) vibrocore 14. Clusters A-C correspond to the main groups of species in each \ncore and the dashed line marks the distance that individualized the different groups.  \n \n\nThree main groups were established in vibrocore 1 (Fig. V.12a), two main groups in \n\nvibrocore 6 (Fig. V.12b), and two main groups in vibrocore 14 (Fig. V.12c). The cophenetic \n\ncorrelation obtained for the clustering of the three vibrocores were very high, showing the \n\nstrong inter-relation between the distribution trends of the different species (Fig. V.12). \n\nCorrelation values were ca. 0.86 for vibrocore 1 (Fig. V. 12a), 0.97 for vibrocore 6 (Fig. 12b) \n\nand 0.87 for vibrocore 14 (Fig. 12c). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n99 \nChapter V.

V.9, V.10 and V.11) with the \n\ninformation obtained from the R-mode clustering (Fig. V.12), it was possible to establish the \n\nmain trends of the species distributional patterns along time and in relation to each other (Fig. \n\nV.13). As such, the Q-mode clusters determined along each sequence will be further on \n\ndesignated as \u2018Biofacies\u2019 (Fig. V.13), as they correspond to different benthic environments \n\ninhabited by typical groups of species and thus have specific ecological meaning. \n\nDominant species B. dilatata, C. laevigata and B. ordinaria were grouped together in the \n\nsame R-mode cluster of vibrocores 1 and 14 (Groups A1 and A14) (Figs.

Biofacies II1 characterized \n\nthe record from ca. 8,000-7,800 cal. years B.P. until today, being dominated by species B. \n\nordinaria, B. dilatata and C. laevigata of Group A1, together with an increasing contribution \n\nof species E. exigua, H. balthica, C. minuta, B. marginata and B. striatula of Group C1 that \n\nbecame particularly significant after ca. 3,000-2,000 cal. years B.P. \n\nIn vibrocore 6 (Fig. V.13b), Biofacies I6 characterized the benthic faunas from ca. 12,500 \n\nuntil 3,000-2,800 cal. years B.P., with B. ordinaria dominating the community and A. \n\nmamilla co-dominating until ca. 9,200 cal. years B.P., after which its abundance gradually \n\ndecreased until almost disappearance close to ca. 3,000-2,800 cal. years B.P. Species N. \n\nfabum, A. beccarii, R. phlegeri, C. minuta, B. elongata and B. pseudoplicata of Group A6 \n\nwere also present throughout this biofacies, whilst species of Group B6 became more \n\nimportant after ca. 9,200 cal. years B.P. Biofacies II6 characterized the record after ca. 3,000-\n\n2,800 cal. years B.P. until present-day, being dominated by B. ordinaria and characterized by \n\nspecies E. exigua, V. bradyana, B. marginata and B. aculeata of Group A6 that became more \n\nrepresentative.

Biofacies I14 dominated the \n\nrecord from ca. 2,500 until 600 cal. years B.P. and was characterized by higher abundances of \n\nB. striatula, N. fabum and C. gerthi.

Depositional environments \n\nBased on the features and trends of the key-proxies, four main depositional stages were \n\nidentified for the evolution of this mid-shelf area (Figs. V.14, V.15 and V.16). The first main \n\ndepositional stage (Stage 1), from ca. 15,300 until 12,500-12,000 cal. years B.P., elapsed \n\nduring the late Pleistocene and was registered only in vibrocore 1 (Fig. V.14). The following \n\nmain depositional stage (Stage 2) lasted from ca. 12,500-12,000 until 8,000 cal. years B.P., \n\nincluding a part of the Younger Dryas (ca. 12,900-11,700 cal. years B.P.) and the early phases \n\nof the Holocene (onset at ca. 11,700 cal. years B.P.), whilst Stage 3 covered mainly the mid- \n\nto late-Holocene, spanning from ca. 8,000 until 3,000-2,500 cal. years B.P., both stages being \n\nregistered in vibrocores 1 and 6 (Figs. V.14 and V.15). Finally, the most recent depositional \n\nstage (Stage 4) corresponded to the late Holocene, covering the last ca. 2,500 years, and was \n\nregistered in the three cores (Figs. V.14, V.15 and V.16). \n\nStage 1: from ca. 15,300 until 12,500-12,200 cal. years B.P. \n\nThe first stage was characterized at the site of vibrocore 1 by apparent moderately high \n\nsedimentation rates that ranged from ca. 80 to nearly 50 cm/ka (Fig. V.5a). Sediments were \n\nusually a combination of dominant silt with important but variable contents of sand and a \n\nsignificant clay input, plus a very reduced and intermittent contribution of gravel (Figs. V.6a \n\nand V.14). Within sand, quartz was generally the most abundant compound (Figs. V.7a-b and \n\nV.14). Other terrigenous particles (OT) were almost as abundant as quartz, and mica was also \n\nof some significance, whereas the biogenic compound consisted almost exclusively of \n\nmollusc shells (Figs. V.7a and V.14). In what concerns the benthic foraminiferal community, \n\nthe most evident feature were the very low faunistical densities (FD) that persisted throughout \n\nthis period (Figs. V.9 and V.14). The diversity index Hs was slightly higher and seemed to \n\nexhibit important fluctuations (Figs. V.9 and V.14). This phase was dominated by Biofacies \n\nI1 (Figs. V.13a and V.14).  \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nChapter VI \n \n \nPALEOENVIRONMENTAL EVOLUTION OF THE \nGUADIANA CONTINENTAL SHELF AND \nRECONSTRUCTION OF THE MUD BODY \n  \n\n\n\n154 \nChapter VI. Paleoenvironmental evolution of the Guadiana Continental Shelf \n\nand reconstruction of the mud body \n\nThe multi-proxy study performed in the sedimentary sequences of the Guadiana inner shelf \n\nand mid-shelf mud body allowed an integrated interpretation of the main depositional and \n\nenvironmental events taken place during the last ca 15,300 cal. years B.P., from late \n\nPleistocene and throughout the Holocene until close to present-day. The post-glacial \n\ntransgression that was initiated after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) was recorded at both \n\nshelf domains by a generalized fining-up tendency of sediments (transgressive sequence) and \n\non the middle shelf by a succession of different benthic foraminiferal faunas. Here, this \n\nprocess eventually led to the establishment of the fine to very fine deposits that constitute the \n\nGuadiana mud body. They functioned as a crucial marine archive of the climatic and recent \n\nanthropogenic impacts on the natural systems of the region, and its evolutionary history will \n\nnow be further analysed in the present chapter. \n\nAs was already discussed in the previous chapters, the Guadiana River is the main regional \n\nsource for the sediments that are deposited on the adjacent continental shelf (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., \n\n2004). The estuarine system plays a crucial role in the type and amount of the sedimentary \n\nmaterial that is transferred from the river to the coastal ocean and episodic flood events have \n\nbeen found to be the main mechanism for sediment discharge (fine- and coarse-grained) from \n\nthe river basin onto the shelf (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2004; Portela, 2004; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2007). \n\nThe sediment supply from the basin is however clearly dominated by suspended load \n\nrelative to bed load material (Morales, 1997). Apparently, the estuary retains only a minor \n\nshare (about 10%) of the total amount of fine-grained sediments produced in the drainage \n\nbasin, the rest being transported onto the shelf as part of plumes of riverborne suspended \n\nmaterial that initially deposits at the inner shelf domain (Portela, 2004) (Fig. VI.1). Re-\n\nsuspension and remobilization processes occurring at this energetic area of the shelf are \n\nafterwards responsible for the redistribution of the fine sediments onto the deeper and less \n\nhydrodynamic setting of the middle shelf, where they eventually accumulate (e.g., Gonz\u00e1lez \n\net al., 2004 and 2007). The same mechanism of initial deposition of fluvially-supplied fine \n\nmaterial on shallower shelf areas, followed by post-remobilization and transport onto deeper \n\nmiddle shelf areas where they eventually settle, has been identified in several other \n\ncontinental margins (e.g., Lesueur et al., 1996; Jouanneau et al., 1998, Dias et al., 2002a; \n\nEdwards, 2002; Roussiez et al., 2005; Dubrulle et al., 2007). \n\n \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n \n\n155 \nChapter VI.

These deposits are part of the extensive \n\nhighstand prograding mud facies that covers mid-shelf depths throughout the Gulf of Cadiz \n\nMargin (Guti\u00e9rrez-Mas et al., 1996; Rodero et al., 1999), formed when the Holocene sea-\n\nlevel rise resulted in maximum water depth over the Gibraltar sill and in the full development \n\nof the Atlantic inflow and Mediterranean outflow currents (Nelson et al., 1999).  \n\nOur record from the Guadiana mud body showed though that significant deposition of fine \n\nmaterial started as early as the late Pleistocene, during earlier stages of the Flandrian \n\ntransgression (Fig. VI.2a), when over 60% of silt-dominated muds mixed with sand \n\naccumulated at the deeper and more distal site of vibrocore 1, around 15,000 cal. years B.P. \n\n(Figs. V.4a and V.6a). This tendency persisted throughout the final stages of the Pleistocene \n\nsea-level rise (Fig. VI.2b), and close to the beginning of the Holocene, around 12,000 cal. \n\nyears B.P., mud deposition had already increased up to ca. 80% of total sediments at this site, \n\nwith similar values also being observed for the same period in the shallower mid-shelf \n\nvibrocore 6 (Figs. V.4a-b and V.6a-d). \n\n\n\n156 \nChapter VI. Paleoenvironmental evolution of the Guadiana Continental Shelf \n\nand reconstruction of the mud body \n\nWhen comparing these results with information obtained for shelf mud deposits in other \n\nareas of the Iberian Margin, namely the important Galicia Mud Belt, on NW Iberia, it is clear \n\nthat the evolution of the Guadiana mud body followed a somewhat different pattern. Just as is \n\nverified for the latter, the fine-grained deposits of the Galicia Mud Belt are originated from \n\nregional fluvial input, mainly the discharges of the Douro River (Ara\u00fajo et al., 2002; Portela, \n\n2008), storing ca. 70% of the total detritical fluxes that are transferred from the continent to \n\nthe shelf (Jouanneau et al., 2002). They first settle on the inner shelf but post-remobilization \n\ncaused essentially by winter wave and storm action transports a major part offshore onto the \n\ndeeper middle shelf, which becomes their main depositional site (Dias et al., 2002a and \n\n2002b). Studies focusing on the evolution of the Galicia Mud Belt have however pointed out \n\nthat the first onset of major mud deposition in the area was forced by the last phases of the \n\npostglacial transgression and subsequent sea-level near stabilization (Drago et al., 1999; \n\nLantzsch et al., 2009a, 2009b and 2010). The flooding of the Douro Estuary during the late \n\nPleistocene to early Holocene sea-level rise led first to accumulation of fine sediments inside \n\nthe river valley, whereas the posterior export of terrigenous material to the shelf was initiated \n\nonly during the Holocene, between ca. 8,370 and 5,249 cal. years B.P. (Lantzsch et al., \n\n2009a). It was caused by a shift in the balance between the rate of sea-level rise and the \n\namount of fluvial sediment supply, which provided the prerequisite for initiation and further \n\nexpansion of the mid-shelf mud depocentre, when a transition occurred from pure fine sands \n\ntowards mud contents of more than 25% (Lantzsch et al., 2009a). This contrasts with the \n\nrecord of the Guadiana mud body sequences that, although showing an identical fining-up \n\ntrend forced by postglacial sea-level rise and drowning of the shelf, revealed a much higher \n\ncontent of mud even since before the Holocene times (Figs. V.4a-b and V.6a-d). Although the \n\nGuadiana Estuary was also retaining a significant part of the fluvial sediment-load in the \n\ncourse of its estuarine infilling during the early Holocene sea-level rise (Boski et al., 2002 and \n\n2008), the transfer of sediments seems to have always been significant enough to allow the \n\ndeposition of fine material on the shelf, even at shallower depths than those characterizing the \n\nmodern sites of the studied sequences.  \n\nIt is likely that differences in the regional climate and associated fluvial runoff of the major \n\nrivers supplying both mud depocentres, in the nature of source rocks along the two river \n\nbasins, as well as on the hydrodynamic regime that characterizes each of the shelf systems, \n\nhave all contributed to such diverse evolutional trends of the mud depocentres, and to what \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n \n\n157 \nChapter VI. Paleoenvironmental evolution of the Guadiana Continental Shelf \n\nand reconstruction of the mud body \n\nappears to be the specific case of the Guadiana deposits, characterized by a stronger \n\npredominance of fine sediments at a much earlier stage. \n\nVariations in the lithology of the continental bedrock sources have strong effects on the \n\nsediment composition and grain-size distribution patterns of shelf deposits (e.g., Monteiro et \n\nal., 1982; Dias and Nittrouer, 1984; Paiva et al., 1997; Alves et al., 2003; Machado et al., \n\n2005; Mil-Homens et al., 2006). The outcropping formations along the Douro River Basin, \n\nmainly consisting of plutonic and granitoid rocks, contribute with high amounts of coarser \n\nmaterial to the drainage system, as attested by the volumes of sand that reach and bypass the \n\nDouro Estuary Mouth (Portela, 2008). Conversely, the weathering of the metamorphic schist \n\nand greywacke formations that dominate extensive areas of the Guadiana Basin contributes to \n\nthe much more significant quantities of fine, rather than coarse, material which constitutes the \n\nsediment-load transported by the fluvial system (Morales, 1997; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2004; \n\nPortela, 2004; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2007). Additionally, the influence of fluvial input and of \n\nregional coastal/shelf hydrodynamism has already been indicated as a major factor in \n\ncontrolling the textural composition of shelf sediments along the Portuguese Margin (e.g., \n\nMartins et al., 2012). Precipitation and topography have a strong impact on river flow and \n\ndischarge rates, with rainfall being much heavier in the highlands of northern Iberia than in \n\nthe low lying areas of the southern part of the Peninsula (e.g., Martins et al., 2012). In part \n\nthis probably also explains the coarser nature of riverborne sediments reaching the \n\nnorthwestern shelf, as the transport-capacity of the Douro River is therefore much higher. In \n\nwhat concerns shelf hydrodynamics, whereas the northwestern margin is characterized by \n\nhigh energetic conditions which difficult the setting of muds and allows their re-suspension \n\n(e.g., Lantzsch et al., 2009a; Martins et al., 2012), the southern shelf corresponds to a low \n\nenergy environment that favours the accumulation of the fluvially-derived fine sediments \n\n(e.g., Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2007; Martins et al., 2012).  \n\nBy the time of the early Holocene and after the last global major pulse of sea-level rise \n\nMWP 1B, significant fine sedimentation continued to occur at the two mid-shelf sites in front \n\nof the Guadiana River, and coarse-grained deposits, possibly related with an ancient delta of \n\nthe Guadiana, started to accumulate at the much shallower site of vibrocore 20 (Fig. VI.2b). \n\nThe high amounts of mud mixed with an important contribution of terrigenous sand material \n\n(of ca. 20%) persisted on the mid-shelf deposits throughout most of the Holocene (Figs. V.4a-\n\nb and V.6a-d), whereas on the inner shelf the record of vibrocore 20 showed that coarser \n\nterrigenous sediments dominated deposition closer to the river mouth during all this time. No \n\n\n\n158 \nChapter VI. Paleoenvironmental evolution of the Guadiana Continental Shelf \n\nand reconstruction of the mud body \n\nmajor changes in terms of fine deposition were observed on the mid-shelf sites during this \n\nextended period (Figs. V.4a-b and V.6a-d), not even after sea-level near stabilization at ca. \n\n5,000 cal. years B.P., which seems to indicate that the infilling of the Guadiana Estuary did \n\nnot cause immediate impact on the adjacent middle shelf domain. A significant change was \n\nobserved though on the inner shelf record, with sediments becoming less coarse, as gravel \n\nwas reduced and sand became the main sediment type particularly after the sea level was \n\nalmost stabilized (Fig. IV.4a).  \n\n \nFigure VI.2 \u2013 Evolutional scheme of the Guadiana shelf and of the establishment of the mid-shelf mud body, since the late \nPleistocene sea-level rise (a and b) until the formation of the highstand deposits that translate modern conditions on the shelf \nenvironment (c).

Paleoenvironmental evolution of the Guadiana Continental Shelf \n\nand reconstruction of the mud body \n\nBoth inner and middle shelf sequences also evidenced an apparent lower rate of sediment \n\nsupply during this period, again even after the sea level had approached its present day \n\nposition around mid-Holocene, and the infilling of the Guadiana Estuary was practically \n\ncomplete (Boski et al., 2002 and 2008). It was considered as a possible explanation that \n\nclimate forcing, namely enhanced dryness across the Mediterranean Basin and southern \n\nEurope (e.g., Jalut et al., 2000; Fletcher et al., 2007; Fletcher and Go\u00f1i, 2008; Magny et al., \n\n2009; Carri\u00f3n et al., 2010a; Fletcher et al., 2012), could have contributed to reduced river \n\nflows and consequently to a lessen capacity of sediment-transfer of the Guadiana River. Such \n\na climate scenario would refrain sediment export onto the shelf, specially because soils would \n\nstill be protected from erosional processes by the well developed vegetation cover that had \n\npreviously expanded in the Guadiana Basin under the early Holocene moisture conditions \n\n(e.g., Fletcher et al., 2007), even though the bypass of fluvially-supplied sediments was \n\nprobably favoured by the progressively more stable sea levels and decreased retention of \n\nsediments inside the estuary. At the same time, after the maximum flooding of the Guadiana \n\nEstuary (Morales, 1997; Boski et al., 2002), the prograding phase of the river mouth was put \n\nin motion (Morales, 1997; Lobo et al., 2003; Morales et al., 2006) and probably started to \n\nretain a part of the fluvial-supplied sediments for deltaic construction. This means that the \n\nsupply mechanisms surpassed the distributional processes, which is consistent with the low-\n\nenergy characteristics of the Guadiana margin, and particularly in comparison with the Douro \n\nEstuary case where the higher energetic levels prevented the development of such \n\ndepositional system associated with the river mouth. \n\nBy late Holocene, around 2,000 cal. years B.P., the shelf depositional environment \n\nwitnessed major changes. At the most distal and deeper site of vibrocore 1, fine sedimentation \n\nwas enhanced to more than 90% (Figs. V.4a and V.6a) and apparently much higher amounts \n\nof sediments started to reach the area (Fig. V.14), the same being verified for the inner shelf \n\n(Fig. IV.7). At the same time, fine sediments started to accumulate at the deep site of \n\nvibrocore 14 (Figs. V.4c and V.6e), which seemed to translate the onset of mud deposition in \n\nthis area, westward deviated from the Guadiana River Mouth. It is thus clear that important \n\ntransformations related with the sediment sources were by then taking place, namely along the \n\nGuadiana Basin, increasing significantly both the sediment-load of the river and its transport-\n\ncapacity. The timing of these changes matches well with one of the most crucial historical \n\nperiods of recent times, the expansion of the Roman Empire. Throughout most of Europe and \n\nin particular across the Mediterranean Basin, the Roman rule was responsible for massive \n\n\n\n160 \nChapter VI. Paleoenvironmental evolution of the Guadiana Continental Shelf \n\nand reconstruction of the mud body \n\nhuman development and consequent major impacts on the natural systems, including in \n\nsouthern Iberia and along the Guadiana Basin (e.g., Alarc\u00e3o, 1987; Alarc\u00e3o, 1990; Fabi\u00e3o, \n\n1993). Many palaeoenvironmental studies have already unravelled the effects that land-use \n\nactivities such as intensive agricultural practices, mining exploitation and the constructions of \n\ndams have had in soil erosion and sedimentations patterns, both in continental and in marine \n\nsystems, during the Roman Period (e.g., Zielhofer et al., 2002; D\u00e9sprat et al., 2003; Faust et \n\nal., 2004; Mighall et al., 2006; Carri\u00f3n et al., 2007; Casana, 2008; Gil-Romera et al., 2010; \n\nAnderson et al., 2011; Kaal et al., 2011; Delgado et al., 2012). Furthermore, it has been \n\nproposed that this period also corresponded to a time of enhanced humidity across the \n\nMediterranean, amplifying the human-induced erosional processes (e.g., D\u00e9sprat et al., 2003; \n\nThorndycraft and Benito, 2006; Bern\u00e1rdez et al., 2008; Casana, 2008; Mart\u00edn-Puertas et al., \n\n2009; Mohamed et al., 2010; Dermody et al., 2012; Corella et al., 2013). As such, it is likely \n\nthat the changes detected in the shelf depositional patterns at this time, with enhanced \n\nsediment-supply and higher amounts of fine-grained material reaching the mid-shelf, were \n\nmainly driven by human forcing but further enhanced by a climate shift towards more \n\nhumidity and higher river-runoff. It determined an even more pronounced fining-up trend \n\nwithin the mud body depocentre and the onset of mud deposition in a location deviated from \n\nthe main sediment-pathway of the Guadiana Mouth, marking a clear expansion of the mud \n\nbody beyond its depocentre, as had been previously observed (Rosa et al., 2011), and clearly \n\nsetting new conditions on the shelf (Fig. VI.2c). A very similar process of mud-enhancement \n\non the shelf domain due to the coupling of climatic changes and strong human impact during \n\nRoman times has also been recognized on the Northern Aquitaine shelf (Lesueur et al., 1996; \n\n2001 and 2002). Major changes on erosional processes along the catchment areas of the \n\nGironde and Loire rivers, the main regional sediment-suppliers to the shelf, were detected \n\nsince ca. 2,000 cal. years B.P. and modified drastically the shelf depositional patterns by \n\nintroducing large amounts of fine-grained material onto the system, which led to the final \n\nestablishment and expansion of the Gironde and \u2018La Grande Vasi\u00e8re\u2019 mud fields on the \n\nmiddle shelf. \n\nAfter ca. 1,000 cal. years B.P., another high input of fine material started to reach the shelf, \n\ndetermining almost fully mud deposition at the mud body sites of vibrocores 6 and 14 (Figs. \n\nV.4a, V.4c, V.6c and V.6e), as well as the preservation of important mud layers at the inner \n\nshelf site (Figs. IV.2 and IV.4a). Again, anthropogenic causes seemed to be behind this \n\nevolutionary trend, as it was contemporaneous with another phase of notable human \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n \n\n161 \nChapter VI. Paleoenvironmental evolution of the Guadiana Continental Shelf \n\nand reconstruction of the mud body \n\ndevelopment in southern Iberia, the Islamic Medieval Period (e.g., Ribeiro, 1987). During the \n\nMuslim rule, and particularly after the 8th century A.D. (ca. 1,350 cal. years B.P.), there was \n\nan unprecedent population growth (e.g., Oliveira Marques, 1993; Boone and Worman, 2007) \n\nand the exceptional conditions of the region for agriculture were largely maximized (e.g., \n\nDevy-Vareta, 1985; Ribeiro, 1987; Magalh\u00e3es, 2002; Gamito, 2007; Borges Coelho, 2008). \n\nThis eventually had consequences on erosion, which is likely to have become more severe, \n\nleading to enhanced sediment-load being transported by the river and transferred onto the \n\nshelf. Furthermore, the evolution of the Guadiana River Mouth itself, including the narrowing \n\nof its eastern margin tidal inlets (Morales, 1997), was most certainly further contributing for \n\nthe observed patterns of deposition on the shelf and within the mud body. As was already \n\ndiscussed in the previous chapter, the intensification of erosion processes due to human land-\n\nuse was probably one of the main reasons that led to the silting-up of the Guadiana eastern \n\ndistributary. Consequently, there was a reinforcement of the western distributary and a \n\ncontinuous deviation of most of the river sediment-load towards what is today the main \n\nchannel of the estuary, which became the chief transfer-pathway between the estuarine system \n\nand the shelf, discharging directly onto the area where the cores were located. This was \n\nprobably the main mechanism that changed once more the depositional patterns in the mid-\n\nshelf, and contributed to the full establishment of the mud body deposits at their present-day \n\nposition (Fig. VI.2c). It is interesting to notice that identical evolutional trends were again \n\nunravelled for the Northern Aquitaine shelf (Lesueur et al., 1996; 2001 and 2002), where \n\nsignificant morphological changes of the Gironde River Mouth partially driven by the \n\ninfluence of human activity were responsible for controlling the further increase of supply of \n\nsuspended sediment to the shelf after ca. 1,000 cal. years B.P. These authors concluded that \n\nthe bulk of the mud accumulated on the Aquitaine mid-shelf over the last two millennia and \n\nan important part of the fine-grained sedimentation has occurred since Medieval Age, with the \n\nGironde shelf mud fields corresponding to the final phase of a highstand deposit sequence. \n\nThe fine deposits today forming the Guadiana mud body can thus be interpreted in terms of \n\ntheir genesis and general configuration according to the schematic model proposed by \n\nLantzsch et al. (2009a) (Fig. VI.3), as belonging to type 2a. \n\n \n\n\n\n162 \nChapter VI.

White arrows indicate sediment input and transport, grey arrows the strength of the hydrodynamic regime on the \ninner, middle and outer shelf. \n \n\nIn general terms, their formation has been mainly controlled by the moderate sediment \n\nsupplies of the Guadiana River and the hydrodynamic regime across the shelf, which \n\ndetermines re-suspension of the fine sediments from the more energetic coastal and inner \n\nshelf domain, and its transport offshore where they eventually settle and accumulate at the \n\nless hydrodynamic environment of the middle shelf, detached from their main sediment \n\nsource (Fig. VI.3). \n\nOn the mid-shelf these deposits have formed the Guadiana mud body, which constitutes an \n\nimportant regional fine-grained deposit that started to build-up as early as the late Pleistocene \n\nsea-level rise. However, it only developed into an almost fully mud deposit during the last \n\nphases of the Holocene highstand, forced by the conjoint action of recent climatic events and \n\nthe intensive human occupation of the region that has transformed irreversibly the Guadiana \n\nBasin landscapes since Roman and Islamic times, until present-day. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nChapter VII \n \n \nMAIN FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS \n  \n\n\n\n164 \nChapter VII. Main findings and conclusions \n\nMain findings: depositional stages and shelf evolution \n\nThe multi-proxy sedimentological and micropaleontological study conducted in the four \n\nsequences retrieved from the Guadiana inner- to mid-shelf unravelled a succession of \n\ndifferent depositional environments for the period spanning from late Pleistocene (for the \n\nrecord of the middle shelf mud body) and from early Holocene (for the record of the inner \n\nshelf), until close to present-day. These paleoenvironments were established across the shelf \n\nas a response to global and regional forcing mechanisms, namely climate change, the \n\npostglacial sea-level rise and the more recent impact of human development. Their \n\nreconstruction allowed to rebuild the evolutionary history of the Guadiana region throughout \n\nthe analysed period, and to assess the role of the interplay between climatic and \n\nanthropogenic forces in shaping the natural systems. Furthermore, the insight on the evolution \n\nof the Guadiana mid-shelf mud body as a specific depositional and ecological domain is \n\npresented in detail for the first time and enabled a higher-resolution interpretation of the \n\nevents occurred at a millennial- to centennial-scale, including those that took place during \n\nHistorical times. \n\nOn the inner shelf location of vibrocore 20, four main depositional stages were identified \n\nthroughout the last ca. 9,200 years, evolving from a proximal setting that was probably part of \n\nthe submerged deltaic system associated with the Guadiana River mouth into a shallow inner \n\nshelf domain. On the mid-shelf mud body, four depositional stages were recognized since the \n\nlate Pleistocene from ca. 15,300 cal. years B.P. The different ages obtained for the three \n\nanalysed sequences implied that the four depositional stages could only be identified in the \n\nolder record of vibrocore 1, whereas the younger vibrocores 6 and 14 did not register all \n\nstages. The deeper vibrocore 1 and the shallower vibrocore 6, both located in front of the \n\nGuadiana River mouth and on the modern depocentre of the mud body, evolved from a \n\nshallow inner shelf setting towards a mud-dominated middle shelf environment, following a \n\ndiachronic process due to their differences in water depth. The site of vibrocore 14, situated at \n\nan intermediate depth between vibrocores 1 and 6 but deviated to the west of the main \n\nsediment source, the Guadiana River, registered only the last ca. 2,000 years and translated \n\nthe more recent expansion of the mud body towards other areas outside its depocentre. All \n\nshelf sequences revealed a clear fining-up trend of sediments, corresponding to a \n\ntransgressive record associated with the global postglacial rise of the mean sea level, which \n\nwas almost fully stabilized in the region around 5,500 cal. years B.P. \n\n \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n \n\n165 \nChapter VII. Main findings and conclusions \n\nMud body first depositional stage \n\nThe oldest sediments correspond to the mud body first depositional stage (ca. 15,300 to \n\n12,500-12,200 cal. years B.P.) and constitute transgressive deposits registered only at the \n\nmore distal site (vibrocore 1) in a context of lowstand, but already forced by fast sea-level \n\nrising. Deposition occurred in a much shallower environment than today, probably in a \n\nproximal, more energetic, inner shelf domain standing at ca. 10-15 m below water depth. \n\nSediments corresponded to a combination of dominant silt with alternating amounts of clay \n\nand sand that translate pulses of sea-level rise at different rates, together with significant \n\ncontinental-derived terrigenous material that reflected the proximity to the Guadiana bed-load \n\ndischarges. The benthic foraminiferal species clearly confirmed this environmental scenario. \n\nThey were dominated by typical coastal taxa, such as Asterigerinata mamilla, Cribrononion \n\ngerthi, Gavelinopsis praegeri and Bulimina elongata, whereas the very low faunistical \n\ndensities pointed to some degree of ecological instability due to the higher impact of coastal \n\ncurrents and fast changing conditions arising from the fast sea-level rise. By the time of the \n\nYounger Dryas (ca. 12,900-11,700 cal. years B.P.), the sea had already rise several meters \n\nand the site of vibrocore 1 would have been in a deeper marine setting (ca. 30-50 m water \n\ndepth), approximately in the transition from the inner to the middle shelf. \n\nSecond mud body and first inner shelf depositional stages \n\nThe second depositional stage registered on the mud body, from ca. 12,500-12,200 until \n\n8,000 cal. years B.P., corresponds to the final part of the Younger Dryas (YD) and to the early \n\nHolocene, and was recorded at the two mid-shelf sites of vibrocores 1 and 6. At the beginning \n\nof this stage, the sea had already drowned a significant part of the shelf, placing the location \n\nof vibrocore 1 probably at ca. 60 m water depth and of vibrocore 6 around 10 m water depth. \n\nWith the mean sea level continuing to rise and accelerating at the beginning of the Holocene, \n\nthere was a further deepening of the shelf environments during this time. This acceleration \n\nwas probably the cause for the apparently low sedimentation rates registered at both sites, as it \n\ncontinued to promote the Guadiana Estuary fast infilling and retention of fluvial sediments. \n\nThe two locations evidenced evolutionary trends that translate their further transition into \n\ndeeper conditions, characterized by the continuous deposition of high amounts of fine \n\nmaterial that corresponded to the setting of the mud body on the middle shelf. However, they \n\nexhibited different sedimentary and ecological features that are consistent with their location \n\nat different water depths and distance to the river mouth, with the site of vibrocore 1 reaching \n\nnear 75-85 m water depth and vibrocore 6 around 25-35 m water depth. The most evident \n\n\n\n166 \nChapter VII. Main findings and conclusions \n\nchanges were observed within the benthic foraminiferal communities, as the species typical of \n\nmore energetic shallow environments still dominated the site of vibrocore 6, but were \n\ngradually replaced in the deeper site of vibrocore 1 by opportunistic species with preference \n\nfor finer sediments and lower energetic conditions, namely Bolivina ordinaria, Cassidulina \n\nlaevigata and Brizalina dilatata. \n\nDuring this time-interval, the first depositional stage of the inner shelf was identified \n\nbetween ca. 9,200 and 8,500-8,200 cal. years B.P. The sand and gravel composition of \n\nsediments, together with the morphoscopy and shape of sandy quartz, revealed a strong \n\nsignature of the Guadiana direct bed-load input with the significant presence of fluvially-\n\nderived feldspars and Paleozoic schists/greywacke, and poorly reworked quartz grains, which \n\ntoday can only be found in the proximal area of the river mouth. By early Holocene, this site \n\nwould stand in a shallower and more proximal environment that was probably part of the \n\nsubmerged detritic delta just off the river mouth. \n\nThird mud body, second and third inner shelf depositional stages \n\nThe first phase of the mud body third depositional stage (ca. 8,000 to 6,000-5,800 cal. \n\nyears B.P.) correspond to the time when the sea was evolving to near stabilization, at around \n\n5,500 cal. years B.P. Both mid-shelf sites were approaching water depths similar to the \n\npresent ones, already in a fully marine shelf environment, and this process was again better \n\nevidenced by the benthic foraminiferal faunas. Although revealing quite diverse trends at each \n\nsite as a differentiated bathymetric response to evolving water depths and distance to the river \n\nmouth, the increased faunistical densities and rather constant diversity values highlight the \n\nestablishment of more stable ecological conditions in a eutrophic deeper environment, \n\ncontinuously favoured by the high influx of fluvially-supplied nutrients. On the other hand, \n\nthe Guadiana Estuary was by then reaching an advanced state of infilling but no increased \n\nsediment bypass towards this area seems to have occurred, the same being detected for the \n\ninner shelf site. Here, the evolutional patterns during this time-interval, which corresponds to \n\nits second depositional stage, also revealed the crucial influence of the Holocene sea-level \n\nrise. Until close to 5,800 cal. years B.P., the environment gradually shifted from a \n\ntransitional/coastal setting to a clear inner shelf domain, as is attested by the increase of \n\nmarine-derived biogenic compounds and of better reworked (blunt-shining) quartz, and by the \n\ndecrease of the fluvial-originated bed-load compounds. These were used as proxies for \n\nincreased water depth and distance to the river mouth, which led to an enhancement of marine \n\nprocesses in the area over the continental-derived imprint. Moreover, they seem to attest for \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n \n\n167 \nChapter VII. Main findings and conclusions \n\nthe existence of a warmer and moisture climate, which had been previously identified in the \n\nregion during early Holocene times and that offered soil protection to erosion due to \n\nvegetation cover expansion along the Guadiana Basin, thus contributing to reduce sediment-\n\ninput from the river to the shelf. \n\nDuring the second phase of the middle shelf third depositional stage, until ca. 2,500-2,000 \n\ncal. years B.P., the sedimentological patterns remained very similar but with a persistent \n\nsediment fining-up trend, which further evidenced the growing stability of this mid-shelf area \n\nunder the continuous influence of the Guadiana suspended-load supplies. However, a shift in \n\nthe benthic foraminiferal communities of vibrocore 1 seemed to indicate less changeable \n\necological conditions, as there was a decrease of the highly opportunistic C. laevigata and B. \n\ndilatata in favour of other species, like Hyalinea balthica, Bulimina marginata and Bolivina \n\nstriatula. These are also related to fine-grained bottom-sediments, in intermediate to deep \n\nenvironments with high primary productivity, and usually occupy the same ecological niches \n\nas C. laevigata and B. dilatata, but do not exhibit the same opportunistic behaviour. Such \n\ntrend was interpreted as the response to a decreasing impact of more direct and excessive \n\nnutrient supplies from the river that resulted from a combination of two major forcing factors, \n\nnamely the post-transgression evolution of the Guadiana Estuary mouth and changes in \n\nregional climate towards increased aridity. Consistently, on the inner shelf location, the third \n\ndepositional stage that lasted from ca. 5,800 until around 2,000 cal. years B.P. witnessed a \n\nfurther increase of the marine signature of the deposits, coupled with indicators of continuous, \n\nbut reduced, river sediment-supply, despite the almost completion of the Guadiana Estuary \n\ninfilling that was expected to have reversed such trend. This was attributed to the combined \n\naction of the two previously mentioned main factors. The prograding processes occurring on \n\nboth margins of the estuary and the construction of the fluvial deltaic system led to sediment \n\nimprisonment on the terminal part of the estuary, whereas the increased aridity that is \n\nrecognized for the Guadiana River Valley during this period, although also impacting on the \n\nvegetation cover and soil erosion rates, must have reduced river-activity. Together, both \n\nmechanisms seem to have been responsible for a diminished fluvial input of sediments and \n\nnutrients onto the adjacent shelf.  \n\nFourth mud body and inner shelf depositional stages \n\nThe onset of the fourth depositional stage took place at around the same approximate dates \n\non the inner and middle shelf, at around 2,000 cal. years B.P., and was marked by much \n\nenhanced sediment supply onto both shelf areas. \n\n\n\n168 \nChapter VII. Main findings and conclusions \n\nOn the middle shelf sequences of vibrocores 1 and 6, it corresponded mainly to fine-\n\ngrained material, accompanied by important changes in the sand fraction compounds. Also, \n\nthe increase of specific benthic foraminiferal species and the appearance of other, namely \n\nBulimina aculeata, B. marginata, H. balthica, Rectuvigerina phlegeri, B. striatula and, in \n\nparticular, Epistominella exigua, represented a definitive turn-over of the ecological niches \n\nwithin the mud body. At the same time, high amounts of fine sediments started to accumulate \n\nat the site of vibrocore 14, initiating the mud body record in this location of the middle shelf. \n\nOn the inner shelf, the increased amount of sediments reaching the site was also followed by \n\nthe first major deposition of muds at ca. 1,000 cal. years B.P., generating a record of \n\nalternating sand-dominated and fine-dominated deposits that were interpreted as phases of \n\ndryer climate and reduced floods, and phases of wetter climate and enhanced flood-events, \n\nrespectively. \n\nThe onset of these changes was probably the consequence of the first major impact of \n\nanthropogenic activities along the Guadiana River Basin, related with the Roman occupation \n\nof Iberia and a possible wetter phase in the region. The strong human-forced soil erosion due \n\nto new agricultural practices and widespread wood exploitation for construction, domestic use \n\nand mining activities, eventually associated with higher precipitation and river runoff, \n\nincreased sediment load and seemed to have caused major modifications on the shelf \n\ndepositional environment, leading also to the final phase of fining-trend in the mid-shelf mud \n\ndeposits. Furthermore, the coupled human-climate forcing upon the river export capacity \n\nprobably enhanced progradation at the estuary mouth, leading to the silting-up process of an \n\nancient eastern distributary of the estuary, and the reinforcement of the western main \n\nestuarine channel that discharges directly onto this area of the shelf. After ca. 1,500 cal. years \n\nB.P., a higher impact of bed-load fluvial discharges was regarded as an even stronger human \n\nimpact in the landscape of the Guadiana region, associated with the Islamic Rule of southern \n\nIberia. The further human-induced increase of the river sediment-load might have also been \n\nthe main cause for the definitive colmatation of the Guadiana eastern distributary, and final \n\nreinforcement of the transfer-capacity of the main western channel. This time-interval, until \n\nca. 800 cal. years B.P., has been identified as a more severe dry period in southern Europe, \n\nlargely forced by the effects of the atmospheric NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation) system and \n\nspecifically by a more persistent positive signal of its index, which means river-activity must \n\nhave been reduced. However, on the inner shelf, the occurrence of an initial wetter phase was \n\nnot recorded, as the absence of flood-like mud deposits until ca. 850 cal. years B.P. seemed to \n\nsuggest a persistent dry climate, or at least that the moisture conditions were not strong \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n \n\n169 \nChapter VII. Main findings and conclusions \n\nenough to generate a significant deposition of fine material in this shallower location, and its \n\npreservation as flood-layers. \n\nThe general enhanced aridity seems to have persisted until close to ca. 300 cal. years B.P., \n\nwith human impacts during the Middle Ages probably continuing to be the main forcing \n\nfactor behind the persistent high amounts of sediments that reached the shelf, almost fully \n\nsuspended-load in the case of the middle shelf area. Here, this process contributed to the \n\nfurther development of the mud body depositional system, and to ecological conditions that \n\ncontinued to favour opportunistic benthic foraminiferal species under high nutrient inputs \n\nfrom the Guadiana River. On the inner shelf site, there was however a signal for enhanced \n\nriver runoff between ca. 850 and 600 cal. years B.P., translated by the first significant input of \n\nfine material to the site, mostly silt. It could be a record of higher precipitation and occurrence \n\nof floods due to a shorter wetter period in the region, perhaps linked to a fluctuation of the \n\nNAO index towards negative values. Afterwards and until close to 350 cal. years B.P., the \n\ndecline of fines signalizes the reduction of flood-impact events on the inner shelf, in the \n\nalready mentioned context of a dry climate, possibly modulated in part by a phase of more \n\npersistent NAO-positive values. \n\nThe last ca. 300 years of deposition in the mud body continued to be strongly dominated \n\nby fluvially-supplied fine sediments and indicated a clear enhancement of the Guadiana River \n\nrunoff, with a specific sedimentological imprint of continental-derived terrigenous that \n\nreflected an even more intensive coupling of anthropogenic and climate forcing mechanisms. \n\nMoreover, the accumulation of abundant charcoal particles registered around 100 cal. years \n\nB.P. that were probably originated in the mining activities along the Guadiana Basin, seem to \n\ncorrespond to the depositional imprint on the shelf of major floods that were described for the \n\nGuadiana River within this time-interval, such as the one recorded in 1876 A.D. New \n\necological niches were also established within the mud body that translate these changes in \n\nfluvial-supply, with species that profit from very abundant nutrient input clearly increasing, \n\nsuch as E. exigua and Valvulineria bradyana, both emerging as characteristic species of this \n\nperiod. The long-term human occupation and transformation of the region since as early as ca. \n\n2,500-2,000 cal. years B.P. was indeed accentuated after the 19th century by strong-impact \n\nactivities such as intensive mining exploitation and agricultural practices, which led to an \n\neven greater exposure of soils to erosion. Simultaneously, this time corresponds to the most \n\npronounced phase of the LIA (Little Ice Age), clearly associated with a persistent negative-\n\nlike mode of the NAO index that is the main responsible for increased moisture and winter \n\nprecipitation in SW Iberia. This is in accordance with what was detected for the inner shelf \n\n\n\n170 \nChapter VII. Main findings and conclusions \n\nduring this period, where the last ca. 350 years witnessed a strong return to enhanced fine \n\ndeposition that clearly revealed higher precipitation levels and the establishment of a wetter \n\nclimate in the region.  \n\nCoupled with the stronger human-induced erosion along the river basin, the climate-driven \n\nincreased runoff hence seems to have been the main responsible for the significant \n\nenhancement of the Guadiana River export capacity of sediments and nutrients from the \n\ncontinent to the shelf, and to the new depositional patterns established both on the inner shelf \n\nand in the mid-shelf mud body. \n\n \n\nFinal remarks \n\nThe depositional patterns of the inner shelf site throughout the Holocene were closely \n\nassociated with the inputs from the Guadiana River and the geomorphologic evolution of its \n\nestuarine system, coupled with a strong imprint of the longshore drift supplies. The coarse and \n\nvery coarse terrigenous-dominated material that constitute much of the older deposits until \n\nclose to 3,500 cal. years B.P. revealed the importance of early- to mid-Holocene sea-level \n\nvariations and the retention of sediments inside the Guadiana Estuary during its infilling. \n\nSuperimposed on this fluvial-forced variability, the dominance of well-reworked (spherical, \n\nrounded and blunt-shinning) quartz within sand attests the continued importance of coastal \n\nprocesses at this site throughout time. On the mid-shelf mud body, depositional patterns also \n\nreveal that the evolution of this area was closely tied to the sediment supplies of the Guadiana \n\nRiver, since as early as the late Pleistocene. The impact of the postglacial sea-level rise that \n\ncharacterized the early Pleistocene and the beginning of the Holocene overruled other forcing \n\nmechanisms during the first depositional stages of the mud body, as it submerged large areas \n\nof the shelf. Simultaneously, it controlled the infilling of the Guadiana Estuary, with \n\nconsequences for the type and amount of sediments that were transferred from the river basin \n\nonto the adjacent shelf. After the near stabilization of the mean sea level and with the \n\nestuarine infilling almost complete around mid-Holocene, sediment retention seems to have \n\nfurther continued until late Holocene due the prograding processes that began in the Guadiana \n\nRiver Mouth, but other global and regional factors became determinant in the control of \n\nsediment supply to the shelf system, namely the millennial- to centennial-scale North Atlantic \n\nclimatic oscillations, and the more recent impact of human development in the region. \n\nFurther work needs however to be conducted in order to clarify some issues that require a \n\nbetter understanding, namely: the integration of all the data based on the analysis of the cores \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n \n\n171 \nChapter VII.

Systematic \n\nThe systematic taxonomy of benthic foraminifera from the Guadiana mud body is presented in \n\nthis chapter for all the species that were found with at least two specimens in at least one of all \n\nthe analysed samples (Appendixes A, B and C). \n\nIn the current study, the commonly accepted systematic hierarchy established by Loeblich and \n\nTappan (1988) was followed, placing foraminifers in the Order Foraminiferida (Eichwald, 1930). \n\nFollowing the 1960\u2019s publications from the same authors, most of systematisits have accordingly \n\nclassified foraminifers as belonging to the Kingdom Protista, more recently also designated as \n\nKingdom Protoctista, which englobes eukaryotic unicellular organisms. The taxonomic rank of \n\nforaminifera was raised from order to class also by Loeblich and Tappan (1992) according to the \n\ncharacteristics of the organisms, organized as follows: 1) granuloreticulose pseudopodia; 2) outer \n\ncover, usually a test; 3) alternation of haploid and diploid generations; 4) the presence of a test \n\nconstructed from non-oriented calcareous or siliceous crystals. \n\nThe classification of the foraminifers\u2019 genera and all their successive higher classes \n\n(subfamilies, families, superfamilies and suborders) established in the present study was based on \n\nthe work by Loeblich and Tappan (1988), except for the genera Textularia and species Discorbis \n\nwilliamsoni that were kept with the original names taken from the Ellis and Messina catalogue of \n\nForaminifera (1942-2009). For each identified species, the taxonomic references were organized \n\naccording to the following schematics: 1) the name of the species as was used in the present \n\nwork, together with the name of the author and the date of its first identification; 2) the plate and \n\nfigure numbers for the species that were photographed with the scanning electron microscope \n\n(SEM), which included all the main species (> 5% abundance in at least one sample) and several \n\nother whenever it was possible to obtain their photographic record; 3) the original generic \n\nclassification and species name obtained with the Ellis and Messina catalogue of Foraminifera \n\n(1942-2009); 4) a synonymy list, whenever existing; 5) examples obtained from the literature \n\n(e.g., Murray, 1971; Colom, 1974; Boltovskoy et al., 1980; Jones, 1994; Levy et al., 1995; \n\nDebenay et al., 2001; Murray, 2003; Martins and Gomes, 2004; Mendes et al., 2004; Milker and \n\nSchmiedl, 2012; Holbourn et al., 2013). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n\u2018Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River\u2019 \n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n175 \nChapter VIII.
