In Belarus I concentrated on ecological \n\ntourism in our protected areas gradually turning from the \u2018tourism manager\u2019 view on it to \n\n\u2018nature conservationist\u2019 one. The Master programme helped me to get a broader view on \n\nsustainable management concept. \n\nThis thesis is a result of the author\u2019s continuous work and dedication which, however, could \n\nnot be possible without support and contribution of many people. \n\nFirst, I would like to thank my family and friends for their understanding, support and advice \n\nduring all this time: my parents Sviatlana and Anatolij, my sister Kaciaryna and my Vova.  \n\nTo my supervisor and course director professor Carla Maria Rolo Antunes who helped me to \n\norganize and present all the collected information properly and gave her useful advice at the \n\ndifferent stages of the working process.  \n\nTo Maryna Barouka, my professor at the Belarusian State University, for her guidance in \n\nmethodological and organizational issues. \n\nTo the employees of the research sites who gave me a warm welcome and provided with the \n\nnecessary information: Fernando Jos\u00e9 Velez Serr\u00e3o de Faria Pereira, Luis Leit\u00e3o, Ant\u00f3nio \n\nFigueiredo, Jo\u00e3o Branco, Teresa Lemos, Vadzim Protasevich, Ivan Borok.  \n\nTo Uladzimir Malashevich, director of APB-Birdlife Belarus NGO, who supported my \n\nresearch and provided me with valuable information and professional comments.  \n\nTo Bruno Herlandes who gave me the possibility to participate in LIFE+Trachemys project.  \n\nTo my professors of Portuguese for their efficient teaching methods which helped me to study \n\na great amount of material in Portuguese: Maria Isabel Rosa Barriga Dias, Cristina Pereira. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n4 \n\nRESUMO  \n\n \n\nO presente estudo incide na an\u00e1lise comparativa das zonas h\u00famidas de \u00e1gua doce em dois \n\npa\u00edses - Belarus (pa\u00eds de origem do autor) e Portugal (pa\u00eds onde o autor frequentou o curso de \n\nMestrado), nomeadamente para determinar as semelhan\u00e7as e diferen\u00e7as nas abordagens de \n\nconserva\u00e7\u00e3o de zonas h\u00famidas e pr\u00e1ticas seguidas nos referidos pa\u00edses e identificar os \n\naspectos positivos e experi\u00eancias que pudessem ser utilizadas no futuro. Foram seleccionadas \n\n7 \u00e1reas de estudo \u2013 3 turfeiras em Belarus e 4 zonas em Portugal (3 pauis e 1 turfeira).  \n\nA pesquisa centrou-se nos aspectos da conserva\u00e7\u00e3o da natureza, uso atual de recursos de \n\nzonas h\u00famidas e as perspectivas futuras de uso e conserva\u00e7\u00e3o. Tamb\u00e9m foram realizados \n\ninqu\u00e9ritos, com o objectivo de avaliar o comportamento dos turistas quando visitam esta \n\ntipologia de espa\u00e7o. Neste enquadramento, em ambos os pa\u00edses, o autor participou em dois \n\nprojetos de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o de zonas h\u00famidas.  \n\nO trabalho tem a seguinte estrutura: 1 Introdu\u00e7\u00e3o do estudo, onde s\u00e3o indicados os objetivos, \n\na estrutura e a metodologia; 2 Estado da arte relativamente \u00e0 vis\u00e3o das zonas h\u00famidas de \u00e1gua \n\ndoce de Belarus e de Portugal e as respectivas experi\u00eancias de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o; 3 Casos de \n\nestudo, onde s\u00e3o apresentadas as sete \u00e1reas de estudo e os dois projetos de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nzonas h\u00famidas; 4 Resultados \u2013 an\u00e1lise comparativa do desempenho das \u00e1reas de estudo e da \n\npesquisa sociol\u00f3gica; e por fim, 5. Conclus\u00f5es. \n\nA pesquisa realizada permitiu um profundo conhecimento e compreens\u00e3o da evolu\u00e7\u00e3o das \n\ncaracter\u00edsticas das \u00e1reas de estudo, seu desempenho atual em conserva\u00e7\u00e3o da natureza, \n\necoturismo e educa\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental. Os principais resultados obtidos mostram que as \u00e1reas de \n\nestudo de Belarus e de Portugal s\u00e3o \u00e1reas de alto valor de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o. No entanto, as \n\nabordagens e objectivos de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00e3o bastante diferentes nos dois pa\u00edses: as zonas \n\nh\u00famidas belarusas est\u00e3o muito melhor conservadas e ativamente envolvidas em pr\u00e1ticas de \n\nconserva\u00e7\u00e3o regulares que provam ser altamente eficientes; os objectivos priorit\u00e1rios para as \n\n\u00e1reas s\u00e3o a sua restaura\u00e7\u00e3o atrav\u00e9s da pesquisa cient\u00edfica, conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e uso sustent\u00e1vel que \n\nsignifica a prote\u00e7\u00e3o, o desenvolvimento do ecoturismo, pr\u00e1ticas de educa\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental e \n\nenvolvimento da popula\u00e7\u00e3o local. As zonas portuguesas est\u00e3o bastante alteradas e sujeitas a \n\na\u00e7\u00f5es de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o pontuais; os objectivos priorit\u00e1rios para estas \u00e1reas s\u00e3o a conserva\u00e7\u00e3o \n\natrav\u00e9s de medidas para a recupera\u00e7\u00e3o de esp\u00e9cies e habitats, sem o objectivo priorit\u00e1rio de \n\nrestaura\u00e7\u00e3o de ecossistemas, verificando-se algumas limita\u00e7\u00f5es do seu uso por status de \n\nprote\u00e7\u00e3o e regula\u00e7\u00e3o de pr\u00e1ticas ilegais, controle de visitas e desenvolvimento da educa\u00e7\u00e3o \n\n\n\n5 \n\nambiental e ecoturismo. O conceito de abordagem em Portugal revela-se pouco sustent\u00e1vel, \n\npois n\u00e3o recorre a atividades de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o regulares e as zonas h\u00famidas funcionam ou de \n\nprote\u00e7\u00e3o formal e preven\u00e7\u00e3o de sua futura utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o ou concentram-se na educa\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nambiental. \n\nOs resultados da pesquisa sociol\u00f3gica tamb\u00e9m provam a maior efici\u00eancia do desempenho das \n\n\u00e1reas belarusas mostrando o maior n\u00edvel de conhecimento sobre as \u00e1reas de estudo e as suas \n\natividades. \n\n \n\nPalavras Chave: \n\nConserva\u00e7\u00e3o de zonas h\u00famidas, an\u00e1lise comparativa, charco, paul, turfeira, projeto de \n\nconserva\u00e7\u00e3o da natureza, ecoturismo, educa\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n6 \n\nABSTRACT  \n\n \n\nThe present thesis is devoted to comparative study of freshwater wetland areas in 2 countries \n\n\u2013 Belarus (the country of the author\u2019s origin) and Portugal (the country of Master studies). 7 \n\nresearch sites were chosen \u2013 3 mires in Belarus and 4 marshes in Portugal. The research was \n\ndone in the field of their nature conservation performance, current use of wetland resources \n\nand future perspectives of use and conservation. Besides, the examples of the 2 successful \n\nwetland conservation projects in both countries, in which the author participated, were \n\nprovided. Moreover, the sociological survey on assessing awareness of potential tourists \n\nabout the research sites was conducted and its results presented. As a result, the comparative \n\nanalysis was conducted to determine similarities and differences in wetland conservation \n\napproaches and practices in Belarus and Portugal and to identify the positive aspects and \n\nexperience that could be used by each side in the future. \n\nThe work has the following structure: 1. Introduction of the study, its objectives, structure, \n\nmethodology; 2. Issue background \u2013 overview of Belarusian and Portuguese freshwater \n\nwetlands and their conservation experience; 3. Research data \u2013 presentation of the 7 research \n\nsites and 2 wetland conservation projects; 4. Results \u2013 comparative analysis of the research \n\nsites\u2019 performance and analysis of the results of the sociological survey; 5. Conclusions \n\nThe thesis research has produced a deep knowledge and understanding of the past and present \n\nfeatures of the research sites, their current performance in nature conservation, ecotourism \n\nand environmental education. \n\nThe main results obtained show that both Belarusian and Portuguese research sites are high \n\nconservation value areas. However, the conservation approaches and objectives are \n\ncompletely different in the countries: Belarusian wetland areas are much better conserved and \n\nactively involved in regular conservation practices which prove to be highly efficient; the \n\npriority objective set for the sites is their restoration through scientific research, conservation \n\nand sustainable use by protection, development of ecotourism, environmental education \n\npractices and involvement of local population. Portuguese sites are transformed to high extent \n\nand are subjected to unregular and inefficient conservation actions; the priority objective set \n\nfor the sites is conservation of the sites through measures for recuperation of species and \n\nhabitats without the objective of restoration of ecosystems, limitation of their use by \n\nprotection status and regulation of illegal practices, visit control, and developing \n\nenvironmental education and ecotourism practices. In practice, the Portuguese concept proves \n\n\n\n7 \n\nto be unsustainable: it does not imply regular conservation activities which causes further \n\ndegradation of the landscapes and the sites either function for formal protection and \n\nprevention of their further use or concentrate on environmental education.  \n\nThe results of the survey also prove the higher efficiency of Belarusian sites\u2019s performance \n\nshowing higher level of awareness about the research sites and their activities. \n\n \n\nKeywords: \n\nWetland conservation, comparative analysis, mire, bog, marsh, nature conservation project, \n\necotourism, environmental education. \n\n  \n\n\n\n8 \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n\n \n\nAppendix \n\n  \n\nList of Abbreviations and Symbols\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026... 9 \n\nIndex of Figures\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 10 \n\nIndex of Tables\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 12 \n\n1.

Introduction \n\n \n\n1.1. Scope and framework of the study  \n\n \n\nNowadays wetland conservation is a topical issue since climate change leaves us fewer and \n\nfewer opportunities to survive and prosper on our planet. Conservation activities do not keep \n\nup with degradation processes, rising CO2 emissions, melting glaciers and dying coral reefs. \n\nSaving wetlands in this situation has become a potential solution since they carry out a crucial \n\nfunction \u2013 support of rich biodiversity, hydrological regulation, accumulation of CO2 in case \n\nof peatlands and other greenhouse gases which allow us to speed down global warming \n\nprocesses. Moreover, for Belarus it is highly useful since we plan to start selling carbon \n\ncredits on account of existing and restored peatlands (Restoring Peatlands, 2011). \n\nOn the other hand, a great wetland potential is simultaneously constrained by the degradation \n\nprocesses and its \u201cadverse to natural\u201d effects: biodiversity loss, fires, water pollution (IPCC, \n\n2014); degraded peatlands tend to produce greenhouse gas emissions due to decrease of \n\ngroundwater level, peat fires and therefore contribute to climate change (Restoring Peatlands, \n\n2010a).  \n\nWhat is more, climate change itself threatens wetlands since rising temperatures together with \n\nwater run-off due to past drainage cause summer draughts and further loss of wetland \n\nfunctions. For instance, as Earth Peoples Blog, 2012 states, \u201cwarmer summer weather \n\nthreatens to thaw the large peatland areas of Canada and Russia, causing them to decompose. \n\nThere is also a risk that fossilised methane, stored under these areas, could be released\u201d.  \n\nIt goes without saying that besides their air clearing capability, wetlands serve as habitats for \n\nunique species of flora and fauna. \n\nThus, wetland conservation on a global scale is a planet-saving tool and it is important to \n\ndevelop and support cooperation between countries and conservation organizations so that \n\nthey could share their experience, develop joint projects since wetlands do not see any \n\ncountry borders, they belong to nature. \n\nThis thesis is meant to serve as an example of such cooperation, combination of knowledge \n\nand experience of two countries (Belarus and Portugal) so that efficient practices of each \n\ncountry could be studied on the examples of particular wetland sites and, perhaps, applied in \n\nthe future in the other areas.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n14 \n\n1.2. Objectives, structure and methodology of the research  \n\n \n\nThe objective of the thesis is set to carry out a comparative analysis of conservation concepts \n\nand practices of Belarus and Portugal by exploring the particular protected wetland areas in \n\nboth countries (in the scheme below), analyzing their present status, activities and \n\nconservation and development projects ongoing there and provide examples of 2 projects (one \n\nfor each country) by participating in it personally and collecting the information needed. \n\nThe present master thesis has been divided into three parts: overview of wetlands in each \n\ncountry, analysis of the research sites and comparative analysis with conclusions. \n\nAs for the first part of the work, to conduct analysis of the research sites, it was decided to \n\nmake an overview of Belarusian and Portuguese wetlands so that the research sites and their \n\ncharacteristics could be seen within the general concept of wetland conservation in each \n\ncountry. This overview has been based on the following points:  \n\n? historical context, area size and value; \n\n? scientific research and conservation activities in recent years. \n\nThe second part of the work is devoted to analysis of the research sites (Table 1.1) including \n\ncharacterization of the 2 nature conservation projects \u2013 Aquatic Warbler Conservation project \n\nin Belarus and LIFE Trachemys in Portugal in which I participated and which are \n\nrepresentative for the work since they reflect current issue in freshwater wetland conservation \n\nfield in the two countries. The Belarusian project was carried out on 2 of the research sites. \n\nThe Portuguese one was not carried out on the research sites but since it is one of the few \n\ncurrent projects on wetland conservation in Portugal and the author participated in it, the \n\nproject was included for analysis in the thesis. \n\n \n\nTable 1.1 Research sites in Belarus and Portugal \n\nPortugal Belarus \n\nPaul de Arzila \u2013 NW Portugal \n\n \n\nSporava mire - SW Belarus \n\nPaul de Tornada \u2013 NW Portugal Zvaniec fen mire \u2013 SW Belarus \n\nPaul do Boquilobo \u2013 NW Portugal \n\nLagoa de Dom Jo\u00e3o, Serra de Montemuro \u2013 N \n\nPortugal \n\nJe?nia mire \u2013 N Belarus \n\n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nIn addition, water quality analysis was conducted for the 3 Portuguese sites and 1 Belarusian. \n\nPeat analysis results were obtained for 1 Portuguese and 3 Belarusian sites. \n\nWetland condition analysis was carried out for all the sites using the data of the National \n\nSystem of Information on Hydrological Resources and the results of the previous researches \n\non water quality parameters in the study areas. \n\nWhat is more, besides the analysis of the sites, the sociological survey was carried out to \n\nassess awareness of Belarusian and Portuguese people about wetlands in general and the \n\nresearch sites in particular and attractiveness of these sites for ecotourism. The results were \n\nfurther analyzed and included in the research data. \n\nFinally, comparative analysis is conducted in the third part of the work and conclusions of the \n\nresearch made having proved the efficiency of the work done and brought about interesting \n\nresults that can be applied further in wetland conservation management both in Belarus and \n\nPortugal. \n\n \n\nMethodology \n\nFull methodology of the work can be represented by the following fluxogram (Figure 1.1) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 General scheme of the thesis \n\n \n\n?

A deep \n\ninformation research was conducted so that the author could distinguish potential territories \n\nfor research in the two countries since comparative analysis is efficient as long as it can \n\nprovide useful results. This is only possible when the objects of research from the two sides \n\nhave common or similar characteristics, problems and reasons for these problems. In this case \n\nthe ways to tackle those problems (projects, development plans) by one side can be of great \n\nhelp for the other.  \n\nThus, the criteria for choosing wetlands for my research were based on my knowledge of \n\nparticular Belarusian protected wetland sites and their features \u2013 they are all freshwater \n\nmarshes of 2 types \u2013 fen mires and peat bogs, all of them with the consequences of drainage \n\nand (or) intensive agricultural use in the 20\nth\n\n century. Such consequences are violation of \n\nhydrological regime, water and soil contamination, destruction of habitats of plants and \n\nanimals. Most of the sites are protected and involved in active conservation actions on \n\nrestoration of hydrological regime by vegetation management, renaturalisation of habitats \n\nthrough rewetting of drained territories, ecotourism and environmental education. So, \n\nknowing that Portugal possesses similar territories it was extremely interesting for me to \n\nconduct research so that I could find examples of efficient conservation work and use this \n\nexperience in Belarus, and share our conservation practices. So, obviously, since I was \n\nsearching for successful models of development and Belarusian sites showed active \n\nconservation and development status it was necessary for me to explore \u201cactive\u201d wetlands in \n\nPortugal with the following characteristics:  \n\n? protected sites since they could provide conservation examples, unprotected ones, on the \n\nopposite, do not allow for getting enough information; \n\n? those which hold scientific research, ecotourism activities, conservation projects, active \n\nand accessible research teams so that I could communicate with them and see the possibilities \n\nof efficient wetland use and conservation.  \n\nHaving analysed general information on Portuguese wetlands I pointed out several criteria for \n\nchoosing these or those territories: \n\n? wetland type: I needed marshes with characteristics similar to Belarusian ones, freshwater, \n\nat least one with peat deposit since all the Belarusian research sites are peaty; \n\n? conservation status and history (problems that caused the need for protection, in Belarus it \n\nis drainage and its effects); \n\n? present activities in the area; \n\n\n\n17 \n\n? present challenges and conservation projects; \n\n? future plans; \n\n? the number of chosen territories was also meaningful. It must have been enough to get real \n\nresults, not too many. \n\nSo, there were 3 already chosen Belarusian sites \u2013 2 fen mires and 1 peat bog. \n\nAs for Portugal, it turned out peaty areas are mostly found in the Azores (which was not the \n\nthesis case, since these are islands) and in the mountainous regions of continental Portugal \n\n(some peat marshes are natural, the other ones with the consequences of intensive agriculture \n\nand little conservation work). Thus, the latter ones were not suitable for comparison with \n\nBelarusian peatlands, situated on flatlands, big in size and suffered from drainage, now being \n\nrestored and actively studied. Only one Portuguese peatland was chosen for the thesis, to give \n\nan example of undisturbed peatland landscape in the country, provide information on its \n\nhistorical formation and human use and check its current state. \n\nThe other 3 chosen Portuguese wetlands sites are mainly freshwater marshes, with similar to \n\nBelarus drainage consequences and current development scheme (so it seemed after the \n\nprimary analysis). Of course, it was impossible to know for sure those sites would be suitable \n\nenough from the point of view of current conservation actions and their efficiency, this could \n\nonly be known after visiting them. Fortunately, from the Belarusian side it was known our \n\nsites have shown positive results of their conservation activities. It would have been good if \n\nthe Portuguese ones also had had. \n\nSo, I have finally chosen 3 sites from each side, and 1 additional in Portugal since it was a \n\npeat bog, the only one among the Portuguese research sites but not representative enough for \n\ndescription of nature conservation activities.  \n\nAnalysis of the research sites implied visiting them, contacting research teams there and \n\ncollecting all the necessary information, as well as developing criteria for comparative \n\nanalysis. \n\nAnalysis of each site was carried out using the following analysis scheme: location, history \n\nand present main features, protection regime, area size and zoning, natural values, current \n\nstate: threats, management: past and present, what needs to be done and what is planned. \n\nAnalysis of the 2 conservation projects was based on the information obtained from the \n\nproject managers (Malashevich, 2013-2014 and CIBIO, 2013) and personal experience from \n\nparticipation in them. \n\nWater quality and peat analysis of the Belarusian sites was based on the research data \n\nobtained from Bahadziazh (2010), Thiele et al. (2012), Tanavickaja (2013). \n\n\n\n18 \n\nWater quality analysis of the Portuguese sites was based on the data from the Sistema \n\nNacional de Informa\u00e7\u00e3o de Recurcos H\u00eddricos (2013) and the research studies of Brito and \n\nMieiro (2000), Silva (2007). \n\nThe peat ph analysis at the peatbog of Lagoa de D. Jo\u00e3o was conducted with deionized water, \n\na ph meter Hanna Combo (Figure A87, Appendix), KCL solutions. Samples were obtained at \n\nthe 4 points of the bog (3 samples at each location). 40 cm\n3\n peat samples were mixed with \n\n100 cm\n3\n 1M KCL solutions. The ph meter was placed inside for 20-30 seconds. Analysis \n\nprocess and equipment are shown on Figure A88, Appendix. \n\nMoreover, the von Post Decomposition Index has been assessed for the research site (Figure \n\nA89, Appendix) which implies assessement of distinctness of the structure of plant remains \n\nand colour, determined by squeezing wet peat in the hand. \n\nWetland condition analysis was carried out with the use of the method of Clarkson et al., \n\n(2003). Wetland Record Sheet was filled for each site and wetland condition index \n\ndetermined. \n\nThe survey was created with the SurveyMonkey service and was spread through emails, \n\nFacebook, V kontakte (Belarus) and word of mouth. \n\nEach survey consisted of 10 questions (https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/999GRKN, \n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/s/SLHYBV7), allowing to determine the type of persons\u2019s \n\nactivity (work, hobby \u2013 connected/not connected with nature conservation, tourism, \n\nenvironmental education), evaluate their awareness about the wetlands (marshes, fens and \n\nbogs) and wetland protected sites of the country in general and knowledge about the particular \n\nwetland research sites of the thesis. \n\nComparative approach was further applied for the analysis of Belarusian and Portuguese \n\nresearch sites. The criteria were established taking into account the ones that were used for \n\ncharacterization of each protected area. Thus, they are as follows: protection status, historical \n\naspect of wetlands\u2019 formation, uniqueness, current threats, management, nature conservation \n\nactivities, ecotourism, water quality, public awareness, overall performance. It is also \n\nimportant to note that the 4th research site in Portugal (the peatbog in Lagoa do Dom Jo\u00e3o) \n\nwill not be included into the analysis since it has been an example of Portuguese peaty marsh \n\nbut completely natural and with no nature conservation management. \n\n  \n\n\n\n19 \n\n2. Issue background \n\n \n\n2.1 Overview of Belarusian wetlands \n\n \n\n2.1.1 Historical context, area size and value \n\n \n\nBelarus has always been the land of wetlands. The world indicator for wetland areas \n\npercentage is 6 % (AAAS, 2014), for the marshes (mires, peatlands) \u2013 3.4 % (Chichko, 2010) \n\nwhereas in Belarus it is 7 % and 6.4 % respectively (Astapovich, 2011). It holds 17\nth\n\n place in \n\nthe world by the peatland area (Fenchuk and Kazulin, 2012).  \n\nFurthermore, Belarus has 16 Ramsar sites with a surface area of 614 708 ha (Ramsar, 2013a), \n\nall of them being specially protected nature areas of a various state status: one national park \n\nand zakaznik (reserves). Besides, not only Ramsar sites but other wetlands are Important Bird \n\nAreas, Belarus has 49 such areas (Birdlife, 2014c). Among wetland types the dominant ones \n\nfor Belarus are fen mires and peat bogs, the other ones being lakes. \n\nIn the 1960s wetlands covered 15% of the country whereas mires were spread on 14,2% \n\n(Chichko, 2010), almost half of that area suffered from massive drainage in the 1960-1990s. \n\nAs a result the area of mires decreased to 6.4 % (Astapovich, 2011), the remaining area \n\nhaving been drained for the purpose of agriculture, forestry, and peat extraction.  \n\nAll in all, Belarusian mires can be divided into 3 groups by their current state: natural ones \n\nwith disrupted hydrology; drained and being used ones; abandoned drained peatlands being \n\nrestored in the recent years. The natural ones with disrupted hydrology are in a natural state \n\nbut are influenced by the surrounding drained areas, thus, have experienced disturbance of \n\nhydrological regime, water pollution, overgrowth with reeds. The main conservation \n\nmeasures are habitat and vegetation management. The drained peatlands which continue to be \n\nused for peat extraction, agriculture are out of the conservation measures. The abandoned \n\ndrained peatlands are current restoration project sites that have recently been rewetted. \n\nIt should be noted that drained peatland sites have caused large CO2 releases due to peat \n\ndecomposition whereas these areas are naturally meant to accumulate CO2 and thus reduce \n\ngreenhouse gas emissions. These degraded wetland areas are the reason for Belarus being the \n\n8\nth\n\n in the CO2 emissions list (IMCG, 2014). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nBiodiversity value \n\nAccording to BrantaTours, 2014, Belarusian wetlands are responsible for rich biodiversity \n\nbeing habitat for key rare and endangered plant species such as rare species of orchids, \n\nlichens, mosses, typical mire plant communities; rare bird species such as Greater Spotted \n\nEagle, Aquatic Warbler, Common Crane, Corncrake, Short-eared Owl. \n\nBogs are a place to see Terek, Marsh and Green Sandpipers, Whimbrel, Curlew, \n\nGolden and Ringed Plovers, Black-tailed Godwit, Greenshank, Redshank, Snipe, Great Snipe, \n\nRedshank, Spotted Redshank, Great Grey Shrike, Meadow Pipit, Citrine and Yellow \n\nWagtails, whilst the edges surrounding the pine bogs are typical breeding place for Osprey, \n\nGolden and Short-toed Eagles, Hobby and Merlin. \n\nOpen meadows and mires are hunting grounds for various birds-of-prey breeding in \n\nneighbouring floodplains and forests, such as White-tailed, Short-toed, Greater and Lesser \n\nSpotted Eagles, Honey Buzzard, Goshawk, Great Grey and Short-eared Owls. \n\nOld floodplain forests feature Hazel Grouse, Capercaillie, Woodcock, Middle Spotted \n\nWoodpecker, Black Stork, Eagle Owl, Roller, Redwing and Azure Tit. \n\nBesides birds, mammals are also encountered in the wetland areas and in the neighboring \n\nforests: Gray Wolf, Brown Bear, Wild Boar, Eurasian Lynx, Racoon Dog, Eurasian Elk, \n\nEuropean Roe Deer, European Beaver, European Bison, European Mink. \n\nThus, the wetlands of Belarus are an interesting tourist attraction that is well-known within \n\nthe bird watching community and is promoted in the country and for foreign visitors. \n\n \n\n2.1.2 Scientific research and conservation activities in recent years \n\n \n\nIn the 1990-2000s foreign scientists stimulated arising interest in wetland conservation in \n\nBelarus, having developed several projects, the most important one was connected with the \n\ndiscovery of the globally threatened bird species of Aquatic Warbler on one of the Belarusian \n\nfen mires and further research on this bird dependency on suitable wetland conditions \n\n(Kozulin and Flade, 1999). \n\nFor the recent 25 years there has been done a lot in the area of wetland conservation. Here are \n\none of the most significant actions implemented by APB-Birdlife Belarus, UNDP Belarus, \n\nvarious Ministries, local executive committees, local forestry entreprises, local population, \n\nvolunteers with both national and foreign financial support (UNDP, GEF, European Union \n\nfunds, USAID, Michael Otto foundation for environmental protection (Germany), Michael \n\nhttp://www.branta-tours.com/eightdays.php\nhttp://www.branta-tours.com/eightdays.php\nhttp://www.branta-tours.com/eightdays.php\n\n\n21 \n\nSuccow foundation (Germany), Royal Society for the protection of birds (UK), German KfW \n\nbank, Coca-Cola Beverages Belarus): \n\n?

Peatland Project (2006-2011) \u2013 Renaturalization and Sustainable Management of \n\nPeatlands in Belarus to Combat Land Degradation, Mitigate Climate Change, and Ensure \n\nConservation of Globally Valuable Biodiversity implemented by the Ministry of Forestry and \n\nAPB-Birdlife Belarus at 15 sites (Figure A2, Annex): approximately 28 000 ha of degraded \n\npeatlands rewetted and rehabilitated, their long-term protection secured, reduction of CO2 \n\nemissions by at least 300,000 tons annually, populations of threatened biodiversity species \n\nstabilized, risk of fires diminished significantly (UNDP, 2010b); \n\n? Restoring Peatlands and Applying Concepts for Sustainable Management in Belarus \n\n(2008-2012) \u2013 implemented by APB-BirdLife Belarus and the Michael Succow Foundation in \n\ncooperation with RSPB and the Government of Belarus. The project is financed by German \n\ngovernment through KfW bank. 10 designated sites \u2013 a large scale peatland investigation and \n\nrewetting programme: rewetting of ca 15 000 ha of degraded peatlands and calculation of \n\ngreenhouse gas emission reductions to facilitate certification and sale of carbon credits on the \n\nvoluntary market (Restoring peatlands, 2010b); \n\n? Creation of conditions for the development of eco-tourism at the Republican \n\nBiological Reserve \u201cSpora\u00faski\u201d (Biaroza district) with the minimal environmental \n\nimpact (2008-2009) \u2013 implemented by the local village council, funded by GEF-SGP: \n\nconstruction of ecological trails for tourists and schoolchildren, organization of environmental \n\nactivities for raising public awareness, organization of open championship on hay mowing \n\n(GEF-SGP, 2008a); \n\n? Eight wetlands 2011-now \u2013 web-project created to raise public awareness about the \n\ngovernment decision on reduction of the area of 8 wetland reserves for using that land for peat \n\nextraction: as a result of public signing of the petitions and active media coverage of the \n\n\n\n23 \n\nproblem, one of the reserves has managed to be left without any changes in its area, the \n\nsituation of the other ones has not been decided on yet (Eight Wetlands, 2011). This campaign \n\nhas been doing a lot in raising public awareness about Belarusian wetlands and their present \n\nproblems, widening the audience of indifferent people further than ecological community; \n\n? Aquatic Warbler (AW) conservation in Belarus project (2002 \u2013 up to now) has been \n\nimplemented by APB-BirdLife Belarus with support of RSPB. Belarus hosts 40% of this \n\nglobally threatened species, mostly on 3 key breeding sites of Zvaniec, Sporava and Dzikoje; \n\nthe bird serves as an indicator of wetland conservation state. What is done: habitat \n\nmanagement, monitoring of Aquatic Warbler numbers and distribution, Aquatic Warbler \n\ncounts in Sporava, Zvaniec and Dzikoje sites, study of migrations (Ministry, 2006; \n\nMalashevich, 2012). The AW counts project is fully described in chapter 3.1.4; \n\n? Sustainable scheme for peatland conservation and management developed: \n\ntransformation of the current approach to peatland use (balancing real income from peat \n\nextraction by hypothetical arguments of biodiversity conservation)to the new one (balancing \n\nreal income from peat extraction by real income from peatland restoration and conservation) \n\n(Fenchuk and Kazulin, 2012): \n\nKey elements of this scheme (Figure A3, Annex) are practical (how to reach maximum effect \n\nfor climate and biodiversity during rewetting), scientific (how to estimate the amount of \n\nemission reductions and the effect on biodiversity), economical (how to ensure flow of funds \n\nfor future managing rewetted peatlands and continuation of the work on restoration of \n\ndegraded peatlands; how to balance real money from peat extraction by real money from \n\npeatland restoration and conservation) and political (how to ensure the recognition of the \n\nsignificance of mires/peatlands and their importance for climate balance). \n\nEconomical effect is planned to be reached through selling carbon emission reductions on the \n\ninternational carbon market (Fenchuk and Kazulin, 2012); \n\n? Secondary bogging of exhausted peat field \u201cChore\u00faskaje\u201d and \u201cAstro?\u00faskaje\u201d with \n\nthe purpose CO2 emission reduction, prevention of peat fires and biodiversity protection \n\n(2009-2012) \u2013 implemented by APB-Birdlife Belarus, Mijory and Pru\u017eany village councils, \n\nPru\u017eany forestry entreprise, Je?nia reserve administration, with the support of the Ministry of \n\nNatural Resources and Environmental Protection, funded by GEF-SGP: waterlogging of the \n\ndepleted part of peat bog, restoration of hydrological regime and peat ecosystem on the 2 \n\nlowland bogs in the aim of prevention of peat fires, reduction of CO2 emission, preservation \n\nof biodiversity (GEF-SGP and APB, 2009a); \n\n\n\n24 \n\n? Sustainable Management of Wetland Protected Areas of International Importance in \n\nStolin district (2012-2013) \u2013 implemented by the local village council, funded by GEF-SGP: \n\ncreating condtions for development of ecotourism, environmental education in Mid-Prypia? \n\nreserve, upgrade of buildings of the reserve with energy-efficient technologies (SGP-GEF, \n\n2012); \n\n? Clima East \u201cConservation and sustainable management of peatlands in Belarus to \n\nminimize carbon emissions and help ecosystems to adapt to climate change\u201d (2014-2020) \n\n\u2013 implemented by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection with the \n\nsupport of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus, national reserves Zvaniec and \n\nSporava, local authorities of the Drahi?yn and Biaroza districts and APB-BirdLife Belarus, \n\nfunded by UNDP-GEF: aimed at restoration of Sporava and Zvaniec fen mires by mechanized \n\nmowing and collecting and use of biomass for fuel briquette production (ClimaEast, 2014); \n\n? Berries of Stolin district (2014-2015) - implemented by the local company, funded by \n\nGEF-SGP: the goal is to create conditions for reducing the degradation of peatlands in the \n\nwestern part of the Stolin district, through their involvement in agricultural use and setting up \n\nblueberry plantations; diversify agricultural production in private households of Stolin district \n\nby blueberry production development, including involvement of degraded peatlands (GEF-\n\nSGP, 2014); \n\nThus, wetland, and mostly, peatland conservation in Belarus implies combination of 2 aspects \n\n\u2013 conservation and education&amp;ecotourism. The conservation aspect involves conservation and \n\nscientific research, ensurance of formal protection of the areas, development of their \n\nmanagement plans and creation of the administrations of the wetland reserves (the last \n\nmeasure was first implemented within the project, proved to be successful, was approved by \n\nlegislation and now is practicedon the state level) (Malashevich, 2013-2014). \n\nThere are lots of bureaucratic barriers faced by the Belarusian environmental NGOs such as \n\nobligatory registration of the projects (only on condition of Letter of Support from the \n\nMinistry of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection), obligatory use of all the money \n\nduring the project (no possibility of savings, only target use of funds) (Malashevich, 2013-\n\n2014), financial control of the organizations by the state, financial problems (only foreign \n\nfunding which is often difficult to get), state management focused on getting only financial \n\nbenefits, neglecting environmental aspect, lack of ecological awareness in the society caused \n\nby a short history of ecological movement in Belarus. \n\nHowever, the wetland conservation community in Belarus is rather strong and not \n\nconcentrated on science only, they also devote their work to people and raising their interest \n\n\n\n25 \n\nin nature conservation. For example, there are voluntary camps annually organized by \n\nAPB-Birdlife Belarus within the Aquatic Warbler conservation project, dam \n\nconstruction on Je?nia peatbog; birds festival in Tura\u00fa, seasonal bird observations, \n\npublic petitions on the Internet, infocampaigns through creation of commercials, videos, \n\norganization of educational activities in public places.  \n\nMoreover, local communities play a significant role in saving traditional environments in \n\ntheir villages. The success of the past and present activities is in complex use of conservation \n\ninstruments (State-NGO dialog, foreign funding, scientific community, public campaigns, \n\nlocal population involvement, enthusiasm and concern about saving nature and its elements). \n\n  \n\n\n\n26 \n\n2.2 Overview of Portuguese freshwater wetlands \n\n \n\n2.2.1 Historical context, area size and value \n\n \n\nPortuguese continental wetlands (both freshwater and saltwater) are located mostly along the \n\ncoast of the country representing various wetland types, both natural and human-made: rivers, \n\nlakes, ponds, creeks, estuarine lagoons with extensive dune systems, mudflats and reedbeds, \n\nartificial salinas, alluvial plains; swamps, bogs, saltpans and saltmarshes, freshwater marshes \n\nwith series of drainage canals surrounded by agricultural lands and forest, rice fields and \n\nfishfarms, peat bogs.  \n\nAgricultural development has led to drainage of marshes and meadows, afforestation of \n\nmarginal lands during the 20\nth\n\n century which have caused disturbance of hydrological regime \n\nof the areas, soil erosion, increased water run-off, irregular river discharge, and \n\ntransformation of the landscpaes due to overgrowth with invasive plant species. This has \n\nposed a threat to a lot of aquatic bird species which have always used the wetland areas as \n\nmigrating stopovers, breeding and nesting sites. \n\nWork on making inventory of the Portuguese wetlands started in 1975 but had not brought \n\nany real result until 1999 when the Institute for Nature Conservation and Forests started a \n\nproject on conservation of wetlands having developed Action Strategy for the project focused \n\non the need for National Inventory of Wetlands (ZHP, 2014). \n\nWetland conservation was set as a priority in the National Strategy for Conservation of Nature \n\nand Biodiversity in 2001 (ZHP, 2014). \n\nThere is no accurate information on the whole wetland cover in Portugal. As for now, there is \n\ninformation that there are 1302 wetland areas (ZHP, 2014) identified in Portugal, continental \n\nand island parts (the Azores and Madeira). Moreover, according to MedWet/WIS database \n\nthere are 527 wetland sites covering 5.07 % of the overall number of Mediterranean wetlands \n\n(MedWet and Kapanidis, 2014).  \n\nThe terms for the types of wetlands in Portuguese are various \u2013 estu\u00e1rio (estuary), sapal \n\n(saltmarsh), charco (swamp, bog, mire), paul (more or less close to marsh), lagoa (pond), lago \n\n(lake), ribeira (river), pantano (swamp), turfa (peatbog), which can be natural, artificial, \n\npermanent or temporary. The 3 research sites of the thesis (Paul de Arzila, Paul do Boquilobo, \n\nPaul da Tornada) are of the \u201cpaul\u201d type which is closest to marsh in Belarus. The research \n\npeat site (Lagoa de D.Jo\u00e3o) is closest to peat bog in Belarus. \n\n\n\n27 \n\nThe Ramsar Convention on Wetlands came into force for Portugal in 1981. Portugal presently \n\nhas 31 sites designated as Wetlands of International Importance, with a surface area \n\nof 132,487 hectares which is 1.44% of the whole country area (Ramsar, 2013b). See Table \n\n2.1. \n\nAnalysis of the Ramsar list of Portugal allows us to classify the Ramsar sites according to \n\ntheir types. \n\nContinental freshwater wetlands are 12 of 31 Ramsar sites, belonging to the \u201cpermanent \n\nfreshwater marshes/pools, seasonal/intermittent streams/rivers, non-forested and forested \n\npeatlands\u201d types (Ramsar classification).  \n\nThe Azores possess 10 freshwater Ramsar wetlands \u2013 forested and non-forested peatlands, \n\npermanent/seasonal freshwater lakes/marshes/pools (Table 2.1). \n\nThus, Portugal on the whole has 22 internationally protected fully or partially freshwater \n\nwetlands covering almost 16% of the Ramsar areas of Portugal (Figure A4, Appendix). \n\nCalculations were made using the data on Ramsar sites of Portugal.  \n\n \n\nTable 2.1 Indicators of Portuguese Ramsar sites on the continent and the Azores (number, \n\narea, percentage) (Ramsar, 2013) \n\n Number of sites Area, ha %, of the country \n\narea \n\nRamsar sites 31 132 487 1.44  \n\nCont Portugal 18 119 587 1.3  \n\n? freshwater \nmarshes/lakes/peatlands \n\n \n\n12 8290 0.09  \n\n? other 8 111 297 1.21 \nAzores 13 12900 0.14  \n\n? freshwater lakes/peatlands 10 12790  0.139  \n? other 3 110 0.001  \n\n \n\nThus, Ramsar continental freshwater wetlands of Portugal cover 0.09 % of the country area or \n\n6.3 % of the Portuguese Ramsar area (Table 2.2). \n\nTable 2.2 Indicators of Portuguese Ramsar freshtwater wetlands (Ramsar, 2013) \n\n Number of sites Area, ha %, of the country \n\narea \n\n%, of the Ramsar \n\narea \n\nFreshwater wetlands \n\namong Ramsar sites \n\n20 21080 0.23  \n\n \n\n15.9 \n\n? continental FW 12 8290 0.09 6.3 \n? Azores FW 10 12790 0.139 9.6 \n\n \n\nMoreover, these areas are all protected at the national or municipal level, having different \n\nstate protection statuses: 5 natural parks, 8 natural reserves, 1 local natural reserve, part of 1 \n\n\n\n28 \n\nnational ecological reserve, 1 protected landscape, 1 natural regional monument, Rede Natura \n\n2000 sites, UNESCO Biosphere Reserves, Sites of Community Importance, Special \n\nProtection Areas (ICNF, 2014c) (Table A1, Annex). Besides, Portugal has designated 33 \n\nfreshwater wetland areas as Important Bird Areas (Birdlife, 2014d). \n\n \n\nValue \n\nThe Portuguese continental freshwater wetlands are important wintering and resting grounds \n\nfor migratory aquatic bird species using the Eastern Atlantic flyway to Africa (Ramsar, \n\n2013b). Moreover, many threatened species populations are supported thanks to the wetland \n\nareas as their breeding and nesting points: bird species (ducks, herons, flamingos, waders), \n\nmammal species (European otter, Wildcat), indigenous fish species (Iberian barbel), reptiles, \n\namphibians. \n\nWhat is more, the wetlands serve for regulation of the groundwater level, flood prevention, \n\nand human activities such as fishing, aquaculture, shellfish trade, traditional salt production. \n\nPeatbogs situated in the Portuguese mountaineous areas, have an important function of CO2 \n\nstorage. \n\n \n\n2.2.2 Scientific research and conservation activities in recent years \n\n \n\nConservation of wetlands in Portugal is an important aspect of its conservation policy. Having \n\nratified the Ramsar convention in 1981, the country has done a lot in designation of 31 \n\nwetland sites for conservation, development of Site Management Plans and promotion of \n\naquatic bird protection and sustainable use of wetland resources. Conservation of freshwater \n\nwetlands is part of the wetland conservation policy, 22 Ramsar sites out of 31 being fully or \n\npartially freshwater ones.  \n\nHowever, freshwater wetlands, as it seen above in the text, cover a small percentage of the \n\nprotected wetland areas; second, some of them have been seriously transformed by man and \n\nhave lost their natural functions; third, the Portuguese conservation approach in some wetland \n\nprotected areas (the thesis research sites are an example) does not imply recuperation of \n\nhabitats with their primary functions but means their designation with conservation status and \n\nminimizing human impact on the area, work with local population, regulation of hunting, \n\nfishing which often turns out to be permission for further landscape transformation with rare \n\nconservation actions. On the other hand, there are freshwater wetland areas where \n\n\n\n29 \n\nconservation and educational projects are actively developed and implemented and positive \n\nresults obtained in both biodiversity conservation and rasing public awareness. \n\nConservation projects developed and implemented in Portugal are usually those in \n\ncooperation with the EU countries and with the EU funds support. Here are several projects \n\nbrought to life in the recent 20 years in the freshwater wetlands of Portugal: \n\n? multiple researches on various conservation aspects undertaken by groups of scientists \n\nfrom the universities, environmental organizations (for example, researches for Ramsar Site \n\nManagement Plans, studies on expansive vegetation growth, evaluation of environmental \n\nquality in the wetland reserves made by the specialists of the Institute for Conservation of \n\nNature and Forests, the University of Lisbon, Porto, Coimbra, Algarve); \n\n? MedWet1 (1992-1996) \u2013 project of the Mediterranean Wetlands Initiative, aimed at \n\ndeveloping conservation methods and tools that would be specific to the Mediterranean, \n\ninitially involving 5 EU countries (Portugal, Spain, France, Italy and Greece) while also \n\ninvolving the countries of North Africa and the Middle East. The project was led initially by a \n\nSteering Committee chaired by the EC and then the Ramsar Bureau (MedWet, 2010a). \n\nThere were 5 sites participating in the project (one for each country). In Portugal it was Sado \n\nEstuary. The objectives set were as follows: to develop methods and tools specific to \n\nMediterranean wetlands in five areas: inventory and monitoring, wetlands management, \n\ntraining, public awareness, research results and dissemination. As a result, the developed tools \n\nwere applied to the research sites: 5 manuals for Inventory of Mediterranean Wetlands, \n\nmethodological guide for monitoring, training modules for management and monitoring \n\nwetland vegetation; \n\n? SUDOE: Inventory, assessment and monitoring for wetland management (2003-2004) \n\n\u2013 MedWet project implemented in 16 wetland sites of Portugal (7) and Spain (9) (among \n\nthem Paul de Arzila Natural Reserve, one of the thesis research sites). The objectives were as \n\nfollows: to provide the SUDOE region (Southwestern Europe) with a tool for the elaboration \n\nof management and monitoring plans for wetlands, to improve the MedWet inventory \n\nmethodology for wetlands, to promote public awareness and participation, contribute to the \n\ninstitutional development of each partner through exchange of information and \n\ncommunication of results (MedWet, 2010b).  \n\nThe results achieved: new datasheets added to the MedWet inventory methodology; \n\ncartographic conventions and data management with a GIS; seminars, training courses, \n\ncontribution to management plans of the sites, habitat description system applied to the sites; \n\n\n\n30 \n\n? Charcos com Vida \u2013 initiated by CIBIO in 2014: an educational campaign aimed at \n\ncreation of inventory on charcos (wetland type) and raising public interest and awareness, \n\nfocusing on the primary and secondary schoolchildren. The project suggests \u201cadoption\u201d of the \n\ncharcos (taking responsibility for characterization, observation, investigation, maintenance of \n\nthe area, organization of educational activities, spreading information about the intiative) or \n\nconstruction of the new charcos according to the techniques provided. This could be done by \n\nschools or other interested entities. Moreover, the project provides pedagogical materials on \n\nvarious aspects of the issue; \n\nLIFE programme has been a successful initiative for Portugal, having funded multiple \n\nconservation projects. Since its launch in 1992, there have been 73 projects in the field of \n\nnature conservation in Portugal (EU, 2014). Below are the LIFE projects implemented and \n\nplanned for implementation in the freshwater wetlands of Portugal: \n\n? LIFE Re-establishment of the Baixo Mondego marshes (1st phase, 1993-1995) \u2013 \n\ncoordinated by the National Service of Parks, Reserves and Nature Conservation: \n\npreservation the three wetlands of the Baixo Mondego marshes (Paul de Arzila, Paul da \n\nMadriz and Paul do Taipal) (EU, 1993): purchase of lands by state, innovative techniques in \n\nagriculture, creation of infrastructure for visits. \n\n? LIFE Porphyrio - Porphyrio project - Reintroduction of the Purple Gallinule in the \n\nLower Mondego River Valley (1998-2001) \u2013 implemented by the Institute of the Sea with \n\nthe support of the Institute for Conservation of Nature and Forests in Paul de Arzila and Paul \n\nde Madriz reserves: restoring a viable population of purple gallinules in the lower Mondego \n\nby re-introducing birds from Spain (EU, 1998). This project was innovative in Portugal, for it \n\nwas the first time that a soundly structured and monitored bird reintroduction plan was \n\nimplemented. \n\n? LIFE Palustris - Palustris, Management of the Special Area of Conservation of the \n\nMarsh of Arzila (2001-2006) \u2013 implemented by the Institute for Conservation of Nature and \n\nForests and Paul de Arzila Nature Reserve (EU, 2001).  \n\n? LIFE Trachemys (2011-2013) \u2013 EU funded project for Spain and Portugal on eradication \n\nof alien species of freshwater turtles thorugh their captures: the results are described in \n\nchapter 3.2.5 (EU, 2011). \n\n? LIFE Ecotone Management of riparian habitats towards the conservation of \n\nendangered invertebrates (2012-2016) \u2013 implemented by QUERCUS (EU, 2012). \n\n\n\n31 \n\nThis project is targeting the conservation of alder alluvial forests in two Portuguese rivers \n\n(Rio Paiva, Torgal stream in Costa Sudoeste), in order to increase the populations of three \n\nspecies of dragonfly. The project also sets out to improve the conservation status of two \n\nspecies of freshwater pearl mussels (EU, 2012a). \n\n? LIFE Charcos Conservation of Temporary Ponds in the Southwest Coast of Portugal \n\n(2013-2017) \u2013 implemented by the League of Nature Conservation. Mediterranean temporary \n\nponds (CTMs) are seasonal wetland habitats, subjected to extreme and unstable ecological \n\nconditions (EU, 2013). Due to their uniqueness and scientific value, they are listed as a \n\npriority habitat for conservation in Annex I of the EU Habitats Directive. The project\u2019s \n\noverall aim is to enhance the conservation status in southwest Portugal of Mediterranean \n\ntemporary ponds (CTMs) (EU, 2013). \n\nExpected results: The project\u2019s main expected result is to halt the loss of temporary ponds in \n\nthe Costa do Sudoeste Natura 2000 site, reversing the declining trend observed in the past few \n\nyears. Conservation and demonstration actions are planned for at least 16 temporary ponds, \n\nand in some of the ponds more than one type of conservation action will be applied \n\nsimultaneously. \n\nIt can be seen from the information above that there have been various initiatives in the field \n\nof freshwater wetland conservation in Portugal. Some of them are implemented in the \n\nprotected areas, the other ones concern the unprotected territories in need for conservation \n\nactions. The projects are funded from the EU funds (LIFE, joint country initiatives) and \n\nbrought to life by Portuguese NGOs (Quercus, League for the Protection of Nature, etc) and \n\ngovernmental environmental entities (ICNF, administrations of the protected areas). However, \n\nit should be noted that funding for the project is difficult to obtain in Portugal, and the process \n\nof project implementation is often delayed or disturbed by bureaucratic barriers. The \n\nconservation initiatives are implemented more efficiently within the particular projects in the \n\nunprotected wetland areas and are sporadic under the management policy of the protected \n\nones. The wetland conservation community in Portugal is devoted to their goals but lacks \n\nmotivation and reliable sources for that: its members have faced so many obstacles on their \n\nway (both at the European, national and local level) that the low efficiency of their current \n\nwork can be seen as a consequence of the previous processes.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n32 \n\n3. Research data \n\n \n\n3.1 Research sites: Belarus \n\n \n\n3.1.1 Sporava mire \n\n \n\n3.1.1.1 Location \n\n \n\nSporava mire is a fen mire (Europe\u2019s largest complex of natural floodplain fen mires) situated \n\nin Southwest Belarus, Brest region, in the area of 4 districts \u2013 Biaroza, Drahi?yn, Ivanava and \n\nIvacevi?y, in the floodplain of the middle course of the Jasie?da River, left affluent of the \n\nPrypia? River, Black Sea basin (NAS, 2009a) (Figure 3.1). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 Location of Sporava mire (Google Earth; Malashevich, 2014a) \n\n \n\n\n\n33 \n\n3.1.1.2 History and present main features \n\n \n\nThe area of the reserve is represented by the landscapes of ancient alluvial lowlands with wide \n\nand poorly drained floodplain and floodplain terraces complicated by lake and peat-filled \n\ndepressions. First, there is a tectonic fracture in the area between such tectonic structures as \n\nPalie?sie depression in the east and Brest depression in the west which served as a pre-\n\ncondition for wetland formation. Second, there is a lake-mire depression in the area of Lake \n\nSpora\u00faskaje formed in the postglacial period (NAS, 2009a). Thus, there are at least two \n\nfactors which determined the conditions of excess wetting of the area. \n\nThe Jasie?da floodplain, which is 0.5\u20132 km wide, is a typical fen mire. Lowland mires \n\nabsolutely dominate the landscape occupying peaty or peaty-gleyed moderately acid soils \n\n(NAS, 2009a). A typical feature of Sporava mire is the layer of sapropel under peat which is a \n\nclear evidence of past existence of shallow lakes on this territory. \n\nThere has been developed the following scenario of Sporava mire formation:  \n\n? 13 thousand years ago the alluvial lowland was occupied by the rather stagnant shallow \n\nlake with the ongoing process of sapropel deposition. The process was rather slow due to cold \n\nweather conditions and poor mineral nutrition; \n\n? 6.5 thousand years ago there was a blowout of the water from the lake which caused \n\nfurther formation of the Jasie?da River. The ancient lake gradually became shallow and started \n\nto turn into the mire, whereas its former area turned into the Jaselda floodplain. Peat \n\ndeposition has occurred since that in the floodplain (NAS, 2009a). \n\nThe mires within the reserve comprise a solid continuous tract (75% of the area) stretched \n\nalong the Jasie?da River for about 35 km (NAS, 2009a).  The centre of the reserve is occupied \n\nby Lake Spora\u00faskaje which provides conditions for close proximity of ground water table to \n\nthe soil surface.  \n\nMost of the site is covered by open fens and shrubs. There are numerous small hills and low \n\nmineral islands scattered across the mire. In the past, these mineral islands were covered by \n\noak and pine woods. Eventually the forests were cut, and the islands were used as agricultural \n\nfields and pastures. Today most agricultural fields are abandoned and the natural vegetation is \n\nregenerating. Nowadays the hills are covered with oak, birch, black alder and ash. \n\nMost of the site area appears to be in condition very close to the natural one, however, it is \n\ninfluenced by the surrounding areas which were drained for agricultural purposes and \n\nintensively used in the 1970-80s (NAS, 2009a). Around 20 years ago all the drainage system \n\nwas turned off, however, the consequences of its construction continue to influence the mire. \n\n\n\n34 \n\nAs APB, 2009b states, before drainage the hydrological regime of the Jasie?da River was \n\ntypical of flatland rivers: every spring high floods would occur, followed by prolonged \n\nsummer dry periods, regularly interrupted by rainfall. Sialiec fishfarm and a reservoir were \n\nconstructed in the river floodplain (NAS, 2009a). They have seriously influenced the \n\nhydrological regime of the river. In the past, in spring the filling of the fishfarm\u2019s ponds was \n\ncarried on, so spring floods were almost absent, but summer inundations have become \n\ncommon since in the summer the fishfarm let out the water intensively and high rains added \n\nto the flooding, thus, this caused increase in ground nesting birds\u2019 mortality. Disruptions in \n\nthe hydrological regime have resulted in intense overgrowth of the river channel and the lake, \n\nsevere annual inundation of the floodplain and catastrophic droughts and fires during the year. \n\nIn 1991 the Sporava mire got a state protection status of a biological reserve and became 1\nst\n \n\nRamsar site in Belarus in 1999 (NAS, 2009a). \n\n \n\n3.1.1.3 Protection regimes \n\n \n\nSporava mire has the following national and international protection statuses: \n\n? National \u2013 Spora\u00faski state biological reserve (zakaznik) established in 1991,  \n\nrenamed and expanded Spora\u00faski republican biological reserve established in 1999 \n\n(NAS, 2009a). Logo of the reserve is on Figure 3.2, showing the Aquatic Warbler \n\nas a key species; \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 Logo of the reserve (Wikimapia, 2014) \n\n \n\n? International \u2013 Ramsar site established in 1999 (first in Belarus), Important Bird Area \n\n(IBA) established in 1998 (Ramsar, 2013a). \n\n \n\n3.1.1.4 Area size and zoning \n\n \n\nSpora\u00faski reserve has an area of 19 384 ha (NAS, 2009a). It represents a weakly disturbed \n\npart of flat Jasie?da floodplain with ducts, oxbows and fen mires (Figure 3.3). It can be \n\n\n\n35 \n\ndivided into the following landscape parts: Jasie?da floodplain, drainage canal system, Lake \n\nSpora\u00faskaje, open fen mires themselves. \n\nMore correct and logical zoning is division into two zones (NAS, 2009a):  \n\n? Narrow and heavily waterlogged Jasie?da floodplain 25 km long, with the overgrown \n\nriverbed \u2013 sedges along the watercourse, further regularly flooded area of the floodplain, and \n\ntypical fen mires 500-2000 m on each side of the river; \n\n? Area of Lake Sporauskaje \u2013 greatly expanded Jasie?da floodplain with open mires of \n\nvarious type and mineral islands (Figure 3.3). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 Location and boundaries of the Spora\u00faski reserve (Malashevich et al., 2008) \n\n \n\nOverall area of weakly disturbed and natural ecosystem is 95 % of the reserve. \n\n? 59.6 % of the area is covered with mires (open (40.8 %) and overgrown (18.8 %) ones); \n\n? 24.7 % - lands covered with forest (21 %) and bushes (3.7 %); \n\n\n\n36 \n\n? 4.9 % - mineral islands between mires; \n\n? 8.9 % - underwater lands; \n\n? 1.9 % - recultivated peat extraction (NAS, 2009a). \n\nThe open mire area has decreased by 21 % since 1955 and it is predicted that the area of open \n\nmires will decrease by 18 % by 2025 (NAS, 2009a). Full table on past and predicted \n\ntransformation of landscape types is Table A2, Appendix. \n\nLand plots and water bodies of the reserve belong to the state and are used by 27 agricultural \n\nentreprises and forestry enterprises (with the main part of the area used by the enterprises of \n\nBiaroza and Drahi?yn districts (Figure A6, Appendix; NAS, 2009a).  \n\n \n\n3.1.1.5 Natural Values of Sporava mire \n\n \n\nThe main natural value of the site is represented by the fact that Sporava mire is one of the \n\nlargest European habitats of the Aquatic Warbler Acrocephalus paludicola (Figure 3.4), a \n\nglobally threatened bird species, hosting 5 % of its global population (Malashevich, 2013-\n\n2014).  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4 Aquatic Warbler in Sporava mire (Tourist Kobrin, 2014) \n\n \n\nMoreover, the site is unique for Europe in respect to its area and natural state of the \n\nlandscapes \u2013 unique complex of mesotrophic and eutrophic fen mires characterized by high \n\npeat deposit, important function of CO2 regulation. \n\nIt is one of the largest lowland mires in Palie?sie region. It plays water regulatory role for the \n\nJasie?da purifying the effluents from the drained area and preventing flooding of the nearby \n\nvillages and agricultural lands by water storage (NAS, 2009a). \n\n\n\n37 \n\nFlora is determined by the fen mire landscape: dominant species are sedges (Acute Sedge \n\nCarex acuta, Tufted Sedge Carex elata), along the Jasie?da watercourse there are reeds \n\n(Common Reed Phragmites australis) (NAS, 2009a);  \n\nBirches are dominant tree species, willows (Salix sp.) are also encountered in most places, \n\nboth being indicators of mire overgrowth; \n\nRare species of orchids, e.g. Cypripedium calceolus, or a lady\u2019s-slipper orchid (Figure A8, \n\nAppendix), are encountered here (NAS, 2009a). \n\nFauna of the site is determined by the dominance of open fen mires: \n\n? 123 bird species, among them, besides Aquatic Warbler, rare species of Corncrake  Crex \n\nCrex, Great Snipe Gallinago media, Bittern Botaurus stellaris, Black Stork Ciconia nigra, \n\nEurasian Curlew Numenius arquata, Short-Eared Owl Asio flammeus, Savi\u2019s Warlber \n\nLocustella luscinoides, Little Bittern Ixobrychus minutus, Short-toed Snake-eagle Circaetus \n\ngallicus, Hen Harrier Circus cyaneus, Lesser Spotted  Eagle Aquila pomarina, Greater \n\nSpotted Eagle Aquila clanga, Black-tailed Godwit Limosa limosa; \n\n? 20 mammal species, among them European Badger Meles Meles, Eurasian Elk Alces Alces, \n\nEuraisan Roe Deer Capreolus Capreolus, Wild Boar Sus scrofa, Red Fox Vulpes vulpes, \n\nEuropean Hare Lepus europaeus, Short-tailed Weasel Mustella erminea, Eurasian Polecat \n\nMustella putorius, European Otter Lutra lutra, Eurasian Beaver Castor fiber, Raccoon dog \n\nNyctereutes procyonoides. Muskrat Ondatra zibethica; \n\n? 34 fish species; \n\n? 6 reptile species, rare European Pond Turtle Emys orbicularis, Sand Lizard Lacerta agilis \n\nand Grass Snake Natrix Natrix are common; \n\n? 6 amphibian species, Moor Frog Rana arvalis and Common Frog Rana temporaria are \n\nmost common (NAS, 2009a). \n\nIt is important to note that Sporava is a habitat for 48 species from the Red Data Book (NAS, \n\n2009a). \n\n \n\n*Cultural value of Sporava mire \n\nSporava mire represents a traditional natural landscape with evidence of past life and \n\nactivities of local people: earlier the typical feature of this region was \u201cchutary\u201d \u2013 the houses \n\nlocated far from each other on the mineral islands. Now the remains of these houses are traces \n\nof orchards and areas where houses were standing. \n\n  \n\n\n\n38 \n\n3.1.1.6 Current state: threats \n\n \n\nAs it was mentioned above, Sporava mire has suffered from drainage and intensive \n\nagricultural use of the surrounding area having caused nutrient pollution. The mire itself was \n\nnot drained and represents an untouched landscape with the consequences of the actions on \n\nnearby territories which are as follows, according to UN, 2002; NAS, 2009a: \n\nOverall change in hydrological regime of the river: \n\n? canalization of the upper course of the Jasie?da River from the source to the upper limits of \n\nthe reserve (30% of the Jasie?da catchment area has been drained); \n\n? construction of the water reservoir and Sialiec fishfarm upstream of the reserve in 1977-\n\n1986 led to almost total absence of spring floods due to filling of fishfarm reservoirs, high \n\nsummer inundations due to water discharge from the fishfarm, as a consequence \u2013 flooding of \n\nbird nesting sites, disappearance of rare plant species; \n\nTable A3, Appendix shows a drastic increase of the Jasie?da runoff before and after drainage \n\nof the 1970-80s. \n\nWater pollution \n\n? industrial waste and domestic sewage from Biaroza;  \n\n? agricultural affluents from cattle-breeding farms and drainage activities; \n\n? chemical pollution from the Sialiec fishfarm; \n\n? as a result \u2013 overgrowth of the riverbed and Lake Spora\u00faskaje; \n\nVegetation change on dry elevated hills due to ploughing and overgrazing in the past; \n\nOvergrowth of open mires with bushes and trees (reeds, willows, birches) which results in \n\nunsuitability of these localities for Aquatic Warbler. Evidence of the indicated threats is on \n\nFigure 3.5. \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.5 Views of the mire (Malashevich, 2014b) \n\n \n\nVegetation burning \u2013 it needs careful planning since it can have adverse effects: when it is \n\ncarried out in dry springs and upper peat layer is burnt, together with insects and plant seeds, \n\nvegetation will only regenerate in 2-3 years. On the other hand, when the areas are burnt in \n\nthe winter, when there is an ice layer, only upper grassy vegetation layer burns, thus, \n\ncontributing to vegetation control in the mire. \n\nIllegal fishing and hunting (Kuklov and Dym, 2006). \n\n \n\n\n\n40 \n\n3.1.1.7 Management: past and present \n\n \n\nManagement of the reserve is under responsibility of Spora\u00faski republican biological reserve, \n\nstate nature conservation enterprise created in 2005 (NAS, 2009a) as a unique result of \n\nefficient cooperation between district executive committees of Biaroza, Drahi?yn, Ivacevi?y, \n\nIvanava, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection and APB-Birdlife \n\nBelarus non-governmental organization. 6 people now work in the administration of the \n\nreserve (Malashevich, 2013-2014). \n\nThe activities carried out in the reserve are habitat management and nature conservation, \n\nhunting, fishing, ecotourism and environmental education. \n\nThe first Management Plan was developed for 2002-2006 and efficiently implemented. The \n\ncurrent Management Plan is for 2009-2013. \n\n \n\nConservation aspect \n\n \n\nScientific and public attention to Sporava mire was raised in 1995-1997 when Aquatic \n\nWarbler was discovered in the area by the Belarusian-German research team during their \n\nsearch for its nest places, with financial support of RSPB, Michael Otto Foundation \n\n(Germany) and UNDP Belarus (Kazulin and Flade, 1999). Breeding biology studies were \n\ncarried out from 1998. Ringing of the Aquatic Warbler has been conducted along with this \n\nwork. Since 1995 numerous studies on population development, habitat structure, breeding \n\nsuccess, diet of the species have been conducted. It was concluded that Sporava mire was one \n\nof the 3 key breeding habitats for Aquatic Warbler in Belarus hosting 5% of its world \n\npopulation which at the same time was suffering a severe decline (by 90% within the last 30 \n\nyears) (Kazulin and Flade, 1999) due to mire destruction by drainage and abandonment. \n\nDuring further research links and interactions between drainage measures and other \n\nalterations of the water regime, agricultural use, trophic level of the mires and vegetation \n\nsuccession were much better understood.  \n\nSince 1995 a number of projects have been implemented on on preparation of inventory on \n\nremaining sedge fen mires and AW populations in Belarus so that a fen monitoring system as \n\nwell as a conservation strategy for the Prypia? floodplain could be developed. Further \n\nconservation projects have contributed to development and implementation of the reserve \n\nmanagement plans: \n\n\n\n41 \n\n? Management planning for conservation of fen mire biodiversity in Belarus (1999-\n\n2002) was financed by Michael Otto Foundation for Environmental Protection (Germany) and \n\nUNDP Belarus and implemented by APB-BirdLife Belarus in cooperation with the Ministry \n\nof Natural Resources and Environmental Protection \u2013 development of Sporava \n\nManagement Plan (UNDP, 2002); \n\nIn the Management Plan all the threats were analysed and key necessary measures for the \n\nreserve set and prioritezed. \n\nThe main points of the plan 2002-2006 were as follows: \n\n1. main objective is to establish and sustain the conditions for regeneration and support of the \n\nopen mires, their vegetation and habitats of rare fauna species; \n\n2. regeneration of hydrological regime of the mire (water regulation system on old drainage \n\nchannels, control of water pollution levels); \n\n3. development of actions for prevention of further open mire overgrowth (mechanized \n\nmowing);  \n\n4. organization of infrastructure and all the necessities for ecotourism development; \n\n5. organization of monitoring system of water level and its quality, reserve ecosystems, \n\ndensity and breeding success of Aquatic Warbler; \n\n6. raising awareness of local population on the activities conducted in the reserve, involving \n\nlocal people in their planning and realization, information distribution through printing \n\nmaterials, media; \n\nThe 2002-2006 Management Plan was implemented within the Implementation of urgent \n\nrecommendations of the management plans for key biodiversity areas in Belarus project \n\n(UN, 2006b). It is decscribed in the Habitat management section below. \n\n? Catalyzing sustainability of the wetland protected area system in Belarusian Palie?sie \n\nthrough increased management efficiency and realigned land use practices (2006-2011) \u2013 \n\nimplementation of the 2006-2009 Management Plan for Sporava reserve: construction of \n\necotourism facilities, rehabilitation of populations of rare and endangered species, \n\norganization of hay-mowing and bush cutting, reconstruction of ameliorative systems \n\n(Malashevich et al., 2008-2009; UNDP, 2006a; 2010a-2011a). \n\n \n\nConservation activities within the developed management plans have been implemented in \n\nthe field of complex study of mire ecosystems. This is a wide term uniting the following \n\naspects: \n\n? Habitat management (hydrological and vegetation management); \n\n\n\n42 \n\n? Monitoring of AW numbers and distribution, breeding success and causes of nest \n\nmortality; \n\n? Study of feeding and nutritive base evaluations; \n\n? Study of migrations. \n\nEach of these aspects will be analysed below by characterization of the projects carried out. \n\nHabitat management \n\n? Hydrological management \n\nImplementation of urgent recommendations of the management plans for key \n\nbiodiversity areas in Belarus (2002-2006) (UNDP, 2006b). \n\nAccording to Malashevich et al. (2008-2009); UN (2002); UNDP (2006b), the following aims \n\nwere set and measures taken: \n\nAim 1. Optimisation of hydrological regime of the fen mire \u2013 construction of 1 sluice at \n\nSporava mire, water operation regulations developed for Sialiec fishfarm; \n\nWater operation regulations on water intake and discharge levels were approved in 2009. The \n\nmain regimes of water use were established as follows: \n\n? closure of reservoir sluices and accumulation of incoming water from the Jasie?da in the \n\nreservoir only during high floods and high precipitation years to prevent floodplain flooding; \n\n? limited letting of water from the reservoir into the floodplain in the years of low floods in \n\nApril-May; \n\n? in dry years and absence of spring floods there will be lack of water for the fishfarm and \n\nthe reserve, so, plan construction of water regulation site on the river aimed at water level \n\ncontrol and letting water into the river and the reserve through filtration of reservoir water; \n\nAim 2. Development of hydrological and species monitoring system to evaluate the \n\neffectiveness of taken measures \u2013 monitoring and ringing of the AW, the decline of the \n\nspecies was observed to have stopped even an increase in population as registered; \n\nAim 3. The establishment of management units for reserves \u2013 setting up Spora\u00faski reserve \n\nmanagement office. \n\n? Vegetation management: mowing \n\n20-30 years ago the mire was mown regularly by local people which has nearly stopped \n\ntoday. Mowing is highly important since it allows clearing the areas for new vegetation which \n\nserves as a habitat for a lot of species. However, it is impossible to restore the hand mowing \n\ntradition now, so, mechanized mowing has been implemented as an alternative within the \n\nfollowing projects. \n\n\n\n43 \n\n? Conserving unique biological diversity of lowland mires through their sustainable \n\nuse (2006-2009) implemented by APB-Birdlife Belarus \u2013 vegetation management at \n\nSporava \u2013 mowing and bush removal with tractors (Figure A10c; GEF-SGP, 2006b); \n\nThe results showed that mowing is technically possible and can be economically justified. \n\nAccording to Malashevich et al. (2008-2009), altogether 397 hectares of Sporava mire were \n\nmown and 30 hectares were cleared from bushes in 2006-2009. Monitoring works \n\nimplemented showed positive effect of habitat management, leading to up to 3 times increase \n\nin the density of vocalizing males of the Aquatic Warbler. \n\n? Restoring Peatlands and Applying Concepts for Sustainable Management in \n\nBelarus \u2013 Climate Change Mitigation with Economic and Biodiversity Benefits (2008-\n\n2012) \u2013 conducted by APB-BirdLife Belarus, RSPB, the Michael Succow Foundation in \n\ncooperation with the Government of Belarus and UNDP Belarus (Restoring peatlands, \n\n2010b). \n\nAs Malashevich (2011) states, innovative and highly efficient caterpillar mowing device \n\n(ratrac) was specially adopted for working under mire conditions (Figure A9a, Appendix). \n\nThe staff was hired and trained from the local population. Mowing has been conducted \n\nregularly since 2011, during suitable weather conditions, except for a nesting season. Since \n\n2011 ca. 400 ha were mown (Malashevich, 2013-2014). \n\nAs Malashevichv (2013) states, due to mowing the habitat suitability improved, since a thick \n\nlayer of dry vegetation was removed and the area was partially cleaned from bushes (Figure \n\nA9b, Appendix). Partial removal of bushes was caused by a technical problem with the \n\nmowing device. There was no increase in AW numbers registered in 2012 for all 3 mown \n\nlocalities. This goes in line with the recent study on habitat productivity performed in Biebrza \n\nNational Park, Poland. Following the study, AW population increase was registered starting \n\nonly with the second year after mowing. \n\nRare plant species rehabilitation \n\nAccording to UNDP (2011b; 2006a), his measure was carried out within the project on \n\nCatalyzing sustainability of the wetland protected area system in Belarusian Palie?sie \n\nthrough increased management efficiency and realigned land use practices (2006-2011).  \n\nLady Bell flower, or Adenophora lilfolia rehabilitation was performed by the staff of the \n\nCentral Botanic Garden of the National Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Belarus.  The \n\nseedlings were grown with the use of cellular engineering techniques and by genotype are \n\nidentical to the plants of the species inhabiting the territory of Belarus. For Belarus this is an \n\ninnovative experience on reintroduction of rare plant species with the objective to establish a \n\n\n\n44 \n\nnew sustainable population in natural habitats. Schoolers from the nearby Zdzitava village \n\nparticipated in planting of the around 1000 sprouts. \n\nAt present Adenophora lilifolia can be found in the Belarusian Palie?sie mainly in semi-open \n\nareas with sparse broad-leaved forest or in bushes with sparse growth of oak in floodplains of \n\nlarge rivers. The total number of Adenophora lilifolia is not more than 300 plants.  \n\n? Monitoring of AW numbers and distribution \n\nAquatic Warbler monitoring in Belarus project (2002 \u2013 up to now) \u2013 habitat management, \n\nmonitoring of Aquatic Warbler numbers and distribution, Aquatic Warbler counts in Sporava, \n\nZvaniec and Dzikoje sites, study of migrations (Ministry, 2006; Malashevich, 2012). \n\nResearch of Aquatic Warbler breeding habitats in Belarus started in 1995. Since then \n\nmonitoring of breeding mechanisms, distribution and optimal water level for breeding was \n\nconducted. The project will be described in detail in Chapter 3.1.4 of the dissertation. \n\n? Sporava Caretakers\u2019 Network \n\nThe project \u201cCreation of caretakers\u2019 network on the key Belarusian wetlands\u201d was initiated by \n\nAPB-Birdlife Belarus with the help of its members and financial support of foreign partners \n\n(APB, 2010a). The network of the caretakers is a voluntary community of local people \n\nresponsible for monitoring of Important Bird Areas, their state and reporting to the nature \n\nconservation entities (APB, regional branches of the Ministry of Natural Resources and \n\nEnvironmental Protection) about threats, change in numbers of key bird species, their \n\nhabitats, environmental education of local population (APB, 2014).  \n\nSporava\u2019s caretakers have produced a lot of efficient results: participation in Aquatic Warbler \n\ncounts, reporting about the threats for the mire. \n\n \n\nDevelopment aspect (education, tourism) \n\n \n\nTourism and environmental education are seen as priorities for future reserve development. \n\nThe following facilities and events already exist (Tourisitc Brest, 2014a; Biaroza, 2014): \n\n? visitor centre next to the mire itself with accommodation facilities (9 places) including \n\nfacilities for the disabled, maps of the reserve routes, printed materials for visitors (maps, \n\nbooklets) (Figure A11, Appendix); \n\n? accommodation facilities at the nearby agricultural farmsteads; \n\n? equipped pedestrian trail with 2 observation points next to the visitor centre, a campsite \n\nnext to the Jasie?da River, ferry crossing (Figure A12, Appendix); \n\n\n\n45 \n\n? 4 more ecological trails (water, pedestrian, bike and mixed ones) developed and planned to \n\nbe equipped (Figures A7, A13, Appendix);  \n\n? organization of various excursions; \n\n? rental of boats, bikes, tourist equipment (tents, sleeping bags).  \n\nThese actions were brought to life within the following projects: \n\n? Creation of conditions for the development of eco-tourism at the Republican \n\nBiological Reserve \u201cSpora\u00faski\u201d (Biaroza district) with the minimal environmental \n\nimpact (2008-2009) \u2013 construction of ecological trails for tourists and schoolchildren, \n\norganization of environmental activities for raising public awareness, organization of open \n\nchampionship on hay mowing (GEF-SGP, 2008a); \n\n? Catalyzing sustainability of the wetland protected area system in Belarusian Palie?sie \n\nthrough increased management efficiency and realigned land use practices (2006-2011) \u2013 \n\nconstruction of ecotourism facilities, documentary shooting (UNDP, 2010a-2011a). \n\nHowever, the timetable of the centre requires prebooking of the visit and does not guarantee \n\nthe centre will be opened when the visitors come which decreases attractiveness of Spora\u00faski. \n\nFurthermore, there is a lack of direction posts for visitors. Moreover, there is not a web-site of \n\nthe reserve although there is much information on the Internet (in particular, on the web-sites \n\nof Brest region executive committee, Biaroza local executive committee, Brest region \n\ntouristm web-site, free of charge deal.by) since the reserve is known because of the AW \n\nconservation and promoted in the mass media reports. Belarusian and foreign scientists, \n\nbirdwatchers, students visit Sporava for their research, participation in the volunteer camps on \n\nAW counts. There are school excursions and various educational activities for local schools \n\norganized in the reserve. Still, the information on Sporava for foreign tourists is almost absent \n\non the Internet. Those foreigners who come to the reserve are either from nature conservation \n\nfield or birdwatchers who got information from their friends in this field. However, the author \n\nencountered 3 links to the British sites on organization of bird tours where Sporava mire was \n\nincluded as a visit site (Naturalist and Limosa, 2014). The number of visitors (both national \n\nand foreign) of Sporava mire is growing judging by the 2011-2013 results shown in Table 3.1: \n\nTable 3.1 Number of visitors of Spora\u00faski reserve (2011-2013) (Malashevich, 2013-2014) \n\nNumber of \n\nvisitors/excursions \n\n2011 2012 2013 \n\nBelarusian 1104 1798 2138 \n\nForeign 121 196 189 \n\nTotal 1225 1994 2327 \n\n\n\n46 \n\nIt is important to note that a visit to the reserve can be combined with cultural tourism \n\nactivities: destinations nearby \u2013 museums of traditional arts in the villages fortress remains, \n\nremains of the monastery. \n\nUnfortunately, among all the services offered, the reserve can also organize foreign hunting \n\ntours which is seen as an unacceptable service type for the reserve. Moreover, the \n\nconsequences of these hunting tours often show that these activities are done without any \n\nenvironmental analysis. \n\n \n\nRaising awareness about the unique fen mire habitats through environmental education \n\nand tourism \n\n? to raise public awareness about the necessity for conservation of Sporava mire and \n\nprevention of open mire overgrowth, in 2007 there was organized a national hand mowing \n\nchampionship called \u201cSpora\u00faskija sienakosy\u201d (Spora\u00faskija haymakings) which is now held \n\nannually attracting lots of participants and visitors (Figure A14, Appendix). The winner \n\nparticipates in the European hand mowing championship in Poland (Biebrzha National Park) \n\n(Brovach, 2013); \n\n? there is an annual festival in the Sporava village called Spora\u00faskiaja \u017earty, meaning \n\nSporava jokes, a festival of traditional local humour (Figure A15, Appendix; Viachorka, \n\n2013). \n\nLocal people are enthusiastic and represent a good basis for sustainable development of their \n\nvillages and the reserve. \n\n \n\n3.1.1.8 What needs to be done and what is planned \n\n \n\nSpora\u00faski reserve has shown a good progress in the recent years both in conservation and \n\ndevelopment field. The initiatives planned for the future are as follows: \n\n? already launched Clima East  project \u201cConservation and sustainable management of \n\npeatlands in Belarus to minimize carbon emissions and help ecosystems to adapt to \n\nclimate change\u201d (2014-2020) \u2013 aimed at restoration of Sporava fen mire by mechanized \n\nmowing and collecting and use of biomass for fuel briquette production (BELTA, 2013: \n\nClimaEast, 2014;) \n\n? pedestrian trail next to the visitor centre is being equipped for the disabled, the number of \n\nvisitors is planned to be increased by this measure; \n\n\n\n47 \n\n? 4 ecological trails to be equipped for visitors, direction posts to be set, map of the routes \n\nwill be provided for visitors; \n\n? there is a plan to be further developed an existing cycling route around 3 lakes so that the \n\nbikes could be rented and returned at any specially equipped point of the route; \n\n? the accommodation part of the visitor centre is being reconstructed for 5 rooms/8 visitors; \n\n? photoelectrical station is to be constructed in 2014 so that the reserve could provide itself \n\nwith energy and get revenues from its sale for nature conservation activities (implemented \n\nwithin the project of SGP/GEF and local environmental fund) (Viachorka,2014); \n\n? creation of a training centre on bioresources and alternative energy within the above \n\nmentioned project (Viachorka, 2014); \n\n? continuation of mechanized mowing. \n\nWhat is good, cooperation between the reserve administration, local executive committees, \n\nAPB-Birdlife Belarus, UNDP Belarus, foreign partners has been established thoroughly and is \n\nto be continued with success. \n\n \n\n3.1.1.9 Water quality and peat analysis \n\n \n\nData and detailed reults of the water quality and peat analysis are in Chapter 3.1.1 of \n\nAppendix. \n\nElevated values of the nutrients in the Jasie?da River near Sporava mire, high levels of sewage \n\ndischarge into the river. Peat ph values are in the normal range for fen mires (5.6). Peat is \n\nweakly decomposed (von Post decomposition index is h4). \n\n \n\n3.1.1.10 Wetland condition analysis \n\n \n\nThe table of evaluation is located in Chapter 3.1.1 of Appendix. The overall result obtained \n\nfor Sporava mire is 19.33 out of 25 which is a rather high value and evidence of close-to-\n\nnatural state of the mire with the consequences of drainage of the surrounding areas. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n48 \n\n3.1.2 Je?nia bog \n\n \n\n3.1.2.1 Location \n\n \n\nOne of the largest peat bogs in a state close-to-natural in Belarus and Europe, with multiple \n\nlakes (around 100). \n\nJe?nia is situated in Northwest Belarus, in Viciebsk region, the districts of Mijory and \n\n\u0160arka\u00fa\u0161?yna (Figure 3.6). The nearest point is the city of Mijory. The bog belongs to the \n\nbasin of the Western D?vina River, Baltic Sea basin (Kozulin et al., 2012). \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 3.6 Location of Je?nia bog (Google Earth; Malashevich, 2014a) \n\n \n\n\n\n49 \n\n3.1.2.2 History and present main features \n\n \n\nAs Kozulin et al., 2012 states, Je?nia peatbog was formed in the lowest part of Polack lowland \n\n(a result of postglacier lake existence here) with the basis of clay, rainwater gathering in the \n\nnarrow hollows and forming shallow lakes which then caused start of moss layer formation \n\nand deposit of moss peat. Wetland formation process began to cover larger and larger areas of \n\ndry lands of coniferous forest. Frequent forest fires contributed to the process. Moreover, poor \n\nmineral nutrition determined mainly rainwater feeding of the area, thus, the bog formation. \n\nThe process has taken 8200-9000 years (Kozulin et al., 2012), thus, it started a long time ago. \n\nThe Western D?vina River provides substantial part of the bog drainage through the system of \n\nits affluents. Lakes of the bog are connected with the basin by the drainage canals system and \n\nthe small rivers. \n\nThe water level regime of raised bogs depends on: the precipitation regime, evaporation of \n\nwater, water runoff from the bog, mire type, composition, and relief. Raised bog landscapes \n\nare characterized by: the spring maximum level coinciding with the maximum snowmelt; the \n\nsummer minimum level resulting from increased evaporation from the bog surface; the fall \n\nincrease of the level as a result of higher precipitation and lower evaporation; and the winter \n\ngradual decline of the level over the period between fall and spring owing to water runoff \n\nfrom the mire and lack of water inflow due to precipitation. \n\nMost of the bog is overgrown with low pines, but there are also significant open spaces with \n\nmultiple small lakes and open water bodies.  The core of the bog is a peat deposit covering 90 \n\n% of the reserve (Table A4, Appendix). Peat layer depth is 3.8 m on average, maximum of 8.3 \n\nm (Kozulin et al., 2012). \n\nThere are multiple mineral islands in the area of the bog covered with fir-trees and small-\n\nleaved forest. The Je?nia bog has traditionally been used by local people to gather cranberries \n\nOxycoccus palustris (Figure A18, Appendix). \n\nIn 1957\u20131959, before the establishment of the reserve, a network of drainage canals and \n\nditches was constructed in the eastern part of the bog (Kozulin et al., 2012). It was \n\nconstructed to facilitate peat extraction. Despite the fact that no peat extraction was \n\nsubsequently carried out here, the drainage network was causing a significant negative \n\ninfluence on the site. By now the canals and ditches have overgrown with vegetation, but they \n\ncontinue to impact the mire in a negative way. \n\nThe drainage implied straightening of the Je?nia rivers and construction of the channels which \n\ncaused serious disturbance of the hydrological regime of the raised bog: canal system started \n\n\n\n50 \n\nin the centre of the bog and went further through the lakes to the peripheral zones where the \n\nwater was further processed into the drainage system. As a result, water table fell up to 1m \n\nbelow the ground, dry peats started to mineralize and produce CO2 emissions. Hydrological \n\ncharacteristics of peat have changed: water did not accumulate in peat, it just flowed away. \n\nMoreover, the site became prone to fires, occurring regularly, with the most destructive ones \n\nin 1998 and 2002, with almost 70 % of the bog suffered (Figure A17, Appendix).  \n\nThe consequences are clearly visible: vegetation transformation \u2013 Pine Pinus sylvestris \n\ndisappearance in exchange for spread of European White Birch Betula pubescens, Silver birch \n\nBetula pendula and Aspen Populus tremula, Common heather Calluna vulgaris domination \n\namong shrubs, cranberries endangered (Figure A16, Appendix). What is more, decrease of the \n\ngroundwater level has been observed but, thanks to the dam construction projects since 2002, \n\nit has regenerated to a great extent. The groundwater level typical of the bog and set as the \n\naim to be reached is next to the surface level with small seasonal differences (Thiele, 2013). \n\nAccording to Tanavickaja, 2012b, the most disturbed areas are the ones in the centre and in \n\nthe south of the bog, in the areas of drainage canals and lakes. Natural peat bogs cover mostly \n\nnorthern part of the bog and do not need any conservation measures (Figure A20, Appendix). \n\nThe reserve was established here in 1968 with the status of the republican hydrological \n\nreserve and transformed into the landscape one in 2007 (Kozulin et al., 2012).  \n\n \n\n3.1.2.3 Protection regimes \n\n \n\nJe?nia bog has the following national and international protection statuses: \n\n? National \u2013 Republican landscape reserve, established in 1968 as a hydrological reserve, \n\ntransformed in 2007 (Kozulin et al., 2012);  \n\nThe logo of the reserve (Figure 3.7) has the Arctic Loon on it, only 2 pairs of this rare bird are \n\nencountered in the bog. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.7 Logo of the reserve (Je?nia reserve, 2014) \n\n? International \u2013 Ramsar site established in 2002, Important Bird Area established in 1998, \n\nImportant botanical site established in 2005 (Kozulin et al., 2012). \n\n\n\n51 \n\n3.1.2.4 Area size and zoning \n\n \n\nAccording to Kozulin et al. (2012), Je?nia reserve has an area of 25301 ha (Figure 3.8).  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.8 Map of the bog (Viciebskbiker, 2014) \n\n \n\nThe bogs cover 66 % of the reserve area, 24 % - forested lands, 6 % - low forests and shrubs. \n\nIt is important to note that 50% of the reserve is covered with bogs which suffered from fires \n\n(Kozulin et al., 2012). See Table A5, Appendix on transformation of landscape types of the \n\nbog. \n\nThe land plots and water bodies of the reserve belong to the state: the user of land plots and \n\nwater bodies is Dzisna forestry entreprise (Mijory, Dzisna, Hiermanavi?y forestry sections), \n\nthe tenants are \u0160arka\u00fa\u0161?yna and Mijory district divisions of the Belarusian Society of Hunters \n\nand Fishermen, Absterna Ltd (Figures A19, Appendix; Kozulin et al., 2012). \n\n \n\n3.1.2.5 Natural Values of Je?nia peatbog \n\n \n\nFirst of all, Je?nia is one of the largest near-natural raised bogs in Europe (views of the \n\nbog are on Figure A25, Appendix).  \n\n\n\n52 \n\nSecond, the bog is an important stop-over site for semi-aquatic bird species, such as Cranes \n\n(around 4000) and Geese (9000-12000 annually) (Figure A21-A22, Appendix), globally \n\nthreatened species of Lesser White-fronted Goose Anser erythropus breeds here (40-50 pairs \n\nin Europe), only 2 pairs of Arctic Loon Gavia arctica (Figure A23, Appendix) (Kozulin et al., \n\n2012).  \n\nThe bog is an IBA due to 150-200 pairs of Black Grouse Tetrao tetrix, 60 pairs of Common \n\nCrane Grus grus, and 50 pairs of Short-Eared Owl Asio flammeus (Kozulin et al., 2012). \n\nWhat is more, Je?nia is known for its unique paludal plant communities of a south taiga type \n\n(upland oak communities, ash, linden formations, old aspen and alder formations, open bogs, \n\ncranberries and cowberries communities) and rare and endangered flora species (Dwarf Birch \n\nBetula nana, Small-fruited Cranberry Oxicoccus microcarpus, Blushing Bog-moss Sphagnum \n\nmolle, Cloudberry Rubus chamaemorus, Swamp Willow Salix myrtilloides etc.) (Kozulin et \n\nal., 2012). \n\nFlora is dominated by 11 species of Sphagnum and Common Sundew Drosera rotundifolia \n\n(Figure A24, Appendix), and now well spread \u201cthanks\u201d to the drainage species of Birch \n\nBetula sp, Willow Salix sp, Sheathed Cottonsedge Eriophorum vaginatum, Common Heather \n\nCalluna vulgaris (Kozulin et al., 2012).  \n\nCommon Cranberry Oxycoccus palustris has seriously suffered as a result of forest fires but \n\nnow is regenerating. \n\nFauna: \n\n? 31 mammal species, Wild Boar Sus scrofa, Eurasian Elk Alces alces, European Red Fox \n\nVulpes vulpes, European Otter Lutra lutra, European Beaver Castor fiber, European Badger \n\nMeles meles, European Hare Lepus europaeus, Short-tailed Weasel Mustella erminea, \n\nRaccoon dog Nyctereutes procyonoides, Snow Hare Lepus timidus; \n\n? 150 bird species, nesting site for Arctic Loon Gavia arctica, Willow Grouse Lagopus \n\nlagopus (Figure A26, Appendix), European Golden Plover Pluvialis apricaria, Jack Snipe \n\nLymnocryptes minimus, Whimbrel Numenius phaeopus, Common Greenshank Tringa \n\nnebularia, Black Stork Ciconia nigra, White-Tailed Eagle Haliaeetus albicilla, Short-toed \n\nSnake-eagle Circaetus gallicus, Black Kite Milvus Migrans, Osprey Pandion haliaetus, \n\nGolden Eagle Aquila chrysaetos, Lesser Spotted Eagle Aquila pomarina; \n\n? 5 reptile species, large population of Common European Viper Vipera berus (Figure A27, \n\nAppendix); \n\n? 7 amphibian species (Kozulin et al., 2012). \n\n \n\n\n\n53 \n\n3.1.2.6 Current state: threats \n\n \n\nThere can be indicated the following disturbing factors which currently act as threats to the \n\nbog; \n\n? unregulated harvesting of wild berries and mushrooms as a disturbance factor; \n\n? intensive hunting and fishing: hunting for waterfowl species is prohibited during spring \n\nnesting and breeding season, but during the rest of the year the birds are disturbed; \n\nRecently there has been made a series of photos compiled in one Facebook post on fishing \n\nattractiveness in the reserve. It could be more efficient to promote the site from the point of \n\nview of unique biodiversity; \n\n? unsustainable forest management \u2013 cutting of indigenous communities of pines, fir-trees, \n\ntheir replacement by birches and willows; \n\n? use of cross-country vehicles which destroy vegetation and upper layer delicate peat soils; \n\n? local pollution with household waste from the nearby villages. \n\nViews of the bog are shown on Figure 3.9. \n\n \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.9 Views of the bog (Malashevich, 2014b) \n\n \n\n3.1.2.7 Management: past and present \n\n \n\nManagement of the reserve is a responisiblity of the Je?nia nature conservation state enterprise \n\ncreated in 2006 with a team of 3 people, \u0160arka\u00fa\u0161?yna and Mijory district executive \n\ncommittees who work in cooperation with various nature conservation entities (Kozulin et al., \n\n2012; Malashevich, 2013-2014). \n\nThe first Management Plan was developed in 2008 for a 5-year period by the National \n\nAcademy of Sciences of Belarus (Kozulin, 2008). The current Management Plan is for 2012-\n\n2016 (Kozulin et al., 2012). \n\nMain priorities of the plan are as follows (Kozulin et al., 2012): \n\n? restoration of hydrological regime of the bog; \n\n? organization of forest management aimed at biodiversity conservation; \n\n? preparation of recommendations on optimizing amateur fishing in the reserve to minimize \n\nthe impact of the disturbance factor on nesting birds; \n\n? organization of ecological tourism and environmental education: developing tours of the \n\nreserve and surrounding areas taking into account biodiversity inventory data; developing and \n\nbuilding special causeways for mechanical vehicles (cross-country vehicles) for tourist and \n\nother (scientific, fire fighting, and monitoring) purposes; creating the infrastructure for \n\necotourism development; \n\n? organize an awareness-raising campaign to inform the population about the nature \n\nconservation value of the reserve, its conservation and use regimes; \n\n\n\n55 \n\n? preparation of proposals on organizing sustainable use of the major bog resource, i.e. \n\ncranberries, and its processing in the district; \n\n? putting in place a system of monitoring water levels and quality on the territory of the \n\nreserve, its flora and plant communities, biotopes, bird population, and entomofauna to assess \n\nthe status of bog ecosystems and efficiency of the Management Plan implementation. \n\n \n\nConservation aspect \n\n \n\nScientific research on the Je?nia bog has been conducted for the last 20 years by various \n\ninstitutions. Since 1999 there have been a number of conservation projects on dam \n\nconstruction implemented in the reserve.  \n\n? Restoration of hydrological regime of the Je?nia peatbog (1992-2002, 2008-2012) \n\n(GEF-SGP, 2008c) - construction of 48 dams (Levy, 2010) on the drainage canals which \n\nallowed to raise groundwater level, stimulate conditions for restoration of native flora/fauna, \n\nprevent the bog from fires, and even stop decrease of Black Grouse populations. The project \n\nwas implemented with the help of foreign and Belarusian volunteers, local community \n\nmembers during \u201cLet\u2019s save Je?nia together\u201d volunteer camps organized for this objective, \n\nand by Mijory construction service. Simple design and local materials (burnt tree trunks, peat) \n\nhave been used for construction which made the process easy and low-cost (Figures A28-\n\nA30, Appendix; Shajkin and Levy, 2010). First, in 1999-2002, 17 dams were constructed in \n\nthe peripheral part of the bog which still could not decrease the water level in the centre of the \n\nbog. In 2007-2009 the dams were built in the central part to block the canals there (Levy, \n\n2010). \n\nWhat is more, several sensors for measurement of groundwater level, water quality \n\ncharacteristics (mineralization, temperature, acidity, dissolved oxygen) have been located in \n\nthe bog and provide a lot of useful information for monitoring its regime (Tanavickaja, \n\n2012a). \n\nThe constructed dams have been checked for their efficiency in spring 2012 (Tanavickaja, \n\n2012a). The process of bog restoration is very slow and needs time. There are already positive \n\nresults of the dam construction judging by the survey of all the dams functioning conducted in \n\nMay 2012: \n\n? canals have started covering with Sphagnum moss; \n\n? water has started accumulating and its level has raised 30-50 cm up; \n\n? 40 dams carry out their function to greater or lesser extent; \n\n\n\n56 \n\n? 8 dams have been damaged or formed new watercourses (Tanavickaja, 2012a). \n\nAs a result of a more than 10-year experience of dam construction on the Je?nia bog and the \n\nlatest analysis of dams there were made the following conclusions on the construction \n\ntechniques that could be used in the future (Tanavickaja, 2012a): \n\n? dams should be constructed so that their level could be 30 cm higher than maximum \n\nlevel of spring floods; \n\n? managed wrapping should be planned so that washout of additional watercourse is \n\nprevented; \n\n? planning of soil dams built with excavators so that runoff is completely blocked; \n\n? monitoring of the restoration processes is needed, the main expected effects are \n\nSphagnum moss growth along the canals, peat adaptation to natural conditions again \n\nand restoration of its CO2 accumulation function. \n\n? Support to the development of a comprehensive framework for international \n\nenvironmental cooperation in the Republic of Belarus (2011-2014): \n\n? the management plan of 2008 was reviewed and updated in 2012, mainly in the \n\nsection concerning the hydrological regime restoration; \n\n? habitat analysis was conducted and new habitats of rare species found;  \n\n? in May 2012 the reserve was supplied with cross-country vehicles, water monitoring \n\nset for inspecting of the bog and monitoring of its hydrological regime, fauna and flora \n\n(Figure A31, Appendix; UNDP, 2013). \n\n? Je?nia Caretakers\u2019 network \n\nJe?nia Caretakers\u2019 network was planned to be for monitoring the changes brought about by the \n\ndam construction, evaluating state of the dams, watching the activities carried out in the \n\nreserve with the aim of reporting in case of illegal hunting, fishing, or other negative human \n\nactions. Seminars and workshops were developed for the caretakers so that they could be \n\nwell-informed about the current environmental legislation, strategies and plans for nature \n\nconservation field in Belarus. \n\nAccording to UNDP, 2014, the caretakers of the Je?nia mire participate in the restoration of \n\nhydrological regime of the mire, monitor the state of dams and if necessary perform their \n\nroutine repairs. Not less than a half of volunteers, engaged in construction of dams, are local \n\ncitizens. In addition to that, 6 caretakers from Mijory and \u0160arka?\u0161?yna districts have become \n\npublic inspectors, which has institutionalized their connection with territorial bodies \n\n(Inspections) of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection. \n\n\n\n57 \n\nThe initiatives supported by the caretakers on the Je?nia bog are annual counts of Common \n\nCrane, dam construction (APB, 2014), installation of information boards in the reserve \n\n(Figure A32, Appendix; APB, 2010a), assigning public inspectors for nature conservation \n\nfrom the caretakers\u2019 network (APB, 2010b), cooperation with the reserve administration in \n\nreporting about threats and illegal actions. \n\n? Counts of Black Grouse and Willow Grouse in 2012 (Lundyshev, 2012) \n\nCounts (166-469 Black Grouse and 85 Willow Grouse) and analysis of these 2 species \n\ndistribution in the Je?nia bog have shown that they both face a number of problems caused \n\nboth by the change in the hydrological regime of the bog and by unregulated human activities \n\n(fishing): the species of Raccoon dog and Red Fox have decreased their population, \n\ndisturbance of the birds in the period of cranberries harvest and fishing activities with dogs, \n\nwinters without snow and Willow Grouse deaths due to this factor. \n\n \n\nDevelopment aspect \n\n \n\nFrom the point of view of ecotourism potential Je?nia bog has a limited access for tourists \n\n(bad roads, few villages and cities nearby, forests difficult to access, areas suffered from fires) \n\nand a low level of maximum acceptable concentration of visitors since bog landscape \n\nconservation requires regulation of disturbance level. Thus, ecotourism activities in the \n\nreserve can not be aimed at mass tourism. Fortunately, ecotourism itself is a concept which \n\nrequires limited number of tourist visits. The reserve has gone through successful \n\nimprovements in ecotourism development, thanks to the EU/UNDP project and the festival \n\n\u201cCranes and cranberries of Mijory land\u201d (UNDP, 2013) organized in 2012. All these factors \n\nincreased the visitors interest in the reserve. Accommodation services in the Mijory city and \n\nagricultural farmsteads have seen a rise in their profits. \n\nThe number of visitors of the reserve in 2008-2014 is shown in Table 3.2. \n\nTable 3.2 Number of visitors of the Je?nia reserve in 2008-2013 (Borok, 2012-2014) \n \n\nNumber of \n\nvisitors \n\n2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014  \n\njan-april \n\nBelarusian 78 60 53 65 76 289 202 \n\nForeign 22 14 15 2 10 62 17 \n\nTotal 100 74 68 67 86 351 219 \n\n\n\n58 \n\nThe numbers show the ongoing rise of the reserve popularity among both Belarusian and \n\nforeign tourists. Two big tourist groups from Germany and Finland visited the reserve in \n\n2013.  \n\nAccording to Dobrovolskij and Markevich, 2013, within the project on Support to the \n\ndevelopment of a comprehensive framework for international environmental \n\ncooperation in the Republic of Belarus (2011-2013) there have been completed the \n\nfollowing tasks in the area of ecotourism development: \n\n? ecological visit-centre in the reserve opened in September 2013, its specific feature is its \n\ndistant location from the bog itself which requires proper planning of its functions for visitors: \n\ninteractive information boards are set in the centre, in Belarusian, English and Russian \n\n(Figures A34-A35, Appendix); \n\n? tourist equipment has been provided: tents, sleeping bags, boats, bikes, skis, snowshoes, \n\nbinoculars, compasses, it all can be rented at a very low price; \n\n? ecological trail Aziera\u00faki started to be constructed and equipped for tourists: 1.5 km, a \n\npedestrian trail with a wooden flooring, 2 hours\u2019 walk, mostly through the bog (Figure A36, \n\nAppendix);  \n\nSo far, 500 m of the trail has been constructed (Natural Pearls, 2013a); \n\n? information boards provided, observation point and observation platforms constructed \n\n(Figures A37-A38, Appendix); \n\n? promotional videos have been shot in English, Belarusian and Russian (Chapter 3.1.2, \n\nAppendix); \n\n? there has been efficient promotion of the reserve on its Facebook page: descriptive photos \n\nare placed there regularly (Je?nia, 2014); \n\n? as Matvejeva, 2013 states, starting from September 2012, there has been annualy organized \n\nan ecological festival called \u201cCranes and cranberries of Mijory land\u201d which concentrates on \n\nculinary part of various dishes based on cranberries, traditionally collected in the area (drinks, \n\npastry, sausages). Observations of migrating Cranes are also carried out during the festival. \n\nThe festival became a good promotional event for the reserve (Figure A39, Appendix); \n\n? ecological festivals, seminars held regularly and devoted to various events, e.g. World \n\nWetlands Day 2014 festival fo school pupils, Felting souvenirs seminar (Natural Pearls, \n\n2013b; Je?nia reserve, 2014); \n\n\n\n59 \n\n? starting from 2013 one agricultural farmstead near the reserve offers photo shooting of the \n\nCommon Crane Grus Grus from specially equipped hiding places (Figure A40, Appendix; \n\nKozlovskij, 2013); \n\n? there was developed a business-plan of the new company on collecting and processing of \n\nwild berries and mushrooms (mainly cranberries, blueberries, and mushrooms), the company \n\ncalled Mijorskija jahady (Mijory berries) was registered in October 2012: aimed at sustainable \n\nuse of local resources by involving local people and getting economic profit from abundant \n\nlocal resources. \n\nAmong the tourist facilities of the reserve the following ones can be noted: \n\n? in May 2013 there was tested a new service of \u201cThrough the bog on snowshoes\u201d: \n\nsnowshoes are an equipment for the bog visit, there is a possibility of excursions prebooking \n\nand participation in planned visits (Figure A41, Appendix; Natural Pearls, 2013c); \n\n? guide services, prebooked, cost 1 euro per person per hour for Belarusian tourists, and 2.5 \n\neuros for foreigners. Excursions can be pedestrian (along the trail), on the snowshoes, skis \n\n(Natural Pearls, 2014); \n\n? 5 enthomological routes developed in the reserve (Natural Pearls, 2014); \n\n? there are recommendations of RSPB specialists on organization of school excursions and \n\nvisitor groups division (Chapter 3.1.2, Appendix; Cooper, 2012); \n\n? accommodation is not provided by the reserve but there are good options of \n\naccommodation in the city of Mijory (2 hotels), Dzisna (1 hotel), however, they are located \n\nfar from the destination, catering is not provided on a regular basis, the restaurants and cafes \n\nmay be closed at the time of arrival;  \n\n? there is a web-page of the reserve on the web-site of Viciebsk region reserves, both in \n\nRussian and in English, but the English version is incomplete; \n\n? there is a possibility for foreign tourists to find the reserve on the Internet (English version \n\nof the news, Facebook page). \n\nEnvironmental education is also a priority for the Je?nia reserve: organization of key events \n\nfor adults and schoolers \u2013 International Migratory Bird Day, the above mentioned festival \n\nCranes and Cranberries of Mijory land, World Wetlands Day (Natural Pearls, 2013b); \n\nThus, there are many positive trends about the reserve activities, whereas, there are negative \n\naspects \u2013 possibility of all the activities being at stake after the end of the funding project, \n\ninsufficient promotion of the site among national ad international tourists, lack of \n\ninfrastructure. \n\n\n\n60 \n\n3.1.2.8 What needs to be done and what is planned \n\n \n\nWhat needs to be done \n\n \n\nThe following measures need to be taken to improve the nature conservation and \n\necotourism/education performance of the Je?nia reserve: \n\n? promotion of the reserve both for Belarusian and foreign tourists. Although information \n\nabout the site is spread through the word of mouth in the birdwatching and nature \n\nconservation community, the reserve can be promoted among the general ecotourism travelers \n\non the Internet; \n\n? promotion through the commercial in English and a short movie since now they are not \n\neasily to find on the Internet; \n\n? plan of ecotourism development and plan of work with visitors needs to be developed; \n\n? a series of information boards have been developed, each devoted to a certain aspect: \n\nCranberry \u2013 bog berry, Dragonflies of the bog, Birds of the bog, Do you know trees, \n\nSphagnum and its characteristics. Judging by the design already planned, they seem to be very \n\nmodern from the point of view of environmental education. There are also planned interactive \n\ngames with both children and adults: Why we need bogs, Willow grouse and goshawk \n\n(Lundyshev, 2012); \n\n? there is a possibility and potential in combining Je?nia ecotourism resources and routes \n\nwith other protected areas (Braslavy Lakes, Bielavie\u017eskaja Pu\u0161?a) so that complex tours could \n\nbe possible. What is more, ecological tourism can be combined with cultural heritage of the \n\narea. \n\n \n\nWhat is planned \n\n \n\nThe future plans are listed below in Table 3.3, according to the current Management Plan \n\n2012-2016 and other sources (Kozulin et al., 2012; Je?nia reserve, 2014). \n\n \n\nTable 3.3 Plans of the reserve \n\nConservation  Development \n\ninstallation of man-made bird boxes and regulation \n\nof the number of certain species (Raccoon dog, \n\nAmerican mink) \n\nfinishing the Azera\u00faki ecological trail; \n\na second ecological trail to be constructed \n\nProject on fire prevention \u2013 construction of 20 \nartificial reservoirs is planned on the peripheral \n\nwebcams installation \u2013 live version of the reserve, \nshooting a movie as a result \n\n\n\n61 \n\npart of the bog so that water could be transported \n\nfast in case of fire, repairs of 60 km of roads, \n\nconstruction of 20 km of new ones (Mshar, 2012) \n\nadditional activities to restore the hydrological \n\nregime of the Je?nia bog \nimprovement of infrastructure for ecotourism \n\ndevelopment (tourist trails, watch towers, special \n\ncauseways, buying equipment, programs and a \n\npromotion plan) \n\nforest management by Dzisna Forestry Enterprise \nin accordance with the new Regulations on the \n\nJe?nia reserve \n\npreparing and publishing brochures, postcards, \n\nguidebooks, calendars, etc \n\n \n\nstart of the cranberry\u2019s company work installing signs giving directions and other \ninformation, billboards \n\nensuring sustainable hunting (regulating fall \n\nhunting at sites of day stop-over and feeding of \n\nmigratory birds, optimization of no-take zones) \n\norganization of tracking animals as ecotourism \n\nactivity \n\nsetting amateur fishing regimes at certain lakes  \n\npreparation of plant/animal habitat certificates and \n\ntransferring them to land users for conservation \n\n \n\ncomprehensive monitoring of the ecosystems  \n\n \n\n3.1.2.9 Water quality and peat analysis \n\n \n\nTha data and detailed results of thewater quality and peat analysis are located in Chapter \n\n3.1.2, Appendix. \n\nHydrochemical parameters are in the normal range typical of Belarusian bogs (low \n\nmineralization, low conductivity, strongly acidic). Water ph values are their highest limit. \n\nGroundwater levels have increased to normal levels on the edges of the bog and are gradually \n\nincreasing in the centre. \n\nPeat ph values are in the normal range for bogs (2.99). Von Post Decomposition Index is H1 \n\n(undecomposed peat) for the undisturbed parts of the bog, H4-H5 for the disturtbed ones \n\nwhich is still a normal result. \n\n \n\n3.1.2.10 Wetland condition analysis \n\n \n\nThe Table of evaluation is located in Appendix. The overall result obtained for the Je?nia bog \n\nis 19.67 out of 25 which is a rather high value showing the high percentage of natural bog \n\nareas and efficient work on restoration of the hydrological regime. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n62 \n\n3.1.3 Zvaniec mire \n\n \n\n3.1.3.1 Location \n\n \n\nZvaniec mire is the largest European mesotrophic fen mire, diversified by small mineral \n\nislands scattered over the area and covered by forests and shrubs. Located in southwestern \n\nBelarus, Brest region, Drahi?yn and Kobryn districts, 17 km south-east of Drahi?yn, to the \n\nsouth of the Dniapro-Buh canal, Black Sea basin (Figure 3.10). The site borders the Dniapro-\n\nBuh Canal (DBC) in the North, Bielaaziorsk Canal in the East, bypass canals of the \n\nArecha\u00faski and Krasny Partyzan agricultural entreprises\u2019 drainage systems in the South, \n\nArecha\u00faski Canal in the West (NAS, 2009b). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.10 Location of Zvaniec mire (Google Earth; Malashevich, 2014a) \n\n \n\n\n\n63 \n\n3.1.3.2 History and present main features \n\n \n\nAs NAS, 2009b states, Zvaniec mire, lake-alluvial plain, part of Palie?sie lowland, started to \n\nform 4.5 thousand years ago as a result of melting of the Dniepr glacier and erosion processes \n\ncaused by icy water flows. The resulting depression was getting filled with water. Further \n\nwarming up of the climate made sedimentation with silty and sandy matter a regular process. \n\nGlacier retreat caused water outflow, the former lake was gradually getting filled with rich \n\nmatter brought by rivers from the plain, its size was shrinking and it continued its existence \n\nonly as a waterlogged plain. Thanks to closeness and abundance of groundwater layer, \n\nwaterlogging and peat accumulation started in the deepest depressions, the area covering with \n\nhypnum moss, reeds and sedge peat. Peat layer at present is 0.5-1 m. \n\nThus there existed so called Hala\u00fa\u0161?yckaje mire, a vast waterlogged complex. Zvaniec was \n\nthe eastern part of that complex. During 1960-80 drainage campaigns most fens were drained \n\nfor agricultural purposes, forestry and peat extraction. Only six large fens were left in natural \n\nstate in Europe. Zvaniec is the largest of them.  \n\nAccording to NAS, 2009b, Zvaniec mire is located in the interfluve of the Dniapro-Buh Canal \n\n(DBC), constructed in 1775-1783 and its tributaries, Bielaaziorsk and Arecha\u00faski Canals, \n\nconstructed in the beginning of the 20\nth\n\n century for navigation purposes. In the 18\nth\n\n century \n\nthe DBC was used only during spring floods, only later in 1837-1867 the regulation dams \n\nwere constructed. All the canals seriously changed the regime of the mire. \n\nThe main recharge source of the mire is ground water. Atmospheric recharge is significant \n\nonly in autumn and spring. \n\nThe surface flow is directed both to the east and to the west. The northern part of the mire is \n\npartly drained by DBC. The hydrological regime of the area is also influenced by \n\namelioration polder systems (7) and drainage canals, and fishfarm Navasiolki. Central and \n\nsouthern parts are least disturbed (NAS, 2009b). \n\nAlmost annually the summer and fall no-flood period is interrupted by rainfall floods. The \n\nheight and duration of summer floods are significantly lower than the same parameters of the \n\nspring floods. However, in some years (1984, 1993) the summer rain flood water levels \n\nsurpassed those of the spring melt floods (NAS, 2009b). \n\nIn especially dry years the groundwater table can drop up to 0.5 m below surface (NAS, \n\n2009b). As it was noted above the hydrological regime of the mire is influenced by \n\namelioration polder systems, drainage canals and ditches. Their exploitation defines the \n\ngroundwater table on the mire. Incorrect operation of the polders and drainage canals often \n\n\n\n64 \n\nresults in unexpected inundations, draughts, and catastrophic fires on the site causing \n\nsignificant damages to the biological diversity. \n\nOpen sedge fen parts of the mire are natural habitats for many species under minimal \n\nanthropogenic pressure. They can serve as reference mires in planning for management of \n\nfens, as well as for rehabilitation of wetlands. \n\n \n\n3.1.3.3 Protection regimes \n\n \n\nZvaniec mire has the following national and international protection statuses: \n\n? National \u2013 Republican Landscape Reserve established in 1996 (NAS, 2009b); \n\nLogo of the reserve shows the Aquatic Warbler  as a key species for the site (Figure 3.11). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.11 Logo of the reserve (Malashevich, 2014a) \n\n? International \u2013 Ramsar site established in 2002, Important Botanical Site (1998), \n\nImportant Bird Area (2005) (NAS, 2009b). \n\n \n\n3.2.3.4 Area size and zoning \n\n \n\nAccordin to NAS, 2009b, the total area of Zvaniec reserve is 16 227 ha. Open fens dominate \n\nthe area covering 77.4 % of the reserve. The area of forests and shrubs, which are mainly \n\nfound on the mineral islands, is 18.1 %. Agricultural lands \u2013 2.1 % - parts of the islands used \n\nfor ploughing (159 ha), mowing (47 ha), and pastures (147 ha). 0.2 % of the reserve is \n\ncovered with water (see Table A6, Appendix). It is important to note that open fen areas has \n\ndecreased by 11% since 1955 (Malashevich et al., 2008). \n\nDepending on the landscape features, geographic location, level and type of anthropogenic \n\nload the area can be divided into several parts: the western part, the central and the southern \n\npart together, the northern and the eastern parts (Figure 3.12). \n\n \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.12 Map of the Zvaniec mire (Malashevich et al., 2008) \n\n \n\nThe western part is characterized by abundance of mineral islands with sedge fen mires \n\novergrown with shrubs. The islands are characterized by high degree of transformation due to \n\npast arable farming activities.  \n\nThe central and southern parts of the mire are dominated by open fen mires with shrubs \n\ncovering about 10-30% (NAS, 2009b). Mineral islands are scattered all over the mire \n\ncomplex, but their area is small (0.2 to 1 ha) (NAS, 2009b). Mineral islands in this part of the \n\nmire are the least transformed as they were used by people only as hay-making fields. These \n\nsmall mineral islands are used by a number of rare bird species for nesting. \n\nMineral islands dominate in the eastern part of the site. Natural forest vegetation here forms \n\nnarrow strips along the slopes of the islands. Most of the island area was used for arable \n\nfarming by local population, mainly to grow potatoes. Fen mires located between the islands \n\nare severely overgrown with shrubs. Here the largest Zvaniec island is located, alsmot fully \n\ncovered with forests. \n\nThe northern part of the site is greatly impacted by the presence of the DBC. The share of \n\nopen fens here is the lowest. Willow shrub proportion is the highest here, the area being \n\n\n\n66 \n\nstrongly waterlogged.  Most of the islands in this part were previously used for ploughing and \n\nhay-making. \n\nOpen water surfaces are represented by one lake and a network of canals and ditches. The site \n\nis owned by the state. As it can be seen on Figure A42, Appendix, most part of the site\u2019s lands \n\nis not used (83%). The land is leased to Radasto\u00faski agricultural entreprise and Drahi?yn \n\nforestry (12% of the site) (NAS, 2009b).  \n\n \n\n3.2.3.5 Natural Values of Zvaniec mire \n\n \n\nZvaniec mire is characterized by the following features that confirm its uniqueness and \n\nbiodiversity richness: \n\n? a particularly good representative example of sedge-hypnum fen mires typical of the \n\nPalie?sie biogeographic district; \n\n? hosts 2 globally threatened species of birds \u2013 at least 2 pairs of Greater Spotted Eagle \n\nAquila clanga, and the largest population of the Aquatic Warbler Acrocephalus paludicola \n\n(3000-5500 singing males, 30 % of the European population) (NAS, 2009b; Malashevich, \n\n2013); \n\n? the site is a \"hotspot\" for conservation of biological diversity of Eastern Europe \n\nbiogeographic region. It supports particular elements of biological diversity (species, habitat \n\ntypes) of fen mires. The Zvaniec mire contains a significant proportion of species adapted to \n\nspecial environmental condition (mesotrophic open fen mire) (NAS, 2009b): \n\n29 plant species were discovered to be rare and disappearing within the region  of Palie?sie; \n\n10 vegetation communities formerly widespread across Palie?sie fen mires, now rare for \n\nBelarus and Europe, are found here. \n\nBird species composition of Zvanec is not very rich but includes some typical fen mire \n\nspecies (125): Greater Bittern Botaurus stellaris, Short-toed Eagle Circaetus gallicus, Lesser \n\nSpotted Eagle Aquila pomarina, Greater Spotted Eagle Aquila clanga, Common Kestrel \n\nFalco tinnunculus, Hobby Falco subbuteo, Little Crake Porzana parva, Crane Grus grus, \n\nCurlew Numenius arquata, Short-eared Owl Asio flammeus, Savi's Warbler Locustella \n\nluscinioides, Aquatic Warbler Acrocephalus paludicola, Penduline Tit Remiz pendulinus, \n\nGreat Grey Shrike Lanius excubitor; \n\n? 29 mammal species, including 2 Red Data Book Species \u2013 European Badger Meles Meles, \n\nEurasian Lynx Felis linx; \n\n\n\n67 \n\n? 9 amphibian species, dominating Moor Frog Rana arvalis; \n\n? 5 reptile species, rare species of the European Pond Turtle Emys orbicularis (NAS, 2009b). \n\n*Social and cultural value of the Zvaniec mire \n\nDespite their negative influence on the mire, the Dniapro-Buh Canal (DBC) and the \n\nBelaaziorsk Canal represent certain historic value. \n\nAccording to NAS, 2009b, the DBC was constructed in 1775-1783, the Bielaaziorsk Canal in \n\n1905-1910. Ancient embanking facilities from oak, and parts of old sluices have remained on \n\nsome parts of the canals. These are examples of hydrotechnical facilities dated late 19 \u2013 early \n\n20th century. \n\nWhat is more, some of the existing economic activities are also a part of the traditional \n\nculture. Up to the late 1950s there were many so-called one-house villages on mineral islands \n\nin the western and southern part of the now protected area. At present there are practically no \n\nsuch villages on the site, but arable farming on mineral islands for domestic purposes is \n\nsometimes practiced by the inheritors of the former land-owners. Horticulture is another \n\ntraditional type of economic activities. Bee-houses were mounted on large ancient oaks, the \n\nlatter representing significant historic, esthetic, and scientific value. \n\nWhat is more, historic and ethnographic sites are also found close to the site. Jamnik village, \n\nespecially its southern part has retained almost all historic features typical for the Palie?sie \n\nregion: reed-roofs, traditional hedges, shadoofs, nests of white storks on old trees and house \n\nroofs (NAS, 2009b). \n\n \n\n3.1.3.6 Current state: threats \n\n \n\nThere can be indicated the following disturbing factors which currently act as threats to the \n\nmire: \n\n? Exploitation of the adjacent amelioration systems. The amelioration systems are all \n\ndrainage polder-type systems, i.e. they are separated from the external catchment by \n\nembankments. Excess water is pumped out of the polders by pump stations and is supplied to \n\nthe ditches which form the southern boundary of the Zvaniec mire. When in operation, the \n\npump stations of these systems lead to the excessive waterlogging of the mire and high \n\namount of nutrients from agricultural fields (UN, 2002); \n\nAmelioration systems: some of them in need of repairs, some do not function, the other ones \n\nstill influence the water regime of Zvaniec causing either inundations in the south (during \n\n\n\n68 \n\nsummer floods and water inflow from the canals) or droughts (too rapid water outflow after \n\nspring floods); \n\n? As a consequence of the first factor, speeding up of the vegetation succession - mire \n\ntracts with a lowered groundwater table have higher cover of reeds which results in changes \n\nin the species composition of plants and animals. The tracts with a lowered groundwater table \n\n(especially close to the boundaries of the mire) are characterized by spread of shrubs and \n\nforests. \n\nEvidence of the above indicated threats and general views of the mire can be seen on Figure \n\n3.13. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n69 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.13 Views of the mire (Malashevich, 2014b) \n\n? Disruption of hydrological regime of the mire \u2013 elevation or decline of the \n\ngroundwater level. The main reason for that \u2013 lack of coordination of the rules and \n\nprocedures for exploitation of the Dniepr-Buh canal with the need for conservation of the \n\nZvaniec mire. Fortunately, now all the canals of water outflow into the Dniepr-Buh canal are \n\nclosed, thus, do not influence the area any more; \n\n? Abandonment of traditional land use. Recent decades have seen a rapid decline in the \n\namount of haymaking on the mire. Some 20 years ago, about 70% of the mire was mown by \n\nthe local population. Today less than 10% of the mire is cut: most hay-making is now \n\nperformed on more accessible fields which emerged as a result of drainage. Hence, many mire \n\ntracts get overgrown with shrubs and reeds (NAS, 2009b); \n\n? Forest logging. The islands were formerly occupied by nemoral oak forests, which created \na positive environment for a number of rare plants and served as breeding sites for many birds \n\n\n\n70 \n\nof prey. Nowadays, the islands have retained only scattered fragments of those forests. Forest \n\nlogging continues to negatively impact the mire because most of the mire\u2019s forests are under \n\njurisdiction of agricultural enterprises, which use forests without limitations, that would be \n\nimpossible if the forests, for example, were under the jurisdiction of forestries; \n\n? Biological pollution. This is present on all mineral islands of the mire and in many of the \n\nforests in the north of the site. This is in most cases related to the dissemination of weeds and \n\nforest-steppe species imported from numerous agricultural fields and pastures located of the \n\nmineral islands representing a threat to local flora; \n\n? Use of poisonous seeds. The use of poisonous seeds on fields adjoining the site has \n\nfrequently resulted in mass killing of black grouses, partridges and cranes, the latter species \n\nbeing a nationally protected one; \n\n? Climate change. Changes in the amount of winter precipitation in the last years have \n\nresulted in years with either no spring floods or \u2013 the opposite \u2013 with a very high spring \n\nfloods. Summer rainfall floods have also become more frequent. Absence of flood or \n\nprolonged inundation of the floodplain during the vegetation season results in serious changes \n\nin the \u201coperational mechanics\u201d of the mire ecosystem, exemplified by temporary \n\nreplacements of vegetation associations, changes in species composition, distribution and \n\ndensity of birds, flooding of nests and as a result mass killing of nestlings; \n\n? Operation of the Navasiolki fish-farm. The Navasiolki fish-farm is located in the \n\nnorthern part of the mire. It is supplied from the DBC, but the recharge is also partly carried \n\nout with water pumped out of the mire (UN, 2002). \n\n \n\n3.1.3.7 Management: past and present \n\n \n\nManagement of the reserve is carried out by the state nature conservation entreprise  Zvaniec \n\nRepublican Biological Reserve with a team of 5 people, and Drahi?yn and Kobryn district \n\nexecutive committes (NAS, 2009b) in cooperation with APB-Birdlife Belarus. \n\nLands of Drahi?yn forestry are use as follows: arable farming is conducted on 94 ha, 36 ha are \n\nused for hay-making, 149 ha for cattle pasturing (NAS, 2009b).  \n\nMineral islands are partially used by the local population for ploughing and subsequent \n\ngrowing of arable crops, mainly potatoes. The western part of the mire is used most \n\nintensively. This part has not yet been included in the protected area. The eastern part of the \n\nmire adjoining the Bielaaziorsk Canal is also used quite intensively. \n\n\n\n71 \n\nThe area of the mire is also used as a large reservoir to store water pumped out of the \n\nameliorated (poldered) areas in rainy periods and supply water for drained tracts during dry \n\nperiods. Large canals are used by local population for non-commercial fishing. \n\nHorticulture has always been popular among local population and the traditions of this \n\nhousehold craft are still alive here. However, the actively used areas cover only 12% of the \n\nreserve (NAS, 2009b). \n\nIn 2001 a management plan for the Zvaniec reserve was elaborated in the framework of an \n\ninternational project on Management Planning for Key Fen Mire Biodiversity in Belarus. It \n\nwas further implemented (NAS, 2009b). The present Management Plan is for 2009-2013. Its \n\nmain priorities were set as follows (NAS, 2009b): \n\n? hydrological regime management and vegetation management \u2013 mowing, vegetation use \n\nfor briquette production, managed vegetation burning; \n\n? review and update of borders and regimes of use of the reserve with the area extension to \n\n16227 ha and increase in the number of land users; \n\n? ecotourism organization and sustainable development \u2013 repairs and opening of an \n\ninformation centre, ecological trail and observation point construction, website development, \n\nbusiness plan on promotion of Zvaniec within the domestic and inbound tourism market; \n\n? establishment of a hunting unit in order to manage the hunting activities and reduce the \n\nnumber of poaching cases; \n\n? environmental education, cooperation with local people. \n\n \n\nConservation aspect \n\n \n\nKozulin and Flade (1999) state that scientific surveys of the site started in the 1950s. In 1995\u2013\n\n1997 a study of the distribution and ecology of the Aquatic Warbler in Belarus was carried \n\nout, assisted by the Michel Otto Foundation (Germany) and the Royal Society for the \n\nProtection of Birds (UK). The study discovered that the Zvaniec mire supported the world\u2019s \n\nlargest populations of this bird. Thus, the research outcome clearly indicated a need for a \n\nManagement Plan for this area. \n\nAccording to Ramsar (2002) in 1997, a permanent monitoring plot was established in the \n\nsouthern part of Zvaniec, enabling annual studies of the dynamics of the mire flora and fauna. \n\nIn 2001\u20132002 a number of projects on study and description of Zvaniec as a potential Ramsar \n\nsite were implemented, e.g. Number and Distribution of Snipe and Great Snipe; Social \n\n\n\n72 \n\nand Cultural Value of the Site; Study of Possibilities for Recreation and Tourism at the \n\nSite. \n\n? Management planning for conservation of fen mire biodiversity in Belarus (1999-\n\n2002) - development of Management Plan for Zvaniec fen mire (UNDP, 2002b); \n\n? Implementation of urgent recommendations of the management plans for key \n\nbiodiversity areas in Belarus (2002-2006) \u2013 setting of management administration of the \n\nreserve, hydrological regime stabilized (7 sluices constructed), monitoring of Aquatic Warbler \n\npopulation, ringing of Aquatic Warbler (UNDP, 2006b); \n\nAs a result of the 2003-2008 plan realization, the following conservation measures were taken \n\n(NAS, 2009b): \n\n? borders of the reserve changed and newly established; \n\n? all the canals of water outflow into the Dniapro-Buh canal are closed, thus, do not \n\ninfluence the area any more; \n\n? water regulation systems (sluices, dams) were constructed in 2004 in order to limit \n\nwater outflow through the canals and amelioration systems or its inflow during \n\nsummer floods. These systems proved their efficiency having caused increase in water \n\nlevel in the reserve and prevention from summer floods in the central part of the mire; \n\n? regulation dam was constructed in the area of Navasiolki fishfarm to decrease its \n\ninfluence on the reserve; \n\n? monitoring of groundwater levels has been conducted regularly. \n\n? Conserving unique biological diversity of lowland mires through their sustainable use \n\n(2006-2009) implemented by APB-Birdlife Belarus \u2013 vegetation management at the key \n\nAquatic Warbler breeding site \u2013 mowing and bush removal with tractors (GEF-SGP, 2006b); \n\n? Catalyzing sustainability of the wetland protected area system in Belarusian Palie?sie \n\nthrough increased management efficiency and realigned land use practices 2006-2011\u2013 \n\nimplementation of the Management Plan of the Zvaniec reserve, establishement of a cross-\n\nborder Ramsar site \u201cUpper Prypia?\u201d which includes Zvaniec and Prastyr (Belarus) and Upper \n\nPrypia? and Prypia?-Stochid (Ukraine), engineering project on optimisation of hydrological \n\nregime (UNDP, 2006a; 2010a; 2011a); \n\n? Aquatic Warbler monitoring in Belarus project (2002 \u2013 up to now) \u2013 annual Aquatic \n\nWarbler counts, monitoring of AW numbers and distribution, ringing (Malashevich, 2012), \n\nthe project is described in Chapter 3.1.4; \n\n\n\n73 \n\n? Zvaniec Caretakers\u2019 Network. According to UNDP, 2014, at the Zvaniec mire the \n\ncaretakers monitor hydrological regime: take measurements of the ground water level and \n\nmonitor the overflow situation. One of the caretakers took active participation in the \n\ndevelopment of the project application for rewetting of drained peatland withdrawn from \n\nagriculture in the vicinity of the mire. By the caretakers\u2019 efforts the census of cranes is \n\norganized and performed at the Zvaniec mire annually. \n\n \n\nDevelopment aspect \n\n \n\nZvaniec reserve possesses the following ecotourism and environmental education facilities: \n\n? the information centre was opened in 2010 in the village of Haravica, Drahi?yn district, 7 \n\nplaces for accommodation of visitors, rental of bikes, tents etc (Figure A45, Appendix; \n\nTouristic Brest, 2014b). However, visit to the centre and the reserve requires prebooking, \n\notherwise, the visitors would face a closed office although it is officially open during all the \n\nweek except for the weekend. There are no routes developed for tourists, although the funding \n\nwas provided for that; \n\n? there is no web-site of the reserve, there is some information, not much of a tourist type, on \n\nthe web-sites of Brest tourism, Drahi?yn district; \n\n? the tourist routes along Bielaaziorsk and DB canals were developed for pedestrians and \n\nbike tours but not equipped so far (Figure A43, Appendix); \n\n? ecological education activities have been organized with the local pupils, school \n\nexcursions; \n\n? excursions for foreign groups are organized (1-2 per year); \n\n? meetings with locals are held sporadically. \n\nTable 3.4 demostrates low numbers of visitors in 2011-2013 which is an evidence of lack of \n\npromotion and infrastructure for visits. \n\nTable 3.4 The number of visitors of Zvaniec reserve, 2011-2013 (Malashevich, 2013-2014) \n\nNumber of visitors 2011 2012 2013 \n\nBelarusian 53 58 55 \n\nForeign 17 0 13 \n\nTotal 70 58 68 \n\n \n\n3.1.3.8 What needs to be done and what is planned \n\nWhat needs to be done  \n\n\n\n74 \n\nThe following measures need to be taken to improve the nature conservation and \n\necotourism/education performance of the reserve: \n\n? hydrological and vegetation management: further implementation of the regulation \n\nmeasures; \n\n? promotion of the reserve through mass media, Internet, social networks, events, provision \n\nof information for foreign visitors on the Internet; \n\n? installation of infoboards, direction signs, equipment of the tourist trails; \n\n? organization of environmental education activities; \n\n? collaboration with Sporava reserve on organizing joint excursions. \n\n \n\nWhat is planned \n\n \n\nAmong the plans of the reserve is the already launched Clima East project on Conservation \n\nand sustainable management of peatlands in Belarus to minimize carbon emissions and \n\nhelp ecosystems to adapt to climate change (2014-2020) \u2013 aimed at restoration of Zvaniec \n\nfen mire by mechanized mowing and collecting and use of biomass for fuel briquette \n\nproduction: purchase of 2 tractors and other equipment for mowing of 40% of the mire area. \n\nProcessing of biomass for briquette production (Sadovksaja, 2013). \n\n \n\n3.1.3.9 Peat analysis \n\n \n\nData and results of peat analysis are located in Chapter 3.1.3, Appendix. The ph values \n\nobtained are in the normal range for fen mires (5.73) and show that the peat in Zvaniec mire is \n\nweakly acidic which does not serve as any evidence of drainage consequences and \n\ndisturbance of hydrological regime of the mire. This means that the ecosystem has had the \n\nresources to protect itself and prevent severe degradation. \n\nVon Post Decomposition Index is H4 (weakly decomposed peat) which is a normal value. \n\n \n\n3.1.3.10 Wetland condition analysis \n \n\nThe Table of evaluation is located in Appendix. The overall result obtained for Zvaniec mire \n\nis 19.58 out of 25 which is a rather high value meaning that although the mire has suffered \n\nfrom drainage the big part of has remained weakly disturbed and the conservation activities \n\ncarried out are highly efficient. \n\n\n\n75 \n\n3.1.4 Aquaric Warbler conservation project \n\n \n\n3.1.4.1 Overview of Aquatic Warbler conservation concept \n\n \n\nThe Aquatic Warbler Acrocephalus paludicola is the rarest and the only globally threatened \n\npasserine bird found in mainland Europe. According to AWCT (2014); Birdlife (2014b), the \n\nspecies is classified as Vulnerable at the global level and is listed as Vulnerable in the IUCN \n\nRed List of Threatened Species. At the European level it is classified as Endangered. It is also \n\nincluded into Annex I of the EU Wild Birds Directive, in Appendix II of the Bern Convention \n\nand in Appendix I of the Bonn Convention. \n\nOnce widespread and numerous in fen mires and wet meadows throughout Europe, the \n\nAquatic Warbler has disappeared from most of its former range. As AWCT (2014) states, \n\nnowadays, its world population is confined to fewer than 40 regular sites in only six European \n\ncountries, with four sites supporting over 80 % of the global population (Poland, Belarus, \n\nUkraine, Lithuania). \n\n \n\nHistory of decline \n\n \n\nAccording to Birdlife (2014a), since 1970, the Aquatic Warbler species has declined \n\nsignificantly as a result of the destruction of 80-90% of its habitat in the river systems of the \n\nupper Prypia?, Jasie?da (Belarus) and Biebrza/Narew (Poland). These systems hold \n\napproximately 75% of the European population. It formerly bred in France, Belgium, \n\nNetherlands, former West Germany, former Czechoslovakia, former Yugoslavia, Austria and \n\nItaly. As Flade (2013) states, whereas the Central European population seems still to be more \n\nor less stable (probably increasing in East Poland, declining in Belarus, unknown in Ukraine), \n\nthe peripheral populations are threatened by extinction or have already disappeared. Whilst \n\nthe current status of the West Siberian population is unknown (latest breeding season records \n\nfrom the year 2000), the Hungarian population has completely vanished (700 males in 2001, \n\nno breeding occurrence after 2011). The Baltic population is steeply declining (from 290\u2013330 \n\nin 2004 to less than 100 males in 2013). The Pomeranian population is threatened by \n\nextinction: decline from c. 200 males in 1999 to c.100 males in 2006 to less than 20 in 2013. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n76 \n\nPopulation, breeding sites, migration routes \n\n \n\nAccording to Flade (2013), the global population size of the Aquatic Warbler (AW) is \n\nestimated at between 9 500 and 13 700 singing males during the period 2009\u20132013 and \n\nconfined to fewer than 40 sites in 5 countries.  \n\nAquatic Warbler distribution of male population among the countries is the following: Poland \n\n2,670-3,850; Belarus 2900-5500 (Kozulin and Malashevich, 2013); Ukraine 4,000-4,900 \n\n(Poluda, 2013); Lithuania cerca 100 (Flade, 2013), Germany, fewer than 25 (Birdlife, \n\n2014a). \n\nThus, the Aquatic Warbler regularly breeds in Belarus, Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, with \n\nmajor populations in Belarus, Ukraine, and Poland (AWCT, 2014).  \n\nIt breeds in large open lowland marsh habitats with low grassy vegetation (mostly sedge fen \n\nmires) with water mostly less than 10 cm deep. It winters in similar habitats (the grassy \n\nsaline marshes of the Senegal and Niger deltas) and, on migration, favours coastal habitats \n\nwith low stands of sedge and reed near open water (Portugal, France) (Birdlife, 2014a). \n\nOn migration, it has been recorded in 15 European countries, mainly in the west and \n\nsouthwest of the continent. It winters in the Sahelian belt of sub-Saharan West Africa, mainly \n\nalong the lower Senegal River, where it was discovered in January 2007, within and to the \n\nnorth of Djoudj National Park, and in 2011 found in smaller wetlands in south-west \n\nMauritania and at the inner Niger Delta in Mali. Two-thirds of the known population have \n\nbeen discovered since 1995 (Birdlife, 2014a). \n\n \n\nThreats \n\n \n\nAccording to Birdlife (2014a), the most important threats for the species are: \n\n? loss of breeding habitat owing to drainage for agriculture and peat extraction, damming of \n\nfloodplains, unfavourable water management and the canalisation of rivers. Habitat \n\ndegradation is widespread where traditional fen management has ceased allowing succession \n\nto unsuitable overgrown reedbed, shrub or woodland, decrease of the groundwater level; \n\n? uncontrolled fires in spring and summer pose a direct threat to birds and nests, since they \n\ncan burn out the upper peat layer of fens;  \n\n? in the wintering grounds, agricultural cultivation and irrigation (creation of rice and sugar \n\ncane plantations), drought, wetland drainage, intensive grazing, succession to scrub, \n\ndesertification and salinisation of irrigated soils are all existing threats. \n\n\n\n77 \n\nConservation policy \n\n \n\nAs Birdlife, 2014a states, Aquatic Warlber is legally protected in all countries of its breeding \n\nrange. All key breeding sites in Belarus, Germany and Poland are located within protected \n\nareas. Habitat is actively managed in Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, Lithuania and Germany. All \n\nbreeding range states except for Russia have monitoring programmes.  \n\nFirst, there exists the Birdlife International Aquatic Warbler Conservation Team which is \n\nresponsible for research, development and implementation of conservation actions and \n\ncooperation between the countries of the breeding range. \n\nAccording to CMS, 2014, the Aquatic Warbler Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was \n\nconcluded in Belarus, under the auspices of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) and \n\nbecame effective in 2003. The MOU applies to 22 countries where the Aquatic Warbler \n\nbreeds, rests on migration or winters. It calls for cooperation among national authorities to \n\npromote the conservation of the species and requires the strict protection of the species and \n\nthe maintenance and restoration of its habitat. \n\nMoreover, in 2010 there was adopted a new International Species Action Plan for the Aquatic \n\nWarbler, prepared by CMS\u2019s partner BirdLife International on behalf of the European Union. \n\nThe main objective of the Action Plan is to maintain the Aquatic Warbler throughout its range \n\nand, in the medium to long term, promote the expansion of the breeding population to other \n\nsuitable areas. Priority conservation actions to be taken by the Signatories can be summarized \n\nas follows: legislative measures to ensure the species\u2019 and habitat protection, conservation of \n\nall existing sites, increase of the area of suitable habitat at existing sites and restoration of \n\nadditional sites, monitoring and research, and the establishment of a public awareness strategy \n\n(CMS, 2014). \n\nThe following researches have been carried out in Europe and Africa recently: \n\n? the first wintering site discovered in 2007 in the Djoudj National Park in Northwest \n\nSenegal. Later on three more sites were discovered, they are located in southern Mauritania \n\nand in the Niger River delta in Mali (CMS, 2014): ringing of the species and data analysis; \n\n? habitat restoration has been conducted on the breeding grounds; \n\n? AW counts are held regularly in Belarus, Ukraine, Lithuania. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n78 \n\n3.1.4.2 Belarus \n\n \n\nKozulin and Flade, 1999 state that studies on Aquatic Warbler distribution in Belarus started \n\nin the 1990s by the joint international team hade by the German wetland scientist Martin \n\nFlade who came up with the idea to study Belarusian fen mires after he found one of his \n\nDad\u2019s photos during World War II which was shot in Belarus and showed the mire landscape. \n\nThe scientist decided there could be large numbers of Aquatic Warbler in Belarus if the mires \n\nwere in a good condition. It needed studying since in Germany the birds were in decline due \n\nto habitat destruction. \n\nSince then, lots of studies have been carried out, several projects developed and brought to \n\nlife by the conservation team of APB-Birdlife Belarus, German scientists with the financial \n\nsupport of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (UK), the Secretariat for the Bonn \n\nConvention (CMS) and the A.G. Leventis Foundation (Germany). \n\n \n\nKey breeding sites \n\n \n\nThe main Belarusian AW breeding sites are all located within the protected areas and are \n\nSporava fen mire, Dzikoje mire, and Zvaniec mire. \n\nAll the other regularly occupied breeding sites are under the protection regime (Figure 3.14). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.14 Location of the AW breeding sites in Belarus, 2013 (Malashevich, 2013) \n\n\n\n79 \n\nAccording to Kozulin and Malashevich, 2013, before the massive drainage of mires in the \n\n1960s, Aquatic Warbler was nearly continuously distributed in the central part of its breeding \n\nrange, in the Paliessian lowland. There were cerca 99 big fen mires (each of 1 000 ha and \n\nmore) covering a total area of more than 900 000 ha. The mires were either adjacent to each \n\nother, or were located in a distance of 20-40 km. For that period the number of Aquatic \n\nWarblers is estimated at about 450 000 singing males. \n\n \n\nConservation policy \n\n \n\nAccording to Malashevich and Fenchuk (2008), the AW conservation policy includes the \n\nfollowing aspects:  \n\n? maintaining existing habitats; \n\n? restoring abandoned habitats; \n\n? regular monitoring of AW numbers and distribution \u2013 Aquatic Warbler counts, ringing of \n\nthe birds, search for new sites. \n\n \n\nMonitoring of AW numbers and distribution: AW counts \n\n \n\nAW counts will be analysed on the basis of 2013 counts\u2019 results at 3 key breeding sites, and \n\nresults from the 2010-2013 results at some sites presented by Malashevich, 2013. \n\nIn general, the counts have been held regularly since 1995. Usually the key breeding sites \n\n(Zvaniec, Sporava and Dzikoje mires) were taken as the research sites. \n\nThe AW counts are carried out according to the international AW monitoring scheme \n\ndeveloped within the framework LIFE-Nature project (Poland and Germany). They are \n\norganized as volunteer camps for all the people interested.  \n\nThe counts start one hour before sunset and last for maximum 2 hours \u2013 the period of the \n\nhighest singing activity of males. This period is enough to cover a monitoring route up to 2 \n\nkm. Counts are usually not conducted in rainy or windy weather. \n\nCounts are simultaneously conducted by 2-5 people on each monitoring route. Teams move in \n\nrows with GPS and map the birds in their lists. Each bird has to be registered by at least 2 \n\ncounters before it is mapped. This allows for receiving reliable data from volunteers with \n\ndifferent level of knowledge and experience; moreover, volunteers are previously provided \n\nwith basic information on GPS use and bird counting and mapping by the camp coordinator.  \n\n\n\n80 \n\nDepending on the site size and availability of volunteers the following methods are used for \n\nthe counts: \n\n? counts on the sample plots; \n\n? full counts. \n\nAquatic Warbler counts 2013 were carried out at 3 most important AW breeding sites: \n\nZvaniec (end of May, beginning of July), Sporava (end of June) and Dzikoje mires. Double \n\ncounts were carried out at 18 sample plots in Zvaniec (central part), plus survey and full \n\ncounts at all suitable habitats in western and eastern parts (the most detailed counts ever \n\ncarried out at this mire).  \n\nFull counts were executed at c. 40% of the known localities in Sporava. Full counts at a major \n\npart of suitable habitat were performed in Dzikoje mire. Full counts were also carried out at \n\nsome small sites. The detailed results are presented in Table A46, Appendix. \n\n \n\nMain conclusions of the AW counts 2010-2013 are as follows: \n\nAccording to Kozulin and Malashevich, 2013, at present there are only 3 key Aquatic Warbler \n\nbreeding sites (Zvaniec, Sporava and Dzikoje) left in Palie?sie region, holding c. 2 750 - \n\n5 200 singing males (years 2010-2013). The rest of the national population breeds at 5 \n\npermanent sites with low numbers (Dzivin, Prostyr, \u0160?ara, Serva? and Svisla?) resulting in \n\n100 - 200 males and at 7 suboptimal sites holding 50-100 males in total.  \n\nSo, altogether 15 breeding sites were hosting 2 900-5 500 singing males in the years 2010-\n\n2013. Most of Belarusian breeding sites located at considerable distance (50-260 km) from \n\neach other. Such remoteness creates barriers for exchanges of birds between the sites. \n\nAt the key sites Zvaniec, Sporava and Dzikoje the species rapidly declines due to overgrowth \n\nof open fens with reeds and bushes. Comparison population estimates in late 1990-s and \n\nrecent monitoring data from the years 2010-2013, Aquatic Warbler numbers decreased for \n\nZvaniec from 3000-8000 until 2100-4400, for Sporava from 700-2100 until 500-600, for \n\nDzikoje from c. 1500 until 150-200 (Kozulin and Malashevich, 2013). These figures reflect \n\npopulation decline due to habitat loss. However it should be emphasized that these numbers \n\nalso reflect a more detailed level of survey implemented in recent years.  \n\nAs Malashevich, 2013 states, some sites (Dzikoje, Sierva?, A?many and \u017dadzien) are \n\ntransforming from fens into bogs.  \n\nAquatic Warbler numbers might be stabilized and even increased if there was a network of \n\nkey sites located not far from each other. It might be achieved through both securing optimal \n\nhabitat conditions at existing sites (Zvaniec, Sporava, Dzikoje, Sierva?) and restoring new big \n\n\n\n81 \n\nfen mires (Vyhana\u0161?anskaje, Hry?yna-Starobinskaje and Dakuda?skaje) (Malashevich, 2013). \n\nIt will secure fast population increase at the key sites until their maximum ecological \n\ncapacity, and considerable increase of both distance and numbers of fledglings disseminating \n\nto new areas within breeding range (including suboptimal sites) during their post nuptial \n\ndispersion. The network of key and suboptimal biotopes will allow exchanging individuals \n\nbetween the sites. This will stabilize population numbers even under conditions of negative \n\nprocesses at some sites. \n\nAquatic Warbler counts is an interesting scientific event and volunteer camp, allowing to \n\nexpand the number of people aware of the nature conservation problems at Belarusian mire \n\nsites, get those people involved and give them an extremely useful experience of bringing \n\ntheir own contribution to mires\u2019 conservation, getting to know new interesting people and \n\nwidening their knowledge of Belarusian nature. \n\n \n\nHabitat management \n\n \n\nAlthough the AW numbers are declining, the work that has been done in the recent 15 years \n\nin the field of AW and its habitat conservation is very efficient and goes far beyond the AW \n\ncounts but also involves the conservation measures taken at the key breeding sites: \n\n? development of the sites\u2019 inventories, ensurance of protection regimes; \n\n? regular mechanized mowing at Sporava mire since 2011 has proved its efficiency, allowing \n\nto decrease overgrowth with reeds, birches and willows at Sporava mire, provide habitat \n\nrestoration for the inhabitants of the mire. 400 ha were mown overall (Malashevich, 2013-\n\n2014);  \n\n? hydrological model developed for Zvaniec mire (Malashevich, 2013-2014); \n\n? mowing scheme is developed for Zvaniec also and is to be implemented within the Clima \n\nEast project (ClimaEast, 2014). \n\n  \n\n\n\n82 \n\n3.2.  Research sites: Portugal \n\n \n\n3.2.1 Paul de Arzila \n\n \n\n3.2.1.1 Location \n\n \n\nPaul de Arzila is a freshwater marsh located in the region of Centre (NUT II sub-division - \n\nEU geocode standard for referencing the subdivisions of countries for statistical purposes \n\n(Eurostat, 2014)), the sub-region of Baixo Mondego (Lower Mondego, NUT III sub-division \n\n(Eurostat, 2014)), on the left bank of the Mondego river (on the River Cernache affluent), part \n\nof the Coimbra district, three municipality councils (Coimbra, Condeixa-a-Nova and \n\nMontemor-o-Velho) and three parishes (Arzila, Pereira and Anobra) (Leit\u00e3o, 2013b). The \n\npaul is most closely located to the village of Arzila (Figure 3.15). \n\n  \n\nFigure 3.15 Location of Paul de Arzila (Google Earth) \n\n \n\n3.2.1.2 History and present main features \n\n \n\nThe paul was formed in the valley of the River Cernache, the left affluent of the River \n\nMondego, having represented one of the freshwater marshes in the valley of the Low \n\nMondego River which once was a giant wetland (Leit\u00e3o, 2013b). Judging by the words of the \n\npeople working in the area, in the old times, before humans started their intervention, the \n\nwetland was covered with True Bulrush Scirpus lacustris (Bunho in Portuguese) and Rushes \n\nJuncus sp which local people regularly cut for weaving and making mats and various \n\nhandicraft objects (Leit\u00e3o, 2013a). Besides, for many centuries agriculture was the main \n\nsource of income for Arzila village and nearby locations; fishing and hunting were practiced \n\n\n\n83 \n\nhere. However, regularization and drainage were maintained at biological equilibrium, until in \n\nthe 1950s agricultural practices were intensified by the fact that 2 ditches were opened in the \n\nvalley \u2013 Vala dos Moinhos in the east, Vala da Costa in the west which were supposed to \n\ndrain the water from the nearby hills, later the third ditch (Vala do Meio) was opened in \n\nbetween the two previous ones to drain the rest of the water and use the land for rice and corn \n\ncultivation (ICNF, 2003-2004). Localization of the ditches is shown on Figure A49, \n\nAppendix. \n\nThese are considered to be the most destructive measures ever taken in the area which \n\nseriously changed the hydrological regime of the Paul. The so-called regularization of water \n\nregime functions as follows: waterflow path gets rectilinear, completely unnatural, \n\ngroundwater levels diminish, the distance flown by water in the river diminishes as well, its \n\nflow speed rises, thus, the river channel deepens which causes and speeds up soil erosion. \n\nFurthermore, summer dissecation and diminution of fish flow in the paul are also the \n\nconsequences. What is more, the paul is a terminal part of the hydrographic basin of the River \n\nCernache and is close to the meeting point with the river (Leit\u00e3o, 2013b), so, it gets most \n\npollutants flow, influencing not only the surrounding area but the whole river basin. As a \n\nresult, the area of the paul has become overgrown with Common Reed Phragmites australis \n\nand Willows Salix sp. \n\nMoreover, the growth of the surrounding urban areas rose interest of the villagers in Coimbra \n\nvacancies and abandonment of agriculture as a principal activity, decrease in agricultural \n\nareas. What is more, nearby polluting industries (malfunction of wastewater treatment plants, \n\nfactory on transformation of animal products, agroindustries (ICNF, 2003-2004; Flumm, \n\n2006; Leit\u00e3o, 2013a)) played its part in deterioration of the water quality in the paul.  \n\n \n\n3.2.1.3 Protection regimes \n\n \n\nPaul de Arzila has the following national, European and international protection statuses: \n\n? National \u2013 Nature Reserve (Reserva Natural) designated in 1988 (Leit\u00e3o, 2013b); \n\nThe logo of the reserve shows Purple Heron as a key species (Figure 3.16). \n\n  \n\n\n\n84 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.16 Logo of the reserve (ICNF, 2014d) \n\n? European \u2013 Special Protection Area (ZPE \u2013 Zona de Protec\u00e7\u00e3o Especial, 1988), Site of \n\nCommunity Importance (S\u00edtio de Import\u00e2ncia Comunit\u00e1ria, 1997), Rede Natura 2000, \n\nBiogenetic Reserve of the Council of Europe (1990) (Leit\u00e3o, 2013b);  \n\n? International \u2013 Biotope CORINE (1987), Important Bird Area (IBA), Ramsar site \n\ndesignated in 1996 (ICNF, 2003-2004; Wetlands International, 2014). \n\nPaul de Arzila is an important part of a network of 3 wetlands in the Mondego valley, \n\nincluding 2 other IBAs \u2013 Paul do Taipal and Paul de Madriz. \n\n \n\n3.2.1.4 Area size and zoning \n\n \n\nThe nature reserve was established in 1988. According to Leit\u00e3o, 2013b, the territory of the \n\nreserve has an area of 585 ha (the area of the paul itself is about 150 ha) which is distinctly \n\ndivided into two parts: \n\n? the central part representing an alluvial plain with an extensive reedbed, areas of \n\npermanent submersion, and agricultural area, main vegetation is marshy one with Common \n\nReed Phragmites australis, True Bulrush Scirpus lacustris, Common Cattail Typha latifolia, \n\nRushes Juncus sp., and also tree species of Grey Willow Salix atrocinerea, Black Alder Alnus \n\nglutinosa, examples of Narrow-leafed Ash Fraxinus angustifolia, Elm Ulmus sp., Black \n\nPoplar Populus nigra (Figure A47-A48, Appendix);  \n\n? the second part is an area bordered by the hills of the river valley and covered mainly with \n\nforest and agricultural territories next to urban areas, main vegetation are tree species of \n\nMaritime Pine Pinus pinaster, Blue Gum Eucalyptus globulus, Portuguese Oak Quercus \n\nfaginea, English Oak Quercus robur. \n\nThe official zoning of Paul de Arzila (ICNF, 2004) defines 3 protection zones \u2013 Total \n\nProtection Area, Partial Protection Area, and Complementary Protection Area. What is more, \n\ntwo more protection levels are established: Partial Protection Zone has Area of Specific \n\nIntervention for Conservation of Natural Values, and Complementary Protection Zone has \n\n\n\n85 \n\nArea of Specific Intervention for Public Use. Finally, there is an area not subjected to \n\nprotection which corresponds with Urban Area (Figure 3.17).  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.17 Paul de Arzila zoning (ICNF, 2004) \n\n \n\nTotal Protection Area \u2013 114,12 ha (Leit\u00e3o, 2013b) \u2013 includes alluvial and riparian \n\nformations, oak woods, reedbeds and bulrush beds, ditches, lakes and ponds. \n\nPartial Protection Area \u2013 85,50 ha (Leit\u00e3o, 2013b) \u2013 includes flatland agricultural lands of \n\nthe type \u2018rice fields\u2019.  \n\nArea of Specific Intervention for Conservation of Natural Values was defined within this zone \n\nas an area of high interest of conservation of its biodiversity. There was defined a problem \n\nwithin this zone which is about agricultural production systems of intensive type (rice and \n\ncorn cultivation based on irrigation). These practices have to be in compliance with the \n\nobjectives of the natural reserve. \n\nComplementary Protection Area \u2013 384,16 ha (Leit\u00e3o, 2013b) \u2013 includes forests and bushes, \n\nagricultural lands on the hills. The problems of this zone are said to arise from using \n\ntraditional policultural systems in agriculture and existence of fast-growing tree species \n\npotentially threatening the other ones. \n\n\n\n86 \n\nThere is an Area of Specific Intervention for Public Use defined in this zone was created to \n\npermit the implementation of reconstruction of N341/347 road on the Alfarelos/Taveiro plot \n\n(Leit\u00e3o, 2013b). \n\nUrban Area \u2013 23,10 ha (Leit\u00e3o, 2013b) \u2013 a territory without any strong need of conservation \n\nnatural values (as it was defined in the zoning document (ICNF, 2004)) which corresponds \n\nwith the parts of villages next to the paul \u2013 Monte da Cima, Arzila, Lameira de Cima, \n\nLameira de Baixo, Caneira, Casal de S.Jo\u00e3o, Casal das Amoreiras, Casal das Figueiras. \n\nBy the landscape type and activities carried out there are distinguished 3 areas \u2013 areas with \n\nagricultural activities, forests and semi natural areas, wetlands (Leit\u00e3o, 2013b). This can be \n\nseen on Figure A50-A51, Table A7-A9 in Appendix. \n\nAgricultural areas are divided into two parts \u2013 the part on the hills occupied with olive trees, \n\nvineyards, orchards, arable rainfed lands, and the part of the valley occupied with irrigated \n\narable lands. \n\nWetlands (ca. 150 ha, 21 % of the reserve area (Leit\u00e3o, 2013b)) also are represented in 3 \n\nforms\u2013 freshwater marshes (permanent or lakes), seasonally inundated agricultural lands \n\nand canals. \n\nFreshwater marshes (permanent or lakes) are occupied with Common Reed, True Bulrush, \n\nGrey Willow. This zone has the biggest area out of all the 3 ones. \n\nSeasonally inundated agricultural lands are represented by rice fields. \n\nThe area of canals is very important for certain fish, amphibian species, European Otter Lutra \n\nlutra. \n\n \n\n3.2.1.5 Natural Values of Paul de Arzila \n\n \n\nPaul de Arzila possesses the following fauna species and carries out the following functions \n\n(Leit\u00e3o, 2013b;): \n\n? 126 bird species, including vulnerable species of Purple Heron Ardea purpurea, Goshawk \n\nAccipiter gentilis, Savi\u2019s Warbler Lacustella luscinioides, White Stork Cigonia Cigonia, \n\nMarsh Harrier Circus aeruginosus (2 pairs);  \n\n? nesting site for Little Bittern Ixobrychus minutus, its number increased from 2 pairs in \n\n2003 to 6-13 pairs thanks to the LIFE project in 2005, Black-crowned Night Heron \n\nNycticorax nycticorax, Cetti\u2019s Warbler Cettia Cetti, Savi\u2019s Warbler Lacustella luscinioides, \n\nCommon Reed Bunting Emberiza schoeniclus, a stable population of 5-6 pairs of \n\nreintroduced Purple Gallinule Porhpyrio porphyrio; \n\n\n\n87 \n\n? wintering ground for Common Teal Anas crecca, Mallard Anas platyrhynchos, Cattle \n\nEgret Bubulcus ibis, Little Egret Egretta Garzetta; \n\n? migratory stop-point for Sedge Warbler Acrocephalus schoenobaenus, Eurasian Reed \n\nWarbler Acrocephalus scirpaceus, Great Reed Warbler Acrocephalus arundinaceus, \n\nMelodious Warbler Hippolais polyglotta, Willow Warbler Phylloscopus trochilus, Bluethroat \n\nLuscinia svecica; \n\n? 21 mammal species, including Iberian Shrew Sorex granarius, Western Mediterranean \n\nMouse Mus spretus, Otter Lutra Lutra, Wildcat Felix silvestris; \n\n? >200 species of invertebrates; \n\n? 15 fish species, including an American one introduced to control mosquitoes (prevention \n\nof malaria) which is now common in the paul; Iberian endemics Iberian Barbel Barbus \n\nbocagei, Iberian Nase Chondrostoma polylepis, Lusitanian endemic species of Ruivaco \n\nRutilus macrolepidotus; \n\n? 11 reptilian species; \n\n? 8 amphibian species, but 2 frog species in decline due to predation from non-native \n\nLouisiana Crayfish, or Red Crawfish, which appeared in the surrounding area in the 1960s \n\n(Figure A53a, Appendix). One of the frogs, Discoglossus galgamoi, is now thought to be \n\nextinct in the paul and only survives in ponds on higher ground, the other one, Rana perezi, is \n\nalso in decline; endemics Iberian Triton Triturus boscai, Schreiber\u2019s Green Lizard Lacerta \n\nschreiberi; \n\nWhat is interesting, during the visit to the area, the great number of these crayfishes was the \n\nfirst thing to be noticed, to be more precise, the remains of them on the ground. Later, dozens \n\nof alive ones were seen in the gutter, which was quite surprising.  \n\nIt was said that after the 2001 big floods the number of Crayfish drastically increased but in \n\nrecent years a decrease was observed (it is believed, crayfishes have become otter\u2019s prey), so \n\nthe otter population has increased. In 2013, the floods reached the almost 2001 level, so, the \n\nCrayfish population has seriously increased again. \n\nHowever, it would not be true to say that during the visit the author has observed rich \n\nbiodiversity and pointed a lot of animal species. It could be because of the season (end of \n\nOctober), or due to the conditions in the paul are not suitable for hosting the above mentioned \n\nspecies anymore. \n\n  \n\n\n\n88 \n\n3.2.1.6 Current state: threats \n\n \n\nAs it has already been mentioned above, Paul de Arzila represents a lot of negative \n\nconsequences of improper, inappropriately planned human use. The main problems which are \n\nobvious now are the following (ICNF, 2003-2004): \n\n? reedbed overgrowth causing almost full displacement of naturally growing bulrush, typical \n\nof the area (Figure 3.18);  \n\n? willow overgrowth, also having taken the territory of True Bulrush (Figure 3.18); \n\n? Phragmites australis and Salix sp. cover about 75 % of the total wetland area; current \n\nestimates are Phragmites australis cover >90 % of the wetland area, open water&lt;5 %, wet \n\nreedbed&lt;10 %; \n\n? Watermifoil Myriophyllum spp invasion which caused eutrophication, water stagnation, \n\ndecrease of oxygen and retention of organic compost;  \n\n? non-native species of Crayfish having caused nearly extinction of 2 species of frogs; \n\n? absence of priority species chosen for conservation management; \n\n? absence of promotion of the paul as an ecotourism destination, few activities of the \n\nenvironmental centre; \n\n? ageing population of the surrounding villages, major employment of Arzila and Pereira \n\npopulation in the tertiary sector (mainly in Coimbra and 2 hospitals in the area, railway \n\nservices), Anobra inhabitants also employed in the secondary sector (nearby industries of \n\nCondeixa-a-Nova) \u2013 there is a tendency of increase in the area of forests and uncultivated \n\nlands and decrease in agricultural lands. \n\n \n\n\n\n89 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.18 Views of Paul de Arzila (Malashevich, 2014b) \n\n \n\nMoreover, there are problems coming from the outside of the paul: \n\n? domestic pollution \u2013 there are only 3 wastewater treatment plants working in the area \u2013 \n\nones of Arzila, Anobra and Vila Pouca villages, the other villages/towns neglecting the \n\npollution of the River Cernache affluents; \n\nThere are at least 5 ETAR with direct influence on the paul (Leit\u00e3o, 2013c). \n\n? industrial pollution \u2013 3 sources \u2013 ceramic production (already closed (Leit\u00e3o, 2013c)), \n\nfactory on transformation of animal products, the one on extraction and washing of \n\naggregates, and two agroindustries (mills). Only the first two have the wastewater treatment \n\nplants in operation, although not functioning properly sometimes; \n\n\n\n90 \n\n? diffuse pollution \u2013 intensification of agriculture in the form of use of fertilizers and other \n\nchemicals in corn and rice production \u2013 as a consequence we get degradation of living \n\nconditions for animals as well as contamination of alimentation for people. \n\nAs for now: agricultural practices tend to disappear, only small properties are left, they do not \n\nuse any chemicals, only natural fertilizers and herbicides to a small extent. So, degradation of \n\nanimal habitats is more a past consequence. \n\n? two hunting zones next to the area of the Paul de Arzila and a training camp for hunting \n\ninside the reserve, still existing but it is said they are not used (Leit\u00e3o, 2013c); \n\n? reconstruction of the road N341/347 on the Alfarelos/Taveiro plot. Part of Taveiro-Arzila \n\nhas been constructed, part Arzila-Granja de Ulmeiro is left (Leit\u00e3o, 2013b); \n\nIn the process of Management Plan development, there were diagnosed the existing negative \n\nfactors for the reserve. Some of them have been listed above and are showed on Figure A52, \n\nAppendix. \n\n? there is a need to adjust the Municipal Management Plans (MMPs) to the concept of the \n\nPaul in its Management Plan since there are misleading paragraphs in MMPs of the three \n\nmunicipalities which may cause management contradictions in the future, e.g. the \n\ncharacterization of the wetland regime as restriction of public use of soils. \n\nIt is important to understand the hierarchy of the Management Plan of Paul de Arzila and \n\nMunicipal Plans that are also related to the area. In Portugal the Wetland Management Plan is \n\ncalled Special Management Plan on territorial management of national scope, whereas \n\nMunicipal ones are regarded as Municipal Management Plans on territorial management of \n\nmunicipal scope. Thus, Special Management Plans are superior to Municipal ones (ICNF, \n\n2004). \n\n? the need to adjust the Paul Management Plan to the Regional Plan of the Centro Litoral \n\nsince the latter appears superior to the former (ICNF, 2004). \n\n \n\n3.2.1.7 Management: past and present \n\n \n\nThe major part of the paul is in private property of various owners, 65 ha is a state property \n\nwhich was bought from the private owners in 2003-2005 (Leit\u00e3o, 2013b; EU, 2007). \n\nThe objective to develop the first Management Plan was established in 2001. The information \n\nwas collected and prepared in the form of diagnostic and synthesis reports in 2003 (ICNF, \n\n2003-2004), they have been used by the author for this work since these materials are \n\n\n\n91 \n\navailable on the site of ICNF. The first Paul Management Plan was approved in 2004. At the \n\nmoment there is no new Management plan of the wetland, there is a draft version but not \n\nfinally approved. It has been taking already a long time to do that (Leit\u00e3o, 2013a). No \n\ninformation could be given to me from the draft version or on the question of priority \n\nobjectives set in the new plan. Only the questions on the changes of any points of the previous \n\nplan in the last 20 years were answered. There planned to be organized a meeting of the \n\nParties involved \u2013 local community representatives, local municipality, ministry of \n\nenvironmental affairs, centre itself etc  to decide on function division in the management of \n\nthe area (Leit\u00e3o, 2013a). \n\nPast management of the Paul de Arzila is characterized by setting the management objectives \n\nfor the Paul zones and 3 LIFE projects which will be described below. \n\nThe objectives set for the Total Protection Area were the following (ICNF; 2004): \n\n? the zone being the untouched area for preservation of natural processes and habitats, \n\nunique flora and fauna features, but implying intervention into habitats in the form of control \n\nof reedbed expansion, promotion of bulrush growth and expansion, opening of the lakes (open \n\npools that were created by the LIFE 2001-2006 project), ecological recuperation of the \n\nditches, monitoring of alluvial plains, control of natural succession and selection and \n\nelimination of alien to oak species; \n\nWhat is really done: the area has been untouched except for the LIFE projects in 2001-2006 \n\ndescribed below. \n\nThe objectives for the Partial Protection Area were set as follows: \n\n? area for conservation of natural values of rice cultivation fields and agricultural lands; \n\n? the rice field biotope was given the status of Area of Specific Intervention for Conservation \n\nof Natural Values since it has rich fauna and simultaneously suffers from intensive \n\nagricultural system; \n\n? area plan had to be elaborated in order to establish the maximum possible levels of \n\nfertilizers\u2019 use, control the groundwater level in the process of cultivation, control of \n\noverflow, drainage systems, introduction of a culture to be grown on the fields in the \n\nmidperiod of Autumn-Winter; \n\n? agricultural lands were said to be in need of reconsidering agricultural practices by \n\nrespecting the Code of Good Agricultural Practices;. \n\nWhat is really done: traditional agriculture continues but without fertilizers\u2019 use and \n\nsubstantially decreased in its area. \n\n\n\n92 \n\nThe Complementary Protection Area has been designed to preserve forest biotope together \n\nwith agricultural lands on the hills next to the paul and serve as a buffer zone for Total \n\nProtection Area. The Area of Specific Intervention for Public Use was created to permit the \n\nimplementation of reconstruction of N341/347 road on the Alfarelos/Taveiro plot. \n\n? the biotope of forests \u2013 measures for prevention of overgrowth of fast-growing exotic tree \n\nspecies and their planting, as well as encouraging local forest owners to plant native tree \n\nspecies in the area; \n\n? the biotope of agricultural lands \u2013 promoting respect for the Code of Good Agricultural \n\nPractices and development and application of the Zone Plan to the environmentally aggressive \n\npractices. \n\nWhat is really done: the area was created as a buffer zone for conservation of Total \n\nProtection Area, forest management measures are implemented here. \n\nOverall, Portuguese officially protected areas and their environmental centers are said to have \n\nthe objectives of working with local communities, prevention of illegal hunting etc. In reality \n\nthey do very few things out of those objectives due to various reasons \u2013 lack of funding \n\nsources and difficulty to get it, bureucaracy and neglection of nature conservation issues by \n\nthe authorities. Current management can be described from 2 sides \u2013 conservation and \n\ndevelopment aspects. \n\n \n\nConservation aspect \n\n \n\nThe following conservation measures and projects have been brought to life in Paul de Arzila: \n\n? the administration of the nature reserve managed to acquire 20 ha of the privately owned \n\nland in the 1990s; \n\n? LIFE Re-establishment of the Baixo Mondego marshes (1st phase) (1993-1995) (EU, \n\n1993). The objectives and results are in Table 3.5. \n\n \n\nTable 3.5 Objectives and results of the project (EU, 1993) \n\nObjectives Results \n\nkey areas would be safeguarded from degradation \n\nby land purchase and subsequent management \n\nacquisition of 12 ha of land to help safeguard the \n\nfreshwater marshes from degradation \n\ndisturbance of the sites would be brought under \n\ncontrol through surveillance by rangers \n\nrotational organic farming of rice and corn was \n\nstarted and the controlled use of herbicides and \n\npesticides investigated under the biotope \n\nmanagement \n\n\n\n93 \n\n? development of sustainable alternatives to \nintensive land use, such as organic farming and \n\neco tourism, would also be promoted \u2013 including \nthe construction of nature trails and information \n\ncentres; \n\n? inform the general public on the district\u2019s \necology and natural heritage. \n\n? nature trails were developed and guided visits / \nnature walks with wardens organized; \n\n? an information centre was built. \n\n \n\n? LIFE Porphyrio-Porhyrio project (1998-2001) \u2013 Reintroduction of the Purple Gallinule \n\nin the Lower Mondego River Valley project \u2013 birds were brought from the research centre in \n\nValencia, Spain; there was conducted reproduction in the wild in Coimbra and then the birds \n\nwere released in the pauls (Arzila, Madriz, Taipal) (EU, 1998). The objectives and results are \n\nin Table 3.6. \n\n \n\nTable 3.6 Objectives and results of LIFE Porhyrio-Porphyrio (EU, 1998) \n\nObjectives Results \n\nestablish a free breeding population in Arzila \n\nthrough the reintroduction of at least 30 animals \n? reintroduction and captive breeding of \nthe Purple Gallinule in the Mondego valley was \nachieved with success; \n\n? contribution to preparation of the \nEU Purple Gallinule Action Plan \n\nachieve captive breeding for reinforcement of the \n\nareas subject to reintroduction \n\na new expanding population of the target species \n\nin Portugal was achieved and due to this, its status \n\naccording to the Portuguese Red Data Book was \n\nreviewed to be changed from \u201cthreatened\u201d to \n\u201cvulnerable\u201d \n\nimprove the habitat quality for the target species aquatic bird fauna in general benefited from the \n\nhabitat improvement measures undertaken by the \n\nproject \n\nraise the awareness of the population awareness raised among students, the one aimed at \n\nthe local adult population was weak in some areas, \n\nwhich may be partially explained by \n\nthepopulation, traditionally unaware of nature \n\nconservation issues \n\ndevelop and apply a monitoring technique based \n\non the identification of individual vocalisations. \n\ndeveloped and applied \n\n \n\n? LIFE Palustris \u2013 Palustris (2001-2006) \u2013 Management of the Special Area of \n\nConservation of the Marsh of Arzila: 34 ha acquired for state property, open water pools \n\ncreated, reduction of the reedbed by 40%, all the canals recovered, construction of a ringing \n\nstation, construction of a macrophyte wastewater treatment plant, monitoring of species (EU, \n\n2001; 2007). The objectives and results are in Table 3.7. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n94 \n\nTable 3.7 Objectives and results of the LIFE Palustris-Palustris (EU, 2001; 2007) \n\nObjectives Results \n\ndraw up and partially implement a Paul de Arzila \n\nmanagement plan to increase habitat diversity and \n\nthe breeding population of target species;  \n\nhabitat diversity of the marsh increased with \n\nconsequent benefits to the vulnerable species; \n\nincrease all target habitats by at least 30% and see \n\ngreater numbers of key species (particular targets \n\nincluded seeing a 20% increase in the population \n\nof ruivaco and around 3 more nesting couples of \n\neach of the Western marsh harrier and the purple \n\nheron); \n\nthe reproductive population of the Purple Heron \n\nArdea purpurea doubled; \n \n\npurchase 68 ha of marsh ecosystem; 33.3 ha of targeted marshland purchased from 175 \n\nland owners to be managed exclusively for \n\nconservation purposes. This extended the total area \n\nof protected marshland in Arzila to 65 ha; \n\nreduction of the reedbank, creation of open water \n\nareas and removal of excessive sediments from the \n\nmarshes;  \n\n40% of the reedbed cleared, 2 ha of open water \n\nareas created. Key vegetation types spread, \n\nsediment removed from 22 ha of marshland; \n\n? set up facilities to treat wastewater by \nplants, monitor water quality and hydrology, and \n\ncarry out surveillance of target species \n\npopulations;  \n\n? achieve a 60% decrease in organic pollution \nand a 40% decrease in chemical pollution; \n\n? a total of 15 km of ditches restored in four \ndifferent areas of the reserve - Vala do Meio, Vala \n\nda Costa, Ponte do Passo and Vala dos Moinhos - \n\nallowing a better control of the water levels inside \n\nthe project implementation areas; \n\n? a tertiary treatment process introduced into \na facility for treatment of wastewater by plants; \n\nincrease local awareness of the importance of this \n\nwetland and build an observation tower. \n\na 7-meter high observation tower and an elevated \n\n60-meter pathway through the reedbed \n\nconstructed. \n\n \n\n? the area of bulrush has been gradually declining due to reedbed Phragmites australis \n\novergrowth, thus, only a small part remains, and only 1 local person does the cutting \n\nnowadays; \n\n? little has been done in the area of reedbed management. At the current stage of its growth, \n\nPhragmites australis needs regular cutting; \n\nHowever, it is important to note that in Portugal the problem of reedbed overgrowth on wetlands is not \n\ntaken as seriously as it is in Belarus, for example, since there it really threatens the huge areas of \n\nnatural mires. In Portugal Phragmites is not a common plant species, it serves for nesting of several \n\nimportant bird species, such as Reed Bunting, Purple Heron, Marsh Harrier, Great Reed Warbler, so, \n\nreedbed in this case plays a significant role in habitat support.  \n\nMoreover, rice fields are perceived and they really are feeding areas for birds, so, they are also seen as \n\na \u201cnecessary for conservation\u201d landscape. \n\n? the problem of White Willow Salix alba overgrowth has never been addressed which has \n\nbeen causing the transformation of the northern part of the paul into the forest (Flumm, 2006); \n\n? water quality assessment was conducted under the ICNF supervision (Brito and Mieiro, \n\n2006).  \n\n\n\n95 \n\nIn 2006, a sewage treatment plant started its work at the northern edge of the paul to tackle \n\nsewage coming from the surrounding villages. It has primary, secondary and tertiary \n\ntreatment phases and discharges away from the wetland (EU, 2007). \n\nDevelopment aspect \n\n \n\nPaul de Arzila has the following ecotourism and environmental education facilities: \n\n? there is an Interpretation Centre of the Paul de Arzila which has 4 employees (constructed \n\nwithin LIFE 1993-1995 project). Currently, little is being done by the centre due to lack of \n\ninvestment and initiative. What exists in the reserve is the results of  the 1990s work and LIFE \n\nprojects: \n\n1. exposition of bulrush use in artisanate inside the centre (Figure A53b, Appendix); \n\n2. bulletins, brochures and booklets from the 1990s, in Portuguese only. What is more, there \n\nis no objective to make the new ones at the moment. Absence of materials in English is not \n\nseen as a problem. Since, it is said, \u201cwe do not aim at mass tourism here, more at conservation \n\nactivities\u201d unfortunately, conservation activities are also not noticed at the moment; \n\n3. information board near the centre with a zone division of the paul and explanation of the \n\npedestrian route which is not easily-understandable (Figure A54, Appendix); \n\n4. pedestrian trail \u2013 path, bridge, observation points, one of them open, two other ones closed \n\n(constructed within 2001-2006 LIFE Palustris-Palustris (EU, 2007)). See Figure A53de, \n\nAppendix; \n\n? there is little promotion of the area: on the site of the ICNF, municipalities, \n\nVisitPortugal.com (Turismo de Portugal, 2014), some birdwatching sites, but mainly in \n\nPortuguese. Portuguese people are not interested in birdwatching that much, birdwatchers are \n\nmainly from the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Scandinavian region, so it would be useful to \n\nfocus on this group of potential visitors; \n\n? there is no local community involvement in the process of planning and development. \n\nWhat is said is that young part of local community of Arzila village mostly does not know \n\nabout the existence of the wetland, only if they get to know that on the school visits. What is \n\nmore, local people have never regarded this area as the one in need for conservation, they just \n\nused it for their own purposes, which means a rather low level of environmental awareness \n\nfrom the point of view of the modern green society.  \n\nOn the other hand, it is difficult to blame the people since locals are closer to nature more \n\nthan anyone else, they did what they did in the past for their own good but the problem is that \n\nnow the area is not used either for active agriculture or for artisanate due its degradation. It is \n\n\n\n96 \n\nimportant to note that locals are even opposed to the management of the reserve since the \n\nestablishment of the reserve set regulations of land use that deprived the people of their \n\nagricultural lands without any discussion with them and did not offer any alternative (Reis, \n\n2008). What remains is the area itself with all its biodiversity and negative consequences of \n\nhuman use having a great potential for conservation projects (which need funding), promotion \n\nand use for environmental education and ecological tourism purposes, moreover, bringing \n\nincome to local community and conserving the area for future generations. \n\nThe employees of the interpretation centre say they have had 2 alternatives \u2013 either stand for \n\ncomplete recuperation of the wetland which they did not support since human use was a \n\nnatural element in the process, so the area got its new features due to that, both negative and \n\npositive ones (Leit\u00e3o, 2013a). Thus, they have chosen the second alternative, to allow the \n\nwetland to develop naturally but try to slow down the degradation processes, so to say, take \n\naway negative factors and see what remains. It is a rather understandable and logical position \n\nbut on condition of completing the mission of erasing negative factors \u2013 reed and willow \n\novergrowth, non-native species of fish and crayfish, local community passiveness and \n\ndeprivation of lands, lack of investment, lack of initiative on the side of the centre team. \n\n \n\n3.2.1.8 What needs to be done and what is planned \n\n \n\nWhat needs to be done \n\n \n\nThe measures that need to be taken to improve the nature conservation and \n\necotourism/education performance of Paul de Arzila reserve are shown in Table 3.8. \n\n \n\nTable 3.8 Measures necessary for implementation in Paul de Arzila (Flumm, 2006) \n\nHabitat management Hydrological \n\nmanagement \n \n\nTourism and \n\nenvironmental education \n\nmanagement \n\n? regular reedbed cutting in the summer. Purple \nHeron nesting sites are to be avoided in the process \n\nof reedcutting; \n\n? increasing the areas covered with True Bulrush \nand Common Cattail for Purple Gallinules by \n\nspreading these plants within the reserve; \n\nwater level control \u2013 water \ngauge boards installation \n\nin order to measure water \n\nlevels throughout the year, \n\ndry and wet reedbed areas \n\nin the summer; \n\nlocal community \n\ninvolvement in the \n\nmanagement of the reserve \n\nand activities carried out; \n\n? underwater reedcutting with an amphibious \nvehicle in the winter; \n\n? willow removal; \n\nconstruction of sluce-weir \n\non at least one of the 3 \n\nditches. \n\ninfo promotion of the Paul, \n\ncreation of a web-site, \n\nupdated leaflets in \n\nPortuguese and English. \n\nchoosing a priority species for conservation \n\nmanagement and reed cutting, in particular. These \n\n  \n\n\n\n97 \n\nare assumed to be Purple Heron, Purple Gallinule \n\nand perhaps Marsh Harrier; \n\neradication of alien species by constructing isolated \n\npools on higher grounds and attracting frogs to \n\nthem in order to divide the territories of crayfishes \n\nand threatened species; \n\n  \n\nupdating maps, including constructed pools, \n\ndetermination % of open water cover, Phragmites \naustralis reedbed, Typha latifolia and Scirpus \nlacustris beds. \n\n  \n\n \n\nWhat is planned \n\n \n\nPlans for the future development of the reserve are listed below: \n\n? there planned to be organized a meeting of the Parties involved in management of the paul \n\n\u2013 representatives of the local community, the municipalities, the Ministry of Environment \n\nSpatial Planning and Energy, the interpretation centre itself to decide on function division in \n\nthe management of the area; \n\n? the new Management Plan is to be approved soon, it contains the future plans of the \n\nreserve administration. As for now, information about them was not given to me; \n\n? construction of the other part of the road N341/347 Arzila-Granja de Ulmeiro (Leit\u00e3o, \n\n2013a; 2013c). \n\n \n\n3.2.1.9 Water quality analysis \n\n \n\nWater quality analysis data are located in Chapter 3.2.1, Appendix.  \n\nThe main conclusion from the research data is as follows: the results of 1999 and 2011 have \n\nshown water deterioration inside the paul. Although ph, O2 saturation, conductivity levels \n\nhave not reflected drastic increases or decreases, the values of the nutrient parameters for the \n\npaul have equaled or even got higher than the level of those at the points close to the pollution \n\nsources. This has been caused by the effect of the wetland since water pollutants do not \n\naccumulate in the river, their values just reflect their real amount. For the wetland it is the \n\nother process: nutrients accumulate with time and only after a certain time period they can be \n\nreally diagnosed and confirmed to be present. This time seems to be actually now, negative \n\nconsequences of human activities are now seen in the paul not only in the form of extensive \n\nvegetation growth or poor biodiversity, but also in the values of water quality parameters. \n\n  \n\n\n\n98 \n\n3.2.1.10 Wetland condition analysis \n\n \n\nThe table of evaluation is located in Chapter 3.2.2, Appendix. The overall result obtained for \n\nPaul de Arzila is 15.51 out of 25 which is a medium, closer to low result showing lack of \n\nconservation actions for the areas and its gradual degradation. \n\n  \n\n\n\n99 \n\n3.2.2 Paul da Tornada \n\n \n\n3.2.2.1 Location \n\n \n\nPaul da Tornada is a freshwater permanently flooded marsh located in the region of Centre \n\n(NUT II sub-division (Eurostat, 2014)), the sub-region of Oeste (West, NUT III sub-division \n\n(Eurostat, 2014)), part of the district of Leiria, the municipality council of Caldas da Rainha, \n\nthe parish of Tornada village (ICNF, 2014a). The paul is situated right in the centre of \n\nTornada village (Figure 3.19).  \n\n  \n\nFigure 3.19 Location of Paul da Tornada (Google Earth)  \n\n \n\n3.2.2.2 History and present main features \n\n \n\nThe oldest historical references to the Tornada Marsh are associated with the creation of the \n\ncity of Caldas da Rainha and the foundation of its Thermal Hospital, by the Queen Leonor de \n\nLencastre in the end of the 15\nth\n\n century. The paul already existed at that time but with the \n\nname of Cornaga which then was changed in the 17\nth\n\n century (Lemos, 2013b). \n\nThe Tornada marsh is part of a set of lowlands created as a result of a range of sea arms that \n\nentered into the bay of S\u00e3o Martinho do Porto and covered the area of the paul and \n\nsurrounding zones. A few centuries ago a true inland sea existed in the region, surrounded by \n\nsubstantial human settlements (Lemos, 2013b). The area was formed in a small alluvial plain \n\nincluded in a typhonic valley with extensive reedbeds and a lot of aquatic openings (Figure \n\nA68, Appendix). Geologically, due to its sea formation the valley is surrounded by the \n\n\n\n100 \n\nstructures of mudslides and beach sands, argillaceous sandstones, lignites and dolomites, sand \n\ndunes and limestones (Figure A67, Appendix). Hydrographically, Paul da Tornada receives \n\nthe waterflow from the superficial sub-basin of Vala Real which then is connected with the \n\nTornada River basin (Figure A69, Appendix). \n\nWith sea retreat, the area gradually got its present hydrographic regime: the central zone \n\nstayed flooded most of the year, encircled by land covered with water only during the winter.  \n\nApproximately in the 13\nth\n\n century the margins of the area started to be used for agriculture, \n\nlater cultivated for the needs of the Thermal Hospital. The ditches are supposed to have been \n\nopened in the 16\nth\n\n century (Lemos, 2013b). Various owners have followed one another.  \n\nThe next references about the paul are only in the 1960s when the margins of the paul started \n\nto be used for vineyards and rice cultivation. Moreover, there existed species of bamboo \n\ncollected for making mats.  \n\nIn the next decades the paul has gone through degradation due to the nearby industries, \n\nunregulated livestock farms, sewage from Caldas da Rainha. There is evidence that in the dry \n\nperiods of the 1980s the pollutant discharges could be seen and a lot of animals were dead \n\n(Lemos, 2013b). Later the area had been abandoned until non-governmentla organizations \n\nAssociation PATO (A Associa\u00e7\u00e3o de Defesa do Paul de Tornada) and GEOTA took \n\npreservation and recuperation measures in 1988 (PATO, 2014). Since 1992 the site has been \n\nrented by GEOTA. In 2001 the area became a Ramsar site (Wetlands International, 2014). In \n\n2009 Paul da Tornada received the status of Local Natural Reserve (ICNF, 2014). \n\nSo the marsh now represents a central permanently inundated part of 25 ha divided in the \n\nmiddle by the drainage ditch of Vala de Meio and limited in the east and the west by two \n\ndrainage canals (Vala de Guarda Mato, Vala de Palhagueira), coming from small streams at \n\nthe south end of the marsh (Lemos, 2013b). In this flat zone the canals run until the northeast \n\nend of the wetland where they join. The system of ditches goes further to the north where the \n\nwaterflow converges into the Tornada River and further flows into the bay of S\u00e3o Martinho \n\ndo Porto. The permanent inundation of the Paul is explained by the fact that the groundwater \n\nlevel is very high due to the existence of the aquifier. The surrounding area gets inundated in \n\nthe rainy season although the area of the paul has the fewest amount of precipitation in the \n\nregion (Lemos, 2013b).  \n\n \n\n3.2.2.3 Protection regimes \n\n \n\nPaul da Tornada has the following national, European and international protection statuses: \n\n\n\n101 \n\n? National \u2013 Local Nature Reserve (Reserva Natural Local, established in 2009), part of \n\nReserva Ecol\u00f3gica Natural, Reserva Agr\u00edcola Nacional (2008), National Network of Protected \n\nAreas (Rede Nacional das \u00c1reas Protegidas, 2009), \u201cnatural areas\u201d by Caldas da Rainha \n\nmunicipality (2002) (Lemos, 2013b); \n\nLogo of the reserve (Figure 3.20) shows European Otter Lutra lutra as a key species. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.20 Logo of the reserve (ICNF, 2014a) \n\n? International \u2013 Ramsar Site established in 2001 (Wetlands International, 2014). \n\n \n\n3.2.2.4 Area size and zoning \n\n \n\nTornada Marsh has an area of 50 ha, out of which 25 ha are permanently inundated and form \n\na central zone: part of it is open water area with deeper zones representing small lakes.  \n\nLocalization of the paul is shown on Figure 3.21. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.21 Localization of Paul da Tornada on the physical map (Lemos, 2013b) \n\n\n\n102 \n\nDominant vegetation is Water Smartweed Polygonum amphibium L., Rigid Hornwort \n\nCeratophyllum demersum L.; True Bulrush Scirpus lacustris on the margins of the central \n\nzone (Lemos, 2013b). \n\n? semi-inundated area is mostly covered with Common Reed Phragmites australis. There are \n\nalso other plant species forming \u201ccarpets\u201d on the water surface, and trees like Grey Willow \n\nSalix atrocinerea and Black Poplar Populus nigra around the paul (Lemos, 2013b); \n\n? areas to the west and south of the paul, inundated only in the winter used for agriculture to \n\na small extent due to the hardly suitable conditions: April/May \u2013 planting of tomatoes, \n\npotatoes, corn, wheat, oat, pumpkin, cabbage, alface; between the inundated areas and the \n\nsouthern point of connection of 3 ditches \u2013 zone of corn and hybrid sargo growing in the \n\nsummer; \n\n? the surrounding forested areas are mostly covered with Maritime Pine Pinus pinaster and \n\nsome Tasmanian Blue Gum Eucalyptus globulus (Lemos, 2013b). \n\nThe zoning described above is reflected on the map of landscape units from the Management \n\nPlan (Figure A70, Appendix). Reed beds dominate the paul area. \n\n \n\n3.2.2.5 Natural values of Paul da Tornada \n\n \n\nAccording to Lemos (2013b), the paul possesses rare fauna species as well as carries out \n\nmultiple functions for them: \n\n?

important for some migratory species that stay a few days resting and feeding before \n\nfinishing their journey: Sedge Warbler Acrocephalus schoenobaenus, Eurasian Wigeon Anas \n\nPenelope, Garganey Anas querquedula, Bluethroat Luscinia svecica; \n\n? breeding site for some species that are threatened in most parts of their own \n\nbiogeographical area: Eurasian Reed Warbler Acrocepalus scirpaceus, Great Reed Warbler \n\n\n\n103 \n\nAcrocephaalus arundinaceus, Purple Swamp-Hen Porphyrio Porphyrio, Purple Heron Ardea \n\npurpurea, Squacco Heron Ardeola ralloides, Black-winged Stilt Himantopus himantopus, \n\nLittle Bittern Ixobrychus minutus, Savi\u2019s Warbler Locustella luscinioides; \n\nor to species that breed in this region and feed on the wetland or on the surroundings: \n\nCommon Swift Apus apus, Alpine Swift Apus melba, Rock Dove Columba livia, Common \n\nWood Pigeon Columba palumbus, Common Cuckoo Cuculus canorus; \n\n? important for some fishes such as Conger-eels Anguilla anguilla, a migratory species \n\nthreatened by water pollution and illegal fishing; \n\n? 18 species of mammals, habitat for some threatened mammals such as iberian endemics \n\nIberian Shrew Sorex granarius, Western Meditteranean Mouse Mus spretus; Greater White-\n\nToothed Shrew Crocidura russula, Least Weasel Mustela nivalis, European Badger Meles \n\nmeles, European Otter Lutra lutra; \n\n?

Currently it is rented by GEOTA (an \n\nenvironmental national NGO), together with PATO (self-funding) and receiving some \n\nfinancial support from the ICNF and the Municipal Council (C\u00e2mara Municipal de Caldas da \n\nRainha) (Lemos, 2013b). \n\nThe first Management Plan (Plano de Gest\u00e3o) of the reserve was developed in 2010 (Lemos, \n\n2013b). That one has been revised and given to the author for analysis. It must be noted that \n\nmanagement concept of Paul da Tornada is completely different from the other research sites \n\nin Portugal, the approach is modern and practically oriented. The main features and priorities \n\nof the Plan are set as follows (Lemos, 2013b): \n\n? the Management Plan has been the result of cooperation between central administration \n\n(ICNF), local administration (municipality of Caldas da Rainha) and NGOs of PATO and \n\nGEOTA; \n\n? there has been applied the concept of proactive territorial management with the mission to \n\nconserve, valorize and promote the natural heritage of Paul da Tornada through its research \n\nand interpretation, sustainable use, and connection with the community as an area for \n\neducation and recreation; \n\n? priorities:  \n\n1. maintain, enhance and promote natural values of the site;  \n\n\n\n107 \n\n2. boost the site development as a platform for education on sustainable development, in \n\ncooperation with civil society, regional and local entities; \n\n3. develop an innovative model of the site operational management; \n\nThe actions in the plan were developed within the 3 priority goals for various time periods \n\nwithin 2010-2016. Among these actions the key ones are as follows (Table 3.10): \n\n \n\nTable 3.10 Key actions of the Management Plan (Lemos, 2013b) and their fulfillment \n\n2010 Fulfillment  \n\nElaboration of candidature for community funds \n\nreceipt \u201cActive management of protected and \nclassified areas\u201d \n\nFulfilled \n\nIdentify exotic infesting species Fulfilled \n\nFacilitate elimination of sewage discharge Fulfilled, protocols with the involved entities \n\nSign collaboration protocols with investigation \n\ncentres \n\nFulfilled \n\nCreate a web-site of the reserve Fulfilled in 2011 \n\nMaintain the station for monitoring paludal and \n\naquatic bird species \n\nFulfilled \n\nPlan the system of trails for visits with information \n\nboards, signs \n\nFulfilled in 2011 \n\nDevelop a model implementation and revision of \n\nthe Plan \n\nFulfilled \n\nPlan the work group and their responsibilities for \n\non-time implementation of each action of the Plan \n\nFulfilled \n\nOrganize annual meetings of the Strategic Council \n\nand meetings with members of various entities \n\ninvolved in the Plan implementation \n\nFulfilled regularly \n\n2011  \n\nDevelop a programme on reed management and \n\nimplement actions on its cutting \n\nFulfilled and done regularly \n\nMaintain the roads necessary for fire prevention Regular control \n\nRemove infesting exotic species of plants Fulfilled \n\nPlant trees and bushes of riparian galleries \n\n(ash,willows, common cattail, true bulrush) \n\nFulfilled  \n\nConduct a research on pollution sources of the \n\npaul basin and monitor water quality \n\nResearch conducted, regular monitoring \n\nInventory and monitoring of ducks, otter, bats, \n\nturtles, dragonflies and butterflies, fish and \n\namphibians \n\nConducted regularly during the year \n\nReplan and rebuild the interpretation centre Fulfilled \n\nOrganization of guided visits, cooperation with \n\ntourism entreprises \n\nFulfilled, regular visits \n\nEmploy a professional intern, attract student \n\ninterns for projects \n\nFulfilled  \n\nParticipate in public events Fulfilled \n\nDevelop a database on flora, fauna, habitats and \n\nconservation measures in the reserve \n\nNot fulfilled, in the process \n\nPurchase lab equipment  Fulfilled \n\nSubmit an application of a candidature for \n\ncommunity funds receipt \n\nFulfilled \n\n2012  \n\nPlan creation of the system of the paul basin for \n\nmitigation of urban pressure \n\nNot fulfilled \n\nConstruct the trails and set inforboards, signs Not fulfilled \n\n\n\n108 \n\nDevelop a booklet for visitors Fulfilled \n\nImprove access to the centre Fulfilled \n\nOrganize a technical seminar about the reserve Fulfilled \n\n \n\nThe information showed above is an evidence of a rather efficient work of the reserve in the \n\nrecent 5 years. A lot of planned measures were implemented although there are a lot of them \n\nto still plan and bring to life. \n\n \n\nConservation aspect \n\n \n\nConservation work in Paul da Tornada has been led in the following directions: \n\n? there are some scientific projects in collaboration with the Universities (Faculdade de \n\nCi\u00eancias da Universidade de Lisboa; Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias e Tecnologia da Universidade \n\nNova de Lisboa; Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias da Universidade de Coimbra) and ICNF (Lemos, \n\n2013a); \n\n? under the Management Plan the following measures were planned (Table 3.11), they were \n\nmostly implemented in 2010-2012 or are being implemented regularly in the reserve. \n\nTable 3.11 Conservation actions of the Plan (Lemos, 2013b) \n\nIdentify exotic infesting species \n\nFacilitate elimination of sewage discharge \n\nSign collaboration protocols with investigation centres \n\nMaintain the station for monitoring paludal and aquatic bird species \n\nDevelop a programme on reed management and implement actions on its cutting \n\nMaintain the roads necessary for fire prevention \n\nRemove infesting exotic species of plants \n\nPlant trees and bushes of riparian galleries (ash,willows, common cattail, true bulrush) \n\nConduct a research on pollution sources of the paul basin and monitor water quality \n\nInventory and monitoring of ducks, otter, bats, turtles, dragonflies and butterflies, fish and amphibians \n\nDevelop a database on flora, fauna, habitats and conservation measures in the reserve \n\nPurchase lab equipment  \n\nPlan creation of the system of the paul basin for mitigation of urban pressure \n\nHowever, the measures on reed cutting taken in 2010-2012 are of a very small scope and have \n\nnot contributed to the overgrowth prevention. Cutting must be carried out urgently for the \n\nbigger areas. \n\nAll the other actions are also implemented to a small extent. This can not stop landscape \n\ndegradation if time management is not replanned. \n\n \n\nDevelopment aspect \n\n \n\n\n\n109 \n\nThe following measures were planned and partially fulfilled within the Managemetnt Plan \n\n(Table 3.12). \n\nTable 3.12 Development actions of the Plan (Lemos, 2013b) \n\nCreate a web-site of the reserve \n\nPlan the system of trails for visits with information boards, signs \n\nReplan and rebuild the interpretation centre \n\nOrganization of guided visits, cooperation with tourism entreprises \n\nEmploy a professional intern, attract student interns for projects \n\nParticipate in public events \n\nConstruct the trails and set inforboards, signs \n\nDevelop a booklet for visitors \n\nImprove access to the centre \n\nAs a result, the reserve now has the following conditions for ecotourism and environmental \n\neducation activities: \n\n? CEEPTA, ecological and educational centre of the paul opened in 2000 (Figure A71, \n\nAppendix; PATO, 2014), which is responsible for organization of various activities and \n\necotourism facilities such as: pedestrian trails in the paul,  educational workshops on \n\nrecycling, construction of nests and feeding platforms, aromatic and medical plants, \n\norganization of exhibitions, meetings, commemoration of environmental events; \n\n? there is an information kit for teachers, booklets for visitors in Portuguese (the new one is \n\nbeing prepared with an English version inclusively (Lemos, 2013c)); \n\n? there is an unequipped pedestrian trail (Figure A72, Appendix); \n\n? visitors are mostly school children, there are sometimes foreign tourists but very rarely \n\n(Figure 7A2, Appendix) (Lemos, 2013a), promotion is very low; \n\nThere is no stats on the number of visitors in the recent years but the approximate number \n\nannually is 3000-5000 people (Lemos, 2013c), most part of them being schoolchildren on the \n\norganized visits. \n\n? rudimentary laboratory has been created to allow scientific research for nature \n\nconservation on the site, there are sleeping places on the 2\nnd\n\n floor of the centre, together with \n\nbinoculars and spotting scope for visitors (Lemos, 2013b); \n\n? guided visits are offered to public if booked previously to visit (Lemos, 2013a). \n\n \n\n3.2.2.8 What needs to be done and what is planned \n\nWhat needs to be done \n\n \n\nThe following measures need to be taken to improve the nature conservation and \n\necotourism/education performance of the reserve: \n\n\n\n110 \n\n? search for long-term investment; \n\n? habitat management \u2013 reedcutting, removal of bushes, for both conservation and \n\nattractiveness purposes; \n\n? more active promotion of the site among potential tourists; \n\n? basic tourist facilities, e.g. possibility of use of the 2nd floor of the centre for \n\naccommodation of tourists, not only researchers, information boards, trails, observation \n\npoints; \n\n? involvement of local community members in the activities carried out by the reserve. \n\n \n\nWhat is planned \n\nPaul da Tornada has the following plans for the future: \n\n? there planned to be constructed 2 observation towers and a short wooden trail with an \n\ninformation board about birds of the paul. A small area of reeds and trees has been cut and \n\ncleaned for this future construction, edges of he marsh are to be cleaned for better visibility; \n\n? updated booklet in Portuguese and English is to be published; \n\n? revised actions of Management Plant to be implemented further (Lemos, 2013a). \n\n \n\n3.2.2.9 Water quality analysis \n\n \n\nThe data for evaluation of water quality at Paul da Tornada are located in Chapter 3.2.2, \n\nAppendix. The results of the analysis clearly indicate ongoing pollution in the paul by the \n\nhigh levels of nitrates, phopsphates and ammonia. The measures already taken by the \n\nadministration of the reserve do not seem to influence the problem since there has not been \n\nregistered any decrease in the nutrients\u2019 level. However, the regular assessment of the water \n\nquality in the future could determine the efficiency of the conservation actions since the \n\nimprovement of conditions in the paul needs time to be reflected in the water quality \n\nparameters. \n\n \n\n3.2.2.10 Wetland condition analysis \n\n \n\nThe table of evaluation is located in Chapter 3.2.2, Appendix. The overall result obtained for \n\nPaul da Tornada is 17 out of 25 which is a medium value showing that the paul is polluted \n\nwith nutrients, suffers from drainage in the past being severely overgrown and is involved in \n\nfew conservation actions. \n\n\n\n111 \n\n3.2.3 Paul do Boquilobo \n\n \n\n3.2.3.1 Location \n\n \n\nPaul do Boquilobo is a freshwater marsh located in the region of Alentejo (NUT II sub-\n\ndivision (Eurostat, 2014)), the sub-region of Lez\u00edria do Tejo (NUT III sub-division (Eurostat, \n\n2014)), on the right bank of the Tagus river (in the hydrographic basin of the River Almonda), \n\npart of the district of Santarem, the two municipality councils (Goleg\u00e3 and Torres Novas) and \n\nthe parish of Azinhaga village (Pereira, 2013b). Location is shown on Figure 3.23. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.23 Location of Paul do Boquilobo (Google Earth) \n\n \n\n3.2.3.2 History and present main features \n\n \n\nPaul do Boquilobo was formed in the transition zone between alluvial plain (corresponding \n\nmostly with Total Protection Zone) and fluvial terraces (the other Areas, zoning is described \n\nfurther in the text) (Pereira, 2013b).  \n\nThe alluvial plain was once an area of the River Almonda itself and surrounding seasonally \n\ninundated lands, now it is an area of the River Almonda, riparian galleries with willows and \n\nashes, drainage ditches. So, the area has been in agricultural use (rice cultivation with Poplar \n\nsurrounding the fields) for a long time, supported by the drainage procedures of the 20\nth\n\n \n\ncentury (Pereira, 2013b). As a result, the hydrographic basin of the river was drastically \n\nchanged by the network of multiple ditches. \n\n\n\n112 \n\nWith the establishment of the reserve in 1980 part of the area has gone through the \n\nregeneration process, the other one has continued to be used in agricultural practices. The \n\nresearch data (Pereira, 2013b) show consequent abandonment of lands by 1999.  \n\nThe hydrographic system of the paul as an agricultural area has functioned in the following \n\nway: floods from the Tagus River naturally inundate the site starting from October-November \n\nand part of it subsequently dries out when the water table is mechanically lowered in spring to \n\ncreate larger areas for cultivation. The site may also act as a flooding buffer zone contributing \n\nto increased protection of adjoining farmland areas against erosion caused by winter floods. \n\nFor many years this wetland has been a valuable sink for alluvial particles carried in by the \n\nTagus River creating rich cultivated areas, which have contributed to the economic wealth of \n\nthe area (see Figure A80, Appendix). \n\nFluvial terraces in the western part of the reserve were traditionally covered with cork oaks, \n\nrice fields and olive trees, later fig trees, irrigated crops cultivation appeared. By the 1980s \n\nthere had started transition to planting sunflower, tomatoes, melon, irrigated corn, beet, \n\nvineyards, land use for pastures, cork oaks with irrigated corn having become the dominant \n\nculture. \n\nIn the last 50 years, the area of the reserve was the property of 3 farm estates - Quinta do Paul \n\ndo Boquilobo, Quinta de Mato Miranda and Quinta da Broa, the first one once belonged to the \n\nKnights Templar and the Order of Christ (Pereira, 2013b). \n\nBefore reserve creation the paul was an area belonging to Quinta do Paul do Boquilobo as a \n\nhunting area. Now it is still belongs to the same family. What is left are 3 families of farmers \n\nand their houses (earlier there were 13 families), a church, and a farming area of olive trees, \n\ncork oaks where there are still 5 tractor drivers and 1 guard (Pereira, 2013b).  \n\nIn the area of Quinta de Mato Miranda there was a vineyard, olive trees grown in the 1920s, \n\nthen added cork oaks, wheat (did not grow well), then corn and sunflower in the 60s, and \n\nexperiments on animal farming (cows and pigs) (Pereira, 2013b).  \n\nNow the use of land is much less intensive. Land use regimes can be seen on Figure A83, \n\nAppendix. However, the drainage and intensive agriculture in the past have led to overgrowth \n\nof ditches with reeds, bulrushes, sedges and willows. \n\n \n\n3.2.3.3 Protection regimes \n\n \n\nPaul do Boquilobo has the following national, European and international protection statuses: \n\n? National \u2013 Nature Reserve (Reserva Natural, established in 1980 (ICNF, 2008)); \n\n\n\n113 \n\nLogo of the reserve (Figure 3.24) shows Purple Heron as a key species. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.24 Logo of the reserve (ICNF, 2014e) \n\n? European \u2013 Special Protection Area, Rede Natura 2000 (ICNF, 2014b); \n\n? International \u2013 Biosphere Reserve (the only Portuguese protected area in the World \n\nNetwork of Biosphere Reserves of UNESCO) (ICNF, 2014a), Ramsar site established in 1996 \n\n(Wetlands International, 2014), Important Bird Area (ICNF, 2014b). \n\n \n\n3.2.3.4 Area size and zoning \n\n \n\nThe reserve has an area of 817 ha (ICNF, 2014b) which, as it has already been mentioned, is a \n\ntransition zone between alluvial plain and fluvial terraces.  \n\nBy the reclassification of 2008 the reserve got its new division system into Total Protection \n\nArea, Partial Protection Area, Complementary Protection Area and Area of Specific \n\nIntervention. The state has bought almost the whole area of Total Protection Zone which \n\nallows for protection of the central core of the paul from the direct human disturbance. \n\nAccording to ICNF, 2008 and ICNF, 2014b, the paul is divided into the following zones \n\n(Figure 3.25): \n\n\n\n114 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.25 Zoning of the paul (Pereira, 2013b) \n\n\n\n115 \n\nTotal Protection Area 189 ha \u2013 permanently inundated areas, with limited access only for \n\nconservation obectives; \n\nPartial Protection Area 167 ha \u2013 temporarily inundated or not inundated areas, used for \n\npastures, fishing and conservation activities; \n\nComplementary Protection Area 436 ha \u2013 agricultural lands, with requirements for \n\nsustainable use of natural resources for well-being of the former 2 areas; \n\nArea of Specific Intervention 25 ha \u2013 estates, buildings associated with history of the paul, \n\nabove mentioned quintas. \n\nThe main part of the reserve area is covered with the wetland area, further by percentage of \n\ncover go agricultural lands, water areas, and forest lands. The  distribution of lands among \n\nvarious landscapes and activities is shown on  Figure A82-A83, Appendix.  \n\n \n\n3.2.3.5 Natural values of Paul do Boquilobo \n\n \n\nAccording to ICNF (2014b) and Pereira (2013b), the site possesses the following unique \n\nfeatures and fauna species: \n\n? important wetland site with excellent conditions for wintering, nesting and support of \n\nmigratory routes of many aquatic bird species especially such as Herons (Bulbucus ibis, \n\nEgretta garzetta, Nycticorax nycticorax, Ardea purpurea, Ardea cinerea, Ixobrychus minutus \n\ne Ardeola ralloides) and Eurasian Spoonbill Platalea leucorodia. During nesting season they \n\nform the biggest concentrations in the country; \n\n? during winter season the paul is a gathering site for ducks, Purple Swamphens, Coots, \n\nrepresenting 47 % of national winter population of Northern Pintail Anas acuta, 35 % of \n\nCommon Pochard Aythya ferina, 12 % of Shoveler Anas clypeata; \n\n? threatened species like Aquatic Warbler Acrocephalus paludicola, Water Pipit Anthus \n\nspinoletta and Bluethroat Luscinia svecica can be seen here; \n\n? important role in regulation of hydrological system and improvement of water quality, \n\nabsorbing excess water during rainy season and feeding groundwater during dry periods. \n\nOverall there were identified the following numbers of various species in the paul: \n\n? 16 fish species, including 2 lusitanian endemic species Boga portuguesa Chondrostoma \n\nlusitanicum and Rutilus macrolepidotus; \n\n? 11 reptile species; \n\nhttp://www.icnf.pt/portal/naturaclas/patrinatur/lvv/resource/doc/peix/chondr-lusit\nhttp://www.icnf.pt/portal/naturaclas/patrinatur/lvv/resource/doc/peix/chondr-lusit\n\n\n116 \n\n? 13 amphibian species, including 4 iberian endemics Iberian Newt Triturus boscai, Iberian \n\nFrog Rana iberica, Iberian midwife toad Alytes cisternasii, Iberian Painted Frog Discoglossus \n\ngalganoi; \n\n? 27 mammal species, among them European Otter, European Polecat; \n\n? 226 bird species. \n\n \n\n3.2.3.6 Current state: threats \n\n \n\nAccording to Pereira (2013b): \n\n? the problems in the area are caused by the drainage canals constructed up the River \n\nAlmonda stream to the north of the reserve and in the paul itself which disturbed the natural \n\nhydrographic system of the area and waterflow from the Rivers Tagus and Almonda, in \n\nparticular. The paul gets water renovation from them only during high floods which are not \n\nregular, the water it gets regularly is of poor quality and from secondary sources; \n\n? fishing and hunting practices allowed in the big part of the reserve \u2013 2 hunting  and 2 \n\nfishing zones within the forest and water area inside and outside the paul; \n\n? there is an exotic invasive species of Louisiana Crayfish that has already been mentioned \n\nin the Paul de Arzila characteristic. There have not been any researches on that in Paul do \n\nBoquilobo; \n\n? there is an American plant species of Water Hyacinth introduced in the 1970s that has \n\ninvaded the area (which is an indicator of its water pollution and excess of nutrients) and \n\nthreatens the whole ecosystem forming vast patches on the water that decrease oxygen \n\naccessibility and harm potential biodiversity; \n\n? urban and industrial pollution from the villages of Riachos, Entroncamento and Goleg\u00e3 \n\n(pig farms) with pollutants reaching the western part of the reserve (nesting sites of lots of \n\nbird species), agricultural pollution (nutrients and plastic). \n\nIt is important to note that all the pollution sources, except for agriculture, are located outside \n\nthe reserve. The problem here is malfunctioning of sanitation system in the Almonda basin; \n\n? lack of activities at the interpretation centre of the paul, lack of promotion of the reserve as \n\nan ecotourism destination. \n\nThe views of the paul at present are shown below (Figure 3.26). \n\n\n\n117 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n118 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.26 Views of Paul do Boquilobo (Malashevich, 2014b) \n\n\n\n119 \n\n3.2.3.7 Management: past and present \n\n \n\nThe reserve is managed by its administration, with the help of the municipalities. A big part of \n\nthe lands have been bought from the various landowners by the state (177 ha, 150 ha of which \n\nis Total Protection Area (ICNF, 2014b). \n\nThe main agricultural users for now are 3 above mentioned estates, the agriculturers of \n\nGoleg\u00e3 and Azinhaga to the east of the paul, the ones of Riachos and Goleg\u00e3 to the north. To \n\nthe west of the reserve are pastures (goats, sheep) of people from Brogueira and Alcorochel. \n\nFishers are mostly people from Azinhaga village (Pereira, 2013b). \n\nThe Paul Management Plan was approved in 2008. \n\nThe development strategy of the paul aims first of all, at (ICNF, 2008): \n\n? conservation of natural values (herons colony, palearctic birds\u2019 wintering sites) of the \n\ncentral part of the paul with permanently inundated lands; \n\n? maintenance of the sesoanlly inundated lands and areas of extensive use between the \n\ncentral part and peripheral part of intensive agricultural use; \n\n? reestablishment of water connections with the Tagus and Almonda Rivers and clearing of \n\nthe ditches to widen the inundated areas and stop the ongoing reduction of the wetland; \n\n? recuperation of riparian galleries; \n\n? sustainable management of resources for adequate agricultural, fishing, forestry practices \n\nand land use for pastures;  \n\n? proper management of area use by public visitors, its recreational use for educational \n\npurposes,  its use as a laboratory for research.  \n\nTo achieve this, the reserve has been in collaboration with the organisations working in  \n\nagriculture, farming, research and education, and also in a permanent dialogue with the \n\nauthorities (Pereira, 2013a). \n\n \n\nConservation aspect \n\n \n\nThere were planned the following measures in the reserve by the 2008 Management Plan \n\n(ICNF, 2008; Pereira, 2013b): \n\nTotal Protection Area: \n\n\n\n120 \n\n? establishment of Additional Water Treatment Station for supplemental purification after \n\nETAR, and construction of dam system in the Almonda basin for providing water supply in \n\nperiods of high floods; \n\n? reconstruction of an old ditch which connects Total Protection Area with Valado da \n\nEstrema in V\u00e1rzea do Canto dos Trancos; \n\n? construction of a new ditch to create a protection zone between agricultural lands and Total \n\nProtection Area; \n\nPartial Protection Area: \n\n? creation of a pedestrian trail which exists in the unequipped form, the other route for \n\nobservation of habitats, and organization of camping places; \n\n? construction of the gate for management of ETAR effluents and their redirection into the \n\nRiver Almonda in case of accident of malfunction \u2013 this measure is hard to understand, \n\nobvious is the fact that it is taken for protection of agricultural fields and not for improvement \n\nof water quality; \n\n? regeneration of connection between the Tagus and the paul through the system of alvercas \n\nof Goleg\u00e3, using existing ditches, which will allow water renovation both in the paul and \n\nalvercas not depending on flood season; \n\nWhat is being done: \n\n? control of water level in the paul is continued to be done through the existing system of \n\nditches using the following rules: upon the start of rainy season the gates are kept open for \n\nwater renovation until the water level is 1.5 m or a bit higher, the gates are kept closed as long \n\nas the water level is 1.5 m; \n\n? permanent monitoring of fauna (especially avifauna) in the form of regular bird counts by \n\nthe paul employees (Pereira, 2013a); \n\n? there exist agreements with various educational institutions of secondary and polytechnic \n\nlevel on monitoring environmental conditions in the paul, water and soil quality in particular; \n\n? as a result of 2 previous points \u2013 rich photo database on the evolution of the area (Pereira, \n\n2013a); \n\n? there have been the bird conservation projects, e.g. the one on placing nests at particular \n\npoints to enhance nesting of certain bird species (Pereira, 2013a); \n\n? there is currently a project on conservation of a rare plant species Narcissus fernandesii, \n\naimed at its establishment on the new lands acquired by state (Pereira, 2013a); \n\n\n\n121 \n\n? there has been a permanent collaboration dialogue with Torres Novas municipality within \n\nwhich there is a current project with community funds on improvement of sanitation \n\nconditions in the municipality which would resolve the pollution problem in the reserve also \n\n(Pereira, 2013a); \n\n? the efforts to tackle the negative consequences of drainage ditches construction have been \n\nfaced with lack of human and financial resources. \n\n \n\nDevelopment aspect \n\n \n\nThe paul possesses the following facilities for ecotourism and environmental education: \n\n? the paul is open to visitors (tourists, scientists, students) supporting the main objective of \n\nnature conservation (Pereira, 2013a). There is a partially equipped pedestrian trail that can be \n\ndone independently by visitors (Figure A84, Appendix), with information boards, observation \n\ntower (Figure A85, Appendix) which is hard to find due to overgrowth with bushes. Requests \n\nfor guided visits are also accepted (Pereira, 2013a); \n\n? there is an Interpretation Centre with an exhibition on the paul. However, the timetable of \n\nthe paul centre is rather irregular; \n\n? there are no updated booklets (only the old ones in Portuguese), little promotion (sites of \n\nICNF, municipalities, birdwatching sites, with information mainly in Portuguese) and no web-\n\nsite; \n\n? there are 2 enterprises licensed to organize pedestrian walks in the reserve (Pereira, 2013a). \n\n \n\n3.2.3.8 What needs to be done \n\n \n\nThere is no information on future plans of the reserve. So, the necessary measures are listed \n\nbelow: \n\n? renovation of the proper connection with the Rivers Tagus and Almonda; \n\n? elimination of pollution sources, cooperation with the entities involved in the problem; \n\n? research and plan for elimination of invasive plant and animal species; \n\n? more active promotion of the site, development of the strategy on working with visitors, \n\ncreation of a web-site; \n\n? clearing of certain areas accessible for visitors from the bushes and trees; \n\n? installation of infoboards, plan on organization of accommodation, other tourism facilities; \n\n\n\n122 \n\n? development of a new booklet in English and Portuguese; \n\n? revision of the Management Plan and proper management of its implementation, \n\ndistribution of responsibilities among the administration members; \n\n? regular control of the actions implemented within the Management Plan. \n\n \n\n3.2.3.9 Water quality analysis \n\n \n\nThe research data and results are located in Chapter 3.2.3, Appendix. The results of the \n\nanalysis give a clear evidence of the ongoing penetration of the pollutants into the paul. \n\nThough the nutrients\u2019 values are not in the critical range for the paul itself, their values \n\noutside the site show high pollution levels. Moreover, the data for the analysis point inside the \n\nsite were available only till 2005 which increase the possibility of the current values being \n\nmuch higher. The exact information could be obtained in case of conducting present analysis \n\nat the 2 points and comparing the results. \n\n \n\n3.2.3.10 Wetland condition analysis \n\n \n\nThe Table of evaluation is located in Chapter 3.2.3, Appendix. The overall result obtained for \n\nPaul do Boquilobo is 16.66 out of 25 which is a medium value showing that the paul suffers \n\nfrom the ongoing pollution, drainage and intensive agricultural use consequences and lack of \n\nconservation actions. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n123 \n\n3.2.4 Peatbog in Lagoa de D. Jo\u00e3o \n\n \n\nThe peat bog in Lagoa do Dom Jo\u00e3o is part of the mountainous range of Serra de Montemuro \n\nin the north of Portugal, however, no management regulations are applied to it, no nature \n\nconservation and tourism activities carried out, few factors threatening its well-being (fires, \n\ncattle). The site is completely natural and almost untouched. The reason for its including into \n\nthe research list was stated in Introduction. The characteristic of this peat bog does not \n\nprovide information on efficient wetland management since its location and use have \n\nguaranteed its conservation. However, it is important as the only peat marsh among the \n\nPortuguese research sites and peat ph analysis can serve as a confirmation of its high \n\nconservation status. \n\n \n\n3.2.4.1 Location \n\n \n\nThe peat bog is situated in the north of Portugal, the mountainous region of Serra de \n\nMontemuro, the region of Norte (NUT II sub-division) (Eurostat, 2014), the sub-region of \n\nT\u00e2mega (NUT III sub-division), the district of Viseu, the council of Resende, the parishes of \n\nPanchorra and Feir\u00e3o (Profico Ambiente, 2006). Location is shown on Figure 3.27. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.27 Location of the bog (Google Earth) \n\n \n\n3.2.4.2 History and present main features \n\n \n\nSerra de Montemuro, where the peat bog is situated, is bounded by the River Douro on the \n\nnorth and by the River Paiva in the south and southwest (Esp\u00edrito de Aventura, 2013). It is a \n\n\n\n124 \n\nvery important site for conservation of species such as wolf and water-mole. \n\nThe dominated flora is English oak Quercus robur and Maritime pine Pinus pinaster \n\n(Turismo de Portugal, 2014b). Serra de Montemuro is known for its granitic valleys with \n\nstones scattered around the mountain areas. \n\nThe peat bog in Lagoa do D. Jo\u00e3o is a typical one for the Portuguese mountains. Such \n\npeatbogs form on the mountain platforms with lowland parts which were part of marine areas \n\nin the past (Terra Nossa, 2006): the geological conditions were created, rainwater was \n\ngradually collected in the shallow lakes where Sphagnum moss grows easily, organic matter \n\naccumulates and decomposes turning into peat. \n\nMountain peat bogs are formations of high importance because they are used as pastures by \n\nlocals. However, it is necessary to note that most areas are used rather sustainably due to a \n\nsmall number of cattle and a low level of their disturbance since they are far from any mass \n\ntourist route. However, some of the peatbogs reflect the consequences of intensive agriculture \n\nand fires (Serra da Freita) (RTP, 2005). \n\nThe peat bog in Lagoa de D. Jo\u00e3o was formed in the same way as it was described above. It \n\nrepresents a lake of 3 ha and an adjacent 10 ha area of peat bog at 1110 m elevation with \n\ncharacteristic bog vegetation (Sphagnum spp., Juncus aquarossus, Carex spp., Drosera \n\nrotundifolia), water level of 0.15 m approximately.  \n\nNext to the site there is the Eolic park of D. Jo\u00e3o and Feir\u00e3o which posed a threat to the \n\npeatbog in 2005 when its planning was discussed with the authorities and there was an \n\nintention to construct a trail for better access to the wind turbines which would cross the \n\npeatbog. Fortunately, this was prevented and the site was left untouched (Profico Ambiente, \n\n2006). \n\nGranitic stones are represented here scattered around the mountain slopes on one side and \n\ngathered into fences for cattle on the other. The site has been used for pastures and forestry, \n\nnow these activities are continued. Moreover, there have been fires in the recent 40-50 years \n\nfrom which he peatbog suffered (Monteiro-Henriques, 2014). Anyway, like it was said above, \n\nthe site looks natural and weakly disturbed, it is too far from the main tourist routes, \n\nsometimes there can be visitors but few of them, so, nature conservation and tourism at the \n\nsite are not developed. Moreover, there is no need in nature conservation activities since the \n\nbog has always developed naturally.  \n\nThe views of the bog are shown on Figure 3.28 below. \n\n\n\n125 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n126 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n127 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.28 Views of the bog (Malashevich, 2014b) \n\nIt must be noted that the other areas of Serra de Montemuro are said to suffer the \n\nconsequences of human activities: deforestation, overgrowth with bushes and shrubs due to \n\nactive use of the lands for pastures. The research peat bog is least suffered of the area in this \n\ncase.  \n\nWhat concerns tourism, it must be said, there are some tourist routes passing next to the peat \n\nbog but not directly through it (Turismo de Portugal, 2014b).  \n\n \n\n3.2.4.3 Protection regimes \n\n \n\nThe peatbog has the following national and European protection statuses: \n\n? National \u2013 being part of Serra de Montemuro, it belongs to Reserva Agr\u00edcola Nacional, \n\nReserva Ecol\u00f3gia Nacional, Biotope CORINE Montemuro/Bigorne (Turismo Centro de \n\nPortugal, 2014); \n\n? European \u2013 part of the 1st phase of the National List of Rede Natura 2000 (Turismo \n\nCentro de Portugal, 2014). \n\n \n\n3.2.4.4 Peat ph analysis \n\n \n\nPh analysis of peat at Lagoa do Dom Jo\u00e3o was carried out on 30 October, 2013. Samples were \n\ntaken at 4 locations (3 samples per each location) since the peat layer depth was not exactly \n\nknown. \n\n\n\n128 \n\nThe samples from the first 3 locations turned out to be more \u201cearth\u201d than \u201cpeat\u201d, so only the \n\n4\nth\n\n location\u00b4s results are supposed to show the real peat ph values. Average values were then \n\nobtained (Table 3.13). \n\nTable 3.13 Results of peat ph analysis \n\nLocation Ph Sample 4 \n\n1 4.07 \n\n2 4.05 \n\n3 4.05 \n\n4 4.057 \n\n \n\nThe peat ph results at the 4\nth\n\n location demonstrate the strongly acidic character of peat (low \n\nvalues of ph) which is typical of a natural peat bog.  \n\nThe value of the von Post Decomposition Index is 3 which means \u201cvery slightly decomposed \n\npeat which, when squeezed, releases muddy brown water, but from which no peat passes \n\nbetween the fingers. Plant remains still identifiable, and no amorphous material present\u201d (von \n\nPost Decomposition Index Figure A89, Appendix). \n\nSo, the analysis turns out to confirm the almost unchanged character of the site and its natural \n\ndevelopment. However, fires and further area use for pastures pose threats to future well-\n\nbeing of the bog. \n\nThere is no point and perspective for tourism development here. Those interested in \n\ndiscovering Portuguese peat bogs will find information about them. However, this part could \n\nbe much better organized since there is not much database information about the Portuguese \n\n\u201cturfeiras\u201d on the Internet. \n\n \n\n3.2.4.5 Wetland condition analysis \n \n\nThe Table of evaluation is located in Appendix. The overall result obtained for the site is \n\n24.17 out of 25 which shows natural state of the bog and few disturbing factors with no need \n\nfor active conservation actions. \n\n  \n\n\n\n129 \n\n3.2.5 LIFE+TRACHEMYS (Portugal) \n\n \n\n3.2.5.1 When, where and why \n\n \n\nThe LIFE+Trachemys project on Demonstration strategy and techniques for the eradication of \n\ninvasive freshwater turtles was implemented in Portugal (Algarve) and Spain (Valencia) in \n\n2011-2013 under the LIFE+Biodiversity initiative (CIBIO, 2013a). \n\nLIFE+ programme is a financial instrument for nature protection and conservation in the \n\nEuropean Union which co-finances environmental initiatives in Member countries. The \n\nLIFE+Trachemys is included in the LIFE+Biodiversity section which is set to develop \n\ninnovative techniques for the EU aim of \u201cstopping biodiversity loss\u201d (Generalitat Valenciana, \n\n2013). \n\nThe main aim of the project, accoding to CIBIO, 2013a, was to address the issue of \n\nintroduction of invasive exotic species, in particular, the negative environmental impacts on \n\nwetland environments and native freshwater turtle species of the European Pond Turtle Emys \n\norbicularis and the Mediterranean turtle Mauremys leprosa from alien exotic turtle species, \n\nparticularly the Red-eared slider Trachemys scripta elegans in the Mediterranean region, \n\nSpain and Portugal in particular (characterization of native and exotic species is in Chapter \n\n3.2.5, Appendix). These impacts have been as follows (CIBIO, 2013b): \n\n? Loss of aquatic biodiversity due to aggressive behavior of exotic turtle species (exotic \n\nturtle species are predators); \n\n? Fast breeding mechanism and aggressive behavior towards native turtle species; \n\n? Distribution of diseases in the aquatic habitats. \n\n \n\nThe pet turtle trade began in 1970 when the first Trachemys scripta were caught to reproduce \n\nin captivity. At the same time the Ninja Turtles movie was shown on TV (1987-1996) which \n\nbrought pet turtle sales to its maximum. The trade has led to a large number of specimens \n\nbeing maintained in captivity. It is estimated 26 million individuals were sold around the \n\nworld in 1989-1994.  The pets were often released unthinkingly or even escaped by \n\nthemselves into the wild. This could be caused by the lack of good conditions for keeping \n\nthem (big size to which they can grow, aggressiveness, noise) or simply by annoyance from \n\nkeeping animals for a long time since they can live for 40-50 years. Due to these releases, \n\nnow Trachemys scripta can be encountered in rivers, lakes, parks and public gardens of \n\nPortugal as well as other European countries. Nowadays, Trachemys scripta is considered to \n\n\n\n130 \n\nbe a non-indigenous species with ecological risk in Portugal and one of the 100 most \n\ndangerous invasive exotic species in the world by the International Union for Conservation of \n\nNature. In Portugal import of Trachemys scripta was forbiddem by Law in 1996, in 1999 \n\ncommercialization of the species was forbidden. However, the Law lacks measures of control \n\nand application of regulations which explains the fact that turtle trade and release are still a \n\ncommon practice in Portugal (CIBIO, 2013b). \n\n \n\n3.2.5.2 Project sites and institutions involved \n\n \n\nAccording to CIBIO (2013a), the project included 13 areas of action in Valencia and 4 areas \n\nin Portugal. The Portuguese sites were in Algarve \u2013 4 lakes of Ria Formosa. Below the \n\nPortuguese project sites are shown (Figure 3.29). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.29 Project sites in Portugal: A \u2013 CIBIO and Biological park of Gaia, reception centre \n\nfor the exotic turtles, B \u2013 RIAS, reception centre for the exotic turtles, 1, 2, 3, 4 \u2013 areas of \n\naction defined by the LIFE+ Trachemys project (CIBIO, 2013a) \n\n \n\nThe institutions involved (CIBIO, 2013a): \n\n? The University of Porto and CIBIO-IETA, Centre of Investigation of Biodiversity \n\nand Genetic Resources belonging to the university, Institute of Agricultural and Food \n\nSciences and Technologies, an NGO financing university research; \n\n? ALDEIA-RIAS \u2013 ALDEIA is an NGO working for sustainable development and nature \n\nconservation, with two centres of reception and recuperation of wild animals \u2013 CERVAS in \n\nSerra de Estrela Natural Park and RIAS in Ria Formosa Natural Park. The latter was one of \n\nthe LIFE Trachemys reception centres; \n\n\n\n131 \n\n?  Biological park of Gaia (Parque Biol\u00f3gico de GAIA) \u2013 a permanent centre of \n\nenvironmental education with the centres for recuperation of injured wild animals or those \n\nsuffered from illegal captures; \n\n?  Generalitat Valenciana* - Department of Infrastructure, Territory and Environment of \n\nthe Valencia Community Government, Ministry of Equipment, Planning and Environment \u2013 \n\npublic institutions responsible for nature conservation issues, management of protected areas \n\nof Valencia; \n\n*various self-governmnet institutions under which the Spanish autonomous community of \n\nValencia is politically organized; \n\n?  VAERSA \u2013 public entreprise of the Generalitat Valenciana carrying out studies on \n\nvarious environmental aspects, including the study on the autochthonous freshwater turtle \n\nspecies.  \n\n \n\n3.2.5.3 What was planned to do: To develop a strategy in order to preserve aquatic \n\nendangered species of endemic fish and autochthonous freshwater turtles in Valencia and \n\nAlgarve by eradicating wild populations of exotic invasive freshwater turtles, and then test \n\nefficiency of new methods of control and eradication of invasive species, reinforcement and \n\nconservation of native turtles (EU, 2011). \n\nThe expected results for the project were set as follows, according to EU (2011): \n\n? development of standardized protocol methods and techniques for the eradication of exotic \n\ninvasive freshwater turtle populations in wetlands; \n\n? implementation of the protocol in pilot areas (natural wetlands in Spain and Portugal); \n\n? demonstration of the viability and feasibility of new techniques for detecting nesting areas \n\nof exotic invasive freshwater turtle populations in wetlands; \n\n? collection of individual exotic turtles (mainly T. scripta) from 17 wetlands of Valencia and \n\nPortugal; \n\n? eradication of eggs of exotic turtles (mainly T. scripta) from 11 wetlands of Valencia and \n\nPortugal; \n\n? eradication of wild populations of exotic invasive freshwater turtles from 17 natural \n\nwetlands in Spain and Portugal; \n\n? production of a handbook about the eradication of exotic invasive freshwater turtle \n\npopulations in wetlands;  \n\n\n\n132 \n\n? reinforcement of 10 populations of indigenous endangered freshwater turtles in Valencia \n\nand Portugal;  \n\n? holding of an international seminar about the control of invasive exotic fauna in wetlands.  \n\n \n\n3.2.5.4 Materials and methodology \n\n \n\nTrapping techniques and localization of traps \n\n \n\nDuring captures both passive (nasas with or without baits and fluctuating traps) and active \n\n(hand capture, collection with a shrimp catcher (camaroeiro in Portuguese)) techniques were \n\nused (CIBIO, 2013b). See Figures A93-A95, Appendix. \n\nAs CIBIO (2013b) states, nasas were located next to the margins of the lakes with difficult \n\naccess and low visibility to prevent robberies. \n\nFluctuating traps were located in the deepest zones of the lakes where the biggest number of \n\nindividuals was observed during rest and thermoregulation or where there were few places for \n\nthat (Figure A96, Appendix). \n\nDuring the active working periods the nasas were checked every 2-3 days, the fluctuating \n\ntraps \u2013 every week whereas in the winter it was done every 15 days. Hand capture and \n\ncollection with a shrimp catcher were used in every possible case. All the project sites were \n\nregularly checked for nests of exotic species. If found, they were registered, opened, eggs and \n\nneonates removed from them. \n\n \n\n3.2.5.5 Management of captured individuals \n\n \n\nAll the captured animals were identified and given a number. Natives were separated from \n\nexotic ones. Various measurements were made: length, width, weight, sex, maturity and other \n\nphysical characteristics. Afterwards natives were released back into the wild in the places they \n\nwere captured. Exotics, in case of Portugal, were transported to the reception centre of RIAS \n\nin Olh\u00e3o and further transported to the Zoological Park KrazyWorld in Algoz (Parque \n\nZool\u00f3gico de Algoz) (CIBIO, 2013b). \n\n \n\n3.2.5.6 What was done \n\n \n\n\n\n133 \n\nThe results of the project including the captures will be represented for the Portuguese project \n\nsites. According to CIBIO (2013 a; b): \n\n? various capture methods were developed: different kinds of traps applied on the project \n\nsites, training of dogs for nest search carried out; \n\n? captures were performed not only on the project sites but also in public gardens thanks to \n\nthe information spread. \n\nField work was carried out by the team of 2 people regularly joined by volunteers who helped \n\nat the different stages. Besides, there was fruitful cooperation with the members of the above \n\nmentioned institutions and the ones responsible for management of the areas of action. \n\n? evaluation and monitoring of native freshwater turtle population; \n\n? epidemiological and molecular analysis of native species so that the situation at the \n\nnational level could be understood and better conservation measures developed; \n\n? diverse environmental education activities carried out mainly in the areas next to the \n\nproject sites in order to raise public awareness and prevent more releases of exotic turtle \n\nspecies into the wild; \n\n? International symposium on freshwater turtle conservation held in Vila Nova de Gaia, \n\nPortugal in May 2013. \n\n \n\n3.2.5.7 Results of captures: overall \n\n \n\nAll in all, 299 individuals of exotic species and 6594 individuals of native species were \n\ncaptured during 3 years of the project. Nasas turned out to be the most efficient technique in \n\nnative species capture whereas in exotic species capture hand capture was also very \n\nresultative (CIBIO, 2013 a; b). \n\nThe results of the captures for each trapping technique are shown in Table \u2026. \n\nTable 3.14 Results of captures for each trapping technique (CIBIO, 2013b) \n\nCapture method Captures of exotics Captures of natives \n\n2011 2012 2013 2011 2012 2013 \n\nNasa 29 42 51 2473 1862 1809 \n\nFluctuating trap 26 15 15 137 100 2 \n\nHand capture 44 24 7 28 75 57 \n\nShrimp catcher \n\ncapture \n\n16 18 12 7 4 0 \n\nTotal 115 99 85 2645 2041 1868 \n\n\n\n134 \n\n \n\nResults of captures: Exotic species \n\n \n\nAccording to CIBIO (2013b), 299 individuals of exotic species were captured on the project \n\nsites and in the public gardens: 94 % of them are Trachmeys scripta, 6 % - all the other exotic \n\nspecies (Figures A97-A98, Appendix).  \n\nThe most efficient methods of capture of exotics were the passive ones (60% of the captures, \n\nnasas \u2013 41%, fluctuating traps \u2013 19%). Hand capture \u2013 25% of out-of-water individuals and \n\ncollection with a shrimp catcher \u2013 15% which was mostly used in the public gardens. It is \n\nimportant to note that hand capture has been extremely efficient to a big extent thanks to \n\nspread of information about the project and involvement of people from various organizations \n\nsince there were a lot of cases when people brought the captured exotics to the field team. \n\n10 nests with 127 eggs were found in the area of Lagoa de S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o. \n\nIt should be noted that the numbers of captures of exotic species during 3 years, high in the 1\nst\n \n\nyear and equally lower in the next ones, could be an evidence of ongoing eradication. What is \n\nmore, the adults captured in 2012 and 2013 were mostly non-reproductive, the number of \n\njuveniles and neonates was also gradually decreasing. \n\nFurthermore, the captures and analysis helped to correct the area of Trachemys distribution \n\nwhich was adopted at the beginning of the project. It was revealed that a rather big part of its \n\npopulation is encountered in the surrounding areas of the project sites. \n\nThe biggest number of captures of exotics was observed at Lagoa de S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o (63,9%) \n\nwhich is an evidence of the fact that the lake was a point of introduction of exotic turtles and \n\nestablishment of their population here. From here they spread to the adjacent areas which are \n\nproved by the high numbers of captures at Lagoa Quinta do Lago Sul. \n\nAs a result of the project, it is said the exotic turtle species have been eradicated from the \n\nlakes of the project and adjacent areas. Moreover, their numbers have substantially decreased \n\nin Lagoa de S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o and Lagoa Quinta do Lago Sul although the species are still \n\nobserved there (Figures A99-A100, Appendix). These 2 sites are the most difficult at the task \n\nof complete eradication of the exotics since they are daily visited by people and can not be \n\nefficiently controlled. \n\n21 neonates and pregnant females found at the 2 lakes are a clear evidence of the fact that \n\ninvasion of Trachemys scripta has been stopped. Further measures of control of nesting \n\nshould be taken in the marginal zones of the lakes. \n\n\n\n135 \n\nResults of captures: Native species \n\n \n\n? European Pond Turtle Emys orbicularis \n\n \n\nAs CIBIO (2013a) states, 342 individuals of Emys orbicularis were caught at the 4 project \n\nsites, 49 of which were pregnant females that were further transported to the installations of \n\nreproduction in captivity in RIAS and Biological Park of Gaia. \n\nNumber of captures: The biggest numbers of captures are at Lagoa de S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o and \n\nLagoa da Quinta do Lago Sul where presence of exotic turtle species is more evident (Table \n\nA12, Appendix). Moreover, they are of a big size, with permanent character of water regime, \n\nconstant abundance of alimentation and refuge which raises their capacity of being a suitable \n\nhabitat for bigger numbers of turtle species. \n\nProportion of sexes: Sex rate represents disequilibrium, with 1:0.80 male-female rate \n\nalthough the species is polygamy, so it would be more preferable and logical to have more \n\nfemale individuals. \n\nAge groups: Determination of age is a difficult task, thus, approximation by the dorsal \n\nlongitude and weight is made. It is considered neonates are&lt;40mm and&lt;20gr, juveniles \n\n>40mm&lt;100mm, adults >100mm. \n\nAdults are dominant in the structure of captures (76.8%), juveniles \u2013 16.7%, neonates \u2013 6.5%. \n\nIt is important to note that the used type of traps (floating traps) complicates capture of \n\nneonates, so mostly all of them were caught by hand on the margins of the lakes. Their \n\npresence indicates that the species reproduces successfully. \n\nThe results of captures per each lake are presented in Chapter 3.2.5, Appendix. \n\n \n\n? Mediterranean turtle Mauremys leprosa \n\n \n\nIt was known that this species\u2019 populations are extremely high in coastal Algarve lakes \n\n(CIBIO, 2013a). \n\nThe results show high population density of Mauremys leprosa in the 4 action areas which \n\nconfirms the above mentioned information. The biggest concentration is noticed in Lagoa das \n\nDunas Douradas. Together with Lagoa do Garr\u00e3o these locations show the smallest numbers \n\nof the exotic turtle species (Table A13, Appendix). So, there may be some connection \n\n\n\n136 \n\nbetween the elevated number of Mauremys leprosa and the reduced number of Trachemys \n\nscripta. \n\nMoreover, numbers of males and females are in quite equilibrium, as well as numbers of \n\nadults and juveniles (CIBIO, 2013a). \n\nAll in all, the results demonstrate that the species represents stable and healthy populations \n\nwhich guarantees their well-being at a short term. It can be concluded that effects of invasive \n\nexotic turtle species on the Mediterranean turtle are hardly seen or can not be felt yet. \n\n \n\nDiscussion \n\nDuring the project it was seen, as expected, that the populations of Emys orbicularis are in a \n\nrather preoccupying situation, showing low density, ageing and fragmented character of \n\ndistribution. \n\nIn case of Mauremys leprosa, although the situation is much better and stable, there is still \n\npreoccupation about the influence of the exotic species on its populations. More informative \n\nconclusions could be obtained with long-term monitoring of the situation. \n\nIt is important to understand that the data obtained are the first detailed description of real \n\nsituation of native turtles\u00b4 populations in Portugal. Moreover, Algarve is one of the most \n\nfavorable areas for both species. So, these data serve as a useful instrument and evidence of \n\nnecessity for the conservation actions that could be taken in the future. \n\nAll in all, the project has been not only a scientific initiative but a public environmental \n\ncampaign. Besides efficient eradication actions in the Algarve freshwater lakes and analysis \n\nof the native turtles\u00b4 situation, the population has been educated on the issue of consequences \n\nof releases of the exotic species and opportunities of cooperation with the project centres \n\n(through communication with the research team, information borads set next to the project \n\nsites, tv news on the project). The project has been important for future research and \n\nconservation actions planned in the areas involved. \n\n  \n\n\n\n137 \n\n3.3 Sociological survey \u201cAwareness about the wetland protected sites and their \n\nattractiveness for potential tourists\u201d \n \n\nGoals of the survey \n\n \n\nThe survey was carried out in Belarus and Portugal with the aim to evaluate the level of \n\npeople\u2019s awareness about wetland protected sites and their attractiveness for the participants \n\nas potential tourists. The data taken for evaluation were as follows: \n\n? general knowledge about the wetland protected sites; \n\n? awareness about wetlands (their various types: marshes, fens and bogs) as ecosystems and \n\nunderstanding of their functions, value;  \n\n? knowledge about wetland protected sites, their role for nature and people, negative and \n\npositive aspects of their natur \n\n? e conservation and tourism activities; \n\n? knowledge about the thesis research sites (Sporava fen mire, Je?nia bog, Zvaniec fen mire, \n\nPaul de Arzila, Paul da Tornada, Paul do Boquilobo) and their activities; opinions on their \n\nnature conservation and tourism performance. \n\nThe results of the survey are described in Chapter 4.1.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n138 \n\n4 Results \n\n \n\n4.1 Sociological survey: Analysis of the results \n\n \n\nParticipants of the survey \u2013 51 Belarusians, 40 Portuguese; this number turned out to be \n\nsufficient for obtaining efficient results. \n\n1. By the type of activity among both countries\u2019 participants prevail those not connected with \n\nnature conservation, tourism or environmental education (Figure 4.1). This was a desirable \n\nresult since it provides a high possibility of getting the indicators of real awareness level \n\nabout the research issues; \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 Distribution of participants by the type of activity: a \u2013 Belarus, b \u2013 Portugal \n\n2. The question of the Belarusian survey \u201cwhich protected areas would you advise for a visit \n\nto see Belarusian nature and which ones have you visited by yourself\u201d has showed the \n\nknowledge about 23 protected areas.  \n\nThe most frequently mentioned areas are Bielave\u017eskaja pu\u0161?a (the most ancient Belarusian \n\nand European forests), Biarezinski biosphere reserve, the research sites of Je?nia and \n\nSpora\u00faski. \n\nThe similar question but focusing on the wetlands in the Portuguese survey \u201cwhich wetlands \n\ndo you know in Portugal\u201d has produced 33 mentioned wetland protected areas.  \n\nThe most frequently mentioned are Ria Formosa, Tagus Estuary, Ria de Aveiro.  \n\nThe research sites Paul de Arzila, Paul da Tornada, Paul do Boquilobo are very rarely \n\nmentioned. \n\nDue to difference in the focus of the questions, it is difficult to compare the results \n\nquantitavely. However, the mention frequency of the research sites can be easily assessed \n\n(Figures A105-A106, Appendix). \n\n\n\n139 \n\nResponses to a series of questions on territorial distribution of the country\u2019s wetlands and \n\ntheir role and functions for nature and people have brought about the following results: for \n\nboth Belarus and Portugal identical values of 58% aware and 42% not aware of the facts \n\nstated (Figure 4.2). \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2 Awareness of both Belarusian and Portuguese respondents about the territorial \n\ndistribution of wetlands, their role and functions for nature and people \n\n \n\nAll in all, the awareness level in this case can be generalized to being 50/50 in both countries \n\nwhich is a good result. \n\n \n\n3. The level of awareness about the thesis research sites and activities (nature conservation, \n\ntourism, educational) organized on them has been reflected in the following results: \n\n \n\nBelarus \n\nFigures 4.3-4.5 show answers to the series of questions on the knowledge about the sites, their \n\nfeatures and events organized: \n\n \n\na b \n\nFigure 4.3 Awareness of the Belarusian respondents about a.

Moreover, Belarusian \n\nresponses have shown a high knowledge of the activities organized in the reserves. \n\n4. Final part of the results \u2013 responses to the questions on positive and negative aspects of the \n\nresearch sites\u00b4 activities (conservation, tourism, education), reasons and suggestions for \n\nimprovement of their performance. In addition to the 3 Portuguese reserves, the same \n\nquestion was asked about the most frequently mentioned wetland site of Ria Formosa with \n\nexpectation of more active responses. The results are shown in Table 4.1. \n\n \n\nTable 4.1 Positive and negative aspects of the research sites\u2019 activities and suggestions for \nimrpovements by the respondents \n\nProtected wetland \n\nsite \n\n+ - Suggestions \n\nSpora\u00faski ? biodiversity, beauty of the \nlandscape; \n\n? good opportunities for \nrecreation, visits to the mire; \n\n? inforcentre, trail, guest house; \n? active administration; \n? mowing \n\n? overgrowth of the Jasie?da \nfloodplain; \n\n? unregular work regime of the \ninforcentre; \n\n? low interest of local authorities (is \nnot fully true); \n\n? low ecotourism development; \n? biting insects \n\n? more mowers at the Spora\u00faskija \nsenakosy hand mowing \n\nchampionship \n\nZvaniec ? scale (size) of the mire, \nbiodiversity, rare species of plants \n\nand birds ; \n\n? visits to the mire; \n\n? passiveness of the reserve \nadministration; \n\n? long walk/road to the mire; \n? overgrowth with bushes; \n\n \n\n39.50% \n\n60.50% \n\nAware\n\nNot aware\n\n\n\n142 \n\n? islands in the middle of the \nmire \n\n? low ecotourism development \n \n\nJe?nia ? beauty and scale of the \nlandscape, biodiversity; \n\n? water purity, lake; \n? visits to the bog; \n? active members of the reserve \nadministration; \n\n? visit-centre, ecotrail, cross-\ncountry vehicle; \n\n? project on Je?nia conservation; \n? \u00abhow the earth moves under \nthe feet, eat overwintered \n\ncranberries\u00bb \n\n? long and difficult access to the bog; \n? use of the cross-country vehicles on \nthe bog damages plants and upper \n\nsoil layer; \n\n? lack of locals\u2019 awareness; \n? frequent traces of human (rubbish); \n? lack of accommodation services; \n? fires \n \n\n \n\n    \n\nPaul de Arzila  ? lack of infrastructure ? urgent management measures \nPaul da Tornada  ? lack of infrastructure ? urgent management measures \nPaul do \n\nBoquilobo \n? biodiversity ? lack of infrastructure ? urgent management measures \n\nRia Formosa ? biodiversity, possibilities of \nbirdwatching \n\n? pollution by human activities; \n? low accessibility; \n? lack of promotion; \n? lack investment; \n? illegal fishing \n\n? water quality control; \n? ecosystem observation; \n? infrastructure improvement (there is \nno direct road from Faro, although it \n\nexists); \n\n? prohibition of agricultural activities, \nwastewater discharge; \n\n? more efficient info promotion about \nthe events and projects; \n\n? more infoboards with maps; \n? improving organization of visits, \ntrails; \n\n? increase of ecological awareness \nand information provision of tourism \n\nbusiness representatives \n\n \n\nAdditionally, there was a question of the Portuguese survey about all the continental Ramsar \n\nwetlands, whether know/visited or not, what respondents know about them and what would \n\nlike to improve (Table 4.2).

There is a clear evidence of the ongoing penetration \nof pollutants into the marshes causing vegetation \n\nchange due to overgrowth and landscape \n\ndegradation. \n\nPublic \n\nawareness \n\naverage Belarusian level of awareness \n\nabout the research sites is very high (82 \n\n%, Sporava and Je?nia are the most \nknown) \n\naverage Portuguese awareness level about the \n\nresearch sites and conservation activities together is \n\n32% which is a very low indicator \n\nOverall \nperformance \n\nAll the 3 reserves show a positive nature \n\nconservation and tourism development \n\nperformance:  \n\n? researches have been done for \ndetermination of the most serious threats \n\nand their causes; \n\n? a complex approach to management \nhas been applied (administrations of the \n\nreserves are the first result of productive \n\ncooperation between state and non-state \n\nentities, there were set aims of \n\nrestoration of habitats and hydrological \n\nregime); \n\n? active conservation measures \nimplemented regularly and efficient \n\nresults reached; \n\n? conditions for ecotourism provided \nand improved regularly; \n\n? local population is involved; \n? promotion of the sites is carried out, \npublic, educational, conservation events \n\nare held in the reserves regularly; \n\n? cooperation with NGOs, universities, \nlocal authorities and government has \n\nbeen established. \n\nThus, there is a tendency of stable \n\nThe 2 reserves (Paul de Arzila, Paul do Boquilobo) \n\nshow a poor nature conservation and tourism \n\ndevelopment performance:  \n\n? researches have been done for determination of \nnecessary actions which were stated in the \n\nManagement Plans; \n\n? an approach of conservation of natural values but \nwithout aim of restoration was taken as a basis; \n\n? due to lack of investment and neglect by the \ngovernment few conservation measures have been \n\nimplemented in the recent 20 years; \n\n? low sustainability of the projects implemented \nearlier, continuation of landscape degradation; \n\n? some conditions for ecotourism provided but not \nimproved with the time; \n\n? local population is not involved; \n? promotion of the sites is almost absent, tourism is \nnot seen as a priority; \n\n? cooperation with NGOs, universities, local \nauthorities, but low. \n\nPaul da Tornada has shown a positive performance in \n\nvarious aspects such  as development of modern \n\nmanagement concept and proper planning of actions: \n\n? conservation measures taken, monitoring of habitats \nplanned but not conducted; \n\n? tourism facilities improved with time; \n\n\n\n147 \n\nprogressive development of the reserves \n\nas both centres of landscape conservation \n\nand ecotourism destinations. \n\nMoreover, efficient contacts have been \n\nbuilt with various organisations. \n\nHowever, the reserves rely financially on \n\nforeign funds which makes them \n\ndependent on this type of funding and \n\ndoes not allow to plan for a long-term. \n\n? priorities of both conservation and \necotourism/education set; \n\n? regular control of the work done and actions revised \nbut slow process of plan implementation; \n\n? lack of long-term investment; \n? low visible efficiency of the measures implemented \nby now. \n\nThus, there is a tendency of stagnant development of \n\nthe 2 reserves as both centres of landscape \n\nconservation and ecotourism destinations (Paul de \n\nArzila, Paul do Boquilobo). \n\nHowever, there is a positive tendency of progressive \n\nbut slow and difficult to foresee development of Paul \n\nda Tornada reserve. \n\nAll the reserves face lack of governmental interest \n\nand financial support resulting in lack of people\u2019s \nmotivation for active work. \n\n \n\nThe information obtained for each criteria can also be represented from the point of view of \n\nsimilarities/differences between the research sites of 2 countries.

Discussion and Conclusion \n \n\nA multilateral research on the issue was carried out in the process of writing the thesis. \n\nMethodology was developed to conduct the analysis of each research site. The objectives set \n\nat the beginning of the work were met. Both theoretical and practical aspects of the wetland \n\nsites performance were studied. All the sites were visited personally and contacts with the \n\nadministration members were established to get the information on current development of \n\nthe reserves from the direct source.  \n\nThe characterization of the research sites was complex and balanced and served as a reliable \n\nbasis for the consequent comparative analysis. It allowed to evaluate their nature conservation \n\nperformance rather efficiently. However, the author understands that the information analysed \n\nand the results obtained  can only partially reflect the realities of the site since it is hard to \n\nmake a really thruthful evaluation of the 7 wetland sites from the point of view of the student \n\nresearcher and after a seven-month work. Moreover, biological aspects of the wetland \n\ndevelopment were especially difficult to describe since the author does not have a degree in \n\nthis field, that is why studies, instructions and opinions of various experts were often used for \n\nthe work, detailed questions were posed to the administration members of the reserves. The \n\nwork was planned not as a biological research but as a multilateral analysis of various aspects \n\nof nature conservation performance of the research sites.  \n\nWhat is more, positive experience of the Portuguese sites was meant to be obtained for the \n\nBelarusian practices in wetland conservation. This aim has been partially implemented since \n\nBelarusian examples turned out to be more successful than the Portuguese ones by their long-\n\nterm efficiency. However, the information obtained during the research served for the \n\nunderstanding of both countries\u2019 realities in the field of wetland conservation and analysis of \n\nvarious approaches that can be applied to the research sites. \n\nTo sum up, general level of awareness about the wetland protected areas among Belarusian \n\nand Portuguese participants of the survey can be assessed as 50/50 which is a rather positive \n\nindicator. \n\nHowever, awareness about the wetland research sites of the thesis, their value and \n\nprojects/activities organised is rather high in Belarus and very low in Portugal. This can be \n\nexplained by the fact that mire (fens and bogs) conservation in Belarus has been a priority for \n\nthe recent 20 years, is very active and efficient at the level on nature conservation, education \n\nand tourism, whereas in Portugal the level of investment and focus on such areas is much \n\nlower. \n\n\n\n150 \n\nThe survey has shown drawbacks of the reserves\u2019 performance in both countries: lack of \n\ninfrastructure, lack of investment (Portugal), inefficient information distribution and \n\npromotion, landscape degradation and lack of conservation projects (Portugal), passiveness of \n\nthe reserves\u2019 administration and neglect by local and state authorities. \n\n*The survey can be assessed as efficient judging by its results but in the process of the \n\nanalysis it was observed that a more precise form of the questions and their goals is needed to \n\nreceive better results. This could be corrected in the further work and possibly the conduct of \n\nthe second more detailed survey on the issue. \n\nThe comparative analysis conducted as a result of the work on each wetland site brought \n\nabout the following conclusions: \n\n? the history of wetlands\u2019 formation has been different but further history of their use, \n\ndisturbance by man and the consequences is rather similar; \n\n? protection statuses of \u201czakaznik\u201d and \u201creserva\u201d are similar by the objectives of their \n\ncreation and development but the Belarusian one poses fewer limitations, thus providing \n\nspace for active nature conservation activities. The Portuguese regulations for the reserve \n\nfocus on complete limitation of the use of resources and human intervention of any type \n\nthrough zoning which is not present in Belarus; \n\n? by the factor of uniqueness, the Belarusian sites show more outstanding features whereas \n\nthe Portuguese ones turn out to be less attractive by their natural values due to their \n\nprogressive degradation, loss of unique flora and fauna, and passive conservation and tourism \n\ndevelopment (difficult access to observation points); \n\n? by the threats, the reserves have shown similar biological factors of disturbance which \n\nresult from the past human alteration but their influence and scope are different, much less in \n\nBelarus due to active conservation measures taken, whereas in Portugal these factors have \n\nprogressed further to the negative side; \n\n? by management Belarusian sites are characterized by a complex management concept \n\nbased on sustainability principles (management units created in the reserves, nature \n\nconservation, involvement of local people, cooperation with local and governmental \n\nauthorities, NGO). Although in Portugal all the sites are also under control of their \n\nadministrtions, 1 site (Paul da Tornada) has shown the complex approach to management \n\nfocused on environmental education and 2 other sites are characterized by the lack of high \n\nquality management, especially in the field of nature conservation activities; \n\n\n\n151 \n\n? by nature conservation and ecotourism activities, the Belarusian sites have shown \n\nactiveness and efficient results in the recent 20 years (restoration of habitats, hydrological \n\nregime, raising public awareness and attractiveness for potential tourists) whereas in Portugal \n\nthe 2 sites do not show efficient results of conservation or restoration due to lack of \n\nconservation measures and neglect of ecotourism potential, and 1 site with environmental \n\nNGO administration has shown positive planning of both conservation and \n\necotourism/education actions and their slow but progressive implementation; \n\n? however, there were observed similar problems in ecotourism development such as lack of \n\npromotion, information borads and signs in the reserves of both countries; \n\n? by the level of public awareness about the wetlands in general and the research sites in \n\nparticular, Belarus has shown a much higher result than Portugal which can be explained by \n\nthe active conservation and ecotourism development practices and their promotion in Belarus \n\nin the recent 20 years, and lack of public informing and involvement in the reserves\u2019 \n\ninitiatives nd plans; \n\n? approaches to freshwater wetland conservation in Belarus and Portugal have turned out to \n\nbe different by their priority aims: restoration of habitats and hydrological regime, ecotourism \n\npromotion in Belarus and conservation of natural values without obligatory restoration of \n\nhabitats and hydrological regime, just prevention from further degradation in Portugal; \n\n? the Belarusian wetlands have shown a much better performance both in nature \n\nconservation and separately in ecotourism development if to judge from the point of the \n\nBelarusian approach to wetland conservation. Even judging from the Portuguese one, the \n\nPortuguese sites have not succeded in prevention of landscape degradation but 2 of them have \n\nshown stangnancy and passiveness in their development, 1 site has done proper analysis and \n\nplanning of actions which are slowly implemented by the environmental NGO.  \n\nThe focus of the problem in Portugal is usually put on lack of investment which is difficult to \n\nget but, from the author\u2019s point of view, motivation and interest of the authorities, both local \n\nand governmental, and employees of the protected areas play a significant role. What is more, \n\nlocal initiatives of sites\u2019 administrations that do not require a lot of funds are also a solution. \n\nBelarusian research sites also face lack of governmental interest and dependency on foreign \n\nfinancial support but motivation and enthusiasm of the people involved, and properly planned \n\nmanagement schemes are key factors of ongoing progress which allow to get over the \n\nbureaucratic and financial barriers. \n\n\n\n152 \n\nHowever, the author clearly understands that the difference in the performance of the wetland \n\nsites in 2 countries has been caused not only by the above mentioned factors but by the \n\ngeneral economic conditions and governmental policies of the countries as well as by the \n\nhistorical preconditions of the current approaches to wetland conservation. \n\nThus, the present thesis has allowed the author to get valuable experience in the research of \n\nwetland sites of Belarus and Portugal, expand the view on wetland conservation methods, \n\nparticipate in the ongoing conservation projects and present the results of the comparative \n\nanalysis in the work. \n\n  \n\n\n\n153 \n\nReferences \n\n \nAAAS Atlas of Population and Environment (2014) Freshwater wetlands [online].

The \n\nvalues obtained in 2008 were 1.2-2.9 MAC for NH4, 1.1-3.6 for N-NO2, MAC \u2013 \nmaximum acceptable concentration. This is an evidence of permanent pollution in the \n\npast and present which has severe consequences for the Sporava mire as a landscape and \n\nhabitat. \n\nWhat is more, the Jasie?da River gets 10 thousand m3 of sewage every day which 90% \nof the regional indicator. Wastewater treatment plant in the area of the mire does not yet \n\nfunction properly although construction and repair works have been conducted for a \n\nlong period of time. \n\n \n\nPeat analysis \n\n \nAnalysis of peat was made through analysis of peat ph values from 2010 research data \n\nand assessment of von Post Decomposition Index. \n\nPeat ph in Sporava mire, since it is a fen mire, must be weakly acidic, neutral or weakly \n\nalkaline: it gets minerals (N, K, P) from the groundwater and is nutrient-rich, its ph is \n\nusually 5.5-8. \n\nThe 2010 research data results show the 3 following ph values for peat: 5.51, 5.72, 5.56 \n\nwith an average of 5.60. \n\nThe values obtained are in the normal range for fen mires showing that peat is weakly \n\nacidic which means it does not reflect any eutrophication processes caused by drainage \n\nand discharge of pollutants into the Jasie?da River. This can further mean that either \npeat will show more \u201calkaline\u201d values in the future due to ongoing accumulation or the \npollution levels are very low. \n\n \n\nVon Post Decomposition Index is H4 \u2013 weakly decomposed: plant structure still \ndistinct, yields strongly turbid water, no peat substance passes between fingers, residue \n\nrather mushy. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\nWetland condition analysis \n \nWetland name: Sporava fen mire  \nRegion: Brest region, Biaroza, Ivanava, Ivacevi?y and Drahi?yn districts, Belarus \nDate: 30.03.12 \n\n \n\nClassification: I System IA Subsystem II Wetland Class II Wetland Form \n\nPalustrine Permanent Fen Floodplain \n \n\nIndicator Indicator \nComponents \n\nSpecify and Comment Score \n0-5 \n\nMean \nScore \n\nChange in \n\nhydrological \n\nintegrity \n\nImpact of \n\nmanmade \n\nstructures \n\nDrainage conducted in the 1970-80s.

The research was \n\nconducted after the period of high precipitation, thus, for the accuracy of the results, it \n\nmakes sense to repeat the measurements in the midperiod of average precipitation.  \n\nThe following parameters were measured during the research: \n\n? Conductivity; \n? Ph; \n? Groundwater level, \n? Mineralization; \n? Oxidability; \n\nThese are the obtained research results for 11 research points: \n\n \n\nWater quality indicators \n\n \n\n \n  \n\nThe values obtained allow us to make the following conclusions: \n\n? Hydrochemical parameters are in the normal range typical of Belarusian bogs \n(low mineralization, low conductivity, strongly acidic); \n\n? The highest values of mineralization are for points 1, 2, 3 which correspond with \nthe disturbed parts of the Du?ski canal, and for point 6 in the south of the \nreserve; \n\n? Ph values are at their highest limit for bogs; \n? Oxidability is the highest at the bog edges which is explained by the fact that \n\nthere is a higher water flow in those areas. \n\nThe analysis of groundwater level at various locations proves that there are areas that \n\nshow a rather high level of disturbance (-10, -15 cm on average) which is a clear \n\nevidence of negative consequences of the past human activities. However, dam \n\nconstruction contributed to rise of the groundwater level and restoration of the \n\nhydrological regime of the bog. \n\n \n\nPeat analysis \n\n \n\nAnalysis of peat was made through analysis of peat ph values from 2010 research data \n\nand assessment of von Post Decomposition Index. \n\nPeat ph in Je?nia bog, since it is a raised bog, must be strongly acidic: absence of \nalkaline components from the organic material, precipitation prevails over evaporation, \n\nSensor \n\n? \nMineralizat\n\nion, mg/l \n\nConductivity, \n\nms/cm \n\nTemp, \n\n\u00baC \n\nAcidity, Ph GWL, \n\ncm \n\nAcids, \n\nmg/l \n\nRedox \n\npotential, mV \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\nanthropogenic factors (deposition of acidic pollutants from the atmosphere), peat is \n\nnutrient-poor, its ph is usually 3-4. \n\nThe 2010 research data results show the 3 following ph values for peat: 3.0, 2.9, 3.07 \n\nwith an average of 2.99. \n\nThe values obtained are in the normal range for bogs which means peat is very acidic \n\nand does not reflect any evidence of its deterioration due to disturbance of hydrological \n\nregime. \n\n \n\nVon Post Decomposition Index is has been measured for 3 locations: \n\n? Lake Bielaje \u2013 H5 \u2013 moderately decomposed: plant structure still clear but \nbecoming indistinct, yields much turbid brown water, some peat escapes \n\nbetween fingers, residue very mushy; \n\n? 300 m from the drainage canal \u2013 H4 \u2013 weakly decomposed: plant structure \ndistinct, yields strongly tubid water, no peat passes between fingers, residue \n\nrather mushy; \n\n? Lake Kurhanistaje (between the tussocks) \u2013 H1 \u2013 undecomposed: plant structure \nunaltered, yields only clear colourless water. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\nWetland condition analysis \n?  \n\nWetland name: Je?nia raised bog  \nRegion: Viciebsk region, Mijory and \u0160arka\u00fa\u0161?yna districts, Belarus \nDate: 25.03.12 \n\n \n\nClassification: I System IA Subsystem II Wetland Class II Wetland Form \n\nPalustrine Permanent Bog Floodplain \n\n  \n\nIndicator Indicator \nComponents \n\nSpecify and Comment Score \n0-5 \n\nMean \nScore \n\nChange in \n\nhydrological \n\nintegrity \n\nImpact of manmade \n\nstructures \n\nDrainage conducted in the 1960s.

Information board  \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \n\nWater quality analysis \n\n \nWater quality analysis has been carried out with the help of two information sources: \n\nthe research of 1999 and the 2011 the data of the National System of Information on \n\nHydrological Resources. Therefore, it consists of two parts: the one with the 1999 \n\nresults and the other with the 2011 data. \n\n \n\nPart 1 \nThe 1999 research was on control of vegetation expansion in the marshes of the Lower \n\nMondego, and in particular, on improvement of habitat management for aquatic birds in \n\nPaul de Arzila. \n\n \n\nThere were chosen 8 sampling points in the area of the paul. They are shown on the map \n\nbelow (Figure A55). \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \n\n \nFigure A55. Sampling points in the Paul de Arzila \n\n \n\n1 \u2013 Ribeira da Malga \u2013 the point of release of two effluents from the industries of the \nregion \u2013 one on meat production and the other on ceramics production (which is now \nterminated). Thus, potentially the most polluted point; \n\n2 \u2013 Ribeira de Cernache \u2013 located next to the village of Sobreiro which is subjected to \nagricultural and domestic pollution; \n\n3 \u2013 Ponte de Melhora \u2013 the point where two principal water lines of the River Cernache \nmeet, subjected to agricultural, industrial and domestic pollution; \n\n4 \u2013 Vala dos Moinhos (Casal das Figueiras) \u2013 entrance to the reserve, just on the border \nof the paul, agricultual and domestic pollution; \n\n5 \u2013 Vala do Meio \u2013 Casal das Figueiras \u2013 next to Vala dos Moinhos, one of the three \nditches in the paul, agriculture is the main pollutant; \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\n6 \u2013 Vala da Costa (Casal das Figueiras) \u2013 subjected to agricultural pollution, its waters \ndirectly enter the paul; \n\n7 \u2013 Dique (dam) \u2013 located at the exit from the paul being an important point to compare \nthe water quality entering and leaving the area; \n\n8 \u2013 Vala dos Moinhos \u2013 exit, is not located within the reserve. \n \n\nThus, points 1, 2, 3 are located in the long distance from the paul, 4, 5, 6 are at the \n\nentrance to the paul, and 7,8 are at the exit. \n\n \n\nThe samples were taken monthly during the year of 1999. The following parameters \n\nwere assessed at each point: ph, temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, nitrates, \n\nphosphates, ammonia. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \n\nResults \n \n\nPh \u2013 ph values vary during the year identically for all the points except for point 1 \n(Ribeira da Malga) and point 7 (Dique) which have the lowest values due the certain \n\nlevel of industrial pollution (point 1) and circulation difficulties (point 7) due to \n\nopening/closing of the gates. However, the values are not critically bad, they are in \n\nnormal range of 7-8 (Figure A56). \n\n \nFigure A56. Ph values at the sampling points in the area of Paul de Arzila \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n\nDissolved O2 \u2013 seasonal variations at all the points (the higher the temperature the less \noxygen it contains and vice versa), the highest values registered in the raining season \n\nwhen the water flow is at its maximum. 5 mg/l is considered to be a minimum normal \n\nlevel. Points 1, 7, and 8 have the lowest values which can mean there are pollutants \n\naccumulated in the water and causing poor O2 saturation (Figure A57). \n\n \nFigure A57. Dissolved oxygen values at the sampling points in the area of Paul de \n\nArzila \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \n\nConductivity \u2013 highest in the summer when the temperatures are high and the water \nflow is low. Normal level range is 200-1000 us/cm. Point 1 again has the highest values \n\ndue to the certain pollution level (Figure A58). \n\n \nFigure A58. Conductivity values at the sampling points in the area of Paul de Arzila \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\nQuantity of nutrients (ammonia, nitrates, nitrites, phosphates) \u2013 Figures A59-A62.  \nNitrates normal range is less than 5 mg/l \u2013 all the points show positive values, except \nfor single higher than 5 mg/l values at points 2 and 3 in June; \n\nPhosphates normal range is less than 0.54 mg/l \u2013 very high values (with maximum \nvalue of 3 mg/l) during all the year at point 1; \n\nAmmonia normal range is less than 0.10 mg/l \u2013 higher than normal at points 1, 3, 5, 7, \npoint 1 having maximum value of  2 mg/l. \n\nPoint 1 values reflect high level of accumulated pollutants whereas at other points the \n\nvalues are mostly in a normal range, with seasonal variations. \n\n \n\n \nFigure A59. Nitrates values at the sampling points in the area of Paul de Arzila \n\n\n\n68 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure A60.

Ammonia values at the sampling points in the area of Paul de Arzila \n\n \n\nIt is therefore obvious that except for point 1, water indicators for the other points in the \n\npaul particularly do not have the evidence of serious deterioration because of the nearby \n\npollutants. Moreover, as for 1999, the values at distance points and at the entrance to the \n\npaul are far worse than at the exit from the paul (Figures A63-A64).  \n\n\n\n71 \n\n \n\n \nFigure A63.

Nitrogen compounds levels at the entrance and exit from the Paul de Arzila \n\n \n\nAnyway, probably evidence of accumulation is only a question of time since there is \n\nanother non-quantative evidence of pollution such as emergent vegetation of reedbed, \n\nwillow which means pollutants have been accumulating and causing extremely active \n\nvegetation growth and accumulation of organic material and its decomposition, which \n\nfurther means water eutrophication and wetland habitat transformation into a forest \n\nland. What is more, the above described values are the results of the 1999 research, \n\nfurther analysis of the 2011 data will be very helful since it will provide an opportunity \n\nof comparison and making a more sensible conclusion on the aspect of water quality \n\ndegradation in Paul de Arzila. \n\n \n\nPart 2 \nThe National Information System on Hydrological Resources provides information on \n\ntwo sampling points \u2013 point 3 (Ponte de Melhora) from the previous research and one \npoint next to the village of Lameira de Baixo and Vala dos Moinhos, called Arzila, in \n\nthe middle part of the paul. Thus, we have one point next to the pollution sources and \n\n\n\n72 \n\n \n\nthe other directly in the paul. We will compare all the parameters of these 2 points with \n\none another and with the values of the same points in 1999*. \n\n \n\n*Ponte Melhora is the same point in 1999 and 2011 data. Arzila point of 2011 is to the \n\nnorth of Vala dos Moinhos of 1999 but they are both inside the paul, not in a long \n\ndistance and disturbed by the same factors, thus they can be taken for comparison. \n\n \n\nResults \nTable A10.

There were elevations in 2003-2004, 2006, 2008-2010 \n\nbut this paramter does not seem to reflect any siginificant change. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n75 \n\n \n\nConductivity values at Ponte Melhora have not changed much if compare 1999 and 2011 values there was observed a \n\nsignificant increase in 2002-2004 and 2006-2009 which reflects an elevation in pollution levels. \n\n \n\nThere are no big changes between conductivity levels in 1999 and 2011 but there were periods of serious elevations of its values \n\nwhich can mean increase in pollution levels. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nThere has been an increase in nitrates levels at Arzila from a range of 0.3-3.9 to the one 6-15 which is a drastic change and \n\nevidence of serious pollution of the area. Unfortunately, there are no results on the levels development in the years of 2000 -\n\n2010 but today\u2019s results show habitat deterioration inside the paul without any measures having been taken. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nThe level of nitrates at Ponte Melhora has increased from the range of 2.5-7 to 5-15 which is a drastic change and possible \n\nconsequence of uncontrolled pollution. \n\n \n\nThe nitrates levels at the 2 points were in different ranges in 1999 but evened dramatically by 2012. This can be the evidence of \n\nongoing pollution which has now reached the paul itself and still no measures have been taken to put it under control. \n\n\n\n76 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 111. \n\nPhosphate levels at Arzila have experienced an increase in their values in 1999-2011 from a range of 0.01-0.14 to 0.10-0.40. \n\nUnfortunately, there are no results for the years of 2000-2010 but it is important to note that there has been a drastic increase in \n\nphosphates in 2012, values reaching its possible maximum which can be an evidence of high amount of nutrients in the water \n\nand its quality being very poor not only outside the paul but already inside the paul. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nThere has been an increase in phosphates levels at Ponte Melhora, from the range of 0.05-0.4 to the one of 0.10-0.50. Moreover, \n\nthere have been elevations till critical levels of 0.9 in 2012. All this proves high speed of pollution penetration inside the paul. \n\n \n\nIn 1999 the phosphates levels at the 2 points were in different ranges, Ponte Melhora having much higher values which was \n\nnormal sicne it is closer to pollution sources. In 2011 these ranges became the same with an increase for Arzila point. Moreover, \n\na drastic elevation in 2012 was observed at both points, with a time difference of 6-7 months, Ponte Melhora being obviously \n\nthe first to have it. All this can be the consequence of an ongoing pollution which has not been put under control. \n\n\n\n77 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nIncrease in ammonia level at Arzila has been observed in 1999-2011, with drastic elevations in 2001-2003, 2005-2008 and \n\nvalues in a normal range in 2011. However, this is a clear evidence of active continuous pollution penetration into the paul.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \nIncrease in ammonia levels at Ponte Melhora has been observed, with drastic elevations in 2001-2003 ans 2010-2012 which is a \n\nproof of high pollution levels. \n\n \nThere can be easily observed almost identical increases in ammonia levels during 1999-2011 at the 2 points, with a time \ndifference of 1-2 months between them, Ponte Melhora being the first to experience elevations and Arzila being the second. \n\nThus, the pollution processes are obvious and deepening, penetrating into the paul. Now not only expansive vegetation growth \n\nis an indicator of pollution but the parameters themselves.There is also a clear evidence of absence of any activities on \n\nconservation of the paul and efforts to decrease the pollution levels. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n78 \n\n \n\nOverall water quality \u2013 there is a EU classification of water quality into 5 types: high, \ngood, moderate, poor, and bad (accordingly blue, green, yellow, orange and red \n\ncolours). The final judgment on the water quality type is made on the basis of \n\nassessment of several physiochemical parameters.  \n\nArzila \n\n \nFigure A65. Overall water quality at Arzila \n \n\nPonte de Melhora \n\n \nFigure A66. Overall water quality at Ponte Melhora \n \n\nJudging by these tables, water quality at Arzila inside the paul has been worse than that \n\nat Ponte Melhora where water is supposed to be more polluted due to the nearby \n\nindustries. This could mean that comparing with 1999 research pollutants have \n\npenetrated further down the river flow, right into the paul, and now are visible in \n\nparameters\u2019 values. \n \n  \n\n\n\n79 \n\n \n\nWetland condition analysis \n \n\nWetland name: Paul de Arzila  \nRegion:              Portugal/Centro/Baixo Mondego \nDate:                  29-30.10.13 \n\nClassification: I System IA Subsystem II Wetland Class II Wetland Form \n\nPalustrine Permanent Marsh*  Floodplain, pool, \n\nchannel \n\n*Permanent freshwater marshes/pools; ponds (below 8 ha), marshes and swamps on inorganic soils; with emergent \nvegetation water-logged for at least most of the growing season (Tp), Ramsar classification \n\nIndicator Indicator \nComponents \n\nSpecify and Comment Score \n0-5 \n\nMean \nScore \n\nChange in \n\nhydrological \n\nintegrity \n\nImpact of manmade \n\nstructures \n\nTotally affected by manmade structures \n\n \n\n3 drainage ditches, one of them visible to \n\nvisitor; complete change of hydrological \n\nregime, vegetation and fauna communities \n\nSewage pollution by nearby industries, use \n\nof fertilizers by agriculturers \n\n0 1.67 \n\nWater table depth With abandonment of the area the water \n\ntable has increased in some parts of the \n\nwetland. \n\nHowever, significant changes have caused \n\nsoil erosion and diminution of fish flow, \n\nseasonal fluctuations with dry summer \n\nperiod. \n\n2 \n\nDryland plant \n\ninvasion \n\nVisually obvious, Salix and Phragmites \n\naustralis occupy a large part of the area \n\n(almost 50% of the paul itself) \n\n3 \n\nChange in \n\nphysicochemic\n\nal parameters \n\nFire damage No evidence of fire damage 5 3.67 \n\nDegree of \n\nsedimentation/erosion \n\nNone detected 5 \n\nNutrient levels Very high according to water quality \n\nanalysis, industrial, domestic pollution, \n\nmalfunction of wastewater treatment plants. \n\nPenetration of pollutants into the paul itself. \n\nHigh euthrophication. \n\n1 \n\nvon Post index No peat - \n\nChange in \n\necosystem \n\nintactness \n\nLoss in area of \n\noriginal wetland \n\nOver 40 % of the wetland area lost since its \n\nabandonment and due to drainage \n\nconsequences (Salix and Phragmites \n\ninvasion) \n\n3 3 \n\nConnectivity barriers App 40% of downstream connection lost  \n\nDisturbance fish flow, open pools creation \n\nand interconnection of all the pools \u2013 flow of \nnon-native species of fish and crayfish \n\n3 \n\nChange in \n\nbrowsing, \n\npredation and \n\nharvesting \n\nregimes \n\nDamage by domestic \n\nor feral animals \n\nNo big influence 5 3.67 \n\n \n\n Introduced predator \n\nimpacts on wildlife \n\nNon-native species of crayfish brought \n\nmostly to extinction two native frog species \n\n2 \n\nHarvesting levels Abandonment.

It connects the paul with the upstream \n\nvillages and has high levels of ammonia, phosphates, low levels of dissolved oxygen \n\nand evidence of fecal contamination.  \n\n \n\nHowever, it was stated that none of the sites, including the first 2 ones, satisfied the \n\nrequirements of water quality for life support of animal species. High levels of nutrients \n\nare evidence of eutrophication processes ongoing in the paul. \n\n \n\nAnalysis II \n\n \nIn 2006-2007 there was a research study on sampling microinverterbrates and assessing \n\nwater quality in the paul.  \n\nMicroinvertebrates are an indicator group for evaluation of water quality: they were \n\nsampled and Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) indicator was determined. \n\nIt turned out to be 58 in the range of 36-60 which corresponds with Contaminated \n\nWaters in the evaluation table. \n\n \n\nWater samples were taken every 15 days from November 2006 till June 2007 at two \n\npoints \u2013 Bra\u00e7o do Corti\u00e7o and Ponte do Rio Almonda (Ponta Nova), the first of them is \nright in the centre of Total Protection Area, next to the observatory, the second one is \n\nnext to the Interpretation Centre in the northern part of the reserve, at the entrance to \n\nQuinta do Paul. The difference between them is in location and waterflow speed, at \n\nBra\u00e7o do Corti\u00e7o the current is weak, the river widens there, whereas at Ponte the water \n\ncurrent is fast. The sampling sites are shown on the map below (Figure ). \n\n\n\n97 \n\n \n\n \nFigure A86. Sampling points at Paul do Boquilobo: BC - Bra\u00e7o do Corti\u00e7o, PN \u2013 Ponta \nNova \n \n\nThe samples were used to determine phosphate, nitrate and chlorophyll levels. \n\nThe 2006-2007 results will be compared with the information obtained from SNIRH. \n\nFor Bra\u00e7o Corti\u00e7o information only on 1999-2005 is available, whereas for Ponta Nova \n\nthere are 1988-2012 results. \n\n \n\nTable A11. Water quality indicators \nBra\u00e7o Corti\u00e7o Ponta Nova \n\nPhosphorous \n\n \n \n\nAverage P is 0.23 mg/l which is a maximum value of the P normal \n\nrange \n\nAverage P is 1.03 mg/l which is 5 times higher than the normal \n\nrange maximum limit of 0.2 mg/l \n\nBC \n\nPN \n\n\n\n98 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nThe P level is higher than the normal range of&lt;0.2 mg/l, with \n\nabrupt increases to >1 mg/l in 1999, 2004, 2006-2007. Average P in \n\n1999-2004 is 0.55 mg/l. This shows that the P level decreased from \n\n1999-2004 to 2006-2007 to the normal level range. \n\n \n \n\nThe P level is higher than the normal range, with average being \n\n0.42 mg/l. This means that 2006-2007 were one the peaks of P \n\nvalues but still its levels are high. \n\nP levels at Bra\u00e7o de Corti\u00e7o have turned out to decrease with time to the normal range values (from 0.55 mg/l in 1999-2004 to 0.23 mg/l \n\nin 2006-2007) whereas the Ponta Nova values have been permanently out of the normal range, 2 times higher (0.42 mg/l with peaks of \n\n1.03 mg/l in 2006-2007). This can result from the fact that that Ponta Nova is outside the paul and pollution from the nearby industries \n\nand agricultural practices is more visible here, whereas inside the paul, at Bra\u00e7o de Corti\u00e7o, waterflow is weak and nutrients are \n\naccumulating over time and either will be more visible in the future years or they are consumed by phitoplancton which is t here in great \n\namounts. \n\nChlorophyll \n\n \n \n\n47.4, 132.4. 3709.5 ug/l 35.9, 70.4, 178.6 ug/l \n\nChlorophyll values at Bra\u00e7o Corti\u00e7o are each higher than the ones at Ponta Nova which can be explained by the fact that the first point is \n\npart of a more closed system with weak waterflow and bigger amount of phytoplancton. Green colour of water at both points is an \n\nevidence of eutrophication due to pollution and invasion of water hyacinth. \n\nPhosphates \n\n \nPhosphates levels are much higher at Ponta Nova (at Bra\u00e7o Corti\u00e7o they are in the normal range, at Ponta Nova reaching critical values) \n\nwhich confirms the hypothesis about the ongoing pollution and its accumulation in the paul still not visible in PO5 values inside it but \n\nalready seen at the site outside the paul. It is important to note that the values at the 1\nst\n point are from 1999-2005 whereas Ponta Nova has \n\nthe latest values, so, there is a possibility of PO5 levels at Bra\u00e7o Corti\u00e7o already being much higher.  \n\n\n\n99 \n\n \n\nNitrates \n\n  \nNitrates levels have the same trend as phosphates, except for the values not being in the critical range, confirming the sensibility of the \n\nabove mentioned idea. \n\nAmmonia \n\n  \n\n \nAmmonia levels at Ponta Nova are much higher than those at Bra\u00e7o Corti\u00e7o, although both points show values out of the normal range, \n\nwhich, if to take into account the accumulative feature of wetlands, can mean that current values inside the paul (Bra\u00e7o Corti\u00e7o) can be \n\nmuch higher. \n\nConductivity \n\n  \nAverage conductivity levels at 2 points are in the normal range, only in some periods at Bra\u00e7o Corti\u00e7o being higher than normal but that \n\ncan not be exact proof of pollution. \n\nDissolved O2 \n\n  \nOxygen saturation is very low at both points with values lying within green-orange range which can be the evidence of eutrophication of \n\nthe area which in its turn proves that the paul suffers from ongoing pollution, drainage consequences and bad water renovation system. \n\n\n\n100 \n\n \n\nPh \n\n  \nPh levels are in the normal range. \n\nOverall water quality \n\n  \nGeneral tables are good to verify the above mentioned conclusions. Both points show poor water quality absolutely confirming the \n\ninformation about ongoing natural (consequences of artificial) processes in the paul. The water quality at Bra\u00e7o Corti\u00e7o by this table \n\nresults is even worse than the one at Ponta Nova. \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n101 \n\n \n\nWetland condition analysis \n\n \nWetland name: Paul do Boquilobo  \nRegion: Portugal/Centro/Lisboa e Vale do Tejo \nDate: 28.10.13 \n\nClassification: I System IA Subsystem II Wetland Class II Wetland Form \n\nPalustrine Seasonal Marsh* Basin, channel \n\n* Seasonal/intermittent freshwater marshes/pools on inorganic soil; includes sloughs, potholes, seasonally flooded meadows, sedge \nmarshes (Ts); Permanent freshwater marshes/pools; ponds (below 8 ha), marshes and swamps on inorganic soils; with emergent \n\nvegetation water-logged for at least most of the growing season (Tp) \n\nIndicator Indicator Components Specify and Comment Score \n0-5 \n\nMean \nScore \n\nChange in \n\nhydrological \n\nintegrity \n\nImpact of manmade \n\nstructures \n\nTotally affected by manmade \n\nstructures \n\n \n\nNew landscape of drainage ditches \n\nand lowlands between them \n\nWeak water renovation with the \n\nTagus and Almonda rivers. \n\nIndustrial pollution by nearby farms \n\n0 2.33 \n\nWater table depth Difficult to access because of \n\nartificial regulation of water level \n\nCertain decrease in the water level of \n\n25% of the paul \n\n4 \n\nDryland plant invasion Almost 50 % of area has dryland \n\nplant species present \n\nSalix sp, Phragmites australis, \n\nScirpus lacustris \n\n3 \n\nChange in \n\nphysicochemical \n\nparameters \n\nFire damage No evidence of fire damage 5 3.5 \n\nDegree of \n\nsedimentation/erosion \n\n- - \n\nNutrient levels Ongoing accumulation of pollutants \n\nHigh eutrophication due to Water \n\nHyacinth, invasive plant species, \n\nspread, and sewage and agricultural \n\npollution \n\n2 \n\nvon Post index - - \n\nChange in \n\necosystem \n\nintactness \n\nLoss in area of original \n\nwetland \n\nApp 40 % of area lost 3 3 \n\nConnectivity barriers Around 50% of downstream \n\nconnection lost \n\n3 \n\nChange in \n\nbrowsing, \n\npredation and \n\nharvesting \n\nregimes \n\nDamage by domestic or \n\nferal animals \n\nNo damage detected 5 3.33 \n\nIntroduced predator \n\nimpacts on wildlife \n\nLouisiana Crayfish \n\nHigh impact \n\n2 \n\nHarvesting levels 25-49 % of area affected by active \n\nharvesting \n\n3 \n\nChange in \n\ndominance of \n\nnative plants \n\nIntroduced plant canopy \n\ncover \n\nWater hyacinth invasion forming \n\npatches on the water \n\nAround 25% of the area \n\n4 4.5 \n\nIntroduced plant \n\nunderstorey cover \n\nNone 5 \n\nTotal wetland condition index 16.66 /25 \n\nDegree of modification assigned as follows: 5=very low/none, 4=low, 3=medium, \n\n2=high, 1=very high, 0=extreme \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n102 \n\n \n\nChapter 3.2.4 \n \n\nThe peat bogs in Portuguese mountains (Serra de Estrela, Peneda-Geres) are often \n\ndegraded due to active unsustainable use for pastures, excessive spread of nutrients that \n\nis why they are subjected to conservation measures such as construction of barriers for \n\ncattle, restoration of natural hydrology through construction of dams.

Information board set next to the project sites \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n106 \n\n \n\nKey features of the native and exotic turtle species \n \n\n1. Exotic species \n \n\nPond Slider Trachemys scripta \u2013 the most popular pet turtle in the world. It is native in \nthe east of the United States and adjacent areas in the northeast of Mexico. This species \n\nhas been released into the wild everywhere in the world. It is well-known in Europe due \n\nto its invasion into freshwater ecosystems, although in other regions of the world its \n\ndistribution is not known. \n\nIt has 3 subspecies: the most common is Red-eared slider Trachemys scripta elegans, \n\nthen goes Yellow-eared slider Trachemys scripta scripta and Cumberland slider \n\nTrachemys scripta troosti.  \n\n \nFigure A91. Subspecies of Trachemys scripta \n \n\nThe species is omnivorous with a rich diet (from insects and other invertebrates to \n\namphibians, reptiles, small mammals and birds) and represents a great capacity of \n\ndispersion through the freshwater channels, travelling long distances on land and getting \n\nover various barriers. Thus, it is a good survivor. Moreover, it is characterized by high \n\ncompetitiveness for alimentation, thermoregulation places and nesting sites. This feature \n\narises from the early sexual maturity age, high fertility, bigger size and aggressiveness if \n\ncompared to the native species. What is more, Trachemys scripta is capable of \n\nspreading diseases and parasites which can affect the native turtles, aquatic animals and \n\neven humans. \n\n \n\nOther exotic species \nUnfortunately, trade of other exotic turtle species is permitted in Portugal. These ones \n\ncan be encountered in pet shops: \n\n \nFigure A92. From left to right: River cooter Pseudemys concinna, Florida Redbelly \n\nTurtle Pseudemys nelsonii, False map turtle Graptemys pseudogeographica \n \n\n\n\n107 \n\n \n\nBesides the fact that the species are legally sold to public, they possess the same \n\ncompetitive-aggressive characteristics as Trachemys scripta. Thus, if released into the \n\nwild, they are able to cause the same negative impacts on the environment. \n\n \n\n2. Native species \n \nEuropean Pond Turtle Emys orbicularis \u2013 the smallest freshwater turtle in Europe. \nEndangered species in Portugal, rarely encountered on the Iberian Peninsula, its \n\npopulations are small and isolated. More easily found in the basins and lakes of the \n\nsouthern Portugal. \n\nIts number has significantly decreased in the last 100 years due to habitat alteration and \n\ndestruction (paludal landscapes), intentional catches and introduction of exotic species. \n\nMoreover, the species is rather fragile, sexual maturity of females is late which causes \n\nlow fertility rates together with high infant mortality rates, and further brings low \n\npopulation growth and reduced recuperation ability of the species especially in case of \n\nnegative impacts such as exotic species introduction. \n\nMediterranean Turtle Mauremys leprosa \u2013 the biggest freshwater turtle in Europe. \nQuite common in Portugal (Least concern status of protection), its biggest populations \n\nare found on the Iberian Peninsula. Well spread to the south of the River Tagus in \n\nPortugal. Encountered populations are usually of a high density although there has been \n\nnoticed reduction of the distribution area due to extinction of the certain populations. \n\nFactors of disturbance are the same as for Emys orbicularis. Illegal captures for trade or \n\nusing for alimentation have become the most serious threat to this species. Exotic \n\nspecies are also a threat although Mauremys leprosa is much stronger and more flexible \n\nin terms of survival than Emys orbicularis. \n\n \n\nFigure A93.

The \n\ndistribution of traps is shown in the figure below. \n\n \nFigure A101. A \u2013 localization of traps in Lagoa do Garr\u00e3o during 2011; B \u2013 localization \nof traps in Lagoa do Garr\u00e3o during 2013 \n \n\nThe number of recaptures (46) compared to the number of captures (22 individuals) is a \n\nhigh indicator which shows that there is a high probability the number of captured Emys \n\norbicularis is close to their real quantity. \n\nCapture of only one juvenile is a worrying result since deficit of juveniles can have \n\nserious consequences for renewal of the population. However, capture of 2 pregnant \n\nfemales is a positive fact which can mean that the low number of captured juveniles can \n\nresult from abundant vegetation in the lake being a good refuge for the species and from \n\nthe type of traps used. \n\n \n\nLagoa das Dunas Douradas \n6 nasas and 6 fluctuating traps were placed in the lake in 2011; \n\nIn 2012 due to a drastic fall of the water level 3 nasas and all the fluctuating traps were \n\nremoved, with only 3 nasas left; \n\nIn 2013 due to the still low water level 3 nasas remained in the lake, no more traps were \n\nplace there. The distribution of the traps is shown in the figure below. \n\n \nFigure A102. A \u2013 localization of traps in Lagoa das Dunas Douradas during 2011; B \u2013 \nlocalization of traps in Lagoa das Dunas Douradas during 2012 and 2013 \n\n \n\n\n\n113 \n\n \n\nThe number of recaptures (104) again has a very high value in comparison to the \n\nnumber of captures (39 individuals) which means this number of the individuals of \n\nEmys orbicularis is rather close to reality. \n\nSimilar to Lagoa do Garr\u00e3o, there is a low number of juveniles captured but 2 pregnant \n\nfemales which, taking into account closeness of Lagoa do Garr\u00e3o, can indicate that the \n\ncolonization of new individuals will not occur in this area in the future. \n\n \n\nLagoa de S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o \nEvery year (2011, 2012, 2013) 5 nasas and 9 fluctuating traps were placed in the lake. \n\nDue to the big size of the lake, it was divided into 3 zones \u2013 north, south and centre. The \ntraps were distributed evenly in each zone to ensure the equilibrium of trapping. \n\n \nFigure A103. Localization of traps in Lagoa de S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o during 2011, 2012, 2013 \n\n \n\nThe number of recaptures (477) is again much higher than the number of captures (180 \n\nindividuals) which indicates this number can be close to reality. 21 juveniles and 38 \n\nneonates, although being a low number, is a positive result which shows nesting of \n\nEmys orbicularis occurs safely in the lake. \n\n \n\nLagoa Quinta do Lago Sul \nIn 2011 5 nasas were placed in the lake, evenly distributed around its perimeter; \n\nDue to maintenance works in the northern part of lake in 2012, only 3 nasas were placed \n\nin the south of the lake; \n\nIn 2013 4 nasas were placed in the south of the lake like it was in 2011, while it was not \n\npossible to locate 1 nasa in the north. \n\n \nFigure A104. A \u2013 localization of traps in Lagoa Quinta do Lago Sul during 2011; B \u2013 \nlocalization of traps in Lagoa Quinta do Lago Sul during 2012; C \u2013 localization of traps \nin Lagoa Quinta do Lago Sul in 2013 \n\n \n\n\n\n114 \n\n \n\nThe number of recaptures in this case (507) was extremely high in comparison to the \n\nnumber of captures (101) which guarantees a little margin of error for the real number \n\nof individuals in the lake. \n\nThe number of captured juveniles (46) is the highest among the 4 project sites although \n\nit is all the same low in comparison to the number of adults. The results show that the \n\npopulation of Emys orbicularis in the lake is theoretically healthy, with mature adult \n\nindividuals capable of reproduction and renewal of population. \n\n \n\nTable A13.
