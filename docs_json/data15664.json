Sistemas arenosos de \u00e1guas profundas formados \n\nentre o Albiano e o Mioceno, durante a fase de margem divergente da bacia, \n\ngenericamente designados como turbiditos, cont\u00e9m a maior parte das reservas de \n\nhidrocarbonetos. Ao contr\u00e1rio da tend\u00eancia de aumento de maturidade petrogr\u00e1fica \n\nesperada para uma margem continental geodinamicamente passiva, os turbiditos da \n\nBacia de Campos apresentam uma recorrente imaturidade composicional e textural dada \n\npor granulometria modal nas fra\u00e7\u00f5es areia m\u00e9dia e grossa e por alta propor\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nfeldspatos. Para o entendimento dos processos que controlaram o suprimento de areia \n\npara os ambientes de \u00e1guas profundas da Bacia de Campos foi utilizada uma \n\nmetodologia integrada baseada na petrografia quantitativa dos turbiditos pelo m\u00e9todo \n\nGazzi-Dickinson de contagem de pontos, na an\u00e1lise estrutural da deforma\u00e7\u00e3o produzida \n\npor tect\u00f4nica de embasamento atrav\u00e9s de atributos s\u00edsmicos, e na restaura\u00e7\u00e3o de se\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nde estruturas distencionais produzidas por tect\u00f4nica sal\u00edfera. \n\n A petrografia quantitativa evidenciou as tend\u00eancias gerais e a organiza\u00e7\u00e3o interna \n\ndos par\u00e2metros petrogr\u00e1ficos dos turbiditos, al\u00e9m de permitir a defini\u00e7\u00e3o de duas classes \n\nde sitemas de acordo com sua maturidade textural e composicional.

A restaura\u00e7\u00e3o de se\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nmostrou que a tect\u00f4nica sal\u00edfera tamb\u00e9m tem sido epis\u00f3dica na Bacia de Campos, com \n\nquatro pulsos de alta taxa de distens\u00e3o correlacion\u00e1veis com os eventos de reativa\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\nembasamento, sugerindo que a tect\u00f4nica sal\u00edfera rasa tem sido controlada pela tect\u00f4nica \n\nde embasamento. \n\nA integra\u00e7\u00e3o entre os dados da petrografia quantitativa e da an\u00e1lise tect\u00f4nica \n\npossibilitou a defini\u00e7\u00e3o dos controles que atuaram durante a deposi\u00e7\u00e3o dos sistemas \n\narenosos de \u00e1guas profundas durante a fase de margem passive da Bacia de Campos. \n\nFicou evidente que esta sedimenta\u00e7\u00e3o foi condicionada pela evolu\u00e7\u00e3o paleogeogr\u00e1fica \n\nda margem continental sudeste do Brasil, com a altern\u00e2ncia de controle eust\u00e1tico e \n\ngeodin\u00e2mico. \n\nO controle eust\u00e1tico, associado com ciclos de alta frequ\u00eancia relacionados \u00e0 \n\ndin\u00e2mica interna da bacia e possivelmente a oscila\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas, ocorreu em per\u00edodos \n\nde calma tect\u00f4nica e recuo de escarpa, com relevo costeiro relativamente rebaixado e \n\nlarga plataforma marinha rasa. Os sistemas de \u00e1guas profundas controlados \n\n\n\n \n\neustaticamente s\u00e3o caracterizados por turbiditos relativamente maturos, depositados no \n\ntrato de sistemas de mar baixo. Por sua vez, o condicionamento geodin\u00e2mico na \n\nsedimenta\u00e7\u00e3o tem predominado durante per\u00edodos de rejuvenescimento fisiogr\u00e1fico \n\nproduzido pela atividade geodin\u00e2mica ao longo da margem continental, caracterizados \n\npor relevo costeiro elevado e destrui\u00e7\u00e3o da plataforma continental. O controle \n\ngeodin\u00e2mico \u00e9 associado com epis\u00f3dios clim\u00e1ticos de precipita\u00e7\u00e3o pluvial intensa e \n\ninunda\u00e7\u00e3o dos sistemas fluviais montanhosos capazes de carregar sedimentos aluviais \n\nimaturos diretamente para os ambientes de \u00e1guas profundas. \n\nEsta nova abordagem sobre os controles da deposi\u00e7\u00e3o dos sistemas arenosos de \n\n\u00e1guas profundas da Bacia de Campos \u00e9 muito importante para a defini\u00e7\u00e3o de modelos \n\nmais adequados para a explora\u00e7\u00e3o de novos reservat\u00f3rios turbid\u00edticos, bem como para o \n\naumento da recupera\u00e7\u00e3o de petr\u00f3leo dos reservat\u00f3rios j\u00e1 descobertos. Em fun\u00e7\u00e3o da sua \n\nsimplicidade, a metodologia proposta nesta tese pode ser facilmente aplicada para o \n\nentendimento dos controles da sedimenta\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1guas profundas em outras bacias de \n\nmargem divergente. \n\n\n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nThe Campos Basin, located along the southeastern continental margin of Brazil, is \n\nthe major oil province in the country. Deepwater sand-rich systems formed from Albian \n\nto Miocene during the divergent margin phase of the basin, generically designated as \n\nturbidites, contain most of the hydrocarbon reserves. Opposite to the trend of increasing \n\npetrographic maturity expected for a tectonically passive continental margin, the \n\nturbidite reservoirs in Campos Basin show recurrent immaturity defined by medium to \n\ncoarse sand grain size and high feldspar content. In order to understand the controls on \n\nthe supply of sandy sediments to Campos Basin deepwater settings an integrated \n\nmethodology was used, based on quantitative petrography through the Gazzi-Dickinson \n\nmethod of point-counting, on structural analysis of basement-related deformation with \n\nseismic attributes, and on section restoration of major extensional salt structures. \n\n The quantitative petrographic analysis indicated the major average trends and the \n\ninternal organization of the petrographic parameters of the turbidites, and defined two \n\nclasses of systems based on their textural and compositional maturity. The structural \n\nanalysis indicated four episodes of strike-slip reactivation of the basement fabric during \n\nthe passive margin phase of Campos Basin. The section restoration showed that salt \n\ntectonics in the Campos Basin was also episodic, with four pulses of high extension rate \n\nthat can be well correlated with the basement reactivation events, suggesting that \n\nbasement tectonics have been controlling salt tectonics. \n\nThe integration between data from quantitative petrography and tectonic analysis \n\nallowed the definition of the controls on the formation of the deepwater sand-rich \n\nsystems during the divergent margin phase in the Campos Basin. It became evident that \n\nthis sedimentation has been constrained by the paleogeographic evolution of the \n\nsoutheastern continental margin of Brazil, with alternating eustatic and geodynamic \n\ncontrol. \n\nThe eustatic control is associated with high-frequency climate cycles related to the \n\ninternal basin dynamics and possibly with climatic oscillations, and occurred during \n\nperiods of tectonic quiescence and escarpment retreat, with relatively low coastal relief \n\nand well developed continental shelf. The eustatically-controlled deepwater systems are \n\ncharacterized by relatively mature turbidites, deposited beyond a wide shelf during sea-\n\nlevel lowstands. In turn, the geodynamic drive on the sedimentation occurred during \n\nperiods of physiographic rejuvenation produced by geodynamic activity along the \n\ncontinental margin, characterized by high coastal relief and degradation of the \n\n\n\n \n\ncontinental shelf. The geodynamic control is associated with episodes of intense rainfall \n\nand flooding of mountainous fluvial systems that transported immature alluvial \n\nsediments directly to the deepwater settings. \n\nThis new approach to the controls on the formation of the sand-rich deepwater \n\nsystems in Campos Basin will be of key importance to generate realistic models for the \n\nexploration of new turbidite reservoirs and for the optimized development of producing \n\nturbidite oilfields in such a world-class hydrocarbon province. As it is very simple, the \n\nproposed integrated methodology can help to unravel the controls on the deposition of \n\ndeepwater sand-rich reservoirs in other divergent margin settings. \n\n\n\n \n\nSobre a Estrutura da Tese \n\nEsta tese de Doutorado est\u00e1 estruturada em torno de artigos publicados em peri\u00f3dicos \n\ninternacionais.

Petrographic and seismic evidence for the depositional setting of giant \n\nturbidite reservoirs and the paleogeographic evolution of Campos Basin, offshore \n\nBrazil. \n\nArtigo submetido \u00e0 revista Earth Science Reviews, no qual s\u00e3o apresentados os \n\nresultados da petrografia quantitativa dos principais sistemas silicicl\u00e1sticos arenosos de \n\n\u00e1guas profundas da Bacia de Campos, e da an\u00e1lise estrutural de padr\u00f5es envolvendo \n\nreativa\u00e7\u00e3o do embasamento. Com base nestes dados s\u00e3o estabelecidos os controles da \n\ndeposi\u00e7\u00e3o destes sistemas, atrav\u00e9s da reconstru\u00e7\u00e3o paleogeogr\u00e1fica do sistema fonte-\n\nbacia durante a fase de margem continental divergente, desde o Albiano at\u00e9 o Mioceno. \n\n\n\n 11\n\nIntrodu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nO objetivo deste projeto de doutorado foi a defini\u00e7\u00e3o dos controles que determinaram \n\na deposi\u00e7\u00e3o dos sistemas arenosos de \u00e1guas profundas formados desde o Albiano at\u00e9 o \n\nMioceno, durante a fase de margem divergente da Bacia de Campos, na costa sudeste do \n\nBrasil (ver Figuras 1 e 2 do Artigo III). Os arenitos de \u00e1guas profundas, designados \n\ngenericamente como turbiditos, em fun\u00e7\u00e3o de seu processo deposicional a partir de \n\ncorrentes de turbidez, apresentam grande relev\u00e2ncia econ\u00f4mica por constitu\u00edrem \n\nexcelentes reservat\u00f3rios de petr\u00f3leo. Os turbiditos da Bacia de Campos, \n\nespecificamente, comportam cerca de 80% das reservas e da produ\u00e7\u00e3o brasileiras de \n\nhidrocarbonetos (Bruhn et al., 2003) e est\u00e3o diretamente relacionados com a \n\nrecentemente atingida auto-sufici\u00eancia de petr\u00f3leo do Brasil. \n\nAs margens continentais divergentes, contexto geol\u00f3gico geral no qual se insere a \n\nBacia de Campos, s\u00e3o ainda encaradas como ambientes tectonicamente passivos, cuja \n\nevolu\u00e7\u00e3o geodin\u00e2mica do tipo recuo de escarpa se restringe a processos de epirog\u00eanese, \n\nsubsid\u00eancia t\u00e9rmica, eros\u00e3o, sedimenta\u00e7\u00e3o e ajustes isost\u00e1ticos (Ollier, 1985; Weissel e \n\nKarner, 1989; Gilchrist e Summerfield, 1990; Beaumont et al., 2000). A deforma\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nobservada nas bacias sedimentares das margens divergentes tem sido em grande parte \n\natribu\u00edda aos processos gravitacionais da tect\u00f4nica sal\u00edfera rasa (Cobbold e Szatmari, \n\n1991). Com estas condi\u00e7\u00f5es de contorno o registro estratigr\u00e1fico destas margens \n\npassivas seria totalmente controlado pelas varia\u00e7\u00f5es eust\u00e1ticas do n\u00edvel do mar, \n\nconforme o paradigma cl\u00e1ssico da Estratigrafia de Seq\u00fc\u00eancias (Vail et al., 1977), que \n\nt\u00eam sido junto \u00e0 Sedimentologia (abordagem ES&amp;S) as disciplinas mais utilizadas no \n\nestudo dos sistemas arenosos de \u00e1guas profundas em todos os tipos de bacias \n\nsedimentares (Mutti et al., 2003; Catuneanu, 2006). Mesmo considerando os \n\nimportantes avan\u00e7os obtidos na compreens\u00e3o dos ambientes sedimentares de \u00e1guas \n\nprofundas da Bacia de Campos com base nestas disciplinas (Azambuja Filho, 1990; \n\nBruhn, 1993; Peres, 1993; Scarton, 1993; Pereira, 1994; Souza Cruz, 1995; Souza Jr., \n\n1997), importantes aspectos das condi\u00e7\u00f5es gen\u00e9ticas desta sedimenta\u00e7\u00e3o ainda n\u00e3o \n\nforam adequadamente esclarecidos. A abordagem convencional da estratigrafia de \n\nseq\u00fc\u00eancias assume que o suprimento de areias para os sistemas de \u00e1guas profundas \n\ndurante a fase de margem divergente da Bacia de Campos tenha sido essencialmente \n\nrelacionado com per\u00edodos de queda acentuada do n\u00edvel do mar, com retrabalhamento \n\nsedimentar na plataforma continental, o que parece n\u00e3o ter ocorrido. Al\u00e9m disso, a \n\nevolu\u00e7\u00e3o de uma margem continental passiva deveria corresponder a um gradual \n\n\n\n 12\n\nrebaixamento do relevo, e a um aumento progressivo da maturidade composicional e \n\ntextural dos turbiditos, o que tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o se verifica, uma vez que expressivos sistemas \n\nturbid\u00edticos arenosos caracterizados por imaturidade composicional e textural foram \n\nrecorrentemente depositados na Bacia de Campos (Scarton, 1993; Bruhn e Walker, \n\n1995; Caddah et al., 1998; Artigos I e III).  \n\nMais recentemente, em trabalhos que seguem uma abordagem geodin\u00e2mica, foi \n\nsugerido que a sedimenta\u00e7\u00e3o nas bacias da margem continental sudeste do Brasil, \n\nincluindo a Bacia de Campos, poderia ter sido controlada por reativa\u00e7\u00f5es tect\u00f4nicas do \n\nembasamento (Pereira, 1994; Lima, 1999; Cobbold et al., 2001; Lima, 2003; Artigos I e \n\nIII), e pela passagem da margem sobre uma pluma do manto durante a transi\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nCret\u00e1ceo-Terci\u00e1rio (Thomaz Filho et al., 2005; Zal\u00e1n e Oliveira, 2005; Artigo III). \n\nParalelamente, o soerguimento da margem continental sudeste do Brasil tamb\u00e9m vem \n\nsendo evidenciado por estudos de tra\u00e7os de fiss\u00e3o em apatitas (Gallagher e Brown, \n\n1999; Saenz et al., 2003). Embora em linhas gerais tanto o rejuvenescimento tect\u00f4nico \n\ndo relevo quanto a atividade magm\u00e1tica e o soerguimento din\u00e2mico causados pela \n\npluma do manto sejam coerentes com a imaturidade dos sistemas arenosos de \u00e1guas \n\nprofundas, n\u00e3o foram apresentadas ainda evid\u00eancias cient\u00edficas sobre o sincronismo do \n\ntectonismo e da atividade da pluma com a forma\u00e7\u00e3o dos v\u00e1rios sistemas turbid\u00edticos da \n\nBacia de Campos.  \n\nNesta perspectiva, o presente projeto de pesquisa foi proposto para analisar as \n\nrela\u00e7\u00f5es entre os principais eventos geodin\u00e2micos e a deposi\u00e7\u00e3o dos sistemas arenosos \n\nde \u00e1guas profundas da Bacia de Campos. Para isso uma abordagem integrando \n\npetrografia sedimentar quantitativa e tect\u00f4nica (PS&amp;T), j\u00e1 utilizada com sucesso em \n\nbacias de margens convergentes e tectonicamente ativas (Valloni e Zuffa, 1984; Fontana \n\net al., 1989; Critelli, 1993; Marchesini et al., 2000; Cibin et al., 2001), foi adaptada para \n\na margem divergente da Bacia de Campos. A metodologia proposta corresponde a uma \n\nabordagem da evolu\u00e7\u00e3o tect\u00f4nica e paleogeogr\u00e1fica da Bacia de Campos atrav\u00e9s da \n\nintegra\u00e7\u00e3o, at\u00e9 agora n\u00e3o explorada na an\u00e1lise de margens divergentes, de tr\u00eas t\u00e9cnicas \n\nindividualmente j\u00e1 bastante difundidas: (1) a petrografia quantitativa dos arenitos \n\nturbid\u00edticos (Artigos I e III); (2) a an\u00e1lise estrutural de dados s\u00edsmicos, com \u00eanfase na \n\ndeforma\u00e7\u00e3o produzida pela tect\u00f4nica de embasamento (Artigos II e III); (3) a \n\nrestaura\u00e7\u00e3o seq\u00fcencial de se\u00e7\u00f5es geol\u00f3gicas (Artigo II). Com esta nova abordagem foi \n\nposs\u00edvel estabelecer um conjunto robusto de evid\u00eancias que indicam uma altern\u00e2ncia de \n\ncontroles distintos para o registro estratigr\u00e1fico de \u00e1guas profundas da Bacia de \n\n\n\n 13\n\nCampos. Estes controles s\u00e3o estabelecidos pela evolu\u00e7\u00e3o do peso relativo dos processos \n\ngeodin\u00e2micos, eust\u00e1ticos e clim\u00e1ticos, c\u00edclicos ou epis\u00f3dicos, durante a fase de margem \n\ndivergente da bacia, desde o Albiano at\u00e9 o Mioceno (Artigo III). \n\n\n\n 14\n\nMetodologia \n\nBioestratigrafia \n\nA primeira demanda metodol\u00f3gica deste projeto foi a defini\u00e7\u00e3o de um arcabou\u00e7o \n\ncronogeol\u00f3gico padr\u00e3o para todas as an\u00e1lises, uma vez que o tema central da pesquisa \n\nenvolve a investiga\u00e7\u00e3o da hip\u00f3tese de sincronismo do processo de sedimenta\u00e7\u00e3o em \n\n\u00e1guas profundas com os processos geodin\u00e2micos e eust\u00e1ticos na Bacia de Campos. Este \n\narcabou\u00e7o se faz necess\u00e1rio n\u00e3o apenas para garantir a uniformidade das correla\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nentre eventos, mas tamb\u00e9m para verificar se a resolu\u00e7\u00e3o temporal est\u00e1 adequada para as \n\ncorrela\u00e7\u00f5es estabelecidas. \n\nTodas as data\u00e7\u00f5es citadas no presente trabalho est\u00e3o baseadas no zoneamento de \n\nnanof\u00f3sseis calc\u00e1rios estabelecido para as bacias da margem continental do Brasil por \n\nAntunes et al. (2004), com equival\u00eancia cronom\u00e9trica absoluta baseada na Carta \n\nEstratigr\u00e1fica Internacional da Comiss\u00e3o Internacional em Estratigrafia \u2013 ICS \n\n(http://www.stratigraphy.org/cheu.pdf; Gradstein et al., 2004). Para a fase de margem \n\ndivergente da Bacia de Campos, o referido zoneamento bioestratigr\u00e1fico corresponde a \n\n18 biozonas no Per\u00edodo Cret\u00e1ceo, entre as Idades Albiano e Maastrichtiano, com uma \n\nresolu\u00e7\u00e3o em torno de 2,6 Ma, e a 35 biozonas na Era Cenoz\u00f3ica, entre os Per\u00edodos \n\nPaleogeno e Quatern\u00e1rio, o que equivale a uma resolu\u00e7\u00e3o aproximada de 1,8 Ma. Cabe \n\nressaltar que o n\u00edvel de resolu\u00e7\u00e3o temporal do arcabou\u00e7o cronogeol\u00f3gico adotado \n\nmostrou-se adequado tanto para a data\u00e7\u00e3o da forma\u00e7\u00e3o dos sistemas turbid\u00edticos \n\narenosos analisados na petrografia quantitativa (Artigos I e III), quanto para a \n\ninterpreta\u00e7\u00e3o dos eventos tect\u00f4nicos indicados pela an\u00e1lise estrutural (Artigos II e III). \n\nPetrografia Quantitativa \n\nA contagem de pontos em l\u00e2minas delgadas foi a t\u00e9cnica utilizada no presente \n\nprojeto para a an\u00e1lise petrogr\u00e1fica quantitativa dos arenitos de \u00e1guas profundas da Bacia \n\nde Campos. A contagem foi feita atrav\u00e9s do m\u00e9todo Gazzi-Dickinson (Gazzi, 1966; \n\nDickinson, 1970; Ingersoll et al., 1984), conforme adapta\u00e7\u00f5es sugeridas por Zuffa \n\n(Zuffa, 1980; Zuffa, 1985; Zuffa, 1991). Esta metodologia foi escolhida pela sua \n\npraticidade e robustez de resultados j\u00e1 amplamente comprovados (Dickinson e Suczec, \n\n1979; Dickinson et al., 1983; Dickinson, 1985; Zuffa, 1987; Dickinson, 1988; Zuffa et \n\nal., 1995; Zuffa et al., 2000). \n\nA petrografia quantitativa foi aplicada a onze sistemas turbid\u00edticos da fase de \n\nmargem divergente da Bacia de Campos, com idades entre o Albiano e o Mioceno (ver \n\n\n\n 15\n\nFigura 4 do Artigo III). Foram contados 300 pontos por l\u00e2mina em 117 l\u00e2minas \n\ndelgadas correspondentes a 990 m de testemunhos dos sistemas turbid\u00edticos estudados \n\n(ver Tabela 1 do Artigo III).  \n\nOs par\u00e2metros petrogr\u00e1ficos composicionais e texturais e os resultados brutos da \n\ncontagem de pontos est\u00e3o registrados nas planilhas em anexo (ver CD em anexo). \n\nTamb\u00e9m est\u00e3o discriminadas nas planilhas as totaliza\u00e7\u00f5es composicionais para os \n\nprincipais diagramas tern\u00e1rios convencionalmente utilizados neste tipo de an\u00e1lise \n\npetrogr\u00e1fica (Figuras 5, 6 e 7 do Artigo III). Mesmo n\u00e3o sendo adequadas para an\u00e1lise \n\nquantitativa, foram descritas qualitativamente 4 l\u00e2minas delgadas de conglomerados do \n\nsistema turbid\u00edtico do Eoceno M\u00e9dio (ver CD em anexo), por apresentarem um \n\nsignificado paleogeogr\u00e1fico importante (Artigo III). \n\nAn\u00e1lise Estrutural de Dados S\u00edsmicos \n\nA utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o do m\u00e9todo s\u00edsmico na an\u00e1lise de bacias sedimentares tem experimentado \n\num grande crescimento nas \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas em fun\u00e7\u00e3o dos progressos tecnol\u00f3gicos e da \n\nredu\u00e7\u00e3o dos custos de aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o e processamento dos dados s\u00edsmicos. Atualmente a \n\nmaior parte das grandes prov\u00edncias de hidrocarbonetos do mundo, como a Bacia de \n\nCampos, est\u00e1 coberta com s\u00edsmica 3D de boa qualidade, de modo que os dados s\u00edsmicos \n\nj\u00e1 s\u00e3o apontados como um novo marco tecnol\u00f3gico na evolu\u00e7\u00e3o das Ci\u00eancias da Terra \n\n(Cartwright e Huuse, 2005). Este potencial t\u00eam se evidenciado bastante nas \u00e1reas de \n\nGeologia Estrutural e Tect\u00f4nica, uma vez que a visualiza\u00e7\u00e3o tridimensional e detalhada \n\ndas fei\u00e7\u00f5es estruturais em volumes s\u00edsmicos possibilita um entendimento dos sistemas \n\nesfor\u00e7o-deforma\u00e7\u00e3o muitas vezes at\u00e9 melhor do que o que pode ser obtido pelos \n\nm\u00e9todos tradicionais de an\u00e1lise estrutural atrav\u00e9s de estudo de afloramentos, \n\nmapeamento de superf\u00edcie e sensoreamento remoto. No caso das bacias submersas nas \n\nmargens continentais, o m\u00e9todo s\u00edsmico constitui a \u00fanica ferramenta dispon\u00edvel para o \n\ndesenvolvimento de an\u00e1lises estruturais de detalhe. \n\nMais recentemente esta vantagem tecnol\u00f3gica tem sido ampliada pelo estudo de \n\natributos s\u00edsmicos voltados especificamente para a interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o estrutural. Trata-se dos \n\nchamados atributos s\u00edsmicos geom\u00e9tricos entre os quais se destacam a coer\u00eancia, \n\ninverso da vari\u00e2ncia (Bahorich e Farmer, 1995), e os atributos obtidos pela aplica\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\ngeometria diferencial aos volumes s\u00edsmicos, tais como o gradiente e a curvatura, \n\nrespectivamente a primeira e a segunda derivadas da estrutura em um referencial \n\ntridimensional cartesiano (Chopra e Marfurt, 2006 e 2007). \n\n\n\n 16\n\nA an\u00e1lise estrutural de dados s\u00edsmicos segue o mesmo fluxo de trabalho da an\u00e1lise \n\nestrutural convencional, com a classifica\u00e7\u00e3o espacial e temporal da deforma\u00e7\u00e3o quanto \n\nao estilo estrutural, ao padr\u00e3o cinem\u00e1tico e ao condicionamento din\u00e2mico das estruturas \n\n(Davis e Reynolds, 1996). Neste trabalho foi desenvolvida uma an\u00e1lise estrutural de \n\nquatro volumes s\u00edsmicos regionais da Bacia de Campos. Foram identificadas nestes \n\nvolumes seis \u00e1reas correspondentes aos principais sistemas esfor\u00e7o-deforma\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nproduzidos pela tect\u00f4nica de embasamento. Nestas \u00e1reas a an\u00e1lise estrutural de detalhe \n\nfoi sustentada pela consist\u00eancia espacial de atributos s\u00edsmicos geom\u00e9tricos (Artigos II e \n\nIII). Todos os volumes s\u00edsmicos utilizados, originalmente adquiridos com a coordenada \n\nvertical em tempo de tr\u00e2nsito, foram convertidos para profundidade com um \u00fanico \n\nmodelo regional de velocidades s\u00edsmicas calibradas com um conjunto de tabelas tempo-\n\nprofundidade medidas em po\u00e7os. Adicionalmente todos os horizontes s\u00edsmicos que \n\nfundamentaram o estudo da deforma\u00e7\u00e3o foram ajustados a marcadores \n\nbioestratigr\u00e1ficos.  \n\nAtrav\u00e9s da an\u00e1lise estrutural foi poss\u00edvel caracterizar os principais eventos de \n\ndeforma\u00e7\u00e3o relacionados com a tect\u00f4nica de embasamento durante a fase de margem \n\ncontinental divergente da Bacia de Campos (Artigos II e III). Previamente todos os \n\ntrabalhos de an\u00e1lise estrutural da fase de margem divergente da bacia haviam sido \n\nvoltados para o estudo da deforma\u00e7\u00e3o associada \u00e0 tect\u00f4nica sal\u00edfera (Cobbold e \n\nSzatmari, 1991; Demercian et al., 1993). Neste sentido os resultados do presente projeto \n\nconstituem uma contribui\u00e7\u00e3o in\u00e9dita sobre a Geologia Estrutural e a Tect\u00f4nica da Bacia \n\nde Campos. \n\nRestaura\u00e7\u00e3o de Se\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nA t\u00e9cnica de restaura\u00e7\u00e3o ou balanceamento de se\u00e7\u00f5es geol\u00f3gicas vem sendo utilizada \n\npelo menos desde o in\u00edcio do s\u00e9culo passado nos estudos de Geologia Estrutural \n\n(Chamberlin, 1910). O princ\u00edpio b\u00e1sico do m\u00e9todo \u00e9 a restaura\u00e7\u00e3o de todas as unidades \n\ngeol\u00f3gicas de uma se\u00e7\u00e3o deformada \u00e0 sua geometria original, com preserva\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\ncomprimentos, \u00e1reas e volumes, de acordo com a hip\u00f3tese de um estado plano de \n\ndeforma\u00e7\u00e3o. Deste modo, se a restaura\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o for poss\u00edvel, a estrutura expressa na \n\nse\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o \u00e9 vi\u00e1vel, ou porque a interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o est\u00e1 correta, ou porque houve \n\ndeforma\u00e7\u00e3o significativa fora do plano da se\u00e7\u00e3o (Dahlstrom, 1969). \n\nDurante muito tempo a restaura\u00e7\u00e3o foi utilizada apenas para o estudo da deforma\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ncompressiva em faixas de cavalgamento, em se\u00e7\u00f5es definidas atrav\u00e9s de mapeamento de \n\nsuperf\u00edcie (Chamberlin, 1910; Dahlstrom, 1969; Hossack, 1979). Com o uso crescente \n\n\n\n 17\n\ndo m\u00e9todo s\u00edsmico, particularmente nas bacias de margem divergente, a restaura\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nse\u00e7\u00f5es passou a ser usada tamb\u00e9m para o estudo da tect\u00f4nica distensional de \n\nembasamento e da tect\u00f4nica sal\u00edfera (Gibbs, 1983; Schultz-Ela, 1991; Rowan, 1993).  \n\nUma importante caracter\u00edstica do balanceamento de se\u00e7\u00f5es \u00e9 o fato de que se a \n\nrestaura\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 poss\u00edvel, al\u00e9m da defini\u00e7\u00e3o de interpreta\u00e7\u00f5es estruturais vi\u00e1veis, tamb\u00e9m \n\npodem ser feitas infer\u00eancias e estimativas sobre o processo de deforma\u00e7\u00e3o (Chamberlin, \n\n1910; Dahlstrom, 1969; Hossack, 1979; Gibbs, 1983; Nunns, 1991; Schultz-Ela, 1992). \n\nParticularmente, se as unidades restauradas estiverem ajustadas a um arcabou\u00e7o \n\ngeocronol\u00f3gico, podem ser computadas, al\u00e9m das medidas absolutas, as taxas temporais \n\nde deforma\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nNo presente projeto foram restauradas cinco se\u00e7\u00f5es extra\u00eddas de volumes s\u00edsmicos no \n\ndom\u00ednio proximal-distensional da \u00e1rea deformada por tect\u00f4nica sal\u00edfera na Bacia de \n\nCampos (Artigo II). Todas as se\u00e7\u00f5es foram convertidas de tempo para profundidade \n\ncom o mesmo modelo regional de velocidades citado anteriormente e s\u00e3o transversais a \n\nfalhas normais l\u00edstricas de grande rejeito, que representam adequadamente o processo de \n\ntect\u00f4nica sal\u00edfera distencional que tem atuado durante a fase de margem divergente da \n\nBacia de Campos. O objetivo deste trabalho foi estudar as taxas de deforma\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nassociadas ao processo de deslizamento gravitacional sobre o descolamento definido \n\npelo sal Aptiano, para verificar o poss\u00edvel sincronismo entre a tect\u00f4nica sal\u00edfera e as \n\nreativa\u00e7\u00f5es de embasamento (Artigo II). \n\nA restaura\u00e7\u00e3o de se\u00e7\u00f5es foi realizada com o aplicativo RECON desenvolvido pelo \n\nGrupo TecGraf da PUC-RJ (http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br) em conv\u00eanio com a \n\nPetrobras. Foi adotado o procedimento padr\u00e3o para restaura\u00e7\u00e3o seq\u00fcencial de se\u00e7\u00f5es em \n\nzonas de tect\u00f4nica sal\u00edfera distencional, com ajuste isost\u00e1tico e descompacta\u00e7\u00e3o \n\n(Schultz-Ela, 1991 e 1992; Rowan, 1993). Em todas as se\u00e7\u00f5es os falhamentos normais \n\nforam restaurados atrav\u00e9s do algoritmo de movimento sobre falha, com cisalhamento \n\nantit\u00e9tico no bloco baixo. Foi assumido o descolamento totalmente desacoplado no sal \n\nAptiano, de modo que as sucess\u00f5es pr\u00e9-Aptianas da fase distencional n\u00e3o foram \n\nrestauradas. Esta hip\u00f3tese foi assumida para garantir o valor l\u00f3gico de uma eventual \n\ncorrela\u00e7\u00e3o entre pulsos de tect\u00f4nica sal\u00edfera e reativa\u00e7\u00f5es de embasamento (Artigo II). \n\nForam restaurados em cada se\u00e7\u00e3o nove horizontes da fase de margem divergente da \n\nBacia de Campos, ajustados a marcadores bioestratigr\u00e1ficos com idades entre o Albiano \n\ne o Recente (Fundo do Mar). Os resultados geometricamente compat\u00edveis em todas as \n\netapas da restaura\u00e7\u00e3o das cinco se\u00e7\u00f5es indicaram que, em linhas gerais, a hip\u00f3tese de \n\n\n\n 18\n\ndescolamento constitui uma aproxima\u00e7\u00e3o razo\u00e1vel para o processo de deforma\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\ndom\u00ednio distencional da tect\u00f4nica sal\u00edfera na Bacia de Campos (Artigo II). \n\n\n\n 19\n\nResultados Obtidos \n\nA petrografia quantitativa pelo m\u00e9todo Gazzi-Dickinson evidenciou a exist\u00eancia de \n\nduas classes de turbiditos durante a fase de margem divergente da Bacia de Campos, em \n\nfun\u00e7\u00e3o da maturidade petrogr\u00e1fica. Estas duas classes ficaram bem discriminadas no \n\ngr\u00e1fico dos par\u00e2metros m\u00e9dios tamanho de gr\u00e3o versus raz\u00e3o quartzo-feldspato \u2013 Q/F \n\n(Figura 1). Os turbiditos relativamente maturos apresentam granulometria areia fina e \n\nigual propor\u00e7\u00e3o de quartzo e feldspato (Q/F = 1). Os turbiditos imaturos s\u00e3o definidos \n\npela granulometria areia m\u00e9dia e pela maior propor\u00e7\u00e3o de feldspatos do que de quartzo \n\n(Q/F = 0.75).  \n\nEstas duas classes de turbiditos s\u00e3o caracterizadas tamb\u00e9m por padr\u00f5es distintos de \n\nvaria\u00e7\u00e3o interna dos principais par\u00e2metros petrogr\u00e1ficos. Nos sistemas turbid\u00edticos \n\nrelativamente maturos os par\u00e2metros petrogr\u00e1ficos apresentam ou uma organiza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ninterna c\u00edclica (Figuras 9 e 20 do Artigo III), ou uma tend\u00eancia bem definida (Figura 22 \n\ndo Artigo III). Por sua vez os sistemas imaturos, caracterizados por uma aus\u00eancia de \n\norganiza\u00e7\u00e3o interna dos par\u00e2metros petrogr\u00e1ficos, mostram uma correla\u00e7\u00e3o direta entre \n\na propor\u00e7\u00e3o de quartzo (Q/F) e o tamanho de gr\u00e3o (Figura 12 do Artigo III). \n\nOutro resultado importante da petrografia quantitativa foi a defini\u00e7\u00e3o das principais \n\ntend\u00eancias dos par\u00e2metros petrogr\u00e1ficos m\u00e9dios dos sistemas turbid\u00edticos da fase de \n\nmargem divergente da Bacia de Campos: (1) a progressiva redu\u00e7\u00e3o no conte\u00fado de \n\nmicas foi interpretada como resultado do final da exuma\u00e7\u00e3o da Faixa Orog\u00eanica \n\nRibeira, do Proteroz\u00f3ico Superior, que aflora na margem da Bacia de Campos (Figura \n\n30 do Artigo III); (2) o aumento significativo da contribui\u00e7\u00e3o de fragmentos vulc\u00e2nicos \n\nna transi\u00e7\u00e3o Cret\u00e1ceo-Pale\u00f3geno foi interpretada como efeito da passagem da margem \n\ncontinental sobre a pluma do manto de Trindade (Figuras 26 e 39 do Artigo III); (3) a \n\nredu\u00e7\u00e3o da propor\u00e7\u00e3o de quartzo (Q/F), e o aumento da granulometria foram \n\ninterpretados como conseq\u00fc\u00eancias do rejuvenescimento do relevo nas margens da bacia, \n\nassociado com reativa\u00e7\u00f5es tect\u00f4nicas de embasamento e com o soerguimento din\u00e2mico \n\ncausado pela pluma do manto; (4) o aumento da contribui\u00e7\u00e3o de intraclastos foi \n\ninterpretado como efeito conjunto do aumento da energia das correntes de fundo e de \n\nreconfigura\u00e7\u00f5es da fisiografia do talude continental; (5) o aumento da contribui\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nglauconita implica na exist\u00eancia de uma plataforma continental bem desenvolvida e \n\nadicionalmente em mudan\u00e7as nas trajet\u00f3rias das correntes de fundo atrav\u00e9s desta \n\nplataforma; (6) a contribui\u00e7\u00e3o de carbonato intrabacial (CI) tamb\u00e9m est\u00e1 diretamente \n\nrelacionada com a exist\u00eancia de uma plataforma rasa na bacia, neste sentido a \n\n\n\n 20\n\nsignificativa redu\u00e7\u00e3o do par\u00e2metro CI durante o Cret\u00e1ceo Superior evidencia muito bem \n\na destrui\u00e7\u00e3o da plataforma Albiana na Bacia de Campos (Figura 27 do Artigo III). \n\n \nFigura 1 \u2013 Classifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos turbiditos da fase de margem divergente da Bacia de Campos segundo \nos par\u00e2metros petrogr\u00e1ficos m\u00e9dios de maturidade composicional (Q/F \u2013 raz\u00e3o quartzo-feldspato) \ne textural (tamanho de gr\u00e3o).  \n\nA an\u00e1lise estrutural de dados s\u00edsmicos permitiu a defini\u00e7\u00e3o de quatro fases principais \n\nde reativa\u00e7\u00e3o tect\u00f4nica do embasamento durante o est\u00e1gio de margem divergente da \n\nBacia de Campos: duas fases no Cret\u00e1ceo, uma no Paleogeno e uma no Neogeno \n\n(Tabela 1 do Artigo II e Tabela 3 do Artigo III). A deforma\u00e7\u00e3o tem estilo estrutural e \n\npadr\u00e3o cinem\u00e1tico transcorrentes e est\u00e1 concentrada junto aos altos estruturais do \n\nembasamento, configurando um contexto geodin\u00e2mico de tect\u00f4nica de blocos, com \n\nreativa\u00e7\u00e3o seletiva de estruturas, t\u00edpicos do ambiente intraplaca (Ziegler et al., 1995; \n\nSibson, 1995; Storti et al., 2003). Cabe ressaltar que os principais altos internos do \n\nembasamento da Bacia de Campos controlam, al\u00e9m da deforma\u00e7\u00e3o transcorrente \n\nlocalizada, fei\u00e7\u00f5es regionais expressivas, tais como os dom\u00ednios da tect\u00f4nica sal\u00edfera e a \n\nfrente de prograda\u00e7\u00e3o do Neogeno (Artigo II). \n\n\n\n 21\n\nAtrav\u00e9s da restaura\u00e7\u00e3o de se\u00e7\u00f5es foi poss\u00edvel definir a natureza epis\u00f3dica da \n\ntect\u00f4nica sal\u00edfera distencional durante a fase de margem divergente da Bacia de Campos \n\n(Figuras 14 e 15 do Artigo II). Adicionalmente observou-se uma boa correla\u00e7\u00e3o entre os \n\npulsos da tect\u00f4nica sal\u00edfera computados com base na restaura\u00e7\u00e3o de se\u00e7\u00f5es e os eventos \n\nde reativa\u00e7\u00e3o do embasamento definidos com base na an\u00e1lise estrutural de atributos \n\ns\u00edsmicos (Artigo II). Esta correla\u00e7\u00e3o sugere que, na Bacia de Campos, a tect\u00f4nica \n\nsal\u00edfera tem sido controlada pela tect\u00f4nica de embasamento. \n\nA integra\u00e7\u00e3o dos resultados obtidos permitiu o estabelecimento de uma associa\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nentre a evolu\u00e7\u00e3o geodin\u00e2mica, as tend\u00eancias dos par\u00e2metros petrogr\u00e1ficos m\u00e9dios e as \n\nduas classes de maturidade dos turbiditos da Bacia de Campos (Figura 2). A evolu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nda fase de margem passiva da bacia corresponde a uma intera\u00e7\u00e3o de tr\u00eas processos \n\ngeodin\u00e2micos (Artigo III): (1) recuo de escarpa em regime tectonicamente passivo; (2) \n\nreativa\u00e7\u00f5es tect\u00f4nicas de embasamento; (3) soerguimento din\u00e2mico e magmatismo \n\nrelacionados com pluma de Trindade.  \n\nDurante os per\u00edodos de recuo de escarpa, no Albiano-Cenomaniano e posteriormente \n\na partir do Oligoceno, foram depositados sistemas turbid\u00edticos relativamente maturos \n\n(Figuras 1 e 2). Estes sistemas s\u00e3o caracterizados por propor\u00e7\u00e3o mais alta de quartzo \n\n(Q/F) e granulometria mais fina (Artigo III). O sistema Cenomaniano tem uma \n\nexpressiva contribui\u00e7\u00e3o de intraclastos e \u00e9 mais imaturo que o sistema Albiano, j\u00e1 \n\nevidenciando algum controle tect\u00f4nico na sedimenta\u00e7\u00e3o. O sistema do Mioceno \n\napresenta uma baixa propor\u00e7\u00e3o de quartzo (Q/F) e uma contribui\u00e7\u00e3o significativa de \n\nglauconita em fun\u00e7\u00e3o do rejuvescimento fisiogr\u00e1fico da costa e da plataforma causado \n\npelo evento tect\u00f4nico do Neogeno.  \n\nPor outro lado, durante as fases de reativa\u00e7\u00e3o tect\u00f4nica e de soerguimento din\u00e2mico, \n\ndo Santoniano at\u00e9 o Eoceno, foram depositados sistemas arenosos imaturos nas \u00e1guas \n\nprofundas da Bacia de Campos (Figuras 1 e 2).

Conversely to \nwhat would be expected for the evolution of a passive divergent margin under transgression, the \nsandstones became more feldspathic and coarser-grained from the Albian-Cenomanian to the Santonian \nand the Campanian-Maastrichtian. Simultaneously tectonic reactivation of the basement fabric generated \nstrike-slip systems bordering structural highs associated with steep rift phase fault zones, causing en-\nechelon folding of Albian to Turonian successions. Additionally, it was observed a significant increase in \nthe contribution of volcanic rock fragments in the uppermost Cretaceous because of the magmatic activity \nassociated with the passage of the Campos Basin border above the Trindade mantle plume. The \nabundance and distribution of such sandy turbidites and the structural features indicate that the evolution \nof Campos Basin deviated substantially from a typical passive margin, being affected by intense and \nincreasing tectonism, magmatism and uplift along the coastal chain source terrains during the Late \nCretaceous. The deposition of geodymamically-controlled, thick, sand-rich turbidites during a major \ntransgression indicates that, even at passive margins, the classic eustatic lowstand model of deepwater fan \ndeposition is too simplistic and restrictive to be used for the exploration for turbidite reservoirs in frontier \ndeepwater areas. An integrated approach is proposed for the understanding of sand-rich deepwater \nsystems in divergent margins, based on quantitative petrography, and on the analysis of the geodynamic \nevolution. \n\n \nKeywords: Deepwater sediment supply, paleogeographic interpretation, passive margin geodynamics, \nsand-rich turbidites, basement uplift \n \n\nIntroduction \n\nThe association of deepwater fans with eustatic sea level lowstands is a classic \n\nparadigm of sequence stratigraphy (Shanmugan and Moiola, 1982). Nevertheless, some \n\ndeepwater systems are in disagreement with this model (Piper and Normark, 1983; \n\nKolla and Perlmutter, 1993; Mutti et al., 1996; Normark et al., 2006). Most of the \n\nobjections to the classic eustatic lowstand model for deepwater fans were based on data \n\nfrom active margin systems. For passive margin basins, the association between eustatic \n\nsea level lowstands and deepwater fans remains accepted as a general rule (Shanmugan \n\net al., 1985; Milliman and Syvitski, 1992; Covault et al., 2007). The development of \n\ndeepwater fans is fundamentally related to sediment supply itself, which can be \n\ncontrolled by eustatic sea level, but also by the geodynamic evolution of source-terrains \n\nand basins, by coastal and shelf physiography, by deltaic progradation rates, and by \n\n\n\n 31\n\nclimatic cycles (Ricci-Luchi, 1985; Mutti, 1985; Weltje and De Boer, 1993; Burges and \n\nHovius, 1998; Piper and Normark, 2001).  \n\nMore recently, the critical role of sediment supply in the development of thick, sand-\n\nrich deepwater fans in both ancient and recent active margins has been discussed on the \n\nbasis of high-resolution stratigraphy (Carvajal and Steel, 2006), and piston cores and \n\nhigh-resolution seismic data (Covault et al., 2007). In the present work we develop \n\nfurther that discussion, taking it both to a wider, geodynamic scale, and to a detailed, \n\npetrographic view. It is interesting to observe that we reach similar conclusions to that \n\nof Carvajal and Steel (2006) and Covault et al. (2007) in a very different geologic \n\nsetting, as we have studied turbidite petrography, structural geology, tectonics and \n\nmagmatism in a South Atlantic divergent margin basin, during the Upper Cretaceous \n\nsecond-order eustatic sea-level highstand (Haq et al., 1987).  \n\nGeological Setting \n\nThick, sand-rich turbidite systems were deposited from the Late Albian to the \n\nMaastrichtian in the Campos Basin (Fig. 1), the most prolific oil province in Brazil, \n\nwhich was originated during the Early-Cretaceous break-up of the Gondwana and \n\nopening of South Atlantic Ocean. The basin follows the classic rift-drift model for \n\npassive margin basins (Falvey, 1974; Le Pichon and Sibuet, 1981). The Early-\n\nCretaceous was characterized by intense magmatic activity, contemporaneous with the \n\nmassive extrusion of tholeiithic lavas in the Paran\u00e1 Basin (Mizusaki et al., 1992). \n\nTaphrogenic successions thicker than 3.5 km were deposited on a basal volcanogenic \n\nsequence from the Valaginian to the Barremian (Fig. 1). During the Aptian, a \n\ntransitional siliciclastic and evaporitic succession was deposited over the breakup \n\nunconformity, at thermal subsidence conditions. The divergent margin stage began \n\nduring Albian, and is still going on (Chang et al., 1992). Thermal subsidence and \n\nsediment loading allowed the deposition of an up to 7 km thick transgressive-regressive \n\nmarine succession. The basin is presently bordered by an up to 2 km high coastal ridge \n\n(Fig. 1). \n\nDuring the Late Cretaceous, in agreement with eustatic sea level curves (e.g. Haq et \n\nal., 1987), a second-order transgressive succession was deposited in the Campos Basin, \n\nfollowing the drowning of a shallow carbonate ramp formed during the Albian (Fig. 1). \n\nUpper Cretaceous continental and shallow marine deposits are poorly-preserved in \n\nCampos Basin. However, thick (up to 300 m) sand-rich systems were deposited \n\n\n\n 32\n\nthroughout the transgression, particularly during the Late Albian (Bruhn et al., 1998), \n\nthe Late Cenomanian (Souza Jr., 1997), the Santonian (Bruhn and Walker, 1995), and \n\nthe Campanian-Maastrichtian (Santos et al., 1999). \n\nTurbidite petrography \n\nPetrographic analysis was performed on 61 thin sections sampled along 456 m of \n\ncores from 5 wells, selected in order to represent the above cited turbidite systems: \n\nUpper Albian (17 samples), Upper Cenomanian (14 samples), Santonian (10 samples), \n\nand Campanian-Maastrichtian (20 samples). Three hundred points were counted per \n\nthin section, using the Gazzi-Dickinson point-counting method (Ingersoll et al., 1984; \n\nZuffa, 1987; 1991). \n\nAll samples are of feldspathic sandstones, and most plot into the Basement Uplift \n\nfield of the Dickinson QtFL diagram (Dickinson, 1985; Fig. 2). Campanian-\n\nMaastrichtian and Santonian samples are very immature, displaying poorer sorting, \n\nhigher feldspar content, and coarser grain size than Cenomanian and Albian samples \n\n(Fig. 2). Such increase in compositional immaturity is expressed in the Dickinson QtFL \n\nplot by an Albian to Maastrichtian trend towards the feldspar pole (Fig. 2, dashed \n\narrow). \n\nSome Campanian-Maastrichtian samples show also a departure towards a litho-\n\nfeldspathic trend (Fig. 2, dotted arrow) caused by an increase in the contribution of \n\nvolcanic rock fragments (Fig. 3b). Cenomanian and Albian samples show significant \n\ncontribution of intrabasinal carbonate grains from the contemporaneous shallow \n\ncarbonate ramp (Figs. 3f, 3h). \n\nThe variation in the maturity of the analyzed sandstones is further indicated by \n\nplotting the ratio of detrital quartz to feldspar content (Q/F) against the modal grain size \n\n(Fig. 4).  It is clearly perceived that Albian and Cenomanian turbidite systems were \n\nsupplied by finer-grained and more quartzose sands than Santonian and Campanian-\n\nMaastrichtian systems (Fig. 4). This trend is opposite to that expected for a passive \n\nmargin under transgression. \n\nStructural evolution, tectonics, and magmatism \n\nThe detached structural style in the Campos Basin is characterized by basement \n\nhorsts and grabbens limited by steep normal faults active during the extensional rift \n\nphase in the Early Cretaceous (Fig. 2; Chang et al., 1992), and by thin-skinned salt \n\ntectonics with extensional-proximal and compressional-distal domains active during \n\n\n\n 33\n\ndivergent margin phase since the Early Albian (Fig. 2; Cobbold and Szatmari, 1991). \n\nHowever it is possible to observe departures from this general style, caused by episodic \n\nreactivation of the basement fabric that occurred during the divergent margin phase \n\n(Cobbold et al., 2001; Fetter et al., 2002). The tectonic reactivation in the Campos Basin \n\nduring the Late Cretaceous is represented by strike-slip fault systems that caused en-\n\nechelon folding of Albian to Turonian successions (Fig. 5). The deformation had been \n\nconcentrated at basement highs associated with steep shear zone systems previously \n\nactivated during the rift phase. The folds are symmetric with 1 km wavelength, 100 m \n\namplitude, and up to 6 km long sinuous fold axes (Fig. 5). \n\nDuring the Late Cretaceous Campos Basin was the site of alkaline magmatism with \n\ncompositional affinity to ocean-island basalts (OIB), associated to its dislocation above \n\nthe Trindade mantle plume (Misuzaki et al., 1992; Almeida et al., 1996; Thompson et \n\nal., 1998; Thomaz Filho et al., 2005).  This coincides with the occurrence of volcanic \n\nash layers intercalated with Santonian turbidites (Caddah et al., 1998), and with the \n\nsignificant contribution of volcanic rock fragments in the Campanian-Maastrichtian \n\nturbidites (Figs. 2 and 3).  \n\nGeodynamic and paleogeographic interpretation of the deepwater sand supply  \n\nThe evolution of divergent margins is currently described by a few geodynamic \n\nprocesses: (i) continuous escarpment retreat of rift shoulders with flexural isostatic \n\nadjust to the unloading caused by denudation (Ollier, 1985; Gilchrist and Summerfield, \n\n1990; Kooi and Beaumont, 1994), (ii) episodic intraplate tectonic reactivations related \n\nto plate border orogenies (Ziegler et al., 1995; Lima, 2003), and (iii) magmatic \n\nunderplating related to episodic mantle plume activity (Brodie and White, 1995); (iv) \n\nreactivation of secondary (edge-driven) convection cells in the upper mantle (Praeg et \n\nal., 2005). \n\nAs previously discussed, there is compelling evidence of Late Cretaceous basement \n\ntectonic reactivation and magmatic activity in the Campos Basin. Besides, the \n\ncompositional and textural immaturity of deepwater sandstones indicates that the \n\ngeodynamic and paleogeographic evolution of the basin border cannot be explained by a \n\ncontinuous escarpment retreat during the Late Cretaceous, which would be better \n\nexpressed by a petrographic trend of increasing maturity. The role of tectonism and \n\nmagmatism as major controls on the evolution of the Campos Basin physiography \n\nduring the Late Cretaceous was previously suggested (Pereira, 1994; Bruhn and Walker, \n\n\n\n 34\n\n1995; Caddah et al., 1998). Nevertheless, the aspect that the deposition of the giant \n\nturbidite reservoirs cannot be related to the classic eustatic lowstand model for \n\ndeepwater fans remains poorly explored and explained. \n\nThe increase in quartz to feldspar ratio and grain size of the turbidites from the \n\nAlbian to the Maastrichtian agrees with the seismic evidence of Upper Cretaceous \n\ntectonic reactivation represented by strike-slip fault systems and by en-echelon folding. \n\nThe petrographic and seismic evidence are also in agreement with the fission-track \n\nindication of uplift of the coastal source terrains (Lima, 2003), and with the distribution \n\nof magmatism in the basin, associated to its dislocation above the Trindade mantle \n\nplume (Thompson et al., 1998; Thomaz Filho et al., 2005).  The whole set of evidence \n\nindicates that: (a) Campos Basin and adjacent sectors of the southeastern Brazilian \n\nmargin behaved as a tectonically active, rather than as a passive margin during the Late \n\nCretaceous; (b) the deposition of large turbidite reservoirs was controlled by the \n\ngeodynamic evolution, and supplied by the recurrently uplifted basement terrains along \n\nthe border of the Campos Basin, during a major transgressive period; and (c) the classic \n\neustatic lowstand model of deepwater fan deposition is too simplistic and restrictive to \n\nbe used for the prediction of turbidite reservoirs in deepwater frontier areas at divergent \n\nmargin settings. \n\nConclusions  \n\nThe deepwater sand-supply in divergent continental margins is not exclusively \n\ncontrolled by eustatic sea level changes and fluvial-deltaic progradation, as stated by the \n\ncurrent paradigm of sequence-stratigraphy. It was shown that the sand budget in \n\ndeepwater during the evolution of a typical passive margin basin can be constrained by \n\nepisodic tectonism and magmatism, just as in active margin settings. Thick sandy \n\nturbidites can be deposited along divergent margins even during major eustatic \n\ntransgressive periods, as emphatically illustrated by Campos Basin giant turbidite \n\nreservoirs. \n\nThe composition and texture of turbidite sandstones can be used to unravel the \n\npaleogeographic and geodynamic evolution of passive margin systems in the same way \n\nas they are used in active margins. The combination of petrographic and structural \n\nanalyses allows the understanding of the tectonic versus eustatic controls on the \n\nturbidite deposition. The proposed approach can positively impact the prediction of \n\nreservoirs in deepwater frontier areas at divergent margins, as it envisages a broader \n\n\n\n 35\n\nspectrum of physiographic possibilities for the development of thick sand-rich turbidite \n\nsystems. \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nThis work is part of a doctorate research developed by M.

Such tectonic activity is episodic and \ncontrols salt tectonic pulses. Additionally, major basin features like the Neogene progradation front and \nthe salt tectonic domains are constrained by the main basement trends. As the basement involved \nstructures observed in Campos Basin can be attributed to general geodynamic processes, it is suggested \nthat basement tectonic reactivations can be as relevant as isostatic adjustments and detached tectonics on \nthe evolution of divergent margin settings.  \n\nKeywords: Divergent margin tectonics; salt tectonics; section restoration; geometric seismic attributes; \nstructural analysis; seismic interpretation. \n\nIntroduction \n\nThe structural analysis of divergent margin basins has been improved during the past \n\ndecades as a function of seismic coverage acquired by oil industry. The extensional \n\nstructural style of the rift-drift divergent margin model was initially observed in 2D \n\nseismic surveys (Falvey, 1974), and was soon after associated with the geodynamic \n\nmodel of mechanical-thermal subsidence caused by lithospheric stretching (McKenzie, \n\n1978; Le Pichon and Sibuet, 1981). The improvement in the quality of 2D seismic data \n\nallowed important advances in the field of detachment tectonics related to shale and salt \n\n(Doust and Omatsola, 1989; Jackson, 1995), and in the technology of section restoration \n\nof extensional structures (Gibbs, 1983; Rowan and Kligfield, 1989; Nunns, 1991). \n\nSubsequently there was a continuous progress in detailed structural analysis with local \n\n3D surveys (Hesthammer and Fossen, 1997; Cartwright and Huuse, 2005), particularly \n\nwith the use of geometric seismic attributes (Chopra and Marfurt, 2006). \n\nWith recent increasing oil prices and lowering acquisition and processing costs many \n\ndivergent margin basins are now also covered with extensive 3D seismic surveys. The \n\ninterpretation of this kind of detailed and extensive dataset has rendered possible a \n\nsubstantial advance in the structural analysis of divergent margin basins. In the Campos \n\nBasin, the most prolific oil province of Brazil, one of the main improvements obtained \n\nwith the structural analysis of recent regional 3D seismic surveys was the definition of \n\nthe structural style produced by the interaction between dominant detachment salt \n\ntectonics and strike-slip reactivations of the basement fabric (Fetter et al., 2002). In the \n\n\n\n 46\n\npresent work it is shown that this interaction can be well defined by the analysis of \n\ngeometric seismic attributes, with the aid of balanced cross-sections based on seismic \n\nhorizons tied to biostratigraphic markers. A remarkable observation is that even being \n\napparently subdued, basement tectonics appears to control salt tectonics pulses. If this \n\nreactive model of salt tectonics triggered by basement tectonic pulses is accepted, as it \n\nis indicated by evidence from Campos Basin, the current model, purely epeirogenic and \n\nrelated to escarpment retreat and mantle plume activity, assumed for the geodynamic \n\nevolution of the southeastern continental margin of Brazil should be revised. \n\nGeological Setting \n\nCampos Basin is located at the South Atlantic continental margin along the \n\nsoutheastern coast of Brazil (Fig. 1). The basin formation was initiated during the Late \n\nJurassic/Early Cretaceous break-up of the Gondwana supercontinent. Early mechanical \n\nsubsidence was accomplished by episodic events that reactivated main Proterozoic \n\nbasement fabric along regional E-W extension (Ponte and Asmus, 1976; Rabinowitz \n\nand LaBrecque, 1979; Mohriak and Dewey, 1987; Dias et al., 1990; Chang et al., 1992). \n\nThe lowermost Cretaceous was characterized by intense magmatic activity, \n\ncontemporaneous to the Paran\u00e1 Basin continental basalt floods (Hawkesworth et al., \n\n1992; Mizusaki et al., 1992; Wilson, 1992). Up to 3.5 km thick fault-controlled \n\ntaphrogenic successions were deposited from uppermost Valaginian to Barremian with \n\nvolcanogenic contribution at the base. During the Aptian a widespread transitional \n\nsiliciclastic and evaporitic succession was deposited over the break-up unconformity at \n\nalready thermal subsidence conditions. From this, it has been suggested that the \n\nextensional tectonic phase in the Campos Basin ended by Aptian times (Chang et al., \n\n1992). The divergent margin stage began at Albian and is still going on. Thermal \n\nsubsidence and sediment loading allowed the deposition of up to 7 km-thick, \n\ntransgressive-regressive marine successions (Fig. 2).   \n\nThe overall structural style in Campos Basin is detached (Fig. 1). The main structural \n\nfeatures in the basement are horsts and grabbens limited by steep normal faults active \n\nduring the rift phase in the Early Cretaceous (Dias et al., 1990; Chang et al., 1992). The \n\nthin-skinned salt tectonics with extensional-proximal and compressional-distal domains \n\nhave been active during divergent margin phase since the Albian, and is characterized \n\nby listric fault-rollover systems, turtle-back structures, raft tectonics, downbuilding \n\ndiapirs, salt walls, and compressional salt tongues (Cobbold and Szatmari, 1991; \n\n\n\n 47\n\nDemercian et al., 1993). The salt tectonic domains are controlled by the basement \n\nstructure, with extensional structures to the West, and diapirs, salt walls, and \n\ncompressional structures to the East of the main trend of internal basement highs (Fig. \n\n1). \n\nA regional basement map of Campos Basin (Fig. 2) was obtained by the integration \n\nof regional 3D seismic datasets, with complementary 2D seismic surveys to fill 3D \n\nacquisition gaps, and with the digital topographic model of the continental margin. This \n\nmap was converted from time to depth with a single basin scale velocity model, which \n\nis another product of regional seismic data integration. The integrated basement map \n\nsuggests that the Proterozoic fabric, defined in the basin by NE-SW and NNW-SSE \n\nbasement highs, controls the main depocenters of rift phase, as it is commonly observed \n\nin many rift systems (Michon and Sokoutis, 2005). It is important to observe that the \n\nbasement trends have been controlling also the progradation of the divergent margin \n\nphase, as it is suggested by the perfect fitting between the internal basement highs and \n\nthe limits of present continental rise (Figs. 1 and 2).  \n\nStructural Analysis of Seismic Data \n\nMost of the previous work published about the structural geology of Campos Basin \n\nwas based on 2D seismic data, and on magnetic and gravimetric data (Mohriak and \n\nDewey, 1987; Dias et al., 1990; Cobbold and Szatmari, 1991; Chang et al., 1992; \n\nDemercian et al., 1993). With the available data it was indicated the general detached \n\nstructure of the basin. It was also possible to define the main basement highs and \n\ndepocenters of the rift phase, and to get a good picture of the dominant salt tectonic \n\nstructural style of the divergent margin phase. More recently, with mapping of 3D \n\nseismic surveys, it was suggested that the Campos Basin structure is not completely \n\ndetached (Fetter et al., 2002). It was observed that basement fabric appears to have been \n\nsubjected to episodic strike-slip reactivations during the divergent margin phase, and \n\nthat the coupling between basement reactivations and salt tectonics can be observed at \n\nstructural highs.  \n\nIn the following examples it is shown that further evidence of basement strike-slip \n\nreactivation can be obtained from regional 3D seismic surveys, with the analysis of \n\ngeometric seismic attributes. Geometric attributes are robust images computed from 3D \n\nseismic data that define the morphology and lateral variability of seismic reflectors, so \n\nthat they are very useful for structural analysis (Chopra and Marfurt, 2006). In the \n\n\n\n 48\n\npresent work were used three types of geometric attributes: (i) dip - first derivative of \n\nstructure; (ii) curvature - second derivative of structure, and (iii) semblance - inverse of \n\namplitude variance.  \n\nLower Cretaceous Transpression  \n\nThe basement reactivation in the Early Creataceous was observed at the southern \n\nportion of Campos Basin in a 500 km2 area of folding with rhombohedral shape (Fig. 3). \n\nThe structural trend NE-SW is sub-parallel to the Proterozoic basement fabric. Up to \n\n1800 m thick taphrogenic and transitional strata, ranging in age from Barremian to \n\nAptian were folded by flexural slip under NNW-SSE shortening. The fold pattern, well \n\ndefined by the maximum curvature map, is quite regular and sinuous (Figs 3a and 3b), \n\nwith 1 km wavelength and 100 m amplitude (Fig. 3c). Fold axes are slightly rotated \n\ncounter-clockwise in relation to the main NE-SW structural trend (Fig. 3a). The \n\nrhombohedral folded area is interpreted as a transpressive structure related to left-lateral \n\nstrike-slip reactivation of steep basement shear zones trending NE-SW (insert of Fig. \n\n3a). As post-Aptian strata are not deformed, it is possible to place deformation in the \n\nEarly Cretaceous, still under the regional stress field of the rift phase with N-S \n\nmaximum horizontal stress (SHmax). This deformation phase is related to the end of \n\nextension, but there was not yet a rotation of the regional stress field. It is also \n\ninteresting to observe the alkaline magmatic activity during the Paleogene in southern \n\nCampos Basin, represented by the volcanic structure in Figures 3b and 3c. \n\nLower Cretaceous and Upper Cretaceous Transpression \n\nThe second example of tectonic reactivation during the Cretaceous was observed in a \n\n90 km2 area faulted and folded in northeastern Campos Basin (Fig. 4). The deformation \n\nof pre-Aptian successions (up to 1200 m thick) is given by quite complex thrust-faulting \n\nand folding (Fig. 4c). The strata ranging in age from Albian to Turonian (up to 1000 m \n\nthick) were subjected to more regular folding with 1km wavelength and 100 m \n\namplitude. Fold axes trending NE-SW show interference between Z and S sinuous \n\npatterns disposed en-echelon (Fig. 4a). The observed geometry is interpreted as a result \n\nof transpression caused by strike-slip reactivation of NNW-SSE basement fabric with \n\nright-lateral followed by left-lateral kinematics. The right-lateral Lower Cretaceous \n\ntranspression represents the end of regional E-W extension still related to a regional \n\nloading with N-S SHmax, as in the example in Figure 3. The left-lateral Upper \n\nCretaceous kinematics is related to the rotation of the regional SHmax to E-W caused \n\nby the ridge-push stress associated with the development of the South Atlantic mid-\n\n\n\n 49\n\noceanic spreading center. The structure was probably amplified by salt movement \n\nacross the section and by a buttress effect of the basement high (Fig. 4c). \n\nPaleogene Transpression \n\nNext example is contiguous to the previous one in northeastern Campos Basin, and is \n\ncharacterized by a huge fold with 3 km half-wavelength and 300 m amplitude affecting \n\nup to 2700 m of Upper-Cretaceous to Paleogene strata (Fig. 5). The structure is \n\ninterpreted as a fault-propagation fold (Suppe, 1985), and is clearly episodic with well \n\nconstrained pre-kinematics, sin-kinematics and post-kinematics phases (Fig. 5c). The \n\nmain deformation phase in the Eocene is indicated by onlap pattern and section growth \n\n(Fig. 5c). The fold was probably related to transpression associated with left-lateral \n\nreactivation of the NNW-SSE basement fabric during the Paleogene still under E-W \n\nmaximum horizontal stress. It appears that transpression caused the inversion of Lower \n\nAlbian normal faults (Fig. 5c). \n\nPaleogene Transtension and Salt Tectonics \n\nIn central Campos Basin, 100 km to the south of previous example of transpression, \n\nthe Paleogene reactivation event is characterized by normal faulting and section growth \n\n(Fig. 6). Most of the faults are restricted to Paleogene and older strata, and are \n\nconcentrated above a basement high (Fig. 6b). The faults are planar and discontinuous, \n\nand the fault system is characterized by a dispersed distribution of orientations around \n\nNNE-SSW (Fig. 6a and 6c). The structure is interpreted as a negative flower caused by \n\ntranstension (Woodcock and Schubert, 1994). The observed dispersion of fault \n\norientation distribution was probably caused by the strong coupling between stress \n\nfields related to both basement reactivation and detached gravitational gliding above the \n\nbasement high.  \n\nIn a contiguous area just to the west of the flower structure is observed a detached \n\nlistric fault-rollover system related to extensional salt tectonics (Fig.7). There is no \n\nstrong coupling with basement reactivation because the area is sufficiently far from the \n\ninfluence of the basement high to the East (Fig. 7c). The fault orientation distribution is \n\nconcentrated around NNW-SSE (Fig. 7d). The fault system was active from Albian to \n\nRecent time, but the imprint of Paleogene basement reactivation is indicated by extra \n\nsection growth at the antithetic fault of the rollover system (Fig. 7b). Farther south, \n\nPaleogene magmatism was indicated by the volcanic structure showed above (Fig. 3c). \n\nTectonic and magmatic reactivation along the Paleogene southeastern continental \n\nmargin of Brazil was already well documented (Mizusaki and Mohriak, 1992; Chang et \n\n\n\n 50\n\nal., 1992; Scarton, 1993; Almeida et al., 1996; Thompson et al., 1998; Thomaz Filho et \n\nal., 2005).   \n\nNeogene Transpression \n\nJust to the west of the rollover system, still in central Campos Basin, the Neogene \n\ndeformation is characterized by folding (Fig. 8). Observe that the anticline trending NE-\n\nSW is positioned exactly above the basement high (Fig. 8b). The structure is interpreted \n\nas an inversion fold that can be properly defined according to both the clay models of \n\nEisenstad and Withjack (1995), and the conceptual model of Sibson (1995). The \n\ninversion of listric normal faults related to gravitational gliding extension active from \n\nCretaceous to Paleogene was probably caused by transpression at the basement high \n\nduring Neogene (Figs. 8c and 8d). The Neogene folding is quite synchronous with the \n\nextra displacement of Lower Miocene horizon at the main fault of the rollover system \n\njust to the West (Fig. 7b). As the fold plane lie at high angle to the main rollover fault, \n\nthe folding and the extra extension can be associated with the same reactivation event.  \n\nOverview of structural analysis \n\nThe structural analysis of regional 3D seismic data indicates four periods of \n\nbasement reactivation during the divergent margin phase in Campos Basin (Table 1). \n\nThe timing of the Neogene and Paleogene deformation events is very well constrained. \n\nThe kinematical interpretation and the involved strata indicate two phases of \n\ndeformation during the Cretaceous, but the timing of the basement reactivation has a \n\ncertain degree of uncertainty. The deformation is subtle and sparse, with open folds and \n\nmoderate fault inversion observed mainly at regional and local basement highs. The \n\nreactivation has an overall strike-slip kinematical pattern.  \n\nSection Restoration \n\nSection restoration is another relevant improvement of structural analysis in \n\ndivergent margin basins because balanced cross-sections can generate quantitative \n\nchronological information about the kinematics of structural models (Nunns, 1991). In \n\npresent work five sections of the extensional salt tectonic domain in Campos Basin were \n\nrestored (sections HH\u2019, II\u2019, JJ\u2019, KK\u2019 and LL\u2019 in Fig. 2). The objective was to get a \n\nquantitative approach to the kinematical pattern of salt tectonics during the divergent \n\nmargin phase in order to investigate if the synchronicity between basement and salt \n\ntectonic pulses suggested in central Campos Basin (Figs. 6, 7 and 8) is a general rule. \n\n\n\n 51\n\nA very uniform restoration methodology was adopted because the objective was to \n\nget a general pattern. The five sections, defined in 3D seismic datasets, cut \n\nperpendicular to major detached extensional fault systems, and range from 18 km to 23 \n\nkm in length (Figs. 9 to 13). It was assumed that the basement and the rift phase \n\nsuccessions were not involved in the extensional deformation, and that the Aptian salt \n\nlayer is a regional detachment surface. Eleven horizons were interpreted in each section \n\nranging in age from Aptian to Recent (Table 2). The horizons were interpreted within a \n\nsequence-stratigraphy framework, and were tied to biostratigraphic markers that \n\ncorrespond to time intervals between 9 Ma and 19 Ma, except for the 1 Ma interval \n\nbetween the Sea Bottom and the Pleistocene at the top of the sections. The sections \n\nwere restored in 9 steps, from Sea Bottom (0 Ma) to Albian (99 Ma). This time span \n\ncorresponds to the divergent margin phase in Campos Basin. So that, the rift phase \n\ndeformation was not restored in present work.  \n\nRestoration was performed with the RECON package (PETROBRAS/TECGRAF-\n\nPUCRJ - Brazil). It was used a standard sequential restoration procedure recommended \n\nfor detached extensional sections, with isostatic adjustment and decompaction (Schultz-\n\nEla, 1991; Schultz-Ela, 1992; Rowan, 1993). Isostatic adjustment was local, with a fine \n\ndiscrete mesh. Decompaction was computed by a power-law porosity function: \n\n0\ncze? ? ?= , \n\nwhere ?  is the compacted porosity, 0?  is the initial decompacted porosity, c is the \n\nporosity decay parameter, and z is depth. The appropriated parameters for decompaction \n\nof shale, sandstone and carbonate in Campos Basin were defined by fitting the power-\n\nlaw function to a typical sonic porosity log (Table 3). For all sections, fault restoration \n\nwas computed by an algorithm of movement along fault trace with antithetic shear \n\nstrain in the moving block. \n\nWith the uniform procedure described above it was possible to restore quite well all \n\nthe five sections with the assumption of detached deformation (Figs. 9 to 13). During \n\nthe divergent margin phase in the restored sections from Campos Basin, since the \n\nAlbian (99 Ma), total extension ranges from 2.78 km to 5.07 km, with rates between 28 \n\nm/Ma and 51 m/Ma (Table 4). Section JJ\u2019, positioned far from the basement highs has \n\nthe lower extension rate (Table 4).  \n\nTaking a closer look to the extension measured in the sections since the Pleistocene \n\n(Table 5), it is possible to interpret the average total extension rate around 40 m/Ma \n\n(Table 4) as a background because the extensional process can reach up to 570 m/Ma \n\n\n\n 52\n\nepisodic peak rates (Section KK\u2019, Fig. 12). If this episodic behavior is extended for the \n\ndivergent margin phase as a whole, and assuming that the deformation has been \n\nconcentrated in time intervals around 1 Ma, it is possible to infer even higher peaks of \n\nextension rates (Fig. 14). The choice of the 1 Ma interval was based on the rates \n\nmeasured for the restored Pleistocene horizon, but is important to observe that the \n\nepisodic nature of extension measured in the restored sections is independent of the time \n\ninterval used to compute the extension rates. It also is important to observe that the \n\ndeformation peaks are quite synchronous in the five restored sections, particularly the \n\nPaleogene and Neogene peaks. The same episodic and synchronous pattern is indicated \n\nby the conventional engineering strain curves of the five restored sections (Fig. 15). So \n\nthat, section restoration indicates that the detached extension related to gravitational \n\ngliding above the Aptian salt in Campos Basin is characterized by an episodic and \n\nsynchronous pattern. Four deformation peaks were observed during the divergent \n\nmargin phase: Neogene, Paleogene, Upper Cretaceous, and Lower Cretaceous (Figs. 14 \n\nand 15). The detached extensional peaks can be well correlated with the basement \n\nreactivation events interpreted in 3D seismic surveys (Table 1).   \n\nDiscussion \n\nCampos Basin has been interpreted with the classic rift-drift detached model, \n\ncharacterized by shallow gravitational gliding above a quiet passive basement (Cobbold \n\nand Szatmari, 1991; Chang et al., 1992). The high elevations at the basin margin (Figs. \n\n1 and 2) have been attributed to isostatic models related to rift shoulder rebound, \n\nescarpment retreat, mantle plume activity, and magmatic underplating (Weissel and \n\nKarner, 1989; Gallagher et al., 1995; Thompson et al., 1998; Thomaz Filho et al., 2005; \n\nZal\u00e1n and Oliveira, 2005). Conversely, there are already some reported suggestions of \n\nbasement reactivations in the southeastern continental margin of Brazil (Assump\u00e7\u00e3o, \n\n1998; Gallagher and Brrown, 1999; Lima, 1999; Cobbold et al., 2001; Fetter et al., \n\n2002; Saenz et al., 2003), as well as in other divergent margins (Stein et al., 1989; \n\nWithjack et al., 1995; Bezerra and Vita-Finzi, 2000; Cramez and Jackson, 2000; Hudec \n\nand Jackson, 2004). No matter the proposed model, previous work was all based in \n\nregional information, magnetic and gravimetric data, apatite fission-track analysis, \n\nsparse 2D seismic lines and local 3D seismic data. In present work, even considering \n\nthe relevance of salt tectonics and isostatic processes, it is sustained, with three lines of \n\nevidence depicted from regional 3D seismic surveys and section restoration, that the \n\n\n\n 53\n\nstructural style of the divergent margin phase in Campos Basin may fit better a \n\ngeodynamic model that encompass episodic tectonic reactivations. \n\nThe first line of evidence indicating basement reactivation came from Campos Basin \n\nregional sections and maps (Figs. 1 and 2). Regional data show that the present \n\nprogradation front is controlled by the main structural highs of the basin. If the \n\nbasement has been completely passive it hardly could control the present major \n\nsedimentation trend, which would be controlled by salt tectonic structures. In fact, the \n\nsalt tectonics major domains are also controlled by the basement structure. Besides, \n\nthere are depocenters beyond the structural highs during the Cretaceous and the \n\nPaleogene (Fig. 1), suggesting that the stronger sedimentation constraint was \n\nestablished in the Neogene. \n\nThe second group of evidence of basement tectonic activity came from the structural \n\nanalysis of 3D seismic surveys. In section AA\u2019 it is observed that up to 1800 m of \n\nsediments were folded in a 500 km2 area, probably during the Lower Cretaceous, at the \n\nbeginning of the divergent margin phase (Fig. 3c). The kinematical interpretation can be \n\nquestioned, but the folding of Lower Cretaceous taphrogenic and transitional \n\nsuccessions can not be attributed to salt tectonics. Therefore, it is a concrete evidence of \n\nbasement reactivation. \n\nIn section BB\u2019 it is possible to observe the regular folding of up to 1000 m of early \n\ndivergent margin phase sediments (Fig. 4). The proposed kinematical model can be \n\nquestioned, but the structure can hardly be attributed to salt tectonics, instead it can be \n\nbetter interpreted as a result of transpression caused by basement reactivation because \n\nthe fold axes are sinuous and disposed en echelon (Woodcock and Schubert, 1994). The \n\nsection CC\u2019, in the same area, shows a huge fault-propagation fold active during the \n\nPaleogene (Fig. 5). The episodic character and the timing of the structure are quite \n\nevident. As section CC\u2019 is contiguous to section BB\u2019 (Figs. 2, 4 and 5), it is reasonable \n\nto interpret both folding events as results of successive reactivations of the same \n\nbasement structure. It seems unlikely that both structures (sections BB\u2019 and CC\u2019) had \n\nbeen generated by one single Paleogene event because affected strata and structural \n\nstyle are very different.  \n\nSections DD\u2019, FF\u2019 and GG\u2019 show a transition from extension during the Paleogene to \n\ncompression during the Neogene above a basement high (Figs. 2, 6 and 8). Both \n\nstructures can hardly be attributed to salt tectonics. They can be better interpreted as a \n\nresult of stress field rotation, with basement transtension followed by transpression. In \n\n\n\n 54\n\nthe same area, but sufficiently far from the basement high it is possible to observe a \n\nlistric fault-rollover system in section EE\u2019 (Figs. 2 and 7). The rollover is a typical salt \n\ntectonic structure that was active since the Albian. Nevertheless it shows the effects of \n\nboth Paleogene and Neogene basement reactivations (Fig. 7). \n\nThe third group of evidence about the relevance of basement tectonics came from \n\nbalanced cross-sections. Section restoration of five major detached structures indicates \n\nthat the extensional process have been episodic and synchronous during the divergent \n\nmargin phase in Campos Basin. Four main extension events were defined: Neogene, \n\nPaleogene, Upper Cretaceous, and Lower Cretaceous. These events can be well \n\ncorrelated with the basement reactivation events interpreted in regional 3D seismic \n\ndatasets (Table 1). This correlation suggests that salt tectonics have been controlled by \n\nbasement tectonics during the divergent margin phase in Campos Basin. Additionally, \n\nthe general correlation pattern is reinforced by a few local details:  \n\n(i) The less deformed detached system (Section JJ\u2019) is positioned relatively far \n\nfrom the main basement highs (Figs. 2, 11, and 14; Tables 4 and 5).  \n\n(ii) In southern Campos Basin, Section HH\u2019 show no extension during Lower \n\nCretaceous, at the same time of the folding event observed in section AA\u2019 \n\n(Figs. 2, 3, 9, and 14). As both structures trend NE-SW (Figs. 3 and 9), the \n\ndetached extension was inhibited by the compressive event.  \n\n(iii) In central Campos Basin, the Neogene extension rate is relatively low in \n\nsection II\u2019, during the inversion event interpreted in sections FF\u2019 and GG\u2019 \n\n(Figs. 2, 8, 10, and 14). Again, as both structures trend NE-SW (Figs. 8 and \n\n10), the detached extension was subdued by the compressive inversion. \n\nConsidering the presented field evidence of basement reactivation in Campos Basin, \n\nit is important to discuss about an adequate geodynamic model for the evolution of \n\ndivergent margins. According to the Wilson Cycle model, continental rift systems \n\neventually evolve to mid-ocean spreading centers at a new plate border, leaving behind \n\npassive continental margins at intraplate position. The evolution of the basement in \n\ndivergent margin basins is characterized by cooling (Sleep, 1971; Mckenzie, 1978), and \n\nby a transition from extension to compression (Le Pichon and Sibuet, 1981; Withjack et \n\nal., 1998). Possible sources of compression are related to ridge push (Bott, 1992), to \n\nspreading stresses (Stein et al., 1989), to flexural compressive stresses associated with \n\nsediment loading (Stein et al., 1989), and to the remote effect of active margin processes \n\n(Ziegler et al., 1995). Additionally, the crust is thin, weak and prone of basement shear \n\n\n\n 55\n\nzones bellow divergent margin basins (Mckenzie, 1978; Le Pichon and Barbier, 1987; \n\nLister et al., 1991). So that, the tectonic reactivation in divergent margin basins is not \n\nonly possible, actually it seems to be expected, as it has been suggested in other \n\nintraplate settings (Storti et al., 2003). \n\nConclusions \n\nCampos Basin was subjected to episodic tectonic reactivations during the divergent \n\nmargin phase, from Albian to Recent time. The structural style indicates a strike-slip \n\nkinematical pattern for the reactivations. Deformation has been concentrated above \n\nmain structural highs and probably reflects the coupling between divergent margin \n\nsediments and active basement shear zones. \n\nThe interference between basement tectonics and detached gravitational gliding \n\ninferred from the interpretation of 3D seismic data was confirmed by quantitative \n\ninformation obtained from section restoration of detached extensional structures. The \n\ndetached extension, previously attributed exclusively to salt tectonics, is also episodic \n\nand synchronous in Campos Basin, and the extensional events can be well correlated \n\nwith basement tectonic pulses interpreted in regional 3D seismic datasets: Neogene, \n\nPaleogene, Upper Cretaceous, and Lower Cretaceous.  \n\nThe basement highs control also major basin features like the present front of \n\nNeogene progradation and the salt tectonic domains. So that it is possible to conclude \n\nthat basement tectonics has been exerting an important control on the structural and \n\nstratigraphic evolution of the divergent margin phase in Campos Basin. Additionally, it \n\nis suggested that basement tectonic reactivations can be as relevant as isostatic \n\nadjustments and detached tectonics on the evolution of divergent margin settings, \n\nbecause the basement involved structures observed in Campos Basin can be attributed \n\nto general geodynamic processes. \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nPresent work was developed as part of a doctorate research project at Geosciences \nGraduate Program of Rio Grande do Sul Federal University (UFRGS \u2013 Porto Alegre, \nBrazil) sponsored by Petrobras.

Observe \nLower-Cretaceous strata folded at Albian times. Fold axes are indicated by darker high \nmaximum curvature trends. The structure is interpreted as a result of transpression \nrelated to left-lateral strike-slip reactivation of NE-SW basement fabric. SHmax is the \nmaximum horizontal stress. \n\nFigure 4 - (a) Dip map of Albian horizon and insert with kinematic interpretation. \nObserve mixed S and Z sinuous pattern of en-echelon fold axes at Albian strata.

Up to \n2700 m of Upper Cretaceous and Paleogene strata where folded during the Eocene. The \nmain deformation phase is indicated by onlap and section growth in the Eocene. The \nstructure is interpreted as a fault propagation fold associated with inversion of Albian \nlistric normal faults. Inversion was probably caused by transpression along NW-SE \nbasement fabric at northeastern Campos Basin. The structure is contiguous to the \nfolding area of Figure 4. \n\nFigure 6 \u2013 (a) Semblance map of Maastrichtian horizon showing a NNE-SSW fault \nsystem.

The major detrital compositional trends \nindicate that the geodynamic evolution of the continental margin, rather than global eustatic sea level \nfluctuations, has exerted the main control on sand supply to the deepwater systems. This control was \nimposed by the interaction of three geodynamic processes: (i) escarpment retreat of the coastal mountain \nchains, (ii) mantle plume-related dynamic uplift and magmatic activity, and (iii) tectonic reactivation of \nmajor basement fault-zones. The pattern of distribution of compositional and textural parameters within \nthe turbidite sequences indicated that the sand supply to deepwater was also constrained by high-\nfrequency stratigraphic processes of the climate Milankovitch band. This new approach to the controls on \nthe formation of the sand-rich deepwater systems in Campos Basin will be of key importance to generate \nrealistic models for the exploration of new turbidite reservoirs and for the optimized development of \nproducing turbidite oilfields in such a world-class hydrocarbon province. As it is very simple, the \nproposed integrated methodology can help to unravel the controls on the deposition of deepwater sand-\nrich reservoirs in other divergent margin settings.  \n\n   \n\nKeywords: Turbidite reservoirs, quantitative petrography, structural analysis, divergent margins, mantle \nplumes, intraplate tectonics, paleogeography, sequence stratigraphy. \n \n\n1. Introduction \n\nCampos Basin (Fig. 1) is by far the most prolific oil province in Brazil. Up to 93% of \n\nthe 8.5 billion bbl proven hydrocarbon reserves in Campos Basin are contained in sand-\n\nrich turbidite reservoirs deposited in deepwater settings during the divergent margin \n\nphase from the Albian to the Miocene (Bruhn et al., 2003). As many other divergent \n\nmargin settings, the structural and stratigraphic evolution of Campos Basin and the \n\nadjacent basins along eastern Brazilian continental margin have been studied with \n\nclassic approaches such as lithospheric stretching, escarpment retreat, sequence \n\nstratigraphy, and detached salt tectonics (Dias et al., 1990; Cobbold and Szatmari, 1991; \n\nChang et al., 1992; Peres, 1993; Gallagher et al., 1995; Souza Cruz, 1995). However, \n\nthis conventional conceptual background was not able to define the controls for the \n\ndevelopment of the large deepwater hydrocarbon reservoirs of Campos Basin. This \n\nquestion remains open probably because the methods and data used for the analysis of \n\n\n\n 76\n\nCampos Basin are inadequate for unraveling the conditions for the deposition of \n\ndeepwater sand-rich systems in such a complex tectonic-stratigraphic setting. \n\nCampos Basin turbidites show strong compositional and textural immaturity, \n\nconversely to the pattern typical of passive divergent margins (Scarton, 1993; Bruhn \n\nand Walker, 1995; Caddah et al., 1998). Large volumes of gravel and sand were \n\ndeposited in deepwater during the Upper Cretaceous transgression, when the sea-level \n\nwas, in average, 200 m higher than the present (Bruhn and Walker, 1995; Caddah et al., \n\n1998; Santos et al., 1999). Additionally, the Upper Cretaceous and Paleogene \n\nstratigraphic record of Campos Basin cannot be correlated with the global 3rd order sea-\n\nlevel cycles defined according to the conventional sequence stratigraphic concepts \n\n(Scarton, 1993; Pereira, 1994; Bruhn and Walker, 1995).  \n\nIn the present work, an integrated approach combining quantitative petrography and \n\nstructural analysis is proposed to improve the understanding of the deepwater sand-rich \n\nsystems in Campos Basin. Quantitative petrography of deepwater sandstones is a \n\npowerful source of information on the paleogeographic evolution of source-basin \n\nsystems (Zuffa, 1987; 1991; Zuffa et al., 1995; 2000). The structural analysis of \n\nregional 3D seismic datasets was focused on the evidence of basement tectonic \n\nreactivations observed during the divergent margin phase in Campos Basin (Cobbold et \n\nal., 2001; Fetter et al., 2002). \n\n2. Geological Setting \n\nThe development of Campos Basin was initiated during the Late-Jurassic/Early-\n\nCretaceous break-up of Gondwana supercontinent, followed by the opening of the \n\nSouth Atlantic Ocean. Early mechanical subsidence was accomplished by episodic \n\nevents that reactivated the Proterozoic basement fabric under regional E-W extension \n\n(Ponte and Asmus, 1976; Rabinowitz and LaBrecque, 1979; Mohriak and Dewey, 1987; \n\nDias et al., 1990; Chang et al., 1992; Karner, 2000). Thermal subsidence started during \n\nthe Aptian, which was characterized by evaporitic-rich sedimentation, and has \n\nproceeded during the oceanic phase from the Albian to the Recent. \n\nMost of the Campos Basin border corresponds to the Neo-Proterozoic Ribeira Belt \n\n(Figs. 2 and 3), which is the northernmost expression of a NE-SW trending orogenic \n\nsystem mostly controlled by steep strike-slip shear belts (Campos Neto, 2000). From \n\nNeo-Proterozoic to Middle Cambrian NE-SW oriented shearing accommodated the \n\namalgamation of several terrains and crustal shortening along the Ribeira Belt. The \n\n\n\n 77\n\nnorthern limit of the Ribeira Belt is defined by the Vit\u00f3ria-Colatina shear zone (Chang \n\net al., 1992), a major long-lived Proterozoic structure trending NNW-SSE (Fig. 3). \n\n2.1. Mantle plumes and magmatism \n\nIntense magmatic activity took place in Campos Basin during the lowermost \n\nCretaceous, which may have been associated with the Trist\u00e3o da Cunha mantle plume. \n\nThis magmatism resulted in the extrusion of basalts, geochemically similar to the \n\ncontinental flood basalts of the Paran\u00e1 Basin magmatic province (Fig. 1) \u2013 CFB affinity \n\n(Hawkesworth et al., 1992; Mizusaki et al., 1992; Wilson, 1992).  \n\nA new pulse of magmatic activity, associated with the Trindade mantle plume (Fig. \n\n1), is observed in the Upper Cretaceous and the Paleogene. The basic-alkaline rocks \n\ngenerated by this magmatism show a compositional correlation with ocean island \n\nbasalts \u2013 OIB affinity (Thompson et al., 1998). \n\n2.2. Stratigraphy \n\nThe stratigraphic record of Campos Basin can be subdivided in two major 2nd-order \n\nsequences. During the extensional phase (Valaginian to Barremian), an up to 3.5 km \n\nthick, 2nd-order sequence formed by fault-controlled taphrogenic successions was \n\ndeposited, with volcanogenic contribution at the base (Fig. 2). The second, up to 7 km-\n\nthick, 2nd-order sequence started to accumulate during the Aptian, with a transitional \n\nsiliciclastic, carbonatic, and evaporitic succession, which was followed by an early \n\nAlbian shallow carbonate platform, and a late Albian to Recent marine transgressive to \n\nregressive succession (Fig. 2).  \n\nThermal subsidence and sediment loading allowed the deposition of the \n\ntransgressive-regressive marine succession, which contains several turbidite systems \n\nranging in age from late Albian to Miocene. The thermal subsidence and the global sea-\n\nlevel rise allowed a transgressive setting for entire Upper Cretaceous, with the \n\nmaximum transgression achieved in the early Paleocene.  \n\nDuring the Paleogene, there was intense sea-level variation, with the development of \n\nmany 3rd-order sequences, but the overall stratigraphic pattern is slightly progradational \n\n(Fig. 2). The mainly regressive sedimentation started in the Neogene, and is presently \n\ngoing on; it has been characterized by an expressive progradation that has been building \n\na wide continental shelf in the Campos Basin (Figs. 2 and 3). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 78\n\n2.3. Structural geology and tectonics \n\nThe overall structural style in Campos Basin is detached (Fig. 2). The main structural \n\nfeatures in the basement are horsts and grabbens limited by steep normal faults active \n\nduring the Early Cretaceous rift phase (Dias et al., 1990; Chang et al., 1992). The \n\nbasement structural fabric is dominated by two main directions: (i) NE-SW, associated \n\nwith the Ribeira Orogenic Belt, and (ii) NNW-SSE, associated with the Vit\u00f3ria-Colatina \n\nshear zone (Fig. 3). \n\nThe thin-skinned salt tectonics with extensional-proximal and compressional-distal \n\ndomains have been active during divergent margin phase since the Early Albian, and is \n\ncharacterized by listric fault-rollover systems, turtle-back structures, raft tectonics, \n\ndownbuilding diapirs, salt walls, and compressional salt tongues (Cobbold and \n\nSzatmari, 1991; Demercian et al., 1993). More recently it was observed that the overall \n\ndetached structural style has been disturbed by episodic strike-slip reactivations of the \n\nbasement structures during the divergent margin phase in Campos Basin (Cobbold et \n\nal., 2001; Fetter et al., 2002). \n\nFrom a geodynamic point of view it is important to mention the presence of tall \n\nmountains of the Serra do Mar (Sea Ridge), constituted of uplifted terrains of the \n\nRibeira Orogenic Belt, along the basin border (Figs 2 and 3). The persistence of up to \n\n2700 m high elevations at around 75 km from the rift border 130 Ma after the main \n\nextensional rift phase suggests that the continental margin adjacent to Campos Basin \n\nhas not been exactly a tectonically passive setting.  \n\n3. Petrography \n\nIn the present work we performed quantitative petrographic analysis of the main \n\nturbidite systems deposited in Campos Basin during the divergent margin phase. The \n\npetrographic analysis was developed on 121 thin sections sampled along 990 m of cores \n\nfrom 10 wells representative of 11 turbidite systems ranging in age from the Albian to \n\nthe Miocene (Fig. 4; Table 1). The Gazzi-Dickinson point-counting method (Gazzi, \n\n1966; Dickinson, 1970; Dickinson and Suczec, 1979; Ingersoll et al., 1984; Zuffa, 1985) \n\nwas used, with 300 points counted per thin section. \n\nMost of the analyzed samples correspond to arkoses (sensu Folk, 1968), and just a \n\nfew samples of the Maastrichtian samples are classified as lithic arkoses (Fig. 5). \n\nAccording to the high-hierarchy grain origin classification of Zuffa (1980), most of the \n\nsamples show a siliciclastic, non-carbonate extrabasinal composition (NCE), with \n\n\n\n 79\n\ndepartures towards a carbonate intrabasinal (CI) contribution during the Albian and the \n\nLate Eocene, and towards a non-carbonate intrabasinal (NCI) contribution during the \n\nSantonian and the Paleocene (Fig. 6). The Cenomanian and the Miocene reservoirs \n\nshow a mixed contribution from CI and NCI, and a departure towards the field of hybrid \n\narenites (sensu Zuffa, 1980; Fig. 6). \n\nThe extrabasinal composition of most Campos Basin deepwater sand-rich systems \n\ncorresponds to the uplifted basement block field in the tectonic provenance diagram of \n\nDickinson and Suczec (1979) and Dickinson (1985), which is typical of rift basins and \n\nimmature divergent margins (Fig. 7). The Upper Oligocene samples show a consistent \n\ndeparture towards the field of transitional continent field, typical of mature divergent \n\nmargins (Fig. 7). The Maastrichtian reservoir shows a not expected compositional trend \n\ntowards the volcanic arc field (Fig. 7). \n\nThe overall results of turbidite petrography, and the integrated analysis of the \n\nclassification diagrams (Figs. 5, 6 and 7), indicate the most significant petrographic \n\nparameters for the study of the paleogeographic evolution of Campos Basin divergent \n\nmargin phase (Table 2). The main parameters are the quartz to feldspar ratio (Q/F) and \n\nthe grain size. The content of volcanic rock fragments (VRF), the carbonate intrabasinal \n\ncontribution (CI), and the content of non-carbonate intrabasinal grains (NCI, mainly \n\nmud intraclasts and glaucony) also seem to be very diagnostic of the type of connection \n\nbetween the sediment source areas and the deepwater depositional sites. The content of \n\nmicaceous grains is related to the long term evolution of the continental margin. \n\n3.1. Albian \n\nThe petrographic analysis of the Albian turbidite reservoir (Well 01; Fig. 4; Tables 1 \n\nand 2) indicates, in average, an arkose composition with quartz to feldspar ratio Q/F = \n\n1.02, and fine sand grain size. The sand grains are sub-angular to sub-rounded, with \n\nmoderate to good sorting (Fig. 8). \n\nThere is a well-defined pattern for the internal variation of composition and texture \n\n(Fig. 9). Although the fine sand grain size is quite constant along the core, the Q/F ratio \n\nshows high-frequency cyclicity, with a growing upwards trend. \n\nThe contribution of carbonate intrabasinal grains (CI) is very high (Figs. 8b, 8e, 8f, \n\nand 9), and their distribution follows that of Q/F ratio, with a high-frequency cyclicity \n\nsuperimposed to a growing upwards trend (Fig. 9). Calcite cementation is widespread \n\n(Fig. 8), probably due to the source and nuclei provided by carbonate intraclasts, \n\nbioclasts and ooids, as well as by the proximity to Albian carbonate successions. The \n\n\n\n 80\n\ncontent of mica grains is also high (Fig. 8c), and a few foliated, low-grade metamorphic \n\nrock fragments where observed (Fig. 8a). The contents of volcanic rock fragments, mud \n\nintraclasts, and glaucony are low. \n\n3.2. Cenomanian \n\nThe petrography of the Cenomanian turbidite reservoir (Well 02; Fig. 4; Tables 1 and \n\n2) indicates, in average, an arkose composition with quartz to feldspar ratio Q/F = 1.00, \n\nand fine sand grain size. The sand grains are sub-angular to sub-rounded, with moderate \n\nsorting (Fig. 10). Plutonic rock fragments up to cobble-size where observed in poorly-\n\nsorted conglomeratic sandstone samples (Fig. 10e). There is no recognizable cyclic \n\npattern of compositional and textural internal variation as for the Albian deepwater \n\nsystem. \n\nThe carbonate intrabasinal contribution (Fig. 10a) is smaller than in the Albian \n\nreservoir, but is still fairly high. Calcite cementation is widespread (Fig. 10), probably \n\nfor the same reasons invoked for the Albian. On the other hand, there is a significant \n\nincrement in the intraclast content (Fig. 10f). The content of micaceous grains is quite \n\nsignificant (Fig. 10d). The volcanic contribution and the glaucony content are low. \n\n \n\n3.3. Santonian \n\nThe petrographic analysis of the Santonian deepwater sand-rich system (Well 03; \n\nFig. 4; Tables 1 and 2) indicates, in average, an arkose composition with low quartz to \n\nfeldspar ratio (Q/F = 0.88), and medium sand grain size. The sand grains are sub-\n\nangular to sub-rounded, with poor to moderate sorting (Fig. 11). Up to cobble-size \n\nfeldspar grains where observed in very poorly-sorted conglomeratic sandstone samples \n\n(Fig. 11e). The internal compositional and textural variation shows a direct correlation \n\nbetween the grain size and the quartz to feldspar ratio (Fig. 12). \n\nThe content of mud intraclasts is very high. The intraclasts are compacted into \n\npseudo-matrix, and commonly replaced by opaline silica or by calcite (Figs. 11a, 11b, \n\nand 11c). There is a significant drop in the contents of carbonate intrabasinal grains and \n\nof micaceous grains relative to the Albian and Cenomanian. The glaucony content and \n\nthe volcanic contribution are still low. \n\n3.4. Campanian \n\nThe Campanian turbidite reservoir (Well 04; Fig. 4; Tables 1 and 2) corresponds in \n\naverage, to an arkose composition with very low quartz to feldspar ratio (Q/F = 0.69), \n\n\n\n 81\n\nand medium sand grain size. The sand grains are sub-angular to sub-rounded, with poor \n\nto moderate sorting (Fig. 13). The internal variation pattern of composition and texture \n\nis not well-defined. \n\nThe content of mud intraclasts is high (Fig. 13b), as well as the contribution of \n\nvolcanic rock fragments (Figs. 13d and 13e). The content of micaceous grains is very \n\nsignificant. The contents of intrabasinal carbonate and glaucony grains are very low. \n\n3.5. Maastrichtian \n\nThe Maastrichtian turbidite reservoir (Well 05; Fig. 4; Tables 1 and 2) represents to a \n\nmajor deepwater sand-rich system in Campos Basin with huge sand volumes in \n\nnortheastern, northern and southern portions of the basin. The petrographic analysis \n\nindicates, in average, a lithic arkose composition with very low quartz to feldspar ratio \n\n(Q/F = 0.65), and medium sand grain size. The sand grains are sub-angular to sub-\n\nrounded, with poor sorting (Fig. 14). There is no recognizable trend of internal variation \n\nof composition and texture. \n\nThe contribution of volcanic rock fragments is very high (Figs. 14a and 14f). The \n\nintraclast content is lower than in the Santonian and Campanian reservoirs, but is still \n\nsignificant, as well as the content of micaceous grains (Figs. 14d and 14e). There is also \n\na significant contribution of carbonaceous fragments with features indicative of charcoal \n\n(burned wood; Figs. 14d and 14e). The carbonate intrabasinal (CI) and the glaucony \n\ncontents remain very low. \n\n3.6. Paleocene \n\nThe petrographic analysis of the Paleocene deepwater sand-rich system (Well 06; \n\nFig. 4; Tables 1 and 2) indicates, in average, an arkose composition with low quartz to \n\nfeldspar ratio (Q/F = 0.75), and medium sand grain size. The sand grains are sub-\n\nangular to sub-rounded, with moderate to poor sorting (Fig. 15).There is a good \n\ncorrelation between grain size and quartz to feldspar ratio (Fig. 12). \n\nThe amounts of volcanic rock fragments (Figs. 15b, 15c, and 15e) and of intraclasts \n\n(Figs. 15d and 15f) are very high. The contribution of carbonate intrabasinal grains is \n\nalso important (Figs. 15d and 15e). There is a significant contribution of glaucony \n\npeloids and intraclasts (Figs. 15d and 15f), and a significant drop in the content of \n\nmicaceous grains. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 82\n\n3.7. Middle Eocene \n\nThe Middle Eocene turbidite reservoir (Well 06; Fig. 4; Tables 1 and 2) corresponds \n\nto thick deepwater sand-rich systems that fill fault controlled troughs in Campos Basin. \n\nThe petrographic analysis indicates, in average, an arkose composition with low quartz \n\nto feldspar ratio (Q/F = 0.77), and medium sand grain size. The sand grains are sub-\n\nangular to sub-rounded, with moderate to poor sorting (Fig. 16). The internal variation \n\nof composition and texture shows a fairly good correlation between the grain size and \n\nthe quartz to feldspar ratio (Fig. 12). \n\nThe content of mud intraclasts is very high (Fig. 16f). The glaucony content is lower \n\nthan in the Paleocene, but still significant (Fig. 16a). There is a drop in the contribution \n\nof volcanic rock fragments, carbonate intrabasinal grains (CI), and micaceous grains. It \n\nis important to mention the presence of large mud fragments with internal textures \n\ntypical of soils (Fig. 16d) and of laminated microbialite fragments (Fig. 16e) in the \n\nconglomeratic turbidites. \n\n3.8. Upper Eocene \n\nThe petrography of the Upper Eocene turbidite reservoir (Well 06; Fig. 4; Tables 1 \n\nand 2) indicates, in average, an arkose composition with very low quartz to feldspar \n\nratio (Q/F = 0.71), and medium sand grain size. The sand grains are sub-angular to sub-\n\nrounded, with moderate to poor sorting (Fig. 17). As in other analyzed deepwater \n\nsystems, there is a direct correlation between grain size and quartz to feldspar ratio (Fig. \n\n12). \n\nThe contents of intrabasinal carbonate and glaucony grains are very high (Figs. 17a, \n\n17c, 17e, and 17f). as the contribution of mud intraclasts. The content of micaceous \n\ngrains is quite significant (Fig. 17b). The contribution of volcanic rock fragments is \n\neven lower than in the Middle Eocene turbidite system. \n\n3.9. Lower Oligocene \n\nThe Lower Oligocene turbidite reservoir (Well 07; Fig. 4; Tables 1 and 2) \n\ncorresponds in average, to an arkose composition with low quartz to feldspar ratio (Q/F \n\n= 0.82), and fine sand grain size. The sand grains are sub-angular to sub-rounded, with \n\nmoderate sorting (Fig. 18). There is no recognizable pattern of internal variation of \n\ncomposition and texture. \n\nThe content of mud intraclasts is very high (Fig. 18c). The contribution of carbonate \n\nintrabasinal grains is also significant (Figs. 18a and 18e). The contents of volcanic rock \n\n\n\n 83\n\nfragments and glaucony grains are very low. There is also a significant drop in the \n\ncontent of micaceous grains. \n\n3.10. Upper Oligocene \n\nThe Upper Oligocene reservoir (Wells 08 and 09; Fig. 4; Tables 1 and 2) corresponds \n\nto another major deepwater system with huge sand volumes in central, northeastern, and \n\nnorthern Campos Basin. The petrography of this reservoir indicates, in average, an \n\narkose composition with high quartz to feldspar ratio (Q/F = 1.40), and fine sand grain \n\nsize. The sand grains are sub-angular to sub-rounded, with poor to moderate sorting \n\n(Fig. 19).  \n\nAs in the Abian reservoir, the internal variation of composition and texture is well \n\norganized (Fig. 20). The fine sand grain size is dominant, with levels of medium size. \n\nThe quartz to feldspar ratio (Q/F) shows a growing-upwards trend superimposed by a \n\nhigh-frequency cyclicity. There is also a well-defined step with higher quartz content in \n\nthe upper-half of the cored section.  \n\nThe content of carbonate intrabasinal grains (Figs. 19b and 19d), of mud intraclasts \n\n(Fig. 19e), and of volcanic rock fragments are significant, but lower than in the \n\npreviously-described turbidite systems. The contents of glaucony and micaceous grains \n\nare very low. \n\n3.11. Miocene \n\nThe petrographic analysis of the Miocene turbidite reservoir (Well 10; Fig. 4; Tables \n\n1 and 2) indicates, in average, an arkose composition with low quartz to feldspar ratio \n\n(Q/F = 0.91), and fine sand grain size. The sand grains are sub-angular to sub-rounded, \n\nwith moderate to good sorting (Fig. 21). Up to very coarse sand feldspar grains where \n\nobserved in poorly-sorted sandstone samples (Fig. 21f). There is a fining-upwards trend \n\nfrom medium sand to very fine sand grain size, as well as a growing-upwards trend of \n\nthe quartz to feldspar ratio (Fig. 22). \n\nThe contents of glaucony (Figs. 21d and 21e) and carbonate intrabasinal grains (Figs. \n\n21a, 21b, 21c and 21f) are significant. The content of mud intraclasts is low. The \n\ncontribution of volcanic rock fragments and micaceous grains are very low. \n\n4. Average petrographic trends \n\nIt was observed in the previous section that the Albian, Upper Oligocene, and \n\nMiocene turbidite systems show well-defined variation of the compositional and \n\ntextural parameters, with internal trends and cyclicity (Figs. 9, 20, and 22). Another \n\n\n\n 84\n\ninternal petrographic trend was observed in the Santonian and Paleogene deepwater \n\nsandstones, which show a fairly good correlation between grain size and quartz to \n\nfeldspar ratio (Fig. 12). Below we compare the average petrographic parameters of the \n\nanalyzed deepwater sand-rich systems, which also show defined trends during the \n\ndivergent margin phase of Campos Basin (Table 2). \n\n4.1. Quartz to feldspar ratio (Q/F) and grain size \n\nThe average quartz to feldspar ratio - Q/F (Fig. 23) starts with a value around 1.00 in \n\nthe Albian and the Cenomanian, and drops almost linearly to 0.65 in the Maastrichtian. \n\nThen the ratio grows a little to 0.75 in the Paleocene and Middle Eocene, and drops \n\nagain to 0.70 during the Upper Eocene. There is an exponential increase in Q/F from the \n\naverage 0.75 during the Paleogene to 1.4 in the Upper Oligocene, and an equally strong \n\ndrop to 0.90 in the Miocene. \n\nThe trend of average grain size (Fig. 24) starts with fine sand during the Albian and \n\nthe Cenomanian and changes to medium sand from Santonian to Upper Eocene. There \n\nare shifts towards coarse sand limit during the Maastrichtian and during the Upper \n\nEocene. The average grain size returns to fine sand from Lower Eocene to Miocene. \n\nThe cross-plot of the parameters grain size and quartz to feldspar ratio allows the \n\ndefinition of two types of deepwater sand-rich systems (Fig. 25). The first type is \n\nrepresented by the Albian, Cenomanian, Lower Oligocene, Upper Oligocene, and \n\nMiocene turbidite systems. This group has a relatively higher compositional and \n\ntextural maturity, as it is characterized by a close to 1:1 quartz to feldspar proportion \n\n(Q/F = 1.00) and by fine sand grain size. The Upper Oligocene reservoir has the highest \n\nquartz to feldspar ratio of this group (Q/F = 1.40). \n\nThe second type is formed by the Santonian, the Campanian, the Maastrichtian, the \n\nPaleocene, the Middle Eocene, and the Upper Eocene reservoir systems (Fig. 25). This \n\ngroup is more immature compositional and texturally, as characterized by an around to \n\n3:4 quartz to feldspar proportion (Q/F=0.75) and average medium grain size. In this \n\ngroup, the Maastrichtian reservoir has the lowest quartz to feldspar ratio (Q/F = 0.65). \n\n4.2. Volcanic rock fragments \n\nThe background amount of volcanic rock fragments in Campos Basin turbidite \n\nreservoirs is around 1% (Fig. 26). There is an episodic pulse of volcanic contribution \n\nthat reaches almost 9.00% during the Maastrichtian (Fig 26), up to 3.10% during the \n\nCampanian, and up to 4.50% during the Paleocene. \n\n\n\n 85\n\n \n\n \n\n4.3. Intrabasinal carbonate grains \n\nThe contribution of carbonate intrabasinal grains (CI) to turbidite systems encompass \n\nmainly bioclasts and ooids generated at shallow-water settings in carbonate platforms \n\nand ramps. It may also comprise planktonic bioclasts and intraclasts from slope settings. \n\nAverage CI content was initially high in Campos Basin deepwater sand-rich systems in \n\nthe Albian (up to 13%), and later dropped progressively to zero in the Maastrichtian \n\n(Fig. 27). There was a strong oscillation of CI content during the Lower Paleogene that \n\nculminated with a peak around 18% in the Upper Eocene (Fig. 27). Then the average CI \n\ndrops again to around 5% during the Oligocene, and grows again to 7.5% in the \n\nMiocene (Fig. 27). \n\n4.4. Mud intraclasts  \n\nThe contribution of mud intraclasts to the Campos Basin deepwater sand-rich \n\nsystems was very low in the Albian (around 1%), and reaches a step above 10% from \n\nthe Cenomanian to the Lower Oligocene (Fig. 28). During this period of high intraclast \n\ncontent there were a drop to around 8% in the Maastrichtian, and two peaks above 12% \n\nin the Santonian, and in the Lower Paleogene. The average content of mud intraclasts \n\ndrops to around 5% during the Upper Oligocene and the Miocene (Fig. 28). \n\n4.5. Glaucony \n\nThe background of glaucony content in Campos Basin turbidite reservoirs is less \n\nthan 0.5% (Fig. 29). There are two peaks of glaucony content around 2% in the \n\nPaleocene and Miocene, and another peak of almost 5% in the Upper Eocene (Fig. 29). \n\n4.6. Micaceous grains \n\nThe content of micaceous grains in Campos Basin deepwater sand-rich systems \n\nshows a pattern of oscillation between 1% and 3% (Fig. 30). This pattern is \n\nsuperimposed to a trend of decreasing micaceous content from 3.5% in the Albian to \n\n0.5% in the Miocene (dashed arrow in Fig. 30). \n\n5. Structural analysis of basin deformation through basement faults reactivation \n\nIn convergent margin basins, the quantitative petrographic analysis of deepwater \n\nsand-rich systems has shown that the physiographic evolution of source-basin systems \n\nand the compositional-textural character of turbidites are essentially controlled by the \n\n\n\n 86\n\ntectonic activity (Fontana et al., 1989; Cibin et al., 2001). It is also already known that \n\ndivergent margins are subjected to intraplate tectonic activity (Stein et al., 1989; \n\nWithjack et al., 1995; Bezerra and Vita-Finzi, 2000). Although the geodynamic energy \n\ninvolved in the tectonic processes in divergent margins is lower than in convergent \n\nmargins, the amount of tectonic energy needed to change the physiography of the \n\nsource-basin system and consequently the petrography of deepwater sediments is \n\nlargely unknown. In order to investigate the possible effects of tectonic activity on the \n\npetrography of Campos Basin deepwater sand-rich reservoirs, it was performed a \n\ndetailed analysis of basement structures involved with already documented strike-slip \n\nreactivations of the Proterozoic fabric (Cobbold et al., 2001; Fetter et al., 2002).  \n\nThe structural analysis was developed with seismic attribute maps and sections \n\nselected from regional 3D seismic datasets recently acquired in Campos Basin (Fig. 31). \n\nAll the seismic data was subjected to pre-stack time migration in order to improve the \n\nstructural imaging. The depth-conversion was done with a basin-scale velocity model \n\nsufficiently smooth to avoid artifacts caused by local velocity bias. The velocity model \n\nwas calibrated with an evenly distributed set of time-depth tables computed from check-\n\nshot data. \n\n5.1. Albian-Cenomanian Transpression \n\nThe first example of basement reactivation was observed at the southern portion of \n\nCampos Basin in a 500 km2 area of folding with rhombohedral shape (Fig. 32). The \n\nstructural trend NE-SW is sub-parallel to Proterozoic basement fabric. Up to 1800 m \n\nthick taphrogenic and transitional strata, ranging in age from Barremian to Aptian were \n\nfolded by flexural slip under NNW-SSE shortening. The fold pattern well-defined by \n\nthe maximum curvature map is quite regular and sinuous (Figs 32a and 32b), with 1 km \n\nwavelength and 100 m amplitude (Fig. 32c). Fold axes are slightly rotated counter-\n\nclockwise in relation to the main NE-SW structural trend (Fig. 32a). The rhombohedral \n\nfolded area is interpreted as a transpressive structure related to left-lateral strike-slip \n\nreactivation of steep basement shear zones trending NE-SW (insert of Fig. 32a). As \n\npost-Aptian strata are not deformed, it is possible to place deformation at the Albian-\n\nCenomanian transition, still under the regional stress field of the rift phase with N-S \n\nmaximum horizontal stress (SHmax). This deformation phase is related to the end of \n\nextension, but there was not yet a rotation of the regional stress field. \n\n \n\n\n\n 87\n\n5.2. Albian-Cenomanian and Santonian Transpression \n\nThe second example of basement reactivation was observed in a 90 km2 area faulted \n\nand folded in northeastern Campos Basin (Fig. 33). Deformation of pre-Aptian \n\nsuccessions (up to 1200 m thick) is given by quite complex thrust-faulting and folding \n\n(Fig. 33c). Strata ranging in age from Albian to Turonian (up to 1000 m thick) were \n\nsubjected to more regular folding with 1km wavelength and 100 m amplitude. Fold axes \n\ntrending NE-SW show interference between Z and S sinuous patterns disposed en-\n\nechelon (Fig. 33a). Such geometry is interpreted as a result of transpression caused by \n\nstrike-slip reactivation of NNW-SSE basement fabric with right-lateral followed by left-\n\nlateral kinematics. The right-lateral Albian-Cenomanian transpression represents the \n\nend of regional E-W extension still related to a regional loading with N-S SHmax, as in \n\nthe example in Figure 31. The left-lateral Santonian kinematics is related to the rotation \n\nof the regional SHmax to E-W caused by the development of the South Atlantic mid-\n\noceanic spreading center. The structure was probably amplified by salt movement \n\nacross the section and by a buttress effect of the basement high (Fig. 33c). \n\nAnother example of transpression was observed in northwestern Campos Basin (Fig. \n\n34). In this case, strata ranging in age from Albian to Santonian were subjected to en-\n\nechelon folding. The folds with axes oriented N-S can be interpreted as a result of right-\n\nlateral strike-slip reactivation of the NE-SW basement fabric related to the already \n\nmentioned rotation of the regional SHmax to E-W. As the Maastrichtian strata are not \n\nfolded is possible to place this deformation phase at the Santonian. \n\n5.3. Paleogene Transpression and Transtension \n\nThe Paleogene example of basement reactivation (section D, Fig. 35) is contiguous \n\nto the folding area in section B at northeastern Campos Basin (Fig. 31). A large fold \n\nwith 3 km half-wavelength and 300 m amplitude affects up to 2700 m of Upper-\n\nCretaceous to Paleogene strata (Fig. 35). The structure is interpreted as a fault \n\npropagation fold (Suppe, 1985). The deformation is clearly episodic with well-\n\nconstrained pre-kinematic, sin-kinematic and post-kinematic phases (Fig. 35c). The \n\nmain deformation phase in the Eocene is indicated by onlap pattern and section growth \n\n(Fig. 35c). The fold was related to transpression associated with left-lateral reactivation \n\nof NW-SE basement fabric during the Paleogene under E-W maximum horizontal \n\nstress. The shortening associated with transpression caused the inversion of Lower \n\nAlbian listric normal faults (Fig. 35c). \n\n\n\n 88\n\nIn central Campos Basin, 80 km to the south of previous example of transpression, \n\nthe Paleogene reactivation event is characterized by normal faulting and section growth \n\n(Fig. 36). Most of the faults are restricted to Paleogene and older strata, and are \n\nconcentrated above a basement high (Fig. 36b). The faults are planar and discontinuous. \n\nThe fault system is characterized by a dispersed distribution of orientations around \n\nNNE-SSW (Fig. 36a and 36c). The structure is interpreted as a negative flower caused \n\nby transtension (Woodcock and Schubert, 1994). The observed dispersion of fault \n\norientations was probably caused by the coupling between stress fields related to both \n\nbasement reactivation and gravitational gliding above the Aptian salt detachment. \n\nThe tectonic and magmatic reactivation along the southeastern continental margin of \n\nBrazil during the Paleogene was already well documented (Chang et al., 1992; Scarton, \n\n1993; Almeida et al., 1996; Thompson et al., 1998; Cobbold et al., 2001; Thomaz Filho \n\net al., 2005; Zal\u00e1n and Oliveira, 2005). The Paleogene magmatic activity was \n\nparticularly intense in southern Campos Basin, where many volcanic structures have \n\nbeen described (Mizusaki and Mohriak, 1992; Figs. 32b and 32c). \n\n5.4. Neogene Transpression \n\nJust to the north of the previous Paleogene negative flower structure, still in central \n\nCampos Basin, the Neogene deformation is characterized by folding (Fig. 37). Observe \n\nthat the anticline trending NE-SW is positioned exactly above the basement high (Fig. \n\n37b). The structure is interpreted as an inversion fold that can be properly defined \n\naccording to both the clay models of Eisenstad and Withjack (1995), and the conceptual \n\nmodel of Sibson (1995). The inversion of listric normal faults related to gravitational \n\ngliding extension active from Cretaceous to Paleogene was caused by transpression at \n\nthe basement high during Neogene (Figs. 37c and 37d). \n\nAnother structure that indicates Neogene transpression was observed in northeastern \n\nCampos Basin, 50 km to the north of the previous inversion fold (section H, Fig. 31). \n\nThe structure is interpreted as an inverted grabben (Fig. 38). The grabben was formed \n\nby normal faulting during the Upper Cretaceous. The Cretaceous depocenter was \n\ninverted in the Neogene with the shortening caused by transpression related to the \n\nreactivation of the basement fabric (Fig. 38c). \n\n5.5. Overview of the structural analysis \n\nThe structural analysis of regional 3D seismic data indicates four periods of \n\nbasement reactivation during the divergent margin phase in Campos Basin (Table 3). \n\nThe timing of the Neogene and Paleogene deformation events is very well-constrained. \n\n\n\n 89\n\nThe kinematic interpretation and the involved strata indicate two phases of deformation \n\nduring the Cretaceous, but the timing of the basement reactivation has a certain degree \n\nof uncertainty.  \n\nExcept by the Paleogene tectonic event, which has a more widespread manifestation \n\nin Campos Basin, and along the southeastern coast of Brazil (Chang et al., 1992; Zal\u00e1n \n\nand Oliveira, 2005), the tectonic reactivation is selective and sparse, with open folds and \n\nmoderate fault inversion observed mainly above basement structural highs. The \n\nstructural style of the tectonic reactivation indicates an overall strike-slip kinematic \n\npattern. This overall picture of the reactivation of basement structures in Campos Basin \n\ninterpreted in the present work agrees with previously published observations (Scarton, \n\n1993; Pereira, 1994; Bruhn and Walker, 1995; Lima, 1999; Cobbold et al., 2001; Fetter \n\net al., 2002; Zal\u00e1n and Oliveira, 2005), as well as with the events indicated by apatite \n\nfission track analysis along the southeastern continental margin of Brazil (Gallagher and \n\nBrown, 1999; Saenz et al., 2003). Nevertheless, the structural analysis developed in the \n\npresent study allowed the definition of an accurate timetable for the tectonic events \n\ninvolving basement faults reactivation, with the indication of two deformation phases \n\nduring the Cretaceous, and of a further tectonic event in the Neogene (Table 3).    \n\n6. Major controls on deepwater sedimentation within Campos Basin \n\nThe quantitative petrographic analysis indicates that the sandstones deposited in \n\nCampos Basin deepwater during the divergent margin phase do not follow the \n\nincreasing maturity trend expected for tectonically passive margin basins. Actually, \n\nmost of the petrographic parameters of Campos Basin turbidites show a quite complex \n\nevolution pattern (Figs. 23 to 30). Particularly, the variation of the parameters grain size \n\nand quartz to feldspar ratio (Q/F) indicates an alternated deposition of two main types of \n\ndeepwater sandstones in Campos Basin (Fig. 25): (i) relatively mature turbidites with \n\nfine sand grain size and Q/F = 1.00, deposited in the Albian, Cenomanian, Oligocene \n\nand Miocene, internally characterized by well developed trend patterns (Figs. 9, 20, and \n\n22); (ii) immature turbidites with medium sand grain size and Q/F = 0.75, deposited in \n\nthe Santonian, Campanian, Maastrichtian, Paleocene and Eocene. \n\nTherefore it is clear that the evolution of the physiography of source terrains and \n\nbasin, and the formation of the deepwater sand-rich systems during the thermal \n\nsubsidence phase in Campos Basin was not exclusively controlled by the processes \n\nconventionally postulated for the evolution of divergent continental margins, namely the \n\n\n\n 90\n\neustatic sea-level changes (Posamentier et al., 1988; Galloway, 1989), and the passive \n\nescarpment retreat associated with the flexural unloading caused by the erosion of the \n\nrift-shoulder relief (Ollier, 1985; Gilchrist and Summerfield, 1990). This indicates that \n\nan integrated model of geodynamic and stratigraphic evolution must be developed in \n\norder to understand the controls on the deepwater sedimentation in Campos Basin. This \n\nmodel must encompass all the petrographic trends previously described. \n\n6.1. The exhumation of the Ribeira Orogenic Belt \n\nThe long-term evolution of the source-areas of Campos Basin can be envisaged by \n\nthe trend of decrease, of about one order of magnitude, in the contribution of micaceous \n\ngrains to the deepwater sandstones (dashed arrow in Fig. 30). This trend represents the \n\nincreasing exhumation of the Ribeira Belt. The average mica content has progressively \n\ndropped as the mica-bearing medium grade metamorphic rocks of the orogenic belt \n\nwere removed by uplift and erosion, exposing the mica-poor rocks of high metamorphic \n\ngrade. \n\nThis long-term signal is related to the escarpment retreat geodynamic model, defined \n\nby progressive erosion, unloading and flexural uplift along the basin margin. It is \n\nimportant to observe that most of the other petrographic parameters would have \n\nfollowed the same simple long-term trend if other geodynamic processes have not been \n\nactive during Campos Basin divergent margin phase. \n\n6.2. The mantle plume control \n\nThe Campos Basin was positioned along the trajectory of the rotational drift of the \n\nSouth-American plate above the Trindade mantle plume (Fig. 39). The influence of the \n\npassage of the basin above the plume on the texture and composition of the deepwater \n\nsystems is indicated by the nearly symmetric distribution of average grain size, Q/F and \n\nvolcanic rock fragments of the turbidites around the Maastrichtian, when the plume was \n\nbelow the Campos Basin border (Figs. 25 and 39). \n\nThe major control of the dynamic uplift caused by the thermal anomaly of the plume \n\non the compositional and textural character of the deepwater sandstones is indicated by \n\nthe dominant medium average grain size and low quartz to feldspar ratio from the \n\nSantonian to the Eocene (Figs. 23, 24 and 39). However it is important to observe that \n\nthe high content of volcanic rock fragments (VRF), which represents the magmatic \n\nactivity of the plume at the Campos Basin border, is manifested in a shorter time period, \n\nfrom the Campanian to the Paleocene (Figs. 26 and 39). \n\n\n\n 91\n\n6.3. The episodic tectonic control \n\nDetailed structural analysis of regional seismic 3D datasets indicated four major \n\ndeformation events of tectonic reactivation of Campos Basin basement fabric. \n\nQuantitative petrographic analysis of major sand-rich turbidite systems from Albian to \n\nMiocene confirmed that these tectonic events have indeed changed the physiographic \n\ncharacter of the source-basin system during the divergent margin phase in Campos \n\nBasin (Table 3; Fig. 40).  \n\nThe beginning of the divergent margin phase in Campos Basin during the Albian was \n\ncharacterized by the construction of a wide carbonate ramp, associated with tectonic \n\nstability and escarpment retreat of the rift-shoulder relief. Therefore, the Albian \n\nturbidite system is relatively mature with higher quartz to feldspar ratio (Q/F), and fine \n\nsand grain size (Figs. 23, 24, 25, and 40). With poorly developed slopes of essentially \n\ncarbonatic composition, the contribution of glaucony and mud intraclasts to the \n\ndeepwater systems were low (Figs. 28, 29, and 40).  \n\nThe first evidence of paleogeographic reorganization, related to the tectonic \n\nreactivation at the Albian-Cenomanian transition (Fig. 40), can be recognized by \n\nslightly lower Q/F ratio and larger average grain size (close to the limit of medium \n\nsand) of the Cenomanian deepwater sandstones (Figs. 23, 24, 25, and 40). Additionally, \n\na significant increase in mud intraclasts content is observed (Figs.28 and 40). These \n\npetrographic differences are well illustrated by the photomicrographs of the two \n\ndeepwater systems (Figs. 8 and 10). This increasing immaturity is interpreted in terms \n\nof a rejuvenation of the coastal relief, associated with partial degradation of the shelf, \n\nand with changes in the sedimentary pathways from the coast to deepwater. \n\nA more expressive paleogeographic change was caused by the Santonian tectonic \n\nevent. Comparing with the previous systems, the Santonian deepwater sandstones are \n\ncharacterized by a significant decrease in the Q/F ratio, and a considerable increase in \n\nthe grain size and in the content of mud intraclasts (Figs. 23, 24, 25, 28, and 40). The \n\nphotomicrographs in Figure 11 illustrate the textural and compositional immaturity of \n\nthe Santonian turbidites. Again the increasing immaturity is interpreted as consequence \n\nof the tectonic rejuvenation of the source-basin system. The glaucony contribution \n\nremained very low because of the further degradation of the shelf (Figs. 29 and 40).  \n\n Despite the relative tectonic quiescence from the Campanian to the Maastrichtian, \n\nthe Trindade mantle plume was sufficiently close to Campos Basin to cause volcanic \n\nactivity and dynamic uplift along the coast. Consequently, the deepwater systems \n\n\n\n 92\n\ndeposited during this period were also very immature, and particularly rich in volcanic \n\nrock fragments (Figs. 13, 14, 23, 24, 25, 26, and 40). There is a progressive decrease in \n\nthe average content of mud intraclasts from Santonian to Maastrichtian (Figs. 28 and \n\n40). This drop in the average content of intraclasts may be interpreted as a result of \n\nstable sedimentary supply routes to deep water through canyons deeply incised by \n\nrecurrent currents in the slope that were kept constant because of the tectonic \n\nquiescence during this period. Due to the absence of a stable shelf, there is virtually no \n\nglaucony contribution to deepwater (Figs. 29 and 40). The increase in the contribution \n\nof volcanic fragments and the decrease in the content of mud intraclasts in Campos \n\nBasin turbidites during Upper Cretaceous illustrate well two different types of \n\ngeodynamic impact along the continental margin (Fig. 40): (i) tectonic reactivation - \n\ncoastal elevation plus reorganization of the source-basin system in the Santonian, and \n\n(ii) effects of the mantle plume - coastal elevation by dynamic uplift and volcanism \n\nwithout major physiographic reorganization in the Maastrichtian. \n\nCampos Basin paleogeography was substantially changed again during the Paleocene \n\nowing to the beginning of the Paleogene basement reactivation. Additionally, with the \n\nend of the 2nd order transgression, a new shelf was built. The tectonic activity caused a \n\nrejuvenation of the coastal relief and a further reorganization of the source-basin \n\nsystem, still under the influence of the Trindade mantle plume. Consequently, the \n\nPaleocene deepwater sandstones remained very immature, with a significant \n\ncontribution of volcanic rock fragments (Figs. 15, 23, 24, 25, 26, and 40). A significant \n\nincrease in the mud intraclasts content was observed (Figs. 28 and 40), probably due to \n\nthe redefinition of the bottom current pathways caused by the physiographic \n\nreorganization. This interpretation is further supported by the increase in the glaucony \n\ncontent (Figs. 29 and 40). \n\n During Eocene the tectonic activity strengthened, and Campos Basin depocenters \n\nmoved above Trindade mantle plume. Therefore, Eocene turbidite systems are very \n\nimmature, with high mud intraclasts and glaucony contents (Fig. 40), as a consequence \n\nof coastal relief rejuvenation, and of the ongoing physiographic changes into the basin. \n\nOn the other hand, a considerable drop in the contribution of volcanic rock fragments is \n\nobserved, because the volcanic activity ceased along the coastal areas, being transferred \n\nto within the basin (Figs. 32b, 32c, and 40). \n\nDuring Lower Oligocene, with the end of the Paleogene tectonic reactivation and \n\nwithout the effects of Trindade plume, then already relatively far from Campos Basin, a \n\n\n\n 93\n\nsignificant increase in the maturity of the deepwater sandstones is observed (Figs. 25 \n\nand 40). The higher Q/F ratio and the fine sand grain size indicate a lowering of the \n\nrelief and a widening of the shelf. The small contribution of glaucony (Fig. 40) indicates \n\nthat the physiography and the sediment pathways along the shelf had been keeping \n\nstable. On the other hand, the relatively high content of mud intraclasts (Fig. 40) \n\nsuggests a situation of active physiographic changes on the slope, which were probably \n\nrelated to the ongoing progradation and to salt tectonic activity.  \n\nAs the mantle plume was very far, the Upper Oligocene tectonic quiescence allowed \n\nerosion and escarpment retreat along Campos Basin coast. In turn, the progradation \n\nrelated to the high sediment supply built a very wide shelf. This set of conditions caused \n\na further increase in the maturity of the deepwater sandstones (Figs. 25 and 40). The \n\ngrain size remained fine, and there was an expressive growth in the Q/F ratio (Fig. 40). \n\nThe physiographic stability of the source-basin system is confirmed by the low \n\ncontribution of glaucony and mud intraclasts (Fig. 40). As a consequence of the \n\nconstant sediments pathways through the shelf and the slope to the deepwater settings, \n\nonly minor contents of glaucony and intraclasts were taken by bottom currents to the \n\nUpper Oligocene deepwater sand-rich systems. \n\nWith the onset of the Neogene basement reactivation in the Miocene, the associated \n\nphysiographic reorganization caused a relative decrease in the maturity of the Miocene \n\nturbidites. The average grain size remained fine, but there was a significant drop in Q/F \n\nratio (Figs. 23, 24, and 40). There was an increase in the content of glaucony (Figs. 29 \n\nand 40), indicating shifting bottom currents trajectories along the shelf as a consequence \n\nof physiographic rejuvenation. On the other hand the content of mud intraclasts was \n\nrelatively low (Figs. 28 and 40), suggesting that the sediment pathways in the shelf-edge \n\nand the slope were almost the same of the Upper Oligocene. \n\n6.4. The downstream and the upstream control on the stratigraphic record \n\nSequence stratigraphy is undoubtedly the most powerful concept for the study of the \n\npatterns of sedimentary basins filling, particularly aiming at the prediction of reservoirs \n\ndistribution. Nevertheless, the approach of sequence stratigraphy is strictly valid only \n\nfor a well-defined set of boundary conditions.  \n\nThe ideal set of conditions for the application of the classic sequence stratigraphy \n\nmodel, recently defined as the downstream control on the stratigraphic record by \n\nCatuneanu (2006), is related to wide shelves in stable tectonic settings, without \n\nsignificant changes in the topographic gradients and in the sediment supply. Under these \n\n\n\n 94\n\nboundary conditions, relative sea-level changes will fully control the stratigraphic \n\nrecord, and systems tracts delimited by key stratigraphic surfaces will function as a \n\npredictive model for the pattern of basin filling. \n\nConversely, the boundary conditions may involve narrow shelves in active tectonic \n\nsettings with pronounced changes in topographic gradients and sediment supply caused \n\nby tectonic pulses, ice melting, anomalous rainfall cycles, and mantle plume effects. \n\nUnder these conditions, an upstream control on the stratigraphic record is established, \n\nand relative sea-level changes will not work so well as a predictive tool for basin filling \n\npattern (Catuneanu, 2006). \n\nFollowing this conceptual reasoning, it can be stated that the development of \n\nsignificant deepwater sand-rich systems is constrained by the type of stratigraphic \n\ncontrol. Under downstream control, sand supply to deepwater is enhanced in the late \n\nstage of relative sea-level fall, and large turbidite systems may be deposited in the distal \n\ndomain of the late forced-regression systems tract (Catuneanu, 2006). On the other \n\nhand, under upstream stratigraphic control, sand supply to deepwater can be enhanced \n\nby tectonic uplift or by river flooding caused by either ice melting, or episodic rainfall \n\npeaks. In this case important deepwater sand-rich systems may develop in any stage of \n\nrelative sea-level, depending on the paleogeography of the source-basin system (Kolla \n\nand Perlmutter, 1993; Burgess and Hovious, 1998; Zuffa et al., 2000; Carvajal and \n\nSteel, 2006). Therefore, the definition of the balance between downstream and upstream \n\nstratigraphic control is a fundamental requisite for reservoir prediction in basin analysis. \n\nThe evidence supplied by the petrographic analysis of the turbidite reservoirs and the \n\nstructural analysis of seismic data indicate that the deposition of sand-rich deep-water \n\nsystems occurred in Campos Basin under alternating downstream control and upstream \n\ncontrol, associated with tectonic reactivations of basement structures and with the \n\neffects of the Trindade mantle plume. The dominant type of control can be directly \n\nrelated to the two petrographic categories of deepwater sandstones defined in present \n\nwork (Fig. 25): the relatively mature systems (Albian, Cenomanian, Oligocene and \n\nMiocene) were deposited under prevailing downstream control, while the immature \n\nsystems (Santonian, Campanian, Maastrichtian, Paleocene, and Eocene) were formed \n\nunder prevailing upstream control. \n\n6.5. The high-order stratigraphic control \n\nThe biostratigraphic data in Campos Basin indicates that most of the deepwater \n\nsystems were deposited within short time spans of one single biozone that corresponds \n\n\n\n 95\n\nto intervals between 1 and 2 Ma (Antunes et al., 2004). Detailed cyclostratigraphic \n\nstudies indicate that the Upper Oligocene turbidite system was deposited during an even \n\nshorter time interval into the respective biozone (Perlmutter and Azambuja, 2005). \n\nAdditionally, it was previously observed that these deepwater sandstone successions \n\nwere formed by amalgamation of multiple events (Bruhn and Walker, 1995; Bruhn et \n\nal., 1998; Barroso et al., 2000; Perlmutter and Azambuja, 2005). The evidence of \n\nmultiple depositional events during time intervals around 1 Ma suggests that the sand \n\nsupply to deepwater settings in Campos Basin has been also controlled by high-order \n\nstratigraphic processes, possibly of climate nature.   \n\nThe internal organization of petrographic parameters observed in some Campos \n\nBasin deepwater systems confirms their amalgamated architecture. The Q/F ratio shows \n\nan internal high-frequency oscillation with constant grain size in the relatively mature \n\nAlbian and Upper Oligocene turbidite systems (Figs. 9 and 20). In the Albian system \n\nthe content of intrabasinal carbonate grains (CI) shows internal cyclicity parallel to the \n\nQ/F ratio (Fig. 9). These internal compositional oscillations are interpreted as a result of \n\nsupply alternation between predominant reworked shelf sediments (higher Q/F and CI), \n\nduring periods of normal rainfall, and first-cycle sediments from the upstream alluvial \n\nsystems (lower Q/F and CI), during episodic torrential rainfall events. \n\n7. Paleogeographic reconstruction \n\nCampos Basin was not subjected to major climate changes related to plate drift \n\nduring the divergent margin phase. The latitudes in Campos Basin have been restricted \n\nto a range between S20o and 30o, around the temperate-tropical climate boundary, from \n\nthe Albian to the present time (Ford and Golonka, 2003). \n\nDuring the Albian, at the onset of the divergent margin phase, a wide and shallow \n\ncarbonate ramp was developed in Campos Basin (Spadini et al., 1988). The relatively \n\nmature Upper Albian deepwater sand-rich system, characterized by high carbonate \n\nintrabasinal content (CI), was deposited beyond this ramp under stratigraphic \n\ndownstream control, probably during relative a 3rd order lowstand subjected to high-\n\nfrequency climate oscillations. \n\nThe Albian ramp was destructed in the Upper Cretaceous by drowning and by \n\ngravitational gliding above the salt detachment triggered by the ongoing basement \n\ntectonic reactivation. The Upper Cenomanian turbidites were deposited still under \n\ndownstream control, but are slightly more immature than the Albian turbidites, probably \n\n\n\n 96\n\nbecause of the initial degradation of the Albian ramp, and of some coastal uplift \n\nassociated with the tectonic reactivation phase at the Albian-Cenomanian transition. The \n\ndeepwater system was probably formed during a punctuated 3rd order lowstand during \n\nthe ongoing 2nd order transgression. With the proceeding transgression, and without \n\nfurther tectonic uplift of the source-areas, the formation of deepwater sand-rich systems \n\nwas subdued during Turonian and Coniacian. \n\nThe immature Santonian deepwater sand-rich system was formed under fully \n\nupstream stratigraphic control. At this time, Campos Basin was bordered by a very \n\nnarrow shelf. The coastal relief was actively uplifted by the Santonian tectonic \n\nreactivation phase, and the deepwater systems were fed by fan deltas or by short \n\nmountain rivers, similar to the equivalent environments already described in convergent \n\nmargin basins (Mutti et al., 1996). The Santonian turbidites can be defined as sin-\n\ntectonic, as the deformation was in course during their deposition (Bruhn and Walker, \n\n1995). The deposition of volcanic ash layers and the presence of significant amounts of \n\nburned palynomorfs in the Santonian fine-grained turbidites are related to the proximity \n\nof the Trindade mantle plume to Campos Basin (Caddah et al., 1998; Arai et al., 2005). \n\nThe formation of a new shelf was inhibited during Upper Cretaceous because of the \n\noverall transgression. Therefore, the Campanian and the Maastrichtian immature \n\ndeepwater sand-rich systems were deposited also under upstream stratigraphic control, \n\nwith a narrow shelf and high coastal relief. The significant contribution of volcanic rock \n\nfragments and the presence of burned wood fragments in the Maastrichtian coarse-\n\ngrained turbidites indicate the arrival of the Trindade mantle plume to basin margin \n\n(Figs. 14 and 39). The coastal relief was probably very high, uplifted both by the \n\ntectonic Santonian reactivation phase and by the dynamic uplift of the mantle plume. \n\nConsequently, the deepwater systems were fed by short mountain-rivers and fan deltas.  \n\nAfter the end of the 2nd order transgression in the Lower Paleocene, a new shelf \n\nbegins to form in Campos Basin, but still sufficiently narrow to allow an overall \n\nupstream control on the deposition of the immature Paleocene and the Eocene \n\ndeepwater sand-rich systems. The coastal relief was kept high by the Paleogene tectonic \n\nreactivation, and the deepwater systems were still fed by mountain-rivers and fan deltas.  \n\nAs the shelf was still narrow, the limited contribution of intrabasinal grains in the \n\nvery immature Middle Eocene turbidites, including soil and microbialite fragments \n\n(Figs. 16, 27, and 40), can be interpreted as the contribution from offshore highs located \n\nvery close to the deepwater depocenters, because these fragments would not resist long \n\n\n\n 97\n\ntransportation distances. These offshore islands were formed along the elevated footwall \n\nblocks of major fault systems activated during the Paleogene tectonic phase, under the \n\ninfluence of the dynamic uplift caused by the Trindade mantle plume that was then \n\nbeneath Campos Basin depocenter (Fig. 39). The Paleogene uplift of the Campos Basin \n\ndepocenter was previously documented by Scarton (1993). With the widening of the \n\nshelf during Upper Eocene, the intrabasinal contribution to deepwater systems was \n\nincreased significantly (Figs. 17 and 27).  \n\nAs the regression proceeded with the progradation driven by high sediment supply \n\nfrom the mountains formed during the Paleogene tectonic phase, a relatively wide shelf \n\nwas built in Campos Basin by the Lower Oligocene. The Lower Oligocene deepwater \n\nsand-rich system was deposited during a 3rd order lowstand, beyond a renewed shelf, \n\nand under downstream stratigraphic control (Souza Cruz, 1995). It is characterized by \n\nincreasing compositional and textural maturity, as compared with the Upper Cretaceous \n\nand Paleogene turbidites, owing to the feeding of deepwater systems by longer fluvial \n\nsystems and by sediment reworked on the widening shelf. \n\nWith further progradation during the Oligocene, Campos Basin shelf continued to \n\nwiden. The large Upper Oligocene deepwater system, which is the most mature \n\nturbidite system within Campos Basin, was also deposited during a 3rd order lowstand, \n\nunder downstream stratigraphic control (Souza Cruz, 1995). As for the Lower \n\nOligocene, the maturity of Upper Oligocene deepwater sandstones was probably related \n\nto both long transportation along an extensive fluvial system and sediment reworking on \n\nthe shelf. \n\nThe costal physiography was rebuilt by the new tectonic pulse occurred during the \n\nNeogene. The high sediment supply associated with the renewed relief produced a rapid \n\nprogradation front and a very wide shelf in Campos Basin (Figs. 2 and 3). The Lower \n\nMiocene turbidite system was also deposited during a 3rd order lowstand, under fully \n\ndownstream stratigraphic control (Souza Cruz, 1995), but with significantly higher \n\nfeldspar and glaucony content than the Upper Oligocene deepwater system, what is \n\nattributed to the rejuvenation of the relief caused by the Neogene tectonic reactivation. \n\nHowever the low content in mud intraclasts suggests that the sand supply to deepwater \n\nduring the Miocene used the same pathways incised into shelf edge and slope that were \n\npreviously used during Upper Oligocene. \n\n \n\n\n\n 98\n\n8. Discussion \n\nThe energy necessary to promote the process of turbiditic mass transportation may be \n\nderived from two types of systems (Normark and Piper, 1991; Mutti et al., 2003): (i) \n\npotential energy of coastal relief or shelf gradient plus kinetic energy of river flooding; \n\nand (ii) potential energy of delta-front gradient plus kinetic energy of delta-front failure. \n\nThe potential energy supplied by coastal relief is a product of geodynamic processes, \n\nwhile the potential energy of shelf and delta-front gradients is fundamentally related to \n\nstratigraphic processes. In turn, the kinetic energy of river flooding is a product of \n\nclimatic processes, either ice melt or rainfall flooding, while the kinetic energy of delta-\n\nfront failure can be released by tectonic activity and/or by slope instability. Therefore, \n\nthe recently proposed concept of downstream versus upstream control on the \n\nstratigraphic record (Catuneanu, 2006) can be applied to turbidite systems. Following \n\nthis concept, geodynamic driven relief, climate flooding events and tectonic activity are \n\nupstream controls, while shelf gradients, delta progradation rates, and delta-front \n\ninstabilities are downstream controls. \n\nA process-response relation was observed between the type of energy system and the \n\ncompositional and textural parameters of Campos Basin deepwater sand-rich systems \n\n(Table 4). The trends of average petrographic parameters and the overall \n\npaleogeographic evolution are well constrained by the major geodynamic and \n\nstratigraphic controls that were operating during the divergent margin phase of Campos \n\nBasin (Fig. 40; Table 4). \n\nThe geodynamic control is interpreted as a consequence of the interplay of three \n\nprocesses: (i) the passive escarpment retreat of the coastal relief, (ii) the dynamic uplift \n\nand the magmatic activity promoted by the Trindade mantle plume, and (iii) the \n\nepisodic tectonic reactivations of major basement structures (Fig. 40; Table 4). None of \n\nthese specific geodynamic controls alone can explain all the observed petrographic \n\ntrends. A purely tectonic drive fails to explain the formation of the large Maastrichtian \n\nturbidite system with massive contribution of volcanic rock fragments, which was \n\nundoubtedly related to the passage of the southeastern continental margin of Brazil \n\nabove the Trindade mantle plume (Fig. 39). However, it is important to observe that \n\nonly large plumes, generated at the core-mantle boundary with CFB magmatic affinity, \n\nreach the base of the crust generating dynamic uplift in areas around 2000 km2, with up \n\nto 1000 m elevations (Griffiths and Campbell, 1990). Small plumes with OIB magmatic \n\naffinity, as in the case of the Trindade plume, are generated into the mantle and tend to \n\n\n\n 99\n\narrive fast to the base of the crust, producing dynamic uplift in smaller areas, around \n\n300 km2, with lesser elevations (Griffiths and Campbell, 1990). In any case, the time \n\nspan of the dynamic uplift caused by the passage above a mantle plume is even shorter \n\nthan the exponential isostatic adjustment of the oceanic crust generated at mid-ocean \n\nridges (Condie, 2001). Therefore, it is not reasonable to credit all the evolution of the \n\ncoastal relief along Campos Basin border, indicated by turbidite petrography and \n\nstructural analysis, to the Trindade plume. Actually, the observed relief rejuvenations \n\nand paleogeographic reorganizations are episodic, and have been occurring during at \n\nleast 80 Ma (Figs. 39 and 40). It is suggested that episodic and repeated uplift of the \n\ncoastal mountain chain along southeastern  Brazilian margin (Serra do Mar) can be \n\nbetter explained by episodic tectonic reactivations of the major basement fabrics, \n\nprobably enhanced by the thermal anomaly related to the plume during the Cretaceous-\n\nPaleogene transition (Cobbold et al., 2001). During the periods of tectonic quiescence, \n\nand without the plume effects, escarpment retreat has been the dominant geodynamic \n\nprocess acting along the Campos Basin border (Fig. 40, Table 4). \n\nThe above discussed geodynamic processes have been exerting a strong control on \n\nthe stratigraphic record during the divergent margin phase in Campos Basin. The \n\nperiods of passive escarpment retreat of the continental margin have been characterized \n\nby downstream stratigraphic control, largely constrained by base level changes. \n\nTherefore it is supposed that the respective relatively mature deepwater systems have \n\nbeen formed during 3rd order lowstands. As it was formed beyond a carbonate ramp, \n\neven the Albian turbidite system fits this interpretation, because the stratigraphic \n\nresponse to base level changes of carbonate ramps and siliciclastic platforms is similar \n\n(Catuneanu, 2006) . On the other hand, during the periods of tectonic reactivation \n\nand/or mantle plume activity, the upstream stratigraphic control has been dominant. In \n\nthis case the immature deepwater systems could have been formed in any stage of the \n\neustatic sea level.   \n\nThe internal organization of the petrographic parameters, particularly Q/F ratio, grain \n\nsize and CI content, indicates that the relatively mature Campos Basin deepwater \n\nsandstones were formed by the amalgamation of multiple depositional events. The well-\n\ndefined petrographic oscillations observed in the mature turbidites formed beyond a \n\nwide platform, with moderate coastal relief, under downstream stratigraphic control, \n\nsuggest that the sand supply to deepwater settings has been controlled by high-\n\nfrequency climate changes of the Milankovitch band during 3rd order lowstands (Figs. 9, \n\n\n\n 100\n\n20, and 22; Table 4). Following this interpretation, the internal growing-upwards trends \n\nof Q/F ratio and CI with constant or fining-upwards grain size (Albian \u2013 Fig. 9; Upper \n\nOligocene \u2013 Fig. 20; Miocene \u2013 Fig. 22) are attributed to the rise of the base level at the \n\nend of 3rd order lowstands, with progressive restriction of the contribution of first-cycle \n\nsediments to deepwater settings.  \n\nIn the case of immature deepwater sandstones formed under upstream stratigraphic \n\ncontrol, the triggering of the turbidity currents was probably related to the association \n\nbetween the potential energy of the high coastal relief and by the kinetic energy of \n\nepisodic events of enhanced rainfall flooding of coastal alluvial systems (Table 4). In \n\nthe absence of a well developed shelf, immature, first-cycle alluvial and fluvial \n\nsediments were taken directly to deepwater settings during flooding events.  \n\n9. Conclusions \n\nTwo classes of deepwater sand-rich systems were defined in Campos Basin based on \n\nquantitative petrographic analysis (Fig. 25): (i) relatively mature turbidites, with \n\nalternating shelf-reworked and first-cycle contributions, and (ii) immature turbidites, \n\nwith predominant first-cycle contribution. The geodynamic evolution of the continental \n\nmargin has exerted the major control on the deposition of these deepwater systems. This \n\ncontrol is determined by the interaction of three geodynamic processes (Fig. 40; Table \n\n4): (i) escarpment retreat of the coastal relief, (ii) dynamic uplift and magmatic activity \n\nof the Trindade mantle plume, and (iii) tectonic reactivations of the major basement \n\nstructures \n\nThe relatively mature deepwater sandstones were deposited beyond wide shelves or \n\nshallow ramps, during periods of escarpment retreat, with low to moderate coastal \n\nrelief. Under such boundary conditions, the stratigraphic record was controlled by \n\ndownstream factors, namely the 3rd order eustatic variations in the sea level and climate \n\ncyclicity of the Milankovitch band. However, it is important to notice that, in presence \n\nof a wide shelf, the downstream control can prevail even during phases of active \n\ntectonism (e.g. Cenomanian and Miocene systems; Fig. 40, Table 4).  \n\nThe immature turbidite systems were formed during periods of high coastal relief \n\nand shelf degradation, caused by tectonic activity and by dynamic uplift. In such \n\nperiods, the upstream stratigraphic control has prevailed and the deepwater \n\nsedimentation had been triggered exclusively by episodic rainfall flooding (Fig. 40, \n\nTable 4).  \n\n\n\n 101\n\nThe two largest turbidite reservoir systems in Campos Basin are the Maastrichtian \n\nand the Upper Oligocene (black stars in Fig. 40). These systems were formed during \n\nperiods of tectonic quiescence, just before the onset of the subsequent tectonic \n\nreactivation. This observation indicates that giant deepwater sand-rich systems can be \n\nformed in divergent margins as a consequence of tectonic rejuvenation followed by \n\nstable configuration of the source-basin system, independently of the type of \n\nstratigraphic control. In this situation, huge sand volumes can accumulate until the \n\nsystem happen to be aborted by a new tectonic pulse. Conversely, relatively more \n\ndispersed deepwater systems were formed when the physiography was unstable because \n\nof ongoing tectonic activity. \n\nFrom a methodological point of view, the quantitative petrography of deepwater \n\nsandstones was revealed to be a powerful tool in the paleogeographic reconstruction of \n\ndivergent margin settings, as it was emphatically confirmed for convergent margins. \n\nParticularly, the grain size and the quartz to feldspar ratio are very sensitive to the \n\nrejuvenation of the coastal relief, while the contents of intrabasinal carbonate grains, \n\nglaucony, and mud intraclasts are indicative of the evolution of the shelf-slope \n\nphysiography. As the methodology is very simple, it can be easily applied in other \n\ndivergent margin basins. \n\n The integrated paleogeographic reconstruction presented in this work represents a \n\nsignificant change in the interpretation of the geodynamic and stratigraphic evolution of \n\nCampos Basin divergent margin phase. Particularly, the main controls on the formation \n\nof the Campos Basin giant turbidite reservoir systems were redefined as a complex \n\ninterplay of tectonic, magmatic, eustatic and climatic aspects, contrasting with the \n\nconventional, sequence-stratigraphic models previously interpreted for these systems. \n\nThis new approach will be of key importance to generate realistic models for the \n\nexploration of new turbidite reservoirs and for the optimized development of producing \n\nturbidite oilfields in such a world-class hydrocarbon province. \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nThe present work was developed as part of a doctorate research project at the \nGraduate Program in Geosciences of Rio Grande do Sul Federal University (UFRGS \u2013 \nPorto Alegre, Brazil), sponsored by Petrobras.

The Q/F trend shows a linear drop from 1.00 in the Albian and the \nCenomanian to 0.75 in the Upper Cretaceous and the Paleogene; then there is an \nexponential increase to 1.40 in the Upper Oligocene, and an equally strong drop to 0.90 \nin the Miocene. \n\nFigure 24 - Grain size trend of the main Campos Basin deepwater sand-rich systems. \nThe average grain size changed from fine sand during the Albian and Cenomanian, to \nmedium sand from Santonian to Upper Eocene, and returned to fine sand from Lower \nOligocene to Miocene. \n\nFigure 25 - Cross-plot between the petrographic parameters grain size and quartz to \nfeldspar ratio (Q/F) of the main Campos Basin turbidite reservoirs. Observe that two \ntypes of deepwater sand-rich systems can be defined by the compositional-textural \ncharacter: (i) mature, fine sand systems (average Q/F = 1.00), and (ii) immature, \nmedium sand systems (average Q/F = 0.75). \n\nFigure 26 - Average amounts of volcanic rock fragments (VRF) in the main Campos \nBasin deepwater sand-rich systems. VRF content shows a background around 1%, and a \npeak close to 9% in the Maastrichtian, with amounts above 3% in the Campanian and in \nthe Paleocene. \n\nFigure 27 - Average contribution of carbonate intrabasinal grains (CI) in the main \nCampos Basin deepwater sand-rich systems. The CI content shows strong oscillations, \nwith peaks in the Albian and Upper Eocene, and troughs around zero at the end of the \nCretaceous and during the Middle Eocene. CI contribution is around 5% in the \nCenomanian, the Paleocene, and the Oligocene turbidite systems; it grows slightly in \nthe Miocene (7.5%). \n\nFigure 28 - Average content of mud intraclasts in the main Campos Basin deepwater \nsand-rich systems. Mud intraclast contribution was very low during the Albian. There is \na step of average intraclast content around 10% from Cenomanian to Lower Oligocene. \nDuring the Upper Oligocene and the Miocene the intraclast contribution dropped to \naround 5%. \n\nFigure 29 - Average content of glaucony in the main Campos Basin turbidite reservoirs. \nThe background glaucony content is very low (below 0.5%), but there are significant \npeaks in the Paleocene, Upper Eocene and Miocene (above 2%). \n\nFigure 30 - Average content of micaceous grains in the main Campos Basin deepwater \nsand-rich systems. Observe the oscillation in the amount of micaceous grains between \n1% and 3%, and the overall trend of decrease (dashed arrow) from 3.5% in the Albian to \n0.5% in the Miocene. \n\nFigure 31 - Location of the seismic sections used in the structural analysis of basement \nreactivations (sections A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H).

(b) 3D perspective with seismic section and attribute map of Barremian \nhorizon. (c) Depth-converted seismic section (see the regional position of section A in \nFig. 31). Observe Lower-Cretaceous strata folded at Albian-Cenomanian transition. \nFold axes are indicated by darker high maximum curvature trends. The structure is \ninterpreted as a result of transpression related to left-lateral strike-slip reactivation of \nNE-SW basement fabric. SHmax is the maximum horizontal stress. Observe also the \nPaleogene volcanic structure. \n\nFigure 33 - (a) Dip map of Albian horizon and insert with kinematic interpretation. \nObserve mixed S and Z sinuous pattern of en-echelon fold axes at Albian strata. The \nstructure can be interpreted as a change from right-lateral to left-lateral reactivation of \nNNW-SSE basement fabric associated with rotation of regional loading stresses. (b) 3D \nperspective with seismic section and attribute map of Albian horizon. Observe that low \nDip values define very well the fold axes at Albian successions of the early divergent \nmargin phase. (c) Depth-converted seismic section (see the regional position of section \nB in Fig. 31). Observe that pre-Aptian strata of the rift phase are also faulted and folded. \nObserve possible buttress effect of the basement high. SHmax is the maximum \nhorizontal stress. \n\nFigure 34 - (a) Structural map of Albian horizon and insert with kinematic \ninterpretation. Observe the pattern of en-echelon fold axes at Albian strata. The \nstructure can be interpreted as a right-lateral reactivation of NE-SW basement fabric. (b) \n3D perspective with seismic section and structural map of Albian horizon. Observe \nfolding of Albian and Upper Cretaceous strata. (c) Depth-converted seismic section (see \nthe regional position of section C in Fig. 31). Observe that only pre-Maastrichtian strata \nare folded. SHmax is the maximum horizontal stress. \n\nFigure 35 - (a) Structural map of Santonian horizon showing an anticline trending NE-\nSW and plunging to NE. (b) 3D perspective of the anticline. (c) Depth-converted \nseismic section showing a large fold with 3 km half-wavelength, and around 300 m \namplitude (see the regional position of section D in Fig. 31). Up to 2700 m of Upper \nCretaceous and Paleogene strata were folded during the Eocene. The main deformation \nphase is indicated by onlap and section growth in the Eocene. The structure is \ninterpreted as a fault propagation fold associated with inversion of Albian listric normal \nfaults. Inversion was caused by transpression along NW-SE basement fabric at \nnortheastern Campos Basin. The structure is contiguous to the folded area of Figure 32. \n\nFigure 36 - (a) Semblance map of Maastrichtian horizon showing a NNE-SSW fault \nsystem. (b) Depth-converted seismic section of the fault system (see the regional \nposition of section E in Fig. 31). Observe fault activity and section growth during the \nPaleogene indicated by black bars. (c) Stereonet contour plot of the faults mapped in the \narea showing a quite dispersed distribution (188 fault poles). Faulting is interpreted as a \nnegative flower structure associated with transtension caused by reactivation of NE-SW \nbasement fabric. \n\nFigure 37 - (a) Structural map of Lower Miocene horizon showing an anticline trending \nNE-SW. (b) 3D perspective of the structure. (c) Depth-converted seismic sections \nshowing an inversion fold (see the regional position of sections F and G in Fig. 31). \nObserve that Paleogene depocenters (indicated by black bars) were inverted during \nNeogene. Fold axial plane is vertical and oriented at N40E. Folding was probably \ncaused by transpression related to reactivation of basement fabric at the observed \nstructural high. \n\n\n\n 112\n\nFigure 38 - (a) Structural map of Oligocene horizon showing an anticline trending N-S, \nand plunging to the north. (b) 3D perspective of the structure. (c) Depth-converted \nseismic section showing an inverted grabben (see the regional position of section H in \nFig. 31). Observe the constant isopach of the Paleogene, between Oligocene and \nMaastrichtian (pre-kinematic). The inversion of the Cretaceous depocenter in the \nNeogene is indicated by the sin-kinematic onlap pattern (dashed circle). The inversion \nwas probably caused by transpression related to reactivation of the basement highs. \n\nFigure 39 - Correlation between the drift of the South-American plate above the \nTrindade mantle plume and the evolution of the petrographic parameters of the \ndeepwater sandstones in Campos Basin. Observe that the passage of the Campos Basin \nabove the plume is associated with a consistent trend of increasing compositional and \ntextural immaturity with average lower quartz to feldspar ratio (Q/F) and coarser grain \nsize from the Santonian to the Eocene. Observe also that the average high contribution \nof volcanic rock fragments (VRF) corresponds to a shorter time interval from the \nCampanian to the Paleocene, when the plume was at the basin margin. \n\nFigure 40 - Correlation between the main petrographic parameters of the deepwater \nsandstones and the geodynamic processes during the divergent margin phase in Campos \nBasin. Plume effects include dynamic uplift and magmatism. Observe that the two \nmajor deepwater sand-rich systems in Campos Basin (Bruhn et al., 2003), indicated \nwith black stars, were formed at the end of periods of tectonic quiescence. \n\n\n\n 113\n\n \nWell Age Age (Ma BP) Core (m) Thin Sections \n\nWell 10 Miocene 16.5 110 10 \nWell 08/Well 09 Upper Oligocene 23.5 190 18 \n\nWell 07 Lower Oligocene 31 100 8 \nWell 06 Upper Eocene 41 20 6 \nWell 06 Middle Eocene 47 30 10 \nWell 06 Paleocene 58 50 8 \nWell 05 Maastrichtian 65 80 10 \nWell 04 Campanian 72 30 10 \nWell 03 Santonian 84 100 10 \nWell 02 Cenomanian 94 140 14 \nWell 01 Albian 98 140 17 \n\n  Total 990 121 \n\nTable 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nReservoir Q/F Grain Size  VRF (%) CI (%) Intracl (%) Glauc (%) Mica (%) \nMiocene 0.91 Fine sand 0.40 7.85 5.03 2.02 0.33 \n\nUpper Oligocene 1.40 Fine sand 1.29 3.87 4.66 0.17 0.35 \nLower Oligocene 0.82    Fine sand 0.08 5.65 11.10 0.06 1.21 \nUpper Eocene 0.71 Medium sand 0.72 18.15 9.74 4.80 2.94 \nMiddle Eocene 0.77 Medium sand 1.39 0.54 12.75 0.54 1.00 \n\nPaleocene 0.75 Medium sand 4.54 5.76 13.44 2.41 1.75 \nMaastrichtian 0.65 Medium sand 8.67 0.00 7.90 0.04 3.47 \nCampanian 0.69 Medium sand 3.10 0.30 11.46 0.00 3.23 \nSantonian 0.88 Medium sand 0.03 1.52 13.75 0.31 1.00 \n\nCenomanian 1.00 Fine sand 0.62 5.43 11.10 0.30 2.95 \nAlbian 1.02 Fine sand 0.78 13.42 0.82 0.12 3.53 \n\nTable 2 \n\n \n \n \n \n\nAge Structural Style Kinematics Position in the basin \n\nNeogene Inversion fold; inverted grabben \nTranspression or \n\ncompression Center; Northeastern \n\nPaleogene Fault-propagation fold; negative flower \nTranspression; \n\ntranstension Northeastern; Center \n\nSantonian Regular folds with sinuous axes Transpression Northeastern \n\nAlbian-Cenomanian Regular folds with sinuous axes Transpression South; Northeastern \n\nTable 3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n 114\n\nDeepwater \nsystem Petrography \n\nInternal \npattern \n\nGeodynamic \nControl \n\nStratigraphic \nControl Relief Shelf \n\nMiocene Relativ.
