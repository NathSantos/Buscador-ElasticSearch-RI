Em \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es controladas, avaliou-se a efici\u00eancia de Tecnossolos, elaborados com res\u00edduos \n\norg\u00e2nicos/inorg\u00e2nicos e de escombreiras, na melhoria da qualidade qu\u00edmica dos lixiviados \n\n(percola\u00e7\u00e3o e simulados), para minimizar a dispers\u00e3o dos contaminantes, e melhorar as \n\ncaracter\u00edsticas qu\u00edmicas e biol\u00f3gicas dos materiais para desenvolvimento de vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o.  \n\nIndependentemente das caracter\u00edsticas dos solos, ambas as esp\u00e9cies crescem sem sinais de \n\ntoxicidade ou defici\u00eancia nutricional apresentando caracter\u00edsticas ecofisiol\u00f3gicas adequadas para \n\nfitoestabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o. Nas duas esp\u00e9cies, o primeiro mecanismo de toler\u00e2ncia aos elementos \n\npotencialmente t\u00f3xicos (EPTs) do solo \u00e9 a sua acumula\u00e7\u00e3o na raiz e baixa transloca\u00e7\u00e3o para locais \n\nfotossinteticamente activos. As concentra\u00e7\u00f5es fitot\u00f3xicas de alguns elementos na parte a\u00e9rea do \n\nrosmaninho n\u00e3o afectaram a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de pigmentos e prote\u00ednas nem desencadearam \n\nmecanismos de toler\u00e2ncia, enzim\u00e1ticos e n\u00e3o enzim\u00e1ticos, relacionados com stresse oxidativo. Os \n\nprodutos derivados das plantas crescendo na \u00e1rea mineira apresentaram viabilidade econ\u00f3mica para \n\ndiferentes usos pois mant\u00eam a sua qualidade comparada com as de \u00e1reas controlo.  \n\nAs escombreiras ricas em sulfuretos lixiviaram solu\u00e7\u00f5es extremamente \u00e1cidas e com maiores \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00f5es de EPTs do que as escombreiras de gossan. A metodologia mais sustent\u00e1vel para a \n\nreabilita\u00e7\u00e3o de ambas as escombreiras da mina de S\u00e3o Domingos foi o desenvolvimento de um \n\nsistema que combina o isolamento natural dos materiais ricos em sulfuretos, com uma barreira de \n\nres\u00edduos carbonatados, e fitoestabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o com esteva e/ou rosmaninho dos Tecnossolos elaborados \n\ncom materiais de gossan e res\u00edduos org\u00e2nicos/inorg\u00e2nicos. \n\n \n\nPALAVRAS-CHAVE Fitoestabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o \u2022 Mina de S\u00e3o Domingos \u2022 Plantas aut\u00f3ctones \u2022 Res\u00edduos \n\nagro-industriais \u2022 Tecnossolos \n\n\n\n \n\niv \n\n \n\n\n\nAbstract \n\nv \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\n \n\nThe potential rehabilitation of sulfides-rich and gossan wastes from S\u00e3o Domingos mine using \n\norganic/inorganic residues and plant species with economic value, Cistus ladanifer (rockrose) and \n\nLavandula pedunculata (lavender) was studied in this work. The ecophysiological behaviour of both \n\nspecies under natural conditions and the quality of some plant-based products (lavender infusion and \n\nbioextracts of both species) were compared according to the soils characteristics where the plants \n\ngrow spontaneously. The efficiency of Technosols, composed of wastes (organic/inorganic and mine \n\nmaterials), under controlled conditions were evaluated in order to improve the chemical quality of the \n\nleachates (percolated and simulated) and, consequently, minimize the dispersion of the contaminants, \n\nas well as to improve chemical and biological characteristics of the materials for vegetation \n\ndevelopment. \n\nIndependently of soil characteristics, both species grow without signs of toxicity or nutritional \n\ndeficiency showing appropriate ecophysiological characteristics to their use in phytostabilisation. In \n\nboth species, the first mechanism of tolerance to potentially hazardous elements from soils is their \n\nstorage in the roots and low translocation to shoots (sites photosynthetically actives). The phytotoxic \n\nconcentrations of some elements in the lavender shoots did not affect concentrations of pigments and \n\nprotein and did not trigger mechanisms of tolerance, enzymatic and non-enzymatic, related to \n\noxidative stress. The products obtained from plants growing in the mining area and an \n\nuncontaminated place presented similar quality and, consequently, economic viability for different \n\nuses. \n\nSufide-rich wastes leached extremely acid solutions with higher concentrations of hazardous \n\nelements than leachates from gossan wastes. The more sustainable approach to the rehabilitation of \n\nboth mine wastes from S\u00e3o Domingos was the development of a system that combines the natural \n\nisolation of materials rich in sulfides, with a barrier composed of carbonated wastes, and \n\nphytostabilisation of Technosols done with gossan materials and organic/inorganic wastes using \n\nrockrose and/or lavender. \n\n \n\n \n\nKEYWORDS Phytostabilisation \u2022 S\u00e3o Domingos mining area \u2022 Autochthones plants \u2022 Agro-industrial \n\nresidues \u2022 Technosols \n\n\n\n \n\nvi \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nINTRODU\u00c7\u00c3O GERAL \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nIntrodu\u00e7\u00e3o geral \n\n3 \n\n \n\nA actividade mineira em Portugal, nomeadamente na Faixa Piritosa Ib\u00e9rica (FPI), \u00e9 antiga por\u00e9m, a \n\nmaioria das minas encontram-se, actualmente, abandonadas e constituem graves problemas \n\nambientais e de sa\u00fade p\u00fablica. A mina de S\u00e3o Domingos (SE de Portugal) \u00e9 uma das minas da FPI \n\nque apresenta elevada perigosidade ambiental. Esta, deve-se aos grandes volumes de escombreiras \n\nde diferentes tipos, muitas delas inst\u00e1veis, com granulometria variada, pH \u00e1cido e baixa fertilidade, \n\nbem como, elevadas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es totais de elementos potencialmente t\u00f3xicos (EPTs) que podem \n\nafectar a sa\u00fade humana ou a conserva\u00e7\u00e3o dos ecossistemas atrav\u00e9s de diferentes efeitos negativos \n\nsobre as \u00e1guas, solos e biota. Al\u00e9m disso, algumas das escombreiras possuem fases s\u00f3lidas \n\nreactivas, em especial sulfuretos polimet\u00e1licos, que ap\u00f3s oxida\u00e7\u00e3o geram drenagem \u00e1cida. Este \n\nlixiviado, para al\u00e9m de possuir contamina\u00e7\u00e3o multielementar, leva \u00e0 dissolu\u00e7\u00e3o de outras fases \n\ns\u00f3lidas promovendo assim a dispers\u00e3o de elementos potencialmente contaminantes para as \u00e1reas \n\nadjacentes (solos, sedimentos e \u00e1guas), os quais consequentemente afectam negativamente a \n\nsobreviv\u00eancia e/ou desenvolvimento da biodiversidade e as fun\u00e7\u00f5es ecol\u00f3gicas do ecossistema. \n\nAssim, o problema ambiental presente na mina de S\u00e3o Domingos e em muitas outras \u00e1reas mineiras \n\nda FPI relaciona-se n\u00e3o s\u00f3 com as caracter\u00edsticas extremas das escombreiras, mas tamb\u00e9m com a \n\npotencial gera\u00e7\u00e3o de drenagem \u00e1cida. \n\nEmbora nestas \u00e1reas coexistam diversos factores de stresse para as plantas, associados n\u00e3o s\u00f3 \u00e0 \n\nactividade mineira (elevadas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es totais de elementos qu\u00edmicos nos materiais, baixos \n\nvalores de pH e mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica), mas tamb\u00e9m \u00e0s condi\u00e7\u00f5es meteorol\u00f3gicas das zonas \n\nmediterr\u00e2neas (d\u00e9fice h\u00eddrico durante a maior parte do ano, elevada radia\u00e7\u00e3o solar e temperatura do \n\nar no ver\u00e3o), algumas escombreiras ou solos desenvolvidos sobre estes materiais s\u00e3o colonizadas \n\nnaturalmente por vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o espont\u00e2nea e pioneira. O desenvolvimento desta vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o tolerante \n\ncontribui para a g\u00e9nese de solos a partir dos materiais das escombreiras, e para a reabilita\u00e7\u00e3o natural \n\ndas \u00e1reas mineiras bem como, para a evolu\u00e7\u00e3o da sucess\u00e3o ecol\u00f3gica.  \n\nDas v\u00e1rias t\u00e9cnicas de reabilita\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental de \u00e1reas com contamina\u00e7\u00e3o multielementar, a \n\nfitoestabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 considerada a mais eficiente e sustent\u00e1vel. Contudo, o sucesso do \n\nestabelecimento de plantas, mesmo que tolerantes e aut\u00f3ctones, directamente nos solos a reabilitar e \n\na longo prazo pode ser um processo dif\u00edcil em condi\u00e7\u00f5es de clima \u00e1rido ou semi\u00e1rido. Assim, a \n\nimplementa\u00e7\u00e3o de um processo conjunto ou de processos independentes que melhorem as \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es de reac\u00e7\u00e3o do solo, a fertilidade, a reten\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua \u00fatil e a estabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o da estrutura do \n\nsolo, atrav\u00e9s da adi\u00e7\u00e3o de diferentes correctivos, pode acelerar a reabilita\u00e7\u00e3o atrav\u00e9s da \n\nfitoestabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nNo entanto, \u00e9 de salientar que a reabilita\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1reas mineiras abandonadas s\u00f3 ser\u00e1 considerada, \n\nnos dias de hoje, se incluir n\u00e3o s\u00f3 melhorias ambientais mas tamb\u00e9m uma abordagem econ\u00f3mica. \n\nAssim, tendo em conta que distintos res\u00edduos industriais ou agro-industriais n\u00e3o t\u00eam qualquer \n\nvaloriza\u00e7\u00e3o, acabando depositados em aterros ou dispostos clandestinamente no terreno, e ainda a \n\ndirectiva europeia 1999/31/EC relativa \u00e0 deposi\u00e7\u00e3o de res\u00edduos org\u00e2nicos em aterros, a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nres\u00edduos na reabilita\u00e7\u00e3o destas \u00e1reas \u00e9 a solu\u00e7\u00e3o mais sustent\u00e1vel. Al\u00e9m disso, a concep\u00e7\u00e3o de um \n\nTecnossolo derivado de diferentes res\u00edduos, elaborado com as caracter\u00edsticas adequadas \u00e0 solu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndos diferentes problemas que limitam ou retardam a reabilita\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental, em vez de uso de \n\n\n\nIntrodu\u00e7\u00e3o geral \n\n4 \n\n \n\nres\u00edduos independentes, pode assegurar ou melhorar a recupera\u00e7\u00e3o a m\u00e9dio-longo prazo dessas \n\n\u00e1reas degradadas. \u00c9 pois a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o do conceito de \u201cTecnossolo \u00e0 la carte e \u00e0 imagem dos solos \n\nnaturais\u201d que contribuir\u00e1 para a recupera\u00e7\u00e3o das \u00e1reas degradadas o que inclui a reutiliza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nsustent\u00e1vel de res\u00edduos. \n\nV\u00e1rias esp\u00e9cies de plantas e materiais org\u00e2nicos/inorg\u00e2nicos tem sido sugeridos para a \n\nfitoestabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de solos adjacentes \u00e0s \u00e1reas mineiras ou de solos desenvolvidos sobre \n\nescombreiras constitu\u00eddas por rochas encaixantes e/ou materiais contendo teores baixos de fases \n\ns\u00f3lidas geradoras de acidez. Contudo, n\u00e3o s\u00e3o conhecidas, a n\u00edvel nacional e internacional, solu\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nambientais de recupera\u00e7\u00e3o de escombreiras de gossan e, em particular, de escombreiras ricas em \n\nsulfuretos, estas \u00faltimas de granulometria grosseira. \n\nPortanto, devido \u00e0 complexidade das escombreiras/solos das \u00e1reas mineiras, principalmente nas \n\nricas em sulfuretos e em condi\u00e7\u00f5es mediterr\u00e2neas, torna-se essencial que os programas de \n\nreabilita\u00e7\u00e3o incluam uma an\u00e1lise qu\u00edmica multielementar das mesmas, bem como das suas \n\npropriedades f\u00edsico-qu\u00edmicas. \u00c9 ainda importante o estudo detalhado de esp\u00e9cies vegetais e res\u00edduos \n\n(agr\u00edcolas, industriais, entre outros) que existam nestas \u00e1reas. Esta informa\u00e7\u00e3o pode ser essencial \n\npara usar, gerir e reabilitar estes ambientes que correspondem a focos de contamina\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental. A \n\nescolha do Cistus ladanifer L. (nome comum: esteva) e Lavandula pedunculata (Mill.) Cav (nomes \n\ncomuns: lavandula, lavanda ou rosmaninho) deveu-se ao facto de serem esp\u00e9cies bem adaptadas \u00e0s \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es mediterr\u00e2neas, ocorrerem espontaneamente quer em \u00e1reas degradadas e contaminadas \n\nquer em \u00e1reas n\u00e3o-contaminadas e, al\u00e9m disso, possu\u00edrem valor econ\u00f3mico. \n\nO presente estudo teve como objectivo principal avaliar a potencialidade de reabilita\u00e7\u00e3o de dois \n\ntipos de escombreiras de \u00e1reas mineiras abandonadas, uma rica em sulfuretos e outra de materiais \n\nde gossan, com recurso a res\u00edduos org\u00e2nicos e inorg\u00e2nicos de baixo valor com vista ao \n\ndesenvolvimento das esp\u00e9cies C. ladanifer e L. pedunculata para a explora\u00e7\u00e3o de bioextractos \n\nvegetais. Deste modo, o trabalho teve como objectivos espec\u00edficos: \n\na. Avaliar a capacidade de absor\u00e7\u00e3o, acumula\u00e7\u00e3o e distribui\u00e7\u00e3o dos EPTs nas ra\u00edzes e parte \n\na\u00e9rea das plantas estudadas e sua influ\u00eancia nas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de nutrientes, face \u00e0s \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00f5es de elementos existentes nos materiais das escombreiras/solos; \n\nb. Comparar algumas respostas fisiol\u00f3gicas de L. pedunculata associadas ao stresse oxidativo e \n\nalguns componentes envolvidos nos mecanismos de toler\u00e2ncia em plantas crescendo em solos com \n\ndiferentes n\u00edveis de contamina\u00e7\u00e3o multielementar; \n\nc.

No Cap\u00edtulo 1 consta a revis\u00e3o bibliogr\u00e1fica sobre os \n\nprincipais conceitos cient\u00edficos utilizados neste trabalho e, nos cap\u00edtulos seguintes (Cap\u00edtulos 2?11) \n\nexp\u00f5em-se os resultados da investiga\u00e7\u00e3o realizada atrav\u00e9s de artigos cient\u00edficos. Os resultados est\u00e3o \n\nagrupados em tr\u00eas tem\u00e1ticas centrais: \n\ni)  Estudo do sistema escombreira/solo-planta em condi\u00e7\u00f5es naturais no qual se compara o \n\ncomportamento ecofisiol\u00f3gico das plantas de C. ladanifer e L. pedunculata face \u00e0s caracter\u00edsticas dos \n\nsubstratos onde estas se desenvolvem espontaneamente (Cap\u00edtulos 2?5); \n\nii) Estudo do sistema escombreira/solo-planta em condi\u00e7\u00f5es controladas onde se avalia a \n\nefici\u00eancia dos Tecnossolos, usando diferentes misturas de res\u00edduos resultantes da agro-ind\u00fastria e os \n\nmateriais dos dois tipos de escombreira em estudo (ricas em sulfuretos ou gossan), na melhoria da \n\nqualidade qu\u00edmica dos lixiviados (de percola\u00e7\u00e3o e simulados), de modo a minimizar a dispers\u00e3o dos \n\ncontaminantes (Cap\u00edtulos 6?8)  \n\niii) Estudo do sistema escombreira/solo-planta em condi\u00e7\u00f5es controladas onde se compara a \n\nefici\u00eancia dos Tecnossolos na melhoria das caracter\u00edsticas qu\u00edmicas e biol\u00f3gicas dos materiais de \n\nmodo a permitir o desenvolvimento de vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o espont\u00e2nea (Cap\u00edtulo 9?11). \n\nAssim, no Cap\u00edtulo 2 compara-se a variabilidade, ao n\u00edvel da acumula\u00e7\u00e3o e transloca\u00e7\u00e3o de EPTs \n\ne nutrientes (As, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb e Zn), de diferentes popula\u00e7\u00f5es de C. ladanifer \n\ncrescendo espontaneamente em v\u00e1rias \u00e1reas mineiras da FPI (Brancanes, Caveira, Chan\u00e7a, Lousal, \n\nNeves Corvo e S\u00e3o Domingos). \n\nNo Cap\u00edtulo 3 apresenta-se o potencial de C. ladanifer na fitoestabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de solos, desenvolvidos \n\nem diferentes substratos, que cont\u00eam elementos n\u00e3o essenciais (Al, Ag, Ba, Bi, Cd, Sb e Sr), alguns \n\ndeles pouco estudados. Para isto \u00e9 exposto o comportamento de tr\u00eas popula\u00e7\u00f5es de C. ladanifer \n\ncolhidas nas \u00e1reas mineiras de Caveira, Lousal e S\u00e3o Domingos (FPI) ao n\u00edvel da absor\u00e7\u00e3o, \n\nacumula\u00e7\u00e3o e transloca\u00e7\u00e3o dos elementos n\u00e3o essenciais e a influ\u00eancia destes nas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ndos nutrientes e elementos ben\u00e9ficos (Co, Na e Se). S\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m tecidas considera\u00e7\u00f5es sobre o uso \n\nda esteva em programas de fitoestabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nNo Cap\u00edtulo 4 avalia-se o comportamento do sistema solo-planta e as respostas fisiol\u00f3gicas de L. \n\npedunculata, crescendo em solos com contamina\u00e7\u00e3o multielementar (mina de S\u00e3o Domingos) e em \n\nsolos n\u00e3o contaminados, associadas ao stresse oxidativo e a v\u00e1rios componentes (enzim\u00e1ticos e n\u00e3o \n\n\n\nIntrodu\u00e7\u00e3o geral \n\n6 \n\n \n\nenzim\u00e1ticos) envolvidos em mecanismos ecofisiol\u00f3gicos de toler\u00e2ncia. Isto permitiu avaliar o potencial \n\ndesta esp\u00e9cie para fitoestabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nNo Cap\u00edtulo 5 comparou-se a qualidade de alguns produtos derivados de C. ladanifer e L. \n\npedunculata (ch\u00e1/infus\u00e3o de rosmaninho e bioextractos vegetais de ambas as esp\u00e9cies) face \u00e0s \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00f5es, nestas plantas, de EPTs para a sa\u00fade humana. \n\nNo Cap\u00edtulo 6 avaliam-se as mudan\u00e7as hidrogeoqu\u00edmicas e mineral\u00f3gicas, a m\u00e9dio prazo, face \u00e0 \n\naplica\u00e7\u00e3o de misturas de res\u00edduos org\u00e2nicos/inorg\u00e2nicos a materiais de escombreira ricos em \n\nsufuretos. Para isto \u00e9 apresentada a varia\u00e7\u00e3o temporal das caracter\u00edsticas dos lixiviados de \n\npercola\u00e7\u00e3o e dos materiais a diferentes profundidades. \n\nNo Cap\u00edtulo 7 apresenta-se a varia\u00e7\u00e3o multielementar de lixiviados simulados de Tecnossolos, \n\npreparados com materiais de gossan ou ricos em sulfuretos e misturas de res\u00edduos \n\norg\u00e2nicos/inorg\u00e2nicos, e o potencial risco ambiental dos mesmos, relativamente aos materiais de \n\nescombreira sem reabilitar, tendo em conta a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o dos EPTs lixiviados e a massa de \n\nescombreiras existente na mina de S\u00e3o Domingos. \n\nNo Cap\u00edtulo 8 avaliou-se a efici\u00eancia da sobreposi\u00e7\u00e3o de uma camada de gossan sobre materiais \n\nde escombreira rica em sulfuretos e dos Tecnossolos (estudados nos cap\u00edtulos anteriores), na \n\nmelhoria da reabilita\u00e7\u00e3o dos res\u00edduos mais perigosos ao n\u00edvel da actividade enzim\u00e1tica da \n\ncomunidade microbiana dos materiais, qualidade qu\u00edmica de lixiviados de percola\u00e7\u00e3o e germina\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde sementes de C. ladanifer. \n\nNo Cap\u00edtulo 9 exp\u00f5em-se a influ\u00eancia das taxas de aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de uma mistura de res\u00edduos \n\norg\u00e2nicos/inorg\u00e2nicos no Tecnossolo, contendo escombreira de gossan, na melhoria das \n\ncaracter\u00edsticas qu\u00edmicas e biol\u00f3gicas dos materiais e no crescimento de C. ladanifer. \n\nNo Cap\u00edtulo 10, que \u00e9 baseado nos dados dos cap\u00edtulos anteriores, apresenta-se uma reabilita\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ncombinada das escombreiras em estudo, atrav\u00e9s do isolamento natural da escombreira rica em \n\nsulfuretos, da fitoestabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o com esteva e rosmaninho e uso de Tecnossolos. \u00c9 de salientar que \n\nestes Tecnossolos foram elaborados com material de gossan colhido em outra escombreira, tamb\u00e9m \n\nda \u00e1rea de S\u00e3o Domingos mas que praticamente n\u00e3o apresentava rocha encaixante, e por isso \n\napresentando condi\u00e7\u00f5es mais extremas, e as misturas de res\u00edduos onde se obteve melhor \n\ndesenvolvimento das plantas de C. ladanifer. \n\nNo Cap\u00edtulo 11 pretendeu-se estudar o per\u00edodo p\u00f3s-reabilita\u00e7\u00e3o de um solo desenvolvido sob \n\nmateriais de gossan ap\u00f3s aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de pol\u00edmeros hidrof\u00edlicos de poliacrilato e crescimento de \n\nSpergularia purpurea (Pearson) G.

REVIS\u00c3O BIBLIOGR\u00c1FICA \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nActividade mineira \n\n9 \n\n \n\n1.1 ACTIVIDADE MINEIRA \n\n \n\nOs dep\u00f3sitos minerais, produto de um ou mais ciclos geoqu\u00edmicos, t\u00eam sido, desde tempos \n\nimemoriais, uma fonte econ\u00f3mica muito importante para o Homem. \n\nAo longo da hist\u00f3ria, a actividade mineira, quer desenvolvida a c\u00e9u aberto ou em lavra \n\nsubterr\u00e2nea, originou diferentes tipos de escombreiras resultantes da extrac\u00e7\u00e3o e processamento do \n\nmin\u00e9rio e seu encaixante e, ainda, a circula\u00e7\u00e3o de lixiviados enriquecidos em elementos \n\npotencialmente t\u00f3xicos (EPTs) para o meio (Matos e Martins, 2006; Wong, 2003). As escombreiras \n\nproduzidas s\u00e3o, usualmente, de grande volumetria, inst\u00e1veis, com granulometria variada, baixo valor \n\nde pH e fertilidade e elevadas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es totais de metais e metal\u00f3ides (Abreu e Magalh\u00e3es, \n\n2009; Freitas et al., 2004a; Matos e Martins, 2006; Wong, 2003). Al\u00e9m disso, as escombreiras com \n\ntextura grosseira apresentam baixa capacidade de reten\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua incrementando, ainda mais, o \n\nforte xerofitismo clim\u00e1tico, factor que condiciona a sobreviv\u00eancia das plantas durante a \u00e9poca seca. \n\nEstas caracter\u00edsticas conduzem \u00e0 modifica\u00e7\u00e3o das caracter\u00edsticas f\u00edsicas, qu\u00edmicas e biol\u00f3gicas dos \n\nsolos adjacentes \u00e0s \u00e1reas mineiras ou dos solos desenvolvidos sobre estes materiais que, \n\nconsequentemente, afectam a coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o e desenvolvimento da vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o. Neste sentido, a \n\ncamada superficial dos solos fica sujeita a um maior risco dos processos erosivos (Abreu e \n\nMagalh\u00e3es, 2009; Freitas et al., 2004a; Tordoff et al., 2000). \n\nDe um modo geral, este tipo de actividade e seu abandono podem induzir efeitos directos e \n\nindirectos no meio sendo que o clima, temperado a \u00e1rido/semi\u00e1rido, contribui para uma potencia\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndestes efeitos (Mendez e Maier, 2008). Como efeitos directos indicam-se a perda de solo e o \n\ndecr\u00e9scimo da biodiversidade espec\u00edfica ou funcional enquanto nos efeitos indirectos se inclui o \n\nimpacto paisag\u00edstico e a degrada\u00e7\u00e3o e contamina\u00e7\u00e3o dos solos, sedimentos, \u00e1guas e ar que, \n\nconsequentemente, conduzem \u00e0 ruptura das fun\u00e7\u00f5es ecol\u00f3gicas essenciais dos sistemas (Wong, \n\n2003). De facto, a toxicidade dos elementos qu\u00edmicos bem como a diminui\u00e7\u00e3o do pH como \n\nconsequ\u00eancia da natureza dos materiais de escombreiras pode afectar o n\u00famero, diversidade e a \n\nactividade da comunidade microbiana do solo inibindo os processos biogeoqu\u00edmicos (Hinojosa et al., \n\n2008; Wong, 2003). Dependendo dos elementos e da sua mobilidade, estes podem ser \n\nbioacumulados ao longo da cadeia alimentar determinando ainda consequ\u00eancias delet\u00e9rias nos \n\ndiferentes n\u00edveis tr\u00f3ficos. \n\nA explora\u00e7\u00e3o mineira de sulfuretos maci\u00e7os polimet\u00e1licos \u00e9 uma das que apresenta maiores \n\nproblemas ambientais. A exist\u00eancia de fases s\u00f3lidas reactivas, como s\u00e3o os sulfuretos, e a sua \n\ncont\u00ednua oxida\u00e7\u00e3o, qu\u00edmica e bioqu\u00edmica, conduz \u00e0 gera\u00e7\u00e3o de drenagem \u00e1cida de mina (AMD \u2013 acid \n\nmine drainage) a qual est\u00e1 enriquecida em sulfatos bem como EPTs (Abreu et al., 2010a; \u00c1lvarez-\n\nValero et al., 2009; Romero et al., 2010; Sanch\u00e9z-Espa\u00f1a, 2008; Sanch\u00e9z-Espa\u00f1a et al., 2005, 2006). \n\nSegundo os mesmos autores, a composi\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica da AMD \u00e9 extremamente vari\u00e1vel dependendo \n\ndo tipo de dep\u00f3sito e \u00e9poca do ano por\u00e9m, pode incluir EPTs como o As, Fe, Cu e Zn (Quadro 1). \n\nEm ambiente mediterr\u00e2neo e especialmente nos per\u00edodos secos de primavera e ver\u00e3o, \u00e9 usual a \n\nforma\u00e7\u00e3o de efloresc\u00eancias de sais sol\u00faveis \u00e0 superf\u00edcie ou nos poros dos materiais (ex. sulfatos de \n\nAl, Fe e Mg com diferentes n\u00edveis de hidrata\u00e7\u00e3o, como a epsomite [MgSO4\u20227H2O], a melanterite \n\n\n\nActividade mineira \n\n10 \n\n \n\n[FeSO4\u20227H2O], e a copiapite [Fe\n2+\n\nFe4\n3+\n\n(SO4)6(OH)2\u202220H2O]) devido \u00e0 evapora\u00e7\u00e3o da AMD nos poros \n\ndos materiais (Abreu et al., 2010a; \u00c1lvarez-Valero et al., 2008, 2009; Ferreira da Silva et al., 2015; \n\nSanch\u00e9z-Espa\u00f1a, 2008; Sanch\u00e9z-Espa\u00f1a et al., 2005; Valente e Gomes, 2009). Segundo estes \n\nautores, estes sais apresentam hidr\u00f3lise acidificante e funcionam como \u201cfontes de reten\u00e7\u00e3o\u201d de \n\nelementos qu\u00edmicos por\u00e9m, ap\u00f3s as primeiras chuvas, redissolvem-se enriquecendo \n\nsignificativamente a AMD com elementos alterando a sua composi\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nA AMD provoca tamb\u00e9m altera\u00e7\u00f5es no ecossistema envolvente devido ao seu pH ser \n\nfrequentemente baixo (&lt;3) contribuindo, em geral, para incrementar a dissolu\u00e7\u00e3o de fases s\u00f3lidas \n\ncontendo EPTs e tamb\u00e9m o seu transporte (Abreu et al., 2010a; Ferreira da Silva et al., 2013; \n\nRomero et al., 2010; Sanch\u00e9z-Espa\u00f1a, 2008). A \u00e1rea de dispers\u00e3o depende de outros factores, como \n\na hidrologia, a geomorfologia e o clima da \u00e1rea, e das caracter\u00edsticas dos elementos qu\u00edmicos \n\npodendo atingir dist\u00e2ncias consider\u00e1veis em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 origem (Bleeker et al., 2002). Uma dispers\u00e3o \n\nda contamina\u00e7\u00e3o, atrav\u00e9s das part\u00edculas finas de material de escombreira e da AMD, at\u00e9 2500 m a \n\njusante do local da mina foi referida por Romero et al.

Estende-se ao longo de 250 km, desde a Marateca (regi\u00e3o do Alentejo ? Portugal) at\u00e9 Sevilha \n\n(Espanha), sendo caracterizada pela exist\u00eancia de grandes dep\u00f3sitos de sulfuretos polimet\u00e1licos que \n\npodem atingir mais de 200 Tg, como \u00e9 o caso de Neves Corvo, Aljustrel e Rio Tinto (Barriga et al., \n\n1997; Matos e Martins, 2003, 2006; S\u00e1ez et al., 1999; Tornos, 2006). A actividade mineira nesta \u00e1rea \n\nest\u00e1 distribu\u00edda por mais de 80 minas, algumas delas com ind\u00edcios de explora\u00e7\u00e3o h\u00e1 mais de 5000 \n\nanos (ex. \u00e1rea mineira de Rio Tinto; Ortiz, 2003). Apesar do impacte ambiental de todas as \u00e1reas \n\nmineiras da FPI ser significativo, as da parte espanhola apresentam uma maior \u00e1rea afectada (Matos \n\ne Martins, 2006). \n\nNa parte portuguesa da FPI (FPIP) existem v\u00e1rias \u00e1reas mineiras nas quais a extrac\u00e7\u00e3o foi feita, \n\nprincipalmente, a partir do gossan e dos sulfuretos maci\u00e7os polimet\u00e1licos, no entanto actualmente \n\nquase na sua totalidade est\u00e3o abandonadas (Matos e Martins, 2006). Actualmente, Aljustrel e Neves \n\nCorvo s\u00e3o as \u00fanicas que est\u00e3o operacionais. \n\nA actividade extractiva nas explora\u00e7\u00f5es abandonadas da FPIP decorreu mais intensamente nos \n\ns\u00e9culos XIX e XX, sem quaisquer medidas de gest\u00e3o ambiental devido \u00e0 aus\u00eancia de legisla\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\nconsci\u00eancia ambiental, contudo o impacte no meio \u00e9 de longo prazo j\u00e1 que houve v\u00e1rios per\u00edodos \n\nintermitentes de explora\u00e7\u00e3o (Abreu et al., 2010a; Matos e Martins, 2006; Quental et al., 2002). O grau \n\nde perigosidade ambiental varia consoante a \u00e1rea mineira e tem em conta, principalmente, a tipologia \n\ndas mineraliza\u00e7\u00f5es, a volumetria das escombreiras e a sua estabilidade, e as concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de EPTs \n\nnos materiais das escombreiras bem como o impacte existente nos solos/sedimentos, na rede \n\nhidrogr\u00e1fica e na paisagem (Matos e Martins, 2006; Oliveira et al., 2002). \n\nNa mina de S\u00e3o Domingos (SE da FPI, concelho de M\u00e9rtola), a actividade mineira iniciou-se na \n\n\u00e9poca pr\u00e9-romana com a explora\u00e7\u00e3o de Ag, Au e Cu a partir do gossan, contudo no s\u00e9culo XIX a \n\nextrac\u00e7\u00e3o baseou-se principalmente no Cu e S dos sulfuretos maci\u00e7os, apesar de tamb\u00e9m ser \n\nexplorado Au, Pb e Zn tanto do gossan e como dos sulfuretos. J\u00e1 no s\u00e9culo XX e at\u00e9 1966, data de \n\nencerramento da mina, a evolu\u00e7\u00e3o da ind\u00fastria do \u00e1cido sulf\u00farico promoveu a extrac\u00e7\u00e3o do S a partir \n\nda pirite e o aumento da explora\u00e7\u00e3o de alguns min\u00e9rios (Quental et al., 2002). A actividade cessou \n\nprincipalmente por quest\u00f5es econ\u00f3micas e sociais, nomeadamente esgotamento do min\u00e9rio (Abreu et \n\nal., 2010a; Quental et al., 2002). \n\nApesar do dep\u00f3sito ser caracterizado de m\u00e9dio porte, a sua longa hist\u00f3ria de minera\u00e7\u00e3o contribuiu \n\npara a exist\u00eancia de diferentes res\u00edduos e um impacte ambiental que n\u00e3o se resume ao foco de \n\nexplora\u00e7\u00e3o mineira mas tamb\u00e9m, a uma vasta faixa que abrange cerca de 50 km\n2\n (Matos et al., 2006; \n\nQuental et al., 2002). Na \u00e1rea mineira de S\u00e3o Domingos, os diversos materiais de escombreira \n\nexpostos estimam-se em aproximadamente 32 Tg (Fig. 1) e resultaram da extrac\u00e7\u00e3o (gossan e rocha \n\nencaixante e dos sulfuretos maci\u00e7os) e do processamento do min\u00e9rio (aterros industriais, britados de \n\npirite, cinzas de fundi\u00e7\u00e3o, esc\u00f3rias modernas e romanas, \u00f3xidos de ferro e tanques de decanta\u00e7\u00e3o) e \n\napresentam concentra\u00e7\u00f5es totais de EPTs que podem ultrapassar 10 g/kg de As ou de Pb e 2 g/kg de \n\n\n\nFaixa Piritosa Ib\u00e9rica: \u00e1rea mineira de S\u00e3o Domingos \n\n14 \n\n \n\nSb, atingindo tamb\u00e9m o Cu, Cd e Zn 2,74 g/kg, 159 mg/kg e 8,9 g/kg, respectivamente (\u00c1lvarez-\n\nValero et al., 2008; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2008). Estes mesmos autores, tendo em conta a rela\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nmassa/volume e a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o total ou dispon\u00edvel (extra\u00edda com \u00e1cido ac\u00e9tico) dos EPTs das \n\nescombreiras, avaliaram a sua perigosidade categorizando-as segundo uma escala. Assim, tendo em \n\nconta que apenas a frac\u00e7\u00e3o dispon\u00edvel apresenta um real risco ambiental, P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al. (2008) \n\nclassificou o gossan e os britados de pirite como o quarto e quinto, respectivamente, tipos de \n\nres\u00edduos mais perigosos na mina de S\u00e3o Domingos. \n\n \n\nFig. 1 Mapeamento dos principais tipos de res\u00edduos da mina de S\u00e3o Domingos (Adaptado de \u00c1lvarez-Valero et \n\nal., 2008). \n\n\n\nFaixa Piritosa Ib\u00e9rica: \u00e1rea mineira de S\u00e3o Domingos \n\n15  \n\nOs solos das zonas adjacentes e desenvolvidos sobre materiais de escombreira apresentam \n\ntamb\u00e9m contamina\u00e7\u00e3o multielementar com elevadas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es totais de alguns elementos \n\nqu\u00edmicos (Quadro 2), os quais ultrapassam os valores m\u00e1ximos admiss\u00edveis para diferentes usos do \n\nsolo (CCME, 2007), mas com baixa disponibilidade dos mesmos (extra\u00edda com diferentes solu\u00e7\u00f5es) e \n\npH entre \u00e1cido a ligeiramente neutro (Abreu et al., 2008, 2012a,b; Alvarenga et al., 2012, 2014; \n\nGonz\u00e1lez-Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2011; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al, 2014; Santos et al., 2012). Al\u00e9m disso, \n\ndiferentes bioensaios mostraram que alguns solos tamb\u00e9m possuem um n\u00edvel de ecotoxicidade \n\nrelevante (Alvarenga et al., 2012).  \n\nNo entanto, o problema ambiental presente na \u00e1rea mineira de S\u00e3o Domingos, e em muitas outras \n\n\u00e1reas mineiras da FPI, relaciona-se n\u00e3o s\u00f3 com as caracter\u00edsticas extremas das escombreiras e dos \n\nsolos mas tamb\u00e9m com a potencial gera\u00e7\u00e3o de drenagem \u00e1cida (Abreu et al., 2010a; \u00c1lvarez-Valero \n\net al., 2008; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al, 2008; Quental et al., 2002).

A lixivia\u00e7\u00e3o das v\u00e1rias escombreiras, principalmente nas primeiras chuvas, conduz a um \n\nimpacte negativo na ribeira de S\u00e3o Domingos, afluente do rio Chan\u00e7a e que drena a \u00e1rea mineira \n\n(Matos e Martins, 2006). \n\nSegundo a classifica\u00e7\u00e3o da perigosidade ambiental em \u00e1reas mineiras da FPIP, a mina de S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos apresenta o n\u00edvel m\u00e1ximo (Matos e Martins, 2006) sendo evidente a necessidade de \n\nrecupera\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental da mesma. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nFaixa Piritosa Ib\u00e9rica: \u00e1rea mineira de S\u00e3o Domingos \n\n16 \n\n \n\nQuadro 2 Concentra\u00e7\u00f5es totais dos elementos qu\u00edmicos mais representativos em solos da mina de S\u00e3o Domingos (min \u2013 max ou m\u00e9dia \u00b1 DP). \n\n \n\nRefer\u00eancias \ng/kg mg/kg \n\nAs Pb Cu Cd Sb Zn \n\nAbreu et al., 2008 0,01 \u2013 11,6 0,02 \u2013 24,93 15,1 \u2013 989 \u2014 1,5 \u2013 2150 20 \u2013 1369 \n\nAbreu et al., 2012a 0,60 \u2013 2,00 1,94 \u2013 7,36 743 \u2013 1750 \u2014 \u2014 342 \u2013 1010 \n\nAbreu et al., 2012b 0,50 \u2013 3,03 1,94 \u2013 9,21 210 \u2013 1750 \u2014 69 \u2013 486 33 \u2013 1010 \n\nAlvarenga et al., 2012 0,96 \u2013 7,96 1,62 \u2013 26,98 202 \u2013 424 1,9 \u2013 3,4 98 \u2013 364 34 \u2013 168 \n\nAlvarenga et al., 2014 0,07 \u2013 1,85 0,27 \u2013 4,95 52,6 \u2013 239,0 \u2014 \u2014 141,4 \u2013 547,8 \n\nFreitas et al., 2004a 0,04 \u2013 1,29 0,23 \u201312,22 87 \u2013 1829 \u2014 \u2014 104 \u2013714 \n\nFreitas et al., 2009 0,45 \u2013 3,56 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 98 \u2013 1099 178 \u2013 4035 \n\nGonz\u00e1lez-Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2011 1,1 x 10\n-3\n\n \u2013 7,57 1,2 x 10\n-3\n\n \u2013 18,57 3,2 \u2013 687 \u2014 \u2014 1,9 \u2013 753 \n\nP\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2014 0,08 \u2013 6,89 0,17 \u2013 >10,00 1,1 \u2013 62,7 0,2 \u2013 12 5,3 \u2013 1461 33 \u2013 3261 \n\nQuental et al., 2002 0,03 \u2013 15,90 0,05 \u2013 32,17 7,64 \u2013 6207 0,15 \u2013 80,01 3,5 \u2013 5640 17,29 \u2013 14850 \n\nSantos et al., 2012 2,64 \u00b1 0,61 7,34 \u00b1 1,97 226 \u00b1 14 \u2014 \u2014 43 \u00b1 12 \n\nVMA 0,01 0,07 \u2013 0,60 63 \u2013 91 1,4 \u2013 22 20 \u2013 40 200 \u2013 360 \n\n\u00aaVMA: valor m\u00e1ximo admiss\u00edvel para diferentes usos do solo (agricultura, residencial, comercial/industrial) segundo directrizes da qualidade do solo canadense para a protec\u00e7\u00e3o do ambiente e \nda sa\u00fade humana (CCME, 2007) \n\n \n\n\n\nDisponibilidade dos elementos qu\u00edmicos e sua toxicidade \n \n\n17 \n\n \n\n1.3 DISPONIBILIDADE DOS ELEMENTOS QU\u00cdMICOS E SUA TOXICIDADE \n\n \n\nOs elementos qu\u00edmicos existentes no solo podem ter origem natural, devido \u00e0 meteoriza\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nrocha onde est\u00e3o presentes, ou estar associados \u00e0s actividades antr\u00f3picas, nomeadamente a \n\nactividade mineira.

De acordo com alguns autores (Feng et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2004), as esp\u00e9cies vegetais s\u00e3o \n\num factor importante a ter em conta. Al\u00e9m disso, a frac\u00e7\u00e3o dispon\u00edvel varia com a solu\u00e7\u00e3o aquosa \n\nextractante, elemento e as caracter\u00edsticas do solo n\u00e3o mostrando usualmente um padr\u00e3o regular \n\n(Adriano et al., 2004; Anjos et al., 2012; L\u00e1zaro et al., 2006; Meers et al., 2007; Kabata-Pendias 2004; \n\nSantos et al., 2012).  \n\nV\u00e1rios factores podem regular a disponibilidade dos elementos, nomeadamente f\u00edsicos (ex. \n\nconstitui\u00e7\u00e3o da frac\u00e7\u00e3o coloidal), qu\u00edmicos (ex. pH e condi\u00e7\u00f5es de oxi-redu\u00e7\u00e3o), biol\u00f3gicos (ex. \n\nactividade microbiana na \u00e1rea da rizosfera ou exsudados das ra\u00edzes) e a interac\u00e7\u00e3o entre os mesmos \n\n(Bolan et al., 2014; Ernst, 1996; Kabata-Pendias, 2004; Hinsinger et al., 2006) (Fig. 2). \n\n\n\nDisponibilidade dos elementos qu\u00edmicos e sua toxicidade \n \n\n18 \n\n \n\n[C+]/[A-]\n\n[L-]\n\npe\n\npH\n\nOC\n\nO2\n\nCO2\n\nH+/HCO3\n-\n\nC+/A-\nH2O\n\nReductor\n\nQuelante\n\nLigante\n\ndessor\u00e7\u00e3o\n\nadsor\u00e7\u00e3o\n\ndissolu\u00e7\u00e3o\n\nprecipita\u00e7\u00e3o\n\nreac\u00e7\u00e3o redox\n\nquelata\u00e7\u00e3o\n\ncomplexa\u00e7\u00e3o\n\nabsor\u00e7\u00e3o\n\nabsor\u00e7\u00e3o\n\nexcre\u00e7\u00e3o\n\ndispers\u00e3o\n\nexuda\u00e7\u00e3o\n\nrespira\u00e7\u00e3o\n\nrespira\u00e7\u00e3o\n\nRaiz da planta Solu\u00e7\u00e3o do solo Constituintes do solo\n\n \n\nFig. 2 Esquema de poss\u00edveis factores que influenciam a disponibilidade dos elementos qu\u00edmicos nos solos \n\n(Adaptado de Adriano et al., 2004). \n\n \n\nOs baixos valores de pH dos lixiviados ou dos materiais das \u00e1reas mineiras, especialmente as de \n\nsulfuretos, podem promover um aumento da disponibilidade dos elementos no meio (Dinelli e \n\nLombini, 1996; Hinojosa et al., 2008). \n\nPara certa gama de pH, a disponibilidade tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 dependente de outros par\u00e2metros \n\nnomeadamente da presen\u00e7a de oxi-hidr\u00f3xidos de ferro e mangan\u00eas. Estes compostos t\u00eam a \n\ncapacidade de adsorver os elementos, atrav\u00e9s da forma\u00e7\u00e3o de complexos de esfera interna, ou \n\noxidar directamente ou catalisar a oxida\u00e7\u00e3o de outros elementos (ex. Cr e As) conduzindo, deste \n\nmodo, a uma diminui\u00e7\u00e3o da disponibilidade dos elementos (Bolan et al., 2004; Dinelli e Lombini, 1996; \n\nMcBride, 1989). O poss\u00edvel papel dos oxi-hidr\u00f3xidos de ferro na reten\u00e7\u00e3o de ani\u00f5es, por exemplo o \n\nAs, \u00e9 indicado por v\u00e1rios autores (Bolan et al., 2014; Kabata-Pendias, 2011). \n\nO conte\u00fado de mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica pode tamb\u00e9m reduzir a disponibilidade dos elementos devido \u00e0 \n\npresen\u00e7a de grupos quelatantes, aumento da capacidade de troca cati\u00f3nica ou mudan\u00e7a do estado \n\nde oxida\u00e7\u00e3o de alguns elementos (Adriano, 2001; Kabata-Pendias, 2011; Tejada et al., 2008). De \n\nfacto, a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de diferentes res\u00edduos org\u00e2nicos (ex. composto de res\u00edduos s\u00f3lidos urbanos ? \n\nRSU, bioss\u00f3lido ou lamas de esta\u00e7\u00e3o de tratamento de \u00e1guas residuais ? ETAR) em solos \n\ncontaminados pode diminuir a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de elementos na frac\u00e7\u00e3o dispon\u00edvel, usualmente cati\u00f5es \n\n(P\u00e9rez-de-Mora et al., 2005). Contudo, \u00e9 de salientar que a extens\u00e3o da forma\u00e7\u00e3o dos complexos \n\norgano-met\u00e1licos depende de factores como a temperatura, tipo de mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica e concentra\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndos elementos na solu\u00e7\u00e3o do solo (Bolan et al., 2014). Neste contexto, Tejada et al. (2008) verificou \n\nque, apesar da adi\u00e7\u00e3o de alguns res\u00edduos org\u00e2nicos (composto de restos da cultura do algod\u00e3o - \n\ncrushed cotton gin, e estrume de galinha) a um solo contaminado artificialmente com doses \n\ncrescentes de Ni diminuir o efeito inibit\u00f3rio deste elemento na actividade enzim\u00e1tica e na biomassa \n\nmicrobiana, o ED50 (ecological dose: concentra\u00e7\u00e3o do elemento para a qual a actividade biol\u00f3gica \u00e9 \n\nreduzido 50 %) era maior no tratamento com o composto. Este facto parece relacionar-se ao maior \n\nconte\u00fado de \u00e1cidos h\u00famicos neste res\u00edduo e, consequentemente, maior capacidade de adsor\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nNi (comparativamente ao outro res\u00edduo que apresentava maior conte\u00fado de \u00e1cidos f\u00falvicos) (Tejada \n\net al., 2008). \u00c9 ainda de salientar que o aumento do conte\u00fado de carbono org\u00e2nico dissolvido (DOC) \n\n\n\nDisponibilidade dos elementos qu\u00edmicos e sua toxicidade \n \n\n19  \n\npode aumentar a disponibilidade do As e, durante o processo de mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o da mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica, \n\nos elementos podem ser libertados novamente para o meio (Bolan et al., 2014). \n\nA presen\u00e7a de plantas e de toda a comunidade microbiana associada \u00e0 rizosfera tamb\u00e9m pode \n\nafectar a disponibilidade dos elementos no meio. No entanto, esta influ\u00eancia m\u00fatua \u00e9 complexa e \n\npouco conhecida (Barcel\u00f3 e Poschenrieder, 2003). As plantas absorvem os i\u00f5es do solo mas tamb\u00e9m \n\npodem acidificar a solu\u00e7\u00e3o do solo na zona da rizosfera, atrav\u00e9s da exsuda\u00e7\u00e3o de i\u00f5es H\n+ \n\ne da \n\nrespira\u00e7\u00e3o das c\u00e9lulas deste \u00f3rg\u00e3o, o que, consequentemente, aumenta a disponibilidade dos \n\nelementos (Ali et al., 2013; Hinsinger et al., 2006). Por outro lado, tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o exsudados diferentes \n\ncompostos org\u00e2nicos de baixa massa molecular que aumentam ou diminuem a disponibilidade dos \n\nelementos devido a contribu\u00edrem para a dissolu\u00e7\u00e3o de algumas fases s\u00f3lidas ou funcionarem como \n\ncomplexantes (Bienfait et al., 1982; Hinsinger et al., 2006). De um modo geral, todas estas varia\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nao n\u00edvel da rizosfera permitem disponibilizar os nutrientes aquando de desequil\u00edbrio nutricional da \n\nplanta ou reduzir a disponibilidade de EPTs. \n\nAltera\u00e7\u00f5es na qualidade dos solos/escombreiras podem ser medidos atrav\u00e9s de diferentes \n\nindicadores associados aos processos e caracter\u00edsticas f\u00edsicas, qu\u00edmicas e biol\u00f3gicas dos mesmos \n\n(Ara\u00fajo et al., 2007; Mart\u00ednez-Salgado et al., 2010). A determina\u00e7\u00e3o dos elementos na frac\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndispon\u00edvel do meio (sol\u00favel + complexo de troca), atrav\u00e9s de uma extrac\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica, continua a ser o \n\nindicador chave na avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do potencial risco ambiental e de sa\u00fade humana ou da qualidade do \n\nsubstrato, especialmente para locais contaminados, mas esta pode variar como indicado \n\nanteriormente. Al\u00e9m disso, esta an\u00e1lise n\u00e3o \u00e9 suficiente para avaliar os efeitos ecotoxicol\u00f3gicos nos \n\norganismos e na sua actividade biol\u00f3gica pois, n\u00e3o considera as interac\u00e7\u00f5es entre contaminantes, o \n\nefeito da matriz e o biota. Logo, qualquer estrat\u00e9gia para avalia\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental tamb\u00e9m deve \n\nconsiderar a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de bioensaios (Abreu et al., 2014a; Alvarenga et al., 2008a,b, 2012; Adriano \n\net al., 2004; Garc\u00eda-Lorenzo et al, 2009; Rocha et al., 2011) que, preferencialmente, incluam \n\norganismos de diferentes n\u00edveis tr\u00f3ficos e compartimentos terrestres e aqu\u00e1ticos, e/ou indicadores de \n\nfuncionamento do solo (Hinojosa et al., 2008). \n\nTamb\u00e9m as enzimas do solo catalisam diferentes reac\u00e7\u00f5es bioqu\u00edmicas envolvidas nos processos \n\nde mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o e de ciclagem dos nutrientes, podendo a sua actividade ser afectada mais \n\nrapidamente pela contamina\u00e7\u00e3o ou mudan\u00e7as de gest\u00e3o do solo que outras caracter\u00edsticas qu\u00edmicas \n\ndos materiais (Ara\u00fajo et al., 2007; Bandick e Dick, 1999; Belyaeva et al., 2005; de Varennes et al., \n\n2009; Martinez-Salgado et al., 2010). V\u00e1rios trabalhos mostram os r\u00e1pidos efeitos delet\u00e9rios dos \n\nelementos qu\u00edmicos sobre as actividades enzim\u00e1ticas do solo ap\u00f3s contamina\u00e7\u00e3o artificial de solos \n\ncom solu\u00e7\u00f5es padr\u00e3o (Belyaeva et al., 2005; Tejada et al., 2008) ou por res\u00edduos de mina (Hinojosa et \n\nal., 2008; P\u00e9rez-de-Mora et al., 2005). Por outro lado, apesar das varia\u00e7\u00f5es sazonais normais da \n\ncomunidade microbiana do solo, v\u00e1rios autores (Hinojosa et al., 2008; P\u00e9rez-de-Mora et al., 2005; de \n\nVarennes et al., 2010) avaliam a reabilita\u00e7\u00e3o de solos contaminados ap\u00f3s aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de correctivos \n\norg\u00e2nicos atrav\u00e9s da actividade enzim\u00e1tica.  \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n\n \n\n\n\nConcentra\u00e7\u00e3o dos elementos qu\u00edmicos nas plantas e respostas ecofisiol\u00f3gicas \n\n21 \n\n \n\n1.4 CONCENTRA\u00c7\u00c3O DOS ELEMENTOS QU\u00cdMICOS NAS PLANTAS E RESPOSTAS \n\nECOFISIOL\u00d3GICAS \n\n \n\nA composi\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica das plantas \u00e9 a resposta a um conjunto de par\u00e2metros, designadamente a \n\ndisponibilidade dos elementos no solo (associados \u00e0 frac\u00e7\u00e3o sol\u00favel e ao complexo de troca) ou a \n\ndeposi\u00e7\u00e3o atmosf\u00e9rica, e pela capacidade de absorver e transferir os mesmos elementos para as \n\ndiferentes partes da planta atrav\u00e9s dos seus vasos condutores (Kabata-Pendias, 2011). Assim, a \n\ncomposi\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica das plantas nem sempre reflecte as concentra\u00e7\u00f5es dos elementos no meio, \n\nnomeadamente concentra\u00e7\u00f5es totais ou dispon\u00edveis dos elementos no solo. De facto, a absor\u00e7\u00e3o, \n\ntransloca\u00e7\u00e3o e acumula\u00e7\u00e3o dos elementos nas plantas pode variar com a esp\u00e9cie, ec\u00f3tipo, \n\npopula\u00e7\u00e3o, idade da planta (ou fase de crescimento) e elemento em quest\u00e3o (Abreu et al., 2012a,b; \n\nConesa et al., 2006; Freitas et al., 2004a,b, 2009; Gonz\u00e1lez-Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2011; Kabata-Pendias, \n\n2011; Kidd et al., 2004; L\u00e1zaro et al., 2006; Santos et al., 2012). \u00c9 de salientar que algumas \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es meterol\u00f3gicas (ou sazonais) tamb\u00e9m afectam estes mecanismos, tais como o regime \n\nh\u00eddrico e a temperatura do ar, e desequilibrios nutricionais (Kabata-Pendias, 2011), nomeadamente \n\nas que ocorrem em \u00e1reas \u00e1ridas e semi\u00e1ridas. Por outro lado, as plantas desenvolveram durante a \n\nsua evolu\u00e7\u00e3o v\u00e1rios mecanismos que resultaram na adapta\u00e7\u00e3o e toler\u00e2ncia a novos meios ou a \n\nmeios quimicamente desequilibrados (ex. nutricionalmente ou pela contamina\u00e7\u00e3o) (Kabata Pendias, \n\n2004, 2011). \n\nDo ponto de vista biol\u00f3gico, os elementos podem categorizar-se em dois grandes grupos segundo \n\nas fun\u00e7\u00f5es que exercem no metabolismo: os nutrientes (ou elementos essenciais) e os elementos \n\nn\u00e3o essenciais (ou potencialmente t\u00f3xicos) (Adriano, 2001). Apesar dos mecanismos de absor\u00e7\u00e3o \n\npelas ra\u00edzes poderem ser regulados pela selec\u00e7\u00e3o biol\u00f3gica dos elementos, estes processos podem \n\nser limitados perante o elemento (Kabata-Pendias, 2011). Assim, a raiz pode actuar como barreira \n\nimpedindo a passagem de alguns elementos, contudo outros elementos n\u00e3o-essenciais, devido a \n\npossu\u00edrem o mesmo estado de val\u00eancia ou raio i\u00f3nico semelhante, podem competir efectivamente e \n\nentrar nas ra\u00edzes pelos mesmos transportadores transmembranares (Ghosh e Singh, 2005; Hodson, \n\n2012; Kabata-Pendias, 2011). De facto, \u00e9 conhecido que, por exemplo, o As(V) funciona como um \n\nan\u00e1logo do P sendo absorvido pelas plantas atrav\u00e9s do sistema transportador do P (Bolan et al., \n\n2014; Hodson, 2012). \n\nAp\u00f3s a absor\u00e7\u00e3o, os nutrientes s\u00e3o usualmente translocados para a parte a\u00e9rea, onde s\u00e3o \n\ninclu\u00eddos nas diferentes vias metab\u00f3licas, enquanto que os elementos n\u00e3o essenciais s\u00e3o retidos nas \n\nra\u00edzes contudo, em alguns casos pode-se observar o contr\u00e1rio. V\u00e1rios trabalhos mostram esta \n\nvariabilidade intra e inter-espec\u00edfica nos comportamentos de absor\u00e7\u00e3o e transloca\u00e7\u00e3o face \u00e0 \n\nimport\u00e2ncia metab\u00f3lica dos elementos (Abreu et al., 2012b; Alvarenga et al., 2004; de la Fuente et al., \n\n2010; Kidd et al., 2004; Trigueros et al., 2012). \n\nAo n\u00edvel da acumula\u00e7\u00e3o nos tecidos fotossinteticamente activos os elementos essenciais, \n\nnomeadamente os micronutrientes, podem tamb\u00e9m ser t\u00f3xicos quando a sua concentra\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nultrapassa a gama de toler\u00e2ncia. Este intervalo de concentra\u00e7\u00e3o difere com a esp\u00e9cie, elemento ou \n\n\n\nConcentra\u00e7\u00e3o dos elementos qu\u00edmicos nas plantas e respostas ecofisiol\u00f3gicas \n\n22 \n\n \n\nmesmo estado de oxida\u00e7\u00e3o (Kabata-Pendias, 2011), sendo a gama de toler\u00e2ncia considerada como a \n\ngama de concentra\u00e7\u00e3o para a qual o crescimento e desenvolvimento de determinada esp\u00e9cie s\u00e3o \n\nm\u00e1ximos. \n\nEm condi\u00e7\u00f5es de stresse, como \u00e9 toxicidade por metais/metal\u00f3ides, v\u00e1rios processos podem ser \n\nafectados devido a um aumento da produ\u00e7\u00e3o de esp\u00e9cies reactivas de oxig\u00e9nio (ROS \u2013 reactive \n\noxigen species) e sua acumula\u00e7\u00e3o nas c\u00e9lulas. A amplitude da resposta depende da intensidade e \n\ntempo de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o ao elemento, formas qu\u00edmicas existentes no solo e esp\u00e9cie da planta (Bourrelier \n\net al., 1998). \n\nA redu\u00e7\u00e3o do crescimento (ex. comprimento e biomassa da parte a\u00e9rea) e o aparecimento de \n\ncloroses ou necroses s\u00e3o alguns dos efeitos visuais de toxicidade referenciados (Adriano, 2001; Cao \n\net al., 2004; Kabata-Pendias, 2011; Nadg\u00f3rska-Socha et al., 2013). No entanto, em algumas esp\u00e9cies \n\n(ex. Erica andevalensis; Cistus ladanifer; Nerium oleander L.) podem n\u00e3o ser evidentes os sinais \n\nvisuais de toxicidade, apesar de estarem a ser afectados negativamente alguns processos fisiol\u00f3gicos \n\n(ex. altera\u00e7\u00e3o do teor de \u00e1gua, diminui\u00e7\u00e3o dos conte\u00fados em clorofilas, desequil\u00edbrio da composi\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nelementar) pelos ROS produzidos pelo excesso de elementos acumulados nos tecidos (Kidd et al., \n\n2004; Mingorance et al., 2012; Santos et al., 2013; Trigueros et al., 2012). Os ROS s\u00e3o compostos \n\naltamente oxidantes que provocam danos significativos ao n\u00edvel fisiol\u00f3gico e celular (ex. processos de \n\ntransporte, fotoss\u00edntese, estrutura das membranas, peroxida\u00e7\u00e3o lip\u00eddica ou desnatura\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nprote\u00ednas) (Zitka et al., 2013). \n\nQuando uma planta est\u00e1 sob stresse, face a concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de elementos acima da sua gama de \n\n\u00f3ptimo, podem desencadear-se uma s\u00e9rie de mecanismos de toler\u00e2ncia (Abreu et al., 2014). Al\u00e9m \n\ndisso, os elementos qu\u00edmicos acumulados na planta podem conduzir a uma s\u00e9rie de efeitos de \n\nantagonismo e sinergismo (Kabata-Pendias, 2011). A toler\u00e2ncia pode desencadear-se por estrat\u00e9gias \n\nde exclus\u00e3o, desintoxica\u00e7\u00e3o ou toler\u00e2ncia bioqu\u00edmica (Baker, 1981; Baker e Walker, 1990; Barcel\u00f3 e \n\nPoschenrieder, 2003; Levitt, 1980). Segundo estes autores, a estrat\u00e9gia de exclus\u00e3o \u00e9 caracterizada \n\ncomo a restri\u00e7\u00e3o da absor\u00e7\u00e3o dos elementos atrav\u00e9s da exsuda\u00e7\u00e3o de compostos org\u00e2nicos, \n\nlimita\u00e7\u00e3o da sua transloca\u00e7\u00e3o para a parte a\u00e9rea e locais fotossinteticamente activos, e/ou \n\nacumula\u00e7\u00e3o dos elementos nas folhas mais velhas que senescem e depois caem. Ao n\u00edvel da raiz, os \n\nelementos qu\u00edmicos podem ser acumulados no interior ou sobre a superf\u00edcie das ra\u00edzes sendo o \n\nplasmalema a primeira barreira para a selec\u00e7\u00e3o e o controlo da absor\u00e7\u00e3o (Adriano, 2001). Sharma \n\nand Dubey (2005) referiram que, em alguns casos, a reten\u00e7\u00e3o de Pb nas ra\u00edzes \u00e9 baseado na sua \n\nprecipita\u00e7\u00e3o extracelular sob a forma de fosfatos e carbonatos de Pb, acumulados nas paredes \n\ncelulares, e devido \u00e0 sua liga\u00e7\u00e3o em s\u00edtios permut\u00e1veis sobre as c\u00e9lulas. V\u00e1rios estudos realizados \n\ncom plantas crescendo em \u00e1reas mineiras ou em hidroponia com concentra\u00e7\u00f5es crescentes de EPTs \n\nmostraram uma limita\u00e7\u00e3o da transloca\u00e7\u00e3o dos elementos devido \u00e0 reten\u00e7\u00e3o dos mesmos \n\nprincipalmente na raiz (Kidd et al., 2004; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2014; Rossini Oliva et al., 2009; \n\nSantib\u00e1\u00f1ez et al., 2008; Santos et al., 2009; Trigueros et al., 2012). Por outro lado, a acumula\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nprogressiva de As, Pb e Zn com o desenvolvimento das folhas de C. ladanifer ou de As e W em \n\nfolhas de Pinus pinaster Aiton, crescendo em \u00e1reas mineiras, leva a que as folhas senescentes \n\ntenham as maiores concentra\u00e7\u00f5es (Favas et al., 2014; Santos et al., 2013). \n\n\n\nConcentra\u00e7\u00e3o dos elementos qu\u00edmicos nas plantas e respostas ecofisiol\u00f3gicas \n\n23 \n \n\n \n\nA quelata\u00e7\u00e3o dos elementos na parede celular ou no citoplasma e compartimenta\u00e7\u00e3o dos mesmos \n\nno vac\u00faolo, principalmente da parte a\u00e9rea, funcionam como mecanismos de desintoxica\u00e7\u00e3o e de \n\nredu\u00e7\u00e3o da disponibilidade dos mesmos nos processos metab\u00f3licos essenciais (Barcel\u00f3 e \n\nPoschenrieder, 2003). A localiza\u00e7\u00e3o de Pb e Fe maioritariamente na raiz de E. andevalensis confirma \n\nque a imobiliza\u00e7\u00e3o ao n\u00edvel deste \u00f3rg\u00e3o, nomeadamente em alguns tecidos (Pb: tecidos da epiderme \n\nda raiz; Fe: parede celular da epiderme da raiz), funciona como principal mecanismo de toler\u00e2ncia \n\npara que as vias metab\u00f3licas sens\u00edveis da parte a\u00e9rea n\u00e3o sejam afectadas (Mingorance et al., 2012; \n\nRossini Oliva et al., 2009). Ainda para a mesma esp\u00e9cie, Trigueros et al. (2012) observou uma maior \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o de Cu e Pb na casca da raiz que na parte interior (cortex e sistema vascular) do mesmo \n\n\u00f3rg\u00e3o. \n\nPor \u00faltimo, a toler\u00e2ncia bioqu\u00edmica \u00e9 assinalada pela presen\u00e7a de vias metab\u00f3licas especializadas \n\nrelacionadas com a s\u00edntese ou estimula\u00e7\u00e3o de componentes enzim\u00e1ticos e n\u00e3o-enzim\u00e1ticos que \n\nremovem e/ou neutralizar os ROS (Abreu et al., 2014b). A estimula\u00e7\u00e3o da actividade de diferentes \n\nenzimas (cat\u00e1lase ? CAT, super\u00f3xido dismutase \u2013 SOD, peroxidase \u2013 POD) como resposta ao \n\nstresse oxidativo provocado pela acumula\u00e7\u00e3o de concentra\u00e7\u00f5es elevadas de EPTs, em plantas \n\ncrescendo naturalmente em \u00e1reas mineiras ou em ensaios com solos contaminados, \u00e9 referenciado \n\npor v\u00e1rios autores (Cao et al., 2004; M\u00e1rquez-Garc\u00eda e C\u00f3rdoba, 2009; Nadg\u00f3rska-Socha et al., 2013; \n\nPang et al., 2003; Santos et al., 2009; S?omka et al., 2008). \n\nEm geral, a actividade de enzimas antioxidativas aumenta at\u00e9 conte\u00fados de elementos toler\u00e1veis \n\ne, quando as concentra\u00e7\u00f5es excedem este n\u00edvel uma diminui\u00e7\u00e3o subsequente da actividade das \n\nenzimas ocorre (Cao et al., 2004). Isto acontece devio \u00e0 exist\u00eancia de um desequil\u00edbrio entre a \n\ngera\u00e7\u00e3o de ROS e a sua desintoxica\u00e7\u00e3o. A exist\u00eancia de uma interliga\u00e7\u00e3o funcional entre diferentes \n\nenzimas tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 referenciada, sendo que, por exemplo, a SOD \u00e9 o maior eliminador de ROS cuja \n\ntransforma\u00e7\u00e3o gera H2O2 enquanto a CAT e a POD est\u00e3o envolvidas na remo\u00e7\u00e3o de H2O2 gerado \n\npela SOD (Abreu et al., 2014b; Cao et al., 2004; Grant e Loake, 2000). Algumas enzimas podem \n\nainda estar presentes em diferentes localiza\u00e7\u00f5es dentro da c\u00e9lula da planta (ex. em solu\u00e7\u00e3o nos \n\nmeios aquosos da c\u00e9lula ou ligada a componentes da parede celular atrav\u00e9s de interac\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nelectrost\u00e1ticas) sugerindo diferentes fun\u00e7\u00f5es fisiol\u00f3gicas, como observado para o C. ladanifer (Santos \n\net al., 2009). \n\nV\u00e1rios componentes n\u00e3o enzim\u00e1ticos, tais como ti\u00f3is totais, prolina, glutationas, entre outros, s\u00e3o \n\nindicados como eficazes inibidores de ROS ou como constituintes capazes de se ligar a i\u00f5es \n\nmet\u00e1licos formando complexos menos t\u00f3xicos (Abreu et al., 2014b; Ali et la., 2013; Tekli? et al., 2008; \n\nZitka et al., 2013). De facto, o aumento dos teores de ti\u00f3is totais, glutationase e prolina \u00e9 indicado \n\ncomo mecanismos de toler\u00e2ncia face ao aumento de Ni e Zn em folhas e caules de Vicia faba L. \n\ncultivadas em solo contaminado artificialmente (Nadg\u00f3rska-Socha et al., 2013). Por outro lado, Cao et \n\nal. (2004) registaram tend\u00eancia semelhante entre o conte\u00fado de antioxidantes n\u00e3o enzim\u00e1ticos \n\n(glutationas e ti\u00f3is) e o aumento das concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de As no solo e, consequentemente, maior \n\nconte\u00fado do mesmo elemento na raiz e folhas de Pteris vittata L.. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\n \n\n\n\nTecnologias de reabilita\u00e7\u00e3o de solos/escombreiras contaminados com elementos qu\u00edmicos \n\n25 \n\n \n\n1.5 TECNOLOGIAS DE REABILITA\u00c7\u00c3O DE SOLOS/ESCOMBREIRAS CONTAMINADOS \n\nCOM ELEMENTOS QU\u00cdMICOS \n\n  \n\nUma vez que os elementos qu\u00edmicos n\u00e3o se degradam, estes acumulam-se no meio e, \n\nconsequentemente, provocam efeitos delet\u00e9rios nos organismos e nas fun\u00e7\u00f5es dos ecossistemas. \n\nAl\u00e9m disso, muitos s\u00e3o os efeitos nocivos dos elementos qu\u00edmicos na sa\u00fade humana (Ali et al., \n\n2013). Assim, \u00e9 evidente a necessidade de remedia\u00e7\u00e3o/reabilita\u00e7\u00e3o dos meios \n\ndegradados/contaminados. \n\nPara reabilita\u00e7\u00e3o de solos contaminados por metais e metal\u00f3ides existem v\u00e1rias tecnologias (Ali et \n\nal., 2013; Bech et al., 2014; Khan et al., 2004). Para a sua selec\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 fundamental possuir o m\u00e1ximo \n\nde informa\u00e7\u00e3o sobre o problema (ex. distribui\u00e7\u00e3o da contamina\u00e7\u00e3o) bem como, a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\nlocal (ex. geol\u00f3gica, clim\u00e1tica e geomorfol\u00f3gica) e dos materiais (ex. composi\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica) (Bech et \n\nal., 2014). O custo e a efici\u00eancia da t\u00e9cnica s\u00e3o factores que, evidentemente, t\u00eam que ser tidos em \n\nconta. \n\nAs tecnologias convencionais s\u00e3o baseadas em processos f\u00edsico-qu\u00edmicos associados \u00e0 \n\nengenharia (ex. encapsula\u00e7\u00e3o, vitrifica\u00e7\u00e3o, tratamento electrocin\u00e9tico, entre outras) apresentando \n\ngrandes limita\u00e7\u00f5es, nomeadamente elevado custo de implementa\u00e7\u00e3o, mudan\u00e7as irrevers\u00edveis nas \n\ncaracter\u00edsticas do solo (ex. estrutura, fertilidade, comunidade microbiana/microflora) e necessidade de \n\nrestaura\u00e7\u00e3o do local, sendo apropriada apenas em pequenas \u00e1reas (Abreu e Magalh\u00e3es, 2009; \n\nAdriano et al., 2004; Barcel\u00f3 e Poschenrieder, 2003; Khan et al., 2004). Al\u00e9m disso, algumas t\u00e9cnicas \n\ntamb\u00e9m podem conduzir a uma contamina\u00e7\u00e3o secund\u00e1ria (Ali et al., 2013; Ghosh e Singh, 2005). \n\nEstas limita\u00e7\u00f5es ainda se acentuam mais aquando da reabilita\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1reas com contamina\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nmultielementar e com materiais geradores de drenagem \u00e1cida (ex. solo/escombreiras das \u00e1reas \n\nmineiras da FPI) sendo a efici\u00eancia muito baixa a m\u00e9dio prazo.  \n\nSegundo S\u00e1inz et al. (2003), a gera\u00e7\u00e3o de drenagem \u00e1cida na FPI \u00e9 um problema ambiental grave \n\nsendo o seu tratamento insustent\u00e1vel devido \u00e0 sua extrema acidez, concentra\u00e7\u00f5es multielementares \n\nelevadas bem como \u00e0 exist\u00eancia de uma vasta \u00e1rea de escombreiras geradoras de AMD. De facto, \n\nnas \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas a Junta da Andaluzia fez um consider\u00e1vel investimento na remedia\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\nreabilita\u00e7\u00e3o de algumas escombreiras com vista \u00e0 redu\u00e7\u00e3o do impacto ambiental da AMD, por\u00e9m \n\nestas tentativas foram ineficazes (Sanch\u00e9z-Espa\u00f1a et al., 2005). \n\nDas outras t\u00e9cnicas existentes, designadas em alguns casos como tecnologias verdes ou eco-\n\nfriendly (globalmente designadas por fitorremedia\u00e7\u00e3o ou fitotecnologias), s\u00e3o usadas plantas no \n\nprocesso de reabilita\u00e7\u00e3o, o qual tem um menor custo de implementa\u00e7\u00e3o comparativamente \u00e0s \n\nt\u00e9cnicas indicadas anteriormente (Ali et al., 2013; Barcel\u00f3 e Poschenrieder, 2003; Mendez e Maier, \n\n2008). De um modo geral, as t\u00e9cnicas de fitorremedia\u00e7\u00e3o (Fig. 3) baseiam-se no uso de plantas in \n\nsitu (o que envolve inevitavelmente tamb\u00e9m a comunidade de microorganismos da rizosfera) para \n\nreduzir e/ou estabilizar os elementos existentes no meio (solos, \u00e1guas ou sedimentos) e, \n\nconsequentemente, o seu efeito t\u00f3xico para ambiente (Barcel\u00f3 e Poschenrieder, 2003; Favas et al., \n\n2014). \n\n\n\nTecnologias de reabilita\u00e7\u00e3o de solos/escombreiras contaminados com elementos qu\u00edmicos \n\n26 \n\n \n\nFitovolatiliza\u00e7\u00e3o\n\nFitodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o\n\nFitodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o\n\nFitoestimula\u00e7\u00e3o\n\nFitoextrac\u00e7\u00e3o\n\nFitoestabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o\n\nFitoextrac\u00e7\u00e3o\n\n \n\nFig. 3 Esquema das t\u00e9cnicas de fitorremedia\u00e7\u00e3o existentes (Adaptado de Favas et al., 2014). \n\n \n\nDe entre as fitotecnologias, a fitoestabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 a que maior efici\u00eancia apresenta na reabilita\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde \u00e1reas mineiras com contamina\u00e7\u00e3o multielementar em climas temperados, \u00e1ridos e semi\u00e1ridos \n\n(Abreu e Magalh\u00e3es, 2009; Mendez e Maier, 2008; Tordoff et al., 2000). Assim, nesta t\u00e9cnica utilizam-\n\nse plantas tolerantes, com ou sem adi\u00e7\u00e3o de correctivos (materiais inorg\u00e2nicos e/ou org\u00e2nicos) ao \n\nsolo/escombreira, com o objectivo de reduzir a disponibilidade dos EPTs atrav\u00e9s da imobiliza\u00e7\u00e3o dos \n\nmesmos por processos de absor\u00e7\u00e3o/acumula\u00e7\u00e3o pelas ra\u00edzes bem como precipita\u00e7\u00e3o, complexa\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nou redu\u00e7\u00e3o na rizosfera (Ali et al., 2013; Abreu e Magalh\u00e3es, 2009; Adriano et al., 2004; Barcel\u00f3 e \n\nPoschenrieder, 2003; Favas et al., 2014; Ghosh e Singh, 2005; Mendez e Maier, 2008; Tordoff et al., \n\n2000; Wong 2003) (Fig. 4). \n\nDeste modo, apesar da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o total dos elementos no solo permanecer inalterada o \n\npotencial risco de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 reduzido significativamente (Ghosh e Singh, 2005). Ainda como \n\nvantagens, e segundo os autores anteriormente citados, refere-se que o desenvolvimento de plantas \n\ncontribui para minimiza\u00e7\u00e3o da eros\u00e3o superficial, do impacto visual na paisagem e da lixivia\u00e7\u00e3o bem \n\ncomo da melhoria das caracter\u00edsticas dos substratos atrav\u00e9s do aumento do conte\u00fado em mat\u00e9ria \n\norg\u00e2nica e capacidade de reten\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua, recupera\u00e7\u00e3o/promo\u00e7\u00e3o da estrutura do solo e \n\nestimula\u00e7\u00e3o do desenvolvimento de comunidades de microfauna/microbiana relevantes nos \n\nprocessos biol\u00f3gicos. De facto, de Varennes et al. (2010) observou um aumento r\u00e1pido (ensaio de \n\n\n\nTecnologias de reabilita\u00e7\u00e3o de solos/escombreiras contaminados com elementos qu\u00edmicos \n\n27 \n \n\n \n\nmicrocosmo de seis meses) da actividade de algumas enzimas (ex. desidrogenase, celulase, \n\nfosfatase, ?-glucosidase e urease) em solos, desenvolvidos sobre gossan da mina de S\u00e3o Domingos, \n\napenas com o crescimento de Dactylis glomerata L. cv.

De um modo geral, as plantas a usar nesta t\u00e9cnica devem ter uma \n\nestrat\u00e9gia de excluidoras (excluders), e n\u00e3o indicadoras ou hiperacumuladoras, a qual se caracteriza \n\npela acumula\u00e7\u00e3o dos elementos na raiz restringindo a sua transloca\u00e7\u00e3o para a parte a\u00e9rea \n\n(coeficiente de transloca\u00e7\u00e3o &lt;1), o que mantem a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o baixa nos \u00f3rg\u00e3os da parte a\u00e9rea \n\nindependentemente da gama de concentra\u00e7\u00e3o dos mesmos elementos no solo (Ghosh e Singh, \n\n2005).

Igualmente importante \u00e9 a contribui\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndos correctivos no aumento da biomassa acumulada das plantas (de Varennes et al., 2009, 2010; \n\nAlvarenga et al., 2008a; P\u00e9rez-de-Mora et al., 2011; Santib\u00e1\u00f1ez et al., 2008). \n\nA diminui\u00e7\u00e3o da disponibilidade dos elementos, especialmente em substratos contendo alta \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o de cati\u00f5es (ex. Cu, Pb ou Zn), atrav\u00e9s da precipita\u00e7\u00e3o dos mesmos pela aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nres\u00edduos/compostos carbonatados (ex. cinzas de biomassa, sugarbeet lime ou cal) \u00e9 um dos \n\nprocessos correctivos mais comuns (Adriano et al., 2004; Bolan et al., 2014; Burgos et al., 2010; \n\nClemente et al., 2006; Kumpiene et al., 2008; Mendez e Maier, 2008; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2007; \n\nRodr\u00edguez-Jord\u00e1 et al., 2010; Tordoff et al., 2000; Wong, 2003), contudo esta pode ser uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ntempor\u00e1ria caso os materiais sejam geradores de acidez. O efeito resultante da aplica\u00e7\u00e3o destes \n\nmateriais sobre a imobiliza\u00e7\u00e3o dos elementos qu\u00edmicos relaciona-se com as mudan\u00e7as relativas de \n\npH e, consequentemente, precipita\u00e7\u00e3o dos elementos como hidr\u00f3xidos ou carbonatos. Al\u00e9m disso, \u00e9 \n\nde salientar que estes compostos podem ter apenas um efeito t\u00e9nue na reabilita\u00e7\u00e3o dos solos. Neste \n\nsentido, Rodr\u00edguez-Jord\u00e1 et al. (2010) verificaram que a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de res\u00edduos industriais ricos em \n\ncarbonatos (Quadro 3) apenas reduzia a lixivia\u00e7\u00e3o do Ni, Pb e Zn e n\u00e3o propriamente a frac\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\ncomplexo de troca (frac\u00e7\u00e3o dispon\u00edvel extra\u00edda com DTPA).  \n\n.  \n\n\n\nTecnologias de reabilita\u00e7\u00e3o de solos/escombreiras contaminados com elementos qu\u00edmicos \n\n29 \n\n \n\nQuadro 3 Alguns exemplos de correctivos usados/testados na reabilita\u00e7\u00e3o de solos contaminados. \n\n \n\nMateriais a reabilitar Correctivos Elementos Ensaio e esp\u00e9cies usadas \n\nSolos contaminados da mina de Aljustrel\na\n \n\nLamas de ETAR \n\nRes\u00edduo da fabrica\u00e7\u00e3o de a\u00e7\u00facar de beterraba \nCu, Pb, Zn \n\nEnsaio em vaso, estufa \n\nLolium multiflorum Lam \n\nSolos contaminados pelo acidente da mina \n\nde Aznalc\u00f3llar\nb\n \n\nRes\u00edduo da extrac\u00e7\u00e3o do azeite \n\nComposto de bioss\u00f3lidos \n\nRes\u00edduo da fabrica\u00e7\u00e3o de a\u00e7\u00facar de beterraba \n\nCd, Cu, Mn, Zn Ensaio em vaso em c\u00e2mara de crescimento \n\nSolos contaminados pelo acidente da mina \n\nde Aznalc\u00f3llar\nc\n \n\nEstrume \n\nComposto \n\nCalc\u00e1rio \n\nCd,Cu, Fe,Mn, \n\nPb, Zn \n\nEnsaio de campo \n\nBrassica juncea (L.)

Al\u00e9m disso, consoante a fonte, a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de fosfato no solo pode \n\ncausar adsor\u00e7\u00e3o directa dos cati\u00f5es atrav\u00e9s do aumento da carga de superf\u00edcie (Adriano et al., 2004). \n\nDe um modo geral, a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de correctivos org\u00e2nicos ao solo melhora a fertilidade, a estrutura \n\ne a actividade microbiana bem como diminui a disponibilidade dos cati\u00f5es devido \u00e0 forma\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\ncomplexos organo-met\u00e1licos, aumento da capacidade de troca cati\u00f3nica ou das reac\u00e7\u00f5es redox \n\n(Adriano et al., 2004; Bolan et al., 2014; Burgos et al., 2010; Clemente et al., 2006; Tejada et al., \n\n2008). A capacidade de imobiliza\u00e7\u00e3o depende do elemento, do tipo de solo e do tipo de mat\u00e9ria \n\norg\u00e2nica (Adriano et al., 2004; Bolan et al., 2014; Burgos et al., 2010; Kumpiene et al., 2008; Tejada \n\net al., 2008). De facto, a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de bioss\u00f3lidos frescos (ou sem pr\u00e9via matura\u00e7\u00e3o), os quais \n\napresentam geralmente baixo n\u00edvel de humifica\u00e7\u00e3o, contribuiu para a mobiliza\u00e7\u00e3o dos elementos \n\nqu\u00edmicos (Santib\u00e1\u00f1ez et al., 2008). \n\nA contribui\u00e7\u00e3o dos correctivos depender\u00e1 das suas caracter\u00edsticas e do tipo de resposta face aos \n\ncomponentes do solo a reabilitar, pois os mesmos correctivos podem ter um efeito diferente \n\nconsoante as caracter\u00edsticas do solo (Burgo et al., 2010). Por outro lado, alguns correctivos, embora \n\npossam promover o desenvolvimento das plantas, aumentam o conte\u00fado de C org\u00e2nico dissolvido o \n\nque leva ao aumento da disponibilidade dos elementos e, consequentemente, \u00e0 lixivia\u00e7\u00e3o dos \n\nmesmos (Santib\u00e1\u00f1ez et al., 2008). \n\n\u00c9 de salientar ainda que, por vezes, pode n\u00e3o ocorrer a melhoria imediata de algumas \n\npropriedades dos solos/escombreiras. Hinojosa et al. (2008) observou um aumento da actividade \n\nenzim\u00e1tica ap\u00f3s aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de sugarbeeet lime em solos contaminados, contudo a frac\u00e7\u00e3o dispon\u00edvel \n\nde Cu, Pb e Zn (extra\u00edda com DTPA) n\u00e3o mostrou diferen\u00e7as. A mesma tend\u00eancia foi indicada por de \n\nVarennes et al. (2010) onde a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de composto a solos desenvolvidos sobre gossan aumentou \n\na actividade enzim\u00e1tica enquanto as concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de Pb, Cu, Mn e Zn na frac\u00e7\u00e3o dispon\u00edvel n\u00e3o \n\nforam afectadas. Mesmo a n\u00edvel biol\u00f3gico e tendo em conta que as respostas do microbiota s\u00e3o \n\nrelativamente r\u00e1pidas face \u00e0 aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de correctivos org\u00e2nicos, por vezes o mau estado \n\nmicrobiol\u00f3gico do meio original implica primeiro o aumento da biomassa microbiana em vez da \n\nestimula\u00e7\u00e3o das fun\u00e7\u00f5es bioqu\u00edmicas (Burgo et al., 2010; P\u00e9rez-de-Mora et al., 2005). \n\nEm locais com clima \u00e1rido ou semi\u00e1rido, o sucesso do estabelecimento de plantas, mesmo que \n\ntolerantes e aut\u00f3ctones, directamente nos solos a reabilitar pode ser um processo dif\u00edcil. P\u00e9rez-de-\n\nMora et al. (2011) verificou que a coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o natural (avaliada pelo grau de cobertura, biomassa \n\nproduzida e riqueza espec\u00edfica de plantas vasculares) de solos contaminados pelo acidente da mina \n\nde Aznalc\u00f3llar foi mais r\u00e1pida em plots com a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de correctivos (Quadro 3). Por outro lado, em \n\nalguns tipos de escombreiras pode ser mesmo invi\u00e1vel (Tordoff et al., 2010). \n\nAssim, a implementa\u00e7\u00e3o do processo de fitoestabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o com adi\u00e7\u00e3o de correctivos pode acelerar \n\no processo de reabilita\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1reas contaminadas/degradas (Adriano et al., 2004; Favas et al., 2014; \n\nFreitas et al., 2004a). De Varennes et al. (2009, 2010) e Madej\u00f3n et al. (2009) observaram uma \n\nmelhoria mais significativa das caracter\u00edsticas dos solos (ex. actividade enzim\u00e1tica, respira\u00e7\u00e3o basal, \n\n\n\nTecnologias de reabilita\u00e7\u00e3o de solos/escombreiras contaminados com elementos qu\u00edmicos \n\n32 \n\n \n\nbiomassa microbiana, pH e/ou conte\u00fado de C org\u00e2nico) com a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de res\u00edduos org\u00e2nicos e/ou \n\ninorg\u00e2nicos conjuntamente como crescimento de diferentes esp\u00e9cies (Quadro 3) comparativamente \n\naos solos onde se fez unicamente aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de res\u00edduos sem crescimento das plantas. \n\nNo entanto, \u00e9 de real\u00e7ar que o efeito dos res\u00edduos, por aplica\u00e7\u00e3o individual ou em misturas, pode \n\nn\u00e3o se manter a m\u00e9dio-longo prazo pois, apenas alguns dos processos biogeoqu\u00edmicos (ou \n\npropriedades dos solos/escombreiras) s\u00e3o melhorados. De facto, P\u00e9rez-de-Mora et al. (2011) indica \n\nque a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o repetida de correctivos pode ser necess\u00e1ria para a melhoria do desenvolvimento da \n\nvegeta\u00e7\u00e3o e da redu\u00e7\u00e3o da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o dos EPTs nas plantas. \n\nAssim, o sucesso da fitoestabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o das \u00e1reas mineiras a m\u00e9dio-longo prazo pode residir na \n\nconcep\u00e7\u00e3o de um solo artificial derivado de res\u00edduos (Tecnossolo \u2013 IUSS WorkingGroup WRB) de \n\ncaracter\u00edsticas adequadas ao objectivo da reabilita\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental (Tecnossolo \u201c\u00e0 la carte\u201d) que \n\npromova o crescimento de vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o (Mac\u00edas, 2004; Mac\u00edas et al., 2007, 2011). Segundo estes \n\nautores, nos Tecnossolos s\u00e3o criados/estimulados diferentes processos biogeoqu\u00edmicos e de \n\npedog\u00e9nese, devido aos efeitos complementares de cada componente, conduzindo assim \u00e0 \n\nsustentabilidade do processo a m\u00e9dio-longo prazo. Esta condi\u00e7\u00e3o ainda tem mais relev\u00e2ncia para as \n\n\u00e1reas mineiras que apresentam uma contamina\u00e7\u00e3o multielementar e que geram drenagem \u00e1cida \n\n(Kumpiene et al., 2008) bem como aquelas que apresentam materiais de escombreira de \n\ngranulometria grosseira ou muito fina. \u00c9 de real\u00e7ar ainda que, as perdas de C e N para a atmosfera \n\npelos Tecnossolos s\u00e3o menores em compara\u00e7\u00e3o com a compostagem, devido \u00e0 estabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o do C \n\norg\u00e2nico o que contribui para uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o dos gases de efeito estufa e, consequentemente, da \n\npegada ambiental do C (Mac\u00edas, 2004; Mac\u00edas e Arbestain, 2010). \n\nO uso de Tecnossolos para recupera\u00e7\u00e3o de escombreiras de sulfuretos foi realizada com sucesso \n\nnas minas de As Pontes e Touro, ambas na Galiza ? Espanha, onde se verificou uma diminui\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\ngera\u00e7\u00e3o de drenagem \u00e1cida, com a consequente melhoria da qualidade das \u00e1guas superficiais e \n\nsubterr\u00e2neas, mas tamb\u00e9m da atividade biol\u00f3gica e promo\u00e7\u00e3o da biodiversidade (Mac\u00edas et al., 2007; \n\nMonterroso et al., 1998). \n\nV\u00e1rios s\u00e3o os res\u00edduos industriais ou agro-industriais que podem ser usados para a concep\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde Tecnossolos, devido \u00e0s suas caracter\u00edsticas intr\u00ednsecas, grandes quantidades dispon\u00edveis e custo \n\npraticamente \u201czero\u201d (muitas vezes s\u00f3 associado ao transporte), tendo deste modo um destino \n\neconomicamente atractivo em vez de serem depositados em aterro (Mac\u00edas, 2004; Mac\u00edas et al., \n\n2007, 2011). A selec\u00e7\u00e3o dos res\u00edduos \u00e9 um ponto fulcral no processo de concep\u00e7\u00e3o do Tecnossolo \n\nao n\u00edvel ambiental e econ\u00f3mico pois, alguns res\u00edduos cont\u00eam elevadas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de elementos \n\nqu\u00edmicos ou precisam de um per\u00edodo de matura\u00e7\u00e3o (ex. lamas de ETAR ou composto). \n\n\n\nCaracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o de Cistus ladanifer e lavandula pedunculata e seus produtos \n\n33 \n\n \n\n1.6 CARACTERIZA\u00c7\u00c3O DE CISTUS LADANIFER E LAVANDULA PEDUNCULATA E \n\nSEUS PRODUTOS \n\n  \n\nO Cistus ladanifer L.

Como para outras esp\u00e9cies de Cistus (Abreu et al., 2012a,b; Favas et al., \n\n\n\nCaracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o de Cistus ladanifer e lavandula pedunculata e seus produtos \n\n34 \n\n \n\n2014), o grau de toler\u00e2ncia e os padr\u00f5es de acumula\u00e7\u00e3o dentro da planta face ao n\u00edvel de \n\ncontamina\u00e7\u00e3o parecem estar relacionados com a popula\u00e7\u00e3o (Batista et al., 2009; Kidd et al., 2004; \n\nL\u00e1zaro et al., 2006; Santos et al., 2009, 2012, 2013). \n\nA toler\u00e2ncia e adaptabilidade de C. ladanifer aos factores de stresse ambiental e oxidativo est\u00e3o \n\nassociados a mecanismos espec\u00edficos de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua e nutrientes (Nu\u00f1es-Oliveira et al., \n\n1996; Santos et al., 2013), dimorfismo das sementes e consequente varia\u00e7\u00e3o germinativa (Delgado et \n\nal., 2001) bem como, restri\u00e7\u00e3o dos EPTs na raiz (Alvarenga et al., 2004; Batista et al., 2009; Kidd et \n\nal., 2004; Santos et al., 2012) e actividade de enzimas antioxidativas em diferentes locais das c\u00e9lulas \n\ndas folhas (Santos et al., 2009). A taxa de crescimento desta esp\u00e9cie \u00e9 elevada, quando as \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es o permitem, produzindo consider\u00e1vel biomassa em relativamente pouco tempo (Nu\u00f1ez et \n\nal., 1989; Pat\u00f3n et al., 1998).  \n\nA Lavandula pedunculata (Mill.) Cav. (sin\u00f3nimos Stoechas pedunculata Mill, L. pedunculata subsp. \n\nsampaiana (Rozeira) Franco; L.. sampaiana (Rozeira) Rivas Mart., TE D\u00edaz &amp; Fern. Gonz e L. \n\nstoechas subsp. pedunculata (Mill.) Rozeira) \u00e9 uma das esp\u00e9cies arom\u00e1ticas da Familia das \n\nLamiaceae, vulgarmente conhecida por rosmaninho, lavanda ou lavandula (Fig. 6). \u00c9 encontrada na \n\nPeninsula Ib\u00e9rica, mais frequentemente para o interior, e Norte de Africa em diferentes habitats e \n\ntipos de solos. \n\n \n\nFig. 6 Planta de Lavandula pedunculata. \n\nEsta esp\u00e9cie tamb\u00e9m foi identificada em algumas \u00e1reas mineiras (Pratas et al., 2005; Quental et \n\nal., 2002), nomeadamente em S\u00e3o Domingos (Freitas et al., 2004a), por\u00e9m pouco \u00e9 documentado \n\n\n\nCaracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o de Cistus ladanifer e lavandula pedunculata e seus produtos \n\n35 \n\n \n\nsobre esta planta em ambientes contaminados. Al\u00e9m disso, o conhecimento sobre o seu \n\ncomportamento ecofisiol\u00f3gico em condi\u00e7\u00f5es de contamina\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 escasso. \n\nActualmente, os produtos derivados destas plantas arom\u00e1ticas apresentam uma crescente \n\ntend\u00eancia de mercado n\u00e3o s\u00f3 para a ind\u00fastria de perfumaria/cosm\u00e9tica, farmac\u00eautica (extrac\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\ncompostos bioactivos) e terap\u00eautica (extractos, infus\u00f5es, tinturas ou c\u00e1psulas) mas tamb\u00e9m para o \n\nsector industrial (explora\u00e7\u00e3o de tintas, corantes, produtos fitofarmac\u00eauticos ou detergentes) (Lubbe e \n\nVerpoorte, 2011; Raut e Karuppayil, 2014). No entanto, o uso destas plantas em ch\u00e1/infus\u00f5es ou \n\nextractos, nomeadamente sob a forma de \u00f3leos, tinturas ou extractos aquosos, \u00e9 uma pr\u00e1tica antiga \n\nem sistemas tradicionais (WHO, 2007). \n\nO Cistus ladanifer tem sido usado desde os tempos antigos, nomeadamente desde os egipc\u00edos, \n\ndevido ao seu exsudado arom\u00e1tico ou resina (vulgarmente designado como l\u00e1udano), para tratar \n\nv\u00e1rios problemas de sa\u00fade (ex. diarreia, disenteria, catarro e desconforto da menstrua\u00e7\u00e3o). \n\nActualmente, o \u00f3leo de esteva (mas tamb\u00e9m o l\u00e1udano) tem um elevado interesse para a ind\u00fastria \n\nfarmac\u00eautica e perfumaria devido \u00e0 sua propriedade fixadora de aromas e car\u00e1cter anti-s\u00e9ptico, \n\nadstringente, t\u00f3nico, expectorante e bals\u00e2mico (Barraj\u00f3n-Catal\u00e1n et al., 2010). De facto, extractos de \n\nfolhas de esteva s\u00e3o uma fonte de distintos metabolitos secund\u00e1rios (ex. fen\u00f3licos, terpernos, \u00e1cidos \n\ngordos) com actividades antioxidantes e antimicrobianas (Andrade et al., 2009; Barraj\u00f3n-Catal\u00e1n et \n\nal., 2010) bem como f\u00fangicas (Barros et al., 2013). Mesmo alguns estudos preliminares de actividade \n\ncitot\u00f3xica de extractos aquosos de esteva em c\u00e9lulas cancerosas do p\u00e2ncreas e mama t\u00eam mostrado \n\nalgum potencial para suportar novos estudos (Barraj\u00f3n-Catal\u00e1n et al., 2010). \n\nDe igual modo, o uso de plantas do g\u00e9nero Lavandula como um agente terap\u00eautico remonta desde \n\nos romanos e gregos (Cavanagh e Wilkinson, 2002). Em Portugal, estudos etnobot\u00e2nicos referem o \n\nuso de infus\u00f5es de rosmaninho, para uso interno ou externo, devido \u00e0s suas propriedades \n\nantiss\u00e9pticas, b\u00e9quico, anti-inflamat\u00f3rio, anti-reum\u00e1tico, antiespasm\u00f3dico, digestivo, diur\u00e9tico e \n\ncalmante (Figueiredo et al., 2014). Cavanagh e Wilkinson (2002) tamb\u00e9m refere, para al\u00e9m das \n\nenunciadas, v\u00e1rias actividades biol\u00f3gicas de \u00f3leos de plantas do g\u00e9nero Lavandula. A Lavandula \n\npedunculata \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m indicada como uma fonte de compostos naturais capazes de prevenir doen\u00e7as \n\nneurodegenerativas (Costa et al., 2009) e com importante atividade antif\u00fangica (Zuzarte et al., 2009). \n\n\u00c9 de real\u00e7ar que, na maioria das vezes, a bioactividade destes produtos pode estar associada a mais \n\ndo que um componente do extracto, que pode n\u00e3o ser o maiorit\u00e1rio (Bakkali et al., 2008). \n\nDe um modo geral, a produtividade e variabilidade fitoqu\u00edmica dos produtos derivados de esp\u00e9cies \n\narom\u00e1ticas depende de v\u00e1rios factores associados \u00e0s plantas (esp\u00e9cie, ec\u00f3tipo ou idade da planta) e \n\n\u00e0s condi\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais e do meio onde as plantas se desenvolvem (Raut e Karuppayil, 2014). De \n\nfacto, j\u00e1 foi observada varia\u00e7\u00e3o na composi\u00e7\u00e3o org\u00e2nica e, consequentemente, na actividade \n\nantioxidante segundo a esp\u00e9cie de Lavandula (Matos et al., 2009; Teixeira et al., 2013). Gonz\u00e1lez-\n\nColoma et al. (2011) tamb\u00e9m verificaram que a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o dos componentes maiorit\u00e1rios de \n\nextractos de Lavandula luisieri (Rozeira) Rivas Mart. (extra\u00eddos com \u00e1gua e por hidrodestila\u00e7\u00e3o) \n\nvariam consoante a popula\u00e7\u00e3o de plantas silvestres e condi\u00e7\u00f5es de crescimento (silvestres Vs \n\ncultivadas). Ainda para L. dentata L., Masetto et al. (2011) concluiram que o teor de \u00f3leo extra\u00eddo, por \n\n\n\nCaracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o de Cistus ladanifer e lavandula pedunculata e seus produtos \n\n36 \n\n \n\nhidrodestila\u00e7\u00e3o, e a composi\u00e7\u00e3o org\u00e2nica variava com o est\u00e1dio de desenvolvimento floral da esp\u00e9cie \n\ne a \u00e9poca de colheita. \n\nA composi\u00e7\u00e3o org\u00e2nica de extractos aquosos das folhas de plantas pertencentes ao g\u00e9nero Cistus \n\ntamb\u00e9m est\u00e1 fortemente relacionada com o seu subg\u00e9nero, por\u00e9m as caracter\u00edsticas do solo e o \n\nclima s\u00e3o factores que t\u00eam menor influ\u00eancia (Barraj\u00f3n-Catal\u00e1n et al., 2011). \n\nPor outro lado, o rendimento e a composi\u00e7\u00e3o dos extractos vegetais e, consequentemente, as \n\nsuas propriedades biol\u00f3gicas variam com o material vegetal e o m\u00e9todo de extrac\u00e7\u00e3o (Raut e \n\nKaruppayil, 2014). Gonz\u00e1lez-Coloma et al. (2011) constataram que a composi\u00e7\u00e3o maiorit\u00e1ria de \n\nextractos de L. luisieri depende da parte da planta usada (flores ou folhas) na extrac\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nRelativamente \u00e0s metodologias, Andrade et al. (2009) verificaram que a extrac\u00e7\u00e3o com acetona do \n\n\u00f3leo da parte a\u00e9rea de C. ladanifer tinha um maior rendimento de extrac\u00e7\u00e3o (14,19 %) e \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o total de compostos fen\u00f3licos (334,56 mg GAE/g extracto; GAE ? gallic acid equivalent) \n\ne flavon\u00f3ides (23,37 mg QE/g extracto; QE ? quercetin equivalent), do que a realizada com etanol \n\n(8,49 %, 255,19 mg GAE/g extracto e 20,50 mg QE/g extracto). O rendimento e as propriedades \n\nantioxidantes de extractos metan\u00f3licos de C. ladanifer s\u00e3o ainda melhores do que os obtidos com \n\nacetona (Guimar\u00e3es et al., 2010). Resultados semelhantes foram tamb\u00e9m obtidos para L. \n\npedunculata onde o rendimento e a composi\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica varia consoante a solu\u00e7\u00e3o extractante e, \n\nconsequentemente, as suas propriedades antiradicais e antioxidantes (Costa et al., 2013; Teixeira et \n\nal., 2013). \n\nV\u00e1rios estudos t\u00eam sido realizados para a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o de extractos vegetais de C. ladanifer e \n\ndas suas actividades biol\u00f3gicas e/ou potenciais aplica\u00e7\u00f5es industriais (Fern\u00e1ndez-Arroyo et al., 2010; \n\nGuimar\u00e3es et al., 2009, 2010; Verdeguer et al., 2011; Zidane et al., 2013). No entanto, os estudos \n\npara o g\u00e9nero Lavandula resumem-se a extractos sob a forma de \u00f3leo essencial sendo que, em \n\nparticular, para a esp\u00e9cie L. pedunculata os estudos s\u00e3o escassos (Costa et al., 2013; Matos et al., \n\n2009; Teixeira et al., 2013; Zuzarte et al., 2009, 2010). \n\nO conte\u00fado de elementos qu\u00edmicos, tanto nas mat\u00e9rias-primas vegetais como nos produtos \n\nderivados das plantas arom\u00e1ticas/medicinais \u00e9 um ponto importante a determinar j\u00e1 que podem ser \n\nconsiderados uma fonte de nutrientes mas, tamb\u00e9m de risco para a sa\u00fade p\u00fablica. De facto, WHO \n\n(2007) editou uma s\u00e9rie de guidelines para avalia\u00e7\u00e3o das plantas medicinais devido ao risco que \n\nexiste para a sa\u00fade p\u00fablica. \n\nEmbora Zheljazkov et al. (2008) tenham observado que altas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de Cu, Cd e Pb no \n\nsolo ou no meio de crescimento n\u00e3o conduzem \u00e0 transfer\u00eancia dos mesmos elementos para o \u00f3leo \n\nessencial de v\u00e1rias esp\u00e9cies de plantas arom\u00e1ticas (Coriandrum sativum L., Anethum graveolens L., \n\nChamomilla recutita (L.) K., Mentha x piperita L., Ocimum basilicum L., Hyssopus officinalis L., \n\nMelissa officinalis L. e Salvia officinalis L.), nenhuma informa\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e1 dispon\u00edvel acerca da influ\u00eancia \n\ndos contaminantes do solo na composi\u00e7\u00e3o e qualidade de produtos derivados de plantas de C. \n\nladanifer e L. pedunculata (ou mesmo de esp\u00e9cies de plantas do mesmo g\u00e9nero). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nRefer\u00eancias bibliogr\u00e1ficas \n\n37 \n\n \n\n1.7 REFER\u00caNCIAS BIBLIOGR\u00c1FICAS \n\n \nAbreu, M.M., Magalh\u00e3es, M.C.F., 2009.

INTER-POPULATION VARIATION ON THE \n\nACCUMULATION AND TRANSLOCATION OF \n\nPOTENTIALLY HARMFUL CHEMICAL ELEMENTS IN \n\nCISTUS LADANIFER L. FROM BRANCANES, \n\nCAVEIRA, CHAN\u00c7A, LOUSAL, NEVES CORVO AND \n\nS\u00c3O DOMINGOS MINES IN THE PORTUGUESE \n\nIBERIAN PYRITE BELT \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nInter-population variation on the accumulation and translocation of potentially harmful chemical elements in Cistus ladanifer L. \nfrom Brancanes, Caveira, Chan\u00e7a, Lousal, Neves Corvo and S\u00e3o Domingos mines in the Portuguese Iberian Pyrite Belt \n\n49 \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\n \n\nThis study aimed to compare the variation on the accumulation and translocation of potentially harmful \n\nchemical elements and nutrients (As, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) in Cistus ladanifer L. \n\nbelonging to populations growing in different mine areas from the Portuguese Iberian Pyrite Belt \n\n(Brancanes, Caveira, Chan\u00e7a, Lousal, Neves Corvo, S\u00e3o Domingos). These mines are abandoned, \n\n(except Neves Corvo that is still operating) and have different contamination levels. \n\nComposite samples of soils (n = 31), developed on different mine wastes and/or host rock, and C. \n\nladanifer plants (roots and shoots) were collected in the mine areas. Soils were characterized for pH, \n\nNPK and organic C, by classical methodologies. Soils (total fraction ? four acid digestion, and \n\navailable fraction ? extracted with aqueous solution of diluted organic acids, simulating rizosphere \n\nconditions) and plants (ashing followed by acid digestion) elemental concentrations, were determined \n\nby ICP. Soil-plant transfer and translocation coefficients were calculated. Principal Components \n\nAnalysis in both ways, the classical method and a second approach with adaptations used mostly in \n\nmultivariate statistical processes control data, were done in order to compare the plants populations. \n\nSoils had large heterogeneity in their characteristics. Caveira, Lousal, Neves Corvo and S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos soils showed the highest total concentrations of As, Cu, Pb and Zn. Independently of the \n\nmine, available fractions of elements were low. Intra and inter-population variations in accumulation \n\nand translocation of elements were evaluated. Plants were not accumulators of the majority of the \n\nanalysed elements. Nutrients were mainly translocated from roots to shoots, while trace elements \n\nwere stored in roots (except in Neves Corvo for As and Pb, and S\u00e3o Domingos for As). Elements \n\nconcentrations in plant populations from Lousal, Chan\u00e7a and S\u00e3o Domingos did not present much \n\nvariation. Brancanes soils and plants presented strong differences compared to other areas. \n\nCistus ladanifer plants are able to survive in mining areas with polymetallic contamination at different \n\nelements concentrations in total and available fraction. This species presented variations inter- and \n\nintra-populations in accumulation and translocation of chemical elements, however all studied \n\npopulations, except Brancanes, can belong to the same population cluster. \n\n \n\nKEYWORDS Iberian Pyrite Belt \u2022 Multivariate statistical process control \u2022 Nonlinear Iterative Partial \n\nLeast Square (NIPALS) \u2022 Principal Components Analysis \u2022 Portugal \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nInter-population variation on the accumulation and translocation of potentially harmful chemical elements in Cistus ladanifer L. \nfrom Brancanes, Caveira, Chan\u00e7a, Lousal, Neves Corvo and S\u00e3o Domingos mines in the Portuguese Iberian Pyrite \n\n \n\n \n50 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBaseado no artigo: Erika S.

These problems can also be observed in the \n\nmines of the Portuguese Iberian Pyrite Belt (PIPB) (Matos and Martins, 2006a). \n\nAlthough in the mining areas can coexist many stress factors for the plants as, for instance, high \n\ntotal concentrations of chemical elements in the soil, low pH, low organic matter content, soil water \n\ndeficit, combined with high radiation and air temperature in summer in mine areas from Mediterranean \n\nregion, some tailings and soils developed on mine wastes are naturally colonized by spontaneous \n\nvegetation. These plants populations usually represent specific ecotypes well adapted to mining \n\nconditions constituting communities with small diversity. The development of this tolerant vegetation \n\ncontributes to the wastes weathering and pedogenesis and the evolution of ecological succession \n\n(Abreu and Magalh\u00e3es, 2009). \n\nCistus ladanifer L. is one of the species identified in several mining areas and its ecological \n\nbehaviour has been studied in each contaminated area by several authors (Abreu et al., 2009, 2011; \n\nAlvarenga et al., 2004; Batista et al., 2007; Chopin and Alloway, 2007; de la Fuente et al., 2010; \n\nFreitas et al., 2004; L\u00e1zaro et al., 2006; Murciego et al., 2007; Pratas et al., 2005; Reglero et al., 2008; \n\nSantos et al., 2009; 2012). This sbrub is a plastic species that shows biological adaptations, as an \n\nefficient system of antioxidant enzymes (Santos et al., 2009) allowing its development in contaminated \n\nmine areas like S\u00e3o Domingos mine. However, studies involving an analysis of several C. ladanifer \n\npopulations from different mine areas are scarce (Abreu et al., 2011; Batista et al., 2007; Chopin and \n\nAlloway, 2007). Furthermore, the majority of the studies were practically focused on copper, lead and \n\nzinc, and sometimes As, while the C. ladanifer\u2013soil relationships regarding nutrients are weakly \n\nknown.  \n\nThis study aimed to compare the variation on the accumulation and translocation of potentially \n\nharmful chemical elements and nutrients (As, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) in Cistus \n\nladanifer populations growing in different mine areas from the Portuguese Iberian Pyrite Belt \n\n(Brancanes, Caveira, Chan\u00e7a, Lousal, Neves Corvo, and S\u00e3o Domingos). \n\n \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n\nSite characterization \n\n \n\nSix mining areas located in Alentejo region in the Portuguese Iberian Pyrite Belt were studied: \n\nBrancanes, Caveira, Chan\u00e7a, Lousal, Neves Corvo and S\u00e3o Domingos mining areas. These mines \n\nare nowadays abandoned, except Neves Corvo that is still operating.The location of these mines in \n\nPIPB region is shown in Figure 1; Caveira and Lousal mines are located in the NW part (\u00b112 km away \n\nfrom each other); Brancanes and Neves Corvo are situated in the SW region (\u00b13 km away from each \n\n\n\nInter-population variation on the accumulation and translocation of potentially harmful chemical elements in Cistus ladanifer L. \nfrom Brancanes, Caveira, Chan\u00e7a, Lousal, Neves Corvo and S\u00e3o Domingos mines in the Portuguese Iberian Pyrite \n\n \n\n \n52 \n\n \n\nother); while S\u00e3o Domingos and Chan\u00e7a are located in the SE part of the PIPB (\u00b15 km away from \n\neach other). \n\n \n\nFig. 1 Location of the studied mining areas in the Portuguese Iberian Pyrite Belt (B: Brancanes; Cav: Caveira; Ch: \n\nChan\u00e7a; L: Lousal; NC: Neves Corvo; SD: S\u00e3o Domingos). \n\n \n\nThese mines were exploited in different periods of time, and the size of the massive sulfide \n\ndeposits was also different. According to Matos and Martins (2006a), Neves Corvo present giant \n\ndeposits (> 200 Tg) whereas Lousal, S\u00e3o Domingos and Caveira were medium deposits (5\u201350 Tg) \n\nand Chan\u00e7a was a minor deposit (&lt;5 Tg). Brancanes corresponds to a copper vein structure. \n\nDuring Roman times, massive sulfide deposits and/or gossan from Caveira, Lousal, S\u00e3o Domingos \n\nand Chan\u00e7a were intensively exploited. The modern exploitation started in the XIXth century in \n\nCaveira (1854), S\u00e3o Domingos (1857), Chan\u00e7a (1877) and Lousal (1900), and in the XXth century in \n\nNeves Corvo (1987) (Matos and Martins, 2006a,b; Matos et al., 2008; Quental et al., 2002). \n\nBrancanes mine was only exploited during the XIXth century being closed by the end of that century, \n\nwhile other mines ceased their activity in the XXth century (Chan\u00e7a: 1930\u2019s; S\u00e3o Domingos 1960\u2019s; \n\nCaveira 1970\u2019s; Lousal: 1980\u2019s). \n\nIn the PIPB context, the Caveira, Lousal, and S\u00e3o Domingos mines generate large negative \n\nenvironmental impact, due to the dimension of the areas affected by tailings and by the acid mine \n\ndrainage (AMD) (Matos and Martins, 2006a; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2008), while Brancanes and Chan\u00e7a \n\nare nowadays areas showing a minimum environmental impact, and may be considered in process of \n\nnatural attenuation (Abreu et al., 2011; Matos and Martins, 2006a). \n\nThe climate in these mining areas is typically Mediterranean characterized by long hot and dry \n\nsummers, and winters moderately cold and wet. The average annual rainfall lies between 432 and 500 \n\nmm (INMG, 1990) and occurs mostly in winter and with an irregular shape. \n\n \n\nField sampling \n\n \n\nSeveral sampling areas (n = 31) with ?10 m\n2\n each were selected to include representative soils of \n\neach mine where Cistus ladanifer L. was growing up. These soils were developed on different mine \n\nwastes, mixtures in variable proportions of wastes and host rocks, being considered Spolic Technosol \n\n\n\nInter-population variation on the accumulation and translocation of potentially harmful chemical elements in Cistus ladanifer L. \nfrom Brancanes, Caveira, Chan\u00e7a, Lousal, Neves Corvo and S\u00e3o Domingos mines in the Portuguese Iberian Pyrite \n\n53 \n\n \n\nToxic (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2007). In some cases, soils are developed on schists and \n\ngreywackes (Leptosol; IUSS Working Group WRB, 2007) and can be influenced by adjacent tailings \n\nand/or AMD. Soils are developed on: schists and greywackes in Brancanes (n = 3); schist, \n\ncolluvium/alluvium materials, slags with different ages and massive and semi-massive sulfide ore in \n\nCaveira (n = 7); gossan materials and crushed pyrite in Chan\u00e7a (n = 6); schist in Lousal (n = 2); \n\nschists and greywackes in Neves Corvo (n = 7); and gossan materials, modern slags and pyrite ashes \n\nin S\u00e3o Domingos (n = 6).  \n\nIn each sampling area, composite samples of soils (?3 kg of homogenate of, at least, three trial \n\npoints) were collected in the surrounding of the C. ladanifer radicular system (0\u201320 cm). At the same \n\ntime and in the same sampling area were also collected roots and shoots (composed of leaves and \n\ntwigs) of C. ladanifer plants. Plant samples represent, as for the soils, composite samples of a \n\nhomogenate of at least three plants representing a population of C. ladanifer growing in each sampling \n\narea. \n\n \n\nSamples characterization \n\n \n\nSoils \n\nThe soil samples were air-dried, homogenized and sieved. The soil fraction (&lt;2 mm) was \n\ncharacterized for (P\u00f3voas and Barral, 1992): pH and electrical conductivity (EC) in water suspension \n\n(1:2.5 m/V); organic carbon (Tinsley method); extractable phosphorous and potassium (Egner-Riehm \n\nmethod) and total nitrogen (Kjeldahl method). \n\nThe total concentrations of As, Ca, Cu, Fe, Pb, Mg, Mn, Ni, K and Zn (fraction &lt;2 mm) in soils \n\nwere determined in an international certified laboratory using ICP and INAA, after acid digestion with \n\nperchloric acid + nitric acid + hydrochloric acid + hydrofluoric acid (Actlabs ISO/IEC 17025; Activation \n\nLaboratories, 2013a).  \n\nThe same chemical elements were analysed in a soil extractable aqueous solution that simulated \n\nrizosphere conditions (RHIZO solution; Feng et al. 2005) which contain acetic acid + lactic acid + citric \n\nacid + malic acid + formic acid at 10 mmol/L. These extractable soil solutions were analysed by ICP-\n\nMS and ICP-OES in the same certified laboratory (Activation Laboratories, 2013b). \n\n \n\nPlants \n\nRoots and shoots samples were washed with tap water and then with distilled water. The roots \n\nwere still sonicated in distilled water for 30 minutes. Plant samples were dried (40 \u00b0C) homogenised \n\nand finely ground. The same chemical elements than in soils were analysed by ICP-MS, after ashing \n\n(475 \u00b0C) and nitric acid digestion (Activation Laboratories, 2013c). \n\n \n\nData analysis \n\n \n\nDescriptive statistics was performed in the four sets of data \u2013 total concentrations of chemical \n\nelements in the soils, available fraction of soils, roots and aerial parts of the C. ladanifer from all \n\n\n\nInter-population variation on the accumulation and translocation of potentially harmful chemical elements in Cistus ladanifer L. \nfrom Brancanes, Caveira, Chan\u00e7a, Lousal, Neves Corvo and S\u00e3o Domingos mines in the Portuguese Iberian Pyrite \n\n \n\n \n54 \n\n \n\nmining areas. Measures of central tendency and dispersion were obtained. Principal Components \n\nAnalysis (PCA) in two ways \u2013 the classical method and a second approach with adaptations used \n\nmostly in multivariate statistical process control data \u2013 were done assuming that the populations of \n\nvariables are multivariate normally distributed. To assess multivariate normality Probability-Probability \n\nchart was produced to check the tendency of all variables together to follow the normal theoretical \n\ncurve. In the second approach instead of rotations of the axis in classical PCA, where is tried to \n\nmaximize the highly correlated data and minimize the lowest correlations of data, it is proposed in this \n\napproach the change of the origin of data to the mean. Sometimes it is necessary to change the origin \n\nof data to the mean more than once to have the best fit. The transformed variables are the ratio \n\nbetween, the difference of the original variable and the mean, in numerator, and the standard \n\ndeviation of the original variable, in denominator. This second method of application of PCA was \n\nperformed in this study using the Nonlinear Iterative Partial Least Square (NIPALS) (an iterative \n\nprocedure) algorithm with 50 iterations maximum number and convergence criteria of 0.0001. The \n\niterative method NIPALS used to build the principal components model (find the eigenvectors) for the \n\nrepresentation of multivariate variables X (Risvic, 2007). The number of components was fitted by \n\ncross-validation. Another important difference between the classical PCA and the second approach \n\nPCA is the significance and limit of the principal components. Classical PCA significance of principal \n\ncomponents determines the number of principal components until all the data are explained. This way, \n\nthe number of principal components corresponds to the number of variables. In the second method, \n\nthe limit and the significance of the principal components is based on the method of cross-validation. \n\nThe cross-validation method was V-fold validation. In V-fold cross validation, the data are divided into \n\nv segments, v-1 of which is used to build up the model and the rest is used for testing. This process is \n\nrepeated for all possible permutations of the training and testing segments and the overall Q\n2\n and Q\n\n2\nV \n\nare calculated for the newly added principal component using the test samples. Given the estimated \n\nvalues of Q\n2\n and Q\n\n2\nV, it is possible to determine, whether a principal component is significant. \n\nThe reason for the choice of both methods was that the soil and plant data were obtained in \n\ndifferent mining areas with different extraction of ore volumes, which could impact differently the \n\nenvironment. As was already referred, these mining areas had different periods of mining and one of \n\nthem is still in operation.  \n\nClassical PCA is considered to organize variables in clusters. It is also important to obtain the usual \n\ninterpretations and tests what can be obtained with the second approach. Adding this PCA control \n\nprocess it is expected to extract more information from the data and at the same time, perform a \n\nquality control of the data. This method is usually obtained in the industry to control the quality of data \n\nproduced. Apart from the called \u201cquality control\u201d that it is considered necessary because of the \n\ndiversity of mining areas with different ore deposits extracted in different time periods, it is possible to \n\nhave information from the predictors and from the residuals. Predictors correspond to pre-processing \n\nthe data and with it, predict future observations, and in the present case try to eliminate over \n\nrepresentation of some variables, merely on the basis of, for instance, the range of data. Variables \n\noften have substantially different ranges (i.e., different variances). This may have to do with the units \n\nof measurements or simply the nature of the variables themselves. However, the numeric range of a \n\n\n\nInter-population variation on the accumulation and translocation of potentially harmful chemical elements in Cistus ladanifer L. \nfrom Brancanes, Caveira, Chan\u00e7a, Lousal, Neves Corvo and S\u00e3o Domingos mines in the Portuguese Iberian Pyrite \n\n55 \n\n \n\nvariable may not be a good indication of the importance of that variable. Residuals, on the other hand, \n\ncorrespond to the properties that are not captured by the principal components but that can contain \n\nimportant information such as outliers. These outliers are observed in the Hotelling T2 diagram or D-\n\nto-Model diagram (Distance to the model) where moderate outliers are identified. The degree of \n\nfreedom is given by the difference between the variables number and the principal components. At the \n\nend, predictions for the PC model plus residual variance equal the preprocessed data (scaled) (Hill \n\nand Lewicki, 2007). \n\nThe four principal components (PC) are represented by the lines and from the bottom line until the \n\nfirst, respectively PC1 to PC4. The groups of variables that are correlated with the respective PCs are \n\nrepresented in relation to the respective lines and the contributions are cumulative in the respective \n\ndiagrams. Therefore, the biggest contribution is given by PC1 and the other are added to this one. \n\nFor statistical purposes, the results below the detection limit were assumed as half of the detection \n\nlimit while for the results over range was considered the limit value range. Quality control of the \n\nanalysis was made by analytical replicate samples, use of certified standard solutions and laboratory \n\nstandards at the Activation Laboratories.  \n\nSoil-plant transfer and translocation coefficients were calculated. Soil-plant transfer coefficient \n\n(TransferC = [total shoots element]/[total soil element]), also named biological absorption coefficient or \n\nbiological accumulation coefficient, indicates if the plants can be considered as accumulator \n\n(TransferC > 1) or non-accumulating of a specific element. The translocation capacity of an element, \n\nfrom roots to shoots, can be evaluated by translocation coefficient (TranslC = [total shoots \n\nelement]/[total roots element]). \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nSoil characteristics  \n\n \n\nThe characteristics of the soils collected in each mining area had great variability, depending on the \n\ncomplex mixture of mine wastes or mine wastes plus host rocks (Table 1). The pH of the soils can be \n\nconsidered moderately acid or acid, with values below 4, in areas that uses to receive the influence of \n\nacid mine drainage or where soils have been developed on mine wastes containing sulfides, as is the \n\ncase of the majority of the PIPB mines. The soils of Brancanes had the pH in the range 5.4 \u2013 6.0 \n\nbecause the collected samples were developed on host rocks (Table 1).  \n\nThe high values of the electrical conductivity of the soils from Lousal (> 1.3 mS/cm) is a \n\nconsequence of the influence of waste dump leachates leading to salt efflorescence formation on the \n\nsoil surface in the summer season. The soils were collected near the bottom of a waste pile, draining \n\ndirectly to the place.  \n\nConcentrations of extractable K in soils from all mine areas were in the range considered medium-\n\nhigh or very high (INIA \u2013 LQARS, 2000), depending on mine area. In general, soil fertility in Brancanes \n\nand Neves Corvo was slightly better, compared to the soils of other mine areas, because the \n\nconcentrations of organic C, total N and extractable P in soils of those sampling areas can be \n\nconsidered as medium to high or very high (INIA \u2013 LQARS, 2000) (Table 1). \n\n\n\nInter-population variation on the accumulation and translocation of potentially harmful chemical elements in Cistus ladanifer L. \nfrom Brancanes, Caveira, Chan\u00e7a, Lousal, Neves Corvo and S\u00e3o Domingos mines in the Portuguese Iberian Pyrite \n\n \n\n \n56 \n\n \n\nComparing the concentrations of the studied chemical elements in the soils of the different mine \n\nareas, soils from Brancanes presented the lowest values for the total concentrations of the elements \n\n(except for manganese; Table 2). The same tendency was not verified for the soil available fraction \n\nwhere the concentrations of Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn and K (Table 3) in the extractable solutions were among \n\nthe highest values when compared to the other soils. For the six mine areas, the total concentrations \n\nof As in the soils exceeded the maximum allowed values (MAV) according to the Canadian legislation \n\n(12 mg As/kg; CCME, 2007).Total concentrations of Cu and Pb in the majority of the soils from all the \n\nmine areas, with Brancanes exception, were above the MAV for agriculture use and following the \n\nCanadian Soil Quality Guidelines (63 mg Cu/kg and 70 mg Pb/kg; CCME, 2007). Unlike As, Cu and \n\nPb the total concentration of Zn were below the MAV (200 mg Zn/kg; CCME, 2007) in S\u00e3o Domingos \n\nsoils and some soil samples from Neves Corvo. Nickel total concentrations in all the mine soils were \n\nrelatively low and within the range of the medium values calculated by Kabata-Pendias (2011) on the \n\nWorld Scale for Different Soil Groups and even below the maximum allowed values according to \n\nCCME (2007) for any soil use (50 mg Ni/kg). Soils from Chan\u00e7a and S\u00e3o Domingos presented lower \n\ntotal concentrations of manganese than the soils of the other mine areas. \n\nThe total concentrations of the trace elements in the mine soils were high (Table 2), but the \n\nconcentrations of the same elements in the soil available fraction were, in general, low in all mine \n\nareas (Table 3). Although elements concentrations in available fraction differ according to the used \n\nextraction solution, low concentrations of arsenic, copper, iron, manganese, lead and zinc in the soil \n\navailable fractions were also observed in Caveira and S\u00e3o Domingos (Abreu et al., 2012a,b; Batista et \n\nal., 2009; Santos et al., 2012) as well as in some soil available fractions from Neves Corvo and \n\nBrancanes (Batista et al., 2007). In Caveira and S\u00e3o Domingos soils, the low availability of As, Cu, Pb, \n\nMg and Zn was explained by the association of these elements mainly to the residual fraction \n\n(accounted to solid phases with low solubility) as well as Fe-oxide fractions and, in some soils from \n\nS\u00e3o Domingos, by the presence of solid phases, in the residual fraction, containing As, Fe and Pb \n\n(Abreu et al., 2012b; Santos et al., 2012).  \n\nThe As, Cu, Fe, Pb, Mg, Ni and Zn total concentrations in the soils of the studied mines are in the \n\nsame range than those reported, by several authors, for soils collected from mines of the Iberian \n\nPyrite Belt (Abreu et al., 2012a,b; \u00c1lvarez-Valero et al., 2008; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2008) or for soils \n\nfrom mines where C.

Some populations showed high \n\nconcentrations of some elements in their shoots, as is the case of As in plants from Neves Corvo and \n\nS\u00e3o Domingos and lead in plants from Caveira. In fact, the accumulation capacity for elements in C. \n\nladanifer shoots depends on element and population (Kidd et al., 2004; L\u00e1zaro et al., 2006; Santos et \n\nal., 2012, 2013). Considering all the populations as a cluster, the elements concentrations in shoots \n\nand roots were not correlated to the concentrations of the same elements in soils (total and available \n\nfraction), except for Pb. For the different mine areas, the existence or the absence of this type of \n\ncorrelation vary with soils, plants and chemical elements and, usually, did not show a regular pattern.  \n\nSome authors also reported both behaviours for this species populations growing in S\u00e3o Domingos \n\nmine (Batista et al., 2009; Santos et al., 2012). \n\n \n\nB\n\nCav ChL\n\nNC\nSD\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6\n\nRoots (g/kg DW)\n\nFe\n\nB\n\nCav Ch\n\nL\n\nNC\n\nSD\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12\n\nS\nh\n\no\no\n\nts\n (\n\ng\n/k\n\ng\n D\n\nW\n)\n\nRoots (g/kg DW)\n\nCa\n\nB\n\nCav\n\nCh\n\nL\n\nNC\n\nSD\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120\n\nRoots (mg/kg DW)\n\nZn\n\nB\n\nCav\nCh\n\nL\n\nNC\n\nSD\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n1400\n\n1600\n\n1800\n\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800\n\nMn\n\nBCav\nCh\n\nL\n\nNC\n\nSD\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n\nS\nh\n\no\no\n\nts\n  \n(m\n\ng\n/k\n\ng\n D\n\nW\n)\n\nCu\n\nB\n\nCav\n\nCh\n\nL\n\nNC\n\nSD\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5\n\nS\nh\n\no\no\n\nts\n (\n\nm\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n D\nW\n\n)\n\nRoots (mg/kg DW)\n\nNi\n\n \n\nFig. 2 Concentrations of nutrients in roots and shoots of Cistus ladanifer collected in the studied mining areas \n\n(geometric mean \u00b1 SD) (B: Brancanes; Cav: Caveira; Ch: Chan\u00e7a; L: Lousal; NC: Neves Corvo; SD: S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos). \n\n \n\nThe different concentrations of chemical elements in the shoots are the result of several plant \n\nprocesses, like uptake, accumulation in roots, translocation from roots to shoots and tolerance \n\n\n\nInter-population variation on the accumulation and translocation of potentially harmful chemical elements in Cistus ladanifer L. \nfrom Brancanes, Caveira, Chan\u00e7a, Lousal, Neves Corvo and S\u00e3o Domingos mines in the Portuguese Iberian Pyrite \n\n62 \n\n \n\ncapacity rather than soil elements concentrations in the soil available fraction. In fact, some of the \n\nstudied plants showed higher concentrations of some elements in shoots than in the soil available \n\nfraction. Although Lousal population had in shoots and roots similar elements concentrations \n\ncompared to the plants from the other studied mines (except for Ca and Zn; Figs. 2 and 3), this fact \n\nmay not reflect the real behaviour of the plant population from Lousal because only two sampling \n\nareas were considered for this mine area. Calcium concentrations in both plant parts varied in the \n\nsame range (3?12 g/kg; Fig. 2) however the plants, except those from Lousal, presented Ca \n\nconcentrations (average values) around 6 and 7 g/kg for roots and shoots, respectively. The \n\nconcentrations of this element in C. ladanifer shoots collected in the IPB mining areas (Aljustrel: 5.0 ? \n\n8.9 g/kg; Alvarenga et al., 2004; Rio Tinto: 5.6 \u00b1 3.4 g/kg; de la Fuente et al., 2010) were in same \n\nrange.

(B: Brancanes; Cav: Caveira; Ch: Chan\u00e7a; L: Lousal; NC: Neves Corvo; SD: S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos). \n\n \n\nNeves Corvo and S\u00e3o Domigos plants reached the highest concentrations of As in shoots (mg/kg ? \n\nNC: 13.7; SD: 14.3; Fig. 3) and iron (mg/kg ? NC: 1.8 x 10\n3\n; SD: 1.6 x 10\n\n3\n; Fig. 2). However, the \n\narsenic concentrations in their roots is quite different (mg/kg \u2013 NC: 1.2; SD: 10.1) while for Fe \n\nconcentrations are similar (0.6 x 10\n3\n mg/kg). Most of the plants from these two mine areas showed \n\narsenic concentrations above the phytotoxic limit reported by Kabata-Pendias (2011; 5 \u2013 20 mg As/kg; \n\n> 1x10\n3\n mg Fe/kg), but visual signs of toxicity were not observed. The absence of As toxicity in C. \n\nladanifer can be related to the accumulation of this elements in organic forms within the plant (Batista \n\net al., 2004) and the existence of an efficient detoxification process through of the activity of some \n\nantioxidative enzymes (Santos et al., 2009). Furthermore, the increase of As concentration with the \n\nleaves development from mature to senescent stage in C. ladanifer plants growing on soils developed \n\non gossan materials from S\u00e3o Domingos mine can be considered as a detoxification process to assist \n\narsenic removal (Santos et al., 2013). Regarding As in plants in the other mine areas, two clusters can \n\nbe formed: Brancanes and Chan\u00e7a with As concentrations in shoots and roots lower than 2 mg/kg, \n\nand Caveira and Lousal with concentrations varying between 1 and 9.5 mg/kg depending on plant part \n\nand sampling area. The Fe concentration in roots and shoots in plants populations from Brancanes, \n\nCaveira, Chan\u00e7a and Lousal showed great variability varying between 0.1 and 0.8 g/kg. \n\n\n\nInter-population variation on the accumulation and translocation of potentially harmful chemical elements in Cistus ladanifer L. \nfrom Brancanes, Caveira, Chan\u00e7a, Lousal, Neves Corvo and S\u00e3o Domingos mines in the Portuguese Iberian Pyrite \n\n \n\n63 \n\n \n\nThe Pb concentration in C. ladanifer showed a great variation intra- and inter-populations of the \n\nmining areas, attaining the plants from Caveira the highest concentrations both in shoots (21.8 mg \n\nPb/kg) and roots (109.2 mg Pb/kg). Plants from Caveira populations showed a wide range of Pb \n\nconcentrations but most of the values were lower than 24.4 and 244.2 mg Pb/kg for shoots and roots, \n\nrespectively. One of the C. ladanifer sample from Caveira had Pb concentrations in shoots (153 \n\nmg/kg) that exceed the range considered phytotoxic by Kabata-Pendias (2011; 30?300 mg Pb/kg). \n\nThese plants grew in soils with the highest Pb total concentration (48 x 10\n3\n mg/kg) but not the high Pb \n\nconcentration in the soil available fraction. Considering sample as an outlier, and comparing Pb \n\nconcentrations in plants populations from Caveira and S\u00e3o Domingos, they are in the same range. In \n\nBrancanes, Chan\u00e7a, Lousal and Neves Corvo, the Pb concentrations in plant populations were low \n\nand in the same range, not exceeding 9.6 and 24.3 mg Pb/kg in shoot and roots, respectively. \n\nCopper concentrations in plants (shoots and roots) from Neves Corvo were clearly different from \n\nthose in plants collected in the other mine areas (mg/kg ? roots: 28.3; shoots: 219.5 mg; Fig. 2). S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos populations presented higher Cu concentrations in both plant parts (mg/kg ? roots: 15.2; \n\nshoots: 20.2) than plant populations from Brancanes, Caveira and Chan\u00e7a. These plants had similar \n\nmean concentrations of Cu both in roots and shoots, showing Caveira and Chan\u00e7a a great variability \n\nin their Cu concentrations (mg/kg \u2013 Cav: roots: 4.4?28.8; shoots: 4.8?14.3; Ch: roots: 3.1?58.1; \n\nshoots: 2.7?21.4). The majority of the plants collected in the studied mine areas presented Cu \n\nconcentrations in shoots within the range considered normal or sufficient (5?30 mg Cu/kg; Kabata-\n\nPendias, 2011). \n\nNickel was considered as a nutrient because this trace element has a possible essential role in \n\nplant metabolism (Srivastava and Gupta 1996), however high Ni concentrations have toxic effects. In \n\nall the studied populations, the concentration of this element is below the range considered toxic \n\n(10?100 mg Ni/kg) and within the normal range (0.1?5 mg Ni/kg) for plants (Kabata-Pendias 2011). \n\nBrancanes and Neves Corvo populations showed the greatest variability for Ni concentration, \n\nespecially, for roots (Fig. 2). Regarding Mn, plant populations from the six studied mine areas behave \n\nsimilarly to nickel. However, most of the plants had Mn concentrations in shoots within or even above \n\nthe phytotoxic values (400\u20131000 mg Mn/kg; Kabata-Pendias, 2011) (Fig. 2). \n\nIn general, independently of the population, Zn concentrations in shoots (Fig. 2) were considered \n\nnormal or sufficient (27?150 mg/kg; Kabata-Pendias 2011). Populations from Lousal and S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos presented higher concentration of Zn in the roots than the populations growing in the other \n\nmine areas. \n\nCistus ladanifer shoots and roots collected in different mine areas showed a wide range of \n\nconcentrations for the same chemical elements (Table 4) being, in some cases, different from the \n\nvalues obtained in present study and for the same elements (Figs. 2 and 3).The differences in the \n\nstorage of some elements suggest different processes for accumulation and/or transport mechanisms \n\nwithin plants (Zhang et al., 2002). The differences can be induced by seasonal and temporal variations \n\nin plants and soils (e.g. elements concentrations in the soil available fraction, meteorological \n\nconditions, water regime), as well as the analysed plant part collected (e.g. leaves (young and \n\n\n\nInter-population variation on the accumulation and translocation of potentially harmful chemical elements in Cistus ladanifer L. \nfrom Brancanes, Caveira, Chan\u00e7a, Lousal, Neves Corvo and S\u00e3o Domingos mines in the Portuguese Iberian Pyrite \n\n64 \n\n \n\nmature), shoots (leaves and twigs)) (Alvarenga et al., 2004; Kabata-Pendias, 2011; Murciego et al., \n\n2007; Santos et al., 2012). \n\nThe calculated values of the soil\u2013plant transfer coefficient (TransfC) indicated that the populations \n\nfrom the studied mining areas are non-accumulators of As, Cu, Fe, Pb and Ni (TransfC &lt;1), as was \n\nalready reported for S\u00e3o Domingos plants growing in soils developed on gossan (As, Cu and Pb; \n\nSantos et al., 2012) as well as for some C. ladanifer plants collected in Aljustrel (PIPB) (Cu and Pb; \n\nAlvarenga et al., 2004), and in Tharsis and Rio Tinto mine areas (IPB) (for As, Cu and Pb; Chopin and \n\nAlloway, 2007). \n\nVariations inter- and/or intra-population in the accumulation behaviour of Ca, Mn and Zn were \n\nobserved for the plants collected within the six mine areas. The same variations were already reported \n\nfor the same species from IPB mines by several authors (Abreu et al., 2011; Alvarenga et al., 2004; \n\nChopin and Alloway, 2007; Santos et al., 2012). In general, this species was Ca accumulator (except \n\none sample from Lousal and other from Neves Corvo) while for the Mn plants presented both \n\nbehaviours. Plants from S\u00e3o Domingos and Brancanes were Zn accumulators, but the same \n\nbehaviour was not observed for populations from the other four areas, except one sample from Neves \n\nCorvo and two samples from Chan\u00e7a. The same plants species growing in Rio Tinto mine (IPB) were \n\nmanganese accumulators but  excluders of As, Cu, Fe, Pb, Ni and Zn (de la Fuente et al., 2010). \n\nChopin and Alloway (2007) also reported both accumulation behaviours of Zn in C. ladanifer \n\npopulations from Tharsis and Rio Tinto mine areas, while Santos et al. (2012) observed that S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos plants were only Zn accumulator plants. According to the concentrations referred in the \n\nliterature in order to consider a plant as hyperaccumulator of a specific element (Kabata-Pendias, \n\n2011), none C. ladanifer population is considered a hipperaccumulator of the Ca, Mn and Zn. \n\nThe calculated soil to plant coefficient transfer Caveira, Chan\u00e7a, Lousal and S\u00e3o Domingos mine \n\nareas followed the order: Ca > Mn > Zn > Ni > Cu > As, Fe, Pb. This order agrees with that reported \n\nby Kabata Pendias (2011) for the majority of the plant species, except for Mn and Ni. Brancanes and \n\nNeves Corvo populations presented the same tendency, for the same coefficient except for the Fe and \n\nNi in Brancanes and As in Neves Corvo. The soil to plant coefficient transfer calculated by de la \n\nFuente et al. (2010) for several elements and species, including C. ladanifer, from Rio Tinto mine \n\nallowed to conclude that the general pattern of elements accumulation was related to the essential \n\nrequirements for any plant species, corresponding to macronutrients (Ca, Mg) > micronutrients (Na > \n\nFe, Mn > Cu, Zn) > toxic elements (As, Pb). \n\nAs for the accumulation behaviour, a variation inter- and intra-population in the elements \n\ntranslocation from roots to shoots was observed (TranslC: 0.1?37.9 depending on population and \n\nelement). The same behaviour was also indicated by other author for the same species (Abreu et al., \n\n2011; Alvarenga et al., 2004; Santos et al., 2012). Nutrients were mainly translocated from roots to \n\nshoots, independently of population, due to their important metabolic functions (TranslC: 1.0\u201330.6, \n\ndepending on population and element). The majority of the plants from Chan\u00e7a, Caveira and Lousal \n\nshowed a low translocation of Cu and Fe from roots to shoots, however the concentrations of these \n\nelements in their shoots are considered normal and sufficient. Copper retention in the roots of the \n\n\n\nInter-population variation on the accumulation and translocation of potentially harmful chemical elements in Cistus ladanifer L. \nfrom Brancanes, Caveira, Chan\u00e7a, Lousal, Neves Corvo and S\u00e3o Domingos mines in the Portuguese Iberian Pyrite \n\n \n\n65 \n\n \n\nplants growing in soils with high concentrations of this element can be a tolerance mechanism that \n\nguarantees adequate levels of Cu in photosynthetic parts of the plant. \n\nAlthough Neves Corvo soils had low concentrations of As and Pb in total and available fractions \n\n(Tables 2 and 3), plants from this area translocated these non-essential elements from shoots to roots \n\n(Translocation coefficients of 6.9?37.9 and 1?33.5 for As and Pb, respectively). The high As \n\ntranslocation factor was also observed in S\u00e3o Domingos population, despite the total concentration of \n\nAs in soils of this area was higher (Table 2). However, an opposite behaviour of As translocation was \n\nobserved by Santos et al. (2012) for the same species and same mine area but on soils with highest \n\nAs concentrations than those measured in the present studied soils. \n\n \n\nMultivariate analysis \n\n \n\nThe Principal Components Analysis (PCA) assumes that the studied variables tend to multivariate \n\nnormality. The Probability-Probability chart (P-P) showed that the sets of variables tend to the \n\ntheoretical curve (normal) as a whole. However, when those are separated the same tendency does \n\nnot occur. The diagrams were produced using the elements concentrations in the soils (total and \n\navailable fractions), and in the aerial parts (shoots) and in the roots of the plants. The best tendency to \n\nnormality was observed in the P-P diagrams of the soils. Even so, certain elements (Ca, Fe and Ni) \n\nseem to deviate more than others from that tendency. However, the deviation is more evident in the P-\n\nP diagram for elements concentrations in roots (Fig. 4). \n\n  Probability-Probability Plot\n\n As\n Cu\n Pb\n Zn\n Ca\n Mn\n Fe\n Ni\n Mg\n K\n\n-0,2 0,0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1,0 1,2\n\nTheoretical cumulative distribution\n\n-0,4\n\n-0,2\n\n0,0\n\n0,2\n\n0,4\n\n0,6\n\n0,8\n\n1,0\n\n1,2\n\n1,4\n\nE\nm\n\np\nir\nic\n\na\nl \nc\nu\nm\n\nu\nla\n\nti\nv\ne\n d\n\nis\ntr\n\nib\nu\nti\no\nn\n\nProbability-Probability Plot\n\n As\n Cu\n Pb\n Zn\n Ca\n Mn\n Fe\n Ni\n Mg\n K\n\n-0,2 0,0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1,0 1,2\n\nTheoretical cumulative distribution\n\n-0,4\n\n-0,2\n\n0,0\n\n0,2\n\n0,4\n\n0,6\n\n0,8\n\n1,0\n\n1,2\n\n1,4\n\nE\nm\n\np\nir\nic\n\na\nl \nc\nu\nm\n\nu\nla\n\nti\nv\ne\n d\n\nis\ntr\n\nib\nu\nti\no\nn\n\nProbability-Probability Plot \n\n As\n Cu\n Pb\n Zn\n Ca\n Mn\n Fe\n Ni\n Mg\n K\n\n-0,2 0,0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1,0 1,2\n\nTheoretical cumulative distribution\n\n-0,4\n\n-0,2\n\n0,0\n\n0,2\n\n0,4\n\n0,6\n\n0,8\n\n1,0\n\n1,2\n\n1,4\n\nE\nm\n\np\nir\nic\n\na\nl \nc\nu\nm\n\nu\nla\n\nti\nv\ne\n d\n\nis\ntr\n\nib\nu\nti\no\nn\n\nProbability-Probability Plot\n\n As\n Cu\n Pb\n Zn\n Ca\n Mn\n Fe\n Ni\n Mg\n K\n\n-0,2 0,0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1,0 1,2\n\nTheoretical cumulative distribution\n\n-0,4\n\n-0,2\n\n0,0\n\n0,2\n\n0,4\n\n0,6\n\n0,8\n\n1,0\n\n1,2\n\n1,4\n\nE\nm\n\np\nir\nic\n\na\nl \nc\nu\nm\n\nu\nla\n\nti\nv\ne\n d\n\nis\ntr\n\nib\nu\nti\no\nn\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nProbability-Probability Plot\n\n As\n\n Cu\n\n Pb\n\n Zn\n\n Ca\n\n Mn\n\n Fe\n\n Ni\n\n Mg\n\n K\n-0,2 0,0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1,0 1,2\n\nTheoretical cumulative distribution\n\n-0,4\n\n-0,2\n\n0,0\n\n0,2\n\n0,4\n\n0,6\n\n0,8\n\n1,0\n\n1,2\n\n1,4\n\nE\nm\n\np\nir\n\nic\na\nl \nc\nu\nm\n\nu\nla\n\nti\nv\ne\n d\n\nis\ntr\n\nib\nu\nti\no\nn\n\n \n\nFig. 4 Probability-Probability plot (P-P) representing empirical cumulative distribution Vs theoretical cumulative \n\ndistribution of the elements concentrations testing possible multivariate normality. \n\n\n\nInter-population variation on the accumulation and translocation of potentially harmful chemical elements in Cistus ladanifer L. \nfrom Brancanes, Caveira, Chan\u00e7a, Lousal, Neves Corvo and S\u00e3o Domingos mines in the Portuguese Iberian Pyrite \n\n66 \n\n \n\nFigure 5 shows that the same groups of elements were obtained in PCA and in PCA-NIPALS, \n\nrepresenting the PC1-PC2 axis the available fractions of the elements in soils.

Similar groups were identified on the PC1 of soils available fractions and \n\nplants, although not always in the same sites. In the case of the available fraction of the soils, those \n\nare more related with Neves Corvo mine area. Whereas in case of the plants those are more related \n\nwith Brancanes mine area. There is a strong correlation for Caveira area between Pb concentration in \n\nthe soils available fraction and in the plants (shoots and roots). When observing individual \n\ncontributions (not presented), all samples collected in Caveira are significantly more correlated with Pb \n\nthan with other chemical elements, with special contribution of the sample Cav5. The exception is the \n\ntotal concentration of the elements in soils which have different behaviour. This different behaviour is \n\nexpected, because total fraction of the elements in soils may not be entirely available for plant uptake \n\nand it differs depending on the chemical element (Fig. 6).

for soil total fraction (A), soil available fraction (B), Cistus ladanifer roots (C) and \n\nCistus ladanifer shoots (D). (B: Brancanes; Cav: Caveira; Ch: Chan\u00e7a; L: Lousal; NC: Neves Corvo; SD: S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos). \n\n\n\nInter-population variation on the accumulation and translocation of potentially harmful chemical elements in Cistus ladanifer L. \nfrom Brancanes, Caveira, Chan\u00e7a, Lousal, Neves Corvo and S\u00e3o Domingos mines in the Portuguese Iberian Pyrite \n\n68 \n\n \n\nThere is not much variation in the scores representation in the shoots and roots of C. ladanifer \n\npopulations from Lousal (although two samples are not representative of the population) and also from \n\nChan\u00e7a and S\u00e3o Domingos (Fig. 6). The distal samples of Neves Corvo also show, in general, the \n\nsame behaviour than those referred to Chan\u00e7a and S\u00e3o Domingos areas. PCA predictions for scaled \n\n(preprocessed) data (not presented) confirm some of the previous observations for score axis where \n\nPb is related with the Caveira samples. Neves Corvo and Brancanes plant shoots, specially samples \n\nfrom the last area, show strong variations and important contributions of the elements grouped in the \n\nPC1 (Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, K and Zn). These results were never observed in previous studies of \n\nBrancanes and Neves Corvo (Batista et al., 2007), because comparison among different mines, \n\nincluding these ones, with PCA studies were only possible in this study, when a representative \n\nnumber of samples was finally reached.The similarity between correlations to the axis and variables of \n\nS\u00e3o Domingos, Chan\u00e7a and Lousal is a new observation based on the present PCA studies. PCA \n\nresiduals for scaled data (not presented) show that distal samples of Neves Corvo, Lousal and \n\nCaveira samples (elements concentration in the soil available fractions) are relevant, therefore not \n\nincluded in predictions of the modelled PCs. The same is true for plants, especially roots of S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos, Brancanes and Lousal where a relevant contribution to the PCs was not included in the \n\npredictions of the PC models. This may explain the apparent comparison of the elements \n\nconcentrations in plants from S\u00e3o Domingos and Chan\u00e7a. Previous studies (Abreu et al., 2012a,b; \n\nBatista et al., 2009; Santos et al., 2012) report the low availability of the chemical elements in S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos soils which can also explain those comparison. Batista el al. (2007) reported the low \n\nchemical elements plant uptake, possibly due to the natural attenuation that seems to occur in \n\nBrancanes areas and the consequent soil-plant relationship. However, with this set of studied samples \n\nand the comparison between the six mine sites there is a strong difference in the behaviour of \n\nsamples collected in Brancanes compared with the other samples of soils and C. ladanifer plants \n\ncollected in Caveira, Chan\u00e7a, Lousal, Neves Corvo and S\u00e3o Domingos mine areas. Total \n\nconcentrations of the elements in soils show comparable results with the previous studies where \n\nelements concentrations in soils are independent of the uptake of the elements by plants and the \n\ndifferences observed between samples contributions to the PCs can be explained by the diversity of \n\nmaterials and concentrations of chemical elements in soils/spoils where these plants were developed. \n\n \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n\n \n\nSoils from the different mine areas (Brancanes, Caveira, Chan\u00e7a, Lousal, Neves Corvo and S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos) showed a great heterogeneity of the total concentrations of trace elements, which is \n\nrelated to the diversity of materials where soils were developed. \n\nIndependently of mining area, the high concentrations of the trace elements in soils did not induce \n\ntoxicity for C. ladanifer plants. This species is able to grow in mining areas with soils presenting \n\ndifferent levels of polymetallic contamination. Cistus ladanifer presented variations inter- and intra-\n\npopulations concerning the accumulation and translocation of chemical elements. Whatever the mine \n\narea where the plants grew, nutrients were mainly translocated from roots to shoots while trace \n\n\n\nInter-population variation on the accumulation and translocation of potentially harmful chemical elements in Cistus ladanifer L. \nfrom Brancanes, Caveira, Chan\u00e7a, Lousal, Neves Corvo and S\u00e3o Domingos mines in the Portuguese Iberian Pyrite \n\n \n\n69 \n\n \n\nelements were stored in roots (except Neves Corvo for As and Pb and S\u00e3o Domingos for As). Plants \n\nbelonging to the populations from all mine areas were non-accumulators of As, Cu, Pb, Fe and Ni but \n\nthey were Ca accumulator. S\u00e3o Domingos and Brancanes plants populations were Zn accumulators.  \n\nIn general, the total concentrations of chemical elements in shoots and roots of C. ladanifer \n\npopulations from Lousal, Chan\u00e7a and S\u00e3o Domingos did not present much variation as well as some \n\nsamples of Neves Corvo. The behaviour of the Brancanes plants population, as well the chemical \n\nelements concentrations in the soils where these plants grew, presented strong when compared to the \n\nother mine areas, both for soils and plants. Cistus ladanifer plants from all studied populations \n\ncollected in mining areas, except Brancanes, seem to belong to the same population cluster \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors would like thanks: Jos\u00e9 Correia for technical support; and the \n\nPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) for financial research support of CICECO ? \n\nCentro de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o em Materiais Cer\u00e2micos e Comp\u00f3sitos (Program Pest-C/CTM/LA0011/2011) \n\nand UIQA ?

CISTUS LADANIFER PHYTOSTABILIZING SOILS \n\nCONTAMINATED WITH NON-ESSENTIAL CHEMICAL \n\nELEMENTS \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCistus ladanifer phytostabilizing soils contaminated with non-essential chemical elements \n\n75 \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\n \n\nCistus ladanifer L. is one of the spontaneous species from Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB) considered \n\npromising for phytostabilisation of mining areas. Although the plant\u2013soil relationships of some \n\npotentially hazardous elements (e.g. As, Pb, Cu and Zn) are known, for other elements also potentially \n\nhazardous and non-essential this information is scarce. However, in soils with multielemental \n\ncontamination and for landscape rehabilitation processes, these elements should also be considered. \n\nThe aim of this investigation was to evaluate the potential of C. ladanifer in the phytostabilisation of the \n\nsoils, developed on different contaminated substrata (e.g. mine wastes, and schists and greywackes \n\nor their mixtures) and containing non-essential elements (Al, Ag, Ba, Bi, Cd, Sb and Sr), from three \n\nPortuguese IPB mining areas (Caveira, Lousal and S\u00e3o Domingos). The uptake, accumulation and \n\ntranslocation of these non-essential elements and their influence on the concentrations of beneficial \n\nelements (Co, Na and Se) and major nutrients were studied. \n\nMultielemental contaminated soils from the three mining areas had high total concentrations of \n\nsome non-essential elements (Ba and Sb for the three mines and Se for Caveira and S\u00e3o Domingos). \n\nSoil available fraction of the studied elements were usually small (&lt;8.6 % of the total concentration) \n\nexcept for Cd whose available fraction was between 10 and 100 % of the total concentration (&lt;\n\n0.3?1.3 mg Cd/kg). In general, C. ladanifer showed significant uptake (biological absorption \n\ncoefficients indicating strong and intensive uptake) and translocation (translocation coefficients > 1) of \n\nthe studied elements (even the non-essentials), but small accumulation in the shoots (mg/kg ? Ag, Bi, \n\nSb and Se: &lt;1.6; Ba, Cd, Co and Sr: 0.05?37.8; Al and Na: 49?2503), independently of the mine \n\narea. Elemental concentrations in the shoots were below the limit values indicated for phytotoxicity \n\nand toxicity for domestic animals intake. Although the statistical negative influence of Ag, Sb and Sr on \n\nthe concentrations of the beneficial elements (Na) and nutrients (Ca and Fe) in roots or shoots had \n\nbeen obtained, no visual symptoms was observed in the plants. Cistus ladanifer plants from the \n\nstudied populations can be considered non-accumulators and excluders of Al, Ag, Ba, Bi, Sr and Sb \n\n(soil-plant transfer coefficient&lt;&lt;1) and beneficial elements. Although plants from S\u00e3o Domingos and, \n\nin some cases, from Caveira can be accumulators of Cd, the concentrations of Cd in the shoots were \n\nsmall (&lt;0.2 mg/kg) and did not represent any environmental risk. Due to its adaptability, tolerance and \n\nstandard plant behaviours in the three mining areas, C. ladanifer will be a good choice for \n\nphytostabilisation of soils contaminated with non-essential elements. \n\n \n\nKEYWORDS Autochthonous vegetation \u2022 Portuguese Iberian Pyrite Belt \u2022 S\u00e3o Domingos mine \u2022; Soil \n\nrehabilitation \n\n\n\nCistus ladanifer phytostabilizing soils contaminated with non-essential chemical elements \n\n76 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBaseado no artigo: E.S.

In addition, several mining \n\nareas had significant environmental impacts related to the great volumes of different tailings dispersed \n\nirregularly along the mine areas; high total concentrations of trace elements in the tailings, soils, \n\nsediments and waters; leaching of potentially hazardous elements for adjacent areas by water or wind \n\nerosion; and low production of biomass and biodiversity (Abreu et al., 2010; \u00c1lvarez-Valero et al., \n\n2008; Matos and Martins, 2006; P\u00e9rez-Lopez et al., 2008). According to the above referred authors, \n\nthe abandoned mines from IPB have additional environmental problems because some of their mine \n\nwastes are composed of reactive minerals (sulfides), which generate acid mine drainage. \n\nIn the European Community, the mining accidents that occurred between 1966 and 2000 (Aberfan \n\nin Wales at 1966; Aznalc\u00f3llar in Spain at 1986; Baia Mare in Romania at 2000, etc.) highlighted the \n\nneed for major reforms in mining laws (Scanell, 2012). Nowadays, the European Community \n\nEnvironmental Authorities recognize the requirement to minimize the environmental impact of mining \n\nareas and their wastes, as well as their rehabilitation after closure (Directive 2006/21/EC). \n\nNevertheless, other European Directives (e.g. Council Directives 2009/147/EC and 92/43/EEC) focus \n\nthe importance of the environmental conservation as a whole, or of some key biodiversity groups (e.g. \n\nbirds) or habitats. \n\nIn Portugal, few research programs have been developed on abandoned mines from Portuguese \n\nIPB aiming to contribute to their environmental assessment and monitoring of the contamination (e.g. \n\nMatos and Martins, 2006; Quental et al., 2002; Oliveira et al., 2013; Reis et al., 2012). Whereas active \n\nmines can have efficient procedures of environmental management, the rehabilitation programs of the \n\nabandoned mines, generally focus on public safety. \n\nThe rehabilitation of abandoned mines in the IPB must embrace ecological and economical \n\napproaches. Phytotechnologies are emerging, and are successful in situ tools to remediate \n\ncontaminated soils due to their lower cost-effective and environmental impact as well as easier \n\nimplementation in larger areas, compared to conventional ex situ engineering methods. Among the in \n\nsitu technologies, phytostabilisation is considered the most suitable for rehabilitation of different mine \n\nwastes or soils developed on mine wastes with multielemental contamination and located in \n\nMediterranean conditions (Abreu and Magalh\u00e3es, 2009; Mendez and Maier, 2008; Sheoran et al., \n\n2010). Although the total concentrations of trace elements did not change with the presence of plants, \n\nthe above referred authors mentioned that the establishment of vegetation cover leads to landscape \n\nand soil functions improvement, increase of biodiversity, control of the water and wind erosion and of \n\nthe contamination, by reducing trace elements availability and leaching in the soils/tailings. \n\nAt medium-long term, the success of the phytostabilisation and ecological succession in the mining \n\nareas depends on the knowledge of the characteristics of spoils and contaminated soils, rhizosphere \n\nprocesses as well as the behaviour of spontaneous, autochthones and pioneer plants (e.g. uptake, \n\ntranslocation, accumulation, chelation) (Abreu and Magalh\u00e3es, 2009; Mendez and Maier, 2008; Pilon-\n\n\n\nCistus ladanifer phytostabilizing soils contaminated with non-essential chemical elements \n\n78 \n\n \n\nSmits, 2005). These plant populations are usually specific ecotypes well adapted to mining conditions \n\n(metallophytes) and, in Mediterranean conditions also to drought and nutritional stresses. The \n\necological behaviour of distinct plant species from IPB mining areas has been studied by several \n\nauthors (e.g. Abreu et al., 2012a,b; Anawar et al., 2011; Batista et al., 2007; Chopin and Alloway, \n\n2007; de la Fuente et al., 2010; Freitas et al., 2004). \n\nCistus ladanifer L. is one of the spontaneous species considered promising for phytostabilisation of \n\nmining areas with multielemental contamination (Abreu et al., 2011; Alvarenga et al., 2004; Anawar et \n\nal., 2011; Freitas et al., 2004; L\u00e1zaro et al., 2006; Murciego et al., 2007; Pratas et al., 2005; Santos et \n\nal., 2012). However, the majority of the studies in the field with this species (Abreu et al., 2011; \n\nAlvarenga et al., 2004; Anawar et al., 2011; Batista et al., 2013; Casado et al., 2007; Dur\u00e3es et al., \n\n2015; Freitas et al., 2004; L\u00e1zaro et al., 2006; Murciego et al., 2007; Pratas et al., 2005; Santos et al., \n\n2012, 2014a) focus, mainly, ecological behaviour and plant\u2013soil relationships of some potentially \n\nhazardous elements (e.g. As, Cu, Pb, Zn) while for other potentially hazardous and non-essential \n\nelements (e.g. Al, Ag, Ba, Bi, Se) this information is scarce. It is also important to emphasize that the \n\nknowledge about the plant behaviour regarding these chemical elements, in different substrata and \n\nmining conditions, is scarce despite of its importance for the performance improvement of global \n\nrehabilitation programs. \n\nIndependently of the concentrations of elements in soils, C. ladanifer develops several tolerance \n\nmechanisms, which allow its adaptability to contaminated environments. Examples of this adaptability \n\nmechanisms are: trace elements immobilization in roots, accumulation in senescent leaves, \n\nmaintenance of low concentrations of trace elements in young leaves appearing in Spring, presence of \n\neffective antioxidant enzyme-based defence systems, and translocation of N to young leaves, where it \n\nis reused, during the senescence (Abreu et al., 2011; Alvarenga et al., 2004; Batista et al., 2013; \n\nDur\u00e3es et al., 2015; Santos et al., 2009, 2012, 2013, 2014a). \n\nThe aim of this investigation was to evaluate the potential of C. ladanifer in the phytostabilisation of \n\nthe soils, developed on different substrata (mine wastes, and schists and greywackes or their \n\nmixtures) and containing non-essential elements (Al, Ag, Ba, Bi, Cd, Sb, and Sr), from three \n\nPortuguese IPB mining areas (Caveira, Lousal, and S\u00e3o Domingos). The uptake, accumulation and \n\ntranslocation of these non-essential elements, and their influence on the concentrations of major \n\nnutrients and beneficial elements (Co, Na and Se) in C. ladanifer were studied. \n\n \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n\nSite characterization \n \n\nCaveira, Lousal and S\u00e3o Domingos mining areas are included in the Portuguese IPB, Alentejo \n\nregion, where the climate is typically Mediterranean (semiarid mesothermic). The Caveira and Lousal \n\nmines are located in the northwest region of the IPB, approximately 12 km away from each other, \n\nwhile S\u00e3o Domingos is in the northern sector of the IPB (about 120 km far from Caveira) (Fig. 1). \n\nAccording to Matos and Matins (2006), the massive sulfide deposits in the three mines were classified \n\nas medium (5?50 Tg) being exploited, approximately, in the same time period. \n\n\n\nCistus ladanifer phytostabilizing soils contaminated with non-essential chemical elements \n\n79 \n\n \n\nFig. 1 Location of the studied mining areas in the Portuguese Iberian Pyrite Belt (Cav: Caveira; L: Lousal; SD: \n\nS\u00e3o Domingos) and respective sampling areas. \n\n \n\nDuring Roman times, massive sulfide deposits and/or gossan from the Caveira and S\u00e3o Domingos \n\nwere intensively exploited. The modern exploitation started in the XIXth century (Caveira: 1854, \n\nLousal: 1900; S\u00e3o Domingos: 1857) ceasing between 1960 and 1980 with the abandonment of the \n\n\n\nCistus ladanifer phytostabilizing soils contaminated with non-essential chemical elements \n\n80 \n\n \n\nmines (Matos and Martins, 2006; Matos et al., 2008; Quental et al., 2002). The mine closures led to \n\nsocial and economic degradation in the region. \n\nHigh level of environmental hazard was reported to the three mine areas taking into account the \n\ndimension of the areas affected by tailings, the volume of spoils and tailings, the multielemental \n\ncontamination, and the available concentrations of trace elements in the different mine wastes/soils \n\n(\u00c1lvarez-Valero et al., 2008; Matos and Martins, 2006; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2008).  \n\n \n\nField sampling  \n \n\nEighteen sampling areas with ?10 m\n2\n each were selected (seven in Caveira, two in Lousal and \n\nnine in S\u00e3o Domingos; Fig. 1). These areas included representative soils where C. ladanifer is a \n\ndominant species growing, together or not, with other species of Cistaceae and Ericaceae families \n\nand, in Caveira mine, with sparse tree cover of Quercus suber L.. The soils from Caveira and S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos are classified as Spolic Technosol Toxic (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2007) while Lousal \n\nsoils are Lithic Leptosol (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2007) influenced by adjacent tailings and/or acid \n\nmine drainage. Soil properties depended on materials where soils were developed presenting, in \n\ngeneral, pH values considered moderately acid or acid, low electrical conductivity (except in Lousal) \n\nand variable fertility (Table 1; Santos et al., 2014a). \n\nComposite samples of soils and C. ladanifer (roots and shoots composed of leaves and twigs from \n\nat least three plants) were collected in the Spring of 2010 in each sampling area. Soil samples were \n\ncollected in the surrounding of the C. ladanifer radicular system. Each soil sampling (?3 kg) was a \n\nhomogenate of soil samples from, at least, three trial points located around the plants\u2019 roots at 20 cm \n\ndepth.  \n\n \n\nTable 1 Characterization of soils from Caveira, Lousal and S\u00e3o Domingos mining areas (geometric mean \n\n(minimum \u2013 maximum)) (Santos et al., 2014a). \n\n Caveira (n = 7) Lousal (n = 2) S\u00e3o Domingos (n = 9) \n\npH (H2O) \n4.7 \n\n(3.9 \u2013 6.2) \n\n4.2 \n\n(4.0 \u2013 4.5) \n\n4.2 \n\n(3.5 \u2013 4.7) \n\nEC (\u00b5S/cm) \n179 \n\n(122 \u2013 286) \n\n1849 \n\n(2540 \u2013 1343) \n\n267 \n\n(130 \u2013 603) \n\nOrganic C (g/kg) \n33.3 \n\n(13.0 \u2013 64.3) \n\n4.9 \n\n(3.8 \u2013 6.5) \n\n15.1 \n\n(5.9 \u2013 22.4) \n\nTotal N (g/kg) \n0.5 \n\n(0.02 \u2013 2.7) \n\n0.6 \n\n(0.6 \u2013 0.7) \n\n1.2 \n\n(0.6 \u2013 1.9) \n\nExtractable K (g/kg) \n129 \n\n(58.1 \u2013 324) \n\n42.3 \n\n(41.5 \u2013 43.2) \n\n71.7 \n\n(45.6 \u2013 143) \n\nExtractable P (mg/kg) \n2.1 \n\n(<0.9 \u2013 74.3) \n\n1.3 \n\n(0.9 \u2013 1.8) \n\n<0.9 \n\n(<0.9 \u2013 2.7) \n\n\n\nCistus ladanifer phytostabilizing soils contaminated with non-essential chemical elements \n\n81 \n\n \n\nCharacterization of soils and plants \n\n \n\nThe soil samples were air-dried, homogenized and sieved. In the soil fraction &lt;2 mm was done a \n\nclassical characterisation (P\u00f3voas and Barral, 1992): pH and electrical conductivity (EC) in water \n\nsuspension (1:2.5 m/V); organic C (Tinsley method ? oxidation with dichromate; Tinsley, 1950); \n\nextractable P and K (Egner-Riehm method ? ammonium lactate-acetic acid extractant; Egn\u00e9r et al., \n\n1960) and total N (Kjeldahl method). \n\nTotal concentrations of beneficial (Co, Na and Se) and non-essential elements (Al, Ag, Ba, Bi, Cd, \n\nSb and Sr) in soils (fraction &lt;2 mm) were analysed in an international accredited laboratory using ICP \n\nand INAA, after digestion with a mixture of four acids (Actlabs, ISO/IEC 17025, Activation \n\nLaboratories, 2014a). The same elements were analysed by ICP-MS and ICP-OES (Activation \n\nLaboratories, 2014b) in soil extractable solution that simulates the rizosphere conditions (RHIZO \n\nsolution; Feng et al., 2005). \n\nRoots and shoots samples were washed with tap water and then with distilled water. The roots \n\nwere still sonicated in distilled water for 30 min. Plant samples were dried at 40 \u00baC, homogenized and \n\nfinely ground. In these samples were determined the concentrations of the same elements than in \n\nsoils by ICP-MS, after ashing at 475 \u00b0C and nitric acid digestion (Activation Laboratories, 2014c). \n\n \n\nData analysis \n\n \n\nData were analysed by a one way ANOVA and the Duncan test (p &lt;0.05), using the statistical \n\nprogramme SPSS v18.0 for Windows, in order to identify differences among plant populations. \n\nDifferences between concentrations of the elements in roots and shoots from the same population \n\nwere analysed non-parametrically using Kruskal\u2013Wallis ANOVA by Ranks test. For statistical \n\npurposes, the results below the detection limit were assumed as half of the detection limit while for the \n\nresults in over range was considered the limit value of the range. Bivariate Pearson correlations were \n\nused to correlate the soil and plant characteristics (r > 0.85). Quality control of the analysis was made \n\nby analytical replicate samples, use of certified standard solutions and laboratory standards at the \n\nActivation Laboratories.  \n\nThree coefficients reported by Huang and Cunningham (1996), Brook (1998) and Perelman (1966) \n\nwere calculated to evaluate the potential of C. ladanifer for phytostabilization purpose: Soil-plant \n\ntransfer coefficient (TransferC = [total shoots element]/[total soil element]), translocation coefficient \n\n(TranslC = [total shoots element]/[total roots element]), biological absorption coefficient (BAC = [total \n\nroots element]/[available soil element]). Soil-plant transfer and translocation coefficients have been \n\nconsidered as key parameters of the possible use of plants for phytostabilisation purposes (Mendez \n\nand Maier, 2008). \n\nSoil-plant transfer coefficient indicates the accumulation behaviour of the plant (the plants can be \n\nconsidered as accumulator (TransferC > 1) or non-accumulator/excluder of a specific element \n\n(TransferC &lt;1)). The translocation of an element from roots to shoots was evaluated by the \n\ntranslocation coefficient while uptake capacity was assessed by biological absorption coefficient. \n\n\n\nCistus ladanifer phytostabilizing soils contaminated with non-essential chemical elements \n\n82 \n\n \n\nAccording to Perelman (1966), BAC can be divided in five groups, which indicate the intensity of \n\nabsorption by the roots (Intensive: 10 &lt;BAC &lt;100; Strong: 1 &lt;BAC &lt;10; Intermediate: 0.1 &lt;BAC &lt;\n\n1; Weak: 0.01 &lt;BAC &lt;0.1; Very weak: 0.001 &lt;BAC &lt;0.01). \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nSoil characteristics  \n \n\nChemical characteristics of the soils present, in general, great heterogeneity, which is related to the \n\nproperties of the mine wastes and host rock from which they were developed (Tables 1 and 2). The \n\ntotal concentrations of Al, Ag, Ba, Bi and Sb as well as beneficial elements (Na and Se) in soils from \n\nthree mining areas did not present any significant differences, despite of the variability observed in \n\nCaveira and S\u00e3o Domingos.

In the present study, Cd is the exception, varying its available fraction between \n\n10 and 100 % of the total concentration in the three mine areas.  \n\nRegarding the concentrations of the elements in the available fraction (Table 3), Caveira soils had \n\nhigher concentrations of non-essential elements than those in soils from Lousal (Ag, Ba, Bi and Sb) \n\nand S\u00e3o Domingos (Ba and Bi), whereas the concentrations of Co, Na and Sr in soils from Lousal \n\nreached the highest values. For Cd and Se, no significant differences among the three areas were \n\nobserved for their concentrations in the soils available fraction. \n\nIn general, no correlations were obtained between the elemental concentrations in the soil \n\navailable fraction and the pH, the Corganic concentrations, and the total concentrations of the studied \n\nelements in Caveira and S\u00e3o Domingos soils. Bismuth was an exception because a correlation (r = \n\n0.92) was found between its concentration in the available fraction and the total concentration in soils \n\nfrom Caveira. \n\n \n\nChemical elements in plants \n\nNon-essential chemical elements \n\n \n\nThe concentrations of the studied chemical elements in the roots and shoots of the C. ladanifer \n\nplants from the three mining areas are given in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. Non-essential elements \n\ncan be important environmental contaminants in mining areas causing often phytotoxicity. In the three \n\nmine areas, the uptake (evaluated by the biological absorption coefficient (BAC) calculation; Table 6) \n\nof Ag by C. ladanifer can be considered intense depending on the population. However, the uptake \n\ncapacity of Al, Ba, Bi, Cd and Sr varied between strong and intensive (Table 6) according to the \n\npopulation (plants from S\u00e3o Domingos present mainly intensive uptake), the chemical element, and \n\neven the sampled plants from the same population. Besides these factors, the uptake rate can also \n\ndepend on the soil properties, the rhizosphere effects, the roots system, and the stage of plant \n\ndevelopment (Abreu et al., 2014; Kabata-Pendias, 2011). Cistus ladanifer ability to uptake the non-\n\nessential elements (except for Cd) were high, which according to Kabata-Pendias (2011) is not \n\nconsistent with the tendency observed for the plants in general. On the contrary, Cd seems to be \n\neasily uptake by the C. ladanifer roots as also reported by Adriano (2001) for plants in general.  \n\nAluminium, Ag, Ba, Bi, Cd and Sr were stored in roots having, in the majority of the plant samples, \n\nhigher concentrations than in the available soil fraction, but not higher than the total soil \n\nconcentrations. In some plants sampled in Caveira and S\u00e3o Domingos was still observed that Cd \n\nconcentration in the roots were between 1 and 7-fold higher than the total concentration in the soils, \n\nsuggesting a great uptake and root accumulation capacity of this metal by this species. Plant roots can \n\nchange the pH values of the rhizosphere and exudate compounds that affect availability of the \n\nchemical elements and their uptake by the plant (Abreu et al., 2014; Pilon-Smits, 2005).  \n\nAlthough the uptake and roots storage of Al, Ag, Ba, Bi, Cd and Sr can reach large concentrations, \n\nthe Sb had a distinct behaviour. Thus, independently of the mine area, the uptake of Sb seemed be \n\n\n\nCistus ladanifer phytostabilizing soils contaminated with non-essential chemical elements \n\n85 \n\n \n\nmore or less restricted (uptake considered mainly intermediate; Table 6) and the concentrations of this \n\nelement in the roots were lower than its concentration in the available soils fraction. This fact can \n\nsuggest the existence of a tolerance mechanism (Kabata-Pendias, 2011). Nevertheless, although in \n\nS\u00e3o Domingos population have some plants with strong uptake of Sb (Table 6), no tendency between \n\nvariation intrapopulation and the concentration of this element in the available soil fraction was \n\nobserved.  \n\n \n\nTable 4 Concentrations of the chemical elements in Cistus ladanifer roots collected in Caveira, Lousal and S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos mining areas (mean (minimum \u2013 maximum)).  \n\n Caveira (n = 7) Lousal (n = 2) S\u00e3o Domingos (n = 9) References \n\nNon-essential elements (mg/kg dry weight) \n \n\nAl \n189.6\n\nb\n \n\n(94.6 \u2013 271.0) \n\n273.9\nab\n\n \n\n(254.0 \u2013 293.8) \n\n446.3\na\n \n\n(233.6 \u2013 699.7) \n&lt;100 \u2013 1100\n\n(1)\n \n\nAg \n0.08\n\na\n \n\n(0.04 \u2013 0.1) \n\n0.05\na\n \n\n(0.05 \u2013 0.06) \n\n0.09\na\n \n\n(0.06 \u2013 0.1) \n \n\nBa \n9.0\n\na\n \n\n(5.1 \u2013 21.4) \n\n2.7\na\n \n\n(2.3 \u2013 3.1) \n\n15.5\na\n \n\n(2.6 \u2013 43.2) \n \n\nBi \n0.1\n\na\n \n\n(0.04 \u2013 0.3) \n\n0.02\na\n \n\n(0.01 \u2013 0.03) \n\n0.2\na\n \n\n(0.03 \u2013 0.3) \n \n\nCd \n0.2\n\nb\n \n\n(0.04 \u2013 0.5) \n\n0.4\nab\n\n \n\n(0.3 \u2013 0.5) \n\n0.8\na\n \n\n(0.4 \u2013 1.6) \n \n\nSb \n0.3\n\na\n \n\n(0.04 \u2013 0.7) \n\n0.05\na\n \n\n(0.04 \u2013 0.05) \n\n0.1\na\n \n\n(0.06 \u2013 0.3) \n \n\nSr \n15.3\n\na\n \n\n(5.7 \u2013 29.8) \n\n9.7\na\n \n\n(9.2 \u2013 10.3) \n\n14.4\na\n \n\n(8.0 \u2013 24.2) \n \n\nBeneficial elements (mg/kg dry weight)  \n\nCo \n0.3\n\nb\n \n\n(0.2 \u2013 0.8) \n\n1.1\na\n \n\n(0.7 \u2013 1.4) \n\n0.7\nab\n\n \n\n(0.3 \u2013 1.7) \n \n\nNa \n173.6\n\na\n \n\n(63.9 \u2013 348.5) \n\n212.1\na\n \n\n(187.6 \u2013 236.5) \n\n175.6\na\n \n\n(79.9 \u2013 467.6) \n&lt;100 \u2013 100\n\n(1)\n \n\nSe \n0.2\n\na\n \n\n(0.1 \u2013 0.2) \n\n0.3\na\n \n\n(0.1 \u2013 0.4) \n\n0.3\na\n \n\n(0.2 \u2013 0.5)  \n\n \n\n(1)\nDur\u00e3es et al.

(2015). \n\nInterpopulation variability in the translocation behaviour of some non-essential elements was also \n\nobserved (Table 7). For instance, Caveira plants stored, mainly, Al, Bi, Sb and Sr in their roots while \n\nthe same behaviour was observed only for Ag and Sr in S\u00e3o Domingos plants. The heterogeneity in \n\nthe translocation behaviour can be related to the plant age and transpiration rate of the shrubs (Pilon-\n\nSmits, 2005). However, similar concentrations of non-essential elements (except Cd) in the roots and \n\nshoots from the same population were observed. Independently of the translocation behaviour, \n\nconcentrations of the non-essential elements in the C. ladanifer shoots from the three populations did \n\nnot reach phytotoxic levels (5\u201310 mg Ag/kg, 500 mg Ba/kg, 5\u201330 mg Cd/kg and 150 mg Sb/kg; \n\nKabata-Pendias, 2011) and were below the maximum tolerable levels (MTL) for domestic animals \n\n(mg/kg ? Al: 1000, Ag: 100, Ba: 100; Bi: 500-1000, Cd: 10, Sr: 2000; NCR, 2005). Only some plants \n\ngrowing in S\u00e3o Domingos mine area had Al concentrations in the shoots, between 1265 and 2503 \n\nmg/kg, which exceeded the MTL (NCR, 2005). However, C. ladanifer is not used as feed for the \n\ndomestic animals. \n\nCistus ladanifer shoots from Caveira and S\u00e3o Domingos had higher Cd concentrations than in the \n\nroots (S\u00e3o Domingos: between 2 and 5-fold; Caveira: between 1 and 3-fold) (Tables 4 and 5), which \n\nagree with the high mobility of this element into the plants (Adriano, 2001; Kabata-Pendias, 2011). \n\n\n\nCistus ladanifer phytostabilizing soils contaminated with non-essential chemical elements \n\n88 \n\n \n\nConsiderable translocation of Cd from roots to shoots was also obtained in C. ladanifer from different \n\nproveniences growing in hydroponic solutions (Kidd et al., 2004). \n\n \n\nTable 7 Values of translocation coefficient (TranslC = [total shoots element]/[total roots element]) in Cistus \n\nladanifer collected in Caveira, Lousal and S\u00e3o Domingos mining areas (geometric mean (minimum \u2013 maximum)).  \n\n Caveira (n = 7) Lousal (n = 2) S\u00e3o Domingos (n = 9) \n\nNon-essential elements \n\nAl \n0.7 \n\n(0.6 \u2013 1.3) \n0.2 \u2013 1.0 \n\n1.7 \n\n(0.5 \u2013 3.6) \n\nAg \n1.0 \n\n(0.3 \u2013 1.3) \n0.2 \u2013 1.0 \n\n0.6 \n\n(0.5 \u2013 1.0) \n\nBa \n1.7 \n\n(0.3 \u2013 6.6) \n0.1 \u2013 1.0 \n\n1.0 \n\n(0.7 \u2013 1.6) \n\nBi \n0.4 \n\n(0.1\u2013 1.1) \n1.2 \u2013 3.4 \n\n1.6 \n\n(0.3 \u2013 7.0) \n\nCd \n1.6 \n\n(0.9 \u2013 2.6) \n0.4 \u2013 1.4 \n\n2.5 \n\n(1.6 \u2013 4.7) \n\nSb \n0.5 \n\n(0.1 \u2013 2.3) \n0.2 \u2013 2.1 \n\n1.8 \n\n(0.4 \u2013 10.3)  \n\nSr \n0.8 \n\n(0.5 \u2013 1.1)  \n0.1 \u2013 0.7 \n\n0.8 \n\n(0.4 \u2013 1.5)  \n\nBeneficial elements \n\nCo \n4.7 \n\n(2.1 \u2013 10.2)  \n0.7 \u2013 4.9 \n\n4.8 \n\n(1.9 \u2013 10.6)  \n\nNa \n2.2 \n\n(0.8 \u2013 4.6)  \n0.3 \u2013 1.8 \n\n2.4 \n\n(0.7 \u2013 7.2)  \n\nSe \n1.1 \n\n(0.1\u2013 1.8) \n0.1 \u2013 1.8 \n\n0.9 \n\n(0.5 \u2013 2.2) \n\n \n\nAs for roots, only the concentrations of Al and Cd in the shoots were significantly different among \n\npopulations. S\u00e3o Domingos plants showed the highest shoots concentrations of these elements, \n\ncompared to the other populations, despite of the existence of similar concentrations of these metals \n\nin mine soils (total and available fraction (only for Cd)). The concentrations of the elements in plants \n\nare, in general, the result of a set of plant behaviours, like uptake, accumulation in roots, translocation \n\nfrom roots to shoots, tolerance and synergism/antagonism processes, and can also be independent of \n\nthe concentrations of the elements in the soil (Kabata-Pendias, 2011). Some authors (Kidd et al., \n\n2004; L\u00e1zaro et al., 2006; Santos et al., 2012, 2013) reported that the accumulation capacity of \n\nseveral elements (contaminants and nutrients) in C. ladanifer depends on element and population. \n\n\n\nCistus ladanifer phytostabilizing soils contaminated with non-essential chemical elements \n\n89 \n\n \n\nAs far as we know, there are few data concerning the concentrations of non-essential elements in \n\nC. ladanifer, especially in the roots (Tables 4 and 5). Thus, in spite of the intrapopulation variability of \n\nconcentrations of the studied elements in the roots and shoots of the same species growing in other \n\ncontaminated and non-contaminated areas studied by other authors (Tables 4 and 5), they were, in \n\ngeneral, higher than those obtained in the present study. Although concentrations of Ag and Sb in \n\nCaveira plant shoots were not considered phytotoxic for plants in general, these elements \n\nconcentrations seem to influence negatively Ca concentrations (Santos et al., 2014a) in the same \n\nplant part (rAg = ?0.88 and rSb = ?0.86).  \n\nThe calculated values of the soil-plant transfer coefficient indicated that, in the three populations, \n\nthe C. ladanifer is non-accumulator and excluder of Al, Ag, Ba, Bi, Sr and Sb (TransferC&lt;&lt;1). Same \n\nresult was reported for Al and C. ladanifer growing in the Iberian Pyrite Belt mines (Dur\u00e3es et al., \n\n2015). An exception was observed in one sampling area from Caveira, where the available fraction of \n\nBa corresponded to 12 % of the total concentration (the largest percentage obtained) and the plants \n\nwere accumulators of this element. For Cd, all plants growing in S\u00e3o Domingos (1.1 &lt;TransferC &lt;\n\n18.2) and some plants from Caveira can be considered as accumulators (0.2 &lt;TransferC &lt;3.2). In \n\nspite of the accumulation and translocation behaviours of Ba and Cd, the concentrations of these \n\nelements in the shoots indicate that none C. ladanifer population is considered a hyperaccumulator. \n\n \n\nBeneficial chemical elements \n\n \n\nBeneficial chemical elements can promote the growth or be essential for some plant species. \n\nHowever, the function and concentration vary with element and plant species (Pilon-Smits et al., 2009; \n\nde Varennes, 2003). Some authors report significant growth stimulation for some species in presence \n\nof Na besides its function as osmoticum and counter-ion during long-distance transport (de Varennes, \n\n2003; Pilon-Smits et al., 2009; Subbarao et al., 2003). \n\nConcentrations of the beneficial elements in the studied C. ladanifer roots had slight variations \n\n(Table 4) and were higher than the available soil fractions of the same elements (Table 3). However, a \n\ngeneral tendency of absorption and accumulation of these elements by the plants can be defined (Se \n\n&lt;Co &lt;Na).  \n\nThe uptake of Na and Se (evaluated by the biological absorption coefficient (BAC) calculation) in \n\nplants from the three populations was strong-intense (Table 6). This fact can explain the no existence \n\nof significant differences among the concentrations of these elements in the roots (Table 4). \n\nHowever, Co concentrations in the roots showed inter-populational variability (Table 4), which was \n\nnot explained by the Co concentrations in the soils (Tables 2 and 3) as well as by the differences in \n\nthe plants uptake behaviour. Caveira and Lousal populations showed intermediate uptake behaviour \n\nfor Co while the Co uptake behaviour in the plants from S\u00e3o Domingos can be considered mainly high \n\n(Table 6).  \n\nAs reported for nutrients (Santos et al., 2014a) and Na (Dur\u00e3es et al., 2015) in the same species, \n\nthe majority of the studied C. ladanifer plants also translocated the beneficial elements from roots to \n\nshoots (Table 7). However, the distribution of these elements between roots and shoots depended on \n\n\n\nCistus ladanifer phytostabilizing soils contaminated with non-essential chemical elements \n\n90 \n\n \n\nelement and population ([Se]roots = [Se]shoots for the three populations; ([Co and Na]shoots > [Co and \n\nNa]roots in S\u00e3o Domingos and Caveira plants; [Co and Na]roots = [Co and Na]shoots in Lousal plants).  \n\nThe concentrations of beneficial elements in the shoots and roots presented the same statistical \n\ndifferences among the populations (similar concentrations of Na and Se among populations and Co \n\nconcentrations higher in plants from Lousal and S\u00e3o Domingos than in Caveira; Tables 4 and 5). No \n\nclear tendency between the variability intra- and inter-population in the shoots and the concentrations \n\nof elements in the soils (total and soil available fraction) was observed. Concerning the plants \n\ntranslocation and uptake behaviours, for the same elements, also no clear tendency was observed. \n\nThe variations that can be observed in the plant behaviours can be related to plant response to other \n\nelements or to the chemical elements interactions (synergisms or antagonisms), as well as \n\necophysiological characteristics of each population. \n\nShoots of C. ladanifer collected in non-contaminated areas as well as in other mining areas \n\nshowed a wide range of beneficial elements concentrations, being, in some cases, the results \n\nobtained in the present study (Table 5 and references therein) within the same range. Nonetheless, \n\nconcentrations of Co and Se in the shoots from the three populations were in the range considered \n\nsufficient and normal (0.02?1 mg Co/kg, 0.01\u20132 mg Se/kg; Kabata-Pendias, 2011) for plants in \n\ngeneral. Moreover, concentrations of these elements in the shoots were also below the maximum \n\ntolerable levels for domestic animals (25?100 mg Co/kg and 3?5 mg Se/kg; NCR, 2005). \n\nThe three C. ladanifer populations were non-accumulators of Co, Na and Se (TransferC &lt;1). \n\nDur\u00e3es et al. (2015) also found that C. ladanifer from Lousal, Aljustrel and S\u00e3o Domingos were non-\n\naccumulators of Na. In general, concentrations of non-essential elements in the shoots or roots did not \n\ninfluence negatively the concentrations of the beneficial elements in the same organs. However, the \n\nshoots from Caveira plants showed a possible negative effect between concentrations of Sr and Na (r \n\n= ?0.89). Antagonism interaction between Na and Mn (r = ?0.85, Mn data in Santos et al., 2014a) in \n\nthe roots of the plants collected in S\u00e3o Domingos was also observed. Similar interaction between Na \n\nand Mn was also reported by Kabata-Pendias (2011) for the plants in general. \n\n \n\nDesign considerations for the use of Cistus ladanifer in phytostabilisation programs \n\n \n\nCistus ladanifer can be indicated as a suitable species in rehabilitation of several mining areas from \n\nIPB due to its capacity and adaptability to colonize soils developed on different substrata (mine wastes \n\nand/or host rocks), where co-exist contamination of Ba, Se and Sb (according to values indicated by \n\nCCME, 2007) as well as other potentially hazardous elements like As and Pb (Reis et al., 2012; \n\nSantos et al., 2012, 2014a). Moreover, C. ladanifer shows a good vegetative development and \n\nabsence of visual signs of phytotoxicity and/or deficiency of any elements, independently of soils \n\ncharacteristics where the population grows.  \n\nThis species still has several characteristics/behaviours, which according to Mendez and Maier \n\n(2008) are considered adequate to its use in phytostabilisation programs of soils/wastes contaminated \n\nwith non-essential elements. In spite of the relative small biomass production and the slow growth of \n\nC. ladanifer, this species is a non-accumulator plant (indicated by the soil-plant transfer coefficient) of \n\n\n\nCistus ladanifer phytostabilizing soils contaminated with non-essential chemical elements \n\n91 \n\n \n\nnon-essential elements, have high concentrations of these elements in the roots as well as high \n\nuptake (indicated by the biological absorption coefficient), but low concentrations in the shoots. \n\nAlthough the non-essential elements can be translocated from the roots to the shoots, the shoots \n\nconcentrations are low, below phytotoxic limit, and do not pose any environmental risk by their intake. \n\nNatural attenuation of the contamination has been observed in the contaminated soils of some \n\nmining areas as a consequence of spontaneous plant colonization (Abreu et al., 2011; Batista et al., \n\n2007). However, natural colonization presents, over time, different plant density and success, which \n\ndepends on physical and chemical characteristics of the mine soils/wastes and tailings as well as \n\ncolonizing capacity of the plant species (Valente et al., 2012). This process is slow and can minimize \n\nthe leaching and spread of contaminants at long-term, but not always at short-term (Burgos et al., \n\n2013). According to the same authors, it is necessary a speedy assisted remediation. \n\nThe addition of amendments, namely organic and inorganic wastes, is essential to promote the \n\ngermination, establishment, colonization and development of the pioneer species, like C. ladanifer, in \n\ncontaminated environments with low organic matter and nutrients content, and lack of structure in the \n\nsubstrata materials (Abreu and Magalh\u00e3es, 2009; Wong, 2003). The improvement of the spontaneous \n\nplants individual growth can densify the natural populations. In fact, Kidd et al. (2007) reported an \n\nenhanced in C. ladanifer shoot biomass growing in non-contaminated soils amended with sewage \n\nsludge. In gossan mine wastes amended with a mixture of organic and inorganic wastes, the \n\ngermination and development of this species was significantly improved, without the increase of the \n\nmajority of the potentially hazardous elements concentrations in the available fraction and leachates \n\n(Santos et al., 2014b, 2015). It has been observed a microbial activity increase in the amended \n\ngossan wastes with plant development (Santos et al., 2014b, 2015), which contributes to the \n\nbiogeochemical cycling and pedogenesis. \n\nThe application of amendments mixtures composed of several organic/inorganic residues, instead \n\nof using a single waste, can be more efficient in the rehabilitation process of this type of mining areas \n\n(Kumpiene et al., 2008). Nevertheless, the mixtures of amendments and application rates should be \n\nadjusted to the characteristics of each soil/tailing in order to make a specific Technosol that promotes \n\nand maintains biogeochemical processes along the time (Mac\u00edas et al., 2011).  \n\nAlthough organic/inorganic wastes (from Technosols or not) can supply N to plant/soil community, \n\nthe majority of N comes from N-fixation and its mineralization. In order to self-sustain the \n\nphytostabilisation, the use of different tolerant and autochthones plants species is recommended \n\nbecause they can perform distinct functional roles in the habitat. Hence, the use of plants from the \n\nFabaceae (Leguminosae) family and/or other N-fixing species within the plant community can be an \n\nadvantage in the process (Ahmad et al., 2012; Wong, 2003) when using ecotypes isolated from \n\nmetal(loids) contaminated soils. According to the same authors, the contaminants can reduce the \n\ngrowth and multiplication of Rhizobia and affect the steps involved in Leguminosae\u2013Rhizobium \n\nsymbiosis, what contributes to a lower N fixation.  \n\nTo guarantee a similar ecological behaviour and tolerance to the co-existence of various stress \n\nconditions from mining areas, the use of seeds collected in contaminated areas in phytostabilisation \n\nprograms of heavily contaminated soils is recommended. \n\n\n\nCistus ladanifer phytostabilizing soils contaminated with non-essential chemical elements \n\n92 \n\n \n\nThere are many tangible and intangible economic opportunities (also designated as direct and \n\nindirect values) for phytostabilisation. However, due to its complexity, an accurate economic \n\nevaluation of this technology is very difficult. Several intangible benefits are known, (e.g. carbon \n\nsequestration, erosion control, landscape aesthetics), as well as more tangible ones, like decrease of \n\nthe contamination in the water and surrounding soils and the improvement of soils characteristics. The \n\neconomic valorisation of the improvement of the ecological functions and the identification of target \n\ngroups, which benefit from the mine rehabilitation, is difficult to assess.  \n\nPhytostabilisation programs have low installation and maintenance costs compared to other \n\nremediation options. Several industrial or agro-industrial wastes can be included in a strategy for \n\nwastes valorisation, through the design of a Technosol, instead of end up in landfills (Mac\u00edas et al., \n\n2011). This technology can increase the incomes from non-productive contaminated soils if associated \n\nto species with economic value (Licht and Isebrands, 2005). Different options can be economically \n\nviable for C. ladanifer, as production of pellets, essential oils and extraction of compounds for \n\npharmaceutical and cosmetic. However, it is essential the assessment of the environmental and public \n\nsafety risk of these products derived from contaminated areas. \n\n \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n\n \n\nSoils developed on different substrata from Caveira, Lousal and S\u00e3o Domingos mining areas have \n\nmultielemental contamination with high total concentrations of some non-essential elements (Ba and \n\nSb for the three mine areas and Se for Caveira and S\u00e3o Domingos). However, the soil available \n\nfractions of non-essential elements were usually low what reduce the environmental risk. \n\nIndependently of the mine area and soil characteristics, C. ladanifer colonized the contaminated \n\nsoils showing large capacity of tolerance and adaptability to limiting conditions for vegetation growth. \n\nAccording to the ecophysiological behaviours (uptake, translocation and accumulation) of this species \n\nthat led to the great uptake and roots accumulation of non-essential elements but low shoots \n\naccumulation, and consequently low toxicity for domestic animals and even low intake risk, this \n\nspecies can be considered a good choice for phytostabilisation. Furthermore, its potential economic \n\nvalue can be a considerable income for implementation of this technology. \n\nCaveira and S\u00e3o Domingos mines are in an abandoned state and have great areas affected by \n\nold mining processes, so phytostabilisation technology using autochthonous plant species (e.g. C. \n\nladanifer) can be an attempt to reduce the costs of their rehabilitation.  \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors would like to thank Portuguese Foundation for Science and \n\nTechnology (Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia) for financial research support for LEAF- Linking \n\nLandscape, Environment, Agriculture and Food (FCT UID/AGR/04129/2013), CICECO-Aveiro Institute \n\nof Materials (POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007679 (FCT UID/CTM/50011/2013)) financed by national funds \n\nthrough the FCT/MEC and when appropriate co-financed by FEDER under the PT2020 Partnership \n\nAgreement, and the PhD grant (SFRH/BD/80198/2011). \n\n \n\n\n\nCistus ladanifer phytostabilizing soils contaminated with non-essential chemical elements \n\n93 \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\nAbreu, M.M., Magalh\u00e3es, M.C.F., 2009.

MUTIELEMENTAL CONCENTRATION AND \n\nPHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES OF LAVANDULA \n\nPEDUNCULATA GROWING IN SOILS DEVELOPED \n\nON DIFFERENT MINE WASTES \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMutielemental concentration and physiological responses of Lavandula pedunculata growing in soils developed on different \nmine wastes \n\n99 \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\n \n\nThis study aimed to: i) evaluate the accumulation and translocation patterns of potentially hazardous \n\nelements into the Lavandula pedunculata and their influence in the concentrations of nutrients; and ii) \n\ncompare some physiological responses associated with oxidative stress (concentration of chlorophylls \n\n(Chla, Chlb and total), carotenoids, and total protein) and several components involved in tolerance \n\nmechanisms (concentrations of proline and acid-soluble thiols and total/specific activity of catalase \n\n(CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD)), in plants growing in soils with a multielemental \n\ncontamination and non-contaminated. Composite samples of soils, developed on mine wastes and/or \n\nhost rocks, and L. pedunculata (roots and shoots) were collected in S\u00e3o Domingos mine (SE of \n\nPortugal) and in a reference area with non-contaminated soils, Corte do Pinto, with the same climatic \n\nconditions.  \n\nS\u00e3o Domingos soils had high total concentrations of several hazardous elements (e.g. As and Pb) but \n\ntheir available fractions were small (mainly&lt;5.8 % of the total). Translocation behaviour of elements \n\nwas not clear according to the physiological importance of the elements. In general, plant shoots from \n\nS\u00e3o Domingos had the highest elements concentrations, but only As, Mn and Zn reached phytotoxic \n\nconcentrations. Concentration of Chlb in shoots from S\u00e3o Domingos was higher than those from Corte \n\ndo Pinto. No significant differences were obtained between concentrations of Chla, total protein, \n\nproline and acid-soluble thiols in shoots collected in both areas, as well as SOD activity (total and \n\nspecific) and specific CAT activity. Total CAT activity varied with population being lower in the shoots \n\nof the plants from S\u00e3o Domingos, but no correlation was obtained between this enzymatic activity and \n\nthe concentrations of the studied elements in shoots. \n\nLavandula pedunculata plants are able to survive in soils developed on different mine wastes with \n\nmultielemental contamination and low fertility showing no symptoms (visible and physiological) of \n\nphytotoxicity or deficiency. \n\n \n\nKEYWORDS Iberian Pyrite Belt \u2022 Mutielemental contamination \u2022 Physiological responses \u2022 S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos mine \n\n\n\nMutielemental concentration and physiological responses of Lavandula pedunculata growing in soils developed on different \nmine wastes \n\n \n100 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBaseado no artigo: Erika S.

Over time, the extraction and processing of the \n\nore produced different mining wastes which were disposed in an uncontrolled and irregularly way in all \n\nthe mine areas (Matos and Martins, 2006). As a consequence, significant environmental problems \n\nwere occurring (e.g. contamination of soils and waters and reduction of biodiversity), not only in the \n\nmining area but also in the adjacent areas, due to the chemical characteristics of the mine wastes in \n\nthe PIPB (e.g. acid mine generation and high total concentrations of trace elements in tailings and \n\nleachates) (Matos and Martins, 2006; Abreu and Magalh\u00e3es, 2009).  \n\nMining areas from PIPB become extreme environments where coexist many stress factors for the \n\nplants: high total concentrations of potentially hazardous elements in the soils/mine wastes and \n\nleachates as well as soil water deficit and low soils/wastes pH and fertility. However, some tailings and \n\nsoils developed on some mine wastes are naturally colonized by spontaneous vegetation, which \n\nimproves the physical, chemical and biological characteristics of the substrata and, consequently, \n\ncontributes to the pedogenesis and the natural rehabilitation of the area (Wong, 2003; Abreu and \n\nMagalh\u00e3es, 2009). Although very few species occur only in the specific conditions of the mining areas \n\n(e.g. Erica andevalensis Cabezudo &amp; Rivera), other species (e.g. several species from Cistus genus) \n\nare able to grow in contaminated and non-contaminated areas (Abreu et al., 2012a; Santos et al., \n\n2012) being specific ecotypes. These tolerant ecotypes can be classified as obligate or facultative \n\nmetallophytes having effective tolerance mechanisms (Nadg\u00f3rska-Socha et al., 2013). \n\nIn stress conditions, like metal/metalloid toxicity, several physiological processes in the plants (e.g. \n\nphotosynthesis and growth) can be affected due to an increase of the production of reactive oxygen \n\nspecies (ROS) and their accumulation in the cells. Nonetheless, plants have several antioxidative \n\ndefence responses to scavenge ROS (Pang et al., 2003; Cao et al., 2004; S?omka et al., 2008; \n\nNadg\u00f3rska-Socha et al., 2013): produce or stimulate antioxidative enzymes (e.g. catalase \u2013 CAT and \n\nsuperoxide dismutase \u2013 SOD) and/or non-enzymatic components (e.g. acid-soluble thiols, carotenoids \n\nand proline), which remove and/or neutralize the ROS. Superoxide dismutase catalyses the \n\ntransformation of ROS generating H2O2 (Cao et al., 2004), while CAT is involved in the H2O2 removal \n\ngenerated by SOD (Grant and Loake, 2000). Proline accumulation is a very effective mechanism of \n\nquencher of ROS and redox active metal ions binder but it also activates and protects some enzymes \n\nrelated to antioxidative defence (Tekli? et al., 2008). Thiols are also capable of binding metal ions and \n\nforming non-toxic complexes with metals (Nadg\u00f3rska-Socha et al., 2013). \n\nLavandula pedunculata (Mill.) Cav. (Sin. L. sampaiana (Rozeira) Rivas Mart., T.E. D\u00edaz &amp; Fern. \n\nGonz and L. stoechas L. subsp. pedunculata (Mill.) Samp. Ex Rozeira) is one of the autochthones and \n\nspontaneous species identified in S\u00e3o Domingos mining area (Freitas et al., 2004a), an abandoned \n\nmining area from the Iberian Pyrite Belt (SE of Portugal), however the knowledge about its \n\necophysiological behaviour under contaminated conditions is scarce. This information about the \n\ninteraction between stress factors, in this case the multielemental contamination, and physiological \n\n\n\nMutielemental concentration and physiological responses of Lavandula pedunculata growing in soils developed on different \nmine wastes \n\n \n102 \n\n \n\nprocesses can be useful in the design of a strategy for revegetation of mining areas (Nadg\u00f3rska-\n\nSocha et al., 2013), namely production sustainability improvement and efficient agricultural zoning \n\n(Campostrini and Glenn, 2007). \n\nThis study aimed to: i) evaluate the accumulation and translocation patterns of potentially \n\nhazardous elements into L. pedunculata and their influence in the concentrations of the nutrients; and \n\nii) compare some physiological responses associated with oxidative stress (concentration of \n\nchlorophylls, carotenoids and total protein) and several components involved in tolerance mechanisms \n\n(concentrations of proline and acid-soluble thiols and total/specific activity of catalase and superoxide \n\ndismutase) in plants growing in soils with a multielemental contamination (S\u00e3o Domingos mining area) \n\nand non-contaminated (Corte do Pinto) with the same climatic conditions. \n\n \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n\nSite characterization \n\n \n\nFor this work were studied two sites located in Alentejo region (SE, Portugal): a contaminated area, \n\nS\u00e3o Domingos mining area (SD), and a reference area with non-contaminated soils ? Corte do Pinto \n\n(CP). In both areas, L. pedunculata is a representative species in the vegetation community. The \n\nclimate in these areas is typically Mediterranean (semiarid mesothermic ? Thornthwaite classification). \n\nS\u00e3o Domingos is an old copper mine located in the PIBP, which has been abandoned since 1960. The \n\nfirst mining activities date from pre-roman period with Ag, Au and Cu exploitation, in the gossan. Then \n\nin modern times, exploitation occurred between the middle of XIX century until 60\u2019s, for Cu, S, Au, Pb \n\nand Zn in both the gossan and massive sulfides (Quental et al., 2002). During the several exploitation \n\nperiods, large amounts of mining wastes were produced and spread, irregularly, along the mine area \n\n(\u00c1lvarez-Valero et al., 2008). The chemical characteristics of these mine wastes represent a high \n\nenvironmental risk (P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2008; \u00c1lvarez-Valero et al., 2008). The sampling areas are \n\nlocated within the mine area where soils are incipient and were developed on mixtures, in variable \n\nproportions, of different mine wastes and host rocks being classified as Spolic Technosol Toxic (IUSS \n\nWorking Group WRB, 2007). In the mining area, there are also some soils developed on schists and \n\ngreywackes (Lithic Leptosols; IUSS Working Group WRB, 2007), which are influenced by adjacent \n\ntailings and/or acid mine drainage. \n\nCorte do Pinto area is located about 4 km to north of S\u00e3o Domingos mine. In the sampling areas, \n\nthe soils were developed on schist and greywackes being classified as Lithic Leptosols (IUSS Working \n\nGroup WRB, 2007). \n\n \n\nField sampling \n\n \n\nSeveral sampling areas (six in SD mining area and three in CP), with ?10 m\n2\n each, were selected \n\nto include representative soils where L. pedunculata was growing. The sampling was done in the \n\nspring of 2012 (April). In each sampling area, composite samples of soils (?3 kg of homogenate of, at \n\nleast, three trial points) were collected in the surrounding of the L. pedunculata radicular system (until \n\n\n\nMutielemental concentration and physiological responses of Lavandula pedunculata growing in soils developed on different \nmine wastes \n\n103 \n\n \n\na maximum of 20 cm depth). At the same time and in the same sampling areas, composite samples of \n\nroots (only S\u00e3o Domingos population) and shoots (composed of leaves and twigs) of L. pedunculata \n\nplants (homogenate of more than five plants, depending on the plants development stage) were \n\ncollected. \n\n \n\nSoils characterization \n\n \n\nThe soil samples were air-dried, homogenised, and sieved. Classical characterization of soils \n\n(fraction &lt;2 mm) was carried out according to P\u00f3voas and Barral (1992): pH and electrical \n\nconductivity (EC) in water suspension (1:2.5 m/V); organic carbon (Str\u00f6hlein method); extractable P \n\nand K (Egner-Riehm method) and total nitrogen (Kjeldahl method). \n\nThe total concentrations of Al, As, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, V and Zn in soils \n\n(fraction &lt;2 mm) were determined by ICP and INAA, after acid digestion with perchloric acid + nitric \n\nacid + hydrochloric acid + hydrofluoric acid (Actlabs ISO/IEC 17025; Activation Laboratories, 2015a).  \n\nThe same elements were analysed in a soil extractable aqueous solution, which is composed of a \n\nmixture of organic acids (acetic acid + lactic acid + citric acid + malic acid + formic acid at 10 mmol/L \n\nfor 16 h of agitation) that simulate rhizosphere conditions (RHIZO solution; Feng et al., 2005). These \n\nextractable soil solutions were analysed by ICP-MS and ICP-OES (Activation Laboratories, 2015b). \n\n \n\nPlants characterization: multielemental composition \n\n \n\nRoots from SD samples and shoot samples from both populations were washed with tap water and \n\nthen with distilled water. The roots were still sonicated in distilled water for 30 min. Plant samples were \n\ndried at 40 \u00baC, homogenised and finely ground. The same elements than in soils were analysed by \n\nICP-MS, after ashing (475 \u00b0C) over a 36 h period and nitric acid digestion (Activation Laboratories, \n\n2015c). \n\n \n\nPlants characterization: physiological analyses \n\n \n\nAfter washing, shoot samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at ?80 \u00b0C. Before the \n\nanalysis, shoots were lyophilized, finely grounded and homogenised. \n\n \n\nPigments determination \n\n \n\nThe assay was based on MacKinney (1941). Shoot samples (0.1 g) were homogenised in 4 ml of \n\n80 % acetone (V:V) using a homogeniser at 500 g for 15 min, and then these samples were left to \n\nmacerate for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. The extracts were centrifuged and the supernatant used for pigments \n\ndetermination. The concentrations of chlorophyll a (Chla), chlorophyll b (Chlb), total chlorophyll (Chlt) \n\nand carotenoids were determined by UV-VIS spectrophotometry at 480, 645 and 663 nm using the \n\nequations described by MacKinney (1941) and Kirk and Allen (1965) for chlorophylls and carotenoids, \n\n\n\nMutielemental concentration and physiological responses of Lavandula pedunculata growing in soils developed on different \nmine wastes \n\n \n104 \n\n \n\nrespectively. Acetone was used as the blank. Results were expressed as mg chlorophyll/g fresh \n\nweight and \u00b5mol carotenoids/g fresh weight. \n\n \n\nProline determination \n\n \n\nThe acid-ninhydrin method was used to determine the proline content (Bates et al., 1973). The free \n\nproline was extracted from 0.5 g of shoots in 5 ml of 3 % (m:V) aqueous sulfosalicylic acid. After \n\ncentrifugation, the supernatant was mixed in 1:1:1 ratio with ninhydrin acid and glacial acetic acid and \n\nincubated at 100 \u00b0C for 1 h. The reaction mixture was placed on ice and extracted with 4 mL of \n\ntoluene. The organic toluene phase containing the chromophore was separated and absorbance of \n\nthe developed red colour was read at 520 nm. Toluene was used as the blank. Proline concentration \n\nwas determined using a calibration curve and expressed as \u00b5g/g fresh weight. \n\n \n\nTotal acid-soluble thiols determination \n\n \n\nTotal acid-soluble thiols (\u2013SH) was determined according to Ellman\u2019s method (Ellman, 1959). \n\nShoot samples (0.1 g) were homogenised in 2 ml 5 % (m:V) sulfosalicylic acid, containing 6.3 mM \n\nDTPA (pH&lt;1), at 0 \u00b0C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10000 g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. The \n\nsupernatants were collected and used for thiols determination. The supernatant (300 \u00b5l) was mixed \n\nwith 630 \u00b5l of 0.5 M K2HPO4 (pH 7.5), and the absorbance measured after 2 min at 412 nm (30 \u00b0C). \n\nAfter addition of 25 \u00b5l of 5,50-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) solution (10 mM DTNB, 0.143 M \n\nK2HPO4, 6.3 mM DTPA, pH 7.5), the absorbance was again read at 412 nm after 2 min. Acid-soluble \n\nthiol concentrations were determined using the extinction coefficient (?) of DTNB (14150 M\n-1\n\n cm\n-1\n\n) \n\n(Riddles, 1979). The results were expressed as \u00b5mol ?SH/g fresh weight. \n\n \n\nTotal protein determination \n\n \n\nTotal protein was determined in the supernatant used for quantification of the enzymatic activity \n\naccording to Bradford (1976). Protein concentration was determined using a calibration curve of \n\nbovine serum albumin (BSA) and expressed as mg/g fresh weight. \n\n \n\nEnzyme extraction and activity quantification \n\n \n\nThe enzymatic extract was obtained from 0.1 g of shoots with 10 mL of a 50 mM phosphate buffer \n\nsolution (pH 7.2) containing 1 mM of EDTA, 1 % (m:V) of polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) and 1 M of \n\nNaCl (based on Santos et al., 2009). Extraction occurred for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C, with continuous agitation \n\nfollowed by centrifugation. The supernatant, constituting the enzymatic extract, was frozen and stored \n\nuntil further analysis. Substrate saturation and linear relation between enzyme activity and enzyme \n\nconcentration was previously determined. \n\n\n\nMutielemental concentration and physiological responses of Lavandula pedunculata growing in soils developed on different \nmine wastes \n\n105 \n\n \n\nQuantification of catalase (CAT ? EC 1.11.1.6) activity was based on Chance and Maehly (1955) \n\nand Wong and Whitaker (2003). Solutions of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and 200 mM of H2O2 \n\nwere previously incubated at 25 \u00b0C. In quartz cuvettes, 800 \u00b5L of phosphate buffer, 320 \u00b5L of \n\nenzymatic extract and 80 \u00b5L of H2O2 were mixed. Reaction was started by the addition of H2O2. The \n\ndecomposition of H2O2 was followed at 240 nm for 1 min and the slope of the linear portion of the \n\ncurve relating absorbance at 240 nm with time was calculated (?Abs240 min\n-1\n\n). The calculated slope \n\nwas used to determine the CAT activity (\u00b5mol H2O2 min\n-1\n\n g\n-1\n\n shoots fresh weight) using the ? for H2O2 \n\nof 36.0 M\n-1\n\n cm\n-1\n\n (Verma and Dubey 2003). Specific enzymatic activity (\u00b5mol H2O2 min\n-1\n\n mg\n-1\n\n protein) \n\nwas also determined taking into account the protein concentration obtained in the same extract \n\n(section 2.5.4). \n\nQuantification of superoxide dismutase (SOD ? EC 1.15.1.1) activity was based on the method \n\ndescribed by Sun and Zigman (1977) and Khopde et al. (2001). Solutions of 0.1 M of sodium \n\ncarbonate-hidrogenocarbonate buffer (pH 10.0) and 5 mM of epinephrine (pH 2.0) were incubated at \n\n25 \u00b0C. In quartz cuvettes, 750 \u00b5L of buffer, 100?150 \u00b5L of sample and 150 \u00b5L of epinephrine were \n\nmixed. The enzymatic reaction was started by the addition of epinephrine. The increase of the \n\nabsorbance was recorded at 320 nm for 1 min and the rate of epinephrine oxidation calculated by the \n\nslope (?Abs320 min\n-1\n\n) of the linear portion of the curve relating absorbance at 320 nm with time. The \n\nrate of epinephrine auto-oxidation was calculated in the same conditions but without enzymatic \n\nextract. One unit of SOD was defined as the amount of enzyme required to reduce the epinephrine \n\nauto-oxidation rate by 50 %. Specific enzymatic activity (U/mg protein) was also determined taking into \n\naccount the protein concentration obtained in the same extract (section 2.5.4). \n\n \n\nData analysis \n\n \n\nDifferences between L. pedunculata populations were analysed non-parametrically using Kruskal\u2013\n\nWallis ANOVA by Ranks test, with the statistical programme SPSS v18.0 for Windows. Bivariate \n\nPearson correlations were used to correlate the soil and plant characteristics as well as the elements \n\nconcentrations in the shoots and results of the physiological analyses (r > 0.90). For statistical \n\npurposes, the results below the detection limit were assumed as half of the detection limit while for \n\nresults exceeding the quantification range was considered the quantification limit value.  \n\nThe multielemental analyses (plants and soils) were done by Activation Laboratories which is \n\naccredited with ISO/IEC 17025 Quality System. Quality control of the other analysis was made by \n\nanalytical duplicates samples (for each plant sample and physiological analysis) as well as the use of \n\ncertified standard solutions and method reagent blank. \n\nSoil-plant transfer and translocation coefficients were calculated (Abreu et al., 2012a). Soil-plant \n\ntransfer coefficient (TransferC = [total shoots element]/[total soil element]) indicates if the plants are \n\nconsidered as accumulator (TransferC > 1) or non-accumulator of a specific element. The \n\ntranslocation capacity of an element, from roots to shoots, was evaluated by the translocation \n\ncoefficient (TranslC = [total shoots element]/[total roots element]). \n\n \n\n\n\nMutielemental concentration and physiological responses of Lavandula pedunculata growing in soils developed on different \nmine wastes \n\n \n106 \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nCharacteristics of the soils \n\n \n\nSoils had great variability in their chemical characteristics, especially in the SD mining area. Soil \n\ncharacteristics (Tables 1 and 2) depend on materials where soils were developed. In fact, SD soils \n\nwere developed on a very complex mixture of several mine wastes with or without host rocks, which \n\ncontributes to a great heterogeneity in the soils properties. \n\nThe pH of the soils from SD varied between acid, for soils developed on schist and sediments, and \n\ninfluenced by acid mine drainage, and slightly alkaline in soils developed on mixtures of host rocks \n\nand gossan. The pH values in the mine area were lower than those in the CP area (Table 1). In both \n\nareas, electrical conductivities and N concentrations were small and C organic concentrations were \n\nsmall\u2013medium. However, in one soil sample from SD was measured a high C organic concentration \n\n(125.2 g/kg), which was different compared to the values of the other samples. \n\n \n\nTable 1 Chemical characteristics of rhizosphere soils of Lavandula pedunculata growing in S\u00e3o Domingos mining \n\narea and non-contaminated area \u2013 Corte do Pinto (min \u2013 max; mean).

Although \n\nconcentrations of extractable P can be considered small in both areas (INIA \u2013 LQARS, 2000), soils \n\nfrom CP had 3-fold more extractable P than soils from SD. Soil extractable K concentrations were \n\nmedium-high and very high to the SD and Corte do Pinto areas, respectively (INIA \u2013 LQARS, 2000). In \n\ngeneral, soil fertility in Corte do Pinto was slightly higher, compared to the SD area. \n\nThe total concentrations of As, Fe, Pb, Sb, V and Zn were higher in soils from SD than from CP \n\n(Table 2), while the opposite was obtained for Cr and Mn. Despite of the variability, the total \n\nconcentrations of Al, As, Cd, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, V and Zn in the soils from SD are in the \n\n\n\nMutielemental concentration and physiological responses of Lavandula pedunculata growing in soils developed on different \nmine wastes \n\n107 \n\n \n\nsame range than those reported for mine wastes and/or soils developed on mine wastes from the \n\nsame mine area (Freitas et al., 2004a, 2009; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2008; \u00c1lvarez-Valero et al., 2008; \n\nAnawar et al., 2011, 2013; Abreu et al., 2012a,b; Santos et al., 2012, 2014; Dur\u00e3es et al., 2015).  \n\nFor both areas, the total concentrations of As and Cu in the soils exceeded the maximum allowed \n\nvalues (MAV) for residential/parkland, commercial and industrial uses (12 mg As/kg and 63?91 mg \n\nCu/kg; CCME, 2007). Moreover, all the studied soils from SD can be considered contaminated with Pb \n\nand Sb (160?600 mg Pb/kg and 20?40 mg Sb/kg, depending on land use; CCME, 2007), but only \n\nsome samples are contaminated with V (MAV \u2013 130 mg V/kg; CCME, 2007). The total concentrations \n\nof Cr and Ni in soils from CP were above MAV, but this fact is associated to the composition of the \n\nlithological materials (schists and greywackes) from which they were developed (Abreu et al., 2008; \n\nTavares et al., 2008). \n\nSignificant differences were obtained between the concentrations of several elements in the soils \n\navailable fraction (Table 3): the available concentrations of the elements associated to mining \n\nexploitation (As, Cd, Cu, Pb, Sb and Zn) were higher in soils from SD than in CP soils, while the \n\nopposite was observed for Ca, K, Mg and Mn.  \n\nAlthough soils from SD had higher concentrations of some elements in the total fraction, compared \n\nto the non-contaminated area (Table 2), the concentrations in the available fraction of the same \n\nelements in both areas were small (Table 3) corresponding to less than 5.8 % of the total. However in \n\nthree soil samples from SD mine, Cd availability reached values corresponding to 16\u201329 % of the total \n\nconcentration. For some nutrients (Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni and Zn), their availability was also small \n\nindependently of the area, varying between 0.02 and 11 % of the total concentration, depending on \n\nthe element. However, in SD, the soils developed on mixtures with considerable amounts of host \n\nrocks presented ?20 % of the total Mn concentration in the available fraction. In general, Ca \n\navailability varied between 6 and 23 % of the total concentration in soils from all the studied areas \n\n(excepted one soil sample from SD that reached 49 %). The elements concentrations in the available \n\nfraction of the rhizosphere soils from mining areas depend on the extraction solution (Anjos et al., \n\n2012; Santos et al., 2012). Additionally, the specific properties of the species can also determine \n\nsignificantly the availability of the elements for plants (Kabata-Pendias, 2004, 2011). Small \n\nconcentrations of several studied elements (e.g. As, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb and Zn) in the \n\navailable fraction were also observed in the rhizosphere soils of other species (e.g. Cistus and Erica \n\ngenus) growing in SD mine (Abreu et al., 2008, 2012a,b; Santos et al., 2012, 2014; Perez-Lopez et al., \n\n2014; Dur\u00e3es et al., 2015). Even in the mine wastes from which some of the studied soils were \n\ndeveloped, the available fractions of elements are usually small (P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2008). \n\nIn general, the chemical properties of soils from SD, like pH and total concentrations of organic C \n\nand other studied elements, did not explain the small elements concentrations in the available fraction. \n\nOnly for Zn, a positive correlation (r = 0.95) between total and the available fraction concentrations \n\nwas found. In fact, the low availability of As, Cu, Pb, Mn and Zn in soils from SD is mainly related to: \n\nthe association of these elements mostly to the residual fraction (in the crystalline structure of silicates \n\nor other solid phases as salts with low solubility) and Fe?oxides fraction, (Abreu et al., 2012a; Santos \n\net al., 2012; Dur\u00e3es et al., 2015).  \n\n\n\nMutielemental concentration and physiological responses of Lavandula pedunculata growing in soils developed on different \nmine wastes \n\n \n108 \n\n \n\nTable 2 Total concentrations of the chemical elements in the rhizosphere soils of Lavandula pedunculata growing \n\nin S\u00e3o Domingos mining area and non-contaminated area \u2013 Corte do Pinto (min \u2013 max; mean).  \n\n S\u00e3o Domingos mine (n = 6) Corte do Pinto (n = 3) \n\nPotentially hazardous elements (mg/kg) \n\nAl \n34.4 x 10\n\n3\n \u2013 83.0 x 10\n\n3\n \n\n64.6 x 10\n3\n \n\n66.0 x 10\n3\n \u2013 93.5 x 10\n\n3\n \n\n82.8 x 10\n3\n \n\nAs \n871 \u2013 3180 \n\n1702* \n\n38.4 \u2013 79.2 \n\n57.0* \n\nCd \n&lt;0.3 \u2013 1.4 \n\n0.6 \n&lt;0.3 \n\nCr \n75 \u2013 93 \n\n84* \n\n116 \u2013 157 \n\n133* \n\nPb \n425 \u2013 5300 \n\n3039* \n\n38 \u2013 105 \n\n62* \n\nSb \n73 \u2013 249 \n\n203* \n\n6.9 \u2013 10.6 \n\n8.9* \n\nV \n91 \u2013 183 \n\n130* \n\n66 \u2013 87 \n\n78* \n\nNutrients (mg/kg) \n\nCa \n0.6 x 10\n\n3\n \u2013 3.2 x 10\n\n3\n \n\n1.5 x 10\n3\n* \n\n3.1 x 10\n3\n \u2013 32.9 x 10\n\n3\n \n\n13.6 x 10\n3\n* \n\nCu \n67 \u2013 1310 \n\n543 \n\n48 \u2013 229 \n\n123 \n\nFe \n52.2 x 10\n\n3\n \u2013 118.0 x 10\n\n3\n \n\n90.4 x 10\n3\n* \n\n43.1 x 10\n3\n \u2013 52.9 x 10\n\n3\n \n\n49.2 x 10\n3\n* \n\nK \n7.4 x 10\n\n3\n \u2013 19.2 x 10\n\n3\n \n\n16.3 x 10\n3\n \n\n5.4 x 10\n3\n \u2013 10.5 x 10\n\n3\n \n\n7.9 x 10\n3\n \n\nMg \n800 \u2013 5900 \n\n3000 \n\n4300 \u2013 5900 \n\n5300 \n\nMn \n91 \u2013 504 \n\n277* \n\n1450 \u2013 1980 \n\n1663* \n\nMo \n<1 \u2013 10 \n\n3 \n\n2 \u2013 4 \n\n3 \n\nNi \n18 \u2013 70 \n\n33 \n\n54 \u2013 75 \n\n65 \n\nZn \n80 \u2013 857 \n\n295* \n\n61 \u2013 79 \n\n71* \n\nValues of the same row followed by an asterisk indicate significant differences between areas (p &lt;0.05). \n\n\n\nMutielemental concentration and physiological responses of Lavandula pedunculata growing in soils developed on different \nmine wastes \n\n109 \n\n \n\nTable 3 Concentrations of the chemical elements in the available fraction of the rhizosphere soils of Lavandula \n\npedunculata growing in S\u00e3o Domingos mining area and non-contaminated area \u2013 Corte do Pinto (min \u2013 max; \n\nmean).  \n\n S\u00e3o Domingos mine (n = 6) Corte do Pinto (n = 3) \n\nPotentially  hazardous elements (mg/kg) \n\nAl \n113.9 \u2013 315.8 \n\n169.3 \n\n75.1 \u2013 150.1 \n\n118.1 \n\nAs \n0.2 \u2013 6.0 \n\n2.0* \n\n0.03 \u2013 0.3 \n\n0.1* \n\nCd \n0.01 \u2013 0.06 \n\n0.04* \n\n0.003 \u2013 0.005 \n\n0.004* \n\nCr \n0.03 \u2013 0.3 \n\n0.08 \n\n0.2 \u2013 0.3 \n\n235.7 \n\nPb \n0.1 \u2013 0.4 \n\n0.3* \n\n0.01 \u2013 0.1 \n\n0.04* \n\nSb \n0.1 \u2013 0.6 \n\n0.3* \n\n<0.001 \u2013 0.02 \n\n0.01* \n\nV \n0.02 \u2013 0.1 \n\n0.07 \n\n<0.01 \u2013 0.05 \n\n0.03 \n\nNutrients (mg/kg) \n\nCa \n57.0 \u2013 781.2 \n\n278.5* \n\n558.5 \u2013 >1982 \n\n1215*\n1\n \n\nCu \n0.9 \u2013 22.1 \n\n8.0* \n\n0.3 \u2013 0.6 \n\n0.5* \n\nFe \n135.6 \u2013 489.2 \n\n245.8 \n\n84.1 \u2013 239.6 \n\n187.4 \n\nK \n30.1 \u2013 45.3 \n\n38.1* \n\n50.2 \u2013 91.8 \n\n67.0* \n\nMg \n21.5 \u2013 94.0 \n\n47.0* \n\n197.6 \u2013 269.6 \n\n227.6* \n\nMn \n4.4 \u2013 106.6 \n\n27.7* \n\n83.3 \u2013 206.4 \n\n150.2* \n\nMo \n0.002 \u2013 0.04 \n\n0.01 \n\n<0.001 \u2013 0.04 \n\n0.03 \n\nNi \n0.1 \u2013 0.6 \n\n0.3 \n\n0.2 \u2013 0.4 \n\n0.3 \n\nZn \n3.0 \u2013 83.7 \n\n19.9* \n\n0.7 \u2013 3.0 \n\n2.0* \n\n1\nEstimated mean considering the over range value. \n\nValues of the same row followed by an asterisk indicate significant differences between areas (p &lt;0.05). \n\n\n\nMutielemental concentration and physiological responses of Lavandula pedunculata growing in soils developed on different \nmine wastes \n\n \n110 \n\n \n\nEven in the mine wastes from which some of the studied soils were developed, several elements \n\n(e.g. Cd, Cr, Fe, Sb, among others) are mainly associated to the residual fraction (P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., \n\n2008). However, in soils from CP, the organic C concentrations can lead to the decrease of the \n\navailability of several cations as Cd, Fe, Mn, Ni and V (?0.96 &lt;r &lt;?1.00, depending on the element). \n\nThe increase of the total concentrations of Al, As, Ca, Fe, Ni, Pb and Sb led to the high concentrations \n\nof the same elements in the soils available fraction (0.91 &lt;r &lt;1.00, depending on element). \n\nAlthough soil characteristics as low fertility and pH, as well as the multielemental contamination can \n\nbe considered strong limiting factors for plant growth, L. pedunculata is able to survive in soils with \n\nquite different properties, including different levels of contamination, showing a reasonable vegetative \n\ndevelopment. \n\n \n\nChemical composition of Lavandula pedunculata \n\n \n\nConcentrations of the potentially hazardous elements (Table 4) and nutrients (Table 5) in plant \n\nroots from SD presented great variability being always higher than the available concentrations of the \n\nsame elements in the respective soils. No correlation was obtained between elements concentrations \n\nin the roots and the soil available fraction, except for Al and Cu. For these cations, the increasing of \n\ntheir available concentrations contributed to the highest concentrations of the same elements in the \n\nroots (rAl = 0.98; rCu = 0.96). \n\nIn SD, an intrapopulation variation in the translocation of some elements from roots to shoots was \n\nobserved. The majority of the nutrients (Ca, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni and Zn) were mainly translocated from \n\nroots to shoots due to their important metabolic functions (TranslC: 1.0\u20136.3, depending on the \n\nelement), as was also observed for other species growing in the same mine area (Freitas et al., 2009; \n\nAbreu et al., 2012a,b; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2014; Santos et al., 2014; Dur\u00e3es et al., 2015). Arsenic, Cr, \n\nSb and V were also translocated from roots to shoots (TranslC: 1.0?5.0, depending on the element), \n\nbut the concentrations of these potentially hazardous elements (except As) in the shoots (Table 4) \n\nwere considered normal/sufficient or below the phytotoxic level (Kabata-Pendias, 2011). \n\nThe other studied potentially hazardous elements (Al, Cd and Pb) were mainly stored in the roots \n\n(TranslC &lt;1.0). The storage of the potentially hazardous elements in the roots and their decrease in \n\nthe aerial parts of the plants is considered an efficient tolerance mechanism under metal/metalloid \n\nstress (Kabata-Pendias, 2011), which has also been reported for several species growing in the same \n\nmine area (Freitas et al., 2009; Abreu et al., 2012a,b; Santos et al., 2012, 2014; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., \n\n2014; Dur\u00e3es et al., 2015).  \n\nLow translocation of Cu (TranslC &lt;1) was also observed, but the concentrations of this element in \n\nthe shoots were considered normal and sufficient according to the values referred for plants in general \n\n(Kabata-Pendias, 2011). Copper retention in L. pedunculata roots growing in soils with high total \n\nconcentrations of this element, as is the case of soils from SD mine area, can be a tolerance \n\nmechanism that guarantees adequate levels of Cu in the photosynthetic parts of this species. In fact, \n\nthe first tolerance mechanism in the plants seems to be the avoidance of accumulation of toxic \n\nconcentrations of the elements in sensitive plant parts, preventing their damage effects, rather than \n\n\n\nMutielemental concentration and physiological responses of Lavandula pedunculata growing in soils developed on different \nmine wastes \n\n111 \n\n \n\ntriggering other cellular mechanism of tolerance/detoxification (Yruela, 2005). In SD mine, the Cu \n\nstorage in plant roots is also reported for E. australis and E. andevalensis (P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2014) \n\nas well as in some plants of Cistus species (Abreu et al., 2012a,b; Santos et al., 2012, 2014). \n\n \n\nTable 4 Concentrations of the potentially hazardous elements in the roots and shoots of Lavandula pedunculata \n\ncollected in S\u00e3o Domingos mining area and non-contaminated area \u2013 Corte do Pinto (min \u2013 max; mean).  \n\n(mg/kg) \nS\u00e3o Domingos mine Corte do Pinto \n\nReferences \nRoots (n = 6) Shoots (n = 6) Shoots (n = 3) \n\nAl \n322.8 \u2013 1465 \n\n726.1 \n\n398.1 \u2013 612.2 \n\n499.7 \n\n383.1 \u2013 506.2 \n\n460.7 \n\u2014 \n\nAs \n4.1 ? 23.9 \n\n12.3 \n\n3.2 \u2013 26.9 \n\n14.6* \n\n0.3 \u2013 3.8 \n\n1.6* \n\n5.05 \u00b1 0.36\n1\n \n\n7.73 \u00b1 1.75\n1 \n\n14.2\n2 \n\n1.67\n4a \n\n11.2\n4b \n\n3.60\n4c \n\n0.5 \u2013 1.2\n5\n \n\nCd \n0.3 \u2013 1.2 \n\n0.8 \n\n0.3 \u2013 2.3 \n\n0.8* \n\n0.04 \u2013 0.1 \n\n0.05* \n0.6\n\n3\n \n\nCr \n1.6 \u2013 2.8 \n\n2.1 \n\n1.8 \u2013 3.4 \n\n2.4 \n\n2.1 \u2013 2.8 \n\n2.4 \n\n8.56 \u00b1 2.09\n1 \n\n12.2 \u00b1 0.26\n1 \n\n6.6\n2\n \n\n1.5 \u2013 29.5\n6 \n\nPb \n11.0 \u2013 52.7 \n\n26.3 \n\n5.9 \u2013 53.0 \n\n21.7* \n\n0.7 \u2013 8.9 \n\n3.7* \n\n6.96\n4a \n\n9.21\n4b \n\n3.08\n4c \n\n11.9 \u2013 19.5\n5 \n\n1.1 \u2013 12.1\n6 \n\nSb \n0.05 \u2013 0.7 \n\n0.2 \n\n0.2 \u2013 1.2 \n\n0.5* \n\n0.03 \u2013 0.2 \n\n0.1* \n\n0.52 \u00b1 0.27\n1\n \n\n1.83 \u00b1 0.64\n1 \n\n1.9\n2\n \n\nV \n0.4 \u2013 0.9 \n\n0.6 \n\n0.6 \u2013 1.1 \n\n0.9 \n\n0.6 \u2013 0.8 \n\n0.7 \n\u2014 \n\n1\nAnawar et al.

The \n\nsame was not observed for the population from SD for any of the studied elements. In fact, the \n\ndifferent concentrations of the elements in the shoots are the combined result of uptake, accumulation \n\nin roots, translocation from roots to shoots and tolerance capacity (Kabata-Pendias, 2011). \n\nNonetheless, independently of the population, all plants showed higher concentrations of some \n\nelements in shoots than in the soil available fraction. \n\nFor most of the plants from both areas, shoots had concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, Sb and \n\nV as well as Fe and Pb (except in two samples from SD, which exceeded phytotoxic levels) below the \n\nrange considered toxic and/or within the normal/sufficient range for plants (Kabata-Pendias, 2011). \n\nPlant shoots from CP also had concentrations of Mn and Zn considered normal/sufficient and lower \n\nthan phytotoxic (Kabata-Pendias, 2011). \n\nThe concentrations of As, Mn (except in two samples) and Zn in the plant shoots from SD \n\nexceeded the phytotoxic values reported by Kabata-Pendias (2011) for most plant species, but visual \n\nsigns of toxicity were not observed. Phytotoxic concentrations of Zn and Mn in the shoots seem to \n\nhave a different effect in the concentrations of Cd (r = 0.94) and Pb (r = ?0.93), respectively, in the \n\nsame organ. \n\nPlant parts (shoots, leaves or twigs) of different Lavandula species collected in SD mine or other \n\nmining areas under arid and semi-arid climate conditions showed a wide range of concentrations for \n\nsome of the studied elements (Tables 4 and 5). In some cases, similar values compared to those \n\nobtained in the present study were reported by several authors (Freitas et al., 2004a,b; Boularbah et \n\nal., 2006; de la Fuente et al., 2010; Anawar et al., 2011, 2013). \n\nFor the same species, L. pedunculata, different concentrations of several elements (As, Ca, Cr, \n\nCu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) in shoots were reported for plants growing in Rio Tinto mining region (de la \n\nFuente et al., 2010) and in a serpentine area from north\u2013east of Portugal (old mining area of \n\nPingarela), where the climatic conditions are different (Freitas et al., 2004b). However, according to \n\nthe results reported by the same authors, some plant samples have some elements concentrations \n\n(As, Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb and Zn) in the same range than those obtained in this study. These \n\ndifferences can be explained by seasonal and temporal variations in plants and soils as well as the \n\nanalysed plant part. Moreover, interpopulation variability can exist as reported for other species \n\ngrowing in mining areas (Abreu et al., 2012a; Santos et al., 2012, 2014). \n\nThe calculated values of the soil\u2013plant transfer coefficient indicated that the two populations are \n\naccumulators of Ca (TransfC > 1) and non-accumulators of the other studied elements (TransfC &lt;1). \n\nIntrapopulation variation in the accumulation behaviour of Cd, Mn and Zn was observed in SD being \n\nsome plants accumulators of these elements (TransfC ? Cd: 0.1?15.1; Mn: 0.3?4.8; Zn: 0.2?4.3). \n\nConsidering the calculated values of the soil to plant transfer coefficients, no general pattern of \n\nelements accumulation was linked to the essential nutritional requirements for plant species. \n\n\n\nMutielemental concentration and physiological responses of Lavandula pedunculata growing in soils developed on different \nmine wastes \n\n \n114 \n\n \n\nLavandula pedunculata from Rio Tinto mining region was also accumulator of Mn and Zn and non-\n\naccumulator of As, Fe, Ni and Pb. However, an opposite accumulator behaviour, compared to the \n\npresent study, was observed for Ca and Cu (de la Fuente et al., 2010). In plants of Lavandula genus \n\ngrowing in other contaminated areas (Boularbah et al., 2006; de la Fuente et al., 2010), the \n\naccumulator behaviour, indicated by the same coefficient, depended on species and elements being, \n\nin some cases, similar to that obtained in this study. \n\n \n\nPhysiological characterization of Lavandula pedunculata \n\n \n\nSome species or ecotypes, like L. pedunculata growing in contaminated soils from SD mining area, \n\ndid not show any visual symptoms of toxicity even with elements concentrations in their shoots \n\nconsidered as phytotoxic (As, Mn and Zn). However, at the physiological level, several phytotoxic \n\neffects and consequent responses can occur. \n\nIn general, the excess of potentially toxic elements in shoots can modify the pigments \n\nconcentrations, which are usually linked to visual symptoms of plant disease and photosynthetic \n\nactivity (Pang et al., 2003; Stoeva and Bineva, 2003). Although no visual alteration in the shoots \n\ncolour was observed in plants collected both in SD mining area and in non-contaminated area (CP), \n\nsignificant differences were obtained between chlorophylls concentrations (Fig. 1) in the plants from \n\nthe two areas. However, the same was not observed for the carotenoids concentrations (Fig. 1). \n\nConcentrations of Chla in the shoots were similar for the two populations, while Chlb in the shoots \n\nfrom SD reached the highest values. This fact contributed to the significant differences of the total \n\nchlorophylls concentration in the plant shoots from both populations. Although plant shoots collected in \n\nCP had elements concentrations considered normal and/or below phytotoxicity, a negative effect of Al, \n\nFe, Ni and V on total chlorophylls was observed (?0.93 &lt;r &lt;?0.99, depending on the element), \n\npossibly due to the low tolerance of this population to those chemical elements. Moreover, Al \n\nconcentrations in plant shoots from CP also seem to negatively affect the Chlb concentration (r = \n\n?1.00). The decrease of the chlorophyll content in the shoots from plants collected in the non-\n\ncontaminated area can be related to the inhibition of the synthesis of photosynthetic pigments and/or \n\nenzymes responsible for chlorophyll biosynthesis as well as chlorophyll degradation by the increase of \n\nchlorophyllase activity (Sharma and Dubey, 2005). \n\nThe chlorophyll ratio, used as a stress indicator (Zengin and Munzuroglu, 2005), was high in the \n\nplant shoots from CP (SD: 1.2?1.7; CP: 1.7?1.9) suggesting the existence of plant stress. In fact, the \n\nincrease of the chlorophyll ratio due to oxidative stress has been reported in Phaseolus vulgaris L. \n\nwith the application of increasing doses of Cd, Cu and Pb in controlled conditions (Zengin and \n\nMunzuroglu, 2005).  \n\nProtein contents in plants are also affected by the high concentrations of potentially toxic elements \n\nin plants, as a result of the reduction of its biosynthesis or the acceleration of its degradation (Stoeva \n\nand Bineva, 2003). However, in the present study, similar concentrations of total protein were obtained \n\nin the two L. pedunculata populations (Table 6). \n\n\n\nMutielemental concentration and physiological responses of Lavandula pedunculata growing in soils developed on different \nmine wastes \n\n115 \n\n \n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nSD CP\n\nC\na\nro\n\nte\nn\n\no\nid\n\ns\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n(m\nm\n\no\nl/\n\ng\n F\n\nW\n)\n\n*\n\n*\n\n+\n\n+\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\nC\nh\n\no\nro\n\np\nh\n\ny\nll\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/g\n\n F\nW\n\n)\n\nChl b Chl a\n\n \n\nFig. 1 Concentration of chlorophyll (total, a and b) and carotenoids in Lavandula pedunculata shoots collected in \n\nS\u00e3o Domingos mine area (SD) and non-contaminated area \u2013 Corte do Pinto (CP) (mean \u00b1 SD; n = 6 and 3, \n\nrespectively).Values followed by the following symbols indicate significant differences between the populations (p \n\n&lt;0.05): total chlorophyll (*), chlorophyll a (++), chlorophyll b (+) and carotenoids (\u2022). \n\n \n\nUnder oxidative stress, plants can increase the activities of non-enzymatic components as \n\nresponse to the scavenging of ROS (Pang et al., 2003; Cao et al., 2004).

Similar proline contents were also \n\nobtained in Cardaminopsis arenosa (L.) Hayek leaves growing in some metalliferous and non-\n\ncontaminated areas, both from southern of Poland (Nadg\u00f3rska-Socha et al., 2013). However, \n\naccording to the same authors, Plantago lanceolata L. leaves from the same contaminated area had \n\nlower proline concentrations than those from the non-contaminated area.

(2013) and Nadg\u00f3rska-Socha et al. \n\n(2013), which are not in agreement with the findings in the present study (Table 6). Comparing both \n\ncontaminated and non-contaminated areas, it was noticed by Kandziora-Ciupa et al. (2013) an \n\nincrease of the thiols concentrations in the leaves of V. myrtillus growing in the contaminated area. \n\nUnder oxidative stress, plants can also produce or stimulate the activity of antioxidative enzymes \n\nthat remove and neutralize ROS (Pang et al., 2003; Mishra et al., 2006). In the shoot samples of L. \n\npedunculata, the activities of SOD and CAT followed different patterns (Table 6). Independently of the \n\nplant population, no variation was observed in the total and specific SOD activities in the shoots. A \n\nsimilar result was reported by Santos et al. (2009) for mature leaves of C. ladanifer also collected in \n\nSD mine and Pomar\u00e3o (non-contaminated area near the mine area) and same sampling period \n\n(Spring). Superoxide dismutase activities in C. arenosa, P. lanceolata and Viola tricolor L. depend on \n\npopulation, however in some cases similar enzymatic activities were also obtained for plants collected \n\nin contaminated and non-contaminated sites (S?omka et al., 2008; Nadg\u00f3rska-Socha et al., 2013).  \n\n\n\nMutielemental concentration and physiological responses of Lavandula pedunculata growing in soils developed on different \nmine wastes \n\n117 \n\n \n\nThe levels of the total activity of CAT enzyme varied with plant population (Table 6) attaining the \n\nlowest values in the shoots from SD plants. However, the specific CAT activity was similar owing to \n\nthe high protein content in the plants from CP. This indicates that CAT synthesis did not follow total \n\nprotein synthesis. The lower total activity of CAT in the shoots from SD was not correlated to the \n\nphytotoxic concentrations of As, Mn and Zn in the same organ, or even the concentrations of other \n\nstudied elements. In natural conditions, non-specific stress responses of L. pedunculata from SD can \n\nbe explained by the co-existence of different stress factors like high concentrations of several \n\nelements in the shoots, water deficiency and high intensity of UV radiation. \n\nThe total activity of CAT in the shoots from CP was affected by Mn concentrations in the same \n\norgan (r = ?0.93). Although concentration of this metal in the shoots is considered sufficient and below \n\nphytotoxicity, the tolerance of this population can be different compared to SD population. In general, \n\nthe activity of antioxidative enzymes only increases until tolerable elements contents and, when \n\nelements concentrations exceed this level a subsequent decrease of enzymes activity occurs (Cao et \n\nal., 2004). \n\nLow CAT activity was also observed in young leaves of C. ladanifer collected in SD mine, \n\ncompared to leaves from a non-contaminated area (Santos et al., 2009). On the contrary, CAT activity \n\nin V. tricolor leaves from contaminated heaps was higher than in control (non-contaminated area) \n\n(S?omka et al., 2008). The increase of CAT activity was also observed in leaves of V. zizanioides \n\ngrowing in tailings with different proportions of Pb/Zn (Pang et al., 2003). \n\nThe response of antioxidant mechanisms to phytotoxic concentrations of elements depends on the \n\nlevel of free radicals resulting from the balance between their production and scavenging. So, L. \n\npedunculata growing in multielemental contaminated soils accumulate phytotoxic concentrations of \n\nAs, Mn and Zn in shoots but these elements seem to be efficiently compartmentalized into cellular \n\nparts where it is not necessary to trigger an antioxidative response. Additionally, populations from SD \n\nmining area can have higher tolerance range to potentially hazardous elements. \n\n \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n\n \n\nIn S\u00e3o Domingos mining area, the soils developed on different mine wastes showed a great \n\nheterogeneity of their chemical characteristics. Independently of the substrata, Lavandula pedunculata \n\nis able to grow in soils containing different levels of multielemental contamination, low fertility and a \n\nwide range of pH. Nonetheless, the plants did not show any visible symptoms of phytotoxicity and/or \n\nnutritional deficiency. \n\nLavandula pedunculata showed inter- and intrapopulation variation in the concentrations of the \n\nstudied elements in the shoots. Populations of S\u00e3o Domingos and Corte do Pinto (non-contaminated \n\narea) were accumulators of Ca and non-accumulators of the other studied elements. But some \n\nintrapopulation variation in the accumulation behaviour of Cd, Mn and Zn was observed in S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos plants. \n\nThe tolerance of S\u00e3o Domingos population to potentially hazardous elements seem to be firstly \n\nrelated to elements storage in roots, preventing their translocation to the photosynthetic tissues, rather \n\n\n\nMutielemental concentration and physiological responses of Lavandula pedunculata growing in soils developed on different \nmine wastes \n\n \n118 \n\n \n\nthan intracellular production of non-enzymatic compounds and activity of antioxidative enzymes. In \n\nfact, phytotoxic concentrations of As, Mn and Zn in the shoots from S\u00e3o Domingos plants did not \n\naffect the concentrations of pigments and total protein, and trigger antioxidative mechanisms by \n\nenzymatic and non-enzymatic components. The lowest tolerance of Corte do Pinto population, \n\ncompared to S\u00e3o Domingos, can also be noticed by the reduction of the total chlorophylls and Chlb \n\nconcentrations even in the presence of concentrations of some elements (e.g. Al, Fe, Ni and V) in the \n\nshoots below phytotoxic level. \n\nOverall, these results reveal that L. pedunculata has potential for phytostabilisation of soils with \n\nmutielemental contamination under Mediterranean conditions. However, to ensure a similar ecological \n\nbehaviour of the plants and their tolerance to the co-existence of several stress factors, the use of \n\nseeds collected in the mining areas in phytostabilisation programs is recommended. \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors would like thanks: Jos\u00e9 Correia for technical support; and the \n\nPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) for PhD grant (SFRH/BD/80198/2011). \n\nThis work was developed in the scope of the projects: LEAF?Instituto Superior de Agronomia, \n\nUniversidade de Lisboa (FCT-UID/AGR/04129/2013) and QOPNA?Universidade de Aveiro (FCT-\n\nUID/QUI/00062/2013), both financed by the FCT/MECthroughnational funds and, where applicable, \n\nco-financed by the FEDER within thePT2020 Partnership Agreement. \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\nAbreu, M.M., Magalh\u00e3es, M.C.F., 2009.

COMPOSITION AND AROMATIC PROFILE OF \n\nEXTRACTS FROM CISTUS LADANIFER AND \n\nLAVANDULA PEDUNCULATA GROWING IN S\u00c3O \n\nDOMINGOS MINING AREA \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nComposition and aromatic profile of extracts from Cistus ladanifer and Lavandula pedunculata growing in S\u00e3o Domingos mining \narea \n\n125 \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\n \n\nThe aims of this study were to: i) characterize the phytochemical profile of the different extracts (water \n\nand hexane) from shoots of Lavandula pedunculata and Cistus ladanifer growing in soils from S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos mining area and a control area in the same climatic conditions; ii) quantify some of the \n\nmajor components of these extracts; and iii) evaluate the influence of potentially hazardous elements \n\naccumulated in the aerial part of the plants on the quality of plant-based products (aqueous and \n\nhexane extracts). Composite samples of soils, developed on mine wastes and/or host rocks, as well \n\nas shoots of L. pedunculata and C. ladanifer were collected in S\u00e3o Domingos mine (SE of Portugal) \n\nand in a reference area with non-contaminated soils (Corte do Pinto)  \n\nTotal concentrations of potentially hazardous elements (Al, As, Cr, Cu, Mn, Sb and Zn) in soils, shoots \n\nand L. pedunculata infusions were determined. The extracts from C. ladanifer and L. pedunculata \n\nshoots were obtained by an accelerated solvent extractor, and the compounds were analysed by GC-\n\nMS. Extracts of both species were extracted with hexane (single extraction), while L. pedunculata was \n\nalso subjected to a sequential extraction with water and hexane. Major components in all extracts \n\nwere quantified.  \n\nSoils from S\u00e3o Domingos can be considered contaminated with As, Cu, Pb and Sb. In general, \n\nconcentrations of the studied elements in shoots of both species (excepted Cr and Mn in L. \n\npedunculata and Cr in C. ladanifer) collected in S\u00e3o Domingos mining area were higher than in plant \n\nshoots from non-contaminated area. Only concentrations of Zn in the infusions done with S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos plants were significantly different. However, in general, concentrations of potentially \n\nhazardous elements in infusions were small. The major component in the C. ladanifer extracts was \n\nviridiflorol, while in L. pedunculata extracts was camphor, independently of the sample. Extraction \n\nmethod (single and sequential) and solvent did not affect the major components identified in the L. \n\npedunculata extracts. However, for other compounds an influence of the solvent used in their \n\nextraction was observed. In both species, slight variability intra and interpopulation was observed in \n\nthe qualitative composition and concentrations of major components, but no relationship was found \n\nbetween these components and the concentrations of the studied potentially hazardous elements in \n\nshoots. Extracts obtained from C. ladanifer and L. pedunculata growing in S\u00e3o Domingos mining area \n\nhad valuable compounds. \n\nHigh concentrations of potentially hazardous elements in soils did not affect the quality of the plant-\n\nbased products. Phytostabilisation of mining areas with these species can provide economic return by \n\nthe exploration of these products. \n\n \n\nKEYWORDS Camphor \u2022 Lavander infusion \u2022 Potentially hazardous elements \u2022 S\u00e3o Domingos mine \u2022 \n\nValuable extracts \u2022 Viridiflorol \n\n\n\nComposition and aromatic profile of extracts from Cistus ladanifer and Lavandula pedunculata growing in S\u00e3o Domingos mining \narea \n\n \n126 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBaseado no artigo a submeter \u00e0 revista Industrial Crops and Products: Erika S.

Generally, these mine wastes and the \n\nadjacent soils, as well as soils developed on mine wastes have unfavourable characteristics to plant \n\ndevelopment, namely low fertility and high total concentrations of potentially hazardous elements, \n\nsmall water holding capacity and weak structure (Abreu and Magalh\u00e3es, 2009; Wong, 2003). \n\nHowever, some autochthones plant species with refereed aromatic and medicinal properties (e.g. \n\nRosmarinus officinalis and some species of the genus Cistus, Lavandula and Erica) are able to \n\nnaturally colonize these substrata improving their physical, chemical and biological characteristics \n\nand, consequently, contributing to the natural rehabilitation of the mining area (Abreu and Magalh\u00e3es, \n\n2009; Abreu et al., 2008, 2012a,b; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2014; Santos et al., 2014). These species also \n\ngrow in non-contaminated areas, being the populations from the mining areas considered specific \n\ntolerant ecotypes, which developed effective tolerance mechanisms (Abreu et al. 2012a; Santos et al., \n\n2009, 2012). \n\nContinuous degradation of land resources by mining activities can reduce the agricultural areas, \n\nwhile the rehabilitation of mining areas is essential and a priority because those are sources of \n\ncontamination and environmental and health risk. The rehabilitation of abandoned mines by \n\nphytostabilisation involves several ecological improvements (Abreu and Magalh\u00e3es, 2009; Mendez \n\nand Maier, 2008) but, nowadays, the economical approaches are also essential. Thus, the \n\nrehabilitation of non-productive and contaminated soils/mine wastes can be a niche for \n\nagriculture/forestry exploration, by implementation of phytostabilisation, in order to produce plant-\n\nbased products. In fact, the growth of aromatic and medicinal crops (e.g. Anethum graveolens L., \n\nMentha x piperita L., Ocimum basilicum L. and Lavandula angustifolia Mill.) on agricultural soils \n\nenriched with Cd, Cu and Pb is considered an economic and environmental feasible option \n\n(Zheljazkov and Nielsen, 1996; Zheljazkov et al., 2006, 2008). According to the same authors, the \n\nessential oil yield can be reduced with the plant growth on contaminated soils and consequently \n\nincrease of potentially hazardous elements in shoots but, in the process of the oil extraction, these \n\nelements remain in the extracted plant residues limiting their quantities in the commercial oil product. \n\nSeveral plants extracts are used for perfumery, pharmaceutical and cosmetics as well as food \n\naddictive (Raut and Karuppayil, 2014). Cistus ladanifer L. is reported by its medicinal (e.g. antioxidant, \n\nantifungal, antibacterial, antidiarrheic and anti-inflammatory) (Andrade et al., 2009; Attaguile et al., \n\n2000; Barros et al., 2013; Greche et al., 2009; Zidane et al., 2013) and odoriferous importance for \n\nfragrance industry (Gomes et al., 2005; Teixeira et al., 2007). The essential oil of this species also \n\nshowed herbicidal activity in vitro bioassays presenting great potential as natural herbicide for crop \n\nprotection (Verdeguer et al., 2011). Nevertheless, C. ladanifer is a very poorly exploited species in \n\nPortugal although in France and Spain markets have great importance. The use of Lavandula species \n\nas aromatic, for food and fragrance industries, and medicinal (e.g. anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, \n\n\n\nComposition and aromatic profile of extracts from Cistus ladanifer and Lavandula pedunculata growing in S\u00e3o Domingos mining \narea \n\n \n128 \n\n \n\ndigestive and calming) plant, especially in the form of infusions, is reported (Cavanagh and Wilkinson, \n\n2002; Figueiredo et al., 2014). Oils of these species are also indicated as a potential natural \n\nbiopesticide (Gonz\u00e1lez-Coloma et al., 2011). In particular, Lavandula pedunculata (Mill.) Cav. Present \n\nantifungal and antioxidant activity being, additionally, a potential source of active metabolites with a \n\npositive effect on human health (Costa et al., 2013; Matos et al., 2009; Zuzarte et al., 2009). \n\nSeveral studies have been developed on some mining areas from the Iberian Pyrite Belt aiming to \n\nevaluate the elements accumulation in tolerant plants and their implications for phytostabilisation \n\n(Abreu et al., 2008; Anawar et al., 2011; de la Fuente et al., 2010; Freitas et al., 2004; Santos et al., \n\n2012). Nevertheless, little information is available concerning the quality of plants as source of \n\nimportant phytochemicals and/or the public safety risk of these products derived from plants growing \n\nin contaminated areas (Zheljazkov et al., 2006, 2008). \n\nIn order to characterize and valorise some autochthones species, which are used in rehabilitation \n\nprocesses of mining areas, as new sources of bioactive substances, the aims of this study were to: i) \n\ncharacterize the phytochemical profile of the different extracts (aqueous and hexane extraction) from \n\nshoots of Lavandula pedunculata and Cistus ladanifer growing in soils from S\u00e3o Domingos mining \n\narea and a control area in the same climatic conditions; ii) quantify some of the major components of \n\nthese extracts; and iii) evaluate the influence of potentially hazardous elements accumulated in the \n\naerial part of the plants on the quality of the plant-based products (infusions and extracts). \n\n \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n\nSite characterization \n\n \n\nTwo areas, under Mediterranean conditions (Alentejo region, SE of Portugal), were selected to this \n\nstudy: a mining area with multielementar contamination ? S\u00e3o Domingos (SD), and a reference area \n\nwith non-contaminated soils ? Corte do Pinto (CP). In both areas, Lavandula pedunculata (Mill.) Cav. \n\n(sin. Lavandula pedunculata subsp. Sampaioana (Rozeira) Franco, Lavandula stoechas subsp. \n\nlusitanica (Chaytor) Rozeira, Lavandula stoechas subsp. pedunculata (Mill.) Rozeira and Lavandula \n\nsampaioana (Rozeira) Rivas Mart., T.E. D\u00edaz &amp; Fern. Gonz.) and Cistus ladanifer L. are representative \n\nspecies of the vegetation community in both areas. According to Thornthwaite classification, the \n\nclimate in these areas is semiarid, mesothermic. \n\nS\u00e3o Domingos is an old copper mine located in the Iberian Pyrite Belt, which is abandoned since \n\n1960. The mining activities occurred since pre-roman period and in the modern times from the middle \n\nof the XIX century till the 60\u2019s of the XX century (Quental et al., 2002). As a result of the different \n\nperiods and techniques of exploitation, large amounts of wastes from ore processing or extracting \n\nwere produced and spread, irregularly, along the mine area (\u00c1lvarez-Valero et al., 2008; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez \n\net al., 2008, Quental et al., 2003). On some of these materials were developed Incipient soils (Spolic \n\nTechnosol Toxic ? IUSS Working Group WRB, 2007), which present high total concentrations of \n\nseveral potentially hazardous elements (Abreu et al., 2008, 2012a,b; Freitas et al., 2004; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez \n\net al., 2014; Santos et al., 2012, 2014, Tavares et al., 2008). In the mining area, there are also some \n\nsoils developed on schists and greywackes (Leptosols Lithic; IUSS Working Group WRB, 2007), \n\n\n\nComposition and aromatic profile of extracts from Cistus ladanifer and Lavandula pedunculata growing in S\u00e3o Domingos mining \narea \n\n129 \n\n \n\nwhich are influenced by adjacent tailings and/or acid mine drainage. Corte do Pinto area is located \n\nabout 4 km to the north of S\u00e3o Domingos mine whose soils are also classified as Leptosols Lithic \n\n(IUSS Working Group WRB, 2007) but without any contamination. \n\n \n\nSoils and plants analysis \n\n \n\nSeveral sampling areas were selected in the two study areas in order to include representative \n\nsoils where L. pedunculata (three in SD mining area and three in CP) or C. ladanifer (three in SD \n\nmining area and three in CP) were growing. In each sampling area (?10 m\n2\n each), composite samples \n\nof shoots of L. pedunculata and C. ladanifer were collected during the flowering period (April 2012) as \n\nwell as soils surrounding the rhizosphere system of all harvested plants (?3 kg of homogenate; &lt;20 \n\ncm of depth). Soil samples were air-dried, homogenised, and sieved. Classical characterization of \n\nsoils (fraction &lt;2 mm) was carried out (P\u00f3voas and Barral, 1992): pH and electrical conductivity in \n\nwater suspension (1:2.5 m/V); organic carbon (Tinsley method); extractable P and K (Egner-Riehm \n\nmethod) and total nitrogen (Kjeldahl method). The total concentrations of Al, As, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb, Sb \n\nand Zn in soils (fraction &lt;2 mm) were determined by ICP and INAA, after acid digestion (perchloric \n\nacid + nitric acid + hydrochloric acid + hydrofluoric acid; Actlabs ISO/IEC 17025; Activation \n\nLaboratories, 2015a).  \n\nPlant samples were washed, dried (40 \u00b0C), homogenised and stored in the dark at room \n\ntemperature until analysis. For multielementar determination, shoots were finely ground and analysed \n\nby ICP-MS after ashing (475 \u00b0C) and nitric acid digestion (Activation Laboratories, 2015b). \n\nFor obtaining the extracts, the dried plant material (SD1?SD5 and CP1) was ground in a wood \n\nchipper/leaf shredder. The extracts were obtained with an accelerated solvent extractor (ASE, \n\nDionex). For this, 3 g of L. pedunculata shoots or 4 g of C. ladanifer shoots were placed in 11 mL-\n\nstainless steel cells. Plant samples were treated with hexane (single extraction of both plant species) \n\nor with water and then with hexane (sequential extraction of L. pedunculata), at 100 \u00baC, 2000 psi, for \n\n30 min, and one extraction cycle. Compounds from water extracts were ultrasonically extracted with \n\nhexane (1:1 V/V) for one hour. Extracts were stored in a glass flask at ?18 \u00baC until their analysis. The \n\nsolvents (water and hexane) were selected due to the sustainability of the process and extraction \n\nefficiency. Sequential extraction was done in order to evaluate the recover efficiency of the valuable \n\ncompounds with both extractant solutions.  \n\nExtracts were analysed by gas chromatography (Model 450 GC, Agilent Technologies) coupled to \n\nmass spectrometry (Model 220 MS, Agilent Technologies). Before analysis, a mix of deuterated \n\ninternal standards, containing 1,4-dichlorobenzene-d4, acenaphthene-d10, chrysene-d12, \n\nnaphthalene-d8, perylene-d12 and phenanthrene-d10 (Internal Standards Mix 33, Dr. Ehrenstorfer), \n\nwere added to the extracts at 0.5 mg/L as a constant concentration. Chromatographic separations \n\nwere performed by a FactorFour VF-5ms EZ-Guard capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 \u00b5m; \n\nAgilent Technologies) operated with the following oven temperature program: 40 \u00baC (held for 10 min) \n\nto 180 \u00baC (held for 10 min), at 3 \u00baC/min. Helium was used as carrier gas, at a constant flow of 1 \n\nmL/min. The injector was operated at 250 \u00baC in split/splitless mode. The mass spectrometer operated \n\n\n\nComposition and aromatic profile of extracts from Cistus ladanifer and Lavandula pedunculata growing in S\u00e3o Domingos mining \narea \n\n \n130 \n\n \n\nin full scan mode. Ionization of the molecules was carried out by electron impact and the ion trap \n\ntemperature was fixed at 220 \u00baC. \n\nThe composition of the extracts was expressed in percentage values calculated by the \n\nnormalization method from the GC peak areas, without using correction factors, and as mean values \n\nof two injections from each extract. The component identification was made by comparison of mass \n\nspectra using NIST98 spectral library, their retention indices, pure reference compounds and literature \n\ndata. The linear retention indices were determined relative to the retention times obtained for a \n\nstandard mixture containing a series of n-alkanes C9?C18.  \n\nFor the quantitative analysis of the major components in the extracts, a calibration curve was \n\nobtained by injection of a standard containing a mixture of fenchone, verbenone, camphene, camphor \n\nand ?-pinene. The calibration standards were prepared in hexane, at several concentrations: 0.1, 1, 5, \n\n10, 25, 50, 75, 100 and 150 mg/L. Internal standards were also added in the same concentration as \n\nfor the plant samples (0.5 mg/L). The results were expressed in mg of each compound per kg of dried \n\nshoots. \n\nPlant infusions were prepared with 5 g of L. pedunculata shoots (SD1?SD3 and CP1?CP3; particle \n\nsize &lt;4 mm) and 100 ml of boiling water during 5 min of contact. Same elements than in soils were \n\ndetermined by Flame-AAS (Al, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn) and GF-AAS (As and Sb). \n\n \n\nData analysis \n\n \n\nData were analysed with the statistical programme SPSS v18.0 for Windows namely: concentration \n\nof the major compounds in the plant extracts by one way ANOVA and the Duncan test (p &lt;0.05) and \n\nconcentrations of the potentially hazardous elements in L. pedunculata infusions by non-parametrically \n\nusing Kruskal\u2013Wallis ANOVA by Ranks test. Bivariate Pearson correlations were used to correlate \n\nconcentrations of the elements in the plant shoots and the major compounds quantified (r > 0.95). \n\nQuality control of the analyses was made by analytical replicate samples, use of certified standards \n\nand blanks. \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nCharacteristics of the soils and plants \n\n \n\nSoils from S\u00e3o Domingos were developed on several mine wastes without or with different \n\nproportions of host rocks. This fact contributed to a great heterogeneity in their chemical \n\ncharacteristics (Table 1 and Fig. 1). The pH and concentrations of organic C and NPK the soils from \n\nthe mine area were lower than those of Corte do Pinto (Table 1). Although some soils from S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos are developed on schist and sediments, their intense influence by acid mine drainage \n\ncontribute to acid pH values. Moreover, the mixture of considerable proportion of host rocks with \n\ngossan led to the neutral pH of soil sample SD1. Low electrical conductivities and poor fertility were \n\nobtained in soils from both areas (Table 1).  \n\n\n\nComposition and aromatic profile of extracts from Cistus ladanifer and Lavandula pedunculata growing in S\u00e3o Domingos mining \narea \n\n131 \n\n \n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5\n\nS\nh\n\no\no\n\nts\n (\n\nm\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n)\n\nSoil (g/kg)\n\nMn\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10\n\nSoil (g/kg)\n\nPb\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n\nS\nh\n\no\no\n\nts\n (\n\nm\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n)\n\nSoil (g/kg)\n\nAlSD Lp CP Lp SD Cl CP Cl\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n0 1 2 3 4\n\nSoil (g/kg)\n\nAs\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n0 50 100 150 200\n\nS\nh\n\no\no\n\nts\n (\n\nm\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n)\n\nSoil (mg/kg)\n\nCr\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n0 500 1000 1500\n\nSoil (mg/kg)\n\nCu\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n0 100 200 300 400 500\n\nSoil (mg/kg)\n\nZn\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n0 200 400 600\n\nS\nh\n\no\no\n\nts\n (\n\nm\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n)\n\nSoil (mg/kg)\n\nSb\n\n \n\nFig. 1 Concentrations of potentially hazardous elements in soil (total fraction) and shoots of Lavandula \n\npedunculata (Lp) and Cistus ladanifer (Cl) collected in the S\u00e3o Domingos (SD) and Corte do Pinto (CP). \n\n\n\nComposition and aromatic profile of extracts from Cistus ladanifer and Lavandula pedunculata growing in S\u00e3o Domingos mining area \n\n132 \n\n \n\nTable 1 Chemical characteristics of the soils from S\u00e3o Domingos mine (SD) and Corte do Pinto (CP) areas and respective plant species collected. \n\n SD1 SD2 SD3 SD4 SD5 CP1 CP2 CP3 \n\nPlant \n\nspecies \nL. pedunculata L. pedunculata \n\nL. pedunculata \n\nC. ladanifer \nC. ladanifer C. ladanifer \n\nL. pedunculata \n\nC. ladanifer \n\nL. pedunculata \n\nC. ladanifer \n\nL. pedunculata \n\nC. ladanifer \n\npH (H2O) 6.7 4.4 3.5 4.3 4.3 6.6 7.1 7.1 \n\nEC (\u00b5S/cm) 383 \u2014 274 \u2014 603 104 246 423 \n\nNTotal (g/kg) 0.7 1.0 X 10\n-2\n\n 1.5 39.9 1.1 1.3 1.5 1.8 \n\nCOrg (g/kg) 9.4 125.2 21.0 12.0 14.5 14.3 16.3 22.5 \n\nPExt (mg/kg) 8.7 0.2&lt;0.9 1.3&lt;0.9 6.4 13.9 17.1 \n\nKExt (mg/kg) 100.5 65.6 56.5 83.3 143.2 98.0 165.2 128.7 \n\nEC: electrical conductivity in water 1:2.5 (m:V); Corg: Organic C; PExt: Extractable P; KExt: Extractable K \n\n\n\nComposition and aromatic profile of extracts from Cistus ladanifer and Lavandula pedunculata growing in S\u00e3o Domingos mining \narea \n\n133 \n\n \n\nThe total concentrations of As, Cu, Pb, Sb and Zn were higher in soils from S\u00e3o Domingos than \n\nfrom Corte do Pinto (Fig. 1), while the opposite was obtained for Al, Cr and Mn. Despite of the \n\nvariability, the total concentrations of the potentially hazardous elements in the soils from S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos are in the same range than those reported for mine wastes and/or soils developed on mine \n\nwastes from the same mine area (Abreu et al., 2012a,b; \u00c1lvarez-Valero et al., 2008; Anawar et al., \n\n2011, 2013; Dur\u00e3es et al., 2015; Freitas et al., 2004, 2009; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2008; Santos et al., \n\n2012, 2014; Tavares et al., 2008). \n\nSoils from S\u00e3o Domingos can be considered contaminated with As, Cu, Pb and Sb for agriculture \n\nand residential/parkland uses (maximum allowed values (MAV): 12 mg As/kg, 63 mg Cu/kg, 70?140 \n\nmg Pb/kg and 20 mg Sb/kg, depending on land use; CCME, 2007) while only one sample exceeded \n\nthe MAV for Zn (200 mg/kg; CCME, 2007).Total concentrations of As in soils from Corte do Pinto were \n\nabove the MAV, however those are not considered as contaminated. In fact, these amounts are \n\nassociated with the natural composition of the parent materials (schists and greywackes) from which \n\nsoils were developed (Abreu et al., 2008; Tavares et al., 2008). \n\nInterpopulation variation was observed for the concentrations of the potentially hazardous elements \n\nin the shoots of C. ladanifer and L. pedunculata (Fig. 1), as well as in the populations of both species \n\nfrom S\u00e3o Domingos (intrapopulation variability). This heterogeneity was already reported to C. \n\nladanifer (Santos et al., 2012, 2014 and references therein). Concentrations of the studied elements \n\n(excepted Cr and Mn in L. pedunculata and Cr in C. ladanifer) in the shoots of both species collected \n\nin S\u00e3o Domingos mine were higher than in those from non-contaminated area. In general, the same \n\nplant parts of the two species collected in S\u00e3o Domingos or other mining areas under arid and \n\nsemiarid conditions presented a wide range of concentrations for some of the studied elements \n\n(Santos et al., 2014 and references therein; de la Fuente et al., 2010) being, in some cases, similar \n\ncompared to those obtained in the present study. Nevertheless, these differences can be explained by \n\nseasonal and temporal variations in plants and the analysed plant part. \n\n \n\nInfusions and extracts of Lavandula pedunculata: Component identification and quantification \n\n \n\nIndependently of the contamination soil level and the concentrations of the potentially hazardous \n\nelements in shoots, the concentrations of Al, As, Cr, Pb and Sb in the infusions were below the \n\ndetection limit of the equipment measurement (mg/L ? &lt;0.5, 5.0 x 10\n-4\n\n, 0.05, 0.25 and 0.03, \n\nrespectively). No significant differences were obtained between the concentrations of Cu (mg/L ? SD: \n\n0.06?0.13, CP: 0.07?0.10 depending on sample) and Mn (mg/L \u2013SD: 0.52?4.54, CP: 2.17?3.14 \n\ndepending on sample) in infusions done with plants from the two studied areas. Nonetheless, Zn \n\nconcentrations were higher in the infusions done with S\u00e3o Domingos plants (0.57?1.45 mg/L) than in \n\nthose made with plants collected in the non-contaminated area (0.21?0.25 mg/L).The concentrations \n\nof the studied elements were in the same range than those reported by G\u00f6r\u00fcr et al. (2011) for black \n\nand green teas, as well as for several herbal infusions (Alt?nt?g et al., 2014) consumed in Turkey. In \n\nthis way, the consumption of infusions done with L. pedunculata from studied areas did not have \n\nhealth risk. \n\n\n\nComposition and aromatic profile of extracts from Cistus ladanifer and Lavandula pedunculata growing in S\u00e3o Domingos mining \narea \n\n \n134 \n\n \n\nIn the L. pedunculata extracts, obtained in the single extraction with hexane, were identified 34 \n\ncompounds accounting between 79 and 89 % of the total identified compounds (Table 2). Camphor \n\nwas the major component in all extracts (Table 2). Fenchone, eucalyptol, verbenone, bornyl acetate, \n\nborneol and linalool oxide cis also showed considerable amounts in all extracts. These compounds \n\npresent economic interest. In fact, camphor has been used as an antibacterial and antifungal \n\nsubstance and improving sleep quality being also a natural flavouring agent and an ingredient for food \n\nprocessing (Chu and Kemper, 2001). According to the same authors, fenchone also shows a \n\nsignificant antifungal activity and Cavanagh and Wilkinson (2002) indicated that camphor plants are \n\nused as insect repellents. Although considerable amounts of eucaliptol had been identified in \n\nLavandula samples, at economic level cannot be significant its extraction because the essential oil \n\nobtained from Eucaliptus globulus Labill. biomass residues (S of Portugal) had around 46 % of \n\neucalyptol (Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2013), being more profitable. Elaissi et al. (2012) also reported significant \n\namounts of eucalyptol (between 4.5 and 70 %) in oils extracted from different eucalyptus species from \n\nTunisia. Verbenone, bornyl acetate, borneol and linalool-family are compounds suggested for \n\nperfumery and household fragrances. Verbenone, bornyl acetate and borneol also present medicinal \n\n(e.g. antimicrobial and antispasmodic) and insect repellent properties (Phytochemical and \n\nethnobotanical databases, 2015). \n\nAlthough with amounts lesser than 1 % (Table 2), other valuable compounds were identified with \n\ngreat interest for medicine (e.g. eugenol: antibacterial, spasmolytic and anesthetic effect; coumarim \n\nand caryophyllene oxyde: anti-inflammatory; ?- and ?-pinene: antifungal) as well as for fragrance of \n\ncosmetics or household cleaners (e.g. linalyl acetate). Therefore, they should be highlighted. \n\nSome variation was obtained in the qualitative composition of the L. pedunculata extracts obtained \n\nby single extraction but, in general, it was not clear the differentiation between populations (Table 2) \n\nand, consequently, soil contamination level and concentrations of the potentially hazardous elements \n\nin shoots (Fig. 1). Concerning the concentrations of the some major components (Table 3), some \n\nsignificant differences were obtained among plant samples (except for verbenone) but no correlation \n\nwas obtained with the potentially hazardous elements in shoots. Thus, sample SD2 had the highest \n\nconcentration of fenchone while sample from non-contaminated area (CP1) presented the highest \n\nconcentration of camphor. Samples from SD3 and CP1 presented much more camphene. The use of \n\ncomposite samples of shoots affects the composition and, especially, the concentration of the \n\ncompounds in the extracts (Masetto et al., 2015; Raut and Karuppayil, 2014) justifying these \n\nvariations. \n\nIn the aqueous extract (first step of the sequential extraction) were identified 27 compounds, \n\nindependently of the plant samples, while in the following step (with hexane) were identified 26 \n\ncompounds (Table 4). The total fraction of the identified compounds varied between 52 and 85 % \n\ndepending on the sample and extraction step/solvent. \n\nAs for single extraction, major component in both extracts was camphor (Table 4). Fenchone and \n\nverbenone also had considerable amounts, especially in the aqueous extract, as well as borneol. It \n\nshould be noted that, in general, ?- and ?-pinene, bornyl acetate viridiflorol, hinesol and \n\nlongiverbenone also had considerable amounts but only in the hexane extract.

growing in S\u00e3o Domingos mining \narea \n\n139 \n\n \n\nZuzarte et al. (2009) to the essential oils of L. pedunculata, the aqueous extract from all the studied \n\nsamples (SD and CP) can have a significant antifungal activity due to a synergistic effect among the \n\ndifferent compounds with this proprietary (e.g. fenchone and camphor). Despite of the homogeneity of \n\nthe compounds in the main fraction in the Lavandula extracts, some components depended on the \n\nsample. Other compounds were also detected but only in some samples (e.g. Aqueous extract ? \n\ncaryophyllene oxide and viridiflorol in plant samples from the mine area; Hexane extract ? exo-\n\nFenchol and 6-Camphenol in samples SD1 and SD2).  \n\nDue to the difficult systematic position of L. pedunculata, the comparison of the data can be quite \n\ncomplex but most of the components identified in this study were also reported by several authors for \n\nthe same species (Costa et al., 2013; Figueiredo et al., 2014; Matos et al., 2015; Zuzarte et al., 2009) \n\nand for others Lavandula species (Lavandula angustifolia Mill., Danh et al., 2012; Lavadula luisieri \n\n(Rozeira) Rivas Mart., Gonz\u00e1lez-Coloma et al., 2011) independently of the extraction method. In \n\ngeneral, oils derived from L. stoechas (which can be included as subsp. synonymous of L. \n\npedunculata) have high camphor levels what is in agreement with the data obtained in this study. For \n\ninstance, the composition of the oils obtained from L. stoechas subsp. lusitanica and L. pedunculata \n\nsubsp. lusitanica (sin. L. pedunculata) from S of Portugal was also dominated by fenchone and \n\ncamphor but their amounts were much higher than the obtained in the present study (38.9 and 40.6 %, \n\n41.9 and 34.6 %; respectively; Costa et al., 2013; Matos et al., 2015). The oils from the same species \n\ncultivated near Lisbon were also characterized by high fenchone content (21?59 %). However, all \n\nsamples from S\u00e3o Domingos mine and Corte do Pinto had more borneol, cis-linalool oxide and \n\nespecially, verbenone than samples analysed by Matos et al. (2015) (&lt;0.5 %). In the oils obtained \n\nfrom L. pedunculata collected in the  North and Central Portugal, the amounts of the main compounds \n\nand even the major components were different from those determined in the plant samples from SD \n\nand CP (fenchone and 1,8-cineole or 1,8-cineole+camphor, depending on population; Zuzarte et al., \n\n2009). Thus, amounts of each component vary widely with the population, even in non-contaminated \n\nconditions. Differences in the composition of L. luisieri oils extracted from plant material in different \n\nmoist conditions (dry or fresh) and plant part (flowers and leaves) are reported, even if the same \n\nextraction method was used (Gomes et al., 2005; Gonz\u00e1lez-Coloma et al., 2011). \n\nSignificant differences were obtained among the concentrations of major compounds in L. \n\npedunculata extracted in the two steps (except verbenone in 2\nnd\n\n step of the extraction; Table 3). \n\nHowever, as for single extraction, no clear tendency was obtained according to the soil contamination. \n\nType and amount of the compounds also varied with extraction solution being some compounds \n\nonly identified in specific extract (e.g. Aqueous extract: coumarin, eucarvone and pinocarvone; \n\nHexane extracts: ?-pinene, aromadendrene, hinesol and tau-cadinol). In fact, solvents of different \n\npolarities extract different groups of compounds (Cowan, 1999). Besides, the extraction of some \n\ncompounds, namely phenolic, in L. pedunculata subsp. lusitanica is influenced by the nature and \n\npolarity of the solvent system (Costa et al., 2013). Independently of the plant samples (except SD2 for \n\ncamphene), the highest concentrations of the major compounds were obtained in the aqueous \n\nextracts, compared to the second step of the extraction with hexane (Table 3). The loss of volatile \n\n\n\nComposition and aromatic profile of extracts from Cistus ladanifer and Lavandula pedunculata growing in S\u00e3o Domingos mining \narea \n\n \n140 \n\n \n\ncompounds during the plant material drying after the first step of extraction can justify the decreasing \n\nof their concentrations. \n\nComparing the two methodologies of extraction (sequential and single with hexane), the application \n\nof the sequential extraction did not seem to have significant advantage in the recovery of more \n\nvaluable compounds from L. pedunculata. In fact, the concentrations of the major compounds in the \n\nextracts obtained in the single extraction were significantly higher or similar to the sum of both \n\nfractions. \n\nTaking into account the application of a single extraction, the use of water as the extracting solvent \n\ncan be considered a sustainable choice compared to other alternative solvents (hexane). In fact, only \n\nthe concentrations of camphene (highly volatile compounds) in hexane extract were significantly \n\nhigher than those in aqueous extracts, independently of the sample. For the other quantified \n\ncompounds, no clear differentiation was observed. In this way, aqueous extracts of L. pedunculata \n\ncould be directly used as for toilet water. \n\n \n\nExtracts of Cistus ladanifer: Component identification and quantification \n\n \n\nIn the extracts of C. ladanifer were identified 32 compounds, which represent between 29 and 43 % \n\nof the total compounds (Table 5). The composition of C. ladanifer extracts (obtained with hexane) was \n\ncomplex presenting a great number of compounds of difficult identification due to their very small \n\namounts (&lt;0.1 %), as reported for oils of the same species (Mariotti et al., 1997; Gomes et al., 2005). \n\nMoreover, in these extracts (and especially as in aqueous extracts obtained from the same species, \n\ndata not show) were found great number of undefined peaks. \n\nIndependently of the population and sample, the major component in the extracts was viridiflorol \n\n(Table 5). This compound was identified in the oils of different samples of C. ladanifer collected in \n\nPortugal and Morocco (14?17% and 19.4 %, respectively) being responsible for floral notes as \n\nindicated by Gomes et al. (2005) and Greche et al. (2009). On the contrary, major components in oils \n\nof other plant samples from Morocco were camphene and borneol (15.5 and 11.1 %, respectively; \n\nZidane et al., 2013), while in oils from the same species collected in Spain were trans-pinocarveol and \n\nviridiflorol (20 and 13.6 %, respectively; Verdeguer et al., 2011). Plants from Spain cultivated in the \n\nEast coast of Corsica showed, especially, ?-pinene in their oils (16?47 %) but, in some samples, was \n\nalso found, as major component, viridiflorol (20?23 %; Mariotti et al., 1997). \n\nAdditionally, other compounds occurred, in small amounts (&lt;2.5 %; Table 5), in the plant extracts \n\nfrom S\u00e3o Domingos and Corte do Pinto. These compounds have a great odoriferous interest (e.g. \n\namber-like scent: ambrox and caryophyllene oxide; fresh-camphoraceous: bornyl acetate, borneol and \n\nmyrtenol) (Gomes et al., 2005) and microbial effect (e.g. ?-pinene, ?-pinene, fenchone and camphor) \n\n(Chu and Kemper, 2001).  \n\nCistus ladanifer extracts from the two studied populations exhibited similar profiles and quite \n\nvariation in the qualitative composition (Table 5). These results are in agreement with those reported \n\nfor other extracts (obtained with different solvents and methodologies) and populations (Gomes et al., \n\n2005; Greche et al., 2009; Mariotti et al., 1997; Regino et al., 1987; Teixeira et al., 2007; Verdeguer et \n\n\n\nComposition and aromatic profile of extracts from Cistus ladanifer and Lavandula pedunculata growing in S\u00e3o Domingos mining \narea \n\n141 \n\n \n\nal., 2011; Zidane et al., 2013 and references therein). Therefore, contamination in soils and potentially \n\nhazardous elements in C. ladanifer shoots (Fig. 1) did not affect the quality of the extracts.  \n\nTable 5 Chemical composition (%) of extracts, obtained with hexane, from Cistus ladanifer shoots collected in \n\nS\u00e3o Domingos mine (SD) and Corte do Pinto (CP; non-contaminated area) (mean \u00b1 ?; n = 3). \n\nLRI Compound identified SD3 SD4 SD5 CP1 \n\n902 ?-Thujene 0.10 \u00b1 0.02 0.23 \u00b1 0.07 0.09 \u00b1 0.03 0.22 \u00b1 0.01 \n\n916 ?-Pinene 1.31 \u00b1 0.26 2.02 \u00b1 0.48 2.35 \u00b1 0.80 2.16 \u00b1 0.52 \n\n935 Camphene 0.41 \u00b1 0.11 1.00 \u00b1 0.25 0.32 \u00b1 0.08 0.92 \u00b1 0.05 \n\n940 ?-Pinene 0.25 \u00b1 0.05 0.26 \u00b1 0.06 0.35 \u00b1 0.09 0.46 \u00b1 0.10 \n\n1020 1,3,8-p-Menthatriene 0.20 \u00b1 0.03 0.22 \u00b1 0.02 0.28 \u00b1 0.09 0.32 \u00b1 0.01 \n\n1030 2,2,6-Trimethylcyclohexanone 1.46 \u00b1 0.43 0.75 \u00b1 0.06 1.26 \u00b1 0.56 2.26 \u00b1 0.18 \n\n1068 Linalool oxide cis 0.20 \u00b1 0.03 0.20 \u00b1 0.01 0.21 \u00b1 0.07 0.29 \u00b1 0.03 \n\n1082 Fenchone 0.26 \u00b1 0.05 0.05 \u00b1 0.01 0.05 \u00b1 0.01 0.06 \u00b1 0.01 \n\n1103 2,4-Dimethylcyclohexanol 1.04 \u00b1 0.18 0.70 \u00b1 0.10 0.96 \u00b1 0.31 1.49 \u00b1 0.15 \n\n1121 6-Camphenol 0.15 \u00b1 0.01 0.18 \u00b1 0.03 0.19 \u00b1 0.06 0.22 \u00b1 0.00 \n\n1134 Isopinocarveol 0.33 \u00b1 0.05 0.44 \u00b1 0.06 0.38 \u00b1 0.11 0.47 \u00b1 0.07 \n\n1139 Camphor 0.81 \u00b1 0.14 0.37 \u00b1 0.04 0.34 \u00b1 0.13 0.41 \u00b1 0.05 \n\n1142 cis-Verbenol 0.42 \u00b1 0.10 0.63 \u00b1 0.06 0.79 \u00b1 0.27 0.72 \u00b1 0.15 \n\n1156 Pinocarvone 0.11 \u00b1 0.02 0.11 \u00b1 0.03 0.12 \u00b1 0.03 0.12 \u00b1 0.00 \n\n1166 Borneol 0.85 \u00b1 0.16 1.18 \u00b1 0.13 0.84 \u00b1 0.28 1.46 \u00b1 0.16 \n\n1176 ?-Terpineol 0.20 \u00b1 0.06 0.19 \u00b1 0.03 0.28 \u00b1 0.10 0.37 \u00b1 0.06 \n\n1182 p-Cymen-8-ol 0.40 \u00b1 0.06 0.44 \u00b1 0.03 0.51 \u00b1 0.21 0.74 \u00b1 0.01 \n\n1190 Myrtenol 0.27 \u00b1 0.07 0.50 \u00b1 0.10 0.40 \u00b1 0.16 0.43 \u00b1 0.00 \n\n1200 Verbenone 2.21 \u00b1 0.28 2.34 \u00b1 0.28 2.75 \u00b1 0.83 3.56 \u00b1 0.25 \n\n1217 trans-Carveol 0.58 \u00b1 0.54 0.37 \u00b1 0.07 0.45 \u00b1 0.09 0.51 \u00b1 0.09 \n\n1280 Bornyl acetate 1.07 \u00b1 0.22 1.37 \u00b1 0.17 0.97 \u00b1 0.32 1.54 \u00b1 0.13 \n\n1298 Thymol 0.52 \u00b1 0.12 0.45 \u00b1 0.02 0.73 \u00b1 0.35 1.12 \u00b1 0.24 \n\n1347 Benzenepropanoic acid 0.65 \u00b1 0.40 0.74 \u00b1 0.33 0.59 \u00b1 0.59 2.45 \u00b1 1.96 \n\n1547 Frambinone 0.61 \u00b1 0.13 0.74 \u00b1 0.06 1.35 \u00b1 0.61 0.69 \u00b1 0.10 \n\n1561 Rhododendrol 0.76 \u00b1 0.26 1.17 \u00b1 0.27 2.51 \u00b1 0.87 1.15 \u00b1 0.08 \n\n1572 Spathulenol 0.30 \u00b1 0.07 0.46 \u00b1 0.02 0.41 \u00b1 0.09 0.24 \u00b1 0.03 \n\n1587 Viridiflorol 8.86 \u00b1 1.76 9.09 \u00b1 1.12 12.23 \u00b1 5.50 12.81 \u00b1 2.01 \n\n1596 Globulol 2.04 \u00b1 0.42 2.26 \u00b1 0.35 2.88 \u00b1 1.25 2.54 \u00b1 0.29 \n\n1601 Caryophyllene oxide 0.93 \u00b1 0.21 1.24 \u00b1 0.13 1.03 \u00b1 0.57 1.59 \u00b1 0.45 \n\n1602 Cubenol 0.66 \u00b1 0.39 0.98 \u00b1 0.03 0.87 \u00b1 0.41 1.23 \u00b1 0.46 \n\n1748 n-Heptadecene 0.36 \u00b1 0.09 0.11 \u00b1 0.02 0.38 \u00b1 0.12 0.39 \u00b1 0.10 \n\n1753 Ambrox 0.15 \u00b1 0.07 0.12 \u00b1 0.05 0.15 \u00b1 0.05 0.12 \u00b1 0.03 \n\nTotal identified compounds 29.89 \u00b1 6.49 37.73 \u00b1 14.99 31.50 \u00b1 3.51 44.82 \u00b1 6.25 \n\nLRI: Linear retention indices determined with homologous series of n-alkanes \n\n\n\nComposition and aromatic profile of extracts from Cistus ladanifer and Lavandula pedunculata growing in S\u00e3o Domingos mining \narea \n\n \n142 \n\n \n\nA wide variation in the composition of this species extracts can be explained by the analysed plant \n\npart and its conditions of collection, drying and storage as well as method of extraction (Raut and \n\nKaruppayil, 2014). In fact, Gomes et al. (2005) found that the use of dry material, instead of fresh \n\nmaterial, can affect the amounts of the components with middle to high volatility in C. ladanifer oils, \n\nhowever the influence level seems to depend on the population (located N or S of Portugal). \n\nComposition and yield of C. ladanifer oil also vary along the year, storage time and with the different \n\ngeographical sources of the plants, as well as the solvent used in the extraction (Regino et al., 1987). \n\nThe influence of the solvent and/or the analysed part of the plant (flowers, fruit, stem or leaves) on the \n\nextracted content of flavonoids and phenolics from C. ladanifer shoots is reported (Andrade et al., \n\n2009; Zidane et al., 2013). Even using another methodology of extraction (simultaneous distillation\u2013\n\nextraction) with several solvents (pentane, cyclohexane, hexane and diethyl, ether and mixture of \n\npentane/diethyl ether), a distinct efficiency of extraction was observed according on compound. \n\nHowever, in general, the average extraction efficiencies were quite similar (Teixeira et al., 2007). \n\nConcerning the concentrations of some major components (Table 6), some significant differences \n\nwere obtained among samples. Sample SD3 had more camphor and fenchone while in SD4 was \n\ndetermined the highest camphene concentrations. For ?-pinene and verbenone, some samples from \n\nthe mining area showed similar concentrations compared to the samples from non-contaminated area \n\n(CP1). However, no correlation was obtained between concentrations of the major components and \n\nthe potentially hazardous elements in shoots. Thus, inter or intra-variability of the plants and their \n\nconditions of growth and/or ecological stress do not justified these variations. Possibly, the type of \n\nplant material used, i.e. composite samples of shoots, which may include different proportions of \n\nleaves, stems and flowers, can contribute to the variation of the compounds concentrations. \n\n \n\nTable 6 Concentration of some major components (mg/kg) in extracts, obtained with hexane, from Cistus \n\nladanifer shoots collected in S\u00e3o Domingos mine (SD) and Corte do Pinto (CP; non-contaminated area) (mean \u00b1 \n\n?; n = 3). \n\n mg/kg \n\nSamples ?-Pinene Camphene Camphor Fenchone Verbenone \n\nSD3 114.9 \u00b1 29.3\nab\n\n 29.9 \u00b1 7.0\nbc\n\n 70.2 \u00b1 4.1\u00aa 20.7 \u00b1 0.2\u00aa 232.0 \u00b1 6.9\u00aa \n\nSD4 124.5 \u00b1 12.4\nab\n\n 53.3 \u00b1 5.0\na\n 31.3 \u00b1 5.0\n\nb\n 4.5 \u00b1 0.9\n\nb\n 131.8 \u00b1 12.6\n\nb\n \n\nSD5 163.7 \u00b1 43.8\u00aa 20.8 \u00b1 5.5\nc\n 39.1 \u00b1 13.6\n\nb\n 5.4 \u00b1 1.3\n\nb\n 200.9 \u00b1 85.1\n\nab\n \n\nCP1 107.8 \u00b1 3.9\nb\n 39.6 \u00b1 8.3\n\nb\n 14.5 \u00b1 0.2\n\nc\n 4.2 \u00b1 1.9\n\nb\n 189.9 \u00b1 33.6\n\nab\n \n\nValues for each compound followed by a different letter are significantly different (p &lt;0.05) \n \n\nCONCLUSION \n\n \n\nSoils from S\u00e3o Domingos can be considered contaminated with As, Cu, Pb and Sb. The \n\nconcentrations of the potentially hazardous elements in the shoots of C. ladanifer and L. pedunculata \n\nfrom S\u00e3o Domingos presented intrapopulation variability in their concentrations of the potentially \n\nhazardous elements. In general, concentrations of the studied elements in shoots of both species \n\n\n\nComposition and aromatic profile of extracts from Cistus ladanifer and Lavandula pedunculata growing in S\u00e3o Domingos mining \narea \n\n143 \n\n \n\n(excepted Cr and Mn in L. pedunculata and Cr in C. ladanifer) collected in S\u00e3o Domingos mining area \n\nwere higher than in the same species from the non-contaminated area. \n\nThe infusions done with L. pedunculata shoots from S\u00e3o Domingos had only concentrations of Zn \n\nsignificantly different compared to the infusions of the plants from the non-contaminated area. \n\nIndependently of the population concentrations of the potentially hazardous elements in L. \n\npedunculata infusions were small so, this product can be considered for human consumption without \n\nany risk. Extracts obtained from C. ladanifer and L. pedunculata growing in S\u00e3o Domingos mining \n\narea had valuable compounds which might be used for a wide range of applications. Since the \n\nextracts are complex mixtures of different compounds, it is difficult to attribute their \n\nbiological/odoriferous activity to a single or a particular constituent. However, extracts of both species \n\npresented great potential pharmaceutical and fragrance/perfumery industry. \n\nQualitative composition of the extracts was almost constant over the range of concentrations of the \n\nelements in the soils (contaminated and non-contaminated). This study demonstrated that high \n\nconcentrations of potentially hazardous elements in soils did not affect the quality of the extracts. In \n\nthis way, phytostabilisation of mining areas using these species can provide economic return by the \n\nexploration of these products. However, it is essential to confirm the concentration of hazardous \n\nelements in the extracted plant residues. In order to improve the efficiency, the extraction should be \n\nadjusted by setting the operation conditions pressure and temperature. \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors would like to thank: Jos\u00e9 Correia for technical support; the \n\nPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) for the PhD grant (SFRH/BD/80198/2011). \n\nThis work was developed in the scope of the projects: LEAF (Linking Landscape, Environment, \n\nAgriculture and Food Research Centre) ?

POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF \n\nTECHNOSOLS COMPOSED OF GOSSAN AND \n\nSULFIDE-RICH WASTES FROM S\u00c3O DOMINGOS \n\nMINE: ASSAY OF SIMULATED LEACHING \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPotential environmental impact of Technosols composed of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes from S\u00e3o Domingos mine: assay of \nsimulated leaching \n\n149 \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\n \n\nThis study aimed to evaluate: the effectiveness of two Technosols prepared with gossan or sulfide-rich \n\nwastes and organic/inorganic amendment mixtures, by the analysis of the over time variation of the \n\nelemental concentrations  in their simulated leachates; and the potential environmental risk of these \n\nTechnosols evaluated from the mass of the leached potentially hazardous elements calculated taking \n\ninto account the leachates elemental concentrations and the tailings mass in S\u00e3o Domingos mine \n\narea.  \n\nComposite samples of two S\u00e3o Domingos mining wastes (gossan wastes ? GW; sulfide-rich wastes ? \n\nSW) were collected. Amendment mixtures, containing different organic/inorganic wastes (from green-\n\nagriculture, distillation of Ceratonia siliqua L. and Arbutus unedo L. fruits and limestone quarry), were \n\napplied at 12, 30 and 60 g/kg to GW and SW. Two sets of microcosm pot assays were performed \n\nunder controlled conditions in greenhouse, and monitored during seven and thirteen months for GW \n\nand SW, respectively. Materials from each pot/treatment (&lt;5 cm of depth) were collected after one, \n\nfour, seven and thirteen months of incubation, and used to obtain simulated leachates (DIN \n\nextraction). The leachates were analysed for pH, electrical conductivity, and the concentrations of \n\nanions and cations by F-AAS, GF-AAS, HPLC and UV-VIS. \n\nSimulated leachates from SW had lower pH and higher concentrations of potentially hazardous \n\nelements than leachates from GW. The concentrations of As in leachates from GW-Technosols were \n\nhigher than those in leachates from GW-control but &lt;0.6 mg/kg. In GW-Technosols leachates, the pH \n\nand the concentrations of some nutrients (e.g. Ca and phosphates) also increased when compared to \n\ncontrol. In the SW-Technosols, the pH of the leachates increased only in the first month as long as \n\nlimestone was present. In these leachates was observed a general trend of concentrations decrease \n\nfor some elements (e.g. As, sulfate, Fe, Pb), especially in the first month. A clear influence of the dose \n\nand type of amendments was not observed during the experimental time span for both wastes. \n\nThe concentrations of the elements like Al, Ca, Fe and Pb in the leachates are controlled by both the \n\npH of the solutions and the concentrations of phosphates and sulfates. The extensive mass of the \n\nstudied mine wastes contribute to the release to the neighbouring environment of considerable \n\namounts of potentially hazardous elements. The rehabilitation of the mine wastes by the conception of \n\nTechnosols, especially with sulfide-rich wastes, can reduce significantly the environmental impact. \n\n \n\nKEYWORDS DIN extraction \u2022 Environmental impact \u2022 Potentially hazardous elements \u2022 Leaching \n\nmethods \n\n \n\n\n\nPotential environmental impact of Technosols composed of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes from S\u00e3o Domingos mine: assay of \nsimulated leaching \n\n150 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBaseado no artigo submetido \u00e0 revista Journal of Soils and Sediments: Erika S.

The oxidation of the sulfides produces extreme acid mine drainage (AMD) containing high \n\nconcentrations of potentially hazardous elements (Abreu et al., 2010; S\u00e1nchez-Espa\u00f1a et al., 2005), \n\nwhich can be spread to the adjacent areas.  \n\nS\u00e3o Domingos mine (SE of Portugal) is one of the abandoned mines located in the Portuguese IPB \n\nthat present severe environmental impacts due to the high volume of spoils and tailings and the \n\ndimension of the areas affected by AMD (\u00c1lvarez-Valero et al., 2008; Matos and Martins, 2006). The \n\nexploitation and extraction processes in this mine (between pre-roman period and 1966) produced \n\nbetween 27 and 32 Tg of different mining wastes, which include around 17 % of sulfide-rich wastes \n\n(e.g. pyrite blocks, brittle pyrite, modern and Roman slags and smelting ashes) and 15 % of gossan \n\nwastes (\u00c1lvarez-Valero et al., 2008; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2008). The sulfides-rich tailings, mainly \n\ncomposed of crushed pyrite and smelting ashes, show a very low pH and a large capacity to generate, \n\ncontinuously, AMD (Santos et al., 2014a). However, both mine wastes have high total concentrations \n\nof several elements contributing to a multielemental contamination through their leachates (Abreu et \n\nal., 2008, 2010; \u00c1lvarez-Valero et al., 2008; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2008; Santos et al., 2014a, 2015).  \n\nThe ecological rehabilitation of the S\u00e3o Domingos mining area should be initiated by the \n\nimprovement of the chemical characteristics of mine wastes, especially sulfide-rich wastes, in order to \n\nminimize the leaching and/or elements concentrations in the leachates. These waste materials are \n\nbared and subject to more or less intense water erosion. The tailings, mainly composed of gossan \n\nmaterials, are naturally colonized by vegetation and present low reactivity and capacity to generate \n\nAMD. However, this vegetation is sparse and their growth is quite slow. In order to stimulate the in situ \n\nplant growth, a more effective plant cover and species diversity, as well as the substratum microbial \n\nactivity related to nutrients cycling, the physical and chemical characteristics (especially fertility) of the \n\nwastes should be improved. \n\nThe application of amendment mixtures to the mine wastes, which makes a Technosol, can be a \n\nvaluable technique because these amendments can decrease the potentially hazardous elements \n\nconcentrations in the leachates, can create/promote the different biological soil functions, improving \n\nthe wastes structure and water holding capacity and, consequently, contributing to the rehabilitation of \n\nthe area (Kumpiene et al., 2008; Mac\u00edas 2004; Mac\u00edas et al., 2011).  \n\nSome studies discuss the potential hazard of mine wastes (amended or not) based on the \n\nelemental concentrations in the available fraction (Adriano et al., 2004; Forsberg et al., 2008; Reis et \n\nal., 2012; Santos et al., 2014a) and/or ecotoxicological indicators (Alvarenga et al., 2009; Gonz\u00e1lez et \n\nal., 2012; Santos et al., 2013, 2015). To the best of our knowledge, there is no information concerning \n\nthe amount of potentially hazardous elements that can be released to the surrounding environment, by \n\nleaching, from the entire mine wastes mass present in the field, mass when a rehabilitation process is \n\n\n\nPotential environmental impact of Technosols composed of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes from S\u00e3o Domingos mine: assay of \nsimulated leaching \n\n152 \n\n \n\nto be implemented. In order to optimize a Technosol, it is crucial to measure the chemical elements \n\nconcentrations in the leachates.  \n\nSeveral leaching tests are used for scientific purposes, in an attempt to simulate the leaching \n\nprocesses at which the materials are exposed in the field during the rain events in order to evaluate \n\nthe leachates quality and the elements concentrations leached from the materials (Chezom et al., \n\n2013; F\u00e4llman and Aurell, 1996; Perera et al., 2005).  \n\nThe DIN method (DIN 38414-S4 extraction), one of the most commonly used, is a standard batch \n\ntest widely used for solid wastes and recommended by European Union (Kocasoy and Murat, 2009). It \n\nhas been regulatory compliance in Germany and Austria, and was used as basis for the European \n\nstandard leaching method EN 12457 and other tests recently developed under CEN TC/292 (Perera et \n\nal., 2005). In this method, is used a 1:10 (m:V) solid wastes:distilled (deionized) water ratio, \n\ncontinuously agitated for 24 h. The water percolation through the waste materials is also used as a \n\ndirect and simple percolation method of obtaining leachates (P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2008; Santos et al., \n\n2014a, 2015; Yao et al., 2008). \n\nThis study aimed to evaluate: i) the variations of the elemental concentrations in the simulated \n\nleachates from Technosols, prepared with gossan or sulfide-rich mine wastes and organic/inorganic \n\namendments after one, four, seven and thirteen months of incubation; and ii) the potential \n\nenvironmental risk of these Technosols evaluated from the mass of the leached potentially hazardous \n\nelements calculated taking into account the leachates elemental concentrations and the tailings mass \n\nin S\u00e3o Domingos mining area. \n\n \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n\nComponents of the Technosols \n\n \n\nComposite samples of two mining wastes (gossan wastes \u2013 GW and sulfide-rich wastes \u2013 SW) \n\nwere collected within S\u00e3o Domingos mine in 2009, close to the open pit (GW) and in the south-west \n\nzone of the open pit near the former copper leaching tanks (SW). These mine wastes were mainly \n\nchosen owing to their great volumetry and wide distribution in S\u00e3o Domingos mine, as well as their \n\nchemical characteristics (\u00c1lvarez-Valero et al., 2008; Quental et al., 2002, 2013).  \n\nThe Technosols were composed of gossan (GW) or sulfide-rich wastes (SW) and amendment \n\nmixtures containing distinct organic/inorganic wastes from green-agriculture (plant remains + \n\nstrawberry substrate at 2:3 m/m \u2013 AW; and rockwool used for strawberry crops \u2013 RW) and small \n\ndistilleries (Arbutus unedo L. and Ceratonia siliqua L. fruit spirits distillation \u2013 AuW and CW, \n\nrespectively) at 12 g/kg, 30 g/kg and 60 g/kg of each mine waste. In Technosols containing SW were \n\nalso applied residues from quarry (limestone rock wastes \u2013 LW), at 22 g/kg. Seven Technosols were \n\ntested for each mine waste (n = 3 or 4 for each Technosol made with GW or SW, respectively) (Table \n\n1). In order to assess the efficiency of the Technosols, control treatments were also considered \n\ncontaining only the mine wastes (n = 3 or 4 for GW or SW, respectively). \n\n\n\nPotential environmental impact of Technosols composed of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes from S\u00e3o Domingos mine: assay of \nsimulated leaching \n\n153 \n\n \n\nThe organic and inorganic amendments were used due to their large quantities in the mine vicinity, \n\nvery small cost (only associated to the transport) and beneficial and safe characteristics. The chemical \n\ncharacteristics of the used materials are given in Table 2.  \n\n \n\nExperimental set up and samples analysis \n\n \n\nThe mine wastes and amendments were air-dried. All materials were mixed manually, potted and \n\nmaintained at 70 % of their water-holding capacity. Two sets of microcosm assays were performed in \n\npots (?2 kg of each mine waste; Assay 1 \u2013 total fraction of SW and Assay 2 \u2013 fraction &lt;10 mm of GW) \n\nunder controlled conditions in greenhouse. The assays were monitored during seven and thirteen \n\nmonths for GW (n = 3 per treatment) and SW (n = 4 per treatment), respectively. \n\nSamples from control (GW or SW) and Technosols were collected (&lt;5 cm depth) after one, four, \n\nseven and thirteen months of incubation. These materials were homogenized, sieved (&lt;2 mm) and \n\nkept fresh (4 \u00baC) until chemical analysis. They were used to obtain simulated leachates (DIN 38414-S4 \n\nextraction). In the method DIN, the different chemical elements were extracted from the solid phases \n\nby contact with distilled water (1:10 m/V), for 24 h in a rotatory agitator. Following the DIN extraction, \n\npH and electrical conductivity (EC) were measured after 15 min and 24 h of agitation. Simulated \n\nleachates were filtrated (0.45 \u00b5m) and stored at \u201318 \u00baC until the analysis. In the leachates were \n\ndetermined the concentrations of: Al, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Pb and Zn by flame atomic absorption \n\nspectrometry; As by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry; chlorides, nitrates and sulfates \n\nby ion chromatography; and phosphates by visible spectrophotometry (molybdenum blue method; \n\nUSEPA 1979).  \n\n \n\nData analysis \n\n \n\nStatistical analysis was performed with the statistical programme SPSS v18.0 for Windows. Data \n\nwere analysed by one way ANOVA, and post-hoc Duncan\u2019s test (p &lt;0.05) was used to separate \n\nmeans. Data not satisfying assumptions for ANOVA were analysed non-parametrically using Kruskal-\n\nWallis ANOVA by a rank test. For statistical purposes, the results below the detection limit were \n\nassumed as half of the detection limit. \n\nThe potential environmental risk of SW, GW, and respective Technosols was evaluated from the \n\nmass of the leached potentially hazardous elements.

These \n\nresults were in the same range than acid mine drainages from S\u00e3o Domingos mine and other mines \n\nbelonging to the IPB (Abreu et al., 2010; Sanchez-Espa\u00f1a et al., 2005, 2008). Nevertheless, the pH \n\nvalues of leachates from the present study were lower than those in simulated leaching (1:20 m:V) \n\nusing mineralized rock samples from Furtei gold mine (2.6?5.0; Da Pelo et al., 2009). The pH values \n\nmeasured in the sulfide-rich wastes from S\u00e3o Domingos can be related to their content in sulfides. \n\nAfter one month of incubation, the pH of the leachates from SW-Technosols increased to values \n\nbetween 3.8 and 5.1 (Fig. 1B) due to the presence limestone rock wastes. However, after four months, \n\nthe pH of the leachates of these SW-Technosols decreased to the initial value, similar to the leachates \n\nfrom control (pH ?2.4), due to the continuous generation of acid drainage, which promoted the \n\ncarbonates dissolution. In fact, the variation of pH between 15 min and 24 h confirm that limestone \n\nwas not present in SW-Technosols (Figs. 4A and 4B) after the fourth month of incubation. \n\nAlthough the pH values have remained without any further change until the end of the experiment, \n\nthe leachates from SW-Technosols had pH values slightly higher than control leachates (especially at \n\nthe end of the experiment where leachates pH of all SW-Technosols was significantly higher than \n\ncontrol; Fig. 1B). This small increase in the pH can be related to the action of organic acids from \n\namendments which have some buffering capacity (data not shown) and/or inhibition of the sulfide \n\nminerals oxidation by the organic matter.  \n\nDuring the experiment, some SW-Technosols showed a decrease of EC in leachates when \n\ncompared to the control (except in the fourth month; Fig. 1D). After one and seven months of \n\nincubation, only leachates from S-A12 (EC: 1.9 mS/cm) and S-A30 (EC: 3.1 mS/cm), respectively, \n\npresented EC significantly different from control (2.9 and 3.8 mS/cm). However by the end of the \n\nexperiment (13 months), the EC in leachates from all SW-Technosols (3.6?4.7 mS/cm) were lower \n\nthan control (5.2 mS/cm).  \n\nIn general, no clear distinction was observed for doses application of 12 and 30 g/kg and type of \n\namendment mixtures in SW-Technosols. However, the Technosol S-A60 seems to have more \n\neffective results in the pH increase and reduction of EC in leachates. \n\n \n\nAnions concentrations in the leachates \n\n \n\nAnions concentrations in the leachates from SW and the respective Technosols are given in Figure \n\n2. The concentrations of anions in the simulated leachates were in the same range than those \n\nreported for acid mine drainage from the IPB (Abreu et al., 2008, 2010; S\u00e1nchez-Espa\u00f1a et al., 2005, \n\n2008).

In the control, the concentrations of As (17.7?38.4 mg As/kg ? 1.5?4.8 mg/L) and sulfate \n\n(37.9?136.1 g/kg ? 3.2?11.2 g/L) were larger than in the majority of the simulated leaching (1:20 m:V) \n\nfrom mineralized rock samples collected in Furtei gold mine (0.001?0.27 mg As/L and 0.3?1.97 g \n\nSO4/L; Da Pelo et al., 2009). However, the same authors also reported 10 mg As/L in the leachates of \n\nsome samples. These variations can be related to the heterogeneous composition of the sulfide-rich \n\nwastes. \n\nIn general, significant differences were observed in the anions concentrations of leachates from \n\nSW-Technosols and SW. During the experiment, As concentrations in the leachates from all SW-\n\nTechnosols, independently of the type and dose of amendments, decreased more than 63 % (mg/kg ? \n\nControl: 17.7?38.4; SW-Technosols: 0.05?9.8). However, for phosphates and sulfates, this behaviour \n\nwas only observed in some sampling periods. After one month of incubation, the SW-Technosols \n\nleachates also presented lower concentrations of phosphates and sulfates (0.2?6.3 mg PO4/kg and \n\n40.9?81.4 g SO4/kg) than the control (194.1 mg PO4/kg and 136.1 g SO4/kg). Only in the leachates \n\nsampled in the seventh month of incubation was observed the same behaviour for phosphates (mg/kg \n\n? Control: 60.3; SW-Technosols: 6.9?22.7). Nevertheless the leachates collected after four months of \n\nincubation from SW-Technosols with high dose application of amendment mixture (S-A60) contained \n\nless phosphates than those collected from the control and the other SW-Technosols (Fig. 2). \n\nAfter one month of incubation, the significant increase of the pH values in the leachates from SW-\n\nTechnosols seems to influence negatively the concentrations of phosphates and sulfates (rphosphate = \u2013\n\n0.72 and rsulfate = \u20130.83).  The decrease of the anions concentrations can be explained by the \n\ncrystallisation of metal arsenates (e.g. segnitite [Pb(Fe\n3+\n\n)3H(AsO4)2(OH)6)] and arsenbrackebuschite \n\n[Pb2(Fe\n2+\n\n,Zn)(AsO4)(HAsO4)(OH)]),  \n\nphosphates (e.g. berlinite (AlPO4) and corkite [Pb(Fe\n3+\n\n)3(PO4)(SO4)(OH)6]), and sulfates (e.g. \n\nalunogen [Al2(SO4)3\u202217H2O], linarite [Cu\n2+\n\nPb(SO4)(OH)2] and melanterite [Fe\n2+\n\nSO4\u20227H2O]) both in the \n\nsurface and/or in the core materials contained in the pots (Santos et al. 2014a). In general, the SW-\n\nTechnosols, independently of the type and dose of amendments, were efficient in the decrease of the \n\nanions spread to the surrounding environment.  \n\nSignificant variations in the anions concentrations occurred in all treatments during the experiment, \n\nhowever this fact was not explained only by pH values variation from leachates, but by the variation of \n\nall the elements concentrations, which can be saturated in relation to several solid phases. In general, \n\nsignificant increase of anions in leachates from SW-Technosols occurred between the first and fourth \n\nmonth of incubation as a result of the pH decrease.  \n\n \n\n\n\nPotential environmental impact of Technosols composed of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes from S\u00e3o Domingos mine: assay of \nsimulated leaching \n\n159 \n\n \n\na\n\na\n\na\na\n\nb\n\nbc\n\nc\n\nb\n\nb\n\nbc\n\nc\n\nb\n\nb c\nc cb\n\nbc\nb\n\nb\n\nb\nbc c\n\nbc\n\nb\nbc bc\n\nbc\n\nb\n\nbc\nc\n\nb\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\nA\ns\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\n\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n (\n\nm\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n)\n\nSW S-A12 S-A30 S-A60 S-B12 S-B30 S-C12 S-C30\n\na\n\nab\n\na a\n\nb\n\nabc\n\nd\n\na\n\nb\n\nabc\n\nbc\na\n\nb c\n\nb a\n\nb\n\nbc\ncd\n\na\n\nb\n\nbc\ncd\n\na\n\nb\nbc\n\ncd\n\na\n\nb\n\na\n\nbcd\n\na\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nP\nO\n\n4\nc\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/k\n\ng\n)\n\na\n\nab\n\nb\n\nab\n\na\n\nb\n\nbc\n\nab\n\nb\n\nab\n\ne\n\nb\n\na\nab\n\ncd\n\nb\n\nb\n\nab\nde\n\nab\n\nb\n\nab\n\ncd\n\nab\n\nb\nb\n\ncde\n\na\n\nab b\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n1 4 7 13\n\nS\nO\n\n4\nc\no\n\nn\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n)\n\nMonths of incubation\n\n \n\nSW: sulfide-rich wastes; S-A12, S-A30, S-A60: Technosol containing SW and AgW+AW+RW at 12, 30 and 60 g/kg; S-B12, S-\nB30: Technosol containing SW and AgW+CW+RW at 12 and 30 g/kg; S-C12, S-C30: Technosol containing SW and \nAgW+AW+CW+RW at 12 and 30 g/kg; AgW: agriculture wastes; AW: residue from the liquor distillation of A. unedo fruit; CW: \nresidue from liquor distillation of C. siliqua fruit; RW: rockwool used for strawberry crops. \n\nFig. 2 Variation with time of anion concentrations in simulated leachates from Technosols and gossan wastes \n\n(Mean \u00b1 SD; n = 3).

Taking \n\ninto account both seasonal and mine variability, simulated leachates from the SW  (control) had \n\nelements concentrations in the same range than acid mine drainage from the IPB (Abreu et al., 2008, \n\n2010; S\u00e1nchez-Espa\u00f1a et al., 2005, 2008). In general, cations concentrations (Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb and Zn) \n\nobtained in this study were smaller than those corresponding to water/acid soluble and exchangeable \n\nfraction in brittle pyrite wastes (379 mg Cu/kg, 19 mg Mn/kg and 494 mg Zn/kg; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al. \n\n2008), although some exceptions were observed for specific elements and sampling periods (e.g. Cu, \n\nMn and Zn after one month of incubation and Mn in the thirteenth month).  \n\nConcentrations of Ca (4.4?6.4 g/kg ? 386.4?529.5 mg/L) in the SW leachates were larger than \n\nthose in leachates from Furtei mine (45?162 mg Ca/L; Da Pelo et al., 2009). However, in simulated \n\nleachates (1:20 m:V) from mineralized rocks collected in Furtei mine dumps (Da Pelo et al., 2009), the \n\nconcentrations of Al, Cu, Fe and Na were in the same range than those in the leachates obtained from \n\nthe SW. The same authors reported smaller concentrations of Zn (0.17?1.8 mg/L; studied mine \n\nwastes (SW): 11.6?63.0 mg/L ? 128.9?767.2 mg/kg) than in the control (SW), while concentrations of \n\nPb and Mg were more than 200-fold higher than in the control (SW) (SW: 0.2?1.9 mg/L ? 2.5?21.0 \n\nmg/kg; 5.1?24.9 mg/L ? 56.8?301.3 mg/kg, respectively).  \n\nSignificant differences were observed among the concentrations of some cations in leachates from \n\nthe SW-Technosols and SW (Fig. 3). After one month of incubation, the amendment mixtures included \n\nin the SW-Technosols contributed to the improvement of the leachates quality. Thus, in these \n\nleachates, the concentrations of Al, Cu, Fe, Na and Zn decreased between 50 and 99 %, depending \n\non the element, when compared to those from the control (SW: 2.1 g Al/kg; 589.7 mg Cu/kg; 7.9 g \n\nFe/kg; 5.3 mg Na/kg; 767.2 mg Zn/kg). Although the immobilization of these cations can be related to \n\ntheir chelation, complexation and/or increase of exchangeable positions by organic matter addition \n\n(Adriano et al., 2004; Kumpiene et al., 2008), the increase of pH in the leachates (Fig. 1B), due to the \n\nacid neutralization by limestone rock wastes, seems to affect negatively the cations concentrations (rAl \n\n= \u20130.88; rCu = \u20130.82; rFe = \u20130.73; rZn = \u20130.83). In fact, leaching of Cu and Zn is strongly pH dependent \n\n(Kumpiene et al., 2008). \n\nThe addition of phosphate to the waste materials, through the nutrition solution included in the \n\nrockwool and other organic wastes, can also contribute to the formation of metal-phosphates and \n\nconsequently to the immobilization of the metals (Adriano et al. 2004; Hodson et al. 2001). In fact, \n\nsolid phases as corkite [Pb(Fe\n3+\n\n)3(PO4)(SO4)(OH)6] and berlinite (AlPO4) crystallised in the core of the \n\nsame sulfide materials amended with the mixtures AW + AuW + CW + RW applied at 12 and 30 g/kg \n\n(corresponding to Technosols S-C12 and S-C30; Table 1) (Santos et al., 2014a). \n\nThe Na concentrations (&lt;0.4?2.8 mg/kg) in the SW-Technosols leachates were always very low \n\nwhen compared to the SW during all the experiment (50?99 % decrease of Na).  \n\nCopper and Zn concentrations in some SW-Technosols leachates were higher (205.5?646.9 mg \n\nCu/kg; 123.5?538.7 mg Zn/kg, depending on sampling period) than in the SW (160.7?211.5 mg \n\nCu/kg; 128.9?179.6 mg Zn/kg). This is probably due to the presence of low molecular weight organic \n\n\n\nPotential environmental impact of Technosols composed of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes from S\u00e3o Domingos mine: assay of \nsimulated leaching \n\n161 \n\n \n\nacids liberated during the amendments organic matter decomposition, accelerated by the sulfuric acid \n\ngenerated from the oxidation of pyrite. This organo-metallic complexes are water soluble and mobile \n\n(Kabata-Pendias and Pendias, 2001) and can explain the increase of Cu and Zn in the leachates of \n\nthe SW-Technosols with time. The concentration of Fe in the SW-Technosols, after one month of \n\nincubation, is dramatically lower than in the SW leachates, what can be explained by the pH increase \n\nas a consequence of the limestone rock waste reaction with the acid generated by pyrite oxidation. \n\nThe effect of the increase of the pH was not so drastic in decreasing the concentration of Cu and Zn in \n\nthe leachates from the SW-Technosols collected one month after the incubation (Fig. 3). The Fe \n\nconcentrations were progressively increasing during the time span of the experiment due to the \n\ncombined effects of the pH decrease (as a consequence of limestone rock entire dissolution) and \n\ncontinuous Fe release from the pyrite oxidation.  \n\nAfter fourth and thirteen months of incubation, the concentrations of Al in SW-Technosols \n\nleachates were higher than in the SW. However, no clear tendency was observed related to the \n\namendment mixture and application dose. The use of rockwool, with high amount of Al (Tables 1 and \n\n2), in the amendment mixtures, and the low pH of the leachates collected after the first month of \n\nincubation (Fig. 1) can explain the increase of Al concentrations in the SW-Technosols leachates in \n\nrelation to those collected from SW. In spite of the possible dissolution of the rockwool used in the \n\namendments with release of Al to the acid solutions, the lower concentrations of the Al in the \n\nleachates of the SW-Technosols collected after one month of incubation, when compared to those of \n\nthe leachates from SW, can be explained by the variations of the pH of the leachates. The solution \n\nwith higher pH has lower concentrations of Al (Figs. 1 and 3).  \n\nUntil the fourth month of incubation all the leachates from SW and SW-Technosols had similar \n\nconcentrations of Pb (Fig. 3). After the seven month of incubation a positive contribution of the \n\namendments included in the SW-Technosols was observed decrease of more than 87 % of the Pb \n\nconcentration in the SW-Technosols leachates. The application of organic matter can promote the \n\nformation of organometallic complexes with Pb and the increase of the cationic exchange capacity of \n\nthe materials (Adriano et al., 2004). The existence of phosphates (from organic wastes and nutrient \n\nsolution included in the rockwool) can also justify the Pb concentration diminution in the leachates \n\n(Hodson et al. 2001). In fact, Santos et al. (2014a) reported not only berlinite (AlPO4) but also other \n\nsolid phases containing Pb, mainly belonging to the alunite\u2013jarosite-group (e.g. plumbojarosite \n\n[Pb(Fe\n3+\n\n)6(SO4)4(OH)12], and segnitite [Pb(Fe\n3+\n\n)3H(AsO4)2(OH)6]). Significant decrease of Pb \n\nconcentrations in the leaching solutions was also obtained by Ioannidis and Zouboulis (2005) when \n\nsynthetic and natural apatite was applied for the stabilization of simulated Pb-contaminated soils. \n\nThe concentrations of Ca and Mg in the leachates from SW-Technosols (4.9?10.9 g/kg and \n\n221.9?764.5 mg/kg, respectively) had larger values than control (4.4?6.4 g Ca/kg and 56.8?301.3 mg \n\nMg/kg) in all sampling periods (Fig. 3), as the result of the high concentrations of these elements in all \n\nthe used amendments (Table 2). The rate of reductive dissolution of Mn oxides by organic matter is \n\nincreased by lowering of pH (Sparks, 1995), which associated to the higher concentrations of Mn in \n\nthe amendments can explain the increase of Mn in the leachates from SW-Technosols after thirteen \n\nmonths of incubation (Table 2 and Fig. 3).  \n\n\n\nPotential environmental impact of Technosols composed of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes from S\u00e3o Domingos mine: assay of \nsimulated leaching \n\n162 \n\n \n\na\n\nc\n\nbc\nc\n\nbc\n\nabc\n\nc\n\nab\n\nbc\n\nab\n\nbc\n\na\n\nc\n\na\n\na\n\nb\nb bc\n\nbc\n\nab\n\nc\n\nab\n\nbc\n\na\n\nbc\n\nbc\n\nbc\n\nab\n\nbc\n\nab\n\nb\n\na\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\nA\n\nl \nc\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n)\nSW S-A12 S-A30 S-A60 S-B12 S-B30 S-C12 S-C30\n\nc c\n\nab\nd\n\nab a\n\na\ncd\n\nbc\n\nab\na\n\nab\n\na\n\nab\n\na abc\n\nab\nab\n\na\n\nabc\n\nab\n\nab\n\nab\n\nabc\n\nab\n\nab\n\nb\nbc\n\nab\n\nb\n\na a\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\nC\na\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n)\n\na\na\n\na\n\na\n\na\na\n\nb ba\na\n\nb b\na\n\na b b\na a\n\nb b\na a\n\nb b\na\n\na\n\nb b\na\n\na\n\nb b\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n1 4 7 13\n\nP\nb\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/k\n\ng\n)\n\nMonths of incubation\n\na\n\nb\nb d\n\nb a\n\nb\n\nbcd\n\ncd\n\na\n\nb\n\nab\n\nd\n\na a cd\n\nbc\nab b\n\nabc\n\nd\n\na b\n\na\n\nbcd\n\nab b\n\nabc\n\nbcd\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\n1000\n\nC\nu\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/k\n\ng\n)\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\nab\n\nb\n\nb\n\nc\n\nab\n\nb\n\nb\n\nc\n\nabc\n\nb c\nc\n\nc\n\nb\n\nb bc\n\nab\n\nb\n\nb\nc\n\nbc\n\nb\n\nb\n\nc\n\nab\n\nb\n\nb b\n\na\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nF\ne\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n)\n\nbc\n\na\nab\n\na\n\nb\n\nb\n\nab\n\na\n\na\n\nb\n\nbc\n\na\n\nc\n\nb\n\nab\n\na\n\nbc\n\nab\n\ncd\n\na\n\nc\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\nc\na\n\nd a\nc ab cd\n\na\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\nK\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/k\n\ng\n)\n\ne\n\nc bc\n\nc\n\ncd bc\n\nc\n\nb\n\nbcd\nb\n\nbc\n\nab\n\nb\n\na\n\na\na\n\ncd\n\nbc\n\nbc\n\nab\n\na\n\nb\n\nbc\n\na\n\nde\n\nbc\n\nbc\n\nb\n\nbc\nb\n\nb\n\nab\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\n1000\nM\n\ng\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/k\n\ng\n)\n\na a\n\na\n\na\n\nb\nb b b\n\nbc b b b\nbc\n\nb b bbc\nb\n\nb bc b b bc b b bc\nb b b\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nN\na\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/k\n\ng\n)\n\nb\n\nc c\n\nc\nb bc\n\nc\n\nab\n\nb b\n\nc\n\na\n\nb\n\na\n\na\n\nab\n\nb\nbc\n\nc\n\nab\n\nab\nb\n\nc\n\nc\n\nb\nbc\n\nc\n\nab\n\na\nb\n\nb\n\nbc\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\nM\nn\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/k\n\ng\n)\n\na\n\nc\n\nbc c\n\nb\n\nabc\n\nbc\n\nb\n\nde\n\nabc\n\nbc\n\nab\n\ne\n\na\n\nab\n\nb\n\nb\n\nbc\n\nc\n\nb\ncde\n\nab\n\nbc\n\nabbc\n\nbc\n\nc\n\nb\n\nbcd\nab\n\na\n\na\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\n1 4 7 13\n\nZ\nn\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/k\n\ng\n)\n\nMonths of incubation\n\n \n\nSW: sulfide-rich wastes; S-A12, S-A30, S-A60: Technosol containing SW and AgW+AW+RW at 12, 30 and 60 g/kg; S-B12, S-\nB30: Technosol containing SW and AgW+CW+RW at 12 and 30 g/kg; S-C12, S-C30: Technosol containing SW and \nAgW+AW+CW+RW at 12 and 30 g/kg; AgW: agriculture wastes; AW: residue from the liquor distillation of A. unedo fruit; CW: \nresidue from liquor distillation of C. siliqua fruit; RW: rockwool used for strawberry crops. \n\nFig. 3 Variation with time of cation concentrations in simulated leachates from Technosols and gossan wastes \n\n(Mean \u00b1 SD; n = 3).

The values of pH \n\nand EC obtained from GW leachates  were different  from those reported by Santos et al. (2013) to \n\nsoils developed on gossan materials collected in the same mine area. \n\nThe leachates pH and EC, for all the sampling periods and amendments application increased \n\nduring the experiments\u2019 time (Control ? pH: 4.2?4.4 and EC: 0.08?0.10 mS/cm, GW-Technosols ? pH: \n\n4.6?5.8 and EC: 0.12?0.45 mS/cm; Figs. 4B and 4D). Similar behaviour was reported by Alvarenga et \n\nal. (2009), by the application of different organic residues (municipal solid waste compost, garden \n\nwaste compost and sewage sludge), at 25, 50 and 100 Mg/ha (doses close to those applied in this \n\nstudy \u2013 30, 75 and 150 Mg/ha), to metal-contaminated soils from the Aljustrel mining area. However, \n\nSantos et al. (2013) found that for soils collected in the S\u00e3o Domingos mine and developed on gossan \n\nwastes amended with hydrophilic polyacrylate polymers occurred an increase of the pH of the \n\nleachates (Control: 6.1; Amended treatments: 6.9?7.1) while the EC in all the cases remained almost \n\nconstant (?0.06 mS/cm). \n\n After one month of incubation, significant differences were already obtained in pH and EC of the \n\nleachates from the GW-Technosols containing the 30 and 60 g/kg doses of amendments (pH: 5.0?5.5, \n\nEC: 0.16?0.26 mS/cm), when compared with the leachates from GW (pH: 4.2, EC: 0.08 mS/cm) (Figs. \n\n4B and 4D). However, after seven months, this significant improvement of pH was obtained in all \n\nleachates from the GW-Technosols independently of the application dose and the amendment mixture \n\n(pH: 4.8?5.8, Fig. 4B). In the same period, only leachates from Technosols G-A60 (EC: 0.45 mS/cm) \n\nand G-B30 (EC: 0.25 mS/cm), which received a high dose of amendment and with specific \n\namendment mixture (residue from the liquor distillation of A. unedo fruit and amendment application at \n\n60 g/kg and residue from liquor distillation of C. siliqua fruit and amendment application at 30 g/kg, \n\nrespectively), had higher EC than the control (0.08 mS/cm). Although EC had increased slightly in \n\nleachates from Technosols when compared with control (GW), these values were still small (&lt;0.45 \n\nmS/cm). No variation in the values of pH and EC in the leachates from each treatment were observed \n\nalong the time. \n\n \n\nAnions concentrations in the leachates \n\n \n\nAnions concentrations in the leachates from GW and respective GW-Technosols are shown in Figure \n\n5. In all sampling periods, leachates from some GW-Technosols had higher anions concentrations \n\nthan GW, but no clear tendency was observed for the amendment mixture and application dose of 12 \n\nand 30 g/kg. Nevertheless, GW-Technosol containing the amendment mixture at 60 g/kg (G-A60), \n\nusually released, by leaching, the highest amount of anions. The increase of chlorides, nitrates and \n\nphosphates in leachates from GW-Technosols is mainly related to the nutrient solution used in the \n\nstrawberry cultivation, which was incorporated in rockwool and agriculture wastes (Tables 1 and 2). \n\n\n\nPotential environmental impact of Technosols composed of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes from S\u00e3o Domingos mine: assay of simulated leaching \n\n \n\n164 \n\n \n\ne\nc\n\nd\nd\n\nbc\nc\n\nbcd bc\nabc\n\na\na\n\na\n\nbcd\nb abcab ab\n\na\n\ncd\nbc bc\n\nbc bc\nab\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\np\nH\n\n \nA GW G-A12 G-A30 G-A60 G-B12 G-B30 G-C12 G-C30\n\nc d c\n\nb\nabc\n\nbc\n\nb\n\nabc\n\nbc\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\nbc\n\nabcd\n\nbc\n\nab\n\nb\n\nb\n\nbc\n\ncd\n\nbc\n\nb\n\nabcd\n\nbc\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n1 4 7\n\nE\nle\n\nc\ntr\n\nic\na\n\nl \nc\n\no\nn\n\nd\nu\n\nc\nti\n\nv\nit\n\ny\n (\n\nm\nS\n\n/c\nm\n\n)\n\nMonths of incubation\n\nC\n\nd c e\n\ncd\n\nbc\ncd\n\nabc bc cd\n\na a a\n\nabc\nab bca ab\n\nab\n\nbcd\nbc d\n\nab ab cd\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7B\n\nd\nd c\n\nbcd\n\nbcd\nbc\n\nbc\n\nabc\n\nbc\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\nbcd\n\ncd\n\nbc\n\nb\n\nab\nb\n\ncd\n\ncd\n\nbc\n\nbc\n\nabcd\n\nbc\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n1 4 7\n\nMonths of incubation\n\nD\n\n \n\nGW: gossan wastes; G-A12, G-A30, G-A60: Technosol containing GW and AgW+AW+RW at 12, 30 and 60 g/kg; G-B12, G-B30: Technosol containing GW and AgW+CW+RW at 12 and 30 g/kg; \nG-C12, G-C30: Technosol containing GW and AgW+AW+CW+RW at 12 and 30 g/kg; AgW: agriculture wastes; AW: residue from the liquor distillation of A. unedo fruit; CW: residue from liquor \ndistillation of C. siliqua fruit; RW: rockwool used for strawberry crops. \n\nFig. 4 Variation with time of pH and electrical conductivity in simulated leachates from Technosols and gossan wastes (Mean \u00b1 SD; n = 4), after 15 min (A and C) and 24 h (B \n\nand D) of agitation.

Values from same sampling period followed by a different letter are significantly different (p &lt;\n\n0.05). \n\n \n\nAlthough the concentrations of anions in the leachates are different, compared to the present \n\nstudy, the increase of As and phosphate in leachates from soils developed on gossan materials \n\namended with polyacrylates was also observed (Santos et al., 2013). However, according to the same \n\nstudy, the same increase did not occur for chlorides, nitrates and sulfates. \n\nThe higher As concentrations in leachates from GW-Technosols (21.4?557.8 \u00b5g/kg depending on \n\ntreatment and sampling period) can be related to the increase of low-molecular-weight organic acids, \n\nderived from amendments application, which can release As from Fe\u2013, Mn\u2013 and Al\u2013oxides or \n\nhydroxides (Zang et al., 2005). In fact, soils developed on this mine waste in S\u00e3o Domingos mining \n\narea have 3\u201334 % and 0.01?0.4 % of the total As associated to Fe\u2013oxides and Mn-oxides, \n\nrespectively (Abreu et al., 2012; Santos et al., 2012). Another explanation to the increase of As \n\nconcentration in the leachates can be given by the presence of solid phases with low solubility, at \n\nlower pH, that can naturally exist in the gossan materials, like carminite (Fe2Pb(AsO4)2(OH)2), segnitite \n\n\n\nPotential environmental impact of Technosols composed of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes from S\u00e3o Domingos mine: assay of \nsimulated leaching \n\n166 \n\n \n\n(Fe3Pb(AsO4)(HAsO4)(OH)6) and kankite (FeAsO4\u20223.5H2O) (Santos et al., 2012). The solubility of \n\nthese solid phases increases with the increasing of the pH of their environment, as a result of their \n\nnon-congruent dissolution. The increase of As concentrations in those leachates can be related to the \n\ncomplex behaviour of the systems where new solid phases can be formed with different solubilities.   \n\nThe time evolution of the leachates anions concentrations showed no significant variations in the \n\nconcentrations of As (except for G-A12), phosphate (except for G-A12) and sulfate, independently of \n\nthe treatment. In general, chloride concentrations reached the highest values at the fourth month of \n\nincubation. For nitrates, it is apparent a decrease in their concentrations, but no clear tendency was \n\nobserved according to amendment dose and/or mixture. \n\n \n\nCations concentrations in the leachates \n\n \n\nCations concentrations in leachates from GW and respective Technosols are shown in Figure 6 \n\n(except Al, Cu and Pb). All leachates had concentrations of Pb (&lt;2.5 mg/kg), Al (in first and fourth \n\nmonth &lt;2.8 mg/kg) and Cu (seventh month &lt;0.5 mg/kg) below the detection limit of the apparatus.  \n\nConcentrations of the studied cations in leachates from GW were quite different from those \n\nreported by Santos et al. (2013). These variations will be related to the chemical composition of the \n\nwaste materials and despite being both classified as gossan materials, their heterogeneity is well \n\nknown. \n\nSimilar concentrations of Zn after one and seven months of incubation and Fe after one and four \n\nmonths of incubation were observed among treatments. However, Alvarenga et al. (2009) reported a \n\ndecrease of Zn in simulated leaching assays carried out in contaminated soils from Aljustrel mine area \n\nwhere organic wastes were applied.  \n\nAmendments application, independently of application dose and type, decreased significantly the \n\nCu concentrations (> 50 %) after one and four months, compared to control (?0.7 mg/kg), to values \n\nlower than detection limit. Similar results were observed by Alvarenga et al. (2009). In fact, organic \n\nmatter application can promote the formation of stable complexes with Cu and increase cationic \n\nexchange capacity (Adriano et al., 2004; Kumpiene et al., 2008).  \n\nLeachates from the GW-Technosols had higher concentrations of Ca, K, Mg, Mn and Na (more \n\nthan 20 %) than the control (mg/kg \u2013 Ca: 21.7?62.7, K: 41.0?64.7, Mg: 6.0?10.8, Mn:&lt;0.5?0.6, Na: \n\n5.3?25.0), especially after one and four month of incubation. All the amendments mixtures and \n\napplication doses originated the increase of Ca concentration in the leachates during all the \n\nexperiment. For the other cations, a different behaviour occurs and no clear tendency was observed \n\nwhatever the amendment mixture and/or application dose. Similarly to some anions behaviour, the \n\nhigh concentrations of these nutrients in leachates from the GW-Technosols were mainly related to \n\nthe nutrient solution incorporated in the rockwool (Tables 1 and 2). The increase of Fe concentration in \n\nthe leachates was also observed in soils developed on gossan materials amended with diapers \n\n(Santos et al., 2013). These authors also observed that the application of different types of \n\npolyacrylate did not alter the concentrations of Ca, K, Mg, Mn and Na in the leachates. \n\n \n\n\n\nPotential environmental impact of Technosols composed of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes from S\u00e3o Domingos mine: assay of \nsimulated leaching \n\n167 \n\n \n\n \n\nGW: gossan wastes; G-A12, G-A30, G-A60: Technosol containing GW and AgW+AW+RW at 12, 30 and 60 g/kg; G-B12, G-\nB30: Technosol containing GW and AgW+CW+RW at 12 and 30 g/kg; G-C12, G-C30: Technosol containing GW and \nAgW+AW+CW+RW at 12 and 30 g/kg; AgW: agriculture wastes; AW: residue from the liquor distillation of A. unedo fruit; CW: \nresidue from liquor distillation of C. siliqua fruit; RW: rockwool used for strawberry crops. \n\nFig. 6 Variation with time of cation concentrations in simulated leachates from Technosols and gossan wastes \n\n(Mean \u00b1 SD; n = 4).

Considering the concentrations of the potentially hazardous elements obtained \n\nin the simulated leachates and the total mass of GW and SW estimated in S\u00e3o Domingos mine (Tg ? \n\nSW: 0.20?0.27 and GW: 4.1?4.34; \u00c1lvarez-Valero et al., 2008; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2008), the total \n\namounts of the elements released by the mine wastes are presented in Table 3. \n\nSulfide-rich wastes can leach to the adjacent areas significant amounts of potentially hazardous \n\nelements. In general, the amounts of these elements were significantly lower than the values obtained \n\nby P\u00e9rez-Lopez et al. (2008), which considered the available fraction (soluble and exchangeable \n\nfraction) of the same elements in the wastes. Soluble fractions of Al, As, Fe and Pb represented less \n\nthan 7 % of the total concentrations of these elements, but other chemical elements, that can become \n\nhazardous, are mainly available (percentage of the available fraction compared to their total \n\nconcentrations ? S: 19?70; Cu: 8?28; Zn: 11?68). \n\nIn spite of the low values of the soluble fractions in the GW and respective Technosols (&lt;2.6 % of \n\ntotal concentrations depending on the element, treatment and sampling period) and of the elements \n\nconcentrations in the leachates (with or without amendments application), in each rainfall also can be \n\nleached significant amounts of hazardous elements for the adjacent areas due to the great total mass \n\nof this type of mine wastes that exist in S\u00e3o Domingos mine.  \n\nAlthough the total mass of SW is smaller than the mass of GW in the mine area, the high \n\nconcentrations of potentially hazardous elements leached from SW represent a greatest \n\nenvironmental impact in each rainfall. The circulation of water and leachates through SW, which \n\ngenerate acids by sulfides oxidation, amplified the environmental impact when compared to other \n\nmine wastes. \n\nIn general, the conception of GW-Technosols increases the amounts of some elements in the \n\nleachates. However, in the GW-Technosols, especially with application of the highest dose of the \n\namendments, the increase of organic matter and nutrient contents stimulate the \n\ndevelopment/colonization of vegetation (Santos et al., 2014b, 2015) in these soils. Consequently, this \n\ncan reduce the chemical elements leaching and the water flow to the deeper zones of the tailings \n\nreducing the wastes-water interaction. Nevertheless, Santos et al. (2015) referred that no vegetation \n\nwas able to grow in the SW-Technosols owing to the very low pH, as a result of continuous acid \n\ndrainage generation and low buffer capacity of the amendments. \n\n  \n\nComparison of methodologies to obtain leachates \n\n \n\nComparing the elements concentrations in the leachates obtained by the DIN method with those in \n\nthe leachates obtained by distilled water percolation (Santos et al., 2014a,  2015), it is evident the high \n\navailability of the chemical elements in the gossan (GW) and sulfide wastes (SW). Although the \n\nelements\u2019 concentrations in the leachates from SW are in the same range than the values reported for \n\nacid mine drainage from IPB (Abreu et al., 2008, 2010; S\u00e1nchez-Espa\u00f1a et al., 2005, 2008), \n\nsignificant differences between the elements concentrations in the leachates obtained by the two \n\n\n\nPotential environmental impact of Technosols composed of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes from S\u00e3o Domingos mine: assay of \nsimulated leaching \n\n169 \n\n \n\nabove referred methods were observed for the majority of the elements.  The same variation was \n\nobtained for the concentrations of the elements in the leachates from gossan wastes obtained with the \n\ntwo referred methodologies. \n\nEven being the DIN extraction a forced extraction method (Gomes and Pinto, 2006), the \n\nconcentrations of the elements in the simulated leachates were significantly smaller than in leachates \n\nobtained by water percolation (Santos et al., 2014a, 2015), independently of the mine wastes and \n\nconsequently their reactivity. Similar results were obtained with municipal solid wastes by Kocasoy \n\nand Murat (2009) but not with steelmaking slags (Gomes and Pinto, 2006).  \n\nSeveral factors can be associated to this variation between leaching methodologies, as for instance \n\nthe sample size, the particle size distribution, the solid:liquid ratio, and the duration of the leaching test \n\n(Chezom et al., 2013; F\u00e4llman and Aurell, 1996; Gomes and Pinto, 2006). The size of the waste \n\nparticles used in each method (&lt;2 mm in the DIN method and the total fraction of SW or &lt;1 cm for \n\nGW in the water percolation method), and the mechanic agitation can be considered the main origin of \n\nthe differences between the values of the elements concentrations in the leachates. The influence of \n\nparticle size in batch test was demonstrated by F\u00e4llman and Aurell (1996) for lead refractory slags. \n\nThe heterogeneity of the solid phases composing the mine wastes and consequently the surface \n\nare exposed to the water flow in the pots is larger, while the ratio solid:liquid is much smaller in the \n\npercolation method (1:0.08 m:V) than in the DIN extraction (1:10 m:V). In general, the water \n\npercolates through preferential channels, due to the large grain size of mine wastes.  \n\nIt should be noticed that during the experiment can occur several chemical processes, like \n\ncomplexation and/or adsorption/desorption (Gomes and Pinto, 2006) and even precipitation of \n\nsecondary minerals (F\u00e4llman and Aurell, 1996; Santos et al., 2014a) what can influence the \n\nconcentration of the elements in the simulated leachates. Nevertheless in a cycle of leaching-\n\nevaporation, different solid phases can be formed with stabilities determined by the environment, \n\nwhich can reduce or increase the elements concentrations according to the environment changes. In \n\nfact, in the percolation experiments with SW was identified a significant time evolution of the \n\nefflorescent salts and in solid phases in the pots' core materials (Santos et al., 2014a).The variation in \n\nthe primary and secondary minerals with different solubilities will change the concentrations of the \n\nelements in the leachates (F\u00e4llman and Aurell, 1996; Santos et al., 2014a).  \n\n\n\nPotential environmental impact of Technosols composed of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes from S\u00e3o Domingos mine: assay of simulated leaching \n\n170 \n\n \n\nTable 3 Mass (Mg) of elements leached from the sulfide-rich and gossan wastes and respective Technosols based on the concentrations of elements in simulated leachates \n\nand total mass of tailings in S\u00e3o Domingos mining area \n\n Al As Cu Fe Pb S Zn \n\nAssay 1 (Gossan wastes) \n\nGW&lt;11.7 0.02 ? 0.1&lt;2.2  ? 3.4 2.1 ? 3.7&lt;10.9 0.9 ? 1.3&lt;2.1 ? 4.1 \n\nG-A12&lt;11.7 0.01 ? 1.0&lt;2.2&lt;2.1 ? 6.6&lt;10.9 2.3 ? 2.9 2.8 ? 3.3 \n\nG-A30&lt;11.7 0.2 ? 0.5&lt;2.2&lt;2.1 ? 6.1&lt;10.9 3.0 ? 5.2&lt;2.1 ? 7.4 \n\nG-A60&lt;11.7 ? 20.9 0.6 ? 2.4&lt;2.2 3.1 ? 66.6&lt;10.9 3.6 ? 6.0&lt;2.1 \n\nG-B12&lt;11.7 0.5 ? 0.9&lt;2.2 2.8 ? 12.5&lt;10.9 1.9 ? 4.1&lt;2.1 \n\nG-B30&lt;11.7 0.3 ? 1.1&lt;2.2&lt;2.1 ? 20.3&lt;10.9 2.2 ? 5.7&lt;2.1 \n\nG-C12&lt;11.7 0.1 ? 0.2&lt;2.2 2.5 ? 4.5&lt;10.9 1.2 ? 2.0&lt;2.1 \n\nG-C30&lt;11.7 0.1 ? 0.3&lt;2.2&lt;2.1 ? 8.4&lt;10.9 2.5 ? 4.3&lt;2.1 \n\nAssay 2 (Sulfide-rich wastes) \n\nSW 48.6 ? 556 3.5 ? 10.4 32.1 ? 159 637 ? 2140 0.5 ? 5.7 2531 ? 12265 29.0 ? 207.1 \n\nS-A12 52.6 ? 377 0.1 ? 2.6 41.1 ? 100 49.9 ? 1193&lt;0.5 ? 0.7 2108 ? 7335 24.7 ? 154 \n\nS-A30 68.1 ? 412 0.02 ? 1.9 18.0 ? 153 2.9 ? 863&lt;0.5 ? 0.8 2027 ? 8008 25.7 ? 104 \n\nS-A60 33.8 ? 597 0.01 ? 0.5 12.6 ? 100 3.0 ? 240&lt;0.5 ? 0.7 3608 ? 7177 38.0 ? 145 \n\nS-B12 70.7 ? 340 0.1 ? 2.5 41.0 ? 133 4.3 ? 1185&lt;0.5 ? 0.7 2318 ? 7218 31.2 ? 139 \n\nS-B30 53.7 ? 436 0.01 ? 1.5 11.2 ? 170 1.4 ? 540&lt;0.5 ? 0.7 2469 ? 7746 36.5 ? 111 \n\nS-C12 78.7 ? 299 0.05 ? 1.5 29.4 ? 133 2.0 ? 1147&lt;0.5 ? 0.9 2485 ? 7840 29.1 ? 125 \n\nS-C30 108 ? 444 0.05 ? 2.6 28.0 ? 175 2.6 ? 1410&lt;0.5 ? 0.9 2741 ? 8897 53.9 ? 129 \n\nGW: gossan wastes; G-A12, G-A30, G-A60: Technosol containing GW and AgW+AW+RW at 12, 30 and 60 g/kg; G-B12, G-B30: Technosol containing GW and AgW+CW+RW at 12 and 30 g/kg; G-\nC12, G-C30: Technosol containing GW and AgW+AW+CW+RW at 12 and 30 g/kg; SW: sulfide-rich wastes; S-A12, S-A30, S-A60: Technosol containing SW and AgW+AW+RW at 12, 30 and 60 \ng/kg; S-B12, S-B30: Technosol containing SW and AgW+CW+RW at 12 and 30 g/kg; S-C12, S-C30: Technosol containing SW and AgW+AW+CW+RW at 12 and 30 g/kg; AgW: agriculture wastes; \nAgW: agriculture wastes; AW: residue from the liquor distillation of A. unedo fruit; CW: residue from liquor distillation of C. siliqua fruit; RW: rockwool used for strawberry crops \n\n\n\nPotential environmental impact of Technosols composed of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes from S\u00e3o Domingos mine: assay of \nsimulated leaching \n\n171 \n\n \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n\n \n\nBased on elements concentrations in simulated leachates and total mass of gossan (GW) and \n\nsulfide-rich wastes (SW) in S\u00e3o Domingos mine, both mine wastes generate great environmental \n\nimpact. The continuous oxidation of the sulfide minerals led to the formation of very acid solutions, \n\nwhich can release and afterwards leach high amounts of anions and cations. Although the GW had \n\nleached lower amounts of elements, compared to the SW, the extensive mass of the GW contribute to \n\nthe release of considerable amounts of potentially hazardous elements. Being the annual precipitation \n\nin S\u00e3o Domingos relatively small (559 mm), the tailings can still release continuously in each rainfall \n\nevent great amounts of potentially hazardous elements to the adjacent areas increasing the elements\u2019 \n\nconcentrations in soils and waters. \n\nThe amendments application improved the GW, decreasing their environmental impact, but the \n\nbeneficial effect of the amendments was not clear for the SW. However a clear influence of the dose \n\nand type of the amendments was not observed during the entire experiment. Although GW -\n\nTechnosols had leached more As when compared to the control, its concentrations were small. \n\nMoreover, the increase of pH and nutrients in leachates from these Technosols is an advantage in the \n\nrehabilitation process. In SW-Technosols, the amendments mixtures did not increase the pH of the \n\nleachates since the fourth month of incubation, owing to the absence of limestone rock waste, \n\nbecause the carbonates were dissolved in the reaction with the sulfuric acid generated by the pyrite \n\noxidation. Other organic and inorganic wastes and, possibly, their rate of application should be studied \n\nover a longer time span with the objective of increasing the pH of the leachates from SW, which \n\nseems to decrease the cations and anions concentrations in the leachates as was observed in the first \n\nmonth of incubation. \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors would like to thank: Madre Fruta (Hubel Group) for providing \n\nthe agriculture wastes and rockwool and Mr. Jos\u00e9 G.

Time evaluation \n\n177 \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\n \n\nGreenhouse pot experiments were conducted over 13 months to evaluate the effect of two \n\namendment mixtures doses (30 and 75 Mg/ha) on the geochemical dispersion of trace elements by \n\nleaching hazardous mine wastes from the S\u00e3o Domingos mine. Mineralogical evolution of these \n\nmaterials was also evaluated. Amendment mixtures containing solid wastes from agriculture (plant \n\nremains + strawberry substrate and rockwool used for the strawberry crop) and from distillation of \n\nCeratonia siliqua L. and Arbutus unedo L. fruits were used to improve the chemical characteristics of \n\nleachates from sulfide mine wastes. Sulfide mine wastes had acidic characteristics, as well as high \n\nelectrical conductivity and total elements concentrations (g/kg; Al: 54.8\u201361.2; Fe: 104.0\u2013110.0; Pb: \n\n9.0\u201313.8; S: 63.6\u201368.0; As: ?1). These features contributed to the large capacity for leaching of \n\nhazardous elements during, at least, the first four months of incubation. In the seventh month of \n\nincubation, there was a significant decrease in the leachates concentration of the majority of \n\nhazardous elements. The addition of amendments minimised trace elements dispersion in leachates \n\npercolation during the first seven months (25 to 99 % reduction compared to control, depending on the \n\nelement and sampling period). However, the leachates characteristics were not influenced by \n\namendments doses and no significant differences were observed in leachates composition (control \n\nand amended treatments) after 13 months. Amendments application led to differences between the \n\nsolid phases of the efflorescent salts formed on the surface of the control and the amended \n\ntreatments. The efflorescent salts contained very soluble Al sulfates, together with alunite-jarosite-\n\ngroup solid phases in amended samples, and copiapite-group solid phases in control. In the core \n\nmaterials (5 to 10 cm in depth), the mineralogy was similar in both control and amended samples. The \n\npresence of various stable solid phases from alunite-jarosite-group, such as jarosite and beudantite \n\n(mainly in deeper materials), can explain the low concentrations of trace elements in the leachates \n\nafter thirteen months. \n\n \n\nKEYWORDS Alunite-jarosite-group \u2022 Arsenic \u2022 Copiapite-group \u2022 Lead \u2022 Percolation leachates \n\n\n\nEffects of organic/inorganic amendments on trace elements dispersion by leachates from sulfide-containing tailings of the S\u00e3o \nDomingos mine, Portugal.

Time evaluation \n\n179 \n\n \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nThe intense mining activity in massive sulfides from Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB) generates different \n\ntypes of wastes. In the S\u00e3o Domingos mine (IPB) in Portugal, large dumps attaining approximately \n\n0.27 Tg, as well as modern and Roman slags and smelting ashes, contain pyrite-rich materials and \n\nother sulfides, which produce acid drainage all year round (\u00c1lvarez-Valero et al., 2008; Matos, 2004). \n\nThe production and circulation of acid mine leachates (or acid mine drainage \u2013 AMD) is a serious \n\nenvironmental problem in sulfide mine areas due to the extremely acidic conditions (frequently, pH &lt;\n\n1.5) they generate. The very low pH of the leachates promotes trace elements dispersion to adjacent \n\nareas, preventing the establishment of vegetation, as well as harming existing vegetation or other \n\norganisms that colonise neighbouring areas, thereby decreasing biodiversity (Abreu et al., 2010; Gil \n\nBueno et al., 1990; P\u00e9rez-Lopez et al., 2008; S\u00e1nchez-Espa\u00f1a et al., 2005).  \n\nThe AMD treatment in the IPB has been unsustainable due to its characteristics, namely, extreme \n\nacidity and high multitrace elements concentrations (S\u00e1inz et al., 2003). The large surface area of the \n\ntailings promotes sulfide oxidation and consequent AMD generation in a manner that is difficult to \n\ncontrol. These sulfide-containing tailings also show rill and gully erosion, and lack of vegetation due to \n\nthe high acidity and low fertility of these waste materials. \n\nDifferent organic and inorganic wastes, like red gypsum, sugar foam, sewage sludge, biosolids, fly \n\nashes, pig manure, marble wastes, etc., have been evaluated as amendments to improve some \n\nphysical, chemical and biological properties of mine tailings and contaminated soils (Basta et al., \n\n2001; Forsberg et al., 2008; P\u00e9rez-Lopez et al., 2008; Rodr\u00edguez-Jord\u00e1 et al., 2012; Zanuzzi et al., \n\n2009). Some amendments, such as waste compost and sewage sludge, can contain high \n\nconcentrations of hazardous trace elements that can increase the environmental risk of their \n\napplication. Therefore, their use should be carefully monitored.  \n\nDue to the different chemical behaviour of each trace element and the specific chemical and/or \n\nmineralogical composition of the amendments, selective immobilization and redistribution of trace \n\nelements in solid phases can be achieved efficiently (Rodr\u00edguez-Jord\u00e1 et al., 2010, 2012). \n\nThe application of amendment mixtures composed of several organic/inorganic wastes, instead of \n\nusing a single type, can be more efficient in the rehabilitation of mining areas that contain high \n\nconcentrations of several trace elements in tailings and highly contaminated leachates (Kumpiene et \n\nal., 2008). These amendment mixtures, which can make a Technosol in an attempt to create different \n\nsoil functions, can reduce trace element availability and their concentrations in mine waste leachates \n\n(Mac\u00edas, 2004) through the complementary effects of each amendment component. Several industrial \n\nor agro-industrial wastes, due to their intrinsic characteristics (high organic matter content and pH, and \n\nlow concentration of trace elements, etc.), large available quantities and cost effectiveness, can be an \n\neconomically attractive target to make a Technosol and a strategy for wastes valorisation (Mac\u00edas, \n\n2004). \n\nThe ecological rehabilitation of the S\u00e3o Domingos mine area can be achieved by minimising the \n\nleaching element concentrations and/or improving the chemical characteristics (for instance, increase \n\nin pH and decrease in salinity) of the leachates by remediation of mine wastes containing sulfides. The \n\n\n\nEffects of organic/inorganic amendments on trace elements dispersion by leachates from sulfide-containing tailings of the S\u00e3o \nDomingos mine, Portugal. Time evaluation \n\n180 \n\n \n\nuse of amendments can also contribute to plant colonisation and stimulation of biogeochemical \n\nprocesses that promote mine waste treatment and soil remediation (Abreu and Magalh\u00e3es, 2010). The \n\nsuccess of the multielemental contaminated mine areas rehabilitation depends on the combination of \n\nthe trace elements in tailings and the selection of adequate amendments (Kumpiene et al., 2008). \n\nLeachates from S\u00e3o Domingos and other mines in the IPB present multielemental contamination \n\n(Abreu et al., 2008, 2010; S\u00e1nchez-Espa\u00f1a, 2008; S\u00e1nchez et al., 2005). However, few studies are \n\navailable on the effects of amendments on the leaching of cations and anions from sulfide-containing \n\ntailings (P\u00e9rez-Lopez et al., 2007), and even less for periods of monitoring longer than one year. \n\nTherefore studies on the variation over time of the chemical composition of leachates, following \n\namendments addition to mine wastes, are environmentally relevant for future mine rehabilitation \n\nprojects. \n\nThis study aimed to evaluate the effect of two amendment mixtures (30 and 75 Mg/ha) on the \n\navailability of trace elements (cations and anions), which occurred at high concentrations in sulfide-\n\ncontaining tailings, over thirteen months. Understanding changes in geochemistry over time is \n\nessential in ensuring successful sulfide mine wastes rehabilitation. Examining mineralogical evolution \n\nof mine wastes as a consequence of leaching and the attainment of new equilibria were also a goal of \n\nthis study. \n\n \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n\nSite characterization \n\n \n\nSulfide mine wastes were collected from the S\u00e3o Domingos mine area, an abandoned mine \n\nlocated in the IPB and situated in the municipality of M\u00e9rtola, SE Portugal. Mining activities date from \n\nthe pre-Roman period with exploitation of Ag, Au and Cu, mainly in the gossan. However, modern \n\nexploitation (1857\u20131966) occurred both in the gossan and massive sulfides containing Cu, Zn, As and \n\nPb (Quental et al., 2002). The exploitation and extraction processes produced large amounts of \n\ndifferent mining wastes, which covered a surface area of around 3.2 x 10\n6\n m\n\n2\n (\u00c1lvarez-Valero et al., \n\n2008). In the Portuguese IPB, S\u00e3o Domingos is a severe case of the environmental impact of mining \n\ndue to the dimension of the areas affected by AMD and the volume of wastes and tailings (11 x 10\n6\n \n\nm\n3\n), with high concentrations of hazardous trace elements (\u00c1lvarez-Valero et al., 2008; Matos and \n\nMartins, 2006). The sampling area is located within the mine area, SW of the open pit, near the former \n\nleaching tanks. \n\n \n\nExperiment set-up \n\n \n\nComposite samples of the sulfide mine wastes (MW), containing mainly crushed pyrite and \n\nsmelting ashes, were collected in 2009. These materials were chosen due to their large amounts and \n\nwide distribution in the mine area, and their potential risk as a source of contamination (\u00c1lvarez-Valero \n\net al., 2008; Quental et al., 2002). In addition, the tailings are bared and exposed to severe water \n\nerosion. \n\n\n\nEffects of organic/inorganic amendments on trace elements dispersion by leachates from sulfide-containing tailings of the S\u00e3o \nDomingos mine, Portugal. Time evaluation \n\n181 \n\n \n\nThe amendments applied at 30 or 75 Mg/ha were mixtures containing distinct organic and \n\ninorganic wastes from: green agriculture (plant remains + strawberry substrate at 2:3 m/m) (AgrW), \n\nArbutus unedo L. (ArbW) and Ceratonia siliqua L. (CerW) fruit spirits distillation; and rockwool used for \n\nstrawberry crops (RW). Limestone rock wastes (LRW) with a particle size &lt;2 mm were also used at \n\n55 Mg/ha (except in control) to raise the mine wastes pH to ? 4. These organic and inorganic wastes \n\nwere used due to their physical and chemical characteristics and the fact that they can be easily \n\nobtained in large quantities at almost \u201czero cost\u201d from the vicinity of the mine. \n\nThe tailings and amendments were air-dried, mixed manually and potted. Microcosm assays were \n\nperformed in pots containing around 6 kg of mine waste materials (total fraction). Three treatments \n\nwere made (four replicates each): control with only mine wastes (MW); and MW + LRW + Amendment \n\ncomposed of AgrW + ArbW + CerW + RW (1:1:1:1) at 30 and 75 Mg/ha. All treatments were kept at 70 \n\n% of water-holding capacity under controlled conditions in a greenhouse. The pots were monitored for \n\nthirteen months. \n\n \n\nExperimental monitoring and sample analyses \n\n \n\nMultielemental concentrations of the initial sulfide-containing mine wastes (fraction &lt;2 mm) and \n\norganic/inorganic wastes were analysed by atomic emission spectrometry with induced plasma (ICP-\n\nOES) and instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) after acid digestion with HClO4 + HNO3 + \n\nHCl + HF in an international accredited laboratory (Actlabs, ISO/IEC 17025, Activation Laboratories, \n\n2011). The fraction &lt;2 mm was characterized for total concentrations of C and N (analysed by \n\ncombustion with a Leco analyser), as well as for electrical conductivity (EC) and pH, both in water \n\nsuspension (1:2.5 m/V) and extractable P and K (P\u00f3voas and Barral, 1992). Particle size distribution \n\nof mine wastes (total fraction) was also determined by sieving. \n\nMine waste materials (control) or the mixtures of MW and amendments were collected (0 to 5 cm of \n\ndepth) with a cylindrical probe, from each pot, after collection of the surface efflorescent salts. These \n\nsolids and the leachates obtained from deionised water percolation through the materials contained in \n\nthe pots were collected after one, four, seven and thirteen months of incubation. At the end of the \n\nexperiment (thirteen months), materials from all the treatments were also collected from a depth of \n\naround 10 cm. \n\nOnly the mine wastes (control) and amended mine wastes collected after one and thirteen months \n\nof incubation were air-dried, homogenised, sieved (&lt;2 mm) and analysed for pH, EC, total \n\nconcentrations of C and N by the same methodologies referred to above. Total concentration of S was \n\nalso determined by combustion with a Leco analyser. \n\nTo obtain leachates by percolation, the materials in the pots were irrigated with a volume of \n\ndeionised water that ensured an excess of 10 % of each pot\u2019s water holding capacity, and left to \n\npercolate for 24 h. The leachates were collected in plastic flasks linked to the bottom of the pot hole by \n\na plastic tube. The leachates were vacuum filtrated (&lt;0.45 \u00b5m), and pH and EC measured. The filtrate \n\nwas kept at \u201318 \u00baC. The leachates were analysed for: Al, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Pb and Zn total \n\nconcentrations by flame atomic absorption spectrometry; As by graphite furnace atomic absorption \n\n\n\nEffects of organic/inorganic amendments on trace elements dispersion by leachates from sulfide-containing tailings of the S\u00e3o \nDomingos mine, Portugal. Time evaluation \n\n182 \n\n \n\nspectrometry; sulfates by ion chromatography; and phosphates by visible spectrophotometry using the \n\nmolybdenum blue method (USEPA, 1979). \n\nEfflorescent salts were stored, after collection, in hermetic containers at room temperature far from \n\nthe sunlight. Mineralogical analysis of the efflorescent salts collected after one and thirteen months, as \n\nwell as of mine waste materials (total fraction) from the end of the experiment, was performed in \n\nrandom powder samples by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Cu K? radiation. The XRD analysis was \n\nperformed in samples separated under a binocular microscope, and selected by colour and general \n\nmorphological aspects (lustre, habit, etc.). In spite of the methodology used for mineral identification, \n\nthe samples were always heterogeneous and the solid phases were not easy to identify, owing to the \n\namount of lines obtained in the XRD spectra. The mineralogical analysis considered the elemental \n\ncomposition and the pH of the leachates, the known or foreseen solubilities of the solid phases, as \n\nwell as the temperature and relative humidity in the greenhouse. The same efflorescent salts were \n\nalso analysed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). \n\nAfter being analysed by XRD, the efflorescent salt samples and the mine waste materials were \n\nmixed with water (solid:water ratio of 0.033:10 and 1:10 (m/V), respectively), and shaken for 24 hours. \n\nThe chemical composition of the obtained aqueous solutions with pH &lt;3 was determined by high \n\nresolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (Actlabs, ISO/IEC 17025, Activation \n\nLaboratories, 2011b). \n\n \n\nData analysis \n\n \n\nStatistical analysis was performed with the statistical programme SPSS v18.0 for Windows. All data \n\nwere checked for homogeneity of variance and normality (Shapiro-Wilk test) and, when possible, a \n\none-way ANOVA was applied. Data not satisfying assumptions for ANOVA were analysed non-\n\nparametrically using Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA by a rank test. Significant differences (p &lt;0.05) were \n\nanalysed by a post-hoc Tukey\u2019s test. For statistical purposes, the results below the detection limit were \n\nassumed as half of the detection limit. Bivariate Pearson correlations were used to correlate the \n\nmaterials and leachates characteristics (r > 0.95). Quality control of the analysis was undertaken by \n\nanalytical replicate samples and laboratory standards at the international accredited laboratory \n\n(Activation Laboratories).  \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nCharacterization and time evolution of solid materials  \n\n \n\nMine wastes are, in general, complex mixtures of heterogeneous materials, but the sulfide wastes \n\ncollected from the S\u00e3o Domingos area did not show high variability in their chemical characteristics. \n\nThese mine wastes presented a pH ? 2, large EC (7.4 to 7.5 mS/cm) and low fertility (Table 1). The \n\nlarge total carbon concentration in mine wastes was related to the considerable presence of smelting \n\nashes and small pieces of charcoal.

Time evaluation \n\n184 \n\n \n\nDomingos. The physical and chemical characteristics of the mine wastes were associated with their \n\npredominant composition \u2013 materials containing sulfides, potential AMD generators.  \n\nAll the organic and inorganic wastes used as amendments presented chemical characteristics \n\nconsidered beneficial and safe for land application and rehabilitation of mine wastes. Concentrations \n\nof total nitrogen and extractable phosphorus and potassium, in addition to pH values, were larger than \n\nthose in mine wastes (Table 1), while the lowest EC was observed (0.2 to 3.5 mS/cm) in all the \n\namendments. Wastes from spirits distillation (ArbW and CerW) showed the highest total carbon \n\nconcentrations (436.7 to 442.6 g/kg). Concentrations of trace elements in the amendments were much \n\nlower than those in mine wastes (Table 2). \n\nAfter one month of incubation and at the end of the experiment (thirteen months of incubation), \n\namendments addition improved the structure of the materials by increasing the organic matter content \n\nand consequently raising the water-holding capacity. The amendments reduced EC by 31 to 53 % \n\ncompared to control (Table 3). The pH of the amended mine wastes increased to 3.5\u20133.6 and ~2.1 \n\nafter one and thirteen months of incubation, respectively (Table 3) despite the presence of limestone \n\nrock wastes (in the initial composition of the amendments. However, when materials/water \n\nsuspensions (1:10 m/V) from the first month of incubation were shaken for one and five days at room \n\ntemperature, the measured pH were ~2.2 for control (for both shaking times) and 4.2-4.5 and 5.3-7.0 \n\nfor one and five days, respectively, for the amended samples. Similar shaking experiments performed \n\nwith materials after four months of incubation presented pH values (2.1 &lt;pH &lt;2.5) in the same range \n\nas that of the collected leachate percolations (Fig. 1). Zanuzzi et al. (2009) in another microcosms \n\nassay involving the Brunita mine tailings pond, observed an increase in the pH of the materials \n\nfollowing the addition of amendments, even after 24 months, from 2.8 (treatment not amended) to 7.3 \n\n(application of marble wastes + pig manure or marble wastes + sewage sludge). However, those \n\nauthors applied larger doses (166.7 Mg/ha) of marble wastes with larger particles (&lt;2 mm: 26 %; 2\u20135 \n\nmm: 74 %), compared to the present study (55 Mg/ha, &lt;2 mm: 100 %). The comparison of the pH \n\nvalues gotten in this work,  for the shaken materials/water suspensions, with the results of Zanuzzi et \n\nal. (2009) show that the presence of  limestone in the amendments increases the pH to values higher \n\nthan four. Thus, the pH lower than four, measured in this work, in the leachates from the amended \n\nmaterials, after one month of incubation, indicate that the limestone could not be in contact with the \n\nsurrounding aqueous medium. This can be explained by the formation of a layer of calcium sulfate on \n\nthe surface of the limestone grains. The Ca sulfate is the product of the reaction between the calcium \n\ncarbonate and the sulfate ion present in the acid solutions generated by the pyrite oxidation. The \n\ncalcium sulfate surface layer was dispersed after shaking, promoting the contact between the \n\nlimestone and the aqueous solution, increasing the pH of the materials/water suspensions. However, \n\nafter the fourth month of incubation the limestone was already dissolved once there was no change in \n\nthe pH of the shaken materials/water suspensions. The decrease in the limestone effect at the \n\nbeginning of the incubation, due to its reaction with the generated acidic leachates, was favoured by \n\nthe small grain size (&lt;2 mm) of the used material, which was therefore one disadvantage of this \n\namendment. In fact, the kinetics of the limestone reaction increases when the size of the solid \n\nparticles decreases. During the entire experiment, the acidity of mine wastes increased in all \n\n\n\nEffects of organic/inorganic amendments on trace elements dispersion by leachates from sulfide-containing tailings of the S\u00e3o \nDomingos mine, Portugal.

However, EC was only reduced in the experiments with pyritic \n\nsludge (0.30 mS/cm). Rodr\u00edguez-Jord\u00e1 et al.

(2007, pH ? 2; EC: 2\u20134 mS/cm). However, the \n\npresent work results were in the same range as those reported for acid mine drainages in the IPB \n\n(Abreu et al., 2010; Sanchez-Espa\u00f1a et al., 2005, 2008).  \n\nThe large quantity of sulfides in the mine wastes used in the present study can be one of the \n\npossible explanations for the great differences observed in leachates pH between this work data and \n\nthose obtained by Forsberg et al. (2008) for Aitik Cu mine tailings containing only traces of metal \n\nsulfides whose pH ranged between 3.5 and 7.5. \n\nUntil the seventh month of incubation, the decrease of the leachates pH was observed in all the \n\ntreatments. However, pH values at the end of the experiment (thirteen months) were similar to those \n\nof the first month of incubation. This represented a pH increase, between the seventh and thirteenth \n\nmonth of incubation, from 1.15 to 1.55 for control, and from ? 1.9 to ? 2.3 for amendment-treated \n\nsamples. The decrease of the pH of the leachates during an experimental period of 630 days was also \n\nobserved by Forsberg et al. (2008) in the Aitik Cu mine tailings leaching. \n\nRegarding EC, the control samples exhibited a different trend compared to amended ones. Control \n\nEC values were in the same range as those reported for AMD from some IPB mines (Abreu et al., \n\n2010; Sanchez-Espa\u00f1a et al., 2005, 2008). Control showed significant variations in EC, with a 2.5\u2013fold \n\n\n\nEffects of organic/inorganic amendments on trace elements dispersion by leachates from sulfide-containing tailings of the S\u00e3o \nDomingos mine, Portugal.

In the leachates from the \n\ncontrol, the highest values of EC (Fig. 1) were measured in the fourth month, which agrees with the \n\nmajority of the elemental total concentrations measured by other techniques. In treatments with \n\namendments, the values of EC in the first and fourth months of incubation (11.3 and 21.1 mS/cm, \n\nrespectively) were not significantly different, but in the following months, a significant and progressive \n\ndecrease was observed, reaching a value of around 4 mS/cm in the thirteenth month. The sampling \n\nmade after one month of incubation occurred in spring, while the fourth and seventh month samplings \n\noccurred in summer. During spring and summer, the strong evaporation contributed to continuous \n\ncrust formation of salts crystallising on the materials\u2019 surface. Irrigation usually caused complete \n\ndissolution of the efflorescent salts, but this was not complete during the warmest months, increasing \n\nthe thickness of the surface crusts. The rise in the amount of surface salts could have contributed to \n\nthe EC reduction observed during the experiment in all the treatments, as a result of a decrease in the \n\nconcentrations of dissolved ions. \n\nIn terms of the possible biogeochemical rehabilitation effect, the increase of the amendment doses \n\nfrom 30 to 75 Mg/ha did not significantly modify the leachates characteristics originated by the waste \n\nmaterials. The environmental impact of the mine wastes leachates is still very high. \n\n \n\nAnions and cations concentrations \n\n \n\nThe water in contact with the mine wastes promoted the oxidation of the sulfide minerals, resulting \n\nin the formation of acid solutions and the consequent leaching and release of high amounts of cations, \n\nand anions containing mainly As and S. The leachates collected from control presented a typical \n\nmultielemental AMD composition (Figs. 2 and 3) from the IPB (taking in account both seasonal and \n\nmine variability) (Abreu et al., 2008, 2010; S\u00e1nchez-Espa\u00f1a et al., 2005, 2008) and the Valdarcas \n\nmine in the north of Portugal (Valente and Gomes, 2009). \n\nTotal concentrations of anions and cations in leachates were not related to their total \n\nconcentrations in the mine wastes. However, the very low concentrations of phosphates (Fig. 2) in the \n\nleachates collected from the control suggested a low total concentration of these ions in mine wastes \n\n([phosphate]total = 1.01 g PO4/kg). No significant variations in phosphate concentrations were observed \n\nwith time in the control (Fig. 2, 1.35\u201317.82 mg PO4/L). \n\nThe amendments contributed to a significant increase in the phosphate total concentrations in the \n\nleachates (15.23\u201398.25 mg PO4/L), compared to the control (1.35\u201317.82 mg PO4/L), at least for the \n\nfirst three sampling periods (Fig. 2). The phosphates in the amendments (Table 1) were linked to the \n\norganic matter and nutrient solution incorporated into the rockwool, which came from strawberry \n\ncultivation in greenhouses. The amendments maintained leachate phosphate levels between 69.04 \n\nand 98.25 mg PO4/L, until the seventh month of incubation. A significant reduction of more than 63 % \n\nwas observed in the phosphate concentration (15.23 and 30.96 mg PO4/L for 30 and 75 Mg/ha, \n\nrespectively) after the thirteenth month.

However, these authors noted an \n\nincrease in the total concentrations of As and Pb in leachates after amendments application, which are \n\nin contrast to the results of the present study. \n\nThe total concentrations of As and Fe in the leachates from amended samples showed no \n\nsignificant variations with time. There was no noticeable decrease in the first month, in the \n\nconcentrations of Ca, K and Na in these leachates when compared to control, with Na and K exhibiting \n\nvery low concentrations in the leachates from amended samples all the time (Fig. 3). However, Ciccus \n\net al. (2001) and P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al. (2007) observed an increase in the total concentrations of Ca, K \n\nand Na in leachates from amended treatments. \n\nThe concentration of Mg in the leachates from control was lower than that in the leachates from \n\nsamples treated with 75 Mg/ha of amendments in the first month, due to the fact that the amendments \n\nhad high total concentration of Mg (Table 2 and Fig. 3). \n\nWith the exception of As and K, whose highest concentrations in leachates from control samples \n\nwere found in the first and seventh months, respectively, the highest concentrations of Al, Ca, Cu, Fe, \n\nMg, Mn, Na, Pb, Zn and sulfate were measured in the fourth month (Figs. 2 and 3). At the end of the \n\nexperiment, the total concentrations of Al, As, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Zn and sulfate in the leachates from \n\ncontrol matched their concentrations in the leachates from the amended samples. In opposition to the \n\npresent work results, no regular pattern was reported by Forsberg et al. (2008) in the concentrations of \n\nAl, Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn in leachates from Aitik mine tailings; however, they did note a progressive \n\nincrease in their concentrations with time. \n\nThe total concentrations of K, Na and Pb in the leachates from control were always significantly \n\nhigher than those in the leachates from amended samples, even at the end of the experiment (Fig. 3). \n\nFigures 2 and 3 show that the increasing the dose of amendments did not significantly affect the \n\nmultielemental composition of the leachates.

Time evaluation \n\n191 \n\n \n\nIn general, concentrations of cations in leachates were variable and difficult to predict and explain, \n\ndue to the complexity of solid-phase trace elements composition and concentrations, aqueous solution \n\ncharacteristics, rates of acid generation relative to neutralisation, and the possible existence of various \n\nphysico-chemical conditions (Sullivan and Yelton, 1988). In the present work, a decrease in the \n\nconcentrations of the hazardous chemical elements was evident with time, but P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al. \n\n(2007) found an increase in Pb concentration from 3 to 35 mg/L in leachates from pyritic sludge. \n\nRodr\u00edguez-Jord\u00e1 et al. (2012) also observed an increase in As concentrations, with time in leachates \n\nfrom S\u00e3o Domingos sediments amended with sugar foam + biomass ash. Cao et al. (2003), Forsberg \n\net al. (2008), P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al. (2007) and Rodr\u00edguez-Jord\u00e1 et al. (2012) reported, as in the present \n\nwork, decreased concentrations of several chemical elements in leachates following the application of \n\namendments. However, Forsberg et al. (2008) reported that adding sewage sludge to mine tailings \n\nfrom Aitik copper mine did not lead to the immobilisation of Al, Cu, Mn and Pb during all leaching \n\ncycles. The different results obtained with different amendments could be attributed to the elemental \n\nchemical composition as well as to the physico-chemical properties of the amendments and \n\nsubstratum (soils and/or mine wastes) (McBride, 2003). Systems with different chemical compositions \n\npromote different behaviours. \n\nThe amendments obviously interact with the mine waste materials. For example, limestone reacts \n\nwith the acid generating media and also organic matter. In spite of the small increase in pH of mine \n\nwaste leachates following amendments application, interactions between the mine wastes and \n\namendments can be perceived. The experiments discussed in Section 3.1 show that limestone was \n\nnot present in the amended materials in the fourth month of incubation. On the other hand, the organic \n\nmatter of the amendments can be oxidized, originating weak organic acids with some buffering \n\ncapacity. The small increase in pH of the leachates from amended mine wastes, when compared to \n\ncontrol, can be explained by the action of those organic acids. The organic matter can also inhibit the \n\npossible oxidation the sulfide minerals. Residues of crystalline organic compounds were proposed in \n\nthe preliminary computer analysis of the X-ray diffractograms of the amended wastes, described in \n\nSection 3.3. The decrease of the total concentrations of As and sulfate in the leachates from amended \n\nsamples following the addition of organic matter is not easy to explain by surface adsorption \n\nmechanisms, since the presence of mainly negatively charged organic molecules or ions will not \n\nattract the negatively charged As or S containing ions. Hydronation of organic molecules can occur at \n\nlow pH, but As ions are also hydronated into neutral species, diminishing the possibility of surface \n\nadsorption. Fitz and Wenzel (2002) stated that they did not see evidence of the organic matter \n\ncontribution to the sorption of significant amounts of As in soils. The same mechanism of hydronation \n\nof organic groups neutralising their negative charges or even, at very low pH, becoming positively \n\ncharged could explain the possible lack of sorption of the positive metal ions in very acidic media. \n\nBesides the sorption mechanisms, ions can be immobilised by the formation of insoluble secondary \n\nsolid phases (metal arsenates) (Abreu et al., 2009; Kabata-Pendias and Pendias, 2001; Kumpiene et \n\nal., 2008; Santos et al., 2012). The decrease of the total concentrations of Al, Cu, Fe, K, Mn, Na, Pb \n\nand Zn in the leachates from samples treated with both doses of amendments, compared to control, is \n\nalso well explained by the crystallisation of solid phases. \n\n\n\nEffects of organic/inorganic amendments on trace elements dispersion by leachates from sulfide-containing tailings of the S\u00e3o \nDomingos mine, Portugal. Time evaluation \n\n192 \n\n \n\nDuring thirteen months of incubation, the sulfide materials (Table 2) from control lost cumulatively \n\nin the leachates, 4.8 % of their total concentration of S and ~1.7 % of their total concentrations of As \n\nand Fe (Figs. 2 and 3). However, after amendments application, the fraction of these elements lost by \n\nleaching from the sulfide materials decreased significantly to about 2.5 % of the total concentration of \n\nS and less than 0.5 % for As and Fe. \n\n \n\nMineralogical characterization \n\n \n\nThe maintenance of the water-holding capacity during the experimental periodkept the core \n\nmaterials continuously wet in an acidic media, promoting the dissolution of some solid phases and the \n\ncrystallisation of new ones with compositions different from those of the parent materials. The contact \n\nof the constantly moist mine waste with atmospheric oxygen promoted the oxidation of sulfide \n\nminerals, the decrease of the pH of the leachates, minerals dissolution, and chemical elements \n\nleaching. Hazardous chemical elements can be retained by the formation of secondary solid phases or \n\nbecome available depending on the composition of the leaching solutions. Hazardous chemical \n\nelements retention in the solid phases can be explained by the crystallisation of metal arsenates, \n\nphosphates and sulfates. The most soluble solids, under specific chemical and physical conditions, \n\ncrystallise at the surface as efflorescent salts, while the less soluble solids crystallise in the core \n\nmaterials contained in the pots. However, the solubility of arsenates and phosphates strongly depends \n\non pH as a result of the hydrolysis of the anions and consequent displacement of the chemical \n\nequilibria related to the dissolution processes. The very acidic aqueous solutions have very high \n\nleaching capacities and can dissolve the solid arsenates and phosphates with low solubility in almost \n\nneutral aqueous solutions. These solutions move to the surface by the capillarity phenomena and the \n\nvery soluble solid phases then crystallise due to water evaporation. \n\n \n\nEfflorescent salts \n\n \n\nThe formation of efflorescent soluble salts on the materials of the surface of each pot began when \n\nthe atmospheric temperature increased and air humidity decreased, promoting dryness of the surface, \n\nin spite of the constant watering to meet the water-holding capacity of the materials inside the pots. \n\nThe thickness of the surface crust was higher in the control than in the amended samples as a \n\nconsequence of the higher ionic concentrations in the control pore aqueous solution. In all pots, the \n\nthickness of the surface crusts increased during the hottest months, undergoing partial re-dissolution \n\nduring irrigation. Under similar atmospheric conditions, in the Iberian Pyrite Belt mining areas, very \n\nsoluble crusts are formed on the surfaces of mine wastes, leaching lagoon banks and beds, and river \n\nbeds (Abreu et al., 2010; Romero et al., 2006). However, the first rainfalls completely dissolve the \n\nefflorescent salts, leading to increased levels of trace elements in the mine drainage water (Abreu et \n\nal., 2010; \u00c1lvarez-Valero et al., 2007; Nieto et al., 2007; S\u00e1nchez-Espa\u00f1a, 2008; S\u00e1nchez-Espa\u00f1a et \n\nal., 2005). \n\n\n\nEffects of organic/inorganic amendments on trace elements dispersion by leachates from sulfide-containing tailings of the S\u00e3o \nDomingos mine, Portugal. Time evaluation \n\n193 \n\n \n\nDifferent efflorescent salts were identified depending on the pH and other ionic composition of the \n\ncrystallisation medium, presence or absence of organic matter, and the duration of contact between \n\nthe water and solid phases. Air temperature and humidity can also influence the composition of the \n\nefflorescent solid phases.  \n\nAfter one month of incubation, the efflorescent salts of the control were identified as the secondary \n\nnew phases aluminium sulfates (Al2(SO4)3\u202216-17H2O), aluminocopiapite \n\n((Al2/3x,Fe1?x\n2+\n\n,V1/3x)(Alx,Fe1?x\n3+\n\n)4(SO4)6(OH)2\u202220H2O) and aluminocoquimbite ((Alx,Fe1-x)2(SO4)3\u20229H2O) \n\nwith different degrees of substitution of Al in the Fe positions (Fig. 4). The data presented in Table 4, \n\nobtained from the dissolution of the efflorescent salts, show that these solid phases must contain \n\nmainly Al and Fe. Some of the other chemical elements presented in the Table 4 can be in the lattice \n\nof the reported solid phases in trace amounts.

Some of \n\nthese minerals, e.g., coquimbite, aluminocopiapite, ferricopiapite, rozenite and poitevinite, were also \n\nreported in mine wastes from S\u00e3o Domingos (Abreu et al., 2010; \u00c1lvarez-Valero et al., 2007; \n\nS\u00e1nchez-Espa\u00f1a, 2008), other IPB mines and the Valdarcas mine (Romero et al., 2006; S\u00e1nchez-\n\nEspa\u00f1a, 2008; S\u00e1nchez-Espa\u00f1a et al., 2005; Valente and Gomes, 2009). Copiapite-group minerals \n\nare common in the extremely acid environments of sulfide mine areas, where associations with iron \n\nsulfates such as melanterite and coquimbite are frequent (Jamison et al., 2005a; Romero et al., 2006). \n\nThe pH values of the waste materials in the control (Table 3) in the first and thirteenth months, \n\ncoupled with the pH values of the leachates collected from control (Fig. 1), indicate that all the solid \n\nphases crystallised on the materials of the surface of the control samples are stable under extremely \n\nacidic conditions (pH &lt;1.5), as the abovementioned field data also corroborate (Abreu et al., 2010). \n\nThe pH of the pore waters at the surface of the materials in the control decreased as the superficial \n\nwater evaporated, increasing the concentrations of the dissolved ions and promoting the crystallisation \n\nof very soluble salts. \n\nIn the efflorescent secondary salts following amendments treatments (30 and 75 Mg/ha) after one \n\nmonth of incubation, mainly aluminium-, copper- and iron-containing sulfates, such as alum-K \n\n(KAl(SO4)2\u202212H2O), alunogen (Al2(SO4)3\u202217H2O), beaverite (Pb(Cu\n2+\n\n,Fe\n3+\n\n)3(SO4)2(OH,H2O)6), \n\nhalotrichite (Fe\n2+\n\nAl2(SO4)4\u202222H2O), linarite (Cu\n2+\n\nPb(SO4)(OH)2) and melanterite (Fe\n2+\n\nSO4\u20227H2O), were \n\nidentified (Fig. 6). The chemical composition of the minerals agrees with the data presented in Table4. \n\nAfter thirteen months of incubation, arsenate, oxalate, phosphate and sulfate minerals were \n\nidentified in the efflorescent salts crystallising on the amended materials (Fig. 7): several minerals \n\nfrom the alunite-jarosite-group [beaverite, beudantite (Pb(Fe\n3+\n\n)3(AsO4)(SO4)(OH)6), corkite \n\n(Pb(Fe\n3+\n\n)3(PO4)(SO4)(OH)6), (hydronium-, natro-) jarosite (H3O,K,Na)(Fe\n3+\n\n)3(SO4)2(OH)6), \n\nplumbojarosite (Pb(Fe\n3+\n\n)6(SO4)4(OH)12), chenite (Cu\n2+\n\nPb4(SO4)2(OH)6)], epsomite (MgSO4\u20227H2O), \n\ngypsum (CaSO4\u20222H2O), humboldtine (Fe\n2+\n\nC2O4\u20222H2O), moolooite (Cu\n2+\n\nC2O4\u2022nH2O (0 &lt;n &lt;1)) and \n\nweilite (Ca(HAsO4)).

This is due to the increase in water activity, which consequently raises the pH. The pH of the \n\nleachates collected from amended samples was higher (2.0 &lt;pH &lt;2.5) than that of the leachates \n\nfrom control (Fig. 1). \n\nThe stability field diagram of melanterite (Knoll et al., 2005) shows that this solid phase can be \n\nassociated with minerals of the alunite-jarosite group, which are stable phases at a pH between 1.5 \n\nand 4 (Knoll et al., 2005), as well as with minerals of the copiapite-group, which only exist at a pH<1.5. \n\nHumboldtine and moolooite can be formed by the reaction of metal ions with the oxalic acid \n\nproduced by the fungi that grew in the organic amendments during the present experimental assay. \n\nGadd (1999) analysed the biogeochemical importance of the sparingly soluble iron and copper \n\noxalates produced by fungi.  \n\n\n\nEffects of organic/inorganic amendments on trace elements dispersion by leachates from sulfide-containing tailings of the S\u00e3o \nDomingos mine, Portugal.

Several solid phases or solid solutions (with different degrees of metal ions \n\nsubstitution) belonging to the alunite-jarosite-group [beaverite, beudantite, (hydronium-, natro-, \n\nplumbo-) jarosite and segnitite (Pb(Fe\n3+\n\n)3H(AsO4)2(OH)6)] were the most common both in control and \n\namended samples. Belonging to the alunite-jarosite-group, it is probable that philipsbornite \n\n(PbAl3H(AsO4)2(OH)6) crystallises in the control (Fig. 9), and corkite in the amended samples (Fig. 10). \n\nIn addition to the abovementioned solid phases, it is highly likely that arsenbrackebuschite \n\n\n\nEffects of organic/inorganic amendments on trace elements dispersion by leachates from sulfide-containing tailings of the S\u00e3o \nDomingos mine, Portugal.

The pH values of the waste materials (Table 3) and the leachates during the thirteen months \n\nof incubation (Fig. 1) indicate that all the core solid phases were under conditions (pH > 1.5) that \n\npromoted the crystallisation of the observed solid phases. The wastes in the pots core were kept \n\nmoistened (water-holding capacity), but were not waterlogged during the time span of the experiment. \n\nThis allows the creation of very localised microsystems with very specific and different environments \n\n(e.g., moist content and oxidation-reduction potential) generated by the pore system (different pore \n\nsizes), creating a diversity of chemical conditions (pH, aqueous ionic concentrations, water activity) \n\nthat can produce multiple solid phases stable under each particular condition. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 9 X-ray diffractograms of the minerals identified in control mine waste materials, collected in two depths (A: \n\n<5 cm; B: ?10 cm) after thirteen months of incubation.  \n\n\n\nEffects of organic/inorganic amendments on trace elements dispersion by leachates from sulfide-containing tailings of the S\u00e3o \nDomingos mine, Portugal.

The presence of \n\nthese minerals, both in the core materials and as efflorescent salts on the amended wastes, means \n\nthat they are moderately soluble, since the solutions that rise to the surface by capillarity can generate \n\nthe same solid phases. However, the significant retention of trace elements in solid phases (Tables 4 \n\nand 5) and therefore the decrease of their concentration in leachates (Figs. 2 and 3) can be explained \n\nby the formation of these stable solid phases, under these experimental conditions. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 10 X-ray diffractograms of the minerals identified in amended mine waste materials, collected in two depths \n\n(A:&lt;5 cm; B: ?10 cm) after thirteen months of incubation. \n\n\n\nEffects of organic/inorganic amendments on trace elements dispersion by leachates from sulfide-containing tailings of the S\u00e3o Domingos mine, Portugal.

Time evaluation \n\n203 \n\n \n\nThe amount of trace elements leached in each sampling period is not enough to explain the sharp \n\ndecrease in elemental concentrations in the leachate samples collected in the thirteen month. \n\nAlthough iron oxides occur usually in mines after sulfide oxidation (Abreu et al., 2010; Rosado et \n\nal., 2008; S\u00e1nchez-Espa\u00f1a, 2008; S\u00e1nchez-Espa\u00f1a et al., 2005; Valente and Gomes, 2009), no iron \n\noxides were identified due to the low pH of the waste materials. The abovementioned identified solid \n\nphases, as for instance melanterite and jarosite, show that the iron was in the structure of those solids. \n\n \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n\n \n\nThe waste dumps containing sulfides displayed very low pH and a large capacity to leach chemical \n\nelements due to the continuous generation of acid mine drainage, and their large multielemental \n\nconcentrations.  \n\nThe amendments had very low pH buffer capacity in relation to the acid generated by the mine \n\nwastes. They were efficient in decreasing the elemental concentrations in leachates, compared to \n\ncontrol, but only for a short period. However, during the thirteen months, the leached fraction of As, Fe \n\nand S from the amended sulfide materials were significantly decreased when compared to the control. \n\nThe organic materials from the amendments improved the materials structure, increasing water \n\nretention and preventing excessive dryness with the appearance of local very high acidic conditions \n\n(pH &lt;1). \n\nLow concentrations of trace elements in leachates from all treatments after thirteen months could \n\nbe due to the presence, mainly in the core materials, of several solid phases with moderate solubility. \n\nMelanterite can be associated with copiapite-group minerals and also with alunite-jarosite-group \n\nminerals. Nevertheless, the higher solubility of the minerals of the copiapite-group than those of the \n\nalunite-jarosite-group means that the former solid phases crystallise from more concentrated solutions \n\nwith lower pH and lower water activity. For a pH lower than 1.5, it is very likely that rozenite is a more \n\nstable solid phase than melanterite, which contains more crystallisation water molecules. \n\nThe presence of copiapite-group minerals in the efflorescent salts of control samples indicates the \n\nexistence of more extreme conditions (pH &lt;1.5, high elemental concentrations and low water activity) \n\ncompared to the other situations (control core materials, and efflorescent salts and core materials in \n\namended wastes) where the alunite-jarosite-group minerals were identified. Despite the moderate \n\nsolubility of the alunite-jarosite-group minerals, their crystallisation, together with arsenbrackebuschite, \n\nberlinite and the apatite-group minerals hedyphane and mimetite-(OH), can be used to explain the \n\nsharp decrease in the concentrations of the studied trace elements in the leachates collected in the \n\nthirteen month of incubation. A deep analysis of the final values attained after this time, combined with \n\nthe leachates pH, illustrated that the crystallisation of these solid phases was not suitable for \n\nenvironmental remediation, due to the high elemental concentrations still present in the leachates. On \n\nthe other hand, the stability of jarosite in the pH range between ~ 1.5 and ~ 4.5 confirms the previous \n\nconclusion that this solid phase, as well as the majority of the minerals of the alunite-jarosite-group, \n\nare not suitable for chemical elements immobilization, as they will change to different solid phases \n\nwhen the pH increases.  \n\n\n\nEffects of organic/inorganic amendments on trace elements dispersion by leachates from sulfide-containing tailings of the S\u00e3o \nDomingos mine, Portugal. Time evaluation \n\n204 \n\n \n\nThe amendments improved, in general, the chemical characteristics of the mine wastes. The dose \n\nof the amendments did not influence leachates characteristics during the entire experiment. Other \n\norganic and inorganic wastes, as well as their rate of application, should be studied over a longer time \n\nspan in order to reduce AMD generation and chemical elements leaching and spread from sulfide \n\nmine wastes.  \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors would like thanks: Madre Fruta (Hubel Group) for providing the \n\nagriculture wastes and rockwool and Mr. Jos\u00e9 G.

CHEMICAL QUALITY OF LEACHATES AND \n\nENZIMATIC ACTIVITIES IN TECHNOSOLS WITH \n\nGOSSAN AND SULFIDE WASTES FROM THE S\u00c3O \n\nDOMINGOS MINE \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChemical quality of leachates and enzimatic activities in Technosols with gossan and sulfide wastes from the S\u00e3o Domingos \nmine \n\n209 \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\n \n\nS\u00e3o Domingos mine area (Portuguese Iberian Pyrite Belt) contains several mine wastes with different \n\nenvironmental hazard which are disposed irregularly over a large area. This study aimed to evaluate: \n\ni) soil enzymatic activities, chemical quality of leachates and Cistus ladanifer germination in \n\nTechnosols composed of gossan or sulfide wastes from the mine and amendment mixtures (organic \n\nand inorganic); ii) the efficiency of a layer of gossan over sulfide wastes to improve rehabilitation of the \n\nmore hazardous waste. \n\nTechnosols were composed of gossan or sulfide wastes and amendment mixtures, at 12 and 30 g/kg, \n\ncontaining organic/inorganic wastes from agriculture and distilleries in equal proportion. Three \n\nmicrocosm assays, under controlled conditions, were carried out: Gossan/sulfide wastes and \n\nrespective Technosols (assays 1-2); (assay 3) Sulfide wastes, with/without amendments, incubated \n\nduring four months and then with an application of a thin overlayer of gossan with/without the same \n\namendments. Cistus ladanifer was sown in half of the pots from each treatment while the remainder \n\nwas left bare. After three and nine months of incubation, composite samples of the materials were \n\ncollected and dehydrogenase, acid phosphatase and ?-glucosidase activities were determined. In \n\nsame sampling periods, percolation leachates were analysed for anions and cations concentrations, \n\npH and electrical conductivity.  \n\nTechnosols with gossan wastes were significantly different (p &lt;0.05) due to higher dehydrogenase \n\nand ?-glucosidase activities, better seedling growth and improved chemical characteristics of \n\nleachates. Although electrical conductivity and concentrations of some elements (e.g. As and SO4) in \n\nleachates from Technosols with sulfide wastes were reduced (>50 % of Electrical conductivity and 23\u2013\n\n99 % depending on element, Technosol and sampling period), the amendments did not prevent sulfide \n\noxidation and acid generation, improve enzymatic activities or allow seed germination. Higher \n\nelements concentrations in leachates were obtained with the overlapping of two Technosols or mine \n\nwastes, compared to the leachates from assays with a single mine waste. Application of a \n\ngossan/Technosol layer over sulfide wastes allowed C. ladanifer germination but plants died after ?50 \n\ndays. \n\nThe use of Technosols derived from gossan or sulfide wastes may be an efficient solution for \n\nrehabilitation of these mine wastes. However, the results with sulfide wastes were not encouraging. \n\nThe use of a Technosol obtained from gossan wastes seems be a promising approach to isolate \n\nsulfide wastes from air and initiate their revegetation, but this technology requires further \n\nimprovements, namely to prevent the ascension of salts by capillarity. \n\n \n\nKEYWORDS Cistus ladanifer germination \u2022 Multielementar contamination \u2022 Organic/inorganic wastes \u2022 \n\nVegetation support \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChemical quality of leachates and enzimatic activities in Technosols with gossan and sulfide wastes from the S\u00e3o Domingos \nmine \n\n210 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBaseado no artigo publicado: Erika S.

Each mine waste poses different risks associated to \n\nits chemical composition and total concentrations of hazardous elements (\u00c1lvarez-Valero et al., 2008). \n\nAlthough this evaluation is important, real environmental impacts of mine wastes are related to the \n\navailable fraction of the elements and mass/volume of the heaps (P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2008). This is \n\nbecause only elements in aqueous solution or in easily exchangeable positions in soils or wastes are \n\ndirectly available to soil organisms (Adriano, 2001). Taken into account the mobility of trace elements \n\nand the mass/volume of the heaps, gossan and brittle pyrite wastes represent the fourth and fifth, \n\nrespectively, most hazardous mine wastes in the S\u00e3o Domingos mine area (P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2008). \n\nTo speed up ecological rehabilitation of these wastes, a combined strategy using different organic \n\nand inorganic amendments and mine wastes can be used to create specific Technosols (Mac\u00edas, \n\n2004; Mac\u00edas et al., 2011). The mail goal of these Technosols should be to improve the characteristics \n\nof mine wastes: chemical (e.g. increase in nutrients and organic matter and reduction of acid drainage \n\nand availability of hazardous elements), physical (e.g. substrata structure) and biological (enhanced \n\nplant cover and activity of soil microorganisms to promote elements cycling processes). Moreover, the \n\ndevelopment of a plant cover, namely of Cistus ladanifer L., can stimulate ecosystem functions of \n\nTechnosols containing gossan wastes (Santos et al., 2014a).Cistus ladanifer is a pioneer species that \n\ngrows spontaneously in several mine areas in the Iberian Pyrite Belt due to it efficient mechanisms of \n\ntolerance (Alvarenga et al., 2004; Batista et al., 2007; Freitas et al., 2004; Santos et al., 2009, 2012, \n\n2013a, 2014b). \n\nIn general, soil quality depends on several physical, chemical, biological and biochemical \n\nproperties (Kumar et al., 2013). Soil enzyme activities are very sensitive with a fast response to \n\ninduced changes during degradation/contamination and ecological rehabilitation (Karlen et al., 1997; \n\nSantos et al., 2013b, 2014a; de Varennes et al., 2010a). Determination of different soil enzymatic \n\nactivities can also indicate potential variation in microbial diversity. However, few studies are available \n\non the dynamics of enzymatic activities in mine wastes or soils developed on mine wastes, \n\nwith/without amendments, for long periods of monitoring (Burgos et al., 2010; Santos et al., 2014a).  \n\nThis study aimed to evaluate: i) soil enzymatic activities, chemical quality of leachates and Cistus \n\nladanifer germination in Technosols composed of gossan or sulfide wastes from S\u00e3o Domigos mine \n\nand amendment mixtures (organic and inorganic); ii) the efficiency of a layer of gossan over sulfide \n\nwastes (with/without amendments) to improve rehabilitation of the more hazardous waste. We \n\nhypothesized that the conception of Technosols with amendments mixtures and mine wastes would \n\nincrease enzymatic activities related to biogeochemical cycles and improve the chemical quality of \n\nleachates in order to decrease the dispersion of elements and allow the development of pioneer \n\nvegetation. Moreover, the overlapping of Technosolos would isolate sulfide wastes from air/water what \n\nwould promote the plant cover and, consequently, reduce leaching of chemical elements. \n\n \n\n\n\nChemical quality of leachates and enzimatic activities in Technosols with gossan and sulfide wastes from the S\u00e3o Domingos \nmine \n\n212 \n\n \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n\nExperiment set-up \n\n \n\nComposite samples of two mining wastes, which are composed of gossan materials mixed with \n\nhost rocks (hereinafter named as gossan wastes ? GW) and crushed pyrite and smelting ashes \n\n(herein after named as sulfide wastes ? SW), and Cistus ladanifer seeds were collected in the S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos mine area in 2009. Sampling area for GW was located near the open pit and for SW was \n\nsouth-west of the open pit, near the former leaching tanks. These mine wastes were chosen due to \n\nthe large amounts of trace elements present and consequent potential environmental risks, wide \n\ndistribution in the mine area (\u00c1lvarez-Valero et al., 2008; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2008; Quental et al., \n\n2002) and level of plant colonization. The SW are bare and exposed to severe water erosion while \n\nGW are naturally colonized by autochthonous plants. The chemical characteristics of the mine wastes \n\nare given in Table 1. \n\nThe Technosols (Table 2) were composed of GW or SW and an amendment mixture containing \n\norganic/inorganic wastes (equal proportion of each residue) from agriculture (plant remains + \n\nstrawberry substrate at 2:3 m/m \u2013 AgW; and rockwool used for strawberry crops \u2013 RW) and residues \n\nfrom distilleries (Arbutus unedo L. and Ceratonia siliqua L. fruit spirits distillation \u2013 AW, CW, \n\nrespectively). Three amendment mixtures were tested (AgW + AW + RW; AgW + CW + RW; and AgW \n\n+ AW +CW + RW) at two application rates (12 and 30 g/kg of mine waste). Residues from a quarry \n\n(limestone rock wastes \u2013 LRW) were only added, at 22 g/kg, to SW to increase pH to similar values as \n\nthat of GW. These organic and inorganic wastes were used due to their physical and chemical \n\ncharacteristics (Table 1) and because they are easily available in the vicinity of the mine at a very low \n\ncost. \n\nThe mine wastes and amendments were air-dried, mixed manually and put in pots. Three \n\nmicrocosm assays were carried out: (Assay 1) GW (fraction &lt;10 mm) with/without amendments \n\n(seven treatments: one control and six Technosols) with three replicates each, 2 kg of GW per pot; \n\n(Assay 2) SW (total fraction) with/without amendments (seven treatments: one control and six \n\nTechnosols) with four replicates each, 2 kg of SW per pot; (Assay 3) Sulfide wastes, with/without \n\namendments, incubated during four months and then with application of an overlayer of gossan (?4 \n\ncm thick) with/without the same amendments (seven treatments: one control and six Technosols) with \n\nfour replicates each, 2 kg of GW and 4 kg of SW per pot. To evaluate the efficiency of the application \n\nof an overlayer of gossan, GW or SW with amendments (Technosols) were used as positive controls \n\nwhile GW or SW acted as negative controls.  \n\nCistus ladanifer was sown (0.5 g seeds per pot) in half of the pots from each treatment, while the \n\nother pots remained bare. The seeds were pre-treated for optimal germination (heating at 100 \u00b0C for \n\n30 min; Corral et al., 1990). All treatments were kept at 70 % of the maximum water-holding capacity \n\nunder controlled conditions in a greenhouse and monitored for nine months (July-April). \n\n\n\nChemical quality of leachates and enzimatic activities in Technosols with gossan and sulfide wastes from the S\u00e3o Domingos mine \n\n213 \n\n \n\nTable 1 Chemical characteristics of the gossan and the sulfide wastes from S\u00e3o Domingos mine area and organic/inorganic wastes used as amendments (min \u2013 max or mean \n\nvalue) (Santos et al. 2014a,b). \n\n GW SW AgW AW CW RW \n\npH (H2O) 4.32 2.1 \u2013 2.3 6.6 \u2013 7.2 4.9 6.1 7.1 \n\nElectrical conductivity (mS/cm)&lt;0.1 7.4 \u2013 7.5 0.9 \u2013 3.5 1.7 0.2 3.5 \n\nOrganic C (g/kg) 12.0 243.8 \u2013 276.1* 286.1 442.6 436.7 111.0 \n\nTotal N (g/kg) 0.04 3.7 \u2013 4.8 9.7 8.9 11.1 9.8 \n\nExtractable P (g/kg) 1.3 x 10\n-3\n\n &lt;DL 0.3 \u2013 3.1 0.2 0.1 7.9 \n\nExtractable K (g/kg) 0.08 0.02 \u2013 0.06 0.2 \u2013 6.6 3.6 9.1 0.7 \n\nTotal concentrations (g/kg dry weight) \n\nAl 24.8 54.8 \u2013 61.2 4.06 1.37 0.6 x 10\n-3\n\n 53.4 \n\nAs 3.03 1.02 \u2013 1.14 2.3 x 10\n-3\n\n 1.0 x 10\n-3\n\n 0.8 x 10\n-3\n\n &lt;0.5 x 10\n-3\n\n \n\nCa 0.5 6.40 \u2013 6.70 22.56 10.30 11.02 139.0 \n\nCu 0.23 1.84 \u2013 2.45 44.6 x 10\n-3\n\n 0.12 9.4 x 10\n-3\n\n 0.08 \n\nFe 129 104 \u2013 110 2.96 3.30 0.99 39.90 \n\nK 21.2 12.8 \u2013 14.3 1.495 > 1.32 0.96 6.80 \n\nMg 1.2 1.4 \u2013 1.8 2.34 1.13 > 9.63 42.10 \n\nMn 62.0 x 10\n-3\n\n 0.12 \u2013 0.16 0.25 51.2 x 10\n-3\n\n 43.1 x 10\n-3\n\n 1.85 \n\nNa 1.7 4.20 \u2013 4.60 0.31 0.40 0.40 13.10 \n\nPb 1.08 8.97 \u2013 13.80 5.0 x 10\n-3\n\n 3.1 x 10\n-3\n\n 0.9 x 10\n-3\n\n &lt;3 x 10\n-3\n\n \n\nS 9.21 63.6 \u2013 68.0 NA NA NA 2.60 \n\nZn 13.7 1.08 \u2013 1.19 75.6 x 10\n-3\n\n 27.3 x 10\n-3\n\n 18.5 x 10\n-3\n\n 0.20 \n\n*Total C concentration; GW: gossan wastes; SW: sulfide wastes; AgW: Agriculture wastes; AW: residue from the liquor distillation of A. unedo fruit; CW: residue from liquor distillation of C. siliqua \nfruit; RW: rockwool used for strawberry crops; DL: detection limit; NA: non analysed \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChemical quality of leachates and enzimatic activities in Technosols with gossan and sulfide wastes from the S\u00e3o Domingos mine \n\n214 \n\n \n\nTable 2 Composition of the Technosols used in the three assays. \n\nMine waste Amendment mixture \n\nRate of application \n\n(g/kg of mine waste) \n\n(designation) \n\nOther inorganic wastes \nRate of application \n\n(g/kg of mine waste) \n\nGossan wastes (GW) \n\nAssay 1 \n\nAgW + AW + RW 12 (GA12), 30 (GA30) --- --- \n\nAgW + CW + RW 12 (GC12); 30 (GC30) --- --- \n\nAgW + AW + CW + RW 12 (GAC12); 30 (GAC30) --- --- \n\nSulfide wastes (SW) \n\nAssay 2 \n\nAgW + AW + RW 12 (SA12), 30 (SA30) LRW 22 \n\nAgW + CW + RW 12 (SC12); 30 (SC30) LRW 22 \n\nAgW + AW + CW + RW 12 (SAC12); 30 (SAC30) LRW 22 \n\nGossan and sulfide wastes (GW/SW) \n\n(independent layers) \n\nAssay 3 \n\nAgW + AW + RW 12 ((G/S)A12), 30 ((G/S)A30) LRW only in SW 22 \n\nAgW + CW + RW 12 ((G/S)C12); 30 ((G/S)C30) LRW only in SW 22 \n\nAgW + AW + CW + RW 12 ((G/S)AC12); 30 ((G/S)AC30) LRW only in SW 22 \n\nAgW: agriculture wastes; AW: residue from the liquor distillation of A. unedo fruit; CW: residue from liquor distillation of C. siliqua fruit; RW: rockwool used for strawberry crops; LRW: limestone \nrock wastes \n\n \n\n\n\nChemical quality of leachates and enzimatic activities in Technosols with gossan and sulfide wastes from the S\u00e3o Domingos \nmine \n\n215 \n\n \n\nExperimental monitoring and sample analyses \n\n \n\nAt the beginning and after three and nine months (end of the experiment), composite samples of \n\nthe materials from each pot were collected (assays 1 and 2: &lt;3 cm of depth; assay 3: &lt;3 cm (gossan \n\nmaterials) and 5?7 cm of depth (sulfide materials). These materials were homogenised, sieved (&lt;2 \n\nmm) and kept fresh (4 \u00baC) until soil enzymatic analysis. \n\nThree enzymatic activities were analysed as biological parameters to evaluate the rehabilitation \n\nprocess: dehydrogenase (Tabatabai, 1994), ?-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21; Eivazi and Tabatabai, 1988) \n\nand acid phosphomonoesterase (acid phosphatase EC 3.1.3.2; Eivazi and Tabatabai, 1977). \n\nDehydrogenase was used as an indicator of overall microbial activity while other enzymatic activities \n\nare related to C and P cycling. \n\nIn the same sampling periods, percolation leachates were obtained by irrigation of the materials \n\n(without plants) with a volume of deionised water that ensured an excess of 10 % of each pot\u2019s \n\nmaximum water holding capacity, and left to percolate for 24 h. The leachates were vacuum filtrated (&lt;\n\n0.45 \u00b5m), and pH and electrical conductivity (EC) measured. The filtrate was kept at \u201318 \u00baC until \n\nanalysis. In the leachates, the concentrations of Al, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Pb and Zn were \n\nanalysed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry; As by graphite furnace atomic absorption \n\nspectrometry; chlorides, nitrates and sulfates by ion chromatography; and phosphates by visible \n\nspectrophotometry using the molybdenum blue method (USEPA, 1979).  \n\n \n\nData analysis \n\n \n\nData were analysed by one way ANOVA and the Duncan test (p &lt;0.05) used to separate means, \n\nusing the statistical programme SPSS v18.0 for Windows. Data not satisfying assumptions for ANOVA \n\nwere analysed non-parametrically using Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA by a rank test. For statistical \n\npurposes, the results below the detection limit were assumed as half of the detection limit. Bivariate \n\nPearson correlations were used to correlate leachates characteristics and soil enzymatic activities \n\n(strong correlation: r> 0.95; moderate correlation: 0.65 &lt;r &lt;0.95). Quality control of the analyses was \n\nmade by analytical replicate samples, use of certified standards solutions and laboratory standards at \n\nan international accredited laboratory (multielemental concentration of mine and organic/inorganic \n\nwastes).  \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nGossan wastes \n\n \n\nChemical characterization of leachates \n\n \n\nThe amendments increased pH of GW leachates by more than one unit (4.5\u20135.6, except for \n\nTechnosols containing A. unedo fruit spirit distillation (GA12 and GA30) and both fruits spirits \n\ndistillation and amendment mixture applied at 12 g/kg (GAC12) where pH was close to 4.5 in the first \n\n\n\nChemical quality of leachates and enzimatic activities in Technosols with gossan and sulfide wastes from the S\u00e3o Domingos \nmine \n\n216 \n\n \n\nsampling) compared to the control (3.6 &lt;GW &lt;4.0; Fig. 1), with no significant differences between the \n\nthree sampling dates.

Significant decreases \n\n(p &lt;0.05) in the concentrations of elements (except As) in leachates occurred in the two sampling \n\ndates. In leachates from contaminated sediments from S\u00e3o Domingos amended with sugar foam, \n\nashes from combustion of biomass and red gypsum, Rodr\u00edguez-Jord\u00e1 et al. (2012) also reported a \n\ntwo-phase time-dependent behaviour for the concentrations of Cu, Pb and Zn, with an initial decrease \n\n(until ?20 days) and then a steady state. For As, a progressive increase in the concentration occurred \n\nduring the experiment, independently of the treatment (Table 3). \n\nIn Technosols, especially those containing an amendment mixture at 12g/kg and containing A. \n\nunedo fruit spirit distillation (GA12) and different amendment mixtures at 30 g/kg (GA30, GC30 and \n\nGAC30), there was a significant increase in the concentrations of the elements in leachates (between \n\n1.5 and 11-fold depending on the element), compared to control (Table 3 and Fig. 2). However, no \n\nclear tendency was verified according to the type of amendment, element and sampling period. \n\nIncreases in the concentrations of As, Na and phosphate in simulated leachates was also reported in \n\nsoils developed on gossan wastes but amended with hydrophilic polyacrylate polymers (Santos et al., \n\n2013b).Depending on characteristics of amendments and mine wastes, the concentrations of \n\nelements in leachates can vary with time due to different chemical and mineralogical reactions. In \n\nTechnosols, the high concentrations of chlorides and nutrients were related to nutrient solution used in \n\nstrawberry cultivation, which was incorporated in rockwool (Table 1). This increase in nutrients can be \n\nconsidered an advantage for the phytostabilization process, namely with C. ladanifer, as reported by \n\nSantos et al. (2014a).  \n\nComparing the elements in control and Technosols, two groups of elements that constituted \n\nexceptions were observed: As and Fe, and Al, Cu, Pb and nitrates (Table 3 and Fig. 2). In the first \n\nsampling, similar concentrations of As and Fe among leachates were obtained, usually lower than 25 \n\n\u00b5g As/L and 0.62 mg Fe/L. However, at the beginning and at the end of the experiment, As \n\nconcentrations in leachates from Technosols with rate application of 30 g/kg and containing residue \n\nfrom liquor distillation of C. siliqua fruit (GC30: 1.40 and 76.6 \u00b5g As/L, respectively) and both residues \n\nfrom liquors distillation (GAC30: 7.59 and 51.8 \u00b5g As/L, respectively) were significantly higher than \n\ncontrol (0.73 and 9.3 \u00b5g As/L, respectively). The type of organic matter derived from residue of liquor \n\ndistillation of C. siliqua fruit and its content in these Technosols can play an important role in As \n\nmobility (Kumpiene et al., 2008). Moreover, the increase of low-molecular-weight organic acids \n\nfollowing amendment application can release As from Fe\u2013, Mn\u2013 and Al\u2013oxides or hydroxides in \n\ncontaminated soils (Zang et al., 2005). In fact, soils developed on mine wastes from S\u00e3o Domingos \n\nmine area can present a considerable fraction of As associated to Fe\u2013oxides and organic matter (6\u2013\n\n27 % and 1\u201334 % of total As concentrations, respectively) (Abreu et al., 2012; Santos et al., 2012). \n\nThe inhibition of the formation of metal arsenates, that naturally occur in gossan wastes (Santos et al., \n\n2012), may be another factor explaining the As increase in leachates.  \n\n\n\nChemical quality of leachates and enzimatic activities in Technosols with gossan and sulfide wastes from the S\u00e3o Domingos \nmine \n\n218 \n\n \n\na\n\na\n\na\n\nb\nb\n\nb\n\nc\n\nc c\nd\n\nc cd c c\n\nc\n\nc cd c c\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\nA\nl \n\nc\no\n\nn\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\n\nb\n\nb a\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\nc\n\nb\n\nbc\n\nb\n\nbc\n\nb\nbc\n\nb\n\nb\nc\n\nb\nb\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\nC\nu\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\n\nc\nc b\n\nb\n\na a\n\nab\n\nab a\n\nb\n\nbc\nab\n\na\n\nab\nab\n\nb\n\nabc\n\nab\n\nb\n\na a\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\nC\na\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\n\nGW GA12 GA30 GC12 GC30 GAC12 GAC30\n\na\n\na\n\nab\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\na c\n\na\n\na\nc\n\na\n\na\n\nabc\n\na\n\na\n\nabc\n\na\n\na\nc\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\nF\ne\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\ng\n\n/L\n)\n\nc\nb\n\nb\n\nbc\n\nb b\n\nb\n\na\nab\n\nb\n\nb b\n\na\n\na\n\nab\n\nbc\n\nb\nab\n\nb\n\na\na\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nK\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\n\ne\nb b\n\nb\n\nabc a\n\nb\n\na\n\na\n\nd\n\nc\nb\n\na\n\nab\n\nb\n\ncd\n\nc\nb\n\nbc\n\nab\na\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\nM\n\ng\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\n\nc b b\n\na\n\na a\nb\n\nb\nb\n\nbc\n\nb\nb\n\nb\n\nb\nb\n\nbc\n\nb\n\nab\nbc\n\nb\nb\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\nM\nn\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\n\nd c\nb\n\nb\n\nbc ab\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\nc\n\nc\nb\n\na\n\nb\n\nb\n\nc\n\nbc\n\nab\n\nbc\n\nb a\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nN\na\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\n\nb\n\nb\na\n\na\n\na\n\nbb c b\n\nb\n\nc b\n\nb\n\nc b\n\nb\n\nc b\n\nb\n\nc b\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n0 1\u00ba 2\u00ba\n\nP\nb\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\n\nSampling\n\nc\n\nb b\n\na\n\na\n\na\nab\n\nb\nbc b\n\nb\nbc\n\nb\n\nb\nbc\n\nb\nbbc\n\nb\nb\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n0 1\u00ba 2\u00ba\n\nZ\nn\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\n\nSampling  \n\nGW: gossan wastes; GA12 and GA30: Technosol containing GW and AgW+AW+RW at 12 and 30 g/kg; GC12 and GC30: Technosol containing \nGW and AgW+CW+RW at 12 and 30 g/kg; GAC12 and GAC30: Technosol containing GW and AgW+AW+CW+RW at 12 and 30 g/kg.

These reductions seem to be \n\nrelated to the increase of pH of leachates (-0.65 &lt;r &lt;-0.85). However, the application of organic \n\nmatter can also promote the formation of complexes with cations and increase cationic exchange \n\ncapacity (Adriano et al. 2004). According to Hodson et al. (2001), the immobilization of some metals \n\n(e.g. Pb) after addition of phosphate ions to contaminated soils can be related to the formation of \n\nmetal phosphates with low solubility. The same was also reported by Santos et al. (2014c) in another \n\ntype of mine wastes and using similar amendments. As the amendments used were a significant \n\nsource of phosphates, this fact could also occur in GW. Moreover, small availability of As, Pb and Fe \n\ncan be related to their presence in other solid phases presenting low solubility (Santos et al., 2012).   \n\n \n\nCistus ladanifer germination and enzymatic activities \n\n \n\nGermination and growth of C. ladanifer seedlings was stimulated in Technosols, compared to GW. \n\nTwo months after sowing, a great variability in plant height was observed but, in general, the \n\namendments provided nutrients which may explain the higher plant height. Thus, plants growing in \n\nTechnosols had a height of 2\u20134 cm while in control they only had 1\u20131.5 cm. Nevertheless, no visible \n\nsymptoms of deficiency or toxicity were observed in all seedlings. According to several authors (de \n\nVarennes et al., 2010a; Qu and de Varennes, 2010; Santos et al., 2014a), the improvement in the \n\nstructure and water-holding capacity of soils developed on gossan wastes or even gossan wastes, by \n\napplication of organic and inorganic wastes, are important factors that stimulate germination and \n\ngrowth of plants (e.g. C. ladanifer, Spercularia purpurea (Persoon) G. Don fil., Briza maxima L. and \n\nChaetopogon fasciculatus (Link) Hayek). Moreover, the improvement in the fertility of these materials \n\nleads to higher plant biomass accumulation (de Varennes et al., 2010a,b; Qu and de Varennes, 2010; \n\nSantos et al., 2014a). \n\nEnzymatic activities (Figs. 3 and 4) were used as biological indicators to assess the efficiency of \n\nthe Technosols containing GW. General activity of microorganisms, evaluated by dehydrogenase \n\nactivity, was stimulated in Technosols (1.66\u201320.20 \u00b5g TPF g\n-1\n\n 16h\n-1\n\n) compared to control (0.72\u20131.79 \n\n\u00b5g TPF g\n-1\n\n 16h\n-1\n\n) (Fig. 3). The same tendency was observed in the ?-glucosidase activity (\u00b5mol ?-\n\nnitrophenol g?\u00b9 h?\u00b9 \u2013 Technosols: 0.04\u20130.20, Control: 0.03\u20130.04; Fig. 5) but not in the acid \n\nphosphatase activity (\u00b5mol ?-nitrophenol g?\u00b9 h?\u00b9 \u2013Techonosols: 0.51\u20130.83, Control: 0.64\u20130.76; Fig. 4). \n\nThe influence of organic matter on soil biological properties can vary with content, type, and dominant \n\ncomponent of added organic materials (Tejada et al., 2006). However, in this assay, specially \n\nTechnosols receiving a high dose of amendment mixture had higher (p &lt;0.05) dehydrogenase and ?-\n\nglucosidase activities during the experiment (3.45\u201320.20 \u00b5g TPF g\n-1\n\n 16h\n-1\n\n and 0.13\u20130.20 \u00b5mol ?-\n\nnitrophenol g?\u00b9 h?\u00b9, depending on Technosol and sampling date) than the control (Figs. 3 and 4). \n\nAccording to Santos et al. (2014a) and de Varennes et al. (2010b), the significant increase of organic \n\nC by the application of high doses of amendment mixtures in GW or soils developed on gossan \n\n\n\nChemical quality of leachates and enzimatic activities in Technosols with gossan and sulfide wastes from the S\u00e3o Domingos \nmine \n\n221 \n\n \n\nwastes has a positive effect on dehydrogenase and ?-glucosidase activities. This stimulation was also \n\nreported for acid phosphatase activity in soils developed on gossan (de Varennes et al., 2010b) in \n\ncontrast to the results obtained in this study. Stimulation of dehydrogenase and ?-glucosidase \n\nactivities was also verified with addition of several organic and inorganic amendments to contaminated \n\nsoils from other mine areas (Burgos et al., 2010; P\u00e9rez de Mora et al., 2005). \n\nAlthough some authors (Burgos et al., 2010; Santos et al., 2014a) reported a correlation between \n\npH of materials and enzymatic activities, no correlations were observed between pH or the \n\nconcentration of elements in leachates and enzymatic activities in the present experiment.  \n\nThe dehydrogenase activities of GW, GA12, GC30, GAC12 and GAC30 had an initial increase and \n\nthen a decrease. Although in other treatments the same tendency was observed, the variations were \n\nnot statistically significant due to the variability of the results. This suggests that amendments had a \n\nshort lived impact on soil microorganisms. \n\n \n\nGW: gossan wastes; SW: sulfide wastes; GW/SW: gossan waste layer over sulfide waste; GA12, GA30, SA12 and SA30: Technosol containing \nGW or SW and AgW+AW+RW at 12 and 30 g/kg; GC12, GC30, SC12 and SC30: Technosol containing GW or SW and AgW+CW+RW at 12 and \n30 g/kg; GAC12, GAC30, SAC12 and SAC30: Technosol containing GW or SW and AgW+AW+CW+RW at 12 and 30 g/kg; (G/S)A12 and \n(G/S)A30: Overlapping of Technosols containing GW or SW and AgW+AW+RW at 12 and 30 g/kg; (G/S)C12 and (G/S)C30: Overlapping of \nTechnosols containing GW or SW and AgW+CW+RW at 12 and 30 g/kg; (G/S)AC12 and (G/S)AC30: Overlapping of Technosols containing GW \nor SW and AgW+AW+CW+RW at 12 and 30 g/kg.

Values from same assay and sampling period followed by a different letter are \n\nsignificantly different (p &lt;0.05). \n\n\n\nChemical quality of leachates and enzimatic activities in Technosols with gossan and sulfide wastes from the S\u00e3o Domingos \nmine \n\n223 \n\n \n\nSulfide wastes \n\nChemical characterization of leachates \n\n \n\nAs expected, leachates from SW were more acidic (pH: 1.1\u20131.6; Fig. 1) and had higher (p &lt;0.05) \n\nelectrical conductivity (more than 25-fold, 11.1\u201353.6 mS/cm; Fig. 1) and concentrations of elements \n\n(Table 4 and Fig. 5) than GW (Table 3 and Fig. 2). This fact is related to the high amount of sulfide \n\nminerals included in SW that contribute to the continuous formation of acid leachates and consequent \n\nrelease of chemical elements. Although different values of pH and electrical conductivity were \n\nobtained in the leachates from pyritic sludge (P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2007a,b; pH ? 2; EC: 2.5\u20134 mS/cm), \n\nin general, the concentration of chemical elements in SW leachates were in the same range as those \n\nreported for acid mine drainage in the IPB (Abreu et al., 2010; de la Torre et al., 2011; Ferreira da \n\nSilva et al., 2009; Sanchez-Espa\u00f1a et al., 2005, 2008). \n\nThe amendments increased significantly the pH of leachates (2.0\u20132.4), although these continued \n\nacidic, and reduced EC between 57 and 71 % compared to control (SW: 11.1\u201353.6 mS/cm) (Fig. 1). \n\nDuring the initial incubation (four months), the acidic nature of SW and the fine grain of the limestone \n\nrock wastes should promote a rapid dissolution of carbonates, but the other organic and inorganic \n\nwastes used had small buffering capacity so their application did not neutralize the leachates. \n\nA slight increase in the pH of leachates (up to pH of 2.9) and reduction of electrical conductivity \n\n(more than 50 %) was also observed with the application of different doses of pig manure to acidic \n\nmine soils during 21 weeks (Garc\u00e9s et al., 2008). However, mixture of fly ashes (waste with very high \n\nacid buffering capacity) with pyritic sludge mine was more effective in the improvement of pH and \n\nelectrical conductivity of leachates between 4 and 7 months of incubation (pH from 2 to ?7.5; EC from \n\n2.5\u20134 to ?0.5 mS/cm; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2007a,b). Nonetheless, Herbert and H\u00f6ckert (2009) also \n\nreported an increase of pH in leachates from waste rock from the Ljusnarsberg mine, which is \n\ncomposed of different sulfides, amended with paper mill sludge and activated sewage sludge between \n\n120 and 400 days (from ?3.5 to 6\u20137). \n\nIn general, concentrations of elements in leachates from all treatments were high at the beginning \n\nof the experiment and decreased over time (Table 4 and Fig. 5), with the same tendency as electrical \n\nconductivity. A similar behaviour was observed in leachates from pyritic sludge collected in S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos and waste rock from the Ljusnarsberg mine amended or not with different wastes (Herbert \n\nand H\u00f6ckert, 2009; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2007a,b). The intense formation of surface salts, namely \n\nmetal-sulfates and Ca-phosphates, can explain the decrease in the concentrations of dissolved ions \n\nduring the experiment (Santos et al., 2014c). Concentrations of K and Na from Technosols remained \n\nlow during the experiment (Fig. 5) while leachates from control and Technosols with application rate at \n\n12 and 30 g/kg and containing residue from the liquor distillation of A. unedo fruit (SA12 and SA30) \n\ncollected in the first sampling date had a significant increase of phosphate (more than 10-fold; Table \n\n4) compared to the beginning of the experiment.  \n\nIn the beginning of the experiment Technosols, independently of application dose and type of \n\namendments, leached lower amounts of elements (except Mg and phosphate) than control (Table 4 \n\nand Fig. 5). However, this trend was not maintained for all chemical elements. Thus, during the \n\n\n\nChemical quality of leachates and enzimatic activities in Technosols with gossan and sulfide wastes from the S\u00e3o Domingos \nmine \n\n224 \n\n \n\nexperiment, in leachates from all Technosols the concentrations of K, Na and Pb were reduced \n\nsignificantly by more than 85 % and that of sulfates at the end of experiment by 23\u201348 %, compared to \n\ncontrol (1.4\u20131.8 mg K/L, 7.6\u201320.7 mg Na/L, 2.0\u20132.3 mg Pb/L, 5.9 g SO4/L). Moreover, high application \n\nrates of amendment mixtures still led to a significant reduction of As (31\u201383 % depending on sampling \n\nperiod) and Fe (50\u201362 % at the end of the experiment) compared to control (9.3\u201314.5 mg As/L and 1.0 \n\ng Fe/L). The increase of cation exchange capacity, due to organic matter, can lead to the reduction of \n\nPb, K and Na in solution. However, Garc\u00e9s et al. (2008) reported a negative correlation between Pb \n\nconcentration and dissolved organic carbon in leachates after application of pig manure to acidic mine \n\nsoils. The decrease in the concentrations of elements can be also explained by the crystallisation of \n\nsolid phases from alunite\u2013jarosite-group and apatite\u2013group as well as arsenbrackebuschite \n\n(Pb2Fe\n3+\n\n(AsO4)2(OH)) (Santos et al., 2014c). \n\nSeveral authors (Herbert and H\u00f6ckert, 2009; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2007a,b; Sneddon et al., 2006) \n\nreported the reduction of the concentrations of several elements in leachates (e.g. As, Cu, Fe, Pb, Mn \n\nand Zn) following amendment application. However, Herbert and H\u00f6ckert (2009) and P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et \n\nal. (2007b) referred that the application of some amendments (e.g. sewage sludge, fly ashes or paper \n\nmill waste + biosludge) to wastes containing sulfides did not lead to the immobilisation of some \n\nelements (e.g. Ca, K and Na) in leachates. \n\nTechnosols, independently of application dose and amendment type, leached higher (p &lt;0.05) \n\namounts of Ca, Cu, Mg, Mn, Zn and phosphate (310\u2013709 mg Ca/L, 56.9\u2013265.4 mg Cu/L, 26.1\u2013219.5 \n\nmg Mg/L, 3.2\u201326.6 mg Mn/L,36.0\u2013223.3 mg Zn/L and 16.3\u2013253.4 mg PO4/L) than control (197.9\u2013\n\n277.5 mg Ca/L, 40.3\u201392.6 mg Cu/L,9.4\u201320.3 mg Mg/L, 1.4\u20135.4 mg Mn/L, 21.1\u201362.9 mg Zn/L and 9.0\u2013\n\n17.8 mg PO4/L) in both sampling periods (Fig. 5). Concentrations of Al from the Technosols with high \n\napplication rate of amendment mixture increased more than 2-fold being significantly different from the \n\ncontrol (01\u20130.2 g Al/L). However, the coexistence of several elements in high concentrations can \n\ndecrease the stabilization efficiency of the other elements due to, for example, competition for sorption \n\nsites (Kumpiene et al., 2008). The increase of Zn in leachates from Technosols can be related to an \n\nincrease of dissolved organic carbon (Garc\u00e9s et al., 2008) while the phosphates were linked to the \n\norganic matter and nutrient solution incorporated in the rockwool, which was used for strawberry \n\ncultivation. Nonetheless, the acidic conditions and the weathering of rockwool, which had significant \n\nconcentrations of Al, may explain the increase of this element in leachates. \n\nAn increase of the amendments dose in sulfide wastes can modify significantly leachate \n\ncharacteristics but were not enough to prevent acid mine drainage. In conclusion, all leachates had \n\nlarge amounts of hazardous chemical elements representing a great environmental risk. \n\n \n\n\n\nChemical quality of leachates and enzimatic activities in Technosols with gossan and sulfide wastes from the S\u00e3o Domingos \nmine \n\n225 \n\n \n\na\n\nc c\n\nbc\n\nbc\n\nbc\n\nab\n\nab\n\nab\n\nbc\n\nbc\nbc\n\nbc\n\na\n\na\n\nc\n\nbc\n\nbc\n\nab\n\nbc\n\nbc\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n4.5\n\nA\nl \n\nc\no\n\nn\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\ng\n\n/L\n)\n\na\n\nc\nc\n\nb\n\nab\n\nab\n\nb\n\nab\n\na\n\nbc\n\nab\n\nab\n\nbc a\n\na\n\nc\nb\n\nab\n\nab\nbc\n\nbc\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\nC\nu\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\na\n\nc b\n\nb\na\n\na\n\nb a\n\na\n\nb\na\n\na\n\nb\nb\n\na\n\nb\nb\n\na\n\nb\nab\n\na\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\nC\na\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\n\nSW SA12 SA30 SC12 SC30 SAC12 SAC30\n\na\n\na\na\n\na\n\nb\n\nab\na\n\nb\n\nb\na\n\nb\n\nb\na\n\nb\n\nb\n\na\n\nb\n\nab\n\na\nb\n\nb\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nF\ne\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\ng\n\n/L\n)\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nab\n\nb b\nb\n\nb\nb\n\nb\nb b\n\nb b\n\nb\n\nb b b\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\nK\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\n\nb\n\ne d\n\nb\n\ncd\n\nc\n\na\n\nab\n\nb\n\nbc\n\ncd\n\nc\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\nc\n\nd\n\nc\n\nbc\n\nbc\n\nbc\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\nM\n\ng\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\n\na\n\ne\nc\n\nbc\n\ncd\n\nb\n\nab\n\nab\n\na\n\nbcd\n\ncd\n\nb\n\nbcd\n\na\n\na\n\ncd\n\nd\n\nb\n\nbc\n\ncd\n\nb\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nM\nn\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\nb b\nb\n\nb b\nb\n\nb b\nb\n\nb b\nb\n\nb b\nb\n\nb b\nb\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nN\na\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\n\na\n\na\na\n\nb\n\nb b\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\nb\n\nb\nb\n\nb\n\nb\nb\n\nb\n\nb\nb\n\nb\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n4.5\n\n0 1\u00ba 2\u00ba\n\nP\nb\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\n\nSampling\n\nb\n\nc\nc\n\nb\n\nb\n\nbc\n\nb\n\nab\n\nab\n\nb\n\nb\nb\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n1400\n\n1600\n\n0 1\u00ba 2\u00ba\n\nZ\nn\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\n\nSampling  \n\nSW: sulfide wastes (control);

In \n\nfact, less acidic conditions in contaminated soils can explain higher enzymatic activities, namely \n\ndehydrogenase (Burgos et al., 2010). \n\nIn the beginning of the experiment, amendments in some Technosols (SC30, SAC12 and SAC30) \n\nsignificantly stimulated dehydrogenase (1.14, 1.35 and 1.80 \u00b5g TPF g\n-1\n\n 16h\n-1\n\n, respectively), compared \n\nto control where the activity was below the detection limit of the methodology (Fig. 3). Organic C \n\nderived from amendments may be responsible for the enhanced dehydrogenase activity in Technosols \n\nalthough dehydrogenase activity of control increased over time to similar values than that of \n\nTechnosols (except SA12 in the 2nd sampling where dehydrogenase activity was lower than control). \n\nVariations of leachates characteristics did not correlate to dehydrogenase activity. \n\nAccording to Hinojosa et al. (2008), toxicity of the pyrite sludge on dehydrogenase, acid \n\nphosphatase and ?-glucosidase can be reduced by application of sugar-beet residues. However, no \n\nsignificant variations in acid phosphatase and ?-glucosidase activities were detected with amendment \n\napplication in this experiment (Fig. 4). \n\n \n\nSulfide wastes with a layer of gossan wastes \n\nChemical characterization of leachates \n\n \n\nAccording to P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al. (2007a,b), the main concern of sulfide wastes is related to acid \n\nmine drainage generation. In this assay, an attempt was made to isolate SW from air/water using a \n\nlayer of GW which could support a pioneer vegetation which would reduce chemical elements \n\nleaching, promote microbial activity, ecological succession and soil formation.  \n\nAlthough leachates were still acidic and with high electrical conductivity, they had an electrical \n\nconductivity 36\u201360 % smaller and pH values increased more than 0.5 units, compared to control \n\n(GW/SW; 1.2&lt;pH&lt;1.6 and 12.0\u201331.6 mS/cm; Fig. 1). Although application of gossan layer over SW \n\nseemed to reduce the EC of leachates, this fact also occurred in SW leachates, associated with a \n\ndecrease of elements in solution over time. In general, application of a gossan layer over SW did not \n\nhave the same effect than the superficial application of fly ashes where pH reached values ?8.5 and \n\nEC was 0.5 mS/cm (P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2007a,b).  \n\nLeachates showed a reduction trend on the concentration of chemical elements (except for As and \n\nCa) with time (Table 4 and Fig. 6). This reduction does not agree with the results obtained in leachates \n\nfrom SW covered by a superficial layer of fly ashes, where the elements concentrations were constant \n\nafter four months of incubation (P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2007b). \n\n\n\nChemical quality of leachates and enzimatic activities in Technosols with gossan and sulfide wastes from the S\u00e3o Domingos \nmine \n\n228 \n\n \n\na\n\nc c\n\nbc\n\nbc\n\nbc\n\nab\n\nab\n\nab\n\nbc\n\nbc\nbc\n\nbc\n\na\n\na\n\nc\n\nbc\n\nbc\n\nab\n\nbc\n\nbc\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n4.5\n\nA\nl \n\nc\no\n\nn\nc\n\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n (\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\n\na\n\nc\nc\n\nb\n\nab\n\nab\n\nb\n\nab\n\na\n\nbc\n\nab\n\nab\n\nbc a\n\na\n\nc\nb\n\nab\n\nab\nbc\n\nbc\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\nC\nu\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\n\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n (\n\nm\ng\n\n/L\n)\n\na\n\nc b\n\nb\na\n\na\n\nb a\n\na\n\nb\na\n\na\n\nb\nb\n\na\n\nb\nb\n\na\n\nb\nab\n\na\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\nC\na\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\n\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n (\n\nm\ng\n\n/L\n)\n\nSW SA12 SA30 SC12 SC30 SAC12 SAC30\n\na\n\na\na\n\na\n\nb\n\nab\na\n\nb\n\nb\na\n\nb\n\nb\na\n\nb\n\nb\n\na\n\nb\n\nab\n\na\nb\n\nb\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nF\ne\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\n\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n (\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nab\n\nb b\nb\n\nb\nb\n\nb\nb b\n\nb b\n\nb\n\nb b b\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\nK\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\n\nb\n\ne d\n\nb\n\ncd\n\nc\n\na\n\nab\n\nb\n\nbc\n\ncd\n\nc\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\nc\n\nd\n\nc\n\nbc\n\nbc\n\nbc\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\nM\n\ng\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\n\na\n\ne\nc\n\nbc\n\ncd\n\nb\n\nab\n\nab\n\na\n\nbcd\n\ncd\n\nb\n\nbcd\n\na\n\na\n\ncd\n\nd\n\nb\n\nbc\n\ncd\n\nb\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nM\nn\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\n\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n (\n\nm\ng\n\n/L\n)\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\nb b\nb\n\nb b\nb\n\nb b\nb\n\nb b\nb\n\nb b\nb\n\nb b\nb\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nN\na\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\n\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n (\n\nm\ng\n\n/L\n)\n\na\n\na\na\n\nb\n\nb b\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\nb\n\nb\nb\n\nb\n\nb\nb\n\nb\n\nb\nb\n\nb\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n4.5\n\n0 1\u00ba 2\u00ba\n\nP\nb\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\n\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n (\n\nm\ng\n\n/L\n)\n\nSampling\n\nb\n\nc\nc\n\nb\n\nb\n\nbc\n\nb\n\nab\n\nab\n\nb\n\nb\nb\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n1400\n\n1600\n\n0 1\u00ba 2\u00ba\n\nZ\nn\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\n\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n (\n\nm\ng\n\n/L\n)\n\nSampling  \n\nSW: sulfide wastes (control); SA12 and SA30: Technosol containing SW and AgW+AW+RW at 12 and 30 g/kg; SC12 and \nSC30: Technosol containing SW and AgW+CW+RW at 12 and 30 g/kg; SAC12 and SAC30: Technosol containing SW and \nAgW+AW+CW+RW at 12 and 30 g/kg.

After that, significant differences were \n\nonly obtained with high application doses ((G/S)A30, (G/S)C30, (G/S)AC30: ?1 mg Mn/L). These \n\ndifferences were also observed for Al (2\nnd\n\n sampling) where the leachates reached the highest \n\nconcentrations (?0.5 g Al/L). For Cu, Na and phosphate (in both or in one sampling) leachates from \n\nsome Technosols reached higher concentrations than in control but with no clear tendency. \n\nA reduction of more than 32 % was observed for As, Fe, K, Na and Pb in leachates, in both \n\nsampling periods, as well as sulfates at the end of the experiment (Table 4 and Fig. 6). Concentrations \n\nof As, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, Zn and sulfates in leachates also decreased with application of fly ashes over \n\npyritic sludge (P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2007b). \n\nAlthough initially leachates went through the GW layer with a higher pH than the layer below, this \n\ndid not neutralize the acidity (similar pH values than leachates from assay 2) or reduce the mobility of \n\nelements in SW. This fact may be related to the small thickness of the GW layer (?4 cm) and \n\neluviation of small particles of gossan materials and/or amendments to sulfide wastes. According to \n\nSantos et al. (2014c), the maintenance of humid SW (70 % of the maximum water-holding capacity) \n\ngenerates very acidic aqueous solutions (also observed in the present experiment \u2013 Fig. 1) containing \n\nseveral chemical elements, which then ascend to the surface by capillarity during the warm/hot \n\nmonths and crystallise due to water evaporation. The formation of small efflorescent soluble salts on \n\nthe surface materials of this experiment confirms the occurrence of this process. The dissolution of \n\nthese solid phases could also be observed in leachates as the concentration of elements and EC \n\n(Table 4 and Figs. 1 and 6) were significantly higher than those obtained in SW (Table 4 and Fig. 5).  \n\nTherefore, the overlapping of two Technosols or of two mine wastes (GW and SW) in the \n\nconditions tested was not sufficient to improve leachates from sulfide wastes. \n\n \n\nCistus ladanifer germination and enzymatic activities \n\n \n\nCistus ladanifer germination occurred only in Technosols. This fact does not agree with the results \n\nobtained with GW. The combined effect of a weak structure of gossan wastes and the acid solution \n\nflowing upwards by capillarity from SW may explain the total inhibition of seed germination in control. \n\nApproximately 50 days after sowing, plants had a height of 2\u20133 cm in Technosols with no visible \n\nsymptoms of nutritional deficiency or phytotoxicity. However, after one week, all the seedlings died, \n\ncoinciding with the emergence of small quantities of salt efflorescences on the surface. As Technosols \n\nseem to support the vegetation, a thicker layer of Technosols made with gossan materials and organic \n\namendments may result in the rehabilitation of SW. \n\nEnzymatic activities were determined in both materials (GW with/without amendments in the \n\nsuperficial layer, and SW with/without amendments in the deeper layer). In GW no differences were \n\nobtained among dehydrogenase activities of different treatments collected at both sampling periods \n\n(0.41\u20131.17 \u00b5g TPF g 16h\n-1\n\n depending on treatment and sampling), as well as ?-glucosidase activity in\n\n\n\nChemical quality of leachates and enzimatic activities in Technosols with gossan and sulfide wastes from the S\u00e3o Domingos \nmine \n\n230 \n\n \n\nab\n\nc\n\nab\n\nbc\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\nc\n\nab\n\nab\n\nab\n\nc\n\nab\n\nab\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\nA\nl \n\nc\no\n\nn\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\ng\n\n/L\n)\n\nGW/SW (G/S)A12 (G/S)A30 (G/S)C12\n\n(G/S)C30 (G/S)AC12 (G/S)AC30\n\nb\n\nb\n\nab\n\nab\n\nab\n\na\n\nab\n\nab\n\nb\n\nab\n\na\n\nb\n\nab\n\nb\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\nC\nu\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\nC\na\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\n\na\n\na\n\nb\n\nab\nc\n\ncd\n\nb\n\nbc\nd\n\nd\n\nb\n\ncdd\ncd\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nF\ne\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\ng\n\n/L\n)\n\nab a\n\nb\nb\n\nb\nab\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\nab\n\nb\nab\n\na\n\nab\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\nK\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\n\nc\n\nc\n\nb\n\nb\n\na\n\na\n\nb\n\nb\n\na\n\nab\n\nb\n\na\n\na\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\nM\n\ng\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\n\nc\n\nc\n\nab\n\nabc\n\na\n\nba\n\nab\n\nbc\n\na\n\nba\n\na\n\nc\n\na\n\na\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nM\nn\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\n\nb\n\na\n\nd b\n\nc\n\nbd b\n\na\n\na\n\nd b\n\nbc\n\nb\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nN\na\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\n\na\n\na\n\nab\n\nb\n\na\n\nb\n\nab\n\nb\n\nc\n\nb\n\nab\n\nb\n\nbc\n\nb\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n1\u00ba 2\u00ba\n\nP\nb\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\n\nSampling\n\nc\n\na\n\nab\n\na\n\nab\n\na\n\nab\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\nab\n\na\n\nab\n\na\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n1\u00ba 2\u00ba\n\nZ\nn\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\n\nSampling  \n\n(GW/SW): gossan wastes layer over sulfide wastes (control); (G/S)A12 and (G/S)A30: Overlapping of Technosols containing GW or SW and \nAgW+AW+RW at 12 and 30 g/kg; (G/S)C12 and (G/S)C30: Overlapping of Technosols containing GW or SW and AgW+CW+RW at 12 and 30 \ng/kg; (G/S)AC12 and (G/S)AC30: Overlapping of Technosols containing GW or SW and AgW+AW+CW+RW at 12 and 30 g/kg.

GW/SW: 0.23 and 0.11 for acid \n\nphosphatase activities, 0.05 for ?-glucosidase activity) (Fig. 4). As expected, chemical characteristics \n\nof leachates were not related to the enzymatic activities of the gossan materials. In fact, the pH and \n\nelements concentrations are the result of leaching through gossan and sulfide wastes or Technosols \n\ncontaining both mine wastes.  \n\nIn all the treatments, no significant variations were obtained in dehydrogenase activity from gossan \n\nmaterials over time (Fig. 3). A similar tendency was observed for acid phosphatase, except in control \n\n(GW/SW) and Technosols containing residue from the liquor distillation of A. unedo fruit ((G/S)A12 \n\nand (G/S)A30), where acid phosphatase activity decreased (p &lt;0.05) during the experiment (Fig. 4). \n\nIn contrast, ?-glucosidase activities tended to increase in the first sampling (although only values from \n\ncontrol, (G/S)A12 and (G/S)AC12 were significant) but remained constant afterwards (Fig. 4).  \n\nDehydrogenase activities of gossan materials from all treatments were significantly smaller than \n\nthose from the first assay; however, for other enzymatic activities the same behaviour only occurred in \n\nsome treatments (acid phosphatase activity: GW/SW, (G/S)A12 and (G/S)A30; ?-glucosidase activity: \n\n(G/S)C30 and (G/S)AC12). Acidic conditions and high concentrations of elements that ascend from \n\nSW can justify the reduction of the enzymatic activities. According to Hinojosa et al. (2008), pyrite \n\nsludge mixed with soil can affect soil enzymes through various pathways: activity of the produced \n\nenzyme, biosynthesis of microbial enzymes, and composition of soil microflora or microbial groups \n\nthat produce extracellular enzymes. \n\nSome amendment mixtures seemed to have an impact on enzymatic activities in sulfide materials; \n\nhowever, no clear tendency between dose and amendment type was observed. Thus in the 1st \n\nsampling, sulfide materials from some Technosols ((G/S)/A12, ((G/S)/C12, ((G/S)/C30 and \n\n((G/S)/AC30) had lower (p &lt;0.05) dehydrogenase activities (<0.54 \u00b5g TPF g\n-1\n\n 16h\n-1\n\n) than control \n\n(1.38 \u00b5g TPF g\n-1\n\n 16h\n-1\n\n) while in the 2nd sampling the same happened in(G/S)/A12 and G/S)/C30 (\u00b5g \n\nTPF g\n-1\n\n 16h\n-1\n\n \u2013 ?0.2; GW/SW: 0.87). In contrast, in the 2nd sampling, acid phosphatase and ?-\n\nglucosidase activities of (G/S)/A30 (0.47 and 0.36 \u00b5mol ?-nitrophenol g?\u00b9 h?\u00b9, respectively) and acid \n\nphosphatase activity of (G/S)/AC30 (0.35 \u00b5mol ?-nitrophenol g?\u00b9 h?\u00b9) were significantly higher than in \n\ncontrol (\u00b5mol ?-nitrophenol g?\u00b9 h?\u00b9 \u2013 0.23 and 0.14 for acid phosphatase and ?-glucosidase activities, \n\nrespectively). \n\nIn general, enzymatic activities were constant over time, independently of treatment. Although acid \n\nphosphatase activities of control, (G/S)/A30 and (G/S)/C12 increased between the first and second \n\nsampling periods, no correlation was established with chemical characteristics of leachates. \n\nTherefore, microbial functions of SW and Technosols containing SW did not change with the \n\napplication of a superficial gossan layer with or without amendments. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChemical quality of leachates and enzimatic activities in Technosols with gossan and sulfide wastes from the S\u00e3o Domingos \nmine \n\n232 \n\n \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n\n \n\nLeachates from gossan wastes had low concentrations of elements and pH values around 3.5\u20134. \n\nIn general, amendments of these wastes improved significantly the chemical characteristics of \n\nleachates and the biological activity of the materials and stimulated germination and plant growth. \n\nThese facts are essential for the processes of natural attenuation or phytostabilization.  \n\nChemical characteristics of leachates from sulfide wastes were typical of acid mine drainage, with \n\nvery acidic pH (?1) and high concentrations of anions and cations. Although electrical conductivity and \n\nelements (As, Fe, K, Na, Pb and SO4) concentrations were reduced significantly and pH in leachates \n\nimproved, amendments application was not enough to reduce sulfides oxidation or buffer leachates \n\nacidity. Dehydrogenase activity was also only stimulated in the beginning of the experiment while no \n\nalterations occurred in other enzymatic activities, suggesting that this amendment application is not an \n\nappropriate solution to remediate sulfide wastes. \n\nDue to the great reactivity of sulfide wastes, their isolation from atmosphere may be the best \n\nsolution for rehabilitation. Although the application of a thin superficial layer of gossan with or without \n\namendments was not effective in the immobilization of chemical elements, some amendment mixtures \n\nseemed to have a positive effect on enzymatic activities and led to seed germination and seedling \n\ngrowth (although only during a short period), suggesting that a thicker layer of amended gossan \n\nmaterials may improve this system allowing plant establishment and, consequently, reducing chemical \n\nelements leaching from sulfide wastes.  \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors would like to thank Madre Fruta (Hubel Group) for providing \n\nthe agriculture wastes and rockwool and Mr. Jos\u00e9 G.

IMPROVEMENT OF CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL \n\nPROPERTIES OF GOSSAN MINE WASTES \n\nFOLLOWING APPLICATION OF AMENDMENTS AND \n\nGROWTH OF CISTUS LADANIFER L. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nImprovement of chemical and biological properties of gossan mine wastes following application of amendments and growth of \nCistus ladanifer L. \n\n239 \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\n \n\nGossan wastes represent one of the most hazardous mine wastes in several mining areas from the \n\nIberian Pyrite Belt. Phytostabilization of mine wastes with Cistus ladanifer L. could be a good option, \n\nbut its growth and germination are impaired by substrata conditions. To overcome these limitations, \n\napplication of organic and inorganic amendments may speed up the growth of C. ladanifer while \n\nimproving the mine wastes. This study evaluated the simultaneous influence of different application \n\nrates of amendments and growth of C. ladanifer on chemical and biological properties of gossan \n\nwastes.  \n\nAmendments used were mixtures (30, 75, 150 Mg/ha, 1:1:1) of rockwool, agriculture wastes and \n\nwastes from liquor distillation of Arbutus unedo L. fruits. A microcosm assay with four treatments was \n\ncarried out (control and three amended treatments) under controlled conditions in a greenhouse \n\nduring 505 days. C. ladanifer was sown in half of the pots from each treatment while the remainder \n\nwas left bare.  \n\nGossan wastes had large total concentrations of several elements (g/kg ? Al: 24.8, As: 3.03, Cu: 0.23, \n\nPb; 9.21) whereas the available concentrations of these elements were small (&lt;5.7 % of total). The \n\namendments applied (in particular at 75 and 150 Mg/ha) improved the structure and increased the \n\nwater-holding capacity, pH and nutrients concentrations in the available fraction of the gossan \n\nmaterials. They also led to increases in dehydrogenase and ?-glucosidase activities and in plant \n\ngrowth (plant cover, plant height, length of young leaves, fresh biomass). In addition, plants from \n\namended treatments presented lower concentrations of hazardous elements in shoots than plants \n\nfrom unamended control. The presence of the plant did not increase the available concentrations of \n\nhazardous elements in wastes, except for As when 150 Mg/ha of amendments were applied. \n\nPhytostabilization with C. ladanifer using a Technosol, resulting from the application of the studied \n\namendments at 75 and 150 Mg/ha to gossan materials seems a promising solution for rehabilitation of \n\nthis type of mine wastes. \n\n \n\nKEYWORDS S\u00e3o Domingos mine \u2022 Phytostabilization \u2022 Enzymatic activities \n\n \n\n\n\nImprovement of chemical and biological properties of gossan mine wastes following application of amendments and growth of \nCistus ladanifer L. \n\n240 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBaseado no artigo publicado: E.S.

Mine wastes from \n\nPortuguese IPB have high total concentrations of several chemical elements and usually also acid-\n\ngenerating solid phases in some wastes (e.g. smelting ashes, milled pyrite) that can intensify their \n\nenvironmental impact, due to enhanced availability of chemical elements that can be transported by \n\nsurface runoff to adjacent areas and/or leaching, and delay natural attenuation of mine wastes (Abreu \n\net al., 2010a; Matos and Martins, 2006). Nevertheless, these mine tailings usually have sparse \n\nvegetation with slow natural colonization and scarce biodiversity.  \n\nThe S\u00e3o Domingos mine (SE Portugal, Portuguese IPB) was exploited from the pre-roman period \n\nuntil 1960 decade, both in the gossan and volcanogenic massive sulfides ore deposits. Nowadays, \n\nthis mine is abandoned and have large amounts of different mining wastes sparsely dispersed, which \n\nreach a total volume of 10.8 x 10\n6\n m\n\n3\n, with high total concentrations of hazardous chemical elements \n\n(\u00c1lvarez-Valero et al., 2008; Matos and Martins, 2006). Considering the metal mobility, mass/volume \n\nand the bioavailable fraction of the potential contaminants, the gossan wastes represent the fourth \n\nmost hazardous mine waste in S\u00e3o Domingos mine (modern slag > leaching tanks > country rocks > \n\ngossan wastes; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2008), with approximately 1.7 x 10\n6\n m\n\n3\n of this material/residue \n\n(\u00c1lvarez-Valero et al., 2008). \n\nPhytostabilization is considered an in situ green technology appropriate for the rehabilitation of \n\nmine wastes and multi-elemental contaminated soils in the Mediterranean basin (Abreu and \n\nMagalh\u00e3es, 2009; EPA, 2000; Mendez and Maier, 2008; Tordoff et al., 2000). According to these \n\nauthors, the importance of a plant cover is related to the improvement of the physical (e.g. structure), \n\nchemical (e.g. increase of organic matter and nutrients, immobilization of contaminants, decreased \n\nleaching) and biological (e.g. increase of microbial activity and diversity) characteristics of soil or \n\nwastes (Abreu and Magalh\u00e3es, 2009 and references therein). Plants also restore ecosystem functions \n\nand lead to ecological succession, without requiring further disposal of the resulting biomass (EPA, \n\n2000).  \n\nCistus ladanifer L. is considered a good option for phytostabilization of mine wastes and soils \n\ndeveloped on mine wastes as it is already present in several mining areas from the Portuguese IPB \n\n(Alvarenga et al., 2004; Batista et al., 2009; Freitas et al., 2004; Santos et al., 2009, 2012, 2014). \n\nHowever, this species grows slowly and has a small germination rate, due to the conditions of the \n\nmine substrata and Mediterranean climate (e.g. nutritional constraints, drought, intense irradiance, \n\nhigh total concentrations of trace elements), which are disadvantages for the success of \n\nphytostabilization. \n\nApplication of amendments can speed up the phytostabilization of the mine wastes (Abreu and \n\nMagalh\u00e3es, 2009; Adriano et al., 2004; EPA, 2000; Mac\u00edas, 2004; Mac\u00edas et al., 2011). Several \n\norganic and inorganic wastes that can be used as amendments would otherwise end up in landfills \n\n(Mac\u00edas, 2004; Mac\u00edas et al., 2011). In general, the amendments improve substrata structure and \n\n\n\nImprovement of chemical and biological properties of gossan mine wastes following application of amendments and growth of \nCistus ladanifer L. \n\n242 \n\n \n\nincrease the nutrients and organic matter contents and water-holding capacity, essential \n\ncharacteristics in the rehabilitation of Mediterranean mining areas, and can also immobilize hazardous \n\nelements by several chemical processes (Adriano et al., 2004; Kumpiene et al., 2008; Tordoff et al., \n\n2000), although some of these effects may not last long (Mac\u00edas, 2004; Mac\u00edas et al., 2011). In \n\naddition, mixtures of amendments should be adjusted to the conditions of each mine waste in order to \n\nproduce a specific Technosol that promotes and maintains biogeochemical processes and reduces \n\navailability of contaminants to plants (Mac\u00edas, 2004; Mac\u00edas et al., 2011; Yao et al., 2009).  \n\nThis study aimed to: evaluate the influence of combined use of different application rates of \n\namendments and C. ladanifer growth on the improvement of chemical and biological properties of \n\ngossan wastes from the S\u00e3o Domingos mine; and assess the growth and accumulation of chemical \n\nelements of C. ladanifer during a phytostabilisation process. \n\n \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n\nExperimental set-up \n\n \n\nComposite samples (0?20 cm deep, nine subsamples, a total of approximately 90 kg) of mining \n\nwastes, which are composed of gossan materials mixed with host rocks (hereinafter named as gossan \n\nwastes ? GW), and seeds from C. ladanifer (50 plants) were collected near of the open pit of S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos mine in 2009. This waste material was chosen due to the large amounts of trace elements, \n\nthe corresponding potential environmental risk they pose (\u00c1lvarez-Valero et al., 2008; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et \n\nal., 2008) and the fact that the area is already naturally colonized by autochthones plants.  \n\nThe amendment applied was a mixture (1:1:1) of used rockwool from strawberry production in \n\nhydroponics, plant remains from several berries and substrate used in strawberry crops at 2:3 m/m, \n\nand wastes from liquor distillation of Arbutus unedo L. fruits (regional liquor). The proportion and type \n\nof organic and inorganic wastes used were chosen because of their physical and chemical properties \n\nand large quantities available near the mine at almost \u201czero cost\u201d. These wastes are usually deposited \n\nin various locations without any treatment or legal permission.  \n\nThe GW and amendment were air-dried before use. A microcosm assay was set up with four \n\ntreatments (unamended control and application of the amendment at 30, 75 and 150 Mg /ha, each \n\nwith six replicates) in pots containing about 2 kg of GW (fraction &lt;10 mm) mixed manually with the \n\norganic/inorganic wastes.  \n\nAfter 15 days of incubation at 70 % of the maximum water-holding capacity, C. ladanifer was sown \n\n(0.5 g seeds per pot) in half of the pots from each treatment (n = 3), while the other three pots \n\nremained bare. The seeds were pre-treated for optimal germination (heating at 100 \u00b0C for 30 min; \n\nCorral et al., 1990). All pots (with and without plants) were kept at 70 % of the maximum water-holding \n\ncapacity in a greenhouse for 505 days. \n\nPlants were thinned to 60 and 35 plants per pot 50 and 167 days after sowing, respectively, to \n\nminimize plant competition. Nitrogen was applied 280 days after sowing as an aqueous solution \n\ncorresponding to 50 mg N/kg per pot in the form of calcium nitrate. \n\n \n\n\n\nImprovement of chemical and biological properties of gossan mine wastes following application of amendments and growth of \nCistus ladanifer L. \n\n243 \n\n \n\nExperimental monitoring and analytical methods \n\n \n\nThe initial materials (fraction &lt;2 mm of GW and total fraction of organic and inorganic wastes) \n\nwere characterized for pH and electrical conductivity (EC) in water suspension (1:2.5 m/V), organic C \n\n(Tinsley method), extractable P and K (Egner-Riehm method), total N (Kjeldahl method) and multi-\n\nelemental concentrations, which were analysed by atomic emission spectrometry with induced plasma \n\nand instrumental neutron activation analysis after acid digestion with HClO4 + HNO3 + HCl + HF \n\n(Actlabs, ISO/IEC 17025, Activation Laboratories, 2014). In GW (fraction &lt;2 mm), Fe from iron oxides \n\n(de Endredy, 1963) and Mn from manganese oxides (Chao, 1972) were also determined. Particle size \n\ndistribution of GW (total fraction) was determined by sieving and sedimentation, with the clay fraction \n\n(&lt;2 ?m) separated from coarser materials (&lt;2 mm) after water dispersion and sedimentation \n\nfollowing Stokes law. \n\nAt the beginning (after 15 days of incubation and before sowing) and end of the experiment (505 \n\ndays after sowing), composite samples of the materials from each pot were collected (0?15 cm of \n\ndepth).  These samples were homogenised and sieved (&lt;2 mm). A part of these samples were kept \n\nfresh (4 ?C) for soil enzymatic analysis and determination of multi-elemental concentration in the \n\navailable fraction while the remaining subsamples were air-dried for analysis of pH, EC, organic C, \n\ntotal N and extractable P and K, by the same methodologies referred above.  \n\nTo determine the available fraction, elements were extracted from GW by the rhizosphere-based \n\nmethod, which uses a 10 mM mixture of organic acids (acetic acid + lactic acid + citric acid + malic \n\nacid + formic acid; Feng et al., 2005).  \n\nSeveral enzymatic activities were analysed as biological parameters to evaluate the rehabilitation \n\nprocess, namely: dehydrogenase (Tabatabai, 1994), ?-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21; Eivazi and \n\nTabatabai, 1988), acid phosphomonoesterase (acid phosphatase EC 3.1.3.2; Eivazi and Tabatabai, \n\n1977) and urease (EC 3.5.1.5; Kandeler and Gerber, 1988). Dehydrogenase was used as an index of \n\noverall microbial activity while other enzymatic activities are related to C, P and N cycling. \n\nThe percentage of vegetation cover was determined 25 and 50 days after sowing, (Qu and de \n\nVarennes, 2010) and plant growth was analysed at each thinning (dominant plant height and length of \n\nyoung leaves and fresh biomass). At the end of the experiment, roots and shoots (composed of leaves \n\nand twigs) of C. ladanifer plants were collected. Plant samples were washed with tap water and then \n\nwith distilled water. After washing, the roots were sonicated in distilled water for 30 minutes. Plant \n\nsamples were dried (40 \u00baC), homogenised and finely ground. Elements (except N) were extracted from \n\nsamples with ultrapure concentrated nitric acid (69 %) under pressure in a microwave digester during \n\n2 min at 85 \u00baC + 5 min at 145 \u00baC + 5 min at 200 \u00baC + 18 min at 200 \u00baC. Total concentration of N was \n\nanalysed by combustion with a Leco analyser. Certified reference samples of bush branches and \n\nleaves (NCSDC73348) and blanks were used in parallel to control the accuracy of the method. \n\nThe aqueous solutions from GW and plant extracts were stored at \u201318 \u00baC until analysed for Al, Ca, \n\nCu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn by flame atomic absorption spectrometry and As by graphite furnace \n\natomic absorption spectrometry. \n\n \n\n\n\nImprovement of chemical and biological properties of gossan mine wastes following application of amendments and growth of \nCistus ladanifer L. \n\n244 \n\n \n\nData analysis \n\n \n\nData were analysed by a one way ANOVA and the Duncan test (p &lt;0.05) used to separate means, \n\nusing the statistical programme SPSS v18.0 for Windows. For statistical purposes, the results below \n\nthe detection limit were assumed as half of the detection limit. Bivariate Pearson correlations were \n\nused to correlate GW and plant characteristics (r  > 0.90). Quality control of the analyses was made by \n\nanalytical replicate samples (except for the total concentration of the chemical elements in GW and \n\norganic/inorganic wastes), use of certified standards solutions and reference plant samples, and \n\nlaboratory standards at the international accredited laboratory (Activation Laboratories).  \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nCharacterization of gossan mine wastes and amendments  \n\n \n\nGossan wastes from the S\u00e3o Domingos mine had a clay loam texture, acid pH, small EC and a \n\nfertility characterised by low concentrations of organic C, total N and extractable P, but medium \n\nconcentrations of extractable K (Table 1). These materials had great total concentrations of several \n\npotential hazardous elements (g/kg ? Al: 24.8, As: 3.03, Cu: 0.23, Fe: 129; Pb: 9.21; Table 1) and \n\ncould be considered as contaminated with As, Cu and Pb for commercial and industrial uses (CCME, \n\n2007). Concentrations of some elements (e.g. As, Cu, Pb and Zn), as well as other chemical \n\nproperties studied in this GW (Table 1), were in the same range as those reported for other gossan \n\nwastes from S\u00e3o Domingos (\u00c1lvarez-Valero et al., 2008; de Varennes et al., 2010; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., \n\n2008; Santos et al., 2012, 2013a). \n\nThe concentrations of elements in the available fraction were small varying between 0.01 and 5.7 \n\n% of the total concentrations, with the exception of Ca which was 23.2 % of the total concentration. \n\nAlthough the available fraction can change with time, space and the extraction solution used (Adriano, \n\n2001; Kabata-Pendias, 2004), small concentrations of As, Cu, Fe, Pb and Zn in the available fractions \n\nwere also obtained in same type of mine wastes from S\u00e3o Domingos by P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al. (2008) and \n\nSantos et al. (2012). According to these authors, the presence of these elements mainly in the \n\nresidual fraction, but also in iron and manganese oxides and/or organic matter can explain their low \n\navailability. In addition, the presence of solid phases in the residual fraction, with low solubility, like \n\narsenates containing Pb and Pb+Fe can also contribute for their low availability (Santos et al., 2012). \n\nAll the wastes used as amendment had chemical properties considered useful and safe for land \n\napplication and rehabilitation of GW. Values of pH and concentrations of total N, organic C and \n\nextractable P and K as well as total concentrations of several nutrients (Ca, Mg, Mn, P and Zn) in the \n\namendments were larger than those in GW (Table 1). The C:N ratio depended on the type of residue \n\n(rockwool = 11; plant remains = 31; substrate used in strawberry crops = 60 and wastes from liquor \n\ndistillation of A. unedo fruits = 9) suggesting different mineralization rates and release of N (de \n\nVarennes, 2003), which can be an advantage, in the medium-term, for the phytostabilization. \n\nConcentrations of hazardous elements in the amendments were much lower than those in GW, except \n\n\n\nImprovement of chemical and biological properties of gossan mine wastes following application of amendments and growth of \nCistus ladanifer L. \n\n245 \n\n \n\nfor Al in rockwool (Table 1). Although EC values of organic and inorganic wastes were higher than \n\nthose in GW their application is without any environmental risk. \n\nTable 1 Chemical characteristics of the gossan wastes from the S\u00e3o Domingos mine and of organic and inorganic \n\nwastes used as amendments. \n\n GW AgrW ArbW RW \n\npH (H2O) 4.32 6.68 \u2013 7.18 4.91 7.08 \n\nEC (mS/cm)&lt;0.1 0.9 \u2013 3.5 1.7 3.5 \n\nC organic (g/kg) 12.0 286.1 442.6 111.0 \n\nTotal N (g/kg) 0.04 10.94 \u2013 19.18 9.26 12.93 \n\nExtractable P (g/kg) 1.3 x 10\n-3\n\n 0.34 \u2013 3.15 0.18 7.92 \n\nExtractable K (g/kg) 0.08 0.17 \u2013 6.56 3.57 0.73 \n\nFe in iron oxides (g/kg) 74.32 -- -- -- \n\nMn in Mn oxides (mg/kg) 3.00 -- -- -- \n\nTotal concentrations (g/kg) \n\nAl 24.8 4.06 1.37 53.4 \n\nAs 3.03 2.3 x 10\n-3\n\n 1.0 x 10\n-3\n\n &lt;0.5 x 10\n-3\n\n \n\nCa 0.5 22.56 10.30 139 \n\nCu 0.23 44.6 x 10\n-3\n\n 0.12 0.08 \n\nFe 129 2.96 3.30 39.90 \n\nK 21.2 1.50 > 1.32 6.80 \n\nMg 1.2 2.37 1.13 42.10 \n\nMn 62.0 x 10\n-3\n\n 0.25 51.2 x 10\n-3\n\n 1.85 \n\nNa 1.7 0.31 0.40 13.10 \n\nP 1.08 NA NA 6.63 \n\nPb 9.21 5.05 x 10\n-3\n\n 3.1 x 10\n-3\n\n &lt;3 x 10\n-3\n\n \n\nS 13.7 NA NA 2.60 \n\nZn 36.0 x 10\n-3\n\n 75.6 x 10\n-3\n\n 27.3 x 10\n-3\n\n 0.20 \n\nEC: Electrical conductivity; GW: gossan wastes; AgrW: Agriculture wastes (substrate used in strawberry crops - plant remains \nfrom several berries); ArbW: residue from the liquor distillation of Arbutus unedo L. fruit; RW: Rockwool \n \n\nCharacterization of the microcosm experiment \n\nGeneral chemical properties of the materials \n\n \n\nAt the beginning of the experiment (after 15 days of incubation and before sowing) and at the end \n\nof the experiment (505 days after sowing) amendment application improved the structure of GW (data \n\nnot shown). They also increased the organic matter content and, consequently, the water-holding \n\ncapacity. Values of pH from amended GW increased in both sampling periods (more than 0.4 units \n\ncompared to the control) as well as the EC at the beginning of the experiment, compared to the control \n\n(Table 2). However, the EC values in amended GW were still small (&lt;748 \u00b5S/cm), compared to the \n\napplication of other amendments like sewage sludge, sewage sludge+sugar beet sludge and \n\n\n\nImprovement of chemical and biological properties of gossan mine wastes following application of amendments and growth of \nCistus ladanifer L. \n\n246 \n\n \n\nmunicipal solid waste compost in other contaminated soils (Alvarenga et al., 2008a,b). At small \n\napplication rates, the reduction of EC with time can be related to leaching of the chemical elements in \n\ntreatments without plants and uptake of elements when plants were present. \n\nTable 2 Characteristics of gossan wastes from different treatments (control and materials with amendment \n\napplied at 30, 75 and 150 Mg/ha) at the beginning (after 15 days of incubation and before sowing) and end of the \n\nexperiment (505 days after incubation with and without Cistus ladanifer growth) (mean \u00b1 SD; n = 3).  \n\n  Amended treatments \n\n Control 30 Mg/ha 75 Mg/ha 150 Mg/ha \n\nAfter 15 days of incubation \n\npH (H2O) 3.74 \u00b1 0.03\ncC\n\n 4.10 \u00b1 0.24\nbB\n\n 4.46 \u00b1 0.18\nbB\n\n 5.22 \u00b1 0.37\naB\n\n \n\nEC (\u00b5S/cm) 194 \u00b1 10\ncA\n\n 365 \u00b1 94\nbcA\n\n 515 \u00b1 284\nabA\n\n 748 \u00b1 57\naA\n\n \n\nC organic (g/kg) 1.66 \u00b1 0.22\ncA\n\n 3.10 \u00b1 0.61\ncC\n\n 6.12 \u00b1 0.60\nbC\n\n 13.35 \u00b1 4.42\naA\n\n \n\nTotal N (g/kg) 0.22 \u00b1 0.06\ncA\n\n 0.32 \u00b1 0.06\ncA\n\n 0.51 \u00b1 0.04\nbB\n\n 0.90 \u00b1 0.27\naA\n\n \n\nExtractable P (g/kg) &lt;0.02\ncA\n\n 0.16 \u00b1 0.06\nbA\n\n 0.09 \u00b1 0.05\nbB\n\n 1.15 \u00b1 0.19\naB\n\n \n\nExtractable K (g/kg) 1.51 \u00b1 0.13\nbA\n\n 1.77 \u00b1 0.18\nbA\n\n 3.09 \u00b1 0.11\naA\n\n 2.63 \u00b1 0.72\naAB\n\n \n\nAfter 505 days of incubation without plants \n\npH (H2O) 3.92 \u00b1 0.03\ndB\n\n 4.60 \u00b1 0.31\ncA\n\n 5.20 \u00b1 0.21\nbA\n\n 6.13 \u00b1 0.04\naA\n\n \n\nEC (\u00b5S/cm) 116 \u00b1 10\u00aa\nB\n 117 \u00b1 16\n\naB\n 136 \u00b1 17\n\naB\n 146 \u00b1 47\n\naB\n \n\nC organic (g/kg) 1.70 \u00b1 0.87\ncA\n\n 4.87 \u00b1 0.85\ncB\n\n 11.12 \u00b1 1.98\nbB\n\n 16.57 \u00b1 3.00\naA\n\n \n\nTotal N (g/kg) 0.29 \u00b1 0.07\nbA\n\n 0.44 \u00b1 0.17\nbA\n\n 0.65 \u00b1 0.25\nabA\n\n 1.29 \u00b1 0.04\naA\n\n \n\nExtractable P (g/kg) &lt;0.02\ndA\n\n 0.48 \u00b1 0.29\nbA\n\n 0.13 \u00b1 0.03\ncB\n\n 1.08 \u00b1 0.16\naB\n\n \n\nExtractable K (g/kg) 1.45 \u00b1 0.16\nbA\n\n 1.88 \u00b1 0.85\nbA\n\n 3.07 \u00b1 0.24\naA\n\n 3.55 \u00b1 0.09\naA\n\n \n\nAfter 505 days of incubation with plants \n\npH (H2O) 4.07 \u00b1 0.03\ncA\n\n 4.58 \u00b1 0.03\nbA\n\n 5.52 \u00b1 0.19\naA\n\n 5.77 \u00b1 0.23\naA\n\n \n\nEC (\u00b5S/cm) 155 \u00b1 26\nbB\n\n 176 \u00b1 31\nbB\n\n 231 \u00b1 6\nbB\n\n 577 \u00b1 259\naA\n\n \n\nC organic (g/kg) 2.29 \u00b1 0.38\ncA\n\n 7.48 \u00b1 0.83\ncA\n\n 15.44 \u00b1 1.40\nbA\n\n 22.09 \u00b1 6.90\naA\n\n \n\nTotal N  (g/kg) 0.23 \u00b1 0.01\ncA\n\n 0.43 \u00b1 0.02\ncA\n\n 0.81 \u00b1 0.10\nbA\n\n 1.22 \u00b1 0.38\naA\n\n \n\nExtractable P (g/kg) &lt;0.02\ncA\n\n 0.41 \u00b1 0.32\nbA\n\n 11.66 \u00b1 2.93\naA\n\n 10.72 \u00b1 2.76\naA\n\n \n\nExtractable K (g/kg) 1.43 \u00b1 0.16\nbA\n\n 1.02 \u00b1 0.19\nbA\n\n 1.27 \u00b1 0.11\nbB\n\n 2.13 \u00b1 0.41\naB\n\n \n\nEC: Electrical conductivity. \nValues for each parameter followed by a different letter are significantly different (p &lt;0.05).

At the end of the \n\nexperiment, the fertility increased in the amended GW with the highest values observed in the \n\ntreatments combining amendment and plants (especially for organic C at application rates of 30 and \n\n75 Mg/ha and extractable P when amendment was applied at 75 and 150 Mg/ha).  \n\n\n\nImprovement of chemical and biological properties of gossan mine wastes following application of amendments and growth of \nCistus ladanifer L. \n\n247 \n\n \n\n In general, the amendment, especially at the highest application rates, and C. ladanifer growth \n\nenhanced much more the pH and fertility of this type of GW than polyacrylate polymers and S. \n\npurpurea (Santos et al., 2013a). \n\n \n\nAvailable fraction of the elements in the materials \n\n \n\nIn both sampling periods, the concentration of Pb was close or below 5 mg/kg, the detection limit of \n\nthe apparatus. Similar results were obtained by Alvarenga et al. (2008b) in contaminated soils from \n\nthe Aljustrel mine amended with different wastes.  \n\nAmendment application, especially at high application rates (75 and 150 Mg/ha) led to increases in \n\nthe concentrations of other hazardous elements (Al and As) and nutrients (except Cu and Zn in the \n\nbeginning and end of the experiment in the presence of plants) in the available fraction in both \n\nsampling periods and independently of the plant (Fig. 1). These high available concentrations are \n\nrelated to the incorporation of rockwool, which had Al in its composition, and nutrients coming from the \n\nremaining nutrient solution used to grow strawberry (Table 1). However, no relationship was obtained \n\nbetween pH and organic C and the available concentrations of the elements. Similar results were \n\nobtained by several authors using the same or other extraction methods (Alvarenga et al., 2008a,b; \n\nBurgos et al., 2010; Santos et al., 2013a). \n\nIn general, the available concentrations of Al, Ca, Fe, K and Mg decreased with time in the \n\nabsence of plants (Fig. 1), although with no clear trend. Similar results were reported for Cu, Mn and \n\nZn with application of different amendments and acid soil by Burgos et al. (2010). Low concentrations \n\nof these elements at the end of the experiment, compared with the beginning, can derive from \n\nchemical reactions and leaching during the experiment. Additionally, application of organic matter can \n\npromote the formation of complexes with cations (although no relationship was obtained in the present \n\nstudy) and increase cationic exchange capacity (Adriano et al., 2004). \n\nIn contrast, the concentration of As (at an application rate of 30 Mg/ha) and Cu and Zn (at \n\napplication rates of 75 and 150 Mg/ha) at the end of the experiment were higher than in the beginning. \n\nIn fact, a considerable fraction of Cu and Zn can be associated with organic matter in the gossan \n\nmaterials (Abreu et al., 2010b; Santos et al., 2012), and the mineralization of the organic matter could \n\npromote the release of these metals. However, no relationship was obtained between available \n\nconcentrations of these metals and increases in organic C with amendment application rate. Inhibition \n\nof the formation of low solubility solid phases (e.g. metal arsenates) could have occurred (Abreu et al., \n\n2009; Santos et al., 2012). \n\nAt the end of the experiment, the presence of plants did not influence the concentrations of Al, Ca, \n\nFe, Mg and Mn in the available fraction of GW, independently of the treatment (Fig. 1). However, the \n\nconcentration of some nutrients decreased with plant growth, namely K in all amended treatments, Cu \n\nin the amended treatment at 150 Mg/ha and Zn in the amended treatments at 75 and 150 Mg/ha. This \n\ncould be related to uptake by plants or more exudation of organic acids by roots, capable of forming \n\ncomplexes and reducing the availability of the cations (Feng et al., 2005; Gonzaga et al., 2012; Tu et \n\nal., 2004).  \n\n\n\nImprovement of chemical and biological properties of gossan mine wastes following application of amendments and growth of \nCistus ladanifer L. \n\n248 \n\n \n\nbA\n\nbB cB\n\naA\n\nbB\nbB\n\naA\n\naB\n\nabB\n\naA\n\naB aB\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\nA\nl \n\nc\no\n\nn\nc\n\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n (\n\nm\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n)\n\nbA bA cA\nbB\n\naA\n\nbAB\nbB\n\naB\n\nbA\naB\n\naB\n\naA\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nA\ns\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\n\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n (\n\nm\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n)\n\ncontrol 30 Mg/ha 75 Mg/ha 150 Mg/ha\n\ndA\ndB dB\n\ncA\n\ncA cA\n\nbA\n\nbB bB\n\naA\n\naB\n\naB\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\n3500\n\n4000\n\n4500\n\nC\na\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\n\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n (\n\nm\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n)\n\naA\nbA\n\naAbA bA\nbA\n\ncB bA\nbA\n\ncB\n\naA\n\ncB\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\nC\nu\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\n\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n (\n\nm\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n)\n\nbA\n\nbB\ncB\n\nbA\n\nbAB\n\nbB\n\naA\n\naA\n\naA\n\naA\n\naB\n\naB\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nF\ne\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\n\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n (\n\nm\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n)\n\ndA\n\nbB bB\n\ncA\nbB\n\nbC\n\nbA\naA\n\nbB\n\naA\n\naB\n\naC\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\nK\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\n\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n (\n\nm\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n)\n\ncA\nbB dB\n\nbA\n\nbA\ncA\n\naA\n\naB\n\nbB\n\naA\n\naB aB\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\nM\ng\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\n\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n (\n\nm\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n)\n\ncA dA\ncA\n\nbA cA\n\ncA\n\nabA\n\nbA\n\nbA\n\naA aA\n\naA\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nM\nn\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\n\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n (\n\nm\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n)\n\ncA cA\ndB\n\nbA bA\ncA\n\naA\n\naA\n\nbA\n\naA\n\naA\n\naA\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n200\n\nBeginning Without plants With plants\n\nN\na\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\n\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n (\n\nm\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n)\n\nEnd of the experiment\n\naA cA\naA\n\naA bcA\naA\n\naA\n\nbB\n\naA\naB\n\naA\n\naB\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\nBeginning Without plants With plants\n\nZ\nn\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\n\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n (\n\nm\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n)\n\nEnd of the experiment  \n\nFig. 1 Effects of treatments (control and gossan wastes with amendment application at 30, 75 and 150 Mg/ha) \n\nand presence of Cistus ladanifer on the concentration of chemical elements in the available fraction of gossan \n\nwastes at the beginning (after 15 days of incubation and before sowing) and end of the experiment (505 days \n\nafter sowing) (Mean \u00b1 SD; n = 3).

The same behaviour was observed in \n\na mesoscosm experiment using soils developed on gossan with different types of polyacrylate \n\npolymers and S. purpurea and natural plant colonization (Santos et al., 2013a). The increase of \n\ndissolved organic carbon in the rhizosphere due to exudation of low-molecular-weight organic acids by \n\nroots as well as changes in the composition of root exudates may explain the high As availability \n\n(Feng et al., 2005; Gonzaga et al., 2012; Tu et al., 2004). Thus, high application rates of amendments \n\ncan contribute to an increase of low-molecular-weight organic acids and affect the availability of As. \n\nOrganic acids can also form complexes with cations or block As adsorption sites on soil particles as \n\niron oxides (Feng et al., 2005; Gonzaga et al., 2012; Tu et al., 2004). Root exudates of Pteris vittata L. \n\n(an As hyperaccumulating Chinese Brake fern) and Nephrolepis exaltata L. (an As-sensitive Boston \n\nfern) dissolved significant amounts of As from two arsenates (Tu et al., 2004). Low-molecular-weight \n\norganic acids can also release As from Fe?, Mn? and Al?oxides or hydroxides in contaminated soils \n\n(Zang et al., 2005).  \n\nAlthough GW had large total concentrations of some elements (e.g. Al, As, Cu and Pb), the \n\nconcentrations potentially available for organisms (C. ladanifer and microorganisms involved in \n\nbiogeochemical cycles) after amendment application represented a low potential environmental risk, \n\nwith the increase of nutrient availability being an advantage for the rehabilitation process.  \n\n \n\nEnzymatic activities in the materials \n\n \n\nEnzymatic activities (Fig. 2) were used as biological indicators to monitor the phytostabilization of \n\nGW. The smallest values of dehydrogenase and ?-glucosidase activities were obtained in the control \n\n(0.71-1.78 \u00b5g TPF g\n-1\n\n 16h\n-1\n\n and 0.03-0.05 \u00b5mol ?-nitrophenol g\n-1\n\n h-1, respectively). However, urease \n\nand phosphatase activities in the same treatment (0.81-1.14 \u00b5mol N-NH?? g\n-1\n\n 2h\n-1\n\n and 0.64-1.06 \u00b5mol \n\n?-nitrophenol g\n-1\n\n h\n-1\n\n, respectively) were similar or even higher than in the amended treatments (&lt;\n\ndetection limit-0.91 \u00b5mol N-NH?? g\n-1\n\n 2h\n-1\n\n and 0.51-1.17 \u00b5mol ?-nitrophenol g\n-1\n\n h\n-1\n\n, respectively), \n\ndepending on sampling date. Only phosphatase and ?-glucosidase activities were influenced \n\npositively (?1.4-fold greater) by the presence of plants. A similar behaviour for all enzymatic activities, \n\nexcept ?-glucosidase, was reported in a microcosm assays where gossan materials from the S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos mine were also used and where Briza maxima L., S. purpurea and Chaetopogon \n\nfasciculatus (Link) Hayek were present (de Varennes et al., 2010).  \n\nIn general, soil microorganisms, evaluated by the dehydrogenase activity, benefited from the \n\npresence of plants and amendment application, especially at higher application rates (75 and 150 \n\nMg/ha). Increase of this activity was also verified with addition of several organic and inorganic \n\namendments to contaminated soils with and without plants (Alvarenga et al., 2008b; Burgos et al., \n\n2010). The ?-glucosidase activity was also greater in amended GW compared to control, but the \n\npresence of plants did not affect its activity over that of bare GW. An increase in organic C and pH in \n\nthe amended GW can explain the highest activities of dehydrogenase (0.95 &lt;r &lt;0.97 and 0.85 &lt;r &lt;\n\n0.93, depending on sampling period and presence of plants) and ?-glucosidase (0.90 &lt;r &lt;0.98 and \n\n\n\nImprovement of chemical and biological properties of gossan mine wastes following application of amendments and growth of \nCistus ladanifer L. \n\n250 \n\n \n\n0.90 &lt;r &lt;0.94, depending on sampling date). The effect of these two soil parameters in ?-glucosidase \n\nactivity was also reported by Alvarenga et al. (2008a).  \n\nFor phosphatase and urease activities, no clear tendency was observed between treatments in \n\nagreement with the results obtained by the application of some organic and inorganic wastes \n\ncombined with plant growth (L. perenne and L. multiflorum) in contaminated soils from the Aljustrel \n\nmine (Alvarenga et al., 2008a,b),  \n\nIn general, a positive effect of root exudates, availability of nutrients and organic C and/or pH \n\nincrease derived from amendment application to gossan materials (especially with high application \n\nrates) on dehydrogenase and other soil enzymes related to nutrient cycling was observed. \n\n \n\nFig. 2 Effects of treatments (control and gossan wastes with amendment application at 30, 75 and 150 Mg/ha) \n\nand presence of Cistus ladanifer on enzymatic activities at the beginning (after 15 days of incubation and before \n\nsowing) and end of the experiment (505 days after sowing) (Mean \u00b1 SD; n = 3).

However, the \n\nimprovement of structure and water-holding capacity, due to the incorporation of rockwool and organic \n\nwastes, may explain the larger area covered by C. ladanifer in amended treatments. Wang et al. \n\n(2008) reported that an unfavourable physical structure in tailings from the Xiangtan mine was the \n\nmost significant constraint for the establishment of natural vegetation. In addition, the improvement of \n\nwater-holding capacity by hydrophilic polyacrylate polymers application to soils developed on gossan \n\nalso enhanced soil cover and growth of S. purpurea, B. maxima and C. fasciculatus (de Varennes et \n\nal., 2010; Qu and de Varennes, 2010). \n\nPlants were taller, accumulated morefresh biomass in roots and shoots, and had larger young \n\nleaves in the amended GW than in control; their survival rate was also greater (Amended treatments: \n\n66?89 %; Control: 66?89 %) (Tables 4 and 5). However, in general, no significant differences among \n\namended treatments were observed. During all the experiment, the higher available concentrations of \n\nnutrients and organic C in GW by amendment application (Fig. 1 and Table 2) led to better growth of \n\nC. ladanifer (Tables 4 and 5) in agreement with the reported by several authors using different \n\namendments, contaminated soils/mine wastes and plant species (Alvarenga et al., 2008b; Conesa et \n\nal., 2007; de Varennes et al., 2010; Qu and de Varennes, 2010; Santos et al., 2013a). Moreover, no \n\nnegative influence of the hazardous elements in the GW available fraction on growth of C. ladanifer \n\nwas observed. \n\nThe reduction of the root-shoot ratio (dry weight of root biomass/dry weight of shoot biomass) from \n\n0.6 in control to 0.3?0.4 in amended treatments, also suggests a plant response to more favourable \n\ngrowing conditions (Harris, 1992). In this way, improvement of the fertility of GW was of major \n\nimportance for the success of phytostabilization, especially in early stages of plant growth (Conesa et \n\nal., 2007; Tordoff et al., 2000).   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nImprovement of chemical and biological properties of gossan mine wastes following application of amendments and growth of \nCistus ladanifer L. \n\n252 \n\n \n\nTable 4 Effects of treatments (control and gossan wastes with amendment applied at 30, 75 and 150 Mg/ha) on \n\nC. ladanifer growth 50, 167 and 505 days after sowing (minimum \u2013 maximum; mode; n = 3). \n\n  Amended treatments \n\nPlant parameters (cm) Control 30 Mg/ha 75 Mg/ha 150 Mg/ha \n\n50 days \n\nPlant height \n1.0 \u2013 1.5 \n\n1.0 \n\n1.5 \u2013 4.0 \n\n3.0 \n\n1.0 \u2013 3.0 \n\n2.0 \n\n1.0 \u2013 4.0 \n\n2.0 \n\nYoung leaves length \n0.5 \u2013 0.7 \n\n0.5 \n\n0.5 \u2013 1.5 \n\n1.0 \n\n1.0 \u2013 2.0 \n\n1.0 \n\n1.0 \u2013 1.5 \n\n1.0 \n\n167 days \n\nPlant height \n1.5 \u2013 3.0 \n\n2.5 \n\n3.5 \u2013 6.0 \n\n3.5 \n\n4.0 \u2013 6.5 \n\n4.5 \n\n4.5 \u2013 7.0 \n\n5.0 \n\nYoung leaves length \n0.6 \u2013 1.0 \n\n0.6 \n\n0.8 \u2013 1.0 \n\n1.0 \n\n1.0 \u2013 2.0 \n\n1.0 \n\n1.5 \u2013 2.5 \n\n1.5 \n\n505 days (end of the experiment) \n\nPlant height \n3.0 \u2013 7.0 \n\n4.0 \n\n7.0 \u2013 16.0 \n\n13.0 \n\n12.0 \u2013 20.0 \n\n13.0 \n\n12.0 \u2013 18.0 \n\n13.0 \n\nYoung leaves length \n1.0 \u2013 2.5 \n\n2.0 \n\n2.5 \u2013 4.0 \n\n2.5 \n\n2.5 \u2013 4.0 \n\n3.5 \n\n3.0 \u2013 4.0 \n\n4.0 \n\n \n \n\nTable 5 Effects of treatments (control and gossan wastes with amendment applied at 30, 75 and 150 Mg/ha) on \n\ngrowth of roots and shoots of C. ladanifer 505 days after sowing (minimum \u2013 maximum; mean; n = 3).  \n\n  Amended treatments \n\nFresh biomass weight (g) Control 30 Mg/ha 75 Mg/ha 150 Mg/ha \n\nTotal roots \n2.4 \u2013 7.7 \n\n4.2\nb\n \n\n13.5 \u2013 10.0 \n\n15.5\na\n \n\n13.8 \u2013 17.3 \n\n15.5\na\n \n\n11.3 \u2013 13.0 \n\n12.2\na\n \n\nRoots per plant \n0.08 \u2013 0.25 \n\n0.15\nb\n \n\n0.41 \u2013 0.61 \n\n0.50\na\n \n\n0.36 \u2013 0.48 \n\n0.44\na\n \n\n0.33 \u2013 0.46 \n\n0.38\na\n \n\nTotal shoots \n5.2 \u2013 7.6 \n\n6.4\nc\n \n\n28.5 \u2013 40.8 \n\n34.5\nb\n \n\n40.0 \u2013 53.5 \n\n44.8\na\n \n\n40.3 \u2013 45.8 \n\n42.6\nab\n\n \n\nShoots per plant \n0.18 \u2013 0.30 \n\n0.23\nb\n \n\n0.98 \u2013 1.32 \n\n1.10\na\n \n\n1.07 \u2013 1.49 \n\n1.27\na\n \n\n1.09 \u2013 1.49 \n\n1.31\na\n \n\nValues for each parameter followed by a different letter are significantly different (p &lt;0.05). \n\n \n\nConcentration of chemical elements in Cistus ladanifer \n\n \n\nDespite the variations in the available concentrations of elements in GW from different treatments \n\n(Fig. 1 and Table 2), no relationship was found between these and the concentrations of elements in \n\n\n\nImprovement of chemical and biological properties of gossan mine wastes following application of amendments and growth of \nCistus ladanifer L. \n\n253 \n\n \n\nC. ladanifer (roots and shoots; Tables 6 and 7).

In addition, the values of As and Pb in shoots from control \n\nreached values considered phytotoxic for plants (Kabata-Pendias, 2011). Although the accumulation \n\ndepended on the plant species and amendments applied, similar results (higher concentrations in \n\n\n\nImprovement of chemical and biological properties of gossan mine wastes following application of amendments and growth of \nCistus ladanifer L. \n\n254 \n\n \n\nshoots from control than amended treatments) were also reported by Qu and de Varennes (2010) \n\nusing different amendments and plant species in a soil developed on gossan.  \n\nIn shoots from all treatments, the concentrations of micronutrients and Ca were within the range \n\nconsidered sufficient for various plant species but concentrations of N, K and Mg are not considered \n\nadequate for growth (Kabata-Pendias, 2011; de Varennes, 2003).

Plants from control had an intensive \n\nuptake of the elements (even the hazardous) and accumulation of nutrients in photosynthetic active \n\norgans, whereas plants from amended treatments restricted the translocation to shoots of hazardous \n\nelements such as As and Pb. In this way, amendments application is an advantage for the success of \n\nphytostabilization. \n\n \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n\n \n\nThe gossan waste studied had limiting characteristic for Cistus ladanifer growth, namely high total \n\nconcentrations of several elements (Al, As, Cu, Fe, K and Pb), low fertility and acid pH although only a \n\nsmall percentage of the elements was in bioavailable forms. Amendment application, especially at 75 \n\nand 150 Mg/ha, improved physical (structure) and chemical properties (fertility, pH, concentrations of \n\nnutrients in the available fraction) of the gossan waste and increased enzymatic activities related to \n\nnutrient cycling and microbial activity. In addition, plants from the amended treatments had lower \n\nconcentrations of hazardous elements in shoots than those from the control, minimizing potential \n\nbioaccumulation in the food chain. \n\nAlthough C. ladanifer is already present in the S\u00e3o Domingos mine, the improvement in gossan \n\nwaste may stimulate its growth in situ, providing a better plant cover as a result of faster growth during \n\nthe phytostabilization process.  \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors would like to thank Madre Fruta (Hubel Group) for providing \n\nthe agriculture wastes and rockwool and Mr. Jos\u00e9 G.

COMBINED REHABILITATION OF GOSSAN AND \n\nSULFIDE-RICH WASTES BY PHYTOSTABILISATION \n\nWITH AUTOCHTHONES SPECIES USING \n\nTECHNOSOLS \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCombined rehabilitation of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes by phytostabilisation with autochthones species using Technosols \n\n261 \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\n \n\nThis study evaluated the recovery efficiency of a system combining two mine wastes: gossan (GW) \n\nand sulfide-rich wastes (SW). Technosols were made by the incorporation of amendment mixtures, at \n\n30 and 60 g/kg, containing agro-industrial residues and GW. These Technosols (or only GW \u2013 control) \n\noverlie the sulfhide-rich wastes, which were isolated from air/water by an alkaline barrier. In the \n\nTechnosols or GW, autochthones plants were developed (phytostabilisation process). Two microcosm \n\nassays, under controlled conditions, were carried out where Cistus ladanifer or Lavandula pedunculata \n\nwere sown and grown for one and three years, respectively. \n\nTechnosols improved the structure, water-holding capacity and pH as well as increased the nutrients \n\nconcentrations in the available fraction of the GW allowing the germination and good development of \n\nboth species. No visual symptoms of deficiency/toxicity were observed although in some cases shoots \n\nhad reached phytotoxic (As or Mn) or deficient (Cu) concentrations. Shoots elements concentrations \n\nwere below the potentially hazardous level for domestic animals intake, and plants behaviours were \n\nadequate to their use in phytostabilisation (high uptake of elements, storage of hazardous elements in \n\nroots, non-accumulators of hazardous elements). Liming components of the barrier stabilised the SW \n\nreducing their oxidation and the ascension of the acid solutions and elements. Technosols were \n\nessential for the implementation of the phytostabilisation process in GW. The system of combined \n\nrehabilitation of GW and SW was efficient and sustainable for long-term. \n\n \n\nKEYWORDS Alkaline barrier \u2022 Cistus ladanifer \u2022 Lavandula pedunculata \u2022 Organic/inorganic wastes \u2022 \n\nS\u00e3o Domingos mine \n\n\n\nCombined rehabilitation of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes by phytostabilisation with autochthones species using Technosols \n\n262 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBaseado no artigo submetido \u00e0 revista Environmental Pollution: Erika S.

S\u00e3o Domingos (SE of Portugal, IPB) is a \n\nmedium-sized mine that was exploited from the pre-roman period until 1960, both in the gossan and \n\nvolcanogenic massive sulfides ore deposits (Matos et al., 2006; Quental et al., 2002). As a result of \n\nthe different periods and techniques of exploration, between 27 and 32 Tg of different wastes were \n\ndisposed over a large area affecting around 3.2 Mm\n2\n of land (\u00c1lvarez-Valero et al., 2008; Matos and \n\nMartins, 2006; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2008; Quental et al., 2002). Each mine waste has different risks \n\nassociated to its mass/volume, chemical composition and potential generation of acid mine drainage \n\n(\u00c1lvarez-Valero et al., 2008; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2008). Taken into account the mobility of some \n\nelements and the mass/volume of gossan (4.1 Tg/1.6 Mm\n3\n) and brittle pyrite (0.06 Tg/0.2 Mm\n\n3\n), these \n\nmaterials represent the fourth and fifth, respectively, most hazardous mine wastes in the S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos mine area (P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2008). \n\nS\u00e3o Domingos, as well as other mines from IPB, have an additional environmental problem \n\nbecause some of their mine wastes are composed of reactive minerals, especially sulfides, which \n\ngenerate acid drainage during all year (Abreu et al., 2010; \u00c1lvarez-Valero et al., 2008; Matos and \n\nMartins, 2006; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2008; Quental et al., 2002; S\u00e1nchez-Espa\u00f1a, 2008). \n\nAmong the in situ technologies and comparing with the engineering techniques, phytostabilisation \n\nis considered the most suitable for the rehabilitation of different mine wastes or soils developed on \n\nmine wastes with multielemental contamination (Abreu and Magalh\u00e3es, 2009; EPA, 2000; Monterroso \n\net al., 1998), namely in arid and semiarid conditions (Mendes and Maier, 2008). Several \n\nenvironmental and economic advantages of this technology are reported by the same authors. \n\nSome autochthones plant species are tolerant to the mining conditions (e.g. high total \n\nconcentrations of trace elements, low pH and fertility and poor structure and water holding capacity) \n\nnaturally colonizing mining areas from IPB, as for instance S\u00e3o Domingos mine (e.g. several species \n\nof Cistus, Lavandula and Erica) (Abreu et al., 2008, 2012a, 2012b; de la Fuente et al., 2010; Freitas et \n\nal., 2004a, 2004b; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2014; Santos et al., 2012, 2014a). However, the sowing and \n\nestablishment of the seedlings directly into tailings and/or soils developed on mine wastes can be very \n\ndifficult or almost impossible, especially in Mediterranean climate (Tordoff et al., 2000). Besides, the \n\nslow growth rate of the plants can also limit the success of the phytostabilisation process.  \n\nApplication of amendments can improve the establishment and development of these plants. In \n\nfact, although Cistus ladanifer is already present in the S\u00e3o Domingos mine, the improvement of the \n\ngossan wastes characteristics (e.g. structure, water-holding capacity, pH and nutrients concentrations \n\nin the available fraction of the materials) can stimulate its growth (Santos et al., 2014b) in situ \n\nproviding a faster and better plant cover during the phytostabilization process. \n\nIn general, the amendments improve essential characteristics of the substrata (e.g. structure, \n\nfertility and water-holding capacity) for growth of plants and other organisms, and can immobilize \n\npotentially hazardous elements by several chemical processes (Adriano et al., 2004; Kumpiene et al., \n\n2008; Tordoff et al., 2000; Wong, 2003). The use of amendments together with the plants contributes \n\n\n\nCombined rehabilitation of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes by phytostabilisation with autochthones species using Technosols \n\n \n\n264 \n\n \n\nto the occurrence of natural attenuation processes, increasing microbial biomass and fertility and \n\nappearance of spontaneous vegetation (Clemente et al., 2006), contributing to the carbon \n\nsequestration. However, some effects of the amendments may not last long (Mac\u00edas, 2004; Mac\u00edas et \n\nal., 2011) being necessary repetitive applications (P\u00e9rez-de-Mora et al., 2011). In addition, \n\namendments mixtures should be adjusted to the physical and chemical conditions of each mine waste \n\nin order to produce a specific Technosol that promotes and keep the biogeochemical processes and \n\nreduces the availability of the potentially hazardous elements (Mac\u00edas, 2004; Mac\u00edas et al., 2011). In \n\nfact, the efficiency of the Technosols in the rehabilitation process of degraded/contaminated areas is \n\nconfirmed in several in micro- and meso-cosmos studies under controlled conditions (Arbestainet al., \n\n2008; Santos et al., 2014b, 2014c, 2015; Yao et al., 2009) as well as in the field (Bola\u00f1os et al., 2015; \n\nMac\u00edas-Garc\u00eda et al., 2009). \n\nPrevious studies (Santos et al., 2014b, 2014c, 2015) demonstrated that although elements \n\nconcentrations (e.g. As, Fe, K, Na, Pb and SO4) and pH in leachates are significantly improved in the \n\nTechnosols composed of sulfide-rich materials and organic/inorganic wastes, this methodology was \n\nnot enough to reduce the sulfides oxidation or buffer leachates acidity. Nonetheless, the use of a \n\nTechnosol obtained from gossan wastes and organic/inorganic wastes can be a promising approach \n\nto isolate sulfide-rich wastes from air allowing plant establishment and reduction of elements leaching \n\nfrom sulfide wastes (Santos et al., 2015). Indeed, in some situations a combined approach involving a \n\ncovering material, which is sown with tolerant plants can have advantages rather any single \n\nconventional approach (Tordoff et al., 2000). \n\nThe main aim of this study was to demonstrate the efficiency of a system, which combined the \n\nrehabilitation of gossan wastes, by the conception of Technosols with agro-industrial wastes and \n\ndevelopment of autochthones plants (phytostabilisation process), and sulfide-rich wastes by its natural \n\nisolation from air/water. For this, the study aimed: i) to demonstrate the efficiency of a alkaline barrier \n\n(limestone wastes and biomass ashes) in the reduction of the upward flow of the acid solution rich in \n\npotentially hazardous elements from SW and decreasing of the leaching; ii) to evaluate the \n\nimprovement of the chemical characteristics of gossan wastes by its inclusion in Technosols; and iii) to \n\nassess the development and accumulation of the elements (potentially hazardous elements and \n\nnutrients) in Lavandula pedunculata and Cistus ladanifer, at mid-term, during a phytostabilisation \n\nprocess with Technosols composed of gossan and organic/inorganic wastes \n\n \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n\nExperimental set-up \n\n \n\nTwo mining wastes from S\u00e3o Domingos, which are mainly composed of gossan materials \n\n(hereinafter named as gossan wastes ? GW) and crushed pyrite and smelting ashes (herein after \n\nnamed as sulfide-rich wastes ? SW) were selected due to their large amounts of potentially hazardous \n\nelements, potential generation of acid mine drainage, wide distribution in the mine area, and, \n\nconsequently, their environmental risk (\u00c1lvarez-Valero et al., 2008; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2008; Quental \n\net al., 2002). Moreover, it was also taken into account the potential of some of these mine wastes \n\n\n\nCombined rehabilitation of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes by phytostabilisation with autochthones species using Technosols \n\n \n\n265 \n\n \n\n(GW) to support the development of autochthones vegetation (Qu and de Varennes, 2010; Santos et \n\nal., 2013a, 2014b, 2015). \n\nComposite samples of those mine wastes and seeds of Lavandula pedunculata (Mill.) Cav. and \n\nCistus ladanifer L. were collected in the S\u00e3o Domingos mining area. Sampling areas of GW and SW \n\nwere located south-west of the open pit, being the SW located near the former leaching tanks. The \n\nSW are bare and exposed to severe water erosion while GW are naturally but sparsely colonized \n\nmainly by Erica australis L.. \n\nThe microcosm assay (n = 8 per treatment) were assembled in the following order (from bottom to \n\ntop, Fig. 1): SW (total fraction at 50 % of water-holding capacity), limestone, biomass ashes and GW \n\nor Technosols (at 70 % of the water-holding capacity). The Technosols (Table 1) were composed of \n\nGW (fraction &lt;10 mm) and different amendment mixtures containing organic/inorganic wastes (equal \n\nproportion of each residue) from agro-industry: plant remains + strawberry substrate at 2:3 m/m \u2013 \n\nAgW; rockwool used for strawberry crops \u2013 RW; and residues from small distilleries ? Arbutus unedo \n\nL. or Ceratonia siliqua L. fruit spirits distillation \u2013 AW, CW, respectively. The amendment mixtures and \n\napplication rates used (Table 1) were based on the results of Santos et al. (2014b, 2015). The GW \n\nand amendment mixtures were mixed manually to create the Technosols. Limestone (L; \u00d8 of 2?3 cm) \n\nand biomass ashes (BA) were used in order to create an alkaline barrier between SW and \n\nGW/Technosols. \n\n \n\nFig. 1 Scheme of the combined rehabilitation system. \n\n\n\nCombined rehabilitation of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes by phytostabilisation with autochthones species using Technosols \n\n \n\n266 \n\n \n\nTable 1 Composition of the Technosols used in the assays. \n\nTechnosol Composition \n\nRate of application of the amendment mixture \n\n(g/kg of mine waste) \n\n(designation) \n\nTA GW + (AgW + AW + RW) 30 (TA30), 60 (TA60) \n\nTB GW + (AgW + CW + RW) 30 (TB30); 60 (TB60) \n\nGW: gossan wastes; AgW: agriculture wastes; AW: residue from the liquor distillation of A. unedo fruit; CW: residue from liquor \ndistillation of C. siliqua fruit; RW: rockwool used for strawberry crops \n\nAll organic and inorganic wastes were used due to their physical and chemical characteristics \n\n(Table 2) and easy obtaining at very low cost (only associated to their transport) and large quantity, \n\nand location near the mine. Moreover, these wastes used in the Technosols are usually deposited in \n\nvarious locations without any treatment or legal permission and valorisation.  \n\nAfter one month of incubation of the GW and Technosols, L. pedunculata was sown (0.5 g seeds \n\nper pot) in half of the pots from each treatment, while in the other pots was sown pre-treated seeds of \n\nC. ladanifer (0.5 g seeds per pot; heating at 100 \u00b0C for 30 min; Corral et al., 1990). All pots were kept \n\nat 70 % of the maximum water-holding capacity under controlled conditions in a greenhouse for one \n\nand three years, for the assays with L. pedunculata and C. ladanifer respectively. Plants were thinned \n\nto 35, 20, 5 and 3 plants per pot after 40, 60, 120 and 180 days after sowing, respectively, to minimize \n\nplant competition. \n\n \n\nExperimental monitoring and sample analyses \n\n \n\nInitial mine wastes and organic/inorganic wastes were analysed for: pH and electrical conductivity \n\n(EC) in water suspension (1:2.5 m/V), organic C (Str\u00f6hlein method), extractable P and K (Egner-\n\nRiehm method), total N (Kjeldahl method) and total multielemental concentrations by ICP and INAA \n\nafter acid digestion with four acids (HClO4 + HNO3 + HCl + HF; Activation Laboratories, 2014). For \n\nSW, biomass ashes and limestone, total C was analysed by combustion with a Leco analyser. \n\nAt the beginning (one month of incubation) and end of assays (after one and three years of L. \n\npedunculata and C. ladanifer growth, respectively), composite samples of the GW and Technosols \n\nfrom each pot and corresponding to rhizosphere system were collected. A part of these samples were \n\nkept fresh (4 \u00baC) for determination of multielemental concentration in the available fraction, while the \n\nremaining subsamples were air-dried for classical characterization according methodologies referred \n\nabove. To determine the available fraction, elements were extracted from GW and Technosols \n\n(fraction &lt;2 mm) by the rhizosphere-based method, which uses an aqueous solution at 10 mM \n\nmixture of organic acids (acetic acid + lactic acid + citric acid + malic acid + formic acid; Feng et al., \n\n2005). Also, at the end of the experiment, materials from all the treatments were also collected, in \n\neach 5 cm of depth, and air-dried to determinate the total concentration of elements as to the initial \n\nmaterials.  \n\nAt the end of the experiment, roots and shoots (composed of leaves and twigs) of both plant \n\nspecies were collected. Plant samples were washed with tap water and then with distilled water. After \n\nwashing, the roots were sonicated in distilled water for 30 min. Plant samples were dried (40 \u00baC), \n\n\n\nCombined rehabilitation of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes by phytostabilisation with autochthones species using Technosols \n\n \n\n267 \n\n \n\nhomogenised and finely ground. Elements (except N) were extracted from plant and certified \n\nreference samples with ultrapure concentrated nitric acid (69 %) under pressure in a microwave \n\ndigester during 2 min at 85 \u00baC + 5 min at 145 \u00baC + 5 min at 200 \u00baC + 18 min at 200 \u00baC. Total \n\nconcentration of N was analysed by combustion with a Leco analyser.  \n\nThe aqueous solutions corresponding to the available fraction of GW and Technosols, and plant \n\nextracts were stored at \u201318 \u00baC until analysed for Al, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb and Zn by \n\nflame atomic absorption spectrometry and As by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. In \n\nplant extracts was still analyse P by visible spectrophotometry using the molybdenum blue method \n\n(USEPA, 1979). \n\n \n\nData analysis \n\n \n\nData were analysed by a one way ANOVA and the Duncan test (p &lt;0.05) used to separate means, \n\nusing the statistical programme SPSS v18.0 for Windows. For statistical purposes, the results below \n\nthe detection limit were assumed as half of the detection limit. Bivariate Pearson correlations were \n\nused to correlate GW or Technosols and plant characteristics (r > 0.90). Quality control of the \n\nanalyses was made by analytical replicate samples, use of certified standards solutions, reference \n\nbush branches and leaves samples (NCSDC73348) and blanks. The accuracy control of the total \n\nconcentration of the elements in GW and organic/inorganic wastes is guaranteed by the standards at \n\nthe international accredited laboratory (Actlabs, ISO/IEC 17025; Activation Laboratories). \n\nThree coefficients were calculated to evaluate the potential of both species for phytostabilisation \n\nwith Technosols (Abreu et al., 2012a; Perelman, 1966): Soil-plant transfer coefficient (TransferC = \n\n[total shoots element]/[total soil element]), translocation coefficient (TranslC = [total shoots \n\nelement]/[total roots element]), biological absorption coefficient (BAC = [total roots element]/[available \n\nsoil element]). Soil-plant transfer coefficient indicates the accumulation behaviour of an element by \n\nplant (accumulator plants: TransferC > 1; non-accumulator/excluder: TransferC &lt;1). The translocation \n\nof an element from roots to shoots is evaluated by the translocation coefficient, while uptake capacity \n\nwas assessed by biological absorption coefficient.

(2008) and P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al. (2008) to the same type of materials and also \n\nfrom S\u00e3o Domingos. Nonetheless, GW used in this study presented worse chemical characteristics \n\n(total concentrations of several hazardous elements, especially As and Pb, pH and fertility) than \n\nsimilar materials from other studies (de Varennes et al., 2010; Qu and de Varennes, 2010; Santos et \n\nal., 2012, 2013a, 2014b, 2015) and also collected in the same mine area. \n\nSulfide-rich wastes had very acidic pH values as well as poor fertility and large EC. This mine \n\nwaste also presented high total concentrations of several hazardous elements which were in the same \n\nrange as those reported by several authors (\u00c1lvarez-Valero et al., 2008; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2008; \n\nSantos et al., 2014c, 2015). With the exception of As and Pb, concentrations of the potentially \n\nhazardous elements in SW were higher than those in GW. \n\nAll the organic and inorganic wastes (AGW, AW, CW and RW) used in the amendment mixtures \n\nhad chemical characteristics considered favourable and safe for land application and rehabilitation of \n\nGW. Moreover, chemical characteristics of L and BA reflected great potential to provide a natural and \n\nalkaline barrier layer between the GW or Technosols and the SW, due to their buffer capacity. \n\n \n\nChemical characterisation of the Technosols from microcosm assays \n\n \n\nThe chemical characteristics of the materials from GW and Technosols in the two assays, with L. \n\npedunculata and C. ladanifer growth, are given in Table 3 and Figures 2 and 3. In general, \n\ncharacteristics of the GW were improved with the amendments application (Santos et al., 2014b) even \n\nduring longer periods of plant growth (three years of plant growth). Comparing Technosols, significant \n\ndifferences were obtained in some characteristics between application rates of the amendments but \n\nnot concerning to amendment mixture.  \n\nEven after only one month of incubation (beginning of the assay), it was observed an improvement \n\nof the Technosols structure, especially due to the incorporation of RW, which it remained until the end \n\nof the assays (data not shown). The incorporation of organic matter in the Technosols can also \n\npromote a favourable aggregation of particles and formation of granular structure (Zanuzzi et al., \n\n2009). Additionally, the organic matter of the amendments from Technosols is oxidized originating \n\nweak organic acids with some buffering capacity what can explain the significant increase of pH of \n\nmaterials (Table 3). As expected, they also increased EC, due to the increase of nutrient amounts in \n\nthe available fraction, but these values were still small compared to the application of other \n\namendments (e.g. sewage sludge, compost from the organic fraction of unsorted municipal solid \n\nwaste; Alvarenga et al., 2008a,b; Clemente et al., 2006). \n\nIn general, the amendments, independently of application rate and mixture, improved the fertility \n\nfrom contents very low to medium-high (INIA\u2013LQARS, 2000). Concentrations of organic C and \n\nextractable P and K in the Technosols were higher than in GW (Table 3). This increase of the organic \n\nmatter content contributed to the improvement of the water-holding capacity. The highest extractable \n\nK concentrations in GW at the end of the both assays are related to biomass ashes which, during the \n\nsampling, were slightly collected with GW. Thus, these results should not be considered as a real \n\n\n\nCombined rehabilitation of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes by phytostabilisation with autochthones species using Technosols \n\n \n\n270 \n\n \n\ndifference compared to Technosols. Still concerning to extractable K, the amendments provided \n\nsignificant amounts in the beginning of the assays but, during the growth of both species, this nutrient \n\nwas uptake by the plants. Technosols also had higher total N concentrations than GW (control) at \n\nbeginning and after one year of L. pedunculata growth (Table 3). However, after three years of C. \n\nladanifer growth, the highest total N concentration was obtained only in TB60. Taking into account that \n\nplants only grown in GW during approximately 40 days and the concentrations of NPK in Technosols \n\nwhere grown L. pedunculata, the results suggest that these elements remain for a significant long \n\nperiod in the Technosols and that their decrease at the end of C. ladanifer assay was possibly due to \n\ntheir uptake by plants. \n\nComparing the variations of C/N over time, the ratios for the Technosols suggest that until one year \n\nthe mineralization and decomposition of organic matter is being favoured. In fact, only after three \n\nyears of plants growth was observed a significant increase of organic C compared to the beginning \n\n(beginning = end of L. pedunculata assay but beginning &lt;end of C. ladanifer assay). In this period, \n\nC/N ratios were very high (> 50) indicating that the mineralization is being very slow. \n\nThe Technosols and growth of both species enhanced much more the fertility of materials, \n\ncompared to the application of hydrophilic polyacrylate polymers and growth of Spergularia purpurea \n\n(Pearson) G. Don fil. in soils developed on gossan (Santos et al., 2013a), but not the pH, which \n\nattained ?7. In soils developed on gossan, after application of compost and Dactylis glomerata L. \n\ngrowth, pH only reached the maximum value of 5.9 although initial pH of the materials was 4.8 (de \n\nVarennes et al., 2010). In Technosols with the same composition of TA30 and TA60 but using a \n\ndifferent GW and growing C. ladanifer for 15 months, the pH values were lower and fertility were quite \n\ndifferent (Santos et al., 2014b) compared to the results obtained in the present study. This variation \n\ncan be related to the heterogeneity of the organic and inorganic wastes used in the amendment \n\nmixture and the long experimental period (three years) of this study. It should be noticed that the GW \n\nused in the present study had much more extreme characteristics than similar materials referenced \n\nabove, consequently, the result can be considered better. \n\nThe elements concentrations in the available fraction of GW and Technosols where L. pedunculata \n\nand C. ladanifer were grown are given in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. Independently of treatment, \n\nassay and sampling, the available concentrations of Ni and V were below detection limit of apparatus \n\n(lesser than ?1 and ?10 mg/kg, respectively). \n\nIn all Technosols and samplings (Figs. 2 and 3), the concentration of hazardous elements (Al and \n\nAs) and nutrients (Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na and Zn) in the available fraction increased, while Cu and Pb \n\nwere reduced to values below the detection limit of the apparatus compared to the GW (mg/kg; Cu ? \n\nGW: 1.5?2.1, Technosols: &lt;1; Pb \u2013 GW: 10.0?15.6, Technosols: &lt;5 mg/kg). Similar tendency was \n\nobtained in amended GW and soils developed on GW whose total concentrations of some elements \n\nare quite different (de Varennes et al., 2010; Santos et al., 2013a; 2014b). With application of biosolids \n\nto copper mine tailings Santib\u00e1\u00f1ez et al. (2010) found higher concentration of Zn in the pore-water, as \n\nwell as an increase on Cu concentration. This last finding is not in agreement with the results obtained \n\nin the present study. In a soil from the area affected by the Aznalc\u00f3llar mine accident amended with \n\ndifferent wastes (alperujo, biosolid compost and sugar beet lime), the concentrations of Cu, Mn and Zn \n\n\n\nCombined rehabilitation of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes by phytostabilisation with autochthones species using Technosols \n\n \n\n271 \n\n \n\nin the available fraction (extracted with CaCl2) were, in general, reduced (Burgos et al., 2010), which \n\ncan be a disadvantage to the development of plants and other organisms.  \n\nTable 3 Characteristics of the gossan wastes and Technosols collected at the beginning (after one month of \n\nincubation) and end of the assays (after one and three years of Lavandula pedunculata and Cistus ladanifer \n\ngrowth, respectively) (mean \u00b1 SD; n = 4). \n\n Technosols \n\n GW TA30 TA60 TB30 TB60 \n\nBeginning for both assays \n\npH (H2O) 3.7 \u00b1 0.03\nc\n 5.8 \u00b1 0.3\n\na\n 5.8 \u00b1 0.2\n\na\n 5.0 \u00b1 0.1\n\nb\n 6.0 \u00b1 0.1\n\na\n \n\nEC (\u00b5S/cm) 137 \u00b1 21\nb\n 381 \u00b1 117\n\nab\n 749 \u00b1 413\n\na\n 432 \u00b1 170\n\nab\n 620 \u00b1 293\n\na\n \n\nCorganic (g/kg) 2.2 \u00b1 0.2\nd\n 8.5 \u00b1 1.9\n\nb\n 12.7 \u00b1 2.0\n\na\n 6.2 \u00b1 0.2\n\nc\n 9.0 \u00b1 1.7\n\nb\n \n\nNTotal (mg/kg) 125.8 \u00b1 10.2\nd\n 368.1 \u00b1 47.9\n\nb\n 489.7 \u00b1 143.9\n\na\n 252.1 \u00b1 61.4\n\nc\n 430.6 \u00b1 31.5\n\nab\n \n\nPExtractable \n\n(mg/kg) \n0.2 \u00b1 0.2\n\nd\n 42.5 \u00b1 22.0\n\nc\n 162.6 \u00b1 84.1\n\nb\n 35.9 \u00b1 19.8\n\nc\n 328.7 \u00b1 21.5\n\na\n \n\nKExtractable \n\n(mg/kg) \n16.9 \u00b1 0.5\n\nc\n 85.9 \u00b1 21.5\n\nbc\n 159.8 \u00b1 61.1\n\nb\n 139.1 \u00b1 20.8\n\nb\n 308.6 \u00b1 87.9\n\na\n \n\nEnd of the assay with Lavandula pedunculata \n\npH (H2O) 4.2 \u00b1 0.2\nc\n 6.0 \u00b1 0.3\n\na\n 5.9 \u00b1 0.2\n\nab\n 5.6 \u00b1 0.2\n\nb\n 6.0 \u00b1 0.1\n\na\n \n\nEC (\u00b5S/cm) 1003 \u00b1 659\na\n 226 \u00b1 147\n\nb\n 468 \u00b1 198\n\nb\n 285 \u00b1 156\n\nb\n 335 \u00b1 221\n\nb\n \n\nCorganic (g/kg) 3.1 \u00b1 1.3\nc\n 7.5 \u00b1 0.6\n\nb\n 10.9 \u00b1 1.1\n\na\n 6.8 \u00b1 1.2\n\nb\n 9.4 \u00b1 1.0\n\na\n \n\nNTotal (mg/kg) 118.6 \u00b1 10.8\nd\n 368.7 \u00b1 56.5\n\nb\n 514.1 \u00b1 65.3\n\na\n 287.7 \u00b1 34.8\n\nc\n 395.5 \u00b1 24.3\n\nb\n \n\nPExtractable \n\n(mg/kg) \n3.0 \u00b1 3.2\n\nc\n 149.3 \u00b1 16.0\n\nb\n 525.9 \u00b1 217.4\n\na\n 147.9 \u00b1 120.2\n\nb\n 515.8 \u00b1 166.2\n\na\n \n\nKExtractable \n\n(mg/kg) \n513.2 \u00b1 253.9\n\na\n 95.5 \u00b1 54.6\n\nb\n 202.6 \u00b1 43.4\n\nb\n 119.3 \u00b1 10.6\n\nb\n 219.8 \u00b1 87.5\n\nb\n \n\nEnd of the assay with Cistus ladanifer \n\npH (H2O) 4.0 \u00b1 0.2\nb\n 5.8 \u00b1 0.3\n\na\n 5.9 \u00b1 0.1\n\na\n 5.8 \u00b1 0.2\n\na\n 5.7 \u00b1 0.2\n\na\n \n\nEC (\u00b5S/cm) 1090 \u00b1 369\na\n 199 \u00b1 144\n\nb\n 268 \u00b1 70\n\nb\n 471 \u00b1 364\n\nb\n 102 \u00b1 23\n\nb\n \n\nCorganic (g/kg) 5.2 \u00b1 0.5\nc\n 15.2 \u00b1 1.1\n\nb\n 26.2 \u00b1 4.2\n\na\n 15.9 \u00b1 2.4\n\nb\n 22.6 \u00b1 4.6\n\na\n \n\nNTotal (mg/kg) 341.2 \u00b1 126.9\nab\n\n 388.2 \u00b1 75.5\nab\n\n 204.4 \u00b1 151.2\nb\n 234.5 \u00b1 104.2\n\nb\n 444.1 \u00b1 93.1\n\na\n \n\nPExtractable \n\n(mg/kg) \n0.9 \u00b1 0.5\n\nc\n 68.1 \u00b1 22.3\n\nb\n 176.8 \u00b1 100.5\n\na\n 79.6 \u00b1 25.0\n\nab\n 169.8 \u00b1 88.2\n\na\n \n\nKExtractable \n\n(mg/kg) \n474.3 \u00b1 41.7\n\na\n 76.8 \u00b1 12.2\n\nb\n 79.9 \u00b1 13.6\n\nb\n 63.9 \u00b1 16.5\n\nb\n 79.9 \u00b1 24.0\n\nb\n \n\nEC: electrical conductivity; GW: gossan wastes; TA30 and TA60: Technosols containing GW and AgW+AW+RW at 12 and 30 g/kg; \nTB30 and TB60: Technosols containing GW and AgW+CW+RW at 12 and 30 g/kg.

The \n\nmajority of the nutrients can also derived from organic matter, although statistically only moderate \n\ncorrelation was obtained (0.66 &lt;r &lt;0.80, depending on element, sampling and assay).  \n\nThe effect of organic matter in the mobilization or immobilization of the elements depends on their \n\ncharacteristics (Bolan et al., 2014). Santib\u00e1\u00f1ez et al. (2010) attributed the high availability of elements \n\nin amended substrates to the increase of dissolved organic C amounts released from organic \n\namendments decomposition. However, organic matter from Technosols can also have increased the \n\ncationic exchange capacity and promoted the formation of complexes with some cations (Adriano et \n\nal., 2004; Bolan et al., 2014; Kumpiene et al., 2008) justifying the reduction of Cu and Pb (GW: \n\n1.5?2.1 mg Cu/kg and 10?15.6 mg Pb/kg depending on assay and sampling) of more than 15 % and \n\n45 % respectively (although obtaining moderate correlations). Several authors (Alvarenga et al., \n\n2008a, 2008b; Burgos et al., 2010) ascribed the decrease on the Cu and/or Pb concentrations in the \n\navailable fraction of acid and metal-contaminated soils to the application of organic amendments (e.g. \n\nsewage sludge or biosolid compost) to these soils. Besides, pH can affect availability of Cu and Pb, \n\nhowever no strong relationship was obtained between pH and the available concentrations of these \n\nelements. This fact was also observed in other studies (Alvarenga et al., 2008a, 2008b; Burgos et al., \n\n2010; Santos et al., 2013a). \n\nThe increase of As can be related to the inhibition of the formation of some solid phases with low \n\nsolubility (e.g. metal arsenates) (Abreu et al., 2009; Santos et al., 2012). The increase of dissolved \n\norganic C in the rhizosphere due to exudation of low molecular weight organic acids by roots and/or \n\norganic wastes from amendment mixtures may also justify the increase of As availability in the \n\nTechnosols (Bolan et al., 2014; Feng et al., 2005; Kumpiene et al., 2008; Tu et al., 2004). In fact, \n\nsome root exudates or even specific low molecular-weight organic acids can release As from \n\narsenates (Tu et al., 2004) and metal oxi-hydroxides (Zhang et al., 2005). \n\nComparing the effect of the amendments on the GW to make the Technosols, no significant \n\ndifferences were obtained between available concentrations of K, Mg, Mn and Na according on \n\namendment mixture and application rate at beginning of the assays and the control, whereas the \n\nsame occurred for Al, K, Mg, Na and Zn at the end of the two assays. For the other elements and in all \n\nsampling periods, the application rate altered the concentrations of the elements in the available \n\nfraction having, in general, the highest amounts with application of 60 g/kg of amendments. \n\nExceptions were observed for Al, As, Fe and Zn in the beginning of the assay (after one month of \n\nincubation), where a combined effect can have occurred with the type and amount of the organic \n\nmatter because there is no clear trend in the application rate and amendment mixture. It should be \n\nfurther highlighted the variation of the available concentrations of As and Fe among Technosols \n\naccording to the species (and possibly duration of the assay).

However in the \n\nTechnosols, this tendency was only observed in some cases (e.g. Zn in both plants assays; Ca and \n\nFe in L. pedunculata assay). In fact, the amendments provided sufficient nutrients amounts to support \n\nthe plant growth (and all microbial community) and keep the stable concentrations over time. \n\nConcentrations of the potentially hazardous elements (Al and As) increased from the beginning till one \n\nyear, but after that showed a tendency to be constant (except As in TA30 and TA60 and Al in T60B). \n\nAlthough GW had large total concentrations of Al, As, and Pb, the amounts of these elements \n\npotentially available for the plants and microorganisms in the Technosols were lesser than 1 % of the \n\ntotal concentrations, which represent a small potential environmental risk. Nonetheless, the increase \n\nof organic C and nutrients availability and their permanence in the soil system during longer periods is \n\nan advantage for the rehabilitation process. \n\nIn general, no clear improvement of the chemical characteristics of Technosols was observed both \n\nwith amendment mixture and/or application rate. \n\n \n\nGermination and growth of Lavandula pedunculata and Cistus ladanifer \n\n \n\nGermination of both plant species was stimulated in the Technosols, compared to GW (Table 4). \n\nApproximately 40 days after sowing, seedlings of L. pedunculata (?4 cm height) and C. ladanifer (?3 \n\ncm height) growing in GW and without visible symptoms of nutritional deficiency or phytotoxicity died. \n\nThis fact is not in agreement with the results obtained by Santos et al. (2014b) in which C. ladanifer \n\nsurvived (with a very small development) for 505 days in a gossan waste also collected in S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos mine area but with better chemical characteristics than GW used in the present study. \n\nNonetheless, in a mesocosm assay with soils developed on gossan materials and considerable \n\nquantity of host rocks (i.e. also with less extreme conditions than the GW studied) was observed \n\ngermination of C. ladanifer in control but not of Lavandula sampaioana (Rozeira) Rivas Mart., T.E. \n\nD\u00edaz &amp; Fern. Gonz. But the mortality was also very high in both species (Santos et al., 2013a). The \n\nimprovement of the structure and water holding capacity, due to the amendments in the Technosols, \n\ncan explain the higher germination rate of both species in the present study. Moreover, these \n\nparameters of the materials combined with the increase of nutrients and organic C (Figs. 2 and 3, and \n\nTable 3) can justify the survival and great plant growth during all assays in the Technosols. \n\nTable 4 Effects of the treatments (gossan wastes and Technosols) on germination (%) of Lavandula pedunculata \n\nand Cistus ladanifer (mean \u00b1 SD; n = 4). \n\n  Technosols \n\nSpecies GW TA30 TA60 TB30 TB60 \n\nLavandula pedunculata 3 \u00b1 2\nb\n 15 \u00b1 9\n\na\n 18 \u00b1 10\n\na\n 17 \u00b1 9\n\na\n 16 \u00b1 9\n\na\n \n\nCistus ladanifer 1 \u00b1 1\nc\n 6 \u00b1 1\n\nb\n 11 \u00b1 5\n\na\n 6 \u00b1 2\n\nb\n 5 \u00b1 3\n\nb\n \n\nGW: gossan wastes (control); TA30 and TA60: Technosol containing GW and AgW+AW+RW at 30 and 60 g/kg; TB30 and \nTB60: Technosol containing GW and AgW+CW+RW at 30 and 60 g/kg; AgW: agriculture wastes; AW: residue from the liquor \ndistillation of A. unedo fruit; CW: residue from liquor distillation of C. siliqua fruit; RW: rockwool used for strawberry crops \nValues for each species followed by a different letter are significantly different (p &lt;0.05) \n\n\n\nCombined rehabilitation of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes by phytostabilisation with autochthones species using Technosols \n\n \n\n276 \n\n \n\nBiomass ashes from bottom of the Technosols can also supply several nutrients to the plants (Ram \n\nand Masto, 2010; Su and Wong, 2003) ensuring their growth for long periods. The fertility of the \n\nmaterials is considered the parameter with major importance for the success of phytostabilisation, \n\nespecially in the early stages of plant growth (Tordoff et al., 2000). However the success of \n\nphytostabilization of mine wastes, especially those located in areas with Mediterranean climate, \n\ndepends on a combined effect of several characteristics (e.g. hydric stress). \n\nThe growth stimulation of different herbaceous (e.g. D . glomerata, Lolium multiflorum Lam and \n\nLolium perenne L.) and shrubs (e.g. C. ladanifer and Erica australis L.) in microcosm assays under \n\ncontrolled conditions (Alvarenga et al., 2008a, 2008b; de Varennes et al., 2010; Qu and de Varennes, \n\n2010; Santib\u00e1\u00f1ez et al., 2008; Santos et al., 2013a, 2014b) as well as spontaneous vegetation in the \n\nfield (P\u00e9rez-de-Mora et al., 2011) in contaminated soils/mine wastes after different amendments \n\napplication is reported. None of the other characteristics of the Technosols (Figs. 2 and 3, and Table \n\n3) seem to affect negatively the plants growth. \n\nAlthough Technosols with high application rates of amendments had greater concentrations of \n\norganic C and nutrients (e.g. total N and extractable P; Table 3), no significant variation was observed \n\nin height and fresh shoots biomass of L. pedunculata (Table 5).

However, the concentrations of the elements in the roots \n\nad shoots depended on species (Fig. 4). The uptake (evaluated by the biological absorption \n\ncoefficient) was, mainly, strong for Al (L. pedunculata: 4?15; C. ladanifer: 0.3?6) and intensive for As \n\nand Pb (BACAs: 7?97; BACPb: 56?381, depending on species). After absorption, and, as a tolerance \n\nmechanism (Kabata-Pendias, 2011), these elements were stored in their roots (TranslC &lt;0.3). \n\nNo significant differences were obtained among the concentrations of Al in roots (849.3?1222.9 \n\nmg/kg) and As and Pb in shoots mg/kg; 5.6?10.7 and 17.4?27.2, respectively) of L. pedunculata from \n\ndifferent Technosols. The highest concentrations of As and Pb in roots of this species were reached in \n\nTA30 (130.1 mg As/kg and 459.4 mg Pb/kg) which were the double of the values determined in the \n\nplants from the other Technosols (55.5?72.4 mg As/kg and 229.7?279.9 mg Pb/kg, depending on \n\ntreatment). Slight variation of Al concentrations in shoots was observed, however L. pedunculata \n\ngrowing in Technosols with high amendments application rates showed a tendency to have higher \n\nvalues (mg/kg ? TA60: 153.4; TB60: 178.2; TA30: 99.1; TB30: 112.0). In C. ladanifer, the \n\nconcentrations of the studied potentially hazardous elements in roots and shoots were similar \n\nindependently of the Technosol where they grow. Despite of the variations in the elements \n\nconcentrations in the available fraction of the different Technosols (Figs. 2 and 3), no relationship was \n\nfound between this soil characteristic and the concentrations of the potentially hazardous elements in \n\nroots or shoots of both species. \n\nPhytotoxic concentrations of the elements in shoots were only reached and exceeded for As (5 \n\nmg/kg; Kabata-Pendias, 2011) for: L. pedunculata from all Technosols and C. ladanifer from \n\nTechnosols containing residue from liquor distillation of C. siliqua fruit (TB30 and TB60). However, no \n\nvisual symptoms of toxicity were observed in the two species. In L. pedunculata a possible synergism \n\neffect of Pb in shoots can explain these phytotoxic values of As (r = 0.99). Both species were non-\n\naccumulators of the studied hazardous elements. \n\nIn spite of the variability intra and inter-population of C. ladanifer growing in mine wastes and/or \n\nsoils developed on mine wastes in natural conditions (Santos et al., 2012, 2014a and references \n\ntherein), the plants obtained in this study, under controlled conditions, showed a similar behaviour on \n\nthe translocation and accumulation, being the elements concentrations in the same range than the \n\nfield.

The other nutrients \n\npresented intensive uptake (L. pedunculata: Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Na and Zn; C. ladanifer: Cu and K). \n\nPlant of both species showed some variability in the translocation behaviour of the nutrients even \n\ngrowing in same treatment, however a clear tendency can be indicated for each species (Figs. 5?8). \n\nVariation of the translocation behaviour of some elements can be observed in several species growing \n\nspontaneously in mining areas from IPB (Abreu et al., 2012a, 2012b; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2014; Santos \n\net al., 2012, 2014a). Both species translocated, mainly, from roots to shoots K, N and P (TranslC: \n\n0.5?4.5 depending on element, species and treatment) while Cu, Fe, Na and Ni were stored in the \n\nroots. Cistus ladanifer still translocated Ca, Mg and Zn but L. pedunculata stored these nutrients in \n\ntheir roots (TranslC ? L. pedunculata: 0.4?1.2; C. ladanifer: 1.0?13.4, depending on element and \n\ntreatment). The opposite occurred for Mn being stored in roots of C. ladanifer (TranslC: 0.3?1.8, \n\ndepending on treatment) but translocated in L. pedunculata (TranslC: 1.8?7.2, depending on \n\ntreatment). \n\nConcentrations of the nutrients in roots and shoots also varied with species (Figs. 5?8) being the \n\ncombined effect of the uptake, accumulation in roots, translocation from roots to shoots, a tolerance \n\ncapacity and, possibly, nutritional requirements. As for the available fraction of the elements (Figs. 2 \n\nand 3, and Table 3), no clear tendency was obtained among the plants from different Technosols. In \n\nfact, only in L. pedunculata shoots from Technosols containing 60 g/kg of amendments showed the \n\nhighest Mg concentrations (mg/kg ? TA60: 2.1; TB60: 1.9), compared to plants growing in a Technosol \n\nwith half of the amendment dose (?1.3 mg/kg). Moreover, independently of the Technosol, no \n\nsignificant differences were obtained among concentrations of Ca, Mn and Na in roots and shoots and \n\nCu, Fe, N, P and Zn in shoots of L. pedunculata. The same was observed in C. ladanifer for Ca, Cu in \n\nshoots, Na and Ni in roots and K, Mg, N, P and Zn in roots and shoots. No relationship was obtained \n\nbetween nutrients concentrations in roots or shoots of the two species and the respective available \n\nfractions of the elements in the Technosols. \n\nAlthough C. ladanifer had presented an effective uptake capacity of Cu and Mn, their storage in \n\nroots (or low translocation) can contribute, to some extent, to the deficient concentrations of these \n\nelements in the shoots. Thus, C. ladanifer shoots from all the Technosols presented deficient Cu \n\nconcentrations (&lt;5 mg/kg; Kabata-Pendias, 2011) but, only shoots from Technosols containing A. \n\nunedo residue had deficiency of Mn (&lt;30 mg/kg; Adriano, 2001; Kabata-Pendias, 2011).The great \n\ntranslocation of Mn in L. pedunculata from all the Technosols and Zn in plants from the Technosols at \n\n30 g/kg amendments application can explain the concentrations of these elements in the shoots, \n\nwhich are considered phytotoxic or above the normal/sufficient (> 400 mg Mn/kg and > 150 mg Zn/kg; \n\nKabata-Pendias, 2011). None synergism or antagonism effect between elements was statistically \n\nobtained, allowing to explain these anomalous concentrations in shoots of both species. Moreover, in \n\nany case, the plants did not show visual symptoms of deficiency or toxicity indicated by several \n\nauthors (Adriano, 2001; Kabata-Pendias, 2011). Concentrations of the remaining nutrients in the \n\nshoots of the two species reached values considered normal/sufficient and/or below the phytotoxicity \n\nfor the majority of the plant species (Adriano, 2001; Kabata-Pendias, 2011). In C. ladanifer a possible \n\nsynergism effect of As in shoots can occur with Fe (r = 0.91). \n\n\n\nCombined rehabilitation of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes by phytostabilisation with autochthones species using Technosols \n\n280 \n\n \n\na\n\na\n\na\n\nab\n\nb b\nb\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\nC\na\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n)\nRoots Shoots\n\nb\nb\n\na\n\nb\n\nb\nb\n\nab\n\na\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nK\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n)\n\nb\n\nab\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nb\n\nc\n\nb\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\nTA30 TA60 TB30 TB60\n\nM\ng\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n)\n\nTreatments\n\nab\n\na\n\nab\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nTA30 TA60 TB30 TB60\n\nN\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n)\n\nTreatments\n\nab\n\na\n\nb\n\nab\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\nTA30 TA60 TB30 TB60\n\nP\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n)\n\nTreatments\n \n\n \n\nFig. 5 Effects of the Technosols on the concentration of macronutrients in the roots and shoots of Lavandula pedunculata.

Exception was obtained for Na in L. pedunculata, which presented accumulation \n\nbehaviour in all the Technosols (TransferC: 0.6?1.8), while C. ladanifer was non-accumulator of Na \n\n(TransferC &lt;0.9). \n\nVariability intra and inter-population of ecological behaviours and/or elements concentrations in the \n\ntwo studied species growing spontaneously in mining areas are reported by several authors (de la \n\nFuente et al., 2010; Freitas et al., 2004b; Santos et al., 2012, 2014a and references therein). \n\nDifferences in the concentrations of some nutrients obtained in this study can related to seasonal and \n\ntemporal variations in plants and the analysed plant part. The lower nutrients concentrations in plants \n\ngrowing in the Technosols, compared to plants from the field, can be attributed to the high availability \n\nof nutrients in the substrata. \n\n \n\nEfficiency of the combined rehabilitation system \n\n \n\nThe Technosols studied ensure the germination and good vegetative development of the species, \n\nC. ladaniferand L. pedunculata. Biomass ashes from the barrier located in the bottom of the \n\nTechnosols can supply some macro- and micronutrients (Table 2) to the plants and minimize their \n\ndrought stress due to its significant water holding capacity (Ram and Masto, 2010). The plants did not \n\nshow visual signs of phytotoxicity and/or deficiency of any elements, independently of the Technosols \n\nwhere grown. \n\nThe species studied had sustainable characteristics/behaviours (high uptake of potentially \n\nhazardous elements, indicated by BAC; storage of hazardous elements in the roots, indicated by \n\nTranslC; non-accumulator behaviour of potentially hazardous elements, indicated by TransfC; good \n\nground cover; perennial; deeply root system), to their use in phytostabilisation programs of mine \n\nwastes. All these characteristics are reported by Mendez and Maier (2008) as the main requirements \n\nfor a sustainable phytoremediation program. The referred behaviours of the studied plants were \n\nsimilar to those of the same species growing in natural conditions. Additionally, elements \n\nconcentrations obtained in the shoots from plants growing in the Technosols (Figs. 4?8) were under \n\nthe metal toxicity limits for domestic animals (NCR, 2005) that, occasionally, stay in S\u00e3o Domingos \n\nmining area (cattle and sheep). So, the implementation of a phytostabilisation program with the \n\nstudied Technosols and the cultivation of both plant species do not pose any environmental risk. \n\nPhytostabilisation programs have low costs of installation and maintenance. Although the available \n\nfractions of the majority of the nutrients were not different among Technosols, the application of the \n\nhigh amendments dose to the GW highly improved some of its chemical characteristics, as is the case \n\nof: concentration of organic C; extractable P; Mn in L. pedunculata assay and Ca in C. ladanifer assay \n\n(Figs. 2 and 3, and Table 3). Thus, the conception of a Technosol with the high amendments dose can \n\nreflect a significant difference in the economic cost of the phytostabilisation process, even only \n\nconsidering the transportation of organic/inorganic wastes. Nonetheless the present study, as well as \n\nothers done with same species and similar mine wastes (Santos et al., 2014b, 2015), showed that the \n\nTechnosols containing more amounts of amendments mixture can guarantee the sustainability of the \n\n\n\nCombined rehabilitation of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes by phytostabilisation with autochthones species using Technosols \n\n \n\n285 \n\n \n\nrehabilitation process during longer periods. Additionally, the improvement of the fertility was sufficient \n\nto increase the growth of the two studied species which have a significant economic value to cosmetic \n\nand pharmaceutical (Barraj\u00f3n-Catal\u00e1n et al., 2010; Cavanagh and Wilkinson, 2002) as well as other \n\nindustrial purposes like cleaning products or pellets. Therefore, the increase of the shoots biomass \n\nproduction can contribute to a greater economic income and, consequently, the recovery of the \n\nrehabilitation cost. It is essential the assessment of the public safety risk of these products derived \n\nfrom contaminated areas. \n\nThe usual rehabilitation strategy of tailings, especially those composed of reactive minerals like \n\nsulfides, involves the covering. According to Santos et al. (2014c, 2015), the maintenance of moist SW \n\nfrom S\u00e3o Domingos mine generates very acidic aqueous leachates containing several elements, \n\nwhich ascend to the surface by capillarity during the hot periods and then originates several crystals, \n\nwhich can be more or less readily dissolved after wetting. The barrier between the sulfide wastes (SW) \n\nand the Technosols, composed of limestone and biomass ashes, which was tested in this study, \n\nneutralized the acidic solutions and provided an efficient alternative in the SW coverage and, \n\nconsequently, reduction of its oxidation. The absence of salt efflorescences on the surface of the \n\nmaterials (GW or Technosols) and maintenance of pH values in biomass ashes and surface materials \n\n(Table 6) confirm the absence of this process.  \n\nIn general, precipitation of secondary solid phases on the surface of limestone can form a coating \n\nthat limit or avoid the interaction with the adjacent aqueous solution (P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2007; Santos \n\net al., 2014c). However, in the present study the combined use of limestone and the biomass ashes \n\nseems to extend the efficiency of the alkalinity potential of the barrier, especially of the limestone. This \n\nbarrier still contributed to buffer SW materials even for three years due to, possibly, eluviation of small \n\nparticles of biomass ashes and lixiviation of carbonates, especially, from limestone and biomass \n\nashes. In fact, pH values of SW located below the barrier were more than twice (Control: 3.8; TA30: \n\n4.7; TA60: 3.7; TB30: 4.6; TB60: 3.5) the initial value of SW (Table 2). Laboratory experiments \n\nconducted by P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al. (2009) show that the microencapsulation of pyrite-rich sludge by \n\nformation of Fe-coatings, due to fly ashes effect, inhibited sulfide oxidation.  \n\nBoth materials from the barrier also lead to the retention of Al, As, Cu, Fe, Na, Pb, S and Zn \n\nresulting in the significant increase of their concentrations (Table 6) compared to the initial values \n\n(Table 2). Precipitation as metal-oxyhydroxides and/or carbonates, as a result of the increase of pH, \n\ncan be the main mechanism of immobilisation of those elements when acidic aqueous solutions \n\nascend from SW. In fact, several authors stated that amending contaminated wastes with liming \n\nmaterials and fly ashes reduce the availability of several elements (Bolan et al., 2014; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et \n\nal., 2007; Ram and Masto, 2010; Su and Wong, 2003). Additional advantage of biomass ashes in the \n\nsystem is the formation of Fe-oxyhydroxides as a result of ash-aqueous solutions interactions (Ram \n\nand Masto, 2010), which are important components for absorption and fixation of some elements, \n\nnamely As (Bolan et al., 2014; Kabata-Pendias, 2011; Kumpiene et al., 2008). At end of one and three \n\nyears, it was not observed any hardpan formation in the contact zone between the barrier and SW as \n\ndescribed by P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al. (2007) in a column assay where a top layer of fly ashes covers pyritic \n\nsludge.\n\n\n\nCombined rehabilitation of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes by phytostabilisation with autochthones species using Technosols \n\n286 \n\n \n\nTable 6 Total concentration of the elements and pH in the materials from different layers collected at the end of the assay (three years) with Cistus ladanifer. \n\n \npH \n\ng/kg \n\n Al As Ca Cu Fe K Mg Mn Na Ni P Pb S V Zn \n\nGossan wastes (Control) \n\nGW(0-5cm) 4.1 9.5 8.80 1.0 0.18 208 2.1 0.2 0.04 0.6 8 x 10\n-3\n\n 0.30 28.80 7.0 0.05 0.10 \n\nGW(5-10cm) 4.2 11.2 9.01 0.3 0.18 232 2.2 0.2 0.03 0.6 5 x 10\n-3\n\n 0.34 29.20 6.9 0.05 0.08 \n\nGW(15-20cm) 7.3 10.4 8.90 1.3 0.18 226 2.0 0.2 0.05 0.4 9 x 10\n-3\n\n 0.33 26.90 6.4 0.06 0.09 \n\nBA 8.4 29.6 1.30 120 0.18 48.3 11.4 9.5 1.87 3.0 0.07 2.75 3.89 7.0 0.07 0.29 \n\nL \u2014 5.7 0.08 331 0.20 6.6 1.6 2.9 0.08 0.2 0.01 0.04 4.37 11.1 9 x 10\n-3\n\n 0.18 \n\nTA60 \n\nTA60(0-5cm) 5.9 8.2 8.38 3.1 0.16 208 1.7 0.7 0.08 0.8 9 x 10\n-3\n\n 0.59 25.60 5.9 0.06 0.10 \n\nTA60(5-10cm) 5.8 11 8.85 2.8 0.17 224 2.0 0.7 0.08 0.7 9 x 10\n-3\n\n 0.70 27.00 6.3 0.06 0.10 \n\nTA60(15-20cm) 7.8 12.3 9.50 6.4 0.18 204 2.3 0.9 0.12 0.7 0.01 0.73 30.90 7.5 0.06 0.15 \n\nBA 8.1 33.6 0.39 131 0.39 29 12.7 9.8 2.17 3.5 0.09 2.75 1.07 4.4 0.07 0.46 \n\nL \u2014 8.0 0.08 308 0.20 8.9 2.1 2.8 0.07 0.2 7 x 10\n-3\n\n 0.07 3.17 13.0 0.01 0.13 \n\nTB30 \n\nTB30(0-5cm) 5.7 7.9 8.34 2.4 0.15 213 1.5 0.4 0.06 0.4 6 x 10\n-3\n\n 0.77 25.60 5.6 0.05 0.08 \n\nTB30(5-10cm) 5.7 11.1 8.95 1.9 0.17 234 1.9 0.6 0.06 1.0 9 x 10\n-3\n\n 0.51 26.60 6.0 0.06 0.09 \n\nTB30(15-20cm) 8.1 11.4 8.28 5.7 0.17 210 2.2 0.7 0.11 0.9 0.01 0.59 25.50 5.9 0.06 0.09 \n\nBA 8.5 32.9 0.53 127 0.21 30.4 10.6 10.3 2.06 3.0 0.08 2.56 1.54 1.9 0.07 0.27 \n\nL \u2014 5.8 0.05 323 0.12 4.7 1.3 3.0 0.08 0.2 8 x 10\n-3\n\n 0.04 4.14 5.4 8 x 10\n-3\n\n 0.08 \n\nBA: Biomass ashes; L: Limestone; TA60: Technosol containing GW and AgW+AW+RW at 60 g/kg; TB30: Technosol containing GW and AgW+CW+RW at 30 g/kg; GW: gossan wastes; AgW: \nagriculture wastes; AW: residue from the liquor distillation of A. unedo fruit; CW: residue from liquor distillation of C. siliqua fruit; RW: rockwool used for strawberry crops \n\n \n\n\n\nCombined rehabilitation of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes by phytostabilisation with autochthones species using Technosols \n\n287 \n\n \n\nThe tested composed barrier has the advantage of being porous, allowing the rainwater leaching \n\nand reducing the flow along the barrier. Biomass ashes had also a significant moisture retention and \n\nwater-holding capacity (Ram and Masto, 2010) reducing the leaching to deeper layers and, \n\nconsequently, sulfides oxidation. This fact can still be improved by the plant development in the \n\nTechnosols covering the barrier and forming the top layer of the entire system, which increases the \n\nevapotranspiration decreasing the water infiltration (Tordoff et al., 2000). Indeed, SW layer in control \n\ntreatment (GW without plant due to plant death) was moister than those in treatments with Technosols \n\nand plant growth (data not shown). \n\n \n\nCONCLUSION \n\n \n\nThe system of combined rehabilitation of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes was efficient and \n\nsustainable for long-term. The study demonstrated that the components of the barrier (limestone + \n\nbiomass ashes) stabilise the sulfide wastes decreasing/preventing their oxidation and the ascension of \n\nthe acid solutions rich in elements. Moreover this system allowed the rehabilitation of the sulfide rich \n\nwastes, which are not naturally colonized by vegetation, decreasing their erosion and generation of \n\nacid drainage. However, the top layer of gossan wastes without amendments addition (control) was \n\nnot adequate to support the plants growth. The conception of Technosols is crucial to the \n\nimplementation of the phytostabilisation programs in gossan wastes. In fact, Technosols made with \n\ngossan and agro-industrial wastes improved the chemical characteristics of the materials allowing the \n\ngermination and establishment of Cistus ladanifer and Lavandula pedunculata. These plant species \n\npresented good development and ecological behaviours (uptake, translocation and accumulation) \n\nadequate to their use in this rehabilitation system. Co-cropping of the two plant species with \n\ncontrasting nutritional abilities could improve phytostabilisation efficiency. The high biomass yields of \n\nboth species can contribute with economic income due to their potential use in several industries. \n\nAssessment and monitoring should be made in order to ensure that toxic substances are not \n\ntransferred to the plant-based products. Next step should be the implementation of the system in the \n\nfield in order to confirm their efficacy under Mediterranean climate conditions. \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors would like to thank Madre Fruta (Hubel Group) for providing the \n\nagriculture wastes and rockwool and Mr. Jos\u00e9 G.

EVALUATION OF CHEMICAL PARAMETERS AND \n\nECOTOXICITY OF A SOIL DEVELOPED ON GOSSAN \n\nFOLLOWING APPLICATION OF POLYACRYLATES \n\nAND GROWTH OF SPERGULARIA PURPUREA \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nEvaluation of chemical parameters and ecotoxicity of a soil developed on gossan following application of polyacrylates and \ngrowth of Spergularia purpurea \n\n295 \n\n \n\nABSTRACT  \n\n \n\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the chemical characteristics and ecotoxicity of a mine soil \n\ndeveloped on gossan materials and amended with hydrophilic polyacrylate polymers after a growth \n\ncycle of Spergularia purpurea. Different acute bioassays (Daphnia magna immobilization; microalgae \n\ngrowth inhibition; germination and growth of lettuce and oat) were carried out with simulated \n\nleachates, pore water and soil samples. The germination and growth of native shrubs (Cistus ladanifer \n\nand Lavandula sampaioana were also evaluated in the lysimeters where S. purpurea had grown. \n\nThe soil had high total concentrations (g/kg) of Al (3.50\u20138.60), As (2.55\u20132.73), Cu (0.13\u20130.91) and Pb \n\n(4.48\u20136.16). However, the percentages of elements in aqueous extracts (simulating leachates, pore \n\nwater, and the conditions of the rhizosphere soil) were small when compared to their total soil \n\nconcentrations (less than 9 % except for Na in leachates). Growth of S. purpurea and other natural \n\ncolonization of plant species (Poaceae, Fabaceae and Asteraceae families) improved chemical \n\ncharacteristics but the application of the polyacrylate polymers contributed to a further improvement of \n\nsoil quality. However, this was not sufficient to ensure the growth of a large number of shrubs despite \n\na great germination rate. \n\nAmong the several species used on the ecotoxicological assessment, the D. magna test was the only \n\nbioassay that showed a clear toxicity of soil leachates, suggesting the importance of using several \n\necotoxicological tests to assess the environmental risk of soil contamination and its rehabilitation. \n\nAlthough the studied soil can be considered contaminated taking into account the total soil \n\nconcentrations of Al, As, Cu and Pb, the low concentrations of the same chemical elements in \n\nextractable solutions, that simulated the fractions really available for organisms, did not demonstrate a \n\nsubstantial toxic effects in the organisms and, consequently, negative impact on the environment. \n\n \n\nKEYWORDS S\u00e3o Domingos mine \u2022 Bioassays \u2022 Leachates \u2022 Pore water \u2022 Rizosphere solution \n\n \n\n\n\nEvaluation of chemical parameters and ecotoxicity of a soil developed on gossan following application of polyacrylates and \ngrowth of Spergularia purpurea \n\n296 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBaseado no artigo publicado: Erika S.

S\u00e3o Domingos is \n\nan abandoned copper mine located in the Portuguese part of the IPB (SE of Portugal) that is said to \n\npresent a high environmental risk (Matos and Martins, 2006). Weathering of the sulfides-rich \n\nmineralization was responsible for the generation of a significant gossan, which was intensely \n\nexploited in Roman times. Modern exploitation (middle of the XIX century until 1960) occurred in both \n\ngossan and massive sulfides containing As, Cu, Pb and Zn (Quental et al., 2002). The mining wastes \n\ngenerated, over the long period of extraction and transformation of the ore, represent an important \n\nsource of acidity and of several trace elements with the consequent contamination of adjacent areas, \n\nincluding superficial waters and soils/sediments/host rocks (Abreu et al., 2010; \u00c1lvarez-Valero et al., \n\n2008). \n\nA large amount of organic and inorganic wastes are produced daily and disposed of in landfills, \n\nalthough several wastes can be used for the rehabilitation of degraded and contaminated areas, due \n\nto their chemical composition, provided they are available in sufficient amounts and close to the target \n\narea (Mac\u00edas, 2004). \n\nLarge quantities of hygiene products (diapers, paper towels, feminine products) containing \n\npolyacrylate polymers are used and they occupy a large volume in landfills. However, this type of \n\nwastes was shown to increase the growth of grasses and enhance some soil enzymatic activities (Al-\n\nHumaid and Moftah, 2007; Boatright et al., 1997; de Varennes et al., 1999; Guiwei et al., 2008; Qu \n\nand de Varennes, 2010). Moreover, due to the increase of the water-holding capacity of the soil, the \n\nuse of these polymers can be especially useful in soils in the Mediterranean region as the risk of \n\ndrought is high and periods without rain are frequent (Silberbush et al., 1993). \n\nTotal soil concentrations of chemical elements are used as guidelines to establish whether a soil \n\nshould be considered as contaminated, although only the elements in soil solution and/or \n\nexchangeable positions associated with inorganic and organic colloids are bioavailable (Adriano, \n\n2001; Kabata-Pendias, 2011). Thus, in remediation processes it is important to determine the \n\nconcentrations of chemical elements in soil leachates and available fractions (extracted with several \n\naqueous solutions: buffered and unbuffered salt solutions, acid solutions, chelating agents, etc.; \n\nKabata-Pendias, 2004). The evaluation of ecotoxicological effects of the application of amendments \n\nshould also be carried out, as chemical analysis per se is insufficient to evaluate potential ecological \n\nrisks (van Gestel et al., 2001). \n\nAny strategy to assess the potential risk of a soil should include tests with organisms of different \n\ntrophic levels, from the terrestrial and aquatic compartments (Bagur-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2011; Garc\u00eda-\n\nLorenzo et al., 2009; Knoke et al., 1999). Bioassays with vascular plants offer a variety of advantages \n\nto evaluate soil toxicity, allowing the assessment of a large array of parameters that can be affected by \n\nhazardous elements (Ferrari et al., 1999; van Gestel et al., 2001). Bioassays using aquatic organisms \n\nhave been used to evaluate the ecotoxicity in several ecosystems (Cerejeira et al., 1998; Pereira et \n\nal., 2000; Silva et al., 2012) even in mining areas from IPB (Alvarenga et al., 2012, 2008; Rocha et al., \n\n2011). \n\n\n\nEvaluation of chemical parameters and ecotoxicity of a soil developed on gossan following application of polyacrylates and \ngrowth of Spergularia purpurea \n\n298 \n\n \n\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the chemical characteristics and ecotoxicity of a soil \n\ndeveloped on gossan materials after amendment with hydrophilic polyacrylate polymers and growth of \n\nSpergularia purpurea (Pearson) G. Don fil..The natural colonization by herbaceous species and, \n\ngermination and development of native shrub species (Cistus ladanifer L. and Lavandula sampaiona \n\n(Rozeira) Rivas Mart., T.E. D\u00edaz &amp; Fern.Gonz.) were also evaluated to better understand the post-\n\nrehabilitation period. \n\n \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n\nSampling area \n\n \n\nThe sampling area was located within the S\u00e3o Domingos mining area, to the north of the open pit \n\n(37\u00ba40\u2019N, 70\u00ba30\u2019W), where soils were developed on gossan materials and host rocks (Spolic \n\nTechnosol Toxic; IUSS Working Group WRB, 2007). The vegetation present on the site included \n\nCistus ladanifer, Cistus salviifolius L., Lavandula luisieri (Rozeira) Rivas-Mart?nez, Lavandula \n\nsampaioana, Erica australis L. and many herbaceous species. About 1000 kg of the top soil (0\u201320 cm) \n\nwas collected in 2009 to be used in a mesocosm experiment. The soil was sandy and about 52 % \n\nconsisted of host rock fragments coarser than 2 mm.  \n\n \n\nMesocosm experiment \n\n \n\nThe experiment was performed in lysimeters (50 cm long with a diameter of 60 cm) with unsieved \n\nmine soil in four treatments (three replicates each): (1) control without polymer; (2) soil amended with \n\n25 diapers cut into 5 cm pieces and incorporated into the top 25 cm of the soil (about 0.3 % m/m of \n\npolyacrylate polymer); (3) soil amended with the polyacrylate polymer removed from 25 diapers; and \n\n(4) soil amended with a polyacrylate polymer synthesized by Marion Roussel Ltd (polymer 7015) \n\napplied at the same rate as before. The preparation of the mesocosm experiment and the \n\nestablishment of an indigenous grass (Spergularia purpurea) from the S\u00e3o Domingos area are \n\ndescribed in detail by Qu and de Varennes (2010). Briefly, 2 L of synthetic urine was added to each \n\nlysimeter and, after two weeks of incubation, 10 L of deionized water per week was added during one \n\nmonth to simulate rainfall. After growth of S. purpurea (from April until early June 2009), the soil was \n\nleft bare during the summer and then used for the present experiment. \n\nComposite soils samples from the 0\u20137 cm layer were collected from each lysimeter (nine \n\nsubsamples per lysimeter). Seeds of C. ladanifer (after a pre-treatment at 100 \u00baC for 30 minutes; \n\nCorral et al., 1990), and L. sampaioana, collected in the S\u00e3o Domingos mine in 2009, were sown (0.5 \n\ng of each species per lysimeter) in the lysimeters (October of 2009) immediately after soil sampling. \n\nGermination and growth of both shrubs were monitored over a 10 months period. Spontaneous \n\nspecies were also identified and their total fresh biomass evaluated at the end of the experiment. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nEvaluation of chemical parameters and ecotoxicity of a soil developed on gossan following application of polyacrylates and \ngrowth of Spergularia purpurea \n\n299 \n\n \n\nSoil characterization \n\n \n\nInitial soil, collected in the mine, and soil samples from each treatment were air-dried, \n\nhomogenized and sieved. The soil fraction with particles less than 2 mm was characterized for \n\n(P\u00f3voas and Barral, 1992): pH and electric conductivity (EC) in a water suspension (1:2.5 m/V); \n\nextractable K and P (Egner-Riehm method); total N (Kjeldahl method) and organic C by wet \n\ncombustion. Nitric and ammoniacal N (Mulvaney, 1996) and Fe from total iron oxides (Tamm reagent \n\nwith UV radiation; de Endredy, 1963) and from non-crystalline iron oxides (Tamm reagent in the dark; \n\nSchwertmann, 1964) were also determined. \n\nTotal concentrations of Al, As, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, S, Pb, Zn from initial soil (fraction &lt;2 \n\nmm) were determined using ICP-OES and INAA, after acid digestion (perchloric acid + nitric acid + \n\nhydrochloric acid + hydrofluoric acid) in an international certified laboratory (Actlabs, ISO/IEC 17025, \n\nActivation Laboratories, 2012). The same chemical elements were analysed in three aqueous \n\nextractable solutions that simulated: leachates, the soil solution in the pore water, and the solution \n\nfrom rizosphere soil (RHIZO solution). \n\nThe leachates and pore waters were obtained at room temperature in a rotatory shaker in a solid-\n\nto-water ratio of 1:10 (m/V) during 24 h and five days (aerated daily), respectively (DIN 38414-S4, \n\n1984; Buj\u00e1n et al., 2010). Then, these extractable solutions were filtrated under vacuum (&lt;0.45 \u00b5m), \n\nand the pH and EC were measured. The RHIZO solution was extracted with an aqueous diluted \n\nsolution containing a mixture of organic acids (acetic acid + lactic acid + citric acid + malic acid + \n\nformic acid) after 16 h of agitation (Rhizosphere-based method, Feng et al., 2005). The filtrates were \n\nstored at \u201318 \u00baC until analysis for Al, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Pb and Zn by flame atomic absorption \n\nspectrometry; As by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry; chlorides, nitrates and sulfates \n\nby ion chromatography; and phosphates by visible spectrophotometry by the molybdenum blue \n\nmethod (USEPA, 1979). \n\n \n\nBioassays \n\n \n\nEcotoxicological evaluation of the leachates (indirect bioassays) was performed using two plant \n\nspecies (dicot \u2013 Lactuca sativa L. var. crispa L. cv. Great Lakes 118, and monocot \u2013 Avena sativa L. \n\ncv. Santa Eul\u00e1lia), a microalgae (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (Korshikov) Hindak) and a \n\nmicrocrustacean (Daphnia magna Straus). These bioassays evaluated the toxicity risk of the soil to \n\nadjacent areas by acting as a source of contamination (van Gestel et al., 2001). The same \n\necotoxicological tests were carried out on the soil with the same plant species to evaluate the soil \n\nmatrix effect (direct bioassay). \n\n \n\nPlants \n\n \n\nToxicity towards plants was assessed in accordance with the OECD Guideline 208 (OECD 208, \n\n2006) by evaluating the effects on visual aspects, germination, root and shoot elongation and fresh \n\n\n\nEvaluation of chemical parameters and ecotoxicity of a soil developed on gossan following application of polyacrylates and \ngrowth of Spergularia purpurea \n\n300 \n\n \n\nbiomass of both plant species, following the exposure of the seeds and seedlings to moistened soil or \n\nleachates. Three bioassays were carried out: a filter paper test, a soil test and a hydroponic test. The \n\nseeds used were surface-sterilized in 10 % Na-hypochlorite solution for 20 min to prevent fungal \n\ngrowth and then washed with distilled water (Salvatore et al., 2008). \n\nIn one plant bioassay, three layers of filter paper (140 mm Watman No. 1 filter) were put on the \n\nbottom of glass beakers (100 mL) and moistened with 5 mL of leachate from each treatment (Filter \n\npaper test; Salvatore et al., 2008). Deionised water was used as the negative control. In a second \n\nbioassay, 15 g of the soil samples (fraction &lt;2 mm) were put in each glass beaker (Soil test; Mart\u00ed et \n\nal., 2007). \n\nSeven seeds of lettuce and five seeds of oat per replicate were placed in each beaker and then \n\nincubated in a growth chamber under controlled conditions (25 \u00b1 1 \u00baC; 16 h light/ 8 h darkness). The \n\nfilters and soils were kept moist and the germinated seeds were periodically counted during 15 days. \n\nThe criterion of germination was the emergence of a radicle through the seed coat. Length of roots \n\nand shoots and fresh biomass were measured at the end of the experiment. \n\nIn a third bioassay (hydroponic test), lettuce and oat seeds were germinated in the dark at 25 \u00baC for \n\n7 days and seedlings with a seminal root length of 50\u201380 mm and 15 mm respectively, (shoot length \n\nof 2\u20134 mm for lettuce and 30\u201350 mm for oat) were selected. Seedlings (seven of lettuce and five of \n\noat in each replicate) were grown in beakers filled with 50 mL of leachates from the different \n\ntreatments. The seedlings were supported by a thin and flexible plastic net placed on the top of each \n\nbeaker, so that only the roots were immersed in the leachate. After 15 days of growth in the same \n\nconditions as before, the biological parameters described above were evaluated. \n\n \n\nMicroalgae and microcrustacean \n\n \n\nMicroalgae toxicity was assessed by measuring the growth inhibition of P. subcapitata exposed to \n\nleachates (100 % of concentration V/V) for 72 h, according to the AlgalToxKit FTM test procedure \n\n(MicroBioTests, 2004) that follows the OECD guideline 201 (OCDE, 1984). The microalgae was \n\navailable as immobilized algal beads and 1 h prior to the test a concentrated algal inoculum of 1 x 106 \n\nalgae/mL was prepared by de-immobilization of the algal beads by adding \u201cMatrix dissolving Medium\u201d \n\nand shaking vigorously every 2 min till complete dissolution. The test was performed using three \n\nreplicates of all leachates on disposable 10 cm-long spectrophotometer cells (25 mL). At the end of \n\nthe test, the total growth inhibition percentage was determined by converting optical densities \n\n(spectrophotometer with a 670 nm filter) into algal numbers using an exponential model. The \n\nmicroalgae test data analysis was performed through the determination of the average specific growth \n\nrate for each treatment followed by the calculation of the percentage inhibition (% I) for each test batch \n\naccording to internationally accepted procedures (ISO 8692, 2004). \n\nThe microcrustacean acute toxicity was determined by the immobilisation of D. magna exposed to \n\nleachates for 48 h according to the bioassay procedure (MicroBio-Tests, 2000). The test organisms \n\nwere hatched for 72 h at 20\u201322 \u00baC under continuous illumination of 6000 lux prior to the test \n\nperformance from \u201cdormant eggs (ephippia)\u201d. At the beginning of the test, the young Daphnids \n\n\n\nEvaluation of chemical parameters and ecotoxicity of a soil developed on gossan following application of polyacrylates and \ngrowth of Spergularia purpurea \n\n301 \n\n \n\n(neonates) were less than 24 h old. As for the microalgae test, all leachates from the mesocosm \n\nexperiment were evaluated for their percentage of total effect using four replicates. At the end of the \n\ntest, the immobilization percentages were calculated according to ISO 6341 (1996). \n\n \n\nData analysis \n\n \n\nData were analysed by a one way ANOVA and the Tukey test (p &lt;0.05) used to separate means, \n\nusing the statistical programme SPSS v18.0 for Windows. For statistical purposes, the results below \n\nthe detection limit were assumed as half of the detection limit. Bivariate Pearson correlations were \n\nused to correlate the soil and plant characteristics (r > 0.80). Quality control of the analysis was made \n\nby analytical replicate samples, use of certified standards solution and laboratory standards at the \n\nActivation Laboratories. All the analyses were performed in triplicate, except the total concentration of \n\nthe chemical elements in initial soil which was done in duplicate. \n\nThe data from the bioassays using the leachates, the filter paper and both plant species were used \n\nto calculate two toxicity indexes reported by Bagur-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2011). The indexes can vary from \n\n?1 (maximum phytotoxicity) to > 0. \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nSoil characterization \n\n \n\nInitial soil from the S\u00e3o Domingos mine (before the mesocosm experiment) had chemical \n\ncharacteristics (Table 1) that are explained by the source materials and that can be considered as \n\nmoderately extreme when compared to others gossan materials from this mining area (Abreu et al., \n\n2012a,b; Santos et al., 2012) or contaminated soils from other mining areas in the IPB (Abreu et al., \n\n2012a,b; Alvarenga et al., 2008; Rocha et al., 2011). Thus, initial soil was acid with low electrical \n\nconductivity (EC) and very low concentrations of organic C and extractable K and P. However, total N \n\nconcentration was medium with a higher content of N-NO3 than of N-NH4. The enrichment of the S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos soil with iron oxides, in particular in the crystalline fraction, is related to the gossan \n\nmaterials. \n\nThe S\u00e3o Domingos soil can be considered contaminated with As, Cu and Pb (Table 2; CCME, \n\n2007). Total soil concentrations of As, Cu, Pb, V and Zn are in the same range as those reported by \n\nAbreu et al. (2012a,b), \u00c1lvarez-Valero et al. (2008) and Santos et al. (2012) for gossan materials and \n\nsoils developed on gossan from the S\u00e3o Domingos mining area. \n\nNo significant differences among all soil samples (treatments and initial soil) were observed for EC, \n\nextractable P and Fe in iron oxides, both crystalline and non crystalline fractions (Tables 1 and 3). \n\nAmended soils, independently of polyacrylate source, presented values of pH and organic C \n\nsignificantly higher than the control and the initial soil. The increase of soil pH following polymer \n\napplication was observed previously and is related to the exchange of polymer counter ions (Na\n+\n) with \n\nacidic ions in the soil (Qu and de Varennes, 2010). The pH values obtained by these authors were in \n\nthe same range as those obtained after the four months of fallow, except for control which increased \n\n\n\nEvaluation of chemical parameters and ecotoxicity of a soil developed on gossan following application of polyacrylates and \ngrowth of Spergularia purpurea \n\n302 \n\n \n\nfrom 4.7 to 5.9.

Although no significant differences were found for total N and N-NO3 concentrations, N-NH4 \n\nwas the highest in control. This suggests that a greater uptake of N took place during growth of S. \n\npurpurea, related with a greater biomass accumulation in amended soils (Qu and de Varennes, 2010). \n\nThe higher concentrations of N-NO3 and N-NH4 in the control compared to the initial soil can be \n\nrelated to increased microbial activity in soil as a consequence of plants growth and irrigation. \n\nIn general, the rehabilitation using polyacrylate polymers, independently of the source, and S. \n\npurpurea growth improved the chemical characteristics of this type of soils developed on gossan mine \n\nwastes. \n\n \n\nExtractable soil solutions \n\n \n\nThe three different extraction solutions which were used in this work represented distinct processes \n\nand/or chemical reactions that can occur in soil, simulating the potential availability of several \n\nelements, including hazardous elements, for leaving organisms. This comparison will contribute to a \n\nbetter understanding of the behaviour of the polyacrylate polymer in soil during the rehabilitation \n\nprocesses. The amendments increased the pH of leachates and pore water compared to control and \n\ninitial soil. No significant differences in EC from leachates were observed; however the EC values in \n\npore water were almost double following polymer application (Fig. 1). Leachates and pore waters for \n\nthe same treatment had similar pH values suggesting that there were few materials capable of \n\ngenerating acidity. \n\nConcentrations of some chemical elements in the leachates (Cu, Mn, Pb, V and Zn), pore water \n\n(Al, Cu, Mn, Pb, V and Zn) and RHIZO solution (Cu, Mn, Pb and V) were below the detection limit of \n\nthe apparatus (mg/L \u2013 Al and Pb: 0.25; Cu, Mn and Zn: 0.05; V: 0.5). The increase of soil pH and \n\norganic C, due to polymer application, did not influence the concentrations of the elements in these \n\nfractions. \n\nThe elements in aqueous solutions (leachates and pore water) and RHIZO solution from initial soil \n\nrepresented less than 6.7 % and 8.6 % of their total concentrations, respectively (Figs. 2\u20134), with the \n\nexception of Ca in pore water (18.9\u201328.4 % of the total) and RHIZO fraction (33.6\u201350.4 % of the total). \n\nThese percentages are slightly higher than those in the aqueous solutions extracted with the \n\nrhizosphere based-method, in some soils from S\u00e3o Domingos, Caveira and Chan\u00e7a mining areas from \n\nIPB (Abreu et al., 2012a,b). Similar observations were made during the experiment, as these fractions \n\nin all the treatments (control and amended) were in the same range compared to those in initial soil, \n\nexcept for Na (Leachates: 11.5\u201332.9 % of total concentration; Pore water: 7.8\u201360.3 % of total \n\nconcentration). This exception may be related to the addition of artificial urine (as described in Material \n\nand Methods) and the presence of Na+ as counter ion in the polymer. Although the soil had large total \n\nconcentrations of some elements (like As, Cu and Pb), the fractions potentially available for \n\norganisms, before and after polymer application, were small and may represent a low potential \n\nenvironmental risk. \n\n \n\n\n\nEvaluation of chemical parameters and ecotoxicity of a soil developed on gossan following application of polyacrylates and \ngrowth of Spergularia purpurea \n\n305 \n\n \n\nc\n\nb\n\na\naa a\n\na\na\n\nbb\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\np\nH\n\nLeachates Pore water\n\na\n\na\na\n\na\n\na\n\nb\n\nb\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nInitial Soil Control Diapers Polymer\n\nfrom\n\nDiapers\n\nPolymer\n\n7015\n\nE\nC\n\n (\nm\n\nS\n/c\n\nm\n)\n\n \n\nFig. 1 Values of pH and electrical conductivity (EC) in simulated leachates (DIN extraction) and pore water \n\nsolution from initial soil and soils from treatments of the mesocosm assay (control; soils amended with diapers, \n\npolymer from diapers and synthetic polymer 7015).

The high As concentration in aqueous solutions may be explained by the \n\nnegative charges on the polyacrylates reactive groups promoting some cation adsorption, inhibiting \n\nthe formation of low solubility solid phases (e.g. metal arsenates; Santos et al., 2012). The exchange \n\nbetween counter ions (Na\n+\n) in the polymers and acidic ions in the soil can explain the higher Na \n\nconcentration. The increase of the phosphatase activity in amended soil after S. purpurea growth (Qu \n\nand de Varennes, 2010) probably promoted a higher release of phosphate ions. \n\n \n\n\n\nEvaluation of chemical parameters and ecotoxicity of a soil developed on gossan following application of polyacrylates and \ngrowth of Spergularia purpurea \n\n307 \n\n \n\nb\n\nb\n\na\naa\n\nb b\n\naaa\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\nA\nrs\n\ne\nn\n\nic\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n(m\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n D\nry\n\n w\ne\n\nig\nh\n\nt)\n\nLeachates Pore water a\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\naa\na\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\nC\nh\n\nlo\nri\n\nd\ne\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\n\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n\n(m\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n D\nry\n\n w\ne\n\nig\nh\n\nt)\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\naa\na\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nN\nit\n\nra\nte\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\n\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n\n(m\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n D\nry\n\n w\ne\n\nig\nh\n\nt)\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\na\n\na\na\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\nInitial Soil Control Diapers Polymer\n\nfrom\n\nDiapers\n\nPolymer\n\n7015\n\nS\nu\n\nlf\na\n\nte\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n(m\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n D\nry\n\n w\ne\n\nig\nh\n\nt)\n\nb b\n\na\na\n\na\n\nb b\n\na\na a\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nInitial Soil Control Diapers Polymer\n\nfrom\n\nDiapers\n\nPolymer\n\n7015\n\nP\nh\n\no\ns\n\np\nh\n\na\nte\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\n\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n\n(m\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n D\nry\n\n w\ne\n\nig\nh\n\nt)\n\n \n\nFig. 3 Anions concentrations in simulated leachates (DIN extraction) and pore water solution from initial soil and \n\nsoils from treatments of the mesocosm assay (control; soils amended with diapers, polymer from diapers and \n\nsynthetic polymer 7015).

Polymer application increased the concentration of elements in RHIZO solution, except for Zn \n\n(Fig. 4). This can also be associated with the greater S. purpurea growth in these treatments (Qu and \n\nde Varennes, 2010) and more exudation of low-molecular-weight organic acids by roots, capable of \n\nforming complexes and enhancing the availability of the chemical elements (Feng et al., 2005). \n\nComparing results from leachates and pore water (Figs. 2 and 3), the concentrations of Ca and \n\nsulfate in all treatments, as well as Mg, Na and phosphate in amended treatments increased more \n\nthan 20 % in pore water fraction with a simultaneous increase of the EC. Thus, the longer contact with \n\nwater seems to promote the dissolution of solid phases containing these elements and exchanges \n\nwith ions in the polymer. Moreover, Al and As were reduced drastically (24\u201399 %), as well as Fe in the \n\nmajority of the treatments, in pore water compared to leachates (Figs. 2 and 3), suggesting the \n\nformation of new solid phases containing these chemical elements. \n\n\n\nEvaluation of chemical parameters and ecotoxicity of a soil developed on gossan following application of polyacrylates and \ngrowth of Spergularia purpurea \n\n308 \n\n \n\na\n\na\n\na\n\nb\n\nb\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\nA\nlu\n\nm\nin\n\niu\nm\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\n\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n\n(m\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n D\nry\n\n w\ne\n\nig\nh\n\nt)\n\naa\n\nb\n\ncc\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nA\nrs\n\ne\nn\n\nic\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n(m\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n D\nry\n\n w\ne\n\nig\nh\n\nt)\n\nb\nb\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\nC\na\n\nlc\niu\n\nm\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n(m\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n D\nry\n\n w\ne\n\nig\nh\n\nt)\n\nabab\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\nIr\no\n\nn\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n(m\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n D\nry\n\n w\ne\n\nig\nh\n\nt)\n\nb\nb\n\nb\n\na\na\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\nP\no\n\nta\ns\n\ns\niu\n\nm\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n(m\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n D\nry\n\n w\ne\n\nig\nh\n\nt)\n\nb\nb\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\nM\na\n\ng\nn\n\ne\ns\n\niu\nm\n\n c\no\n\nn\nc\n\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n\n(m\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n D\nry\n\n w\ne\n\nig\nh\n\nt)\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\nbb\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\nInitial Soil Control Diapers Polymer\n\nfrom\n\nDiapers\n\nPolymer\n\n7015\n\nS\no\n\nd\niu\n\nm\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n(m\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n D\nry\n\n w\ne\n\nig\nh\n\nt)\n\na\n\na\na\n\na\n\na\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nInitial Soil Control Diapers Polymer\n\nfrom\n\nDiapers\n\nPolymer\n\n7015\n\nZ\nin\n\nc\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n(m\ng\n\n/k\ng\n\n D\nry\n\n w\ne\n\nig\nh\n\nt)\n\n \n\nFig. 4 Chemical elements concentrations in simulated rizosphere solution, extracted with an organic acid solution, \n\nfrom initial soil and soils from treatments of the mesocosm assay (control; soils amended with diapers, polymer \n\nfrom diapers and synthetic polymer 7015). Different letters indicate significant differences (p &lt;0.05). \n\n \n\nIn general, the polymer matrix seems to retain some essential cations, like Ca, Fe, K and Mg, and \n\nhazardous elements, like Al, influencing their availability in soil. However, this behaviour was not \n\nclearly observed in the leachates and pore water. The equilibria established between \n\nwater:soil:polymer, even in the pore water, were not enough to evaluate the total amounts of the \n\nelements retained in the polymer as water can only extract the chemical elements weakly adsorbed. \n\nThe RHIZO solution, due to the presence of organic acids, is a stronger extractant than water. That \n\n\n\nEvaluation of chemical parameters and ecotoxicity of a soil developed on gossan following application of polyacrylates and \ngrowth of Spergularia purpurea \n\n309 \n\n \n\nsolution simulates the rhizosphere processes, namely the complexation of elements released from \n\ninorganic and organic colloids exchangeable positions and, in the present assays, also from the \n\npolyacrylate polymer. In fact, concentrations of the elements in RHIZO solution were higher than those \n\nin leachates and pore water (except for As, K and Na).Nevertheless, this fact suggests that the \n\npolymer matrix can retain a large amount of cations, which can be uptake by the plants only through \n\nroot exudation of organic acids. The increase of the available fraction of the nutrients by the \n\nrizosphere effect can be an advantage for soil rehabilitation processes. \n\nAlthough some hazardous elements increased in the fractions potentially available for organisms \n\nafter polymer application, their concentrations remained low and with small environmental risk. \n\n \n\nPlant development in the lysimeters \n\n \n\nSpontaneous species belonging to the Poaceae, Fabaceae and Asteraceae families (common in \n\nthe mining area), were identified but as expected, S. purpurea was the dominant species, with a \n\nconsiderable biomass from November until June. At the end of the experiment, the fresh biomass of \n\nplants varied with treatment reaching the highest values in control (134.5 g) and in soil amended with \n\npolymer from diapers (131.7 g), compared to soil amended with the 7015 polymer or shredded diapers \n\n(77.7 and 71.4 g, respectively). However, a clear distinction between the chemical characteristics of \n\nsoils from these two groups was not observed. The great heterogeneity of plants species and \n\ninexistence of a considerable quantity of a representative species in some periods did not provide a \n\nclear tendency of natural colonization in relation to soil treatments. \n\nIn the first month of the experiment, the highest germination rate for C. ladanifer was in control (22 \n\nseedlings) but for L. sampaioana it was in the treatment with the 7015 polymer (20 seedlings). \n\nHowever, even in amended soil the mortality rate was very high (over 80 %) and very few shrubs \n\nsurvived, which was the opposite of the observed with S. purpurea (Qu and de Varennes, 2010).  \n\n \n\nPlants bioassays \n\n \n\nPlant characteristics (e.g. seed properties, root morphology and physiology and tolerance/ \n\nsensitiveness) can modify the plant response to toxicity of leachates or contaminated soils (Sheppard \n\net al., 1993). In the present experiment, visible symptoms of toxicity were observed in lettuces in initial \n\nand amended soil using the filter paper test (leaves with light greenish-yellow colour) and in oats from \n\namended treatments using the hydroponic test (leaves with dry tips or brown coloration). \n\nGrowth of Brassica rapa was also very sensitive to soil physical and chemical properties in the \n\nbioassays (Sheppard et al., 1993). Bioassays using leachates or water soil extracts can predict the \n\nrisks of contaminants in ground and surface waters, but they do not show interactions and exchanges \n\nthat occur in soils (Leitgib et al., 2007; van Gestel et al., 2001). Therefore, ecotoxicological tests, \n\ncombining both direct (with whole soil) and indirect (with leachate) are useful. \n\nNo differences were observed among treatments in the studied parameters when using lettuce in \n\nfilter paper and soil tests (Table 4). However, with oat most parameters were different between \n\n\n\nEvaluation of chemical parameters and ecotoxicity of a soil developed on gossan following application of polyacrylates and \ngrowth of Spergularia purpurea \n\n310 \n\n \n\ntreatments (Table 5). The seed germination test using both species was low sensitive what can be \n\nrelated to the low concentration of elements in leachates. Similar results were obtained for germination \n\nof lettuce and other species (broccoli, tomato and radish) with aqueous solutions of Pb or Cu \n\n(Salvatore et al., 2008), and lettuce, both with leachates from soils affected by the Aznalc\u00f3llar pyrite-\n\nmine spill (Valerio et al., 2007) and saturation extracts from sediments collected in the Rodalquilar \n\nmining district (Bagur-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2011). In addition, Salvatore et al. (2008) also pointed out that \n\nseed coats act as a barrier which protects the growth of the embryo. Although root growth is known to \n\nbe more sensitive than germination to chemical elements toxicity (Ara\u00f9jo and Monteiro, 2005; Mart\u00ed et \n\nal., 2007; Salvatore et al. 2008; Valerio et al., 2007), the concentrations of elements in leachates and \n\nRHIZO solution of the soils were too low (Figs. 2\u20134) to inhibit the growth of lettuce roots. In contrast, \n\noat root elongation in the treatment with polymer from diapers was the lowest in the filter paper test, \n\nalthough the chemical characteristics of leachates from this treatment were not different compared to \n\nthe other amended treatments (Figs. 2 and 3). Furthermore, oat root elongation was not correlated to \n\nthe studied chemical characteristics of the leachates. \n\nIn the soil test, the increase of organic C and N in control (Tables 1 and 3), compared with initial \n\nsoil, seems to have promoted oat growth. Initial soil (and control) showed low toxicity as reported for \n\nother gossan samples from S\u00e3o Domingos by Alvarenga et al. (2012). \n\nIn the soil test, the oat root and shoot elongations (Table 5) were negatively influenced by the \n\npolymer application due to some toxicity of this polymer or high concentrations of As, Fe and Na in \n\npore water (\u20130.83 &lt;r &lt;\u20130.95 depending on element). Moreover, in amended treatments the increase \n\nof As and Mg in the RHIZO solution (Fig. 4) could have contributed to reduce shoot elongation (r = \u2013\n\n0.89 and \u20130.82, respectively). Nevertheless, the coexistence of high concentrations of various \n\nchemical elements in the RHIZO solution (Al, As, Ca, Fe, Mg and Na) or pore water (As, Fe and Na) \n\nfrom amended treatments, compared to the control, may have influenced plant growth by direct or/and \n\nantagonism/synergism processes during uptake and translocation. \n\nIn the hydroponic bioassay, the treatment amended with diapers presented the lowest lettuce shoot \n\nelongation (Table 4), but the fresh biomass presented one of the highest values (together with the \n\ntreatment amended with polymer from diapers). The high total fresh biomasses were not related to the \n\nincrease of water accumulation in tissues (data not shown). Although the concentration of Fe in \n\nleachates (the only element which varied between treatments; Figs. 2 and 3) did not influence \n\nnegatively and directly shoot elongation, antagonism or synergism behaviours could occur and \n\ninfluence the translocation of other elements, having significant consequences for plant growth \n\n(Kabata-Pendias, 2011). In general, the studied chemical characteristics of leachates were not \n\ndifferent between amended treatments suggesting that the variation in fresh biomass was related to \n\nother properties that were not analysed. For lettuce (Table 4), all amended treatments presented \n\nhigher values of root elongation compared to control and initial soil, probably due to the higher \n\nphosphate concentration in leachates (r = 0.95). In contrast, the increase of As concentration in \n\nleachates from amended treatments showed no influence in the root elongations (r = 0.88). \n\n\n\nEvaluation of chemical parameters and ecotoxicity of a soil developed on gossan following application of polyacrylates and growth of Spergularia purpurea \n\n311 \n\n \n\nTable 4 Biological parameters obtained in the bioassays with Lactuca sativa (Mean \u00b1 SD; n = 3). \n\n Initial soil Control Diapers Polymer from Diapers Polymer 7015 \n\n   Filter paper test   \n\nSeeds germination (%) 95 \u00b1 7\na\n 90 \u00b1 16\n\na\n 81 \u00b1 22\n\na\n 90 \u00b1 8\n\na\n 86 \u00b1 14\n\na\n \n\nAerial part elongation (mm) 4 \u00b1 1\na\n 6 \u00b1 1\n\na\n 5 \u00b1 1\n\na\n 7 \u00b1 1\n\na\n 10 \u00b1 6\n\na\n \n\nRoot elongation (mm) 20 \u00b1 12\na\n 20 \u00b1 8\n\na\n 18 \u00b1 2\n\na\n 33 \u00b1 11\n\na\n 48 \u00b1 35\n\na\n \n\nFresh biomass (mg) 41.1 \u00b1 10.3\nb\n 58.5 \u00b1 10.1\n\nab\n 52.4 \u00b1 25.0\n\nab\n 73.1 \u00b1 14.4\n\na\n 67.7 \u00b1 11.3\n\nab\n \n\n   Soil test   \n\nSeeds germination (%) 57 \u00b1 29\na\n 81 \u00b1 8\n\na\n 52 \u00b1 22\n\na\n 38 \u00b1 16\n\na\n 57 \u00b1 25\n\na\n \n\nAerial part elongation (mm) 18 \u00b1 4\na\n 16 \u00b1 3\n\na\n 18 \u00b1 11\n\na\n 18 \u00b1 4\n\na\n 19 \u00b1 2\n\na\n \n\nRoot elongation (mm) 35 \u00b1 10\na\n 36 \u00b1 2\n\na\n 36 \u00b1 12\n\na\n 47 \u00b1 38\n\na\n 19 \u00b1 10\n\na\n \n\nFresh biomass (mg) 0.07 \u00b1 0.03\na\n 98.2 \u00b1 28.4\n\na\n 57.4 \u00b1 60.1\n\na\n 29.8 \u00b1 15.7\n\na\n 40.9 \u00b1 12.2\n\na\n \n\n   Hydroponic test   \n\nAerial part elongation (mm) 25 \u00b1 1\na\n 25 \u00b1 2\n\na\n 19 \u00b1 1\n\nb\n 25 \u00b1 3\n\na\n 23 \u00b1 3\n\na\n \n\nRoot elongation (mm) 64 \u00b1 9\nb\n 58 \u00b1 9\n\nb\n 80 \u00b1 7\n\na\n 81 \u00b1 11\n\na\n 92 \u00b1 12\n\na\n \n\nFresh biomass (mg) 196.2 \u00b1 15.5\nb\n 196.7 \u00b1 9.2\n\nb\n 230.4 \u00b1 22.2\n\na\n 244.1 \u00b1 1.0\n\na\n 179.6 \u00b1 20.3\n\nb\n \n\nDifferent letters in same row indicate significant differences (p &lt;0.05). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nEvaluation of chemical parameters and ecotoxicity of a soil developed on gossan following application of polyacrylates and growth of Spergularia purpurea \n\n312 \n\n \n\n \nTable 5 Biological parameters obtained in the bioassays with Avena sativa (Mean \u00b1 SD; n = 3). \n\n Initial soil Control Diaper Polymer from Diaper Polymer 7015 \n\n   Filter paper test   \n\nSeeds germination (%) 100 \u00b1 0\na\n 73 \u00b1 12\n\na\n 47 \u00b1 50\n\na\n 73 \u00b1 31\n\na\n 100 \u00b1 0\n\na\n \n\nAerial part elongation (cm) 11.3 \u00b1 1.6\na\n 14.3 \u00b1 0.9\n\na\n 13.8 \u00b1 0.7\n\na\n 11.2 \u00b1 2.5\n\na\n 14.0 \u00b1 0.8\n\na\n \n\nRoot elongation (cm) 8.6 \u00b1 0.9\nab\n\n 9.6 \u00b1 1.0\na\n 9.7 \u00b1 0.3\n\na\n 6.9 \u00b1 1.8\n\nb\n 8.7 \u00b1 0.2\n\nab\n \n\nFresh biomass (mg) 501.7 \u00b1 83.1\na\n 495.2 \u00b1 87.8\n\na\n 437.8 \u00b1 139.1\n\na\n 416.0 \u00b1 194.7\n\na\n 602.7 \u00b1 112.4\n\na\n \n\n   Soil test   \n\nSeeds germination (%) 7 \u00b1 12\nb\n 13 \u00b1 23\n\nab\n 20 \u00b1 20\n\nab\n 47 \u00b1 12\n\na\n 20 \u00b1 20\n\nab\n \n\nAerial part elongation (cm) 17.0 \u00b1 0.1\na\n 16.9 \u00b1 0.9\n\na\n 11.5 \u00b1 1.2\n\nb\n 11.1 \u00b1 2.0\n\nb\n 11.5 \u00b1 0.1\n\nb\n \n\nRoot elongation (cm) 7.4 \u00b1 0.1\na\n 6.9 \u00b1 1.7\n\na\n 1.4 \u00b1 0.3\n\nc\n 1.9 \u00b1 0.5\n\nc\n 4.4 \u00b1 2.0\n\nb\n \n\nFresh biomass (mg) 118.9 \u00b1 1.0\nb\n 329.9 \u00b1 1.0\n\na\n 232.5 \u00b1 167.6\n\nab\n 287.0 \u00b1 42.9\n\na\n 193.8 \u00b1 128.0\n\nab\n \n\n   Hydroponic test   \n\nAerial part elongation (cm) 15.3 \u00b1 1.8\na\n 14.5 \u00b1 2.7\n\na\n 8.4 \u00b1 2.1\n\nb\n 7.0 \u00b1 2.7\n\nb\n 9.9 \u00b1 1.7\n\nb\n \n\nRoot elongation (cm) 6.5 \u00b1 0.4\nab\n\n 7.2 \u00b1 0.9\na\n 5.3 \u00b1 1.2\n\nab\n 4.5 \u00b1 1.5\n\nb\n 5.8 \u00b1 0.9\n\nab\n \n\nFresh biomass (mg) 879.8 \u00b1 154.5\na\n 667.1 \u00b1 119.4\n\nab\n 478.2 \u00b1 83.6\n\nb\n 313.2 \u00b1 1.0\n\nb\n 417.6 \u00b1 173.1\n\nb\n \n\nDifferent letters in same row indicate significant differences (p &lt;0.05). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nEvaluation of chemical parameters and ecotoxicity of a soil developed on gossan following application of polyacrylates and \ngrowth of Spergularia purpurea \n\n \n\n313 \n\n \n\nComparing the toxicity indexes reported by Bagur-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2011), that used paper filter test \n\nand distilled water as blank, the leachates from all the present treatments and initial soil indicated no \n\n(indexes values > 1) or low (indexes values from 0 to \u20130.25) toxicity depending on plant parameter \n\nand plant species. Lettuce seed germination was less sensitive (germination index of all treatments: \u2013\n\n0.05 to \u20130.15) than oat (germination index values > 0, except for the treatment amended with diapers \n\nthat presented an index value = \u20130.25). In general, indexes of shoot and root elongations for both \n\nplant species did not suggest a large toxicity (never more severe than low toxicity). For roots, this fact \n\nmay be due to the low elements concentrations, while for shoots the potential toxicity also depends on \n\nelements translocation.  \n\nFor evaluation of the toxicity in aerial part and root elongations, the hydroponic test seemed more \n\nappropriate to evaluate toxicity but the determination of root length from the assays based on plant \n\ngrowth can be more sensitive due to the direct influence of the elements from the leachates. \n\n \n\nMicroalgae and microcrustacean bioassays \n\n \n\nAll bioassays were valid according to the criteria established in the guidelines. No significant \n\ndifferences in the responses of microalgae and Daphnia were observed between leachates from initial \n\nand control soils: around 97 % of toxicity effects on D. magna (Fig. 5) and stimulation of algae growth \n\n(inhibition effect: \u201325 % I and \u201312 % I, respectively; Fig. 6) suggests that the growth cycle of S. \n\npurpurea did not decrease the toxicity of leachates towards these organisms. Initial soil and control \n\nhad a considerable toxicity only when the indirect test with D. magna was used. Similar results were \n\nobtained in leachates from soils collected in Caveira and Lousal mines which showed 100 % of D. \n\nmagna mortality but percentages of P. subcapitata growth inhibition null for Lousal soils and between \n\n22 and 87 % for Caveira soils (Rocha et al., 2011). Other authors also reported the existence of \n\ntoxicity in other gossan samples from S\u00e3o Domingos (EC50 of 26 % V/V; Alvarenga et al., 2012) and \n\nAljustrel mine soils (EC50 of 36 % V/V; Alvarenga et al., 2008) using the D. magna test.  \n\nIn the D. magna bioassay (Fig. 5), the leachates from control and treatment amended with diapers \n\npresented the highest acute toxicity values (98 % and 90 % of toxic effect, respectively). However, the \n\ninhibition of microalgae growth occurred in the treatments associated with the use of diapers (Fig. 6; \n\nDiapers: 6 % I; Polymer from diapers: 27 % I) suggesting a negative influence of the polymer from the \n\ndiapers, which may be different from polymer 7015. No chemical characteristic of the leachates was \n\nstrongly correlated with toxicity for daphnia or microalgae. However, the coexistence of several \n\nchemical elements, even at low concentrations, may amplify acute toxicity (Holmstrup et al., 2010). \n\nThe microalgae bioassay presented a large variability between replicates which may be related to \n\nthe gossan heterogeneity (Santos et al., 2012), and consequently the chemical characteristics of the \n\nleachates (e.g. contents of organic C and nutrients). The growth of microalgae can increase in the \n\npresence of dissolved organic ligands and/or high hydrophobic dissolved organic matter to Fe(III) ratio \n\n(Lee et al., 2009). Thus, the microalgae bioassay seems to be less sensitive when evaluating \n\necotoxicity of leachates with low concentrations of toxic elements and adequate contents of nutrients \n\nand organic C.

The low \n\ntoxicity of the soil is due to the low concentrations of the chemical elements in the fraction usually \n\nreferred as available (extracted with several aqueous solutions) for organisms, which were not \n\nnegatively influenced.  \n\nDaphnia magna test was the only test that showed a clear difference of toxicity between the control \n\nand amended soils leachates. The different sensitiveness of bioassays shows that several \n\necotoxicological tests should be used to assess environmental risk of soil contamination and its \n\nrehabilitation \n\nGrowth of S. purpurea and natural plant colonization improved chemical soil characteristics, but the \n\nuse of the polyacrylate polymers contribute to a further improvement in soil quality (pH and fertility). \n\nHowever, for both autochthones shrubs, C. ladanifer and L. sampaioana, the improvement in soil \n\nconditions did not promote germination and development of the majority of seedlings. \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors would like to thank Carmen P\u00e9rez, David Romero and Catia \n\nRibeiro for technical support; and the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) for \n\nfunding of the research centers UIQA and CEER and for the PhD grant (SFRH/BD/80198/2011). \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\nAbreu, M.M., Batista, M.J., Magalh\u00e3es, M.C.F., Matos, J.X., 2010a.

CONCLUS\u00d5ES GERAIS \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nConclus\u00f5es gerais \n \n\n321 \n\n \n\nO presente trabalho incluiu um estudo abrangente sobre a potencial reabilita\u00e7\u00e3o de dois tipos de \n\nescombreiras, uma rica em sulfuretos e outra de materiais de gossan, da mina de S\u00e3o Domingos com \n\nrecurso a res\u00edduos org\u00e2nicos e inorg\u00e2nicos de baixo valor e a esp\u00e9cies aut\u00f3ctones e tolerantes mas \n\ncom valor econ\u00f3mico, Cistus ladanifer e Lavandula pedunculata. Deste modo, atrav\u00e9s do trabalho \n\ndesenvolvido foi poss\u00edvel concluir que: \n\na. Os solos da mina de S\u00e3o Domingos como de outras \u00e1reas mineiras da Faixa Piritosa Ib\u00e9rica \n\nPortuguesa (ex. Brancanes, Caveira, Chan\u00e7a, Lousal e Neves Corvo) apresentam uma grande \n\nheterogeneidade das suas caracter\u00edsticas qu\u00edmicas em especial das concentra\u00e7\u00f5es totais de \n\nelementos potencialmente t\u00f3xicos (EPTs). Independentemente das elevadas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es totais de \n\nEPTs (ex. As, Ba, Cu, Pb, Sb e Zn), da baixa fertilidade e baixo valor do pH dos solos bem como da \n\nvariabilidade intra- e inter-populacional observada, as plantas de C. ladanifer e L. pedunculata \n\ncrescem sem sinais vis\u00edveis de toxicidade ou defici\u00eancia nutricional apresentando caracter\u00edsticas \n\nadequadas para o seu uso em programas de fitoestabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o. Estas caracter\u00edsticas traduzem-se por \n\nintensa absor\u00e7\u00e3o de EPTs, mas reten\u00e7\u00e3o dos mesmos nas ra\u00edzes, baixa transloca\u00e7\u00e3o dos EPTs para \n\na parte a\u00e9rea, comportamento de plantas n\u00e3o acumuladoras, concentra\u00e7\u00f5es na parte a\u00e9rea abaixo do \n\nm\u00e1ximo permitido para consumo por animais dom\u00e9sticos e sistema radicular denso. Al\u00e9m disso, as \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00f5es dos EPTs nas plantas de ambas as esp\u00e9cies n\u00e3o afectam significativamente as \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00f5es dos nutrientes. \n\nb. A adaptabilidade destas esp\u00e9cies \u00e0s condi\u00e7\u00f5es extremas da \u00e1rea mineira de S\u00e3o Domingos \n\nrelaciona-se com a exist\u00eancia de eficientes mecanismos de toler\u00e2ncia ao n\u00edvel fisiol\u00f3gico e, \n\npossivelmente, a valores de concentra\u00e7\u00f5es geradoras de fitotoxicidade mais elevadas \n\n(comparativamente a popula\u00e7\u00f5es que crescem em \u00e1reas n\u00e3o contaminadas) contribuindo assim para \n\nec\u00f3tipos mais resistentes. Em ambas as esp\u00e9cies, o primeiro mecanismo de toler\u00e2ncia aos EPTs do \n\nsolo \u00e9 a sua acumula\u00e7\u00e3o na raiz e a redu\u00e7\u00e3o da transloca\u00e7\u00e3o destes para locais fotossinteticamente \n\nactivos. Na L. pedunculata, apesar de alguns EPTs (As, Mn e Zn) atingirem concentra\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nconsideradas fitot\u00f3xicas na parte a\u00e9rea, componentes fisiol\u00f3gicos importantes para o normal \n\nfuncionamento das plantas (ex. concentra\u00e7\u00e3o total de prote\u00edna ou pigmentos) n\u00e3o s\u00e3o afectados \n\nnegativamente, n\u00e3o sendo desencadeados mecanismos de toler\u00e2ncia, enzim\u00e1ticos e n\u00e3o \n\nenzim\u00e1ticos, relacionadas com o stresse oxidativo. \n\nc. Os produtos derivados das plantas crescendo na \u00e1rea mineira (ex. ch\u00e1/infus\u00e3o de L. \n\npedunculata e bioextractos de ambas as esp\u00e9cies) apresentam viabilidade econ\u00f3mica para diferentes \n\nusos (farmac\u00eautica, cosm\u00e9tica/frag\u00e2ncia ou alimentar) devido aos EPTs n\u00e3o alterarem a sua \n\nqualidade (comparativamente aos mesmos produtos obtidos a partir de plantas colhidas em \u00e1reas \n\nn\u00e3o contaminadas). De facto, a infus\u00e3o de rosmaninho oriundo da \u00e1rea mineira de S\u00e3o Domingos \n\napresenta baixas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de EPTs ou mesmo dentro da gama dos valores obtidos em outros \n\nch\u00e1s/infus\u00f5es, o que demonstra o baixo risco do seu consumo para a sa\u00fade humana. Ao n\u00edvel dos \n\nbioextractos vegetais, estes cont\u00eam v\u00e1rios compostos medicinais ou odor\u00edferos com valor econ\u00f3mico. \n\nDeste modo, o uso estas esp\u00e9cies em programas de fitoestabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de solos/escombreiras \n\ncontaminados pode contribuir para um retorno econ\u00f3mico significativo atrav\u00e9s da explora\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\n\n\nConclus\u00f5es gerais \n\n322 \n\n \n\ncomercializa\u00e7\u00e3o destes produtos, reduzindo os gastos de implementa\u00e7\u00e3o/manuten\u00e7\u00e3o do processo \n\nde reabilita\u00e7\u00e3o da \u00e1rea mineira. \n\nd. As escombreiras de gossan e ricas em sulfuretos da \u00e1rea mineira de S\u00e3o Domingos \n\napresentam significativo impacto ambiental devido, principalmente, aos seus grandes volumes e \n\nelevadas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de EPTs que podem lixiviar. As escombreiras ricas em sulfuretos, devido \u00e0 \n\nelevada reactividade e altas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es totais de EPTs, lixiviam solu\u00e7\u00f5es aquosas extremamente \n\n\u00e1cidas e com maiores concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de elementos qu\u00edmicos (avaliados atrav\u00e9s de lixiviados \n\nsimulados e de percola\u00e7\u00e3o) do que as escombreiras de gossan. Deste modo, torna-se imprescind\u00edvel \n\na recupera\u00e7\u00e3o destes materiais. \n\ne. A concep\u00e7\u00e3o de Tecnossolos a partir de materiais ricos em sulfuretos e misturas de res\u00edduos \n\norg\u00e2nicos e inorg\u00e2nicos n\u00e3o foi uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o eficaz para a recupera\u00e7\u00e3o deste tipo de escombreira. De \n\nfacto, apesar da melhoria da qualidade dos lixiviados destes Tecnossolos devido, especialmente, \u00e0 \n\ndiminui\u00e7\u00e3o significativa da dispers\u00e3o de alguns elementos qu\u00edmicos (ex. As, Cu, Fe, Pb e Zn) e de \n\nSO4, esta metodologia n\u00e3o foi suficiente para diminuir/impedir a oxida\u00e7\u00e3o dos sulfuretos, \n\nneutraliza\u00e7\u00e3o dos lixiviados \u00e1cidos e, consequentemente, desenvolvimento de vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o e de outros \n\nprocessos biogeoqu\u00edmicos (ex. actividade enzim\u00e1tica de microrganismos relacionados com os v\u00e1rios \n\nciclos dos nutrientes). \n\nf. Apesar de algumas caracter\u00edsticas dos materiais de gossan (ex. capacidade de reten\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\n\u00e1gua, estrutura ou concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de alguns nutrientes) poderem ser melhoradas apenas com a \n\naplica\u00e7\u00e3o de alguns res\u00edduos inorg\u00e2nicos (pol\u00edmeros hidrof\u00edlicos de poliacrilato), estimulando a \n\ncoloniza\u00e7\u00e3o espont\u00e2nea de vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o herb\u00e1cea, o aumento da fertilidade demonstrou ser um factor \n\nessencial para o desenvolvimento das esp\u00e9cies arbustivas estudadas. Assim, a concep\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nTecnossolos atrav\u00e9s da aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de misturas dos res\u00edduos org\u00e2nicos e inorg\u00e2nicos, principalmente a \n\n75 e 150 Mg/ha, aos materiais de gossan foi uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o eficiente na melhoria das caracter\u00edsticas \n\nf\u00edsicas, qu\u00edmicas e biol\u00f3gicas deste tipo de res\u00edduo de mina e, consequentemente, para acelerar o \n\nprocesso de fitoestabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o com C. ladanifer e L. pedunculata. Al\u00e9m disso, a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o destes \n\nTecnossolos no isolamento dos res\u00edduos ricos em sulfureto foi uma abordagem promissora \n\npermitindo, consequentemente, o estabelecimento das plantas e redu\u00e7\u00e3o da lixivia\u00e7\u00e3o dos elementos \n\nqu\u00edmicos. \n\ng. Assim, o sistema de reabilita\u00e7\u00e3o combinada das escombreiras em estudo demonstrou ser \n\neficiente e sustent\u00e1vel a longo prazo, permitindo a reabilita\u00e7\u00e3o dos res\u00edduos ricos em sulfuretos, estes \n\nque n\u00e3o s\u00e3o naturalmente colonizados por vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o, que est\u00e3o sujeitos a fortes processos erosivos \n\ne s\u00e3o geradores de drenagem \u00e1cida. A inclus\u00e3o, neste sistema, de uma barreira alcalina composta \n\npor res\u00edduos inorg\u00e2nicos carbonatados (brita de rocha calc\u00e1ria + cinzas de biomassa) permitiu \n\nestabilizar os res\u00edduos de sulfureto diminuindo a sua oxida\u00e7\u00e3o e a ascens\u00e3o de solu\u00e7\u00f5es \u00e1cidas ricas \n\nem elementos qu\u00edmicos. Al\u00e9m disso, a concep\u00e7\u00e3o de Tecnossolos foi crucial para a implementa\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nda fitoestabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o com C. ladanifer e L. pedunculata nos res\u00edduos de gossan. Estas esp\u00e9cies de \n\nplantas apresentaram bom desenvolvimento, completando todo o ciclo fenol\u00f3gico, bem como \n\ncomportamentos ecol\u00f3gicos (absor\u00e7\u00e3o, transloca\u00e7\u00e3o e de acumula\u00e7\u00e3o de elementos qu\u00edmicos) \n\nsemelhantes aos observados em ambiente natural e adequados \u00e0 sua utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o neste sistema de \n\n\n\nConclus\u00f5es gerais \n\n323 \n\n \n\nreabilita\u00e7\u00e3o. A elevada produ\u00e7\u00e3o de biomassa das duas esp\u00e9cies poder\u00e1 contribuir, \n\nconsequentemente, para um retorno econ\u00f3mico devido ao seu potencial de uso em v\u00e1rios sectores \n\n(farmac\u00eautica, cosm\u00e9tica/frag\u00e2ncia ou alimentar). \n\n \n\nApesar dos resultados promissores que foram obtidos, como trabalho futuro sugere-se a \n\nimplementa\u00e7\u00e3o do sistema de reabilita\u00e7\u00e3o combinada no campo a fim de confirmar a sua efic\u00e1cia em \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es de clima mediterr\u00e2nico. Al\u00e9m disso, \u00e9 essencial confirmar as concentra\u00e7\u00f5es dos EPTs nos \n\nres\u00edduos vegetais ap\u00f3s obten\u00e7\u00e3o dos bioextractos e ajustar a metodologia de extrac\u00e7\u00e3o dos mesmos, \n\nde modo a obter maiores teores de compostos de valor acrescentado."}]}}}
