This area is characterised by the occurrence of extensive carbonate\nprovinces and mostly dead cold-water coral reefs. The main objectives were: i) \nto obtain information on the megafaunal biodiversity and human impact in the\nstudy area using digital images obtained during ROV (remote operated vehicle)\ndives, and ii) to characterise, in terms of abundance and biomass, the\ncomposition and structure of the benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages\nassociated to the carbonate crust and coral reef habitats using sediment \nsamples collected with a circular boxcore. \nThe megafauna associated to the studied habitats showed a high variety of \nsessile organisms, mainly sponges and anthozoans, and swimming organisms\n(e.g. decapods, cephalopods and fish). Some representative images were \ncompiled in a biodiversity atlas. The images showed that these deep habitats \nare suffering from the impact of anthropogenic activities. Some examples are\nthe lost fishing gear, different types of litter (glass, plastic, metal and textile) \nand also trawl marks on the seabed. \nFrom the nine sediment samples that were collected, a total of 145 \nmacroinvertebrate taxa were identified. The benthic assemblages were highly \nheterogeneous in composition and structure and were represented mainly by\narthropods, annelids and cnidarians. The crustaceans usually dominate the \nassemblages in terms of number of species and individuals but the cnidarian,\nsponges and echinoderms clearly dominate the biomass. The \nmacroinvertebrate samples show high diversity (H\u2019: 2.0-3.3) and evenness (J\u2019: \n0.740-0.974) and low dominance (dominant species representing 10-40% of \nthe total abundance). The Hurlbert\u2019s expected species numbers (ES(50): 11-33) \nreflect the high biodiversity of the studied habitats.  \nThe high ecologic and economic importance of cold-water coral reefs is \npresently highly valued by the society. This study documented some aspects of\nthe biodiversity and man\u2019s impact on cold-water corals in the Gulf of Cadiz,\ntherefore contributing to the better knowledge of these deep-sea habitats. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\nCONTENTS\u00a0\n \n \n \n1.\u00a0INTRODUCTION\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u00a0 1\u00a0\n\u00a0 1.1.\u00a0THE\u00a0DEEP?SEA\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u00a0 1\u00a0\n\u00a0 1.2.\u00a0COLD?WATER\u00a0CORALS\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u00a0 3\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 1.2.1.\u00a0Hypotheses\u00a0of\u00a0coral\u00a0mound\u00a0formation\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u00a0 3\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 1.2.2.\u00a0Biodiversity\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u00a0 4\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 1.2.3.\u00a0Human\u00a0impacts\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u00a0 6\u00a0\n\u00a0 1.3.\u00a0CORAL\u00a0MOUNDS\u00a0IN\u00a0THE\u00a0GULF\u00a0OF\u00a0CADIZ\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u00a0 7\u00a0\n\u00a0 1.4.\u00a0OBJECTIVES\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u00a0 11\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0METHODOLOGY\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u00a0 13\u00a0\n\u00a0 2.1.\u00a0STUDY\u00a0AREA\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u00a0 13\u00a0\n\u00a0 2.2.\u00a0SAMPLING\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u00a0 15\u00a0\n\u00a0 2.3.\u00a0DATA\u00a0ANALYSIS\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u00a0 21\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3.\u00a0RESULTS\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u00a0 23\u00a0\n\u00a0\n4.\u00a0DISCUSSION\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u00a0 31\u00a0\n\u00a0\n5.\u00a0REFERENCES\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\u00a0 35\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nANNEX\u00a0I\u00a0\nANNEX\u00a0II\u00a0\n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n2\n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n1\n\n1. INTRODUCTION \n\n1.1. The Deep-Sea \n\nThe deep-sea is the largest ecosystem in the world but less than 1% of its surface \n\nhas been mapped and studied. The oceans cover 71% of the earth, (61% are in \n\nthe open sea); 88% of the open sea has depths of more than 1000m, 76% has \n\ndepths of 3000 - 6000 Km and the maximum depth, 10912m, occurs at the \n\nMariana Trench (Gage and Tyler 1991). The vast extension and great depth make \n\nthis habitat a challenge to the scientific community and the huge gaps in our \n\nknowledge of the biodiversity and functioning of deep-sea ecosystems make \n\nalmost impossible to predict the effects of man\u2019s impact over the years (Gage \n\n1996). \n\nMost of the deep-sea is encompassed by the mesopelagic, bathypelagic and \n\nabyssopelagic zones. The mesopelagic zone includes the water masses between \n\n200 and 1000 m; it is characterised by the rapid loss of light; fall in temperature \n\n(average values of 4 - 8 \u00baC), decreased levels of oxygen and nutrients, and \n\nincreased pressure. The bathypelagic (1000 \u2013 3000m) and abyssopelagic zones \n\n(3000-6000m) are characterised by the complete absence of light, and by the \n\ndecreasing gradients in temperatures, oxygen and nutrients, and increasing \n\npressure. These water masses interact with the seafloor conditioning the benthic \n\nenvironments which are highly heterogeneous, especially at the continental \n\nmargins where often occur canyons, outcrops, seamounts, cold seeps and a \n\ndiversity of biogenic habitats including cold-water coral reefs. \n\nScientists are studying the deep-sea since the 19th century. John Murray \n\n(1895) reporting on the data and samples collected during the HMS Challenger \n\nexpedition (1872 - 1876), divided the animals into three groups based on their life \n\nhistory traits: i) organisms without pelagic larval stage; ii) organisms with pelagic \n\nlarval stage; iii) organisms that produce large larval supplement. However it was \n\nonly during the decade of 1960 that there was a significant advance in these \n\nstudies with the introduction of semi-quantitative (trawls and dredges) and \n\n\n\n \n \n\n2\n\nquantitative methods (box cores and mega cores). Today the use of manned \n\nsubmersible and remote operated vehicles (ROV) is becoming very common \n\n(Gage 1996). But despite all these technological advances only a negligible part of \n\nthe deep-sea biodiversity is known (Gage and Tyler 1991). It is estimated that \n\nmillions of species in the deep-sea are still unknown to scientists. Because of the \n\nfragile link of the deep-sea organisms to their habitats, a better knowledge of this \n\necosystem is of crucial importance to predict the impact of natural an \n\nanthropogenic changes and take the necessary actions to its sustainable \n\nmanagement.  \n\nFor early naturalists the deep-sea was a sterile environment: \u201cHow could there \n\nbe life in a dark, cold, highly pressurized and anoxic environment?\u201d In fact, the \n\nhydrostatic pressure is an important factor causing stress and leading to the \n\ndevelopment of the necessary physiological adaptations in the organisms that live \n\nin this environment (Ekman 1953). The hydrostatic pressure acting on living \n\norganisms, promotes a physiological balance through biochemical reactions. The \n\nchange in physiological behaviour of species at great depths is more intense when \n\nthe catalytic reactions involve changes in the volume of reagents. Another \n\nimportant factor is the absence of light that in the deep-sea does not allow \n\nphotosynthetic organisms to develop. Despite the absence of light, primary \n\nproduction still occurs at great depth where reducing environments, such as \n\nhydrothermal vents and cold seeps, favour the existence of high biomass faunal \n\ncommunities fed by microbial mediated chemosynthesis (Van Dover 2000). \n\nHowever, the primary production at coastal and superficial waters remains largely \n\nresponsible for the food input to the deep-sea. \n\nThe high biodiversity of the deep sea continues to be highly debated because \n\nof the difficulty in understanding how so many species have evolved and co-exist \n\nin the same habitat. The deep-sea fauna is not primitive and it shows many \n\nsimilarities to other species in shallow waters and at high latitudes. During the \n\nMesozoic period there was an increase in temperature of surface waters; at high \n\nlatitudes, these waters have cooled becoming denser. With the submergence of \n\ncold waters at high latitudes the ocean floor became well oxygenated which made \n\n\n\n \n \n\n3\n\npossible the occurrence of metazoan life (Tanner 2007). Murray and Renard \n\n(1981) suggest that many species might have colonised the deep-sea at higher \n\nlatitudes when the temperature became isothermic on the ocean floor. This pattern \n\ncan be seen in many organisms, such as the class Asteroidea represented by \n\nhundreds of species in the northern and the southern oceans, decapods, fish and \n\nhydrozoans (Murray and Renard 1891).  \n\nImportant changes occurred during the last glaciation when factors impacting \n\nthe distribution of the fauna of the oceans led to the differentiation of the \n\necosystems and their biodiversity (Vinogradova 1997). Today, the theories of \n\nbiological multi-variably in deep-sea ecosystems are generally accepted and the \n\ngreat paradigm lies in the homogeneity of the species that inhabit this ecosystem \n\n(Henry and Roberts 2007). \n\n \n\n1.2. Cold-water corals \n\nIn certain areas of the deep-sea the variability of the environment leads to high \n\nhabitat heterogeneity controlling biological patterns and processes at different \n\nspatial scales, frequently enhancing the complexity of the food webs and the \n\nbiodiversity of the faunal assemblages. A common example of these highly \n\nheterogeneous habitats is the coral reefs. \n\n1.2.1. Hypotheses of coral mound formation \n\nCarbonate mounds can be considered analogous to carbonate fossils that \n\nhave arisen in the Paleocene period (Boulvain 2001; Henriet and Guidard 2002). \n\nBy identifying the factors responsible for coral mound formation it is possible to set \n\na model of the genesis of mounts that represent the accumulation of sediments \n\nand how this occurs. \n\nHypotheses emerged over the years to explain the presence of large swathes \n\nof reefs and wide carbonate mound discovered in the North Atlantic Ocean. One of \n\nthe hypotheses is that the faults draining hydrocarbons from the ocean floor are \n\nresponsible for the development of coral and carbonate mounds in deep water \n\n\n\n \n \n\n4\n\n(Henriet et al. 1998; Hovland and Risk 2003). These carbonate mounds may be \n\nthe natural oceanic process of sealing (Hovland 2004), as the ecosystem is in \n\nbalance with the current conditions of the ocean floor and overlapping water \n\nmasses (Henriet et al. 1998; Hovland et al. 1998; Hovland and Risk 2003; Masson \n\net al. 2003; Sumida et al. 2004). Another hypothesis is that deep water corals and \n\ncarbonate mounds were formed by external conditions such as increased \n\ntemperature and salinity through a process of hydrodynamic turbulence, and high \n\nquantities of food in suspension. In areas where these conditions occur, \n\nmechanisms of particle fluxes and internal waves favour the development of the \n\ncorals and associated benthic fauna. As the coral grows, sediment particles are \n\ntrapped and cemented in the skeleton framework giving rise to the mounds \n\n(Freiwald 2002). The tides and waves are important for the transport of food \n\nparticles to cold-water corals (Frederiksen et al. 1992; White et al. 2005; White \n\n2007). \n\n1.2.2. Biodiversity \n\nBoth deep cold-water reefs and shallow tropical coral reefs can be described \n\nas a complex three-dimension structured habitat providing numerous niches that \n\nmay be occupied by many different species (Figure 1). The structural framework of \n\ncoral reefs serve as refuge and nursery for a diversity of organisms and is \n\nespecially important for many commercially valuable fish and crustacean species \n\n(Bryan and Metaxas 2006). \n\nThe sub-habitats in a coral reef include living coral, the spaces between them, \n\nthe structure of dead corals and sediments around the reefs (Bluhm 2001). Large \n\norganisms (other cnidarians, sponges, anemones, starfish, sea urchins) settle on \n\nthe structure or coral rubble, and smaller species (crustaceans, molluscs \n\npolychaetes) live within coral framework, inside the cavities of dead corals or \n\nwithin the sediments associated to the reef (Burgess and Babcock 2005). Large \n\npredators such as fish, crabs and lobsters live among the coral thickets. The \n\ndiversity of animals associated with deep-sea cold-coral reefs is comparable to \n\nsome tropical coral reefs in shallow water. Clark (2006) mentions about 1300 \n\nNorth Atlantic species found in association with the coral Lophelia pertusa \n\n\n\n \n \n\n5\n\n(Scleractinia). Although the diversity of some animal groups is similar in deep and \n\nshallow waters other, such as certain types of octocorals, molluscs and fish are \n\nmuch less diverse in Lophelia coral reefs than in tropical shallow waters (Cohen et \n\nal. 2006).  \n\nIn living coral reefs, most organisms are found in the vicinity of the reefs, and \n\nonly a few species seem to live in close association to the corals. All sub-habitats \n\nin Lophelia coral have been investigated, but the diversity of associated animals is \n\nnot documented for all (e.g. animals living in coral rubble) (Buhl-Mortensen and \n\nMortensen 2004). \n\n \nFigure 1 \u2013 Lophelia pertusa coral formation on Moroccan Margin. There are few living \npolyps but the skeleton framework is covered by a high diversity of organisms (courtesy \nof MARUM, Bremen). \n\nCold-water and tropical reefs coral share strong similarities in their rate of \n\ngrowth (increase) and destruction (erosion). The same organisms, such as \n\nsponges and worms are responsible for both bio-erosion of reefs in shallow and \n\ndeep water (Bromley 2005). In tropical reefs, there are examples of \n\ncommensalism or mutual relations between organisms. The commensalisms in \n\n\n\n \n \n\n6\n\ndeep water coral reefs are related to the competitive and hard coral habitat, but \n\nare difficult to observe and occur for short periods of time (Birkeland 1997). \n\n1.2.3. Human impacts \n\nHuman impacts on deep cold-water coral reefs are principally caused by \n\nfishing activities (Clark 2006). The decrease of fish in shallow water has led to \n\nexploitation of the species that inhabit deeper waters. Species such as the \n\ngranadiers (Coryphaenoides spp), orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus), \n\nredfish (Sebastes spp) and oreos (Pseudocyttus maculatus, Allocyttus niger) \n\nsuffered drastic decreases in the size of their populations (Kaiser et al. 2000). \n\nThese fish have low growth rates and are highly vulnerable to overfishing; many \n\nlive in adjacent waters or in habitats around coral reefs. Some, such as the redfish \n\nlive among the coral reefs in deep water, both as juveniles and adults (Gianni \n\n2004).  \n\nModern trawlers are designed for fishing over rough terrain or on coral reefs in \n\nthe sea. The impact of the weight of a trawl with all its chains and other pieces \n\neasily crushes the structure of the coral, reducing or completely destroying the \n\nhabitat reef (Hall-Spencer et al. 2002). Observations show that the fishermen \n\nprefer coral reefs because of the high fish abundance in these areas. The \n\nincreased impact of fishing activities on cold-water coral reefs occurred since the \n\nfirst years after the discovery of these habitats and, in many areas, led to their \n\ngradual destruction before conservation measures could be taken (Cryer et al. \n\n2002). In the Tasman Seamounts, the observed reduction of coral fish populations \n\ncaused concern on the fisheries impact on coral reefs (Nellemann et al. 2008) and \n\nin many areas of the European margin, the Lophelia pertusa coral reefs and their \n\nassociated habitats have been reduced to almost 50% of its original size due to \n\noverfishing (Van den Hove 2008).  \n\nThe coral reefs have a low growth rate (0.5 to 2.5 cm per year) and their \n\nrecovery is difficult which aggravates the problem of the destruction of these \n\nhabitats (Dullo et al. 2008). Recent research on the areas of reproduction and \n\ngenetics show that in regions where there was a reduction or destruction of corals, \n\n\n\n \n \n\n7\n\nreproduction is not viable anymore. All these factors contribute to the very slow \n\nrecovery of coral reefs from the action of fishing and explain why, in some cases, it \n\nis no longer possible to recover some areas (Hartl and Clark 1997). A striking \n\nexample are the Tasman Seamounts where affected coral areas were reduced to \n\nbare rock inhabited most solely by with sea urchins (Nellemann et al. 2008). With \n\nthe destruction of these habitats, deep-water fishing begins to be not as profitable \n\nas it was before and shows signs of decline (Jennings and Kaiser 1998).  \n\nThe increasing destruction of coral reefs in deep water has forced \n\ngovernments to create laws to protect this habitat. The coral in Norway, the west \n\ncoast of Great Britain and now also the Tasman Seamounts are among the \n\nprotected areas from fisheries (Halpern 2003). But overfishing in the reefs and \n\nassociated habitats such as seamounts, remains in a disorderly fashion (Krieger \n\n1993). Scientists and governments are aware of the damage caused by these \n\nactivities that are among the most impactful to the marine environment (Masson et \n\nal. 2003). Several animals associated with this habitat are being destroyed before \n\nthey can be studied, as much of the biodiversity of these sites has never been \n\nstudied.  \n\nAnother important impact on marine ecosystems deriving indirectly from man\u2019s \n\nactivities is ocean acidification. Ocean acidification may have devastating \n\nconsequences for corals and other marine organisms whose exoskeletons are \n\nmade of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), a substance that dissolves in acidic \n\nconditions. The discovery that ocean waters are acidifying is recent and this \n\nprocess is thought to be enhanced by climate change and by human activities \n\nsuch as extraction of oil, gas, methane hydrates, the mining of polymetallic \n\nsulfides, the removal of manganese nodules as well as disposed ammunition and \n\neven toxic waste charcoal and plastic wastes (Alvarez-Perez et al. 2005) \n\n \n\n1.3. Coral Mounds in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\nThe Gulf of Cadiz (located between the Iberian Peninsula and Morocco) is one \n\nof the areas in the European margin where extensive carbonate mound provinces \n\n\n\n \n \n\n8\n\nand cold-water corals have been frequently recorded (Foubert et al. 2008). The \n\ntopography provides an optimal condition for coral colonization as it increases the \n\ncurrent flow providing a sustained food chain (Roberts et al. 2006). In the Gulf of \n\nCadiz, scleractinian corals are often associated with a variety of topographical and \n\ngeological features (Foubert et al. 2005) but their occurrence is not confined to \n\nhigh elevations, they also occur in areas of the seabed without ideal topographic \n\nfeatures (Hebbeln 2008).  \n\nAccording to some authors, the occurrence of scleractinian corals in deep \n\nwater is often correlated with areas of seepage where the leaking of hydrocarbons \n\nfrom deep sediment layers (Hovland and Thomsen 1997) caters to local \n\nproduction. Thus, the diapirism and mud volcanism in the Gulf of Cadiz has, or \n\nmay have had in the past, the potential to boost the development of reefs in this \n\narea directly because of the enhanced local production, or indirectly by favouring \n\nthe bacterial-mediated formation of authigenic carbonates (Somoza et al. 2003; \n\nLe\u00f3n et al. 2007), an ideal solid foundation of hard substrate for the settlement of \n\nscleractinian corals (Figure 2).  \n\n \n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Carbonate formation on Moroccan Margin in Gulf of Cadiz. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n9\n\nThe formation of carbonate crusts is related to the low rates of diffusion of fluid \n\nventilation after the eruption of mud, or even periods of inactive mud volcanism \n\n(Le\u00f3n et al. 2007). But a change in the chemical environment associated with the \n\nsedimentary deposit can lead to a partial dissolution of carbonates. The evidence \n\nis provided by strong alteration and dissolution of coral fragments collected from \n\nseveral localities in the Gulf of Cadiz (Kopf 2002; Foubert et al. 2008). Therefore, \n\nvolcanic activity may have a slightly negative influence in the maintenance and \n\ndevelopment of deep water coral ecosystems in the Gulf of Cadiz. Another \n\nnegative factor affecting the saturation of aragonite and calcite that may be \n\nconsidered is ocean acidification.  \n\nThe fossil scleractinian corals are distributed throughout the Gulf of Cadiz \n\nbetween the Spanish and Moroccan margins. Sediment samples collected from \n\nthe mounds revealed a significant number of corals embedded in the sediment \n\n(Foubert et al. 2008). The variety of species of scleractinian coral is high and the \n\nmost common species are Lophelia Pertusa, Madrepora oculata, Dendrophyllia \n\nalternata and Eguchipsammia cornucopia (Wienberg 2009). Most scleractinian \n\ncorals were found at depths between 500 and 1000m and may also occur in \n\nshallower depths (~280m) along the Moroccan coast (Foubert et al. 2008). \n\nHowever, the records of living scleractinian corals are few and concentrated in the \n\nMoroccan margin as shown by several expeditions in the southern Gulf of Cadiz \n\n(Wienberg et al. 2009). \n\nThe abundant coral fossil record and the almost absence of living colonies in \n\nthe Gulf of Cadiz suggest that the environmental factors and oceanographic \n\ncurrents (oligotrophic waters, and low tides) in the area are no longer favourable \n\nfor the development of thriving reefs today (Foubert et al. 2008).The cold-water \n\nscleractinian corals require a hard substrate, sufficient food and protection to grow. \n\nTherefore, flourishing reefs are found in areas with strong currents where there is \n\nlittle accumulation of sediment and high availability of food (Roberts et al. 2006). In \n\nthe Gulf of Cadiz, the stratification of the Atlantic water masses and the \n\nMediterranean Outflow water is more dramatic than in the north and upwelling \n\nevents are restricted to the western Iberian margins (Garc\u00eda Lafuente and Ruiz \n\n\n\n \n \n\n10\n\n2007). Therefore the Gulf of Cadiz has a low productivity when compared with the \n\nwest Iberia or other Atlantic areas at higher latitudes (Behrenfeld et al. 2005).  \n\nRecent surveys of sediment samples collected throughout the Gulf of Cadiz \n\nindicate that coral reefs in this region developed mostly during the last glaciations \n\n(Gonzalez et al. 2009). There is evidence for the hypothesis that flourishing coral \n\necosystem in the Temperate Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea are restricted to \n\nglacial periods, whereas at higher latitudes, the periods of growth of corals \n\noccurred during the Holocene and last glaciations (Freiwald et al. 2004). The \n\noccurrence of cold-water scleractinian corals in Gulf of Cadiz, however, is not \n\nrestricted to glacial periods, but environmental changes, especially the increase in \n\nsea temperature, may have caused their decline (Wienberg et al. 2009). Lophelia \n\npertusa appears to have grown significantly reaching its heyday during the last \n\nglacial period in the cold water of the Gulf of Cadiz, when the temperature and \n\nmarine circulation were more stable. In contrast, Madrepora oculata seems to \n\nhave a wider tolerance to environmental changes and its occurrence was not \n\nrestricted to the last glacial period while dendrophylliid corals are restricted to \n\nrelatively stable and warm waters are more frequent in warmer periods (Roberts et \n\nal. 2006; Wienberg et al. 2009). Currently, L. pertusa is less common than \n\nMadrepora and their colonies are smaller (Zibrowius 1980; Wienberg et al. 2009). \n\nThe absence of corals over a period of the Holocene, suggests that important \n\nenvironmental changes occurred at that time, namely higher temperatures and the \n\nsudden reduction in current strength of the cold water currents that carry sediment \n\nto the deep-water reef corals (Freiwald et al. 2004).  \n\nThe biodiversity of the faunal assemblages associated to cold-water coral \n\nreefs in the Gulf of Cadiz is poorly studied and the data available refer only to the \n\nPen Duick Escarpment (Almeida 2009). The work carried out by Almeida (2009) \n\nshowed a high biodiversity of this habitat with a total of 293 taxa recorded in the \n\nstudied area. Arthropoda, Annelida and Cnidaria were the most abundant taxa and \n\nthe Arthropoda were also the most species-rich group. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n11\n\n1.4. Objectives \n\nCold-water coral ecosystems are widely distributed along continental margins \n\naround the world. Over the past two decades it has been discovered that they \n\noccur all along Europe from northern Norway along the Irish margin to the Gulf of \n\nCadiz and into the Mediterranean Sea (Tasker et al. 2002). Whereas off Norway \n\nand Ireland thriving cold-water coral ecosystems are quite common, similar vivid \n\ncommunities have only recently been reported from the Mediterranean (Fossa et \n\nal. 2002). Up to now there are no records of the existence of thriving cold-water \n\ncoral reefs in the Gulf of Cadiz. Almost all reports on cold-water coral findings in \n\nthis region refer to dead scleractinian coral framework and rubble although there \n\nare a few records of living colonies too. \n\nThis study was carried out to investigate several locations on the extensive \n\ncarbonate provinces of the Gulf of Cadiz, with a particular focus on the biodiversity \n\nassociated to carbonate crust and cold-water coral habitats. The biological \n\nmaterial for the present work was collected during the cruise 64PE284, carried out \n\nin the Gulf of Cadiz onboard the RV Pelagia in February-March 2008 This \n\nexpedition was a contribution to the HERMES project (Hotspot Ecosystem \n\nResearch along the Margins of the European Seas, integrated project funded \n\nwithin the 6th FRP of the European Union). \n\nThe main objective of the present work is to document some aspects of the \n\nbiodiversity and man\u2019s impact on cold-water corals habitats in the Gulf of Cadiz. \n\nThe specific objectives are: \n\nI. to compile imagery information on the biodiversity of megafauna and \n\nhuman impact in coral habitats from the analysis of digital photos \n\ncaptured during the ROV Cherokee dives \n\nII. to characterise the composition and structure both in terms of \n\nabundance and biomass of the benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages \n\nassociated with the carbonate and coral habitats from the analysis of \n\nbox core sediment samples \n\n\n\n \n \n\n12\n\nThe results of this work are a contribution to the integrated project HERMIONE \n\n(Hotspot Ecosystem Research and Man\u2019s Impact on European Seas, collaborative \n\nproject funded within the 7th Framework programme of the European Union), \n\nwhich is a follow-up of the above mentioned HERMES project. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n13\n\n2. METHODOLOGY \n\n2.1. STUDY AREA \n\nThe Gulf of Cadiz is located west of the Strait of Gibraltar (between Spain and \n\nMorocco), on the boundary of the African and Iberian plates, in an area with a \n\ncomplex oceanography and a series of active geological processes. \n\nThe Spanish and Moroccan margins of the Gulf of Cadiz are influenced by \n\ndifferent water masses (Figure 3) the northern part is influenced mainly by the \n\nMOW (Mediterranean Outflow Water), and the south by NACW (North Atlantic \n\nCentral Water) less saline and cooler (Ambar et al. 2002). In the Gulf of Cadiz the \n\nmovement of masses of water is complex, and the waters of the Atlantic generally \n\ncolder (coming from depths of 200 to 1800 m) mingle with the highly salty waters \n\nof the Mediterranean. The different water masses interact with the seafloor at \n\ndifferent depths and are one of the main responsible for the distribution of \n\nsediments along the margins in the Gulf of Cadiz (Gonzalez et al. 2009).  \n\n \n\nFigure 3 - General circulation patterns in the Gulf of Cadiz (adapted from Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., \n2006). The present day circulation patterns and the hydrographical conditions in the Gulf of Cadiz \nare dominated by the exchange of water masses through the Strait of Gibraltar. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n14\n\nThe main geodynamic processess include two plate driving mechanisms: i) \n\nsubduction associated with the formation of the accretionary wedge (not active at \n\npresent) and ii) oblique collision between Iberia and Nubia that caused thrusting in \n\nthe Horseshoe Abyssal Plain and dextral wrenching along the SWIM area (active) \n\n(Zitellini et al. 2009). These processes favour the occurrence of widespread mud \n\nvolcanism, mud diapirism, and the formation of carbonate mounds and chimney \n\nstructures related to hydrocarbon-rich fluid venting (Pinheiro et al. 2003; Van \n\nRansbergen, 2005). The mud volcanoes and their adjacent habitats, such as \n\ncarbonate crusts and cold-water coral reefs, sustain highly diverse biological \n\nassemblages (Rodrigues et al. 2008; Almeida 2009).  \n\nDuring the 64PE284 cruise (Hebbeln et al. 2008) the study areas focused on \n\ncarbonate provinces, at depths between 300 and 1000m in the Spanish and \n\nMoroccan margins in the Gulf of Cadiz and also on the Coral Patch Seamount, \n\nWest off the Gulf of Cadiz (Figure 4). As mud volcanism is widespread in the area \n\nsome of the video observations and samples were carried out in the vicinity or at \n\nthe flanks and crater of mud volcanoes (eg. Pipoca, Mercator and Mekn\u00e8s). \n\n \n\nFigure 4 - Carbonate provinces in the Spanish and Moroccan margins in Gulf of \nCadiz, with the location of the different areas sampled during the cruise 64PE284. \nFrom Hebbeln (2008). \n\n\n\n \n \n\n15\n\nDetailed bathymetric maps of the study areas in the Spanish margin (Figure 5), \n\nthe Moroccan margin (Figure 6) and Coral Patch Seamount (Figure 7) are shown \n\nbelow. \n\n \nFigure 5 \u2013 The study areas Pipoca mud volcano and Anastasya escarpment in the \nSpanish margin, Gulf of Cadiz. From Hebbeln (2008). \n\n  \n\n2.2. SAMPLING \n\nVideo surveys \nThe ROV Cherokee (Figure 8) was used for the video survey of the selected \n\nstudy areas. The Cherokee is a commercially available, midsize inspection class \n\nROV, manufactured by Sub-Atlantic, Aberdeen adapted and enhanced for \n\nscientific purposes. During the cruise 64PE284, the system was operated by \n\nMARUM and FIELAX pilots/technicians. The ROV Cherokee is 1000m depth \n\nrated, but due to several \u201ccut offs\u201d and terminations of the umbilical supply cable, \n\nonly a diving depth of 850m was guaranteed during this cruise. Four video \n\n\n\n \n \n\n16\n\ncameras are mounted on the ROV for observation and navigational purposes. A \n\ncolour video zoom camera (720x576 lines), a modified digital Nikon still camera \n\n(3.2 Megapixel) with associated flash light and two mini video cameras for the \n\noverview to the front and back areas of the vehicle. For scientific sampling and \n\nexperiments, a small hydraulical manipulator system is used.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6 \u2013 The study areas in the Moroccan Carbonate Mound (CM) Belt.

From Hebbeln (2008). \n\n\u00a0\n\nDuring the cruise 64PE284 eleven dives were carried out: two in the Spanish \n\nmargin; eight in the Moroccan margin and one in the Coral Patch Seamount (Table \n\n1). Because Dive #03 was cancelled and Dives #08 and #10 were used solely for \n\n\n\n \n \n\n18\n\nthe recovery of colonization experiments, only the remaining eight dives were used \n\nfor the analysis. Time tagged photo frames were taken during the dives and \n\noccasionally faunal samples were also collected (Table 1). The photo frames were \n\ncarefully examined and the megafauna present was identified with the highest \n\npossible taxonomical resolution. For the most conspicuous taxa, selected photos \n\nand a list of records were compiled in an Atlas. The visual records of \n\nanthropogenic impacts were listed and categorised into litter, lost fishing gear and \n\ntrawl marks. \n\nTable 1 - Metadada of the eleven dives carried out during the cruise 64PE284 in the Gulf of Cadiz. \nFrom Hebbeln (2008). \n\n  \n\nMacrofauna \n\nA NIOZ TV-guided box-corer was used for the collection of surface sediment \n\nduring the cruise 64PE284. The TV camera was mounted on the side of the box \n\n(Figure 9) enabling a targeted sampling of the seabed. The box-corer has a barrel-\n\nlike shape with a diameter of 50 cm and a length of 55 cm.  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n19\n\n \n\nFigure 9 \u2013 a) TV-guided box corer; b) rinsing water for fauna sampling; c) sub-\nsampling of the box corer. From Hebbeln (2008). \n\nThe TV-guided box corer was deployed at a total of 14 stations. Nine \n\ndeployments were successful, although three of them were tilted or disturbed and \n\ntherefore standard sampling was not possible (Table 2). After the collection of the \n\nbox-core, the water on the sediment was filtered and the surface of the box was \n\nphotographed and described. All conspicuous organisms in the surface of the \n\nsediment were picked and immediately fixed in 96% ethanol. Biological material \n\nwas retrieved from the nine successful deployments. One fourth of the box core \n\nsurface was used for macrofaunal sampling (A= 0.049m2). The upper 25-30 cm of \n\nthe sediment were collected and the washed through a sieve column (2, 1 and \n\n0.5mm mesh sizes). The fauna in the two coarser fractions was sorted and kept in \n\n96% ethanol to enable genetic barcoding. The finer fraction (0.5 to 1 mm) of the \n\nsieved sediments was also kept in 96% ethanol but it was stained with rose \n\nBengal and was sorted later under a stereoscopic microscope. The faunal \n\nsamples collected during the ROV dives (Table 1) were also kept in 96% ethanol \n\nfor further analysis. \n\nIn the laboratory the organisms were sorted into families and their biomass \n\n(fresh weight) was weighted to the nearest 0.0001g. Later the specimens were \n\nexamined under a stereoscopic microscope and whenever possible identified to \n\nspecies level. After the taxonomic identification, the organisms will be curated and \n\ndeposited in the Biological Research Collection of the University of Aveiro, in the \n\nDepartment of Biology and will be available for further studies.\u00a0\n\n\n\n \n \n\n18\n\nTable 2 \u2013 Metadata of the successful box-core deployments during the cruise 64PE284 that were used for macrofaunal analysis.

DATA ANALYSIS \n\nData analysis of the macrofaunal quantitative samples (box-core) was \n\nperformed using the statistic package Primer V.5 (Clarke &amp; Warwick 2001). The \nbiodiversity was assessed by diversity (Shannon-Wiener H\u2019), and equitability \n\n(Pielou J\u2019) indices, Hulbert (1971) expected species richness (ES(n)) and k-\n\ndominance curves. Shannon-Wiener diversity index assumes that individuals are \n\nrandomly sampled from an \u201cindefinitely large\u201d population and that all species are \n\nrepresented in the sample (Magurran, 1988); its values depend on the sample \n\nsize. Pielou\u00b4s evenness index (J\u2019) assumes that all species in the community are \n\naccounted for in the sample (Magurran 1988), and it varies from 0 to 1.0 (with 1.0 \n\nrepresenting a situation where all species are equally abundant. k-dominance \n\ncurves consist of plotting the cumulative ranked abundances (y-axis) against \n\nspecies (x-axis) that are ordered by decreasing abundances in a logarithmic scale \n\n(Lambshead et al. 1983). The shape and position of the curve allow the \n\ninterpretation of community structure. Communities dominated by a small number \n\nof species have a high value of y-axis intersection point. Curves with a long \u201ctail\u201d \n\nindicate a large quantity of rare species in the community. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n22\n\n\n\n \n \n\n23\n\n3. RESULTS \n\nMegafauna observations  \n\nThe information compiled from the digital photo frames obtained during the \n\nROV dives was compiled into an Atlas (not included in this thesis) organized by \n\nthe different megafaunal groups. Information and selected images of bioturbation \n\nmarks and anthropogenic impacts is also reported. For the construction of the \n\nAtlas a total of 958 frames were analysed, from which the 404 photos that best \n\ncharacterized the different habitats were selected. The number of taxa identified \n\nduring each dive was recorded (the average duration of a dive was about 3 hours). \n\nSome selected images are shown in Annex I. \n\nVery few and small colonies of living scleractinians were observed and most of \n\nthe coral areas consisted of dead coral framework or coral rubble. Most \n\nmegafaunal species associated to these areas were anthozoans that showed a \n\nhuge diversity of forms. Among those the most frequently observed were \n\nChelidonisis aurantiaca and Isidella elongata. Sponges also showed a large \n\ndiversity and decapod crustaceans were also quite frequent, especially the large \n\ncrab Paromola couvieri. Among the fish, most species were observed during the \n\ndive at the Coral Patch Seamount; in the other areas the most common species \n\nassociated with corals was Helicolenus sp.  \n\nDuring the dives there were also frequent observations of human impact on \n\nthe sea floor. These were mostly trawl marks, lost fishing gear and a diversity of \n\nlitter (metal tools, cans, bottles, plastic, clothes, etc.).

DISCUSSION  \n\nThis work contributed with a first effort to compile visual information on the \n\ncomposition of megafaunal assemblages in the Carbonate Mound Provinces of the \n\nGulf of Cadiz. Once the verification of the identifications by specialist taxonomists \n\nwill be made, the Atlas that was compiled from the photo frames taken with the \n\nROV will be a extremely helpful tool in future work in this region and in the \n\ncharacterization of cold-water coral habitats. The record of traces of man\u2019s impact \n\non the seafloor is also an important contribution as it can be a powerful outreach \n\ninstrument and a call for attention on the conservation and management needs of \n\ndeep-sea ecosystems. \n\nA total of 145 macrobenthic invertebrates were identified in the samples \n\ncollected during the cruise 64PE284 in the carbonate mound provinces along the \n\nSpanish and Moroccan margins of the Gulf of Cadiz. From the taxa listed, \n\napproximately one third are new records of species for carbonate and cold-water \n\ncoral habitats in this region. Considering that only nine quantitative samples \n\n(accounting for a total area of 0.44m2) and five occasional ROV samples were \n\nanalysed, these results are indicative that our knowledge of the biodiversity of \n\nthese habitats is far from complete. Arthropoda, Annelida and Cnidaria were the \n\nmajor taxonomic groups represented in the samples. A previous study carried out \n\nin the Pen Duick Escarpment (Gulf of Cadiz) also indicates these groups as the \n\nmost representative among the samples analyzed (Almeida 2009)  \n\nThe scleractinian assemblages of the Gulf of Cadiz share many similarities \n\nwith the ones from the northeast Atlantic margin, where carbonate mounds have \n\nbeen identified as the ideal substrate for the development of coral reefs (Roberts \n\n2003). These carbonate mounds are often dominated by the settlement of \n\nLophelia pertusa. As shown by previous studies (Wheeler et al. 2007), Lophelia \n\npertusa prefer the deeper areas, with higher concentration of food particles, to \n\ngrow. The highest concentrations of Lophelia pertusa were found in the stations \n\n12739 and 12748, both in carbonates mounds deeper than 700 m.  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n32\n\nThe carbonate mounds and fossil coral reefs that occur in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\nare highly suitable for the settlement of sessile animals such as sponges \n\ncnidarians and crinoids. The coral framework also operates as a shelter for \n\nanimals of various species crustaceans, mollusks and polychaetes as already \n\nnoticed by Almeida (2009). One of the polychaetes found living in the coral \n\nframework in this study was Eunice norvegicus. This polychaete has been referred \n\nto have a symbiotic relationship with the coral (Costello, 2005) and to have a \n\ncleaning function of the skeletons of corals and their fragments (Reed 2006). In \n\nthe present study a high abundance and taxa richness was observed especially in \n\nthe samples that yielded coral framework in the surface of the sediments (12722 \n\nand 12729 from the Central Carbonate Mounds; 12739 and 12748 from the \n\ncarbonates mounds around Meknes mud volcano). Whereas the highly diverse \n\nand abundant samples from the Moroccan margin were collected in carbonate \n\nmounds, the two samples from the Spanish margin were collected from mud \n\nvolcanoes and showed a much lower abundance and taxa richness. It is likely that \n\ncoral and carbonate areas in the Spanish margin may also yield abundant and rich \n\nmacrofaunal assemblages.  \n\nThe results of this study can be compared with those of a similar study carried \n\nout in the Pen Duick Escarpment (Almeida 2009, Table 7). The communities \n\nassociated with the coral reefs are similar in the Moroccan margin and the Pen \n\nDuick Escarpment, and both studies have a similar number of expected species \n\n(ES(200)=80). Values of species richness, abundance and biomass were very \n\nvariable between the studied stations. The high variability in the assemblages \n\nstudied in the Moroccan margin has also been found in the study of the Pen Duick \n\nEscarpment where the samples were also heterogeneous and yielded different \n\nassemblages with low dominance and high diversity.\u00a0For further comparisons with \n\nother studies more samples would be necessary once the number of samples and \n\nsampled area in this study were very small (nine sample representing less than \n\n0.5 m2). Despite this, the results obtained in this study contribute the knowledge of \n\nthis poorly studied region of the NE Atlantic Ocean.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n33\n\nTable 3 \u2013 Comparison of the studies on cold-water coral from the Gulf of Cadiz.

Only few samples could be analyzed and the data \n\nobtained was not sufficient for a detailed study and interpretation. The variability in \n\nthe results did not allow inferring on which factors control the diversity in the cold-\n\nwater coral reefs in the Gulf of Cadiz. \n\nIt is however possible to conclude that coral reefs and carbonate mounds in \n\nthe Moroccan margin of the Gulf of Cadiz largely contribute to the diversity found \n\nin this region since they provide hard substrate and shelter that are essential for \n\nthe establishment of a wealth of benthic organisms. The destruction of \n\nscleractinean corals by anthropogenic activities can result in an important loss of \n\nhabitat and biodiversity. Because of their slow growth rate, corals are at serious \n\nrisk of collapse in the upcoming years and with them an unimaginable chain of \n\nspecies that might never be studied. \n\nWith the present studies in the deep Gulf of Cadiz is still difficult to quantify the \n\nspecies that inhabit this region, but the rate of new records reported in each study \n\nsuggests that this is an area with a surprisingly high biodiversity. Further studies in \n\nthe Gulf of Cadiz should allow discoveries of more new species and the \n\nunderstanding of the dynamics of its populations. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n34\n\n\n\n \n \n\n35\n\n5.
