Contudo, apesar de existirem muitos estudos sobre \u00e1reas em restaura\u00e7\u00e3o, \nabordando sua biodiversidade e algumas fun\u00e7\u00f5es ecossist\u00eamicas, o papel do solo nessas florestas em restaura\u00e7\u00e3o \npermanece ainda pouco conhecido, por exemplo, poucos trabalhos t\u00eam analisado o efeito sobre o solo das \ndiferentes estrat\u00e9gias de restaura\u00e7\u00e3o (e.g., plantio de esp\u00e9cies nativas e regenera\u00e7\u00e3o natural). Nesse contexto, o \nobjetivo desse trabalho foi avaliar e obter uma melhor compreens\u00e3o dos efeitos de diferentes metodologias de \nrestaura\u00e7\u00e3o florestal na recupera\u00e7\u00e3o das propriedades f\u00edsicas e h\u00eddricas do solo, mais especificamente na \nrecupera\u00e7\u00e3o da infiltra\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua no solo. Na primeira parte desse estudo (Cap\u00edtulo 2) foi realizada uma revis\u00e3o \nsistem\u00e1tica da literatura cient\u00edfica, reportando e discutindo os resultados de trabalhos sobre infiltra\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua \nno solo em florestas em processo de restaura\u00e7\u00e3o nos Tr\u00f3picos, por meio do plantio de \u00e1rvores. Os resultados \ndesses trabalhos mostraram que houve um aumento da infiltra\u00e7\u00e3o ap\u00f3s o plantio de \u00e1rvores; tamb\u00e9m observamos \nque a recupera\u00e7\u00e3o da infiltra\u00e7\u00e3o foi mais r\u00e1pida quando a agricultura era o uso anterior do solo; que solos mais \nargilosos (>30% argila) tenderam a exibir maiores aumentos na infiltra\u00e7\u00e3o ap\u00f3s plantio de \u00e1rvores; e que as \nflorestas em restaura\u00e7\u00e3o com 10 ou mais anos evidenciaram valores de infiltra\u00e7\u00e3o mais similares com as condi\u00e7\u00f5es \npr\u00e9-dist\u00farbio do solo (e.g., floresta natural de refer\u00eancia). Os dois cap\u00edtulos restantes do trabalho (Cap\u00edtulos 3 e \n4) foram realizadas em uma \u00e1rea em processo de restaura\u00e7\u00e3o florestal, com plantio de esp\u00e9cies nativas e elevada \ndiversidade, no municipio de Campinas, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brasil. No Cap\u00edtulo 3 foi investigado o efeito da restaura\u00e7\u00e3o \nflorestal na condutividade hidr\u00e1ulica do solo (Ks), verificando a recupera\u00e7\u00e3o da Ks at\u00e9 as condi\u00e7\u00f5es pr\u00e9-dist\u00farbio. \nA Ks foi amostrada no campo em tr\u00eas tipos de uso do solo: (i) pastagem; (ii) \u00e1rea em restaura\u00e7\u00e3o com 9 anos de \nidade; e (iii) florestal natural remanescente. Os resultados desse cap\u00edtulo mostraram que a recupera\u00e7\u00e3o \nda Ks diferiu entre as \u00e1reas em processo de restaura\u00e7\u00e3o; e que os atributos do solo e a recupera\u00e7\u00e3o da Ks foram \ninfluenciados pela intensidade e tempo de uso do solo anterior \u00e0 restaura\u00e7\u00e3o florestal. No Cap\u00edtulo 4 foi avaliado \no efeito do hist\u00f3rico de uso do solo na recupera\u00e7\u00e3o da Ks, dos atributos do solo e da vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o, comparando as \nestrat\u00e9gias de restaura\u00e7\u00e3o ativa vs. passiva (e.g., restaura\u00e7\u00e3o assistida). Nesses cap\u00edtulos conclu\u00edmos que as a\u00e7\u00f5es \nde restaura\u00e7\u00e3o florestal podem melhorar as propriedades f\u00edsicas e h\u00eddricas do solo, por\u00e9m, a recupera\u00e7\u00e3o de \nvalores pr\u00f3ximos aos valores de refer\u00eancia tem grande dificuldade, especialmente quando a \u00e1rea em restaura\u00e7\u00e3o \nteve um hist\u00f3rico de uso intenso do solo. \u00c9 fundamental entender como ocorre a recupera\u00e7\u00e3o do solo nas \u00e1reas \nem processo de restaura\u00e7\u00e3o ecol\u00f3gica em diferentes tipos de climas, florestas e solos. Assim, fica claro a \nnecessidade de pesquisas de longo prazo que foquem no movimento da \u00e1gua no perfil do solo, visando entender \ncomo a restaura\u00e7\u00e3o florestal recupera o processo de infiltra\u00e7\u00e3o da \u00e1gua no solo, inclusive na escala de paisagem \n(e.g., bacia hidrogr\u00e1fica). \n\nPalavras-chave: Restaura\u00e7\u00e3o florestal; Infiltra\u00e7\u00e3o; Hidrologia; Propriedades do solo \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\n \n \n\nABSTRACT  \n\nRecovery of soil hydraulic properties after forest restoration in the Atlantic Forest \n \nKnowledge about forests undergoing restoration across the world is becoming increasingly essential \n\ndue to the benefits of restoring forest for ecosystem functions related to water, such as water infiltration. \nAlthough there is a growing literature regarding the biodiversity and some ecosystem functions in forest \nundergoing restoration, soil responses in these forests remain virtually unknown. Moreover, few works have \nanalyzed the effects on soil of different restoration approaches (e.g., planting of native species and natural \nregeneration). In this context, the main objective of this work was to evaluate and gain a better understanding of \nthe effects of different forest restoration methodologies on the recovery of soil physical and hydraulic properties, \nmore specifically on water infiltration. In the first part of this study (Chapter 2) was conducted a systematic \nreview of scientific literature, reporting and discussing the infiltration measures in tropical forests undergoing \nrestoration by tree planting. The results of this review indicated that infiltration was likely to increase after tree \nplanting; that infiltration recovery was faster when agriculture was the prior land use; that clayey soils (>30% \nclay) tended to exhibit greater increases in infiltration after tree planting; and that restored forests after 10 years \nevidenced more similar infiltration values with the pre-disturbance soil conditions (e.g., natural reference forest). \nThe following two parts of the thesis (Chapter 3 and 4) were based on a restoration program using a high-diversity \nmix of native plantings in the county of Campinas, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. In the Chapter 3 was investigated the effect \nof forest restoration on saturated soil hydraulic conductivity (Ks), verifying the Ks recovery to the pre-disturbance \nsoil conditions. We sampled field Ks under three land-cover types: (i) a pasture; (ii) a restored forest of 9 years of \nage; and (iii) a remnant forest patch. Our results showed that Ks recovery differ markedly among the forests \nundergoing restoration; and that soil attributes and Ks recovery are influenced by the duration and intensity of \nland use prior to forest restoration. In the Chapter 4 we assessed the effects of land use history on the recovery \nof Ks, soil and vegetation attributes, comparing active vs. passive restoration (e.g., assisted restoration). In these \nchapters we conclude that forest restoration actions may improve soil physical and hydraulic properties, but in \nsome cases a complete recovery to reference levels can be difficult, especially when land use was more intense \nprior to forest restoration actions. It is very important to understand soil recovery in forests undergoing \nrestoration on different climate, forest and soil types. Thereby, in future research long-term studies are essential, \nwhich should focus in the water movement through the soil profile and aiming to understand how the forest \nrestoration can recover the infiltration process, also including landscape scale (e.g., watershed). \n\n  \n\nKeywords: Forest restoration; Infiltration; Hydrology; Soil properties \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\n \n \n\n1. INTRODUCTION \n\nRecent forest restoration initiatives are playing a fundamental role in forest cover expansion across \n\nthe planet (Chazdon, 2008; Keenan et al. 2015), through ambitious international (e.g., Bonne Challenge; \n\nNew York Declaration on Forests and Goal 15 in U.N. Sustainable Development Goals), regional (e.g., 20 \n\nx 20 and AFR100) and national initiatives (Chazdon et al. 2017). In Brazil, the Pact for the Restoration of \n\nthe Atlantic Forest has emerged to restore 15 million hectares of forest by 2050 (Rodrigues et al. 2009) and \n\nthe National Plan for the Restoration of the Native vegetation has a goal of restoring 12 million hectares in \n\nthe next 20 years. These restoration efforts are fundamental for human well-being, especially when \n\nconsidering the recovery of biodiversity and ecosystem functions (Sabogal et al. 2015; Aronson et al. 2017). \n\nIn this context, the soils have critical relevance, providing ecosystem services through their functions \n\n(Mendes et al. 2018). Seven ecosystem functions have been highlighted for which soils are critical (Keesstra \n\net al. 2016): (i) biomass production; (ii) storing, filtering and transforming nutrients, substances and water; \n\n(iii) biodiversity pool, such as habitats, species and genes; (iv) physical and cultural environment for humans \n\nand human activities; (v) source of raw material; (vi) acting as carbon pool; (vii) archive of geological and \n\narchaeological heritage. Additionally, since restoration ecology emerged, the importance of soil has been \n\nincreasingly recognized as fundamental to reach the goals of forest restoration programs (Heneghan et al. \n\n2008). Nevertheless, in forest undergoing restoration around the world, most studies have focused on \n\nestablishing aboveground plant communities, but belowground environment (e.g., soil physical and \n\nhydraulic properties), and aboveground-belowground linkages have been neglected. For that reason, some \n\nauthors stated that forest restoration has been \u201cphytocentric\u201d (Kardol &amp; Wardle, 2010; Ohsowski et al. \n\n2012). This situation is evident in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, where a recent literature review emphasizes \n\nthat the monitoring in most of the restoration projects are not considering any soil indicator (59% of 152 \n\npublished works), and they are not including information about reference sites (e.g., old-growth forest and \n\ndegraded lands) (Mendes et al. 2018). The noticeable soil data gaps are a great challenge to forest restoration \n\npractice and a test to soil ecology knowledge, which according with (Bradshaw, 1987) statement, it could \n\nprovide an \u201cacid test\u201d (Heneghan et al. 2008).  \n\nConsidering the aforementioned information, the effects of restoration efforts on soil still requires \n\na better understanding. In particular, water infiltration, which is considered as a key hydrological process \n\nthat influences a large number of essential ecosystem processes, such as groundwater recharge, soil erosion \n\nand surface runoff (Zimmermann et al. 2006; Neary et al. 2009), as well as growth and plant productivity \n\n(Thompson et al. 2010), have been poorly explored in forest restoration contexts. Water infiltration is \n\ndefined as the process of water entry into the soil surface (Brutsaert, 2005). In this way, during rainfall events \n\nthe water can move through the soil profile both vertically and horizontally by the combined effect of gravity \n\nand capillary, also depending on the soil type and slope of the terrain (Elsenbeer, 2001). It is important to \n\nnote that water infiltration is a complex process which depends on a large number of factors, thus, a vast \n\nliterature has been produced in the last century to understand the physics and dynamics of this process \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\n(Assouline, 2013). Since early work of Darcy (1856), it is possible to find in scientific literature several \n\napproaches developing mathematical and numerical tools to quantitatively describe the infiltration process \n\n(e.g., Buckingham, 1907; Richards, 1931; Philip, 1957 among other studies).  \n\nA crucial parameter to characterize water infiltration is the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), \n\nwhich determines how much water will move through the soil under saturated conditions (Elsenbeer, 2001; \n\nHassler et al. 2011). Although Ks is reported to have the greatest variability among soil physical and hydraulic \n\nproperties (Deb, 2012), it is also considered a key indicator to evaluate the effects of land use change on soil \n\nhydrology (Zimmermann et al. 2006; Zimmermann &amp; Elsenbeer, 2008). For instance, removal of native \n\nforest cover followed by settlement of different land uses (e.g., agriculture and pastures) results into soils \n\nwith low values of Ks, which could be associated with increasing erosion, surface runoff and floods (Ziegler \n\net al. 2004; Nyberg et al. 2012). On the contrary, when the land use change occurs from degraded soils to \n\nforested land, using different restoration approaches (e.g., active and passive restoration), the Ks may \n\neventually reach the high values found in pre-disturbance soil conditions. But this recovery may take decades \n\n(Bonell et al. 2010; Ghimire et al. 2014) and can be extremely difficult in some cases (Filoso et al. 2017). \n\nWhile most studies measuring soil physical and hydraulic properties in forest undergoing restoration have \n\nfocused in areas under natural regeneration, actively restored forests and comparisons between restoration \n\napproaches have rarely been considered (Ghimire et al. 2014; Crouzeilles et al. 2017). \n\nCurrently, it is clear that there are several knowledge gaps for soil recovery process after forest \n\nrestoration, and soil is still regarded as a \u201cblack box\u201d by restoration practitioners (Heneghan et al. 2008). To \n\nbridge these gaps and continue opening the \u201cblack box\u201d, our study aims to evaluate and gain a better \n\nunderstanding of the effects of different forest restoration methods on the recovery of soil physical and \n\nhydraulic properties, more specifically on water infiltration. Having that in mind, our work is based on a \n\nforest restoration program in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, planed and implemented by the Forest Ecology \n\nand Restoration Laboratory (LERF) from \u201cEscola de Agricultura Luiz de Queiroz\u201d (ESALQ), University \n\nof S\u00e3o Paulo, in partnership with the Fazenda Guariroba, located in the county of Campinas, S\u00e3o Paulo \n\nState, Southeast Brazil. This program started in 2007 over an area of 300 hectares, testing different \n\nrestoration approaches (e.g., active and passive restoration). Before restoration actions the area was formerly \n\ncovered mainly by low-yielding pastures and presents slope percentages greater than 20%. In particular, tree \n\nplantings were implemented as mixed plantation with high-diversity-mix of seedlings (85 regional native \n\nspecies), aiming to provide economical insurance for landowners and to ensure successional processes. For \n\ndetailed information\u2019s of this restoration model see Preiskorn et al. (2009). Also, it is important to highlight \n\nthat active restoration was implemented on highly degraded soil, with an intense land use history and poor \n\npotential for autogenic restoration, and passive restoration was promoted on a slightly degraded soil, with a \n\nprevious second-growth forest and high potential for autogenic restoration (Rodrigues et al. 2011). \n\n Given the previous context, this thesis consists of five chapters. This first chapter is an overall \n\nintroduction, containing the contextualization of the topic, main objectives, questions and hypotheses that \n\nhave been addressed during the research. The second chapter presents a systematic review of scientific \n\nliterature reporting and discussing infiltration measures in tropical forests undergoing restoration by tree \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\n \n \n\nplanting. In this chapter we also analyzed the potential effect of restoration age and soil texture on \n\ninfiltration responses after tree planting. The third chapter investigates the Ks recovery by field estimation \n\nunder three land covers, namely pasture, 9-year-old undergoing restoration forest, and remnant forest. We \n\nhypothesized that forest restoration can recover surface Ks values to the pre-disturbance soil conditions, \n\nalso the following questions were addressed: (1) Does forest restoration recover top-soil Ks values that \n\ncharacterize the remnant forest? and; (2) Are the measured soil attributes between land covers similar? The \n\nfourth chapter compares the Ks, soil physical and hydraulic properties recovery between soils under active \n\nvs. passive restoration approach. This chapter evaluates whether differences in land use history led to \n\ndifferences in soil and vegetation attributes. Specifically, we hypothesized that Ks would vary with intensity \n\nof land use history, considering that the active restoration site had a more intensive land use history, we \n\nexpected that Ks recovery and vegetation attributes will be higher in the passive restoration. Finally, the fifth \n\nchapter presents a summary of the main results of this study, providing the main conclusions and \n\nrecommendations for future researches. \n\n \n\nReferences \n\nAronson, J., Blignaut, J.

TREE PLANTING EFFECTS ON INFILTRATION CAPACITY IN THE TROPICS: A \n\nSYSTEMATIC AND CRITICAL REVIEW \n\nThis manuscript was submitted in the journal Forest Ecology and Management.  \n\nAbstract \n\nInfiltration of rainfall is one of the most important hydrological processes with \nimportant influence on soil erosion, runoff, soil moisture content and groundwater recharge \nin ecosystems. This is particularly important in forest restoration contexts, considering the \nincreasing number of restoration initiatives around the world promoting tree planting and \nconsequently increasing forest cover. Nevertheless, a comprehensive overview of the effects \nof tree planting on infiltration and the factors controlling these effects is lacking. Here, we \nconducted a systematic review of scientific literature reporting infiltration measures in restored \nforests in the tropics. We found eleven studies representing 67 data comparisons in eight \ncountries. Overall results indicate that infiltration is likely to increase after tree planting in \nforest restoration. Infiltration recovered quickly when agriculture was the prior land use, \nwhereas recovery was slower when trees were planted into pastures and bare soils. There was \na trend in restored forests with soils having >30% clay to exhibit greater increases in \ninfiltration, contrasting with the smaller increases for sandy soils (<30% clay). Restored forests \nafter 10 years evidenced similar infiltration values than the pre-disturbance soil conditions. \nOur findings emphasize the need to monitor water infiltration in restored forests under \ndifferent soil conditions and over time. Finally, we identified six knowledge gaps requiring \nfuture research efforts, that aim to improve our understanding of when and why forest \nrestoration may promote recovery of infiltration in tropical soils. \n\nKeywords: Agriculture; Forest; Forest restoration; Pasture; Saturated hydraulic conductivity \n\n \n\n2.1. Introduction  \n\nRecent global assessments have shown that forest cover is expanding through forest restoration \n\nefforts, resulting in an increase of forest cover at rates of 2.5 million ha yr-1 around the world from 2010 to \n\n2015 (FAO, 2015; Keenan et al., 2015). This increase is usually associated with positive effects on many \n\necosystem functions that are essential to sustain ecosystem services for human wellbeing such as infiltration \n\nof rainwater (Chazdon, 2008; Filoso et al., 2017). Infiltration is a key hydrological process in ecosystems to \n\nmaintain productive soil-water-plant interactions but also with strong effects on soil erosion, runoff, soil \n\nmoisture content and groundwater recharge (Ziegler et al., 2004; Gageler et al., 2014).  \n\nThere have been limited efforts to summarize the effects of forest restoration on infiltration in \n\nthe tropics. The early reviews by Bruijnzeel (2004) and Scott et al. (2005) studied to some extent the impacts \n\nof forest cover expansion on infiltration. Subsequently, Ilstedt et al. (2007) provided a meta-analysis of the \n\nincrease in infiltration after tree planting in formerly agricultural fields. A more recent review by Filoso et \n\nal. (2017) focusing in the impacts of forest restoration on water yields, showed that infiltration was a positive \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\noutcome after restoration activities. However, infiltration is a complex soil attribute with high variability in \n\nboth space and time (Deb and Shukla, 2012), and it is affected by a number of factors, such as soil texture \n\nand structure, past land use, soil type and vegetation, among others (Zimmermann et al., 2006; Leite et al., \n\n2017). Indeed, the influence of these factors on the recovery of infiltration after tree planting is poorly \n\nunderstood and has been neglected by previous reviews (Sun et al., 2018). \n\nHere, we conducted a systematic review of scientific literature with the primary objective of \n\ngathering, synthesizing and discussing the available information on the recovery of infiltration in tropical \n\nforests restored by tree planting in sites under different prior land uses. We also analyzed the potential effect \n\nof restoration age and soil texture on infiltration responses after tree planting. \n\n \n\n2.2. Material and methods \n\n2.2.1. Literature Searching \n\nA systematic literature search was made in December 2017, using ISI Web of Science and SciELO, \n\nwithout any restriction on publication year and including peer-reviewed articles published in English, \n\nSpanish or Portuguese. We used the following combination of terms: (\u201cforest restoration\u201d or \u201cafforestation\u201d \n\nor \u201creforestation\u201d or \u201cforestation\u201d) and (\u201cwater conductivity\u201d or \u201cinfiltrat*\u201d or \u201chydraulic conductivity\u201d or \n\n\u201csoil properties\u201d). These keyword terms found 502 hits. To be included in the analysis, studies had to meet \n\nthe following inclusion criteria; (1) focus on forest restoration actions using trees (e.g., not shrublands or \n\narid ecosystems); (2) report field measurements on infiltration rate or saturated hydraulic conductivity in the \n\nsurface soil (0-10 cm); (3) compare infiltration in the restored forest with either degraded or reference \n\nconditions; (4) reported mean values, standard deviations and sample size; (5) study site located in the \n\ntropical region, between 23.5\u00ba N and 23.5\u00ba S, and thus excluding temperate and boreal forests. \n\nWe only found eight papers that met all criteria. Thus, as suggested by Ilsted et al. (2007) and to \n\nincrease the number of observations in the database, we included the following three subtropical studies: \n\nGilmour et al. (1987), Gageler et al. (2014) and Ghimire et al. (2014), which are slightly outside the tropical \n\nregion but met all other criteria.  \n\n2.2.2. Data Extraction and Database Building \n\nFor each study, we extracted the country, mean annual precipitation, latitude and longitude where \n\nthe infiltration measurements took place. Response variables that could influence infiltration were compiled, \n\nsuch as soil type, soil texture, method of measurement (e.g., disc permeameter, minidisk infiltrometer, \n\nsimple-ring or double-ring), planting type (e.g., monoculture or diverse), restoration age (as the number of \n\nyears since forest planting was established), and land use prior to tree planting (e.g., agriculture, bare soil, \n\npasture or reference forest). Soil type was classified according to the USDA classification system, and \n\nbecause of the important role that soil texture can have on infiltration, soils was grouped in two contrasted \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\n \n \n\ngroups based on clay content: less than 30 percent clay (<30% clay, hereafter \u201csandy soils\u201d) and greater than \n\n30 percent clay (>30% clay, hereafter \u201cclayey soils\u201d) (Basche and DeLonge, 2017). Furthermore, the values \n\nof infiltration rate or saturated hydraulic conductivity in the surface soil were recorded and standardized in \n\nmm.h-1. Since several studies suggest that infiltration recovery might take more than one decade after tree \n\nplanting (Zimmermann and Elsenbeer, 2008; Bonell et al., 2010), a 10-year threshold was used to detect if \n\nwater infiltration could recover to pre-disturbance levels a decade after forest planting. Therefore, \n\nrestoration age was classified in two main groups, namely \u201colder restored forests\u201d (>10 years) and \u201cyounger \n\nrestored forests\u201d (<10 years). \n\nPrevious agricultural lands were areas that have been heavily transformed for agricultural activities, \n\nincluded slash-and-burn agriculture and different croplands (e.g., annual crops). Bare soil included degraded \n\nareas where the topsoil was removed and have been exposed since the disturbance without vegetation cover. \n\nPastures were areas that were highly disturbed by grazing livestock, where the vegetation cover is dominated \n\nby grass and herb species. Reference forests were naturally conserved or minimally disturbed areas that \n\nnever have been totally cleared. These forests contain large trees, understory vegetation and a litter layer \n\nthat covers the soil surface.  \n\n2.2.3. Data Analysis \n\nThe log response ratio (LRR) was used to quantify the effects of tree planting on infiltration \n\nrelative to a control. The LRR was calculated using the following equation (Hedges et al., 1999): \n\nLRR =  ln\nXrest\n\nXref\n     (1) \n\nWhere Xrest is the infiltration value in the restored forest, and Xref is the infiltration value in the \n\nland use prior to tree planting or in the control. The mean effects with 95% confidence intervals were \n\ncalculated for each land use prior to tree planting. Effect size estimates were considered significantly \n\ndifferent from zero if their 95% confidence intervals did not cross zero (Benayas et al., 2009). In order to \n\nfacilitate the interpretation the LRR were back transformed and converted to percentages (Basche and \n\nDeLonge, 2017) in figures, as: \n\nPercent change =  [Exp(LRR) ? 1] ? 100    (2) \n\nIn addition, mean effects of land use prior to tree planting was analyzed according to soil clay \n\ncontent and years since forest planting was initiated. However, given the limited amount of data for bare \n\nsoil (four comparisons from one study), this land use was not considered in the analysis. Also, for agricultural \n\nland uses (clayey soils and >10 years after tree planting), the small number of studies did not allow a suitable \n\ncomparison. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\n2.3. Results  \n\n2.3.1. Infiltration Recovery after Tree Planting under Different Prior Land Uses \n\nOur review included eleven studies, yielding 67 comparisons (Appendix A), which were \n\ndistributed across eight countries. Five studies were conducted in Asia, followed by South America, Africa \n\nand Oceania, each one with two studies. In those studies, annual rainfall ranged from 730 to 5,610 mm. The \n\naverage infiltration values in restored forest was 434 mm.h-1, varying from 11 to 2,592 mm.h-1. The most \n\nstudied soil types were the young soils Inceptisols, with four studies, followed by the highly weathered \n\nOxisols and Ultisols, with three and two studies respectively. Additionally, two studies were conducted on \n\nfertile soils (Alfisols), one study on a volcanic soil (Andisol) and one study on a soil with low permeability \n\n(Vertisols). Most studies (75%) planted monocultures whereas a small number (25%) planted diverse tree \n\narrangements. Monocultures commonly involved Pinus sp. species and Tectona grandis. Conversely, diverse \n\nplantings involved mixes of two (Perkins et al., 2012), five (Gageler et al., 2014), and more than 120 species \n\n(Zwartendijk et al., 2017). Field methods to determine infiltration were predominantly disc permeameters \n\nand double-ring infiltrometers, also, single-ring infiltrometers were used in two studies and a mini disk \n\ninfiltrometer in one study (Figure 1). \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Number of studies by field method used to measure infiltration after tree planting in soils with different land use. Number \nof comparisons in each category are indicated in parentheses. \n\n \n\nMost studies (91%) reported an increase in infiltration after tree planting, and only one study \n\nreported lower infiltration in restored forest when compared to pasture sites (Ghimire et al., 2014). Changes \n\nin infiltration after tree planting ranged widely and varied depending on prior land use (Figure 2). Overall \n\nresults showed that infiltration values in the restored forests were 39% lower than in reference forests, but, \n\nhigher than in agricultural sites (291%), pastures (182%) and bare soil (57%). \n\n \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.

Infiltration Recovery after Tree Planting under Different Prior Land Uses \n\nOur systematic review shows that tree planting during forest restoration has positive effects on \n\ninfiltration in the tropics. This result is consistent with several meta-analyses in a wide range of ecosystem \n\ntypes analyzing other hydrological issues (Ilstedt et al., 2007; Filoso et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2018). However, \n\nthese finding should be interpreted with caution because most of the studies examined in our systematic \n\nreview were conducted in planted monocultures with little information for diverse planting. Furthermore, \n\nin our systematic review only Ghimire et al. (2014) reported a restored forest presenting similar infiltration \n\nvalues than pasture sites. In this case, the restored forest was 25-year-old and used Pinus species (mainly P. \n\nroxburghii and P. patula) in Nepal, moreover, tree planting did not improve infiltration due to removal of \n\nlitter, grazing and fuelwood harvesting that decreased the inputs of organic matter in the restored forest. \n\n\n\n23 \n \n\n \n \n\nThus, infiltration recovery after tree planting is affected by factors such as; soil structure, the increase of \n\npore connectivity, root turnover, inputs of organic matter and growth of vegetation (Godsey and Elsenbeer, \n\n2002; Ziegler et al., 2004).  \n\nOur results are in line with previous studies showing that infiltration recovery is strongly \n\ndependent on the prior land use before tree planting (Ziegler et al., 2004; Zimmermann et al., 2006; Hassler \n\net al., 2011; Zwartendijk et al., 2017; Lozano-Baez et al., 2018). For example, when agriculture was the prior \n\nland use a higher degree of infiltration recovery was observed in restored forests. Similarly, Ilstedt et al. \n\n(2007) found that conversion from agriculture to restored forest in the tropics increased infiltration \n\napproximately three-fold. In contrast, trees planted into bare soil and pasture site produced lower infiltration \n\nrecovery. In the case of conversion from bare soil to restored forest, the interpretation of results is limited \n\nto one study with four observations, thus, our focus will be to compare infiltration responses with agriculture \n\nand pasture as prior land uses. One possible explanation in the marked differences between agriculture and \n\npastures is the increased soil compaction expected due to grazing animal traffic, where the pressure exerted \n\nby the animals can be higher than the pressure exerted by farm machinery (Silva et al., 2003). Furthermore, \n\nhigh soil compaction levels have been associated with a reduction in infiltration in several studies (Mart??nez \n\nand Zinck, 2004; Hamza and Anderson, 2005). \n\nIn all cases infiltration after tree planting was not fully recovered to reference forest levels. This \n\nresult could be associated with the preservation of natural soil conditions in reference forests, such as better \n\nsoil structure, higher organic matter, higher macroporosity, greater soil faunal activity, higher plant diversity \n\nand more complex root systems that benefit the infiltration process (Bruijnzeel, 2004; Leite et al., 2017). \n\nThe increase of infiltration after tree planting could be related to plant species and individual tree effects. A \n\nrecent experiment on natural savannas in West Africa (Ilstedt et al. 2016) found four-fold higher infiltrability \n\nunder trees than open areas, suggesting that an intermediate tree cover could maximize groundwater \n\nrecharge and infiltration. In this sense, tree densities and many plant characteristics such as; root \n\narchitecture, shade and litter could influence infiltration. However, our review found a lack of studies dealing \n\nwith species and tree effects on infiltration in restored forests. There are many studies in natural ecosystems \n\ninvestigating soil-water dynamics (Oliveira et al., 2005; Cooper et al., 2012; Oliveira et al., 2014; Zenero et \n\nal., 2016). This knowledge will be crucial to apply in forest restoration. It is equally important to realize the \n\nsoil impacts that forest restoration could be having during tree planting. For example, if the trees are planted \n\nby hand or shovel the disturbance is minor, but if tree planting with bulldozer or tractor is used then there \n\nis much more disturbance and compaction, affecting the water infiltration negatively (L\u00f6f et al., 2012). \n\n2.4.2. Effect of Soil Texture and Restoration Age on Infiltration after Tree Planting \n\nunder Different Prior Land Uses \n\nResults from the available studies indicated a clear effect of soil texture on infiltration capacity, \n\nshowing differences in infiltration recovery between sandy and clayey soils. In the first case, sandy soils tend \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\nto have a low water retention capacity and a high water infiltration (Oades, 1993; Regelink et al., 2015). The \n\naggregating forces in these soils are weak, this is due mainly to the high sand content, the low biological \n\nactivity and low organic matter content (Fisher and Binkley, 2000). Consequently, it is possible to expect in \n\nsandy soils a slower recovery of infiltration after tree planting (Ampoorter et al., 2007). On the other hand, \n\nclay soils with smaller soil particles (e.g., clay and colloidal particles), interact intensively with cementation \n\nagents (e.g., organic matter and iron oxides) improving soil aggregation and increasing the shrink-swell \n\nforces that, positively affect the formation of soil structure (Fisher and Binkley, 2000; Regelink et al., 2015). \n\nRecovery of soil structure and its stability in clayey soils is essential for the faster recovery of infiltration \n\nafter tree planting (Oades, 1993; Ampoorter et al., 2007; Regelink et al., 2015; Basche and DeLonge, 2017), \n\nas was evident in the comparisons between restored forests versus pastures and reference forests.  \n\nChanges in infiltration after tree planting in forest restoration are related to time (restoration age), \n\nthereby, several studies have suggested that to achieve the pre-disturbance soil conditions it will probably \n\ntake more than a decade (Zimmermann and Elsenbeer, 2008; Bonell et al., 2010; Ghimire et al., 2014). For \n\nexample, Bonell et al. (2010) reported a small increase in infiltration during the first 10 years in Acacia \n\nauriculiformes planting in India, however, infiltration values remain low when compared with reference \n\nforests. Ziegler et al. (2004) argued that infiltration recovery is a process that occurs gradually over the years, \n\nwith lower values in the beginning that will increase with the maturation of the forest. This remark is \n\ncorroborated with our results, comparing the younger restored forests and older restored forests. The fact \n\nthat infiltration in younger and older restored forests did not produce significant differences with reference \n\nforests highlights that the first decade of forest planting could recover the infiltration to a similar pre-\n\ndisturbance level. However, it will probably take decades to achieve a full infiltration recovery. In addition, \n\nthe observed trend between older restored forests and reference forests showed an infiltration recovery, but \n\nthe infiltration values are still far from the reference forests, indicating that to achieve full infiltration \n\nrecovery will be difficult. On the other hand, our results reflect the short duration of most studies (12 years \n\nof mean restoration age) and as Zimmermann and Elsenbeer (2008) highlighted, the recovery process is still \n\ninsufficiently understood and multi-decadal effects of tree planting has not been captured in most of the \n\nstudies (Bonell et al., 2010). Furthermore, in the literature the scarcity of long-term studies measuring \n\ninfiltration after tree planting is a limitation that need further research. \n\n \n\n2.5. Conclusions  \n\n2.5.1. Final Remarks and Future Research Directions  \n\nOur study reinforces the conclusion that infiltration is likely to increase after tree planting in forest \n\nrestoration areas in the tropics. However, it must be noted that the available scientific evidence is severely \n\nlimited. Based on this systematic review we have identified six knowledge gaps requiring future research \n\nefforts to advance our understanding of infiltration after tree planting in forest restoration: \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\n \n \n\n1) Although infiltration is an important indicator of the possible pathways that water could take \n\nin the soil after rainfall, there is a need to study the water movement through the soil profile. Only a few \n\nstudies in restored forests measured water percolation in depths greater than one meter. Moreover, most of \n\nthe studies only considered saturated soil conditions in the infiltration measurements with little information \n\non unsaturated soil conditions. Thus, tension infiltrometer measurements are recommended to describe the \n\ninfiltration in these soil conditions (Salako et al., 2001).  \n\n2) The interactions between infiltration and other soil attributes are poorly understood. Therefore, \n\nmore experiments in restored forests should be performed, considering detailed information about soil \n\nstructure (e.g., soil porosity), also taking into account the influence of soil faunal activity on infiltration. In \n\nthis sense, there are studies in natural ecosystems that would allow a possible comparison with restored \n\nforests (Juh\u00e1sz et al., 2006; Cooper et al., 2012; de Pierre Castilho et al., 2016; Zenero et al., 2016). \n\n3) Details on the effects of forest restoration techniques and the level of disturbance during tree \n\nplanting on infiltration are severely lacking. For example, the role that soil preparation, plant species, \n\ndiversity of plants or tree densities could have on infiltration is virtually unknown. Indeed, most studies that \n\nmeasured infiltration were conducted in monoculture plantings, missing information for diverse plantings \n\nand native species. Therefore, more research comparing infiltration between different restoration \n\ntechniques, considering the level of disturbance during tree planting, the effect of plant species and tree \n\ncover per se should be conducted.  \n\n4) Many studies show that land use history has a great influence on infiltration recovery after tree \n\nplanting (Zimmermann et al., 2006; Hassler et al., 2011), however, the majority of these studies are made \n\nwithout considering the type, duration, and intensity of land use prior to forest restoration. Thus, future \n\nresearch should examine this issue. \n\n5) The scarcity of long-term studies is a limitation. It is important to highlight that most studies \n\nthat measured infiltration were short-term experiments (mean restoration age 12 years). This could be \n\nproblematic and misleading when in some cases the findings in short-term experiments are extrapolated to \n\nlong-term evaluations. \n\n6) There is scant information about recovery rate of infiltration after tree planting. The great \n\nmajority of studies have focused in one measurement over time. Our results suggest that monitoring of \n\ninfiltration in restored forests should be made at fixed time intervals, in order to understand the temporal \n\nvariability of infiltration recovery.  \n\n \n\nReferences \n\nAmpoorter, E., Goris, R., Cornelis, W.

Water, 10(4):453.  \n\n \nAbstract \n\nKnowledge of soil hydraulic properties after forest restoration is essential to \nunderstand the recovery of hydrological processes, such as water infiltration. The increase of \nforest cover may improve water infiltration and soil hydraulic properties, but little is known \nabout the response and extent to which forest restoration can affect these properties. The \npurpose of this study was to investigate the effect of forest restoration on surface saturated \nsoil hydraulic conductivity (Ks), and to verify the Ks recovery to the pre-disturbance soil \nconditions. We sampled field Ks at the surface at 18 plots under three land use types: (i) a \npasture; (ii) a restored forest using high-diversity-mix of plantings (85 native species) of 9 years \nof age; and (iii) a remnant forest patch, in Campinas municipality, S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil. We \nused the Beerkan method for the soil hydraulic characterization. Bulk density (?b), soil organic \ncarbon content (OC), soil porosity and particle size data were also sampled. We found \nconsiderable differences in soil hydraulic properties between land use classes. The highest Ks \nwere observed in remnant forest sites and the lowest Ks were associated with pastures sites. \nThe Ks recovery differs markedly between restored forests. Our results strongly suggest that \nsoil attributes and Ks recovery are influenced by the duration and intensity of land use prior to \nforest restoration. Attention needs to be given to management activities before, during and \nafter forest restoration, especially, where the soil is still compacted, and Ks is low. \n\nKeywords: Beerkan method; Saturated soil hydraulic conductivity; Soil properties; Water infiltration  \n\n \n\n3.1. Introduction \n\nThe global forest restoration movement based on natural regeneration and tree plantations has \n\nincreased the tropical forest cover [1,2]. Nevertheless, soil hydraulic properties responses in these restored \n\nforests are virtually unknown [3,4]. Infiltration is a key hydrological process, which, among others, influences \n\ngroundwater recharge, soil erosion and surface runoff. Indeed, one of the best parameters to understand \n\nand study infiltration is the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity (Ks) [4,5]. The Ks is a soil property with the \n\ngreatest spatial and temporal variability among soil properties. The Ks variability depend on many factors, \n\nsuch as soil types, land uses, soil depths, landscape positions, methods of measurement, physical and \n\nchemical soil attributes [6]. Despite this variation the Ks is a useful and sensitive indicator of the effect of \n\nland use change on soil hydro-physical dynamics [7], which exerts a dominating influence on the partitioning \n\n\n\n32 \n \n\nof rainfall in vertical and lateral flow paths. Therefore, estimates of Ks are essential for describing and \n\nmodelling hydrological processes [8]. \n\nThe Atlantic Forest is one of the most important forest biomes of Brazil that has suffered intense \n\npressure from human occupation, remaining approximately 12% of the original area [9]. Recently, the \n\nAtlantic Forest Restoration Pact has emerged to restore large areas of degraded land. This is the largest \n\nforest restoration initiative in Latin America with a target of restoring 15 million hectares of forest by 2050 \n\n[10]. These efforts have a substantial impact on soil hydraulic properties and can be expected to affect the \n\nhydrological processes in the restored ecosystems. However, these hydrological implications are rarely \n\nconsidered in studies of forest restoration [11]. Current literature reviews in tropical landscapes suggest that \n\nforest restoration can enhance surface Ks [12,13]. Though, most studies on Ks recovery after forest \n\nrestoration in tropical soils are emphasized in areas with natural regeneration or secondary succession \n\n[4,7,14\u201319]. Zimmerman et al. [17] at surface and near-surface (12.5 and 20 cm soil depth) in Brazilian \n\nAmaz\u00f4nia found non-significant Ks recovery during seven years of secondary succession after pasture \n\nabandonment. Recently, Leite et al. [19] by examining four sites of different ages in the Brazilian Caatinga: \n\nan abandoned pasture, a young forest (7 years), an intermediate forest (35 years) and an older forest (more \n\nthan 55 years), observed that forest regrowth promotes surface Ks recovery, increasing progressively with \n\ntime. On the other hand, the effect of active restoration on Ks has been much less studied [20]. Zwartendijk \n\net al. [11] compared surface Ks recovery between degraded lands, semi-mature forest, 2\u201310 year old naturally \n\nregenerating vegetation and fallows that were actively reforested 6\u20139 years ago with 120 native species in \n\nMadagascar. They found higher Ks values in the semi-mature forest, followed by the active reforested sites, \n\nsuggesting that active restoration may decrease the time to recover the soil hydraulic properties. Also, the \n\nimpact of afforestation on Ks has been studied in teak (Tectona grandis) plantations at surface and near-surface \n\n(12.5 and 20 cm soil depth) in the Brazilian Amaz\u00f4nia, where after 10 years the teak plantation shows Ks \n\nrecovery from pasture conditions for all soil depths, but Ks values are still distant from pre-disturbance \n\nconditions [4]. Similarly, an increase in Ks after afforestation practices has been reported by several other \n\ntropical studies [21\u201323].  \n\nTree planting to restore degraded lands is conducted in the expectation that soil hydraulic \n\nproperties will be improved [13]. In order to understand the effect of forest restoration on Ks, we \n\ninvestigated the Ks recovery by field estimation under three land uses, namely pasture, 9?year?old restored \n\nforest and remnant forest. From our best knowledge, no studies have investigated the Ks recovery after \n\nplanting native mixed-species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and compared the results with pasture and \n\nremnant forest. We hypothesized that forest restoration can recover the surface Ks to the pre-disturbance \n\nsoil conditions. The following questions were addressed: 1) Does forest restoration recover top-soil Ks \n\nvalues that characterize the remnant forest? 2) Are the measured soil attributes between the land uses \n\nsimilar? \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\n \n \n\n3.2. Materials and Methods  \n\n3.2.1. Field Site \n\nThis research was carried out in the county of Campinas, S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil (22o 54\u2019 S, 46 o \n\n54\u2019 W). The area is located inside the sub-basin of Atibaia river (2,800 km2), which belongs to the Piracicaba \n\nRiver basin. This region has suffered over 200 years of historical landscape changes. In the Atibaia sub-\n\nbasin, the main land uses are: native vegetation (33%), pasture lands (30%) and crops (17%), as well as the \n\nforest cover increased 5.7% in the last decade [24]. The mean annual precipitation is 1,700 mm and the \n\nmean annual temperature is 20 oC, with rainy months generally concentrated between October and March. \n\nThe native vegetation in the area is classified as seasonal semi-deciduous forest [25]. The two soil types \n\nfound in the study sites are Ultisols and Entisols [26], related to the diverse geomorphology of the region, \n\nwhich is located at the transition between the Atlantic Plateau and the Peripheral Depression \n\ngeomorphological provinces. The rocks in the Atlantic Plateau are mainly composed of granites and gneises, \n\nwhile the Peripheral Depression is characterized by sedimentary rocks. The elevation ranges from 600 to \n\n900 m with an undulating topography and the presence of slopes higher than 20% [27]. \n\n3.2.2. Experimental Design \n\nThe sites were selected to capture variation in soil attributes. Also, the sites accessability was taken \n\ninto account in this selection. We examined the following land use classes: pasture, restored forest and \n\nremnant forest. In each class we selected two sites or toposequences (Figure 1), under pasture (P1 and P2), \n\nunder restored forest (R3 and R4), and under remnant forest (F5 and F6). The maximum separation \n\ndistances among these sites was 15 km in a straight line. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1. Pictures that represent the study sites in the seasonal semi-deciduous forest in Campinas, Brazil. Study sites are \n\nabbreviated with P1 and P2 for pasture, R3 and R4 for restored forest, and F5 and F6 for remnant forest. \n\nP2 \n\nR3 \n\nR4 \n\nF5 \n\nF6 \n\nP1 P1 \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\nThe length of each toposequence was constrained by topography and varied between 100 and 150 \n\nm. Each site was divided into three landscape positions (upslope (U), midslope (M) and downslope (D)). \n\nWithin each landscape position, we located one plot (7 x 7 m in size), resulting in 18 plots altogether. \n\nDetailed characteristcs of the three land use classes are as follows.  \n\nThe Pasture Site P1 (22\u00b049\u201924\u2019\u2019 S, 46\u00b054\u201939\u2019\u2019 W) and P2 (22\u00b054\u201938\u201d S, 46\u00b053\u201926\u201d W) were \n\ncharacterised by a dense cover of grass. The dominant grass species is Urochloa brizantha. Information \n\nobtained with landholders revealed that the pasture sites have been heavily grazed for more than 20 years \n\nand have a stocking rate between 1 to 1.5 animal units ha-1. The measurements at these sites represent the \n\nKs and soil attributes before forest restoration actions.  \n\nThe Restored Forest Sites (R3 and R4) were 9 years old when sampled and located in Fazenda \n\nGuariroba (22\u00b0 53\u201948\u201d S, 46\u00b054\u201928\u201d W). The forest restoration process of an area of 300 ha began in 2007. \n\nThe mixed plantation with high-diversity-mix of seedlings (85 native species), aimed to provide economical \n\ninsurance and ensure successional processes to landowners [28,29]. Site preparation included; grass control \n\nthrough herbicide applications and control of leaf-cutter ants by the distribution of insecticide baits. Direct \n\nseedling planting (3 x 2 m spacing) took place after conventional tillage. The mixed plantation also used \n\nfertilizer and irrigation at the time of planting and during the first year [28,30]. Aerial photographs and \n\ninterviews with local peoples showed that land use history differ between restored forest sites (Appendix \n\nB). Both restored forests were originally deforested more than 100 years ago and planted with coffee (Coffea \n\narabica) during the first decades of the 20th century. After the coffee plantation, the Restored Forest R3 was \n\nplanted with eucalyptus (Eucalyptus sp.), this abandoned forest existed until 2006 without commercial \n\npurpose, although a frequent grazing of cattle occurred, then was harvested and grazing continued one year \n\nbefore the forest restoration. The eucalyptus harvest was made by motor-manual operations and farm \n\ntractor forwarded the logs. The vegetation in the Restored Forest R3 prior to restoration activities consisted \n\nin low shrub and grasses. On the other hand, the Restored Forest R4 after the coffee plantation was used \n\nas pastures for livestock breeding until 1986, subsequently was planted again to coffee and agricultural \n\nterraces were made with heavy track machinery. Then, the coffee plantation was replaced by pasture in 1996, \n\nwhich was similar to pastures sites (P1 and P2), dominated by grass species U. brizantha and without natural \n\nregeneration. \n\nThe Forest Sites (F5 and F6), used as a reference for soil attributes are located in Ribeir\u00e3o \n\nCachoeira forest (22\u00b050\u201913\u2019\u2019 S, 46\u00b055\u201958\u2019\u2019 W), the second largest natural remnant forest with 245 ha in the \n\ncounty of Campinas. The forest present a high tree species diversity, with an average canopy stature of 15 \n\nm and emergent trees reaching up to 35 m tall [31]. \n\n3.2.3. Soil Sampling and Measurements \n\nThe first field campaing started in February and ended in March 2017. A total of four disturbed \n\nsoil samples were collected per plot to determine the soil particle size distribution (PSD) and the soil organic \n\ncarbon content (OC). The PSD was determined by the hydrometer method and soil texture classified \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\n \n \n\naccording to the USDA standards [32]. The OC was determined by the Walkley-Black method [33]. In \n\naddition, four undisturbed soil cores (0.05 m in height and 0.05 m in diameter) were also collected per plot \n\nat the depth of 0 to 0.05 m to determine soil macroporosity (Mac) and microporosity (Mic), using the \n\nRichards pressure chamber with application of 6kPa suction [34]. \n\nInfiltration measurements were taken in a second field campaing during the month of June 2017 \n\n(dry season). We conducted a Ks characterization, using the Beerkan method [35], referred to as BEST. We \n\nchose the BEST test because it is a simple, fast and inexpensive method [36\u201338]. At each plot, we carried \n\nout seven infiltration runs using a steel ring with an inner diameter of 0.16 m inserted approximately 0.01 \n\nm into the soil surface, with a minimum distance between measurements of 2 m. Before ring insertion, the \n\nlitter was removed and, if necessary, the grass and ground cover were cut in order to expose the soil surface. \n\nSampling point selection was influenced by suitable ground conditions for measurment and constraints such \n\nas tree roots, rocks and variations in microtopography. For each infiltration run, we collected one \n\nundisturbed soil core (0.05 m in height and 0.05 m in diameter) at the 0 to 0.05 m depth. We used the \n\nundisturbed soil cores to determine the initial volumetric soil water content (?i), the soil bulk density (?b) \n\nand total soil porosity (Pt) assuming a particle density of 2.65 g cm\u20133 [39]. In each measurement, a known \n\nvolume (150 mL) was repeatedly poured into the cylinder and the time needed for the complete infiltration \n\nof this volume was logged. We repeated the procedure until the difference in infiltration time between two \n\nor three consecutives trials became negligible. At the end of each infiltration test, we collected a disturbed \n\nsoil sample inside the ring area to determine the saturated gravimetric water content, and thus the satured \n\nvolumetric water content (?s) was calculated using the ?b. A total of 126 experimental cumulative infiltrations, \n\nI(t) (L), versus time, t (T), were then deduced, 42 for each land use, 21 for each site and 7 for each plot. \n\n3.2.4. Estimating and Selecting the BEST Algorithm \n\nThe BEST-steady algorithm by Bagarello et al. [40] was used to obtain the Ks (KsB, the subscript B \n\nis used to indicate BEST-steady). This choice was made since it allows to obtain a higher success percentage \n\nof the infiltration runs, as compared with other possibles algorithms, such as BEST-slope [41], and BEST-\n\nintercept [42], whose data require fitting to the transient stage of the infiltration run. Another expected \n\nadvantage of the BEST-steady algorithm is that the possible problems associated with the use of the \n\ntransient infiltration data are avoided. The BEST-steady expresses the KsB with the following equation [43]:  \n\nCbA\n\niC\nK\n\ns\n\ns\n\nsB\n+\n\n=   (1) \n\nWhere is (L T-1) and bs (L) are respectively the slope and the intercept of the regression line fitted \n\nto the data describing steady-state conditions on the cumulative infiltration I (L) versus t (T) plot. Taking \n\ninto account that BEST focuses on the Brooks and Corey relationship for hydraulic conductivity [44], the \n\nA (L-1) and C constants are defined as follows [35]:  \n\n  \n\n\n\n36 \n \n\n( )isr\nA\n\n???\n\n?\n=  (2) \n\n( )\n??\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n??\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n=\n?\n\n1\nln\n\n112\n\n1\n\ns\n\ni\n\nC  (3) \n\nWhere ? and ? are infiltration coefficients commonly set at 0.75 and 0.6 as explained by \n\nLassabatere et al. [3,7,16,19], r (L) is the radius of the disk source, ? is a shape parameter that is estimated \n\nfrom the capillary models [45], ?i and ?s are the initial and final water contents, respectively. Note that ?i \n\nshould not exceed 0.25 ?s, however Di Prima et al. [43] showed that BEST-steady can be applied in initially \n\nwetter soil conditions (?i > 0.25 ?s) without an appreciable loss of accuracy in the predictions of Ks. \n\nTherefore, as suggested by Cullotta et al. [46], the ?i was not considered to affect the reliability of the \n\npredicted Ks. On the other hand, the BEST-steady algorithm failure in some sampling points, providing \n\nnegative Ks values and affecting the reliability of measured Ks. For this reason, we also estimated Ks for the \n\nwhole data set by the near Steady-state phase of a Beerkan infiltration run (SSBI - KsS, the subscript S is used \n\nto indicate Steady-state) [47]. This method is attractive for a simple soil hydraulic characterization but testing \n\nthe ability of this procedure to estimate Ks is necessary. Indeed, in scientific literature there is no exhaustive \n\ntesting of the performances of the SSBI method, notwithstanding that this method has a noticeable practical \n\ninterest. This method estimates Ks through a simple Beerkan infiltration test and an estimate of the so-called \n\nsorptive parameter, ?* (L-1), expressing the relative importance of gravity and capillary forces during a \n\nponding infiltration process [48,49]. With this method KsS is estimated by the following equation [47]:  \n\n1\n*\n+\n\n?\n\n??\n=\n\nr\n\ni\nK\n\nw\n\ns\nsS\n\n (4) \n\nWhere ?w is a dimensionless constant related to the shape of the infiltration front and is set at \n\n1.818 [50]. In this investigation, we considered ?* as a constant and equal to 0.012 mm-1, since it was found \n\nto be usable in tropical soils [47,51]. The reasons of these choice were that we did not find in the literature \n\nother specific support for using a different ?* value for tropical soils. Following Bagarello et al. [47], the \n\nBEST-steady algorithm was chosen to check the SSBI method by comparing KsB and KsS in terms of factors \n\nof difference (FoD), calculated as the highest value between KsB and KsS divided by the lowest value between \n\nKsB and KsS. Differences between KsB and KsS not exceeding a factor of two were considered indicative of \n\nsimilar estimates [49]. \n\n3.2.5. Data Analysis \n\nData sets were summarized by calculating the mean and the associated coefficient of variation \n\n(CV). Following similar investigations [37,52], a unique value of clay, silt, sand, OC, ?b, total porosity, \n\nmacroporosity, microporosity and ?i was determined for each plot by averaging the measured values, \n\nconsidering the small size of the sampled areas [52]. The hypothesis of normal distribution of both the \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\n \n \n\nuntransformed and the log-transformed Ks data were tested by the Lilliefors test [53]. The other parameters \n\nwere assumed normally distributed, and thus, no transformation was performed on these data before \n\nstatistical analysis [54,55]. Treatment means were calculated according to the statistical distribution of the \n\ndata, e.g., geometric means for Ks (log-normal distribution) and arithmetic means for all other parameters \n\n(normal distribution) [56]. According to Lee et al. [55] the appropriate CV expression for a log-normal \n\ndistribution was calculated for the geometric means, and the usual CV was calculated for the arithmetic \n\nmeans. Statistical comparison was conducted using two-tailed t-tests, whereas the Tukey Honestly \n\nSignificant Difference test was applied to compare the data sets. The ln-transformed KsS was used in the \n\nstatistical comparison. A probability level, p = 0.05, was used for all statistical analyses. All analyses were \n\ncarried out in the statistical programming software R [57].  \n\n \n\n3.3. Results \n\n3.3.1. Differences in Soil Attributes among Study Sites \n\nThe PSD showed considerable differences among the soils. Most of the sampled plots presented \n\nsandy loam (P1U, P1M, P1D, R3U, R3M, RD, F5U and F5D) and sandy clay loam textures (R4U, R4M, \n\nR4D and F5M), and the rest clay loam (P2M, F6U and F6M) and loamy textures (P2U, P2D and F6D). The \n\nOC ranged from 14.76 to 35.37 g Kg-1 under Pastures (P1 and P2), from 10.46 to 24.60 g Kg-1 under \n\nRestored Forests (R3 and R4) and from 17.53 to 48.59 g Kg-1 under Remnant Forests (F5 and F6). The ?b \n\nvalues ranged between 1.12 and 1.40 g cm-3 in the pastures, for the restored forests the values ranged from \n\n1.09 to 1.52 g cm\u20133, while in the remnant forests the values ranged from 0.88 to 1.25 g cm-3. The Pt varied \n\nfrom 0.47 to 0.58 cm3 cm-3 in the pastures, from 0.43 to 0.59 cm3 cm-3 in the restored forests and 0.53 to \n\n0.67 cm3 cm-3 in the remnant forests. In general, the highest soil Mac values were observed in the remnant \n\nforests, the intermediate values in restored forests and the lowest values in the pastures.

Estimating and Selecting the BEST Algorithm \n\nOverall the Beerkan method used in this study was found to be robust to measure the Ks in the \n\nfield. However, the BEST-steady algorithm yielded physically plausible estimates (e.g., positive Ks values) in \n\n108 of 126 infiltration runs (85.7% of the cases). The percentage of successful runs was 40 of 42 runs \n\n(95.2%) both in the pasture sites and restored forest. With reference to the Remnant Forest (F5 and F6), \n\nBEST-steady led to failure rate value of 33.3%, leading to lack of estimates in 14 of 42 infiltration runs. In \n\nthese cases, convex cumulative infiltration shaped data always produced a negative intercept of the straight \n\nline fitted to the data describing steady-state conditions, which yielded negative Ks values (Figure 2). On the \n\nother hand, the SSBI method always yielded physically plausible estimates (e.g., positive Ks values). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2. Illustrative examples of the influence of the shape of the cumulative infiltrations on the discrepancies occurring between \nBEST-steady and the SSBI method. (a) Concave-shaped cumulative infiltration curve in which the intercept, bs (mm), of the \nstraight line interpolating the last I vs. t data points is positive and the FoD between the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity \nvalues estimated with BEST-steady (KsB) and the SSBI method (KsS) is small. (b) Convex-shaped cumulative infiltration curve \nwith a negative intercept yielding null KsB. \n\n \n\nSmall differences were found between the KsB and KsS estimates (Figure 3). The means of KsS \n\ndiffered from the corresponding values of KsB, by a factor not exceeding 1.81. The individual determination \n\n(e.g., point by point) of the factors of difference, FoD, did not exceed 2.37 (mean of FoD is equal to 1.51) \n\nand they were less than 2 and 1.5 in the 90% and 53% of the cases, respectively. Therefore, it can be argued \n\nthat the BEST-steady and SSBI method led to similar estimates, given that the individual FoD values were \n\nlower than two in almost all cases.  \n\n\n\n40 \n \n\n \nFigure 3. Comparison between Ks estimated with BEST-steady, KsB, and the SSBI method, KsS. Study sites are abbreviated with P1 \n\nand P2 for pasture, R3 and R4 for restored forest and F5 and F6 for remnant forest. \n\n \n\nThe failure in the BEST-steady algorithm is reported by several studies in subtropical soils, where \n\nOC exceeds 5%. This failure is normally related to the occurrence of hydrophobic conditions [43,46,58]. \n\nNevertheless, our soils showed lower OC values (less than 5%). In addition, the soil hydrophobicity is a \n\ncomplex property and poorly studied in tropical soils [59,60]. Other factors that probably contributed to the \n\nBEST-steady algorithm failure are the heterogeneous soil structure, changes in soil structure during \n\nmeasurement, initial soil moisture and temperature [61,62]. For these reasons, the failure of the BEST-steady \n\nalgorithm should be addressed in detail by future studies, considering a detailed physical, chemical and \n\nmineralogical analyses. Hereafter, for the sake of reliable Ks values and comparison across study sites, only \n\nthe KsS values estimated using the SSBI method were considered. This choice was supported by the fact that \n\nthe SSBI method allowed us to maintain the integrity of the dataset. In addition, the KsS values ranged \n\nbetween 3 and 934 mm h-1, with a high variability inside all study sites. \n\n3.3.3. Saturated Soil Hydraulic Conductivity (Ks) Characterization \n\nEvaluating the surface Ks values by soil texture, greater Ks variation was found in soils with higher \n\nclay content, contrasting with lower variation in soils with higher sand content. Also, soils with higher sand \n\ncontent did not show the higher Ks. In general, the lowest Ks values occurred in pastures plots, for example, \n\nin Pasture P1 the Ks ranged from 10 to 320 mm h-1, and in pasture P2 Ks ranged from 4 to 37 mm h-1, \n\nwhereas the highest Ks values were observed in most remnant forest plots. The sandy loam texture \n\nhighlighted the large differences between Ks in the Restored Forest R3 and Pasture Plots (P1U and P1M). \n\nIn this case, the Ks in the Restored Forest R3 varied from 49 to 267 mm h-1, with the higher Ks evidenced at \n\nthe Restored Forest Plot R3D (average of 180 mm h-1), moreover, the Ks was similar to the Pasture Plot \n\nP1D (average of 110 mm h-1) and most remnant forest plots. For the Remnant Forest F5, the Ks varied from \n\n18 to 660 mm h-1, showing the higher Ks at Remnant Forest Plot F5U (average of 247 mm h-1), which differs \n\nfrom Pasture Plots (P1U and P1M), but, not from Restored Forest R3. In contrast, the Ks at Remnant Forest \n\n\n\n41 \n \n\n \n \n\nPlot F5D (average of 68 mm h-1) exhibited a similar Ks in relation to pasture and restored forest plots. For \n\nthe sandy clay loam texture, the Ks in the Restored Forest R4 (from 6 to 256 mm h-1 and average of 54 mm \n\nh-1) was significantly different from the Remnant Forest Plot F5M (average of 387 mm h-1), furthermore, all \n\nthe plots in the Restored Forest R4 had low Ks variability, similar to the pasture land use. Finally, clay loam \n\nand loam textures showed the same comparison among land uses, characterized by marked differences \n\nbetween lower Ks in the Pasture 2 and higher Ks in the Remnant Forest F6. In particular, the Remnant Forest \n\nF6 evidenced the higher Ks variability (from 33 to 934 mm h-1) in the study sites (Figure 4). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.

Discussion \n\n3.4.1. Effects of Land Use on Soil Attributes and Ks \n\nAlthough the soils in the study area showed some variability, this was overcome by choosing sites \n\nand landscape positions within the different land uses that presented similar soil textural classes in the \n\nsurface horizon. This approach allowed us to group and compare the soil attributes and Ks (Figure 4). In \n\ngeneral, important differences were observed in the soil attributes and Ks between land use classes. These \n\ndifferences could be related to many factors, such as; intensity of past land use [4,23], spatial and topographic \n\nvariations in soil types along the toposequences [63,64], density and diversity of plants, root system, \n\nvegetation type, canopy cover and soil faunal activity, among others [19]. Unfortunately, the influence of \n\nthese factors on soil attributes and Ks after forest restoration is poorly understood and needs to be included \n\nin future studies. \n\nPasture. As expected, Ks was significantly lower under pasture plots than restored forest and \n\nremnant forest plots. This result was directly related to the highest ?b found in the study pastures, which \n\ninfluences the higher soil Mic and lower soil Mac values [65]. Similar findings have been reported be several \n\nauthors [13-15]. An exception to this was related to Pasture Plot P1D, which showed similar Ks values \n\ncompared to the restored forest and remnant forest in the sandy loam texture, suggesting lower soil \n\ncompaction, and consequently higher soil Mac. Also, the highest sand content found in this plot could help \n\nto explain this result. Moreover, the present results illustrate the Ks spatial variability in two different pasture \n\nsites, characterized by a low variation in Ks values. This could be due to the soil compaction [4,13], and the \n\nduration of pasture use in the land use history, which is one of the most important factor for Ks variability \n\nover time [15,17], as well as the cattle grazing intensity could have influenced the Ks variability in the pasture \n\nplots [7]. Otherwise, the lower soil faunal activity and organic matter in pasture land uses are important \n\nfactors when analyzing the soil attributes [15,56]. Especially, the Pasture Plots P1U, P2U and P2M, had OC \n\nsimilar to the remnant forest. These similarities are closely linked to carbon inputs in pastures sites, where \n\nthe root system of grasses, the animal-derived organic matter and application of fertilizers might have \n\nincreased the organic substrate [20,65]. In contrast, Pasture Plots P1M, P1D and P2D showed the lowest \n\nOC values in pasture plots, which could be attributed in part to the higher sand contents in these plots. \n\nRestored forest. The soil texture, understory vegetation (Figure 1) and intensity of past land use were \n\ndifferent in the Restored Forest sites (R3 and R4), these are the most likely reasons for the differences in \n\nsoil attributes and Ks values between both restored forests [23,66]. Also, it is important to underscore that \n\nthis result could have been influenced by possible soil compaction during mechanized soil preparation \n\nduring the forest restoration [67]. The most important soil attributes of the Ks differentiation between \n\nrestored forest sites was the ?b and OC. For example, the higher Ks in the Restored Forest Plot R3D was \n\nassociated to the lowest ?b and higher OC values. Overall, the Restored Forest R3 with higher sand content \n\n(sandy loam texture), exhibited lower OC, lower soil Mic, lower ?b, higher soil Mac and higher Ks than \n\nRestored Forest R4. The higher Ks in Restored Forest 3, relative to pasture plots with similar soil texture \n\n\n\n43 \n \n\n \n \n\n(P1U and P1M), is consistent with the results under teak plantation in the Brazilian Amaz\u00f4nia [4] and pine \n\nplantation in Nepal [23]. Furthermore, plots in the Restored Forest R3 showed no significant differences in \n\nKs from most remnant forest plots. These results can be linked to the land use history in the Restored Forest \n\nR3, where the presence of abandoned eucalyptus forest with a canopy structure for more than 50 years, \n\ninfluenced the low trampling pressure and machinery traffic intensities, suggesting a litter accumulation that \n\ncould have protected the soil surface during this period [68,69]. \n\nIn the second situation, the Restored Forest R4 with higher clay content (sandy clay loam texture), \n\nexhibited higher OC, higher ?b and lower Ks than Restored Forest R3. In particular, the lower Ks compared \n\nto the Remnant Forest Plot (F5M) with a similar soil texture, clearly indicates that the full return to pre-\n\ndisturbance conditions is still far-off [22]. On the other hand, sandy clay loam texture did not include pasture \n\nplots, however, pasture Ks in this soil texture could be assumed to be similar to the Pastures Sites (P1 and \n\nP2), considering the low spatial Ks variability observed in the pasture land use. Thus, the Restored Forest R4 \n\nshowed no significant differences in Ks with pasture sites. This result can be related to past land use intensity \n\nin the Restored Forest R4, in which the combination of coffee plantation and pastures, lead to greater soil \n\nexposure, also, trampling pressure and construction of agricultural terraces, could have caused erosion and \n\nsoil compaction before the forest restoration. The present results agree with several studies [4,16,23], which \n\nsuggest that Ks decrease with increasing land use intensity, as well as Ks recovery will be longer in view of \n\nthe intensive land use. Filoso et al. [13] argued that in some cases the recovery of infiltration after forest \n\nrestoration may be extremely difficult, because of the absence of natural understory vegetation. This \n\nresearch did not directly quantify the herbaceous cover, but in the field we observed that natural regeneration \n\nin the Restored Forest R4 is impeded by the dominance of invasive grass species (U. brizantha), which is also \n\nassociated with the open canopy conditions. Conversely Restored Forest R3 presented visually, a canopy \n\nstructure with greater understory vegetation. Indeed, the canopy cover determines the interception rainfall, \n\nreducing raindrop impact and surface sealing, which could enhance the Ks [19]. Additionally, the higher ?b \n\nvalues in Restored Forest R4, are an indication of lower root and soil organism presence [70], this may \n\nreduce the plant seed germination, reduce root growth and decrease soil oxygen availability, becoming an \n\necological filter in the natural regeneration processes [71,72]. Zimmerman et al. [17] reported that invasive \n\nspecies could delay the Ks recovery in Brazilian Amaz\u00f4nia after a decade of pasture abandonment.  \n\nRemnant forest. Comparing remnant forest plots and pastures plots in the sandy loam, clay loam \n\nand loam textures allowed to detect significantly higher Ks in remnant forest plots. In the case of the sandy \n\nclay loam texture the Remnant Forest Plot F5M showed significantly higher Ks than plots in the Restored \n\nForest R4. In contrast, sandy loam texture showed no significant differences between plots of Restored \n\nForest 3 and Remnant Forest Plot F5U. These results are related to the lowest ?b and higher Mac values that \n\nfavor the Ks, suggesting a higher soil pore connectivity. In the specific case of Remnant Forest Plot F5D in \n\nthe sandy loam texture, no significant differences were found in relation to pasture plots (P1U and P1M). \n\nThis result can be associated with the high ?b and a consequent increase in the soil Mic that was noted in the \n\nRemnant Forest Plot F5D. The soil attributes and Ks values in remnant forest sites could be explained by \n\n\n\n44 \n \n\nthe longer time that these forests have remained undisturbed, which allows to develop a better soil structure \n\nand store more soil carbon [19,66]. These findings are in agreement with those reported by several other \n\nstudies in the Atlantic Forest [63,65]. Additionally, the Ks spatial variability observed in both remnant forests \n\nis in line with previous work of Hassler et al. [7], who attributed the Ks variability in Panama forest soils to \n\noverland flows that results in erosion [19]. Other factors that might have caused the Ks spatial variability in \n\nremnant forest plots are the steepness of sample plots and the soil distribution in the landscape positions \n\n(U, M, D) influenced by contrasting slope and topography.  \n\n3.4.2. Management Implications \n\nThe fact that Restored Forests R3 and R4, showed clear differences in Ks recovery and soil \n\nattributes, may provide evidence that, in some cases, simply planting trees is not, in itself, enough to recover \n\nthe soil attributes to the pre-disturbance soil conditions [23]. Attention needs to be given to management \n\nactivities before, during and after forest restoration, especially, where the soil is still compacted, and Ks is \n\nlow. From this point of view, it is therefore important that monitoring forest restoration programs include \n\ncollection of soil compaction and Ks data to understand the initial compaction degree and water infiltration, \n\nreinforcing the need to compare these values with the pre-disturbance soil conditions. After assessing soil \n\ncompaction and infiltration at the restored forests, management practices could be implemented to alleviate \n\nsoil compaction, such as mechanical loosening techniques (e.g., deep ripping and subsoiling), which may \n\nimprove plant growth [73,74]. In addition, some technical methods in forest restoration that have shown to \n\naid the natural regeneration and soil recovery are: suppressing weedy vegetation and, maintenance and \n\nenrichment planting [28]. \n\nIf the Pasture Sites (P1 and P2) presented here represent the planted pastures of the Atlantic \n\nForest, we could observe that, water infiltration is drastically affected in most cases, regardless of the soil \n\ntexture. This result and negative effects of pastures that have been heavily grazed are well documented \n\n[4,15,17] and have also been confirmed in the present research. Indeed, according to Mart\u00ednez and Zinck \n\n[15] pasture degradation can be improved by rotational grazing and introduction of silvopastoral systems \n\nduring the pasture management. Moreover, there are an increasing number of reports regarding different \n\ntropical land uses, suggesting that lowers Ks may lead to less groundwater recharge and increases in overland \n\nflow frequency [3,7,16,19]. Thus, our results reinforce the need for better management practices in the \n\npastures and restored forests to avoid the soil erosion, conserve water and create opportunities to enhance \n\nwater infiltration [75].  \n\n \n\n3.5. Conclusions \n\nIn this study, the hypothesis that the forest restoration can recover the surface Ks to the pre-\n\ndisturbance soil conditions was not supported for both restored forest sites (R3 and R4). We found two \n\ndifferent situations with marked differences in soil attributes and Ks recovery between restored forest sites. \n\n\n\n45 \n \n\n \n \n\nOur results strongly suggest that soil attributes and surface Ks recovery are influenced by the duration and \n\nintensity of land use prior to forest restoration: while the Restored Forest R3 with a previous lower intensity \n\nof land use showed similar Ks to the remnant forest sites, the Ks recovery in Restored Forest R4 is still far-\n\noff from these remnant forest sites due to greater exposure of the soil and trampling pressure during the \n\nland use history. The present results further illustrate that the measured soil attributes were different \n\nbetween land use classes: pasture, restored forest and remnant forest. They also bring out the inverse \n\nrelationship between Ks and ?b, where the Ks increase as a result of a decrease in ?b, consequently, the \n\ndominance of macropores over micropores, which facilitate the water infiltration.  \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n1.

Our understanding of the effect of land use history and vegetation on the recovery of \nwater infiltration and soil attributes in both restoration strategies is limited. Therefore, we \ninvestigated the recovery of top-soil saturated soil hydraulic conductivity (Ks), soil physical and \nhydraulic properties in five land use types: (i) a secondary old-growth forest; (ii) a forest \nestablished through assisted passive restoration 11 years ago; (iii) an actively restored forest, \nwith a more intensive land use history and 11 years of age; (iv) a pasture with low-intensity use; \nand (v) a pasture with high-intensity use, in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. For these land use \ntypes, we determined the historical land use patterns and conducted soil sampling, using the \nBeerkan method to determine Ks values in the field. We also measured tree basal area, canopy \ncover, vegetation height, tree density and species richness in forest covers. The Ks decreased \nwhen land use was more intense prior to forest restoration actions. Our results indicate that \nland use legacy is a crucial factor to explain the current difference in soil and vegetation \nattributes among study sites. \n\nKeywords: Beerkan method; Forest restoration; Infiltration; Natural regeneration; Pasture \n\n \n\n4.1. Introduction \n\nForest restoration strategies are being implemented around the world through ambitious \n\ninternational (e.g., Bonne Challenge and New York Declaration on Forests), regional (e.g., Initiative 20\u00d720 \n\nand AFR100) and national initiatives such as restoration plans in many countries [1]. Consequently, \n\nsecondary forests have expanded in tropical regions [1,2]. In Brazil, the location of our study area, the \n\n\u201cAtlantic Forest Restoration Pact\u201d aims by 2050 to increase the current forest cover from 17% to at least \n\n30%, with a restoration target of 15 million hectares [3]. These initiatives include both passive and active \n\nrestoration strategies. Passive ecological restoration refers to spontaneous recovery of tree species in an \n\necosystem that has been damaged, while assisted passive restoration involves human interventions to assist \n\nnatural regeneration [4,5]. This can include introduction of propagules and removal of invasive species and \n\n\n\n52 \n \n\npersistent disturbances, for example, fire or livestock grazing [4]. On the other hand, active restoration \n\nrequires a higher human intervention through planting of tree seedlings to accelerate the recovery process \n\n[6,7]. \n\nBoth restoration approaches have been shown to impact positively the provision of ecosystem \n\nservices, as well recovering biodiversity and ecosystem functions [8]. However, most restoration research \n\naround the world has focused on aboveground plant communities, whilst the belowground environment \n\n(e.g., soil physical and hydraulic properties) has been poorly studied [9,10]. For example, the response of the \n\ninfiltration process, and soil physical and hydraulic properties after forest restoration is virtually unknown \n\n[11]. A crucial parameter in the infiltration process is the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), which \n\ninfluences water percolation through the soil matrix [12,13]. It is well known from previous studies that Ks \n\nis highly variable compared to other soil physical properties [14,15]. In fact, the Ks depends strongly on the \n\nhighly variable soil structure, and it is known to vary several orders of magnitude [16,17], especially on \n\nforested soils [18,19]. In general, Ks recovery and soil hydraulic properties have been reported separately in \n\npassive [20\u201324] and active [25\u201328] restoration, but few comparisons between both restoration strategies \n\nhave been conducted. Lozano-Baez et al. [28] investigated the surface Ks recovery under a nine-year-old \n\nactively restored forest in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil and observed that the land use prior to forest \n\nrestoration influences the Ks recovery. Moreover, the few recent comparisons between active and passive \n\nrestoration show contradictory results. For instance, Ks at 12.5 cm depth in Brazilian Amaz\u00f4nia was higher \n\nunder a 15-year-old passively restored forest than a 10-year-old tree plantation [11]. In contrast, other \n\nauthors in Madagascar found much lower surface Ks in 2\u201310-year-old naturally regenerating fallow than \n\nactively restored forest of 6\u20139 years of age [29]. Most previous studies have assessed the recovery of soil \n\nphysical and hydraulic properties without addressing the relationships among soil, vegetation and land use \n\nhistory. These relationships are fundamental to better understand the recovery process (e.g., resilience of \n\nthe ecosystem) and successional trajectories after forest restoration [30,31]. Foster et al. [32] argued that the \n\nimprints of past land use on ecosystems may persist for decades to centuries. In particular, after forest \n\nrestoration, such imprints of past land use on soil (e.g., Ks, soil physical and hydraulic properties) may persist \n\nfor a time frame of more than a decade, as suggested by several studies [12,26,33]. However, the above-\n\nmentioned mechanisms and relationships that affect the recovery process are poorly understood. \n\nAs part of a larger research effort investing the effects of forest restoration on Ks, this study aimed \n\nto extend the work of Lozano-Baez et al. [28] at a new location. Apart from presenting new Ks data for \n\npastures with different land use intensities and a secondary old-growth forest, this paper includes the first \n\nmeasurements of Ks for a forest established through assisted passive restoration in the Brazilian Atlantic \n\nForest. We further quantified and compared the Ks, soil physical and hydraulic properties recovery of active \n\nvs. assisted passive restoration strategies from the same restoration program described by Lozano-Baez et \n\nal. [28]. We examined whether differences in land use history led to differences in these soil attributes (e.g., \n\nKs, bulk density, soil organic carbon content, soil porosity, initial and saturated soil water content) and \n\nvegetation attributes (e.g., basal area, canopy cover, vegetation height, tree density and species richness). We \n\nstudied five land-cover types: (i) a secondary old-growth forest, used as a reference forest (hereafter, RF); \n\n\n\n53 \n \n\n \n \n\n(ii) a forest established through assisted passive restoration (hereafter, APR); (iii) an actively restored forest \n\n(hereafter, AR); (iv) a pasture with low-intensity use (hereafter, LiP); and (v) a pasture with high-intensity \n\nuse (hereafter, HiP). In forest stands, we associated the recovery of Ks, soil physical and hydraulic properties \n\nwith the vegetation attributes. We hypothesized that Ks would vary with intensity of land use in the past \n\namong land-cover types as follows: RF > APR > AR > LiP > HiP. As the AR site had a more intensive \n\nland use history, we expected that Ks recovery and vegetation attributes would be higher in the APR. \n\n \n\n4.2. Materials and Methods  \n\n4.2.1. Study Area \n\nThe study area is located in the county of Campinas (22\u00b053? S, 46\u00b054? W), S\u00e3o Paulo State, \n\nSoutheast Brazil (Figure 1). The climate in this region is classified as Cwa according to the K\u00f6ppen \n\nclassification mean annual precipitation is 1,700 mm and mean annual temperature is 20 \u00b0C, with dry winters \n\nand wet summers [34]. Our study sites are located at the transition between the Atlantic Plateau and the \n\nPeripheral Depression geomorphological provinces [35]. The soils are classified as Ultisols [36] and the \n\noriginal vegetation in this area is a seasonal semi-deciduous forest, belonging to the Atlantic Forest biome. \n\nThis region is highly fragmented, because of 200 years of historical landscape changes [37]. In particular, \n\nour study area is located inside the sub-basin of the Atibaia River where the main land uses are native \n\nvegetation and pastureland, occupying 33% and 30% of the sub-basin, respectively. The native vegetation \n\nincludes Atlantic Forest remnants with different sizes and ages [38]. \n\n  \n\n\n\n54 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Location of the 18 study plots in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Southeast Brazil. \n\n \n\nWithin this area, we selected five land uses to measure soil physical and hydraulic properties, \n\nvegetation structure and diversity (Figure 2). In general, the deforestation of our study area already existed \n\nat the beginning of the 19th century, with the objective of introducing coffee (Coffea arabica) plantations. \n\nHowever, after the crisis in coffee cultivation during the early 20th century, the plantations were gradually \n\nreplaced by pastures. \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Pictures showing the vegetation cover and the Ultisol top-soil profile for each study site. The black lines in each top-soil \nprofile represent 0.2 m scale. RF, Reference Forest; APR, Assisted Passive Restoration; AR, Active Restoration; LiP, Low-\nintensity Pasture; HiP, High-intensity Pasture. \n\n \n\nLand use history for the study sites was reconstructed based on interviews with the local \n\npopulation and aerial photographs taken in 1968, 1978, 1994, 2005 and 2017. The RF site is a secondary \n\n\n\n55 \n \n\n \n \n\nold-growth forest characterized by having the highest slope between the study sites, which was 28.8 \u00b1 4.9% \n\n(SD). The slope was measured in the study plots with laser distance meter. Site RF was used as a control \n\narea to assess reference values for soil physical and hydraulic properties. According to interviews, in the \n\nearly 20th century, this site was affected by natural fire disturbances and it was partially cleared at least once \n\nin the past for agricultural purposes. Moreover, aerial photographs showed that forest cover in most of the \n\narea was established and has increased since 1968. In this context, all RF plots were located in sites with \n\nforest cover in the last 40 years. \n\nSite APR is located adjacent to the LiP. The slope (28.1 \u00b1 2.8%) was similar to the RF. From 1968 \n\nto 1994, it was used for milk cattle grazing. Then, the area was abandoned and remained without a specific \n\nland use until 2007, leaving the forest to naturally regrow over 12 years. In 2007, to decide the best \n\nrestoration strategy for the area, the \u201cDiagnostic\u201d protocol proposed by Rodrigues et al. [37] was \n\nimplemented. This protocol allowed identifying the initial environmental situation and evaluating the \n\npotential of autogenic restoration of the area. Considering that this site evidenced favorable abiotic and \n\nbiotic conditions (e.g., naturally regenerating native plants) for native plant establishment (Appendix C), the \n\nrestoration diagnosis was of fair potential for autogenic restoration. Thus, forest restoration techniques \n\nincluded the encouragement of regenerating individual native trees and shrubs by manual and chemical \n\ncontrol of invasive grasses. Moreover, enrichment plantings with native tree species were also implemented \n\nin patches without natural regeneration. In this regard, our measurements reflect the effect of 11 years of \n\nAPR on a soil with a previous second-growth forest. \n\nAt AR site, the slope (22.8 \u00b1 1.7%) was lower than the RF and APR. Initially, this site was used \n\nfor dairy cattle grazing from 1968 to 1986. Later, it was replaced by coffee plantations until 1994. It is \n\nimportant to emphasize that, at the beginning of the coffee plantation phase, widespread terracing was \n\nimplemented. Then, in 1994, the coffee was replaced by pastures with Urochloa brizantha for beef cattle \n\ngrazing. In 2007, the \u201cDiagnostic\u201d protocol mentioned previously was implemented. Given that AR site \n\nevidenced very few spontaneously regenerating seedlings and degraded environmental conditions that \n\nlimited the passive restoration strategy, the restoration diagnosis in this area was of very low potential for \n\nautogenic restoration. Thus, AR was implemented through a restoration model that aimed to provide \n\neconomical insurance and ensure successional processes to landowners [37]. Restoration plantings were \n\nimplemented as mixed plantation with high-diversity-mix of seedlings (>50 native trees species). During the \n\nplanting, these species were organized in fourth groups (e.g., initial, filling, middle and final species) \n\naccording to the rate of growth and commercial value. Initial species (e.g., Croton floribundus, Senegalia polyphylla \n\nand Schinus terebinthifolius) can be harvested for fuel production in 10\u201315 years, and are characteristically fast-\n\ngrowing, providing fast soil coverage and beneficial initial conditions for other species growth. Filling \n\nspecies (e.g., Croton urucurana, Gochnatia polymorpha and Trema micrantha) are also fast-growing species planted \n\nin the same line as the species. Middle species (e.g., Astronium graveolens, Gallesia integrifolia and Machaerium \n\nstipitatum) can be harvested during Years 20\u201325 and are more valuable wood species that will replace the \n\ninitial and filling species. Final species (e.g., Aspidosperma polyneuron, Cariniana estrellensis and Cariniana legalis) \n\n\n\n56 \n \n\nare narrow canopy and slow-growing species that can be harvested during Years 40\u201345 for luxury and \n\nfinished carpentry. The species planted are listed in Appendix D. The total density of seedling was 1,660 \n\nind\u00b7ha?1, in a 3 m \u00d7 2 m spacing, using mechanized soil preparation. Before planting, invasive grasses were \n\ncontrolled through herbicide application. Fertilizers and irrigation were applied at the time of planting and \n\nduring the first year [37,39]. The initial environmental conditions for AR are presented in Appendix E.  As \n\na result, our measurement in this restoration site represent the effect of 11 years of active restoration on \n\nhighly degraded soil, with an intense land use history. \n\nSite LiP with a slope of 22.7 \u00b1 2.1% is located adjacent to the HiP, and both sites share a similar \n\nland use history until 2008. Since this year, in the LiP, grazing has been intermittent and with low \n\nproductivity (e.g., stocking rate lower than two livestock units per hectare). During our field campaign, the \n\nvegetative cover in the LiP was dominated by the same grass species (U. brizantha), with a mean height about \n\n50 cm and isolated native trees, shrub species and non-native grasses scattered in the area were also evident \n\n(Figure 2). Consequently, our results reflect the influence of 40 years of grazing, with a lower land use \n\nintensity in the last decade. \n\nAt site HiP, the slope was 23.3 \u00b1 3.2%. This site was covered by a coffee plantation until 1968. \n\nAfterwards, the coffee was replaced by pasture, planting U. brizantha as grass species. Since 1978, this area \n\nhas been heavily grazed with dairy cattle, supporting a stocking rate greater than two livestock units per \n\nhectare, with regular application of fertilizers and other inputs. As a result, our measurements at this site \n\nrepresent the effect of 40 years of continuous grazing. \n\nA graphical summary of the land use history for the five land uses described previously is provided \n\nin Figure 3. \n\n \n\n\n\n57 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3. Land use history for each land use type. RF, Reference Forest; APR, Assisted Passive Restoration; AR, Active Restoration; \nLiP, Low-intensity Pasture; HiP, High-intensity Pasture. \n\n4.2.2. Experimental Design \n\nThe study sites were located in a similar landscape position along the hillslope gradient and were \n\nselected to have the same soil type following Zwartendijk et al. [23]. In forest stands, we established four \n\nplots, and for the pasture sites three plots were established. Sampling the same number of plots per land \n\nuses was impossible due the restricted accessibility in pasture sites, resulting in 18 plots altogether (Figure \n\n1). For sampling vegetation and soil attributes, the size of each plot was 500 m2 (50 m long and 10 m wide), \n\na total area of 2,000 m2 for each site. The size and number of plots were chosen according to similar \n\ninvestigations aimed at evaluating vegetation structure and composition in tropical forest restoration \n\nprojects [40\u201342]. \n\n4.2.3. Vegetation Sampling \n\nVegetation sampling was conducted from September to November 2017 in the RF, APR and AR \n\nplots. In each 500 m2 plot, we identified and sampled all living trees and shrubs with height ? 50 cm and \n\ndiameter at breast height (DBH) > 5 cm. Additionally, we installed a 200 m2 (50 m long and 4 m wide) \n\nsubplot at the center of each plot, to identify and measure all trees and shrubs with DBH &lt;5 cm and height \n\n? 50 cm. For all sites considered in this investigation, we measured the following vegetation attributes: (1) \n\ntree basal area; (2) canopy cover; (3) vegetation height; (4) tree density; and (5) species richness. These are \n\n\n\n58 \n \n\nkey ecological indicators, useful to evaluate vegetation structure and composition in tropical forest \n\nrestoration projects, also, they are being recommend in Atlantic Forest monitoring protocols [42,43]. As \n\nsuggested by Viani et al. [42], the percentage of canopy cover in each plot was measured by an adaptation \n\nof the line interception method [44], installing a 50 m line transect in the middle of each study plot. \n\nVegetation height was measured with a 5 m measuring stick, and the remaining height of trees taller than \n\nthis was estimated visually. As suggested by Suganuma and Durigan [40], for tree density, we analyzed: (1) \n\ndensity of trees (DBH > 5 cm); and (2) density of saplings (DBH 1\u20135 cm). In the same way, for species \n\nrichness, we analyzed: (1) total richness (all individual sampled); (2) overstory richness (DBH > 5 cm); and \n\n(3) richness of saplings (DBH 1\u20135 cm). For all previous ecological indicators, we calculated the mean values \n\nper study site. In addition, for all sampled individuals we classified the species origin as: native or nonnative \n\nto the study region. Specifically, in the AR site, we evaluated planted tree mortality. \n\n4.2.4. Soil Sampling \n\nSoil sampling was conducted during the dry season in April 2018. In the middle of each plot, we \n\ninstalled a 50 m transect along the hillslope gradient. At intervals of 15 m, three disturbed soil samples at 0\u2013\n\n5 cm depth were collected. Before soil sampling, the litter and a small layer of soil (e.g., organic horizon) of \n\nless than 1 cm was removed. We determined the soil particle size distribution (PSD) with sand particle \n\nseparation, the particle density (Pd) and soil organic carbon content (OC). The PSD analyses were carried \n\nout according to the hydrometer method [45]. Then, soil textures were classified following the USDA \n\nstandards. The Pd was determined using the helium gas pycnometer method [46], and the OC analyses were \n\nperformed following the Walkley\u2013Black method [47]. In the same transects, at 7 m intervals, soil hydraulic \n\nmeasurements were conducted. In the specific case of AR site, to minimize spatial variability and possible \n\ninduced effects by tillage, we placed the seven sampling points in the inter-plant space of planting lines. At \n\neach sampling point, we performed the Beerkan method [48,49]. A total of 126 Beerkan experiments were \n\ncarried out, using a steel ring with an inner diameter of 16 cm inserted to a depth of about 1 cm into the \n\nsoil surface. In each infiltration point, a known volume of water (150 mL) was repeatedly poured into the \n\ncylinder at a small height above soil surface (e.g., a few cm) and the energy of the water was dissipated with \n\nthe hand fingers to minimize the soil disturbance. Then, the time needed for complete infiltration was \n\nlogged. This procedure was repeated until the difference in infiltration time between two or three \n\nconsecutives trials became negligible. Following a procedure commonly used for Beerkan method, at the \n\nbeginning of each infiltration run, and near the steel ring, we collected one undisturbed soil core (100 cm3) \n\nat 0\u20135 cm depth to determine the bulk density (?b) and the initial volumetric soil water content (?i). Saturated \n\nsoil hydraulic conductivity (Ks) values were estimated by the Steady version of the Simplified method based \n\non a Beerkan Infiltration run (SSBI method) [50]. According to previous a investigation carried out by \n\nLozano-Baez et al. [28] on the same area, this method was chosen to avoid uncertainties due to a specific \n\nshape of the cumulative infiltration [51,52]. \n\n\n\n59 \n \n\n \n \n\nIn addition, the undisturbed soil cores were used to determine total soil porosity (Pt), soil \n\nmicroporosity (Mic) and soil macroporosity (Mac). The Pt was calculated using ?b and mean Pd of each plot \n\n[53]. The Mic was estimated using a tension table with application of 6 kPa suction, and Mac was obtained \n\nby the difference between Pt and Mic [54]. Finally, according to Lassabatere et al. [48], at the end of each \n\ninfiltration test, a disturbed soil sample was collected to determine the saturated gravimetric water content, \n\nand ?b was used to calculate the saturated volumetric soil water content (?s). \n\n4.2.5. Data Analysis \n\nThe hypothesis of normal distribution of both the raw and the log-transformed data was tested \n\nby the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed with raw or log-\n\ntransformed data. When ANOVA null hypothesis was rejected, we used multiple comparisons to detect \n\ndifferences between pairs by applying the Tukey\u2019s honestly significant difference test. The related p-values \n\nwere computed and compared to the level of significance of 0.05. Alternative non-parametric tests (Kruskal\u2013\n\nWallis ANOVA) were used when even the log-transformed data were non-normally distributed. In this case, \n\nwhen ANOVA null hypothesis was rejected, multiple comparisons between pairs were made with the \n\nBonferroni method (adjusted p-values). Variables means were calculated for soil attributes according to the \n\nstatistical distribution of the data, e.g., geometric mean for log-normal distributions and arithmetic means \n\nfor normal distributions [55]. According to Lee et al., the appropriate CV expression for a log-normal \n\ndistribution was calculated for the geometric means, and the usual CV was calculated for the arithmetic \n\nmeans [56]. Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient was calculated to identify correlation among the selected soil \n\nattributes: Pt, Mic, Mac, OC, ?i, ?b and Ks across all study sites. Furthermore, to compare the soil and \n\nvegetation attributes among land use types, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed on \n\nstandardized variables. All statistical analyses were carried out using the Minitab\u00a9 computer program \n\n(Minitab Inc., State College, PA, USA). \n\n \n\n4.3. Results \n\n4.3.1.  Vegetation Attributes \n\nA total of 541 saplings and 646 trees distributed in 38 families, 92 genera, and 138 species were \n\nsampled. For non-native species, we found 62 saplings and 147 trees, representing 11% and 23% of the \n\ntotal, respectively (Appendix F and Appendix G). Although the basal area and vegetation height of trees \n\nwere much higher in RF, these did not differ statistically with both restored forests. The canopy cover \n\nshowed significant differences in AR with RF and APR. We highlight the higher similarity between RF and \n\nAPR for density of trees and saplings (Table 1), as a result of the high density of non-native trees Psidium \n\nguajava and Tecoma stans, which represented 24% and 5% of trees in APR, respectively. In contrast, non-\n\n\n\n60 \n \n\nnative trees in the RF and AR represented 18% and 16%, respectively, of all tree individuals sampled in each \n\nsite. Additionally, the total richness, the density and richness of trees and saplings were markedly lower in \n\nAR, where 14% of planted trees (e.g., initial species) were dead yet there was a higher presence of grasses \n\n(e.g., U. brizantha) observed in all plots. \n\n \n\nTable 1.

Soil Physical and Hydraulic Properties \n\nThe texture of the upper layers of the soil (0\u20135 cm) was clay loam in APR and pasture sites, while \n\nit was sandy clay loam in RF and AR sites. The clay content at the study sites ranged between 21% and 44%, \n\nbut only the RF with lower values of clay differed significantly from the other study sites. Moreover, soil \n\nsamples taken from the HiP showed the highest clay content. The silt ranged between 18% and 37%, with \n\nhigher silt values in APR that differed significantly from other land-covers. The sand content varied between \n\n31% and 55%, and was significantly lower in APR compared with other study sites (Table 2). \n\nTable 2.

Different superscript \n\nletters denote statistically significant differences between land use types, according to the Tukey\u2019s test (p &lt;0.05). \n\n \nComparisons of ?b values between study sites revealed higher similarity between RF and APR, \n\nwhile AR presented similar ?b values with both pasture sites. The Pd had similar values in all study sites, \n\nranging from 2.61 to 2.71 g cm?3. The OC varied significantly among sites (from 4.6 to 25.6 g kg?1), with \n\n\n\n61 \n \n\n \n \n\nhigher values in HiP and markedly lower values in AR. The soil Mac ranged from 0.16 to 0.38 cm3 cm?3, \n\nwith greater values observed in RF, followed by the APR, AR, LiP and HiP. Similar results were obtained \n\nfor Pt, which varied from 0.48 to 0.66 cm3 cm?3. In contrast, the soil Mic (from 0.21 to 0.43 cm3 cm?3) was \n\nmuch higher in pasture sites and decreased in forest land-covers, with lower values in RF and AR. In \n\naddition, the ?i at the time of the Beerkan infiltration run varied between 0.12 and 0.32 cm3 cm?3, with \n\nsignificant lower values in the RF.

The higher Ks was evidenced in APR, which was only similar with RF and significantly different from \n\nother three land uses. The Ks values obtained in the RF were lower than APR. In contrast, the Ks of AR \n\nbetween 15 and 1,121 mm h?1 was similar to RF and differed significantly for the other three land uses.

In contrast, smaller variations were evidenced in pasture sites. Figure 4 includes the results of \n\nthe of the Tukey\u2019s test for all sampled plots. The grouping information highlights the significant and non-\n\nsignificant comparisons for all sampled plots. In the first group, the forest plots evidenced not significant \n\ndifferences due to the high Ks variability within these plots (e.g., Ks means from 104 to 407 mm h\u20131). Then, \n\nthe second group (RF1, RF3, RF4, AR1, AR3, LiP1 and LiP2) showed significant differences with pasture \n\nsites, which were grouped in a third (LiP1, LiP2, LiP3, HiP1 and HiP2) and fourth group (LiP3, HiP1, HiP2 \n\n\n\n62 \n \n\nand HiP3). In general, the LiP and HiP plots were similar, and mean Ks values altogether (e.g., from 8 to 47 \n\nmm h\u20131) were very low (Figure 4). \n\n \n\nFigure 4. Ks at the surface by individual plots.

In contrast, \n\nsignificant negative correlations were found for ?b vs. Pt (?0.99), ?b vs. Mac (?0.58) and Ks vs. Mic (?0.49) \n\n(Appendix H). \n\nThe first and second axis of the PCA for the soil attributes explained 43.0% and 29.3%, \n\nrespectively, of the variation among all study sites. This analysis revealed a gradient of land-cover types from \n\npastures to forest covers. As expected, the pasture sites were separated from the forest covers due to the \n\nhigher Mic and ?b. Similarly, the higher ?b values in AR plots contributed to separating the study site. Then, \n\nAPR plots were more similar to RF plots, and both forest covers were associated with higher Ks, Mac, Pt, ?i \n\nand OC values (Figure 5A). The PCA correlating the soil and vegetation attributes showed a clear segregation \n\namong forest cover sites, explaining 55.2% and 16.5% of the variation in the first and second axis, \n\nrespectively. This analysis showed that RF plots were mainly related with larger trees, evidencing higher \n\ncorrelation with vegetation attributes such as height of trees, density of saplings, basal area, canopy cover \n\nand overstory richness, also it was evidenced intermediate values of Mic. Considering the vegetation \n\nattributes in APR plots, the PCA showed positive correlation with total richness of species, density of trees \n\nand richness of saplings, also positive correlation and higher values of Ks, ?i, Mac and Pt were found in these \n\nplots. By contrast, the separation of AR plots was driven by the higher ?b values and lower vegetation \n\nattributes, since AR site had a more intensive land use history compared to RF and APR sites. In particular, \n\namong AR plots, AR3 was the most different plot, composed by few and smaller trees growing in a \n\ncompacted soil (Figure 5B). \n\n\n\n63 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.

Discussion \n\n4.4.1.  Effects of Land-Cover Type and Land Use History on Soil Physical and Hydraulic \n\nProperties \n\nAssessing the Ks recovery, soil physical and hydraulic properties of different forest restoration \n\nstrategies, and investigating their relationships with land use history, vegetation structure and composition, \n\nprovided the opportunity to identify the extent to which these forest restoration strategies contribute to \n\nsupplying ecosystem functions as infiltration of rainwater. The variation of Ks among land-cover types was \n\nnot as we expected, due to the higher Ks evidenced in APR and lower in RF. However, our results supported \n\nthe first study hypothesis, namely that a more intensive land use history in AR resulted in a lower Ks recovery \n\ncompared to APR. Importantly, despite both restored forest types being located in the same soil type and \n\nlandscape position, it was not clear from our measurements whether APR resulted in a faster recovery of Ks \n\ncompared to AR, due to the high variability in land use history. Similar situations have been reported in \n\nseveral tropical studies [26,29]. In addition, the Ks recovery in APR could be associated with improved soil \n\nphysical and hydraulic properties, which suggest a higher soil pore connectivity. Hassler et al. [12] found \n\nsimilar Ks at 0\u20136 cm depth between 100-year-old and 12\u201315-year-old secondary forests in Panama. Similarly, \n\nLeite et al. [24], at Brazilian Caatinga, obtained no significant differences for surface Ks between old-growth \n\nforest (more than 55 years) and young secondary forest (7 years). This Ks recovery to pre-pasture levels was \n\nalso detected at 12.5 cm depth after 15 years of pasture abandonment for an Oxisol in the Brazilian Amazon \n\n[11] and by other studies carried out in tropical environments [20,21]. In contrast, after 10 years of natural \n\n\n\n64 \n \n\nregeneration in Ecuador, no significant changes of Ks were reported at 12.5 cm depth for an Inceptisol, \n\nwhich was related with invasive species delaying the Ks recovery [33]. \n\nOur Ks in the RF plots can be compared with those for Lozano-Baez et al. [28], as both \n\ninvestigations in the same forest biome estimated the Ks with the SSBI method, on the same soil texture \n\n(e.g., sandy clay loam) and at the same soil depth used an identical measurement technique (e.g., Beerkan \n\nmethod) and instruments. Our mean Ks in the RF (215 mm h?1) was close to reported value (387 mm h?1) \n\nby Lozano-Baez et al. [28] under similar soil conditions. This difference can be explained by the more \n\nconserved soil conditions in the study area of Lozano-Baez et al. [28], for example, as their remnant forest \n\nwas never burned or cultivated. In contrast, our RF was partially cleared and was affected by natural fire \n\ndisturbances. This observation is in line with several studies, which suggest that in old-growth tropical \n\nforests the Ks can be affected by past soil degradation and intensity of forest use [11,15,29,57]. The Ks values \n\nobtained in RF plots (e.g., from 23 to 1,122 mm h?1) showed the high spatial variability of the infiltration \n\nprocess under forest cover, which can be associated with the heterogeneous soil structure, lower ?b and \n\nhigher Mac [57\u201359]. Another factor to consider is the spatial heterogeneity of our RF, where different \n\nlandscape conditions such as higher slope and vegetation attributes among sample plots could have \n\ninfluenced the Ks variability. In this sense, we believe that the true reference soil condition could be \n\nrepresented by RF plot RF2, due to observed low soil disturbance in this plot, which is consistent with the \n\nhigher tree basal area (39.4 m2 ha?1), vegetation height (average of 12.9 m), species richness (41 trees and \n\nnon-tree; Table 1 and Appendix I), OC and soil porosity (Table 3 and Appendix J). Unfortunately, it was \n\nnot possible to find similar forests in the study area, but we could expect that infiltration capacity in other \n\nBrazilian Atlantic Forest patches will be directly related with the forest age and forest conditions, which has \n\nbeen shown by several studies [12,24,60]. Therefore, the Ks values in RF could be limited by the number of \n\nmeasurements (n = 28), which should be increased in future studies, considering the gradient and spatial \n\nheterogeneity of forest cover. \n\nOur results highlight the importance of land use legacy on Ks recovery during forest restoration. \n\nThe restoration diagnosis in APR and AR based on the \u201cDiagnostic\u201d protocol [37], allowed evidencing \n\nsignificant differences in the initial environmental situations (e.g., naturally regenerating native plants) and \n\nland use history between both sites. In fact, the initial differences in the initial environmental situations in \n\neach restored site allowed the restoration practitioners to identify and select at the beginning of the \n\nrestoration project the most suitable restoration strategy. Figure 3 provides a graphical summary of these \n\ndifferences between APR and AR. Our findings are also in agreement with other studies that reported lower \n\nKs when land use was more intense prior to forest regrowth [11,21,27]. In this sense, our AR site with a \n\nmore intensive land use history, resulted in significant lower Ks, which could be attributed mainly to greater \n\nsoil exposure and soil compaction during the land use history. Our mean Ks in the AR site (163 mm h?1) \n\nwas considerably higher than the reported value (54 mm h?1) by Lozano-Baez et al. [28] on the same soil \n\ntexture (e.g., sandy clay loam). This difference can be explained by the higher ?b values found in the actively \n\nrestored forest of Lozano-Baez et al. [28]. \n\n\n\n65 \n \n\n \n \n\nDespite no statistically significant differences being found between AR and other forest plots, we \n\nstress that the specific past land use intensity and management in each plot could also have played an \n\nimportant role in soil degradation. Thus, we found AR plots (AR1 and AR3), where the Ks values were \n\nbelow the mean of other forest plots. The lower Ks in these plots are consistent with their higher ?b and Mic, \n\nlower Mac and OC (Appendix J) and possibly a more intensive past management, suggesting that these plots \n\nstill retain the \u201cmemory\u201d from the previous land use. Similar results have been reported by Bonell et al. [26], \n\nfor a 10-year-old Acacia plantation in India growing in Ultisols and Oxisols, with lower Ks when compared \n\nto less disturbed forests. On the other hand, the higher Ks in restored plots AR2 and AR4 is closer to the \n\nRF and APR plots, indicating that in some cases after 11 years the active restoration could reach the \n\ninfiltration recovery target defined by the reference conditions. This finding agrees with recent literature \n\nreviews, which show that Ks recovery after tree planting in the tropics occur across a wide range of soil \n\nconditions [61,62] and probably after more than one decade [26,33]. In addition, it is important to \n\nunderscore that before tree planting at AR site, trampling pressure occurred for 13 years over abandoned \n\nagricultural terraces, causing terracing failure. Several previous studies have reported an increase in soil loss, \n\nsurface runoff, ?b and reduction of infiltration rates after terrace abandoning [63,64]. Another important \n\nfactor that might have influenced the current Ks in AR site is the possible soil compaction during soil \n\npreparation, tree planting using bulldozers or tractors is associated with high levels of soil disturbance, and \n\nthe effects of this soil preparation can persist long after tree planting [65]. Overall, these circumstances \n\nsuggest that initial soil conditions before forest restoration actions at AR site were more degraded than in \n\nAPR. Nevertheless, in our study the lack of soil measurements in each moment of the land use history \n\nprecludes a stronger understanding of the relative impacts of historical land management on Ks recovery, \n\nthus future studies should consider the role of previous land use, comparing sites with a truly identical \n\nhistory. \n\nThe significantly lower Ks observed in pasture sites compared to forest land-cover types was \n\nconsistent with several previous studies [20,33,66], supporting the importance of preserving the forest cover \n\nand promoting forest restoration actions in the landscape to maintain the infiltration process. This result \n\ncan be attributed to higher ?b and Mic in both pasture sites (Table 3). In the present study, we observed a \n\nsignificant higher Ks in the LiP compared to HiP. The differences in Ks between LiP and HiP are mainly \n\nrelated to factors such as cattle-grazing intensity and the duration of pasture cover, which has been similarly \n\nreported in several other tropical studies [11,12,66]. Additionally, the similar OC between pasture sites and \n\nforest covers (RF and APR) is a trend that has been previously noted by other authors [9,22,28,67], \n\nsuggesting that such similarities are linked to the accumulation of organic matter by the root system of \n\ngrasses, the animal-derived inputs and application of fertilizers. \n\n4.4.2.  Relationships between Soil, Vegetation and Land Use History \n\nWhen evaluating vegetation attributes in forest cover sites, our study revealed the significantly \n\nlower values in AR and higher values in RF. The higher values of vegetation attributes in the RF could be \n\n\n\n66 \n \n\nexplained as a consequence of the longer time that this old-growth forest (Figure 3) has remained \n\nundisturbed [68,69]. It is interesting to note that basal area and vegetation height of trees in AR could reach \n\nstatistically similar values to the RF. Similarly, Garcia et al. [70] found in the same biome no significant \n\ndifferences in the basal area between actively restored forests (12, 23 and 55 years old) and the reference \n\ncondition. Furthermore, it is noteworthy in AR that, while Ks, basal area and vegetation height of trees have \n\nreached statistically similar values with the RF, other vegetation attributes, such as canopy cover, tree density \n\nand species richness, were significantly lower than those for the RF plots. For instance, the lower canopy \n\ncover, density and richness of saplings (e.g., lack of regenerating trees) in AR might compromise the future \n\nforest structure [68], which could hamper the recovery of soil hydraulic properties [62]. Although the \n\nherbaceous cover was not directly quantified, we observed a higher abundance of grasses (e.g., U. brizantha) \n\nin AR site, which could be related to the lower canopy cover. The open canopy conditions in AR may have \n\nfavored the persistence of grasses, hindering the recruitment of new trees species [71]. In contrast, APR site \n\nhad statistically similar Ks (Figure 4) and vegetation attributes to the RF (Table 1). However, the vegetation \n\nattributes in APR were mainly influenced by non-native trees, such as P. guajava, an aggressive pioneer \n\nspecies with allelopathic potential [72]. For these reasons, we suggest that both restored forests need \n\nmanagement activities to improve soil and vegetation attributes. Canopy cover protects the soil from \n\nphysical disturbance, and higher species richness and tree density with native species can produce a higher \n\nbiomass and enhance the Ks [73,74]. \n\nOne possible explanation for the different outputs between AR and APR are the initial soil \n\nconditions at each site. As mentioned above, when the forest restoration actions began in APR, the soil \n\nmight have had better initial conditions (lower ?b, higher Ks, OC and soil porosity), and some degree of \n\nnatural regeneration, which stimulated the potential recovery of the site and facilitating the recruitment of \n\nnew trees species [3,37]. In AR site, the more intensive land use history probably led to an area with low \n\nresilience, a more compacted soil and poor OC. In particular, the intensity of past land use has been reported \n\nas the main factor affecting tropical forest recovery, for example, the vegetation in pastures with a long-\n\nlasting land use will regenerate more slowly relative to pastures used less intensively [75,76]. Both restoration \n\napproaches (APR and AR) have an important role in the process of restoring degraded ecosystems in \n\ntropical landscapes and can be used complementary to enhance the chances of restoration success [37,68]. \n\nTo understand the soil hydraulic recovery after forest restoration, it is important that future studies consider \n\nthe role of the duration and intensity of the previous land use, including parameters to assess the land use \n\nlegacy effects [11,77] and more measurements over time in deeper soil layers, which may reveal further \n\ndifferences among restoration strategies. \n\nThe correlation results for Pt vs. Mac and Ks vs. Mac are in agreement with several other studies in \n\nthe Atlantic Forest [30,58], which reported the positive influence of Mac for the pore space and infiltration \n\nprocess. This finding is consistent with the inverse relationships between Ks vs. ?b, Ks vs. Mic and Mac vs. ?b, \n\nalso found by some studies [9,23,28,78]. High OC contributes to the trend of increasing Ks, soil porosity and \n\nreducing ?b values [9]. However, the reverse occurred in the present study, which can be attributed to the \n\nhigh OC and ?b in pastures sites as well as low OC in AR but with a high Ks, suggesting that recovery of soil \n\n\n\n67 \n \n\n \n \n\nphysical and hydraulic properties is not only dependent on the OC. The result of the PCA indicate the \n\nimportance of forest cover to promote the infiltration and better soil physical and hydraulic properties. This \n\ncould be associated with the litter inputs, roots and higher soil faunal activity produced by the trees, which \n\ncan influence positively the aggregate stability, Mac and OC, thereby Ks increase in forest covers [79,80]. \n\nNevertheless, there is a need to further research the plant\u2013soil interactions; for example, little attention has \n\nbeen paid to the effects of individual trees, richness and density of species on Ks and soil hydraulic properties \n\n[80]. \n\n \n\n4.5. Conclusions \n\nThe Ks recovery differed between AR and APR sites. As we expected, the knowledge of the land \n\nuse history was crucial for understanding the current differences among the study sites for Ks, soil physical \n\nand hydraulic properties. This is consistent with our previous work [28] in the same forest restoration \n\nprogram. The Ks and vegetation attributes decreased when land use was more intense prior to forest \n\nrestoration actions. The influence of land use intensity on soil physical and hydraulic properties could also \n\nbe evidenced in the comparison between LiP and HiP. The present results further illustrate the positive \n\ncorrelation between Ks and vegetation attributes (tree basal area, vegetation height of trees and overstory \n\nrichness) in forests undergoing restoration. \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n1.

FINAL CONSIDERATIONS \n\nAlthough the importance of soil for forest restoration has been pointed by several studies, it is \n\nclear that soil is still regarded as a \u201cblack box\u201d by restoration practitioners around the world. In line with \n\nprevious studies and to continue opening this \u201cblack box\u201d, our work contributed to understand the effects \n\nof forest restoration on the recovery of soil physical and hydraulic properties, more specifically on water \n\ninfiltration. In the first part of the study (Chapter 2), with a systematic review of scientific literature, we \n\nshowed that infiltration was likely to increase in many tropical forests restored by tree planting; that \n\ninfiltration recovery could be faster when the agriculture was the prior land use; that clayey soils (>30% \n\nclay) trended to exhibit greater increases in infiltration after tree planting; and that restored forests after 10 \n\nyears evidenced more similar infiltration values with the pre-disturbance soil conditions. In the second part \n\n(Chapter 3), our study was carried out in a study area with great soil variability. To overcome this soil \n\nvariability, we compared sites with similar soil textural classes in the surface horizon. In this context, our \n\nresults showed two actively restored forests with marked differences in soil physical and hydraulic \n\nproperties. In the first situation, the soil recovery could reach similar values to the pre-disturbance soil \n\nconditions. In the second situation, the soil recovery was not evidenced, and soil attributes were similar to \n\npasture sites. Consequently, the hypothesis that forest restoration can recover the surface Ks to the pre-\n\ndisturbance soil conditions was not supported for both restored forest sites. In addition, the different soil \n\nresponses in both restored forests could be related to many factors (e.g., topographic variations, soil texture, \n\nland use history, density and diversity of plants, among others). In order to understand and interpret \n\nadequately the influence of these factor on soil physical and hydraulic properties after forest restoration, in \n\nthe last part (Chapter 4), a more rigorous experiment was designed to capture the least possible soil variation. \n\nIn this part, we also compared the soil and vegetation recovery of active vs. assisted passive restoration \n\nstrategies. As we expected, the active restoration site with a more intensive land use history, evidenced lower \n\nKs recovery, soil and vegetation attributes. Our findings also indicated the positive correlation between Ks \n\nand vegetation attributes. In this respect it is important to highlight the role of vegetation attributes used in \n\nAtlantic Forest monitoring protocols, these vegetation attributes could reflect the good or poor soil \n\nconditions in forests undergoing restoration. \n\nBased on the research findings of this thesis, we concluded that forest restoration actions may \n\nimprove soil physical and hydraulic properties, but in some cases a complete recovery to reference levels \n\ncan be difficult, especially when land use was more intense prior to forest restoration actions. Thus, we \n\nsuggest that management activities should be implemented before and during forest restoration to avoid \n\nsoil compaction and guarantee the soil recovery. Results reported here also indicated that pasture land use \n\naffects drastically the soil physical and hydraulic properties, therefore, it is highly recommended to \n\nimplement best land management practices (e.g., rotational grazing and introduction of silvopastoral \n\nsystems) to avoid the negative effects on the pastures. Our results have shown that more studies are needed \n\nto understand how infiltration and soil recovery occurs in both actively and passively restored forests. It \n\n\n\n76 \n \n\nwould be very interesting to study the soil recovery in forest undergoing restoration on different climates, \n\nforests and soils types. In this sense, there are important challenges to be addressed, for example, assessing \n\nthe water movement through the soil profile. Most studies have focused on top-soil, and only few \n\ninvestigations have analyzed the effect of forest restoration on deeper soil layers. Other research priority is \n\nto determine the rates and extents, which forest restoration is recovery the infiltration process. In this regard, \n\nit is important to highlight that most research is focusing in young restored forest for measuring soil physical \n\nand hydraulic properties, if these results are extrapolated could create misleading conclusions, thus long-\n\nterm studies with replication in time (e.g., undergoing restoration forests with different ages) are also \n\nnecessary. Considering that hydrological processes occur in the landscape, it would be relevant upscaling \n\nthe infiltration plot measurements to catchment level and investigating the relationships with other \n\nhydrological processes (e.g., groundwater recharge, surface runoff, evaporation among other). Future \n\nresearches are also needed to understand the effects of individual trees, richness and density of species on \n\nsoil physical and hydraulic properties. Finally, the role that water infiltration can have for the water quality \n\ndeserve more attention. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n77 \n \n\n \n \n\nAPPENDICES \n\nAPPENDIX A.
