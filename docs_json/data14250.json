This process has been hastened in \n\nrecent decades through nutrient input from several human activities, posing a threat to \n\nsuch systems from eutrophication. The major cause is the delivery of high quantities of \n\nnitrogen and phosphorus, important plant growth promoting nutrients, to these systems. \n\nVarious definitions of the term \u2018eutrophication\u2019 imply the biological symptoms to be \n\nmonitored for, and management responses to prevent/mitigate this development take \n\ninto account approaches for reducing nutrient input, especially that of nitrogen and \n\nphosphorus. Nitrogen and phosphorus budget analyses can be used to determine the \n\neffectiveness of these management responses, and also the relative importance of \n\ndifferent input sources. These analyses, used along with carbon, salt, and water budget \n\ndata, can also indicate the system\u2019s primary productivity, and therefore its carrying \n\ncapacity for economic ventures such as aquaculture. Though being subject to \n\nuncertainties, budgets should be used to promote discussion and not as bases for policy \n\nformulation.  \n\n \n\nKeywords: eutrophication, coastal aquatic systems, nutrient budgets, nitrogen, \n\nphosphorus, management \n\n\n\n vi\n\nCO?TE?TS \n\n \n\nSection Page \n\n  \n\nSummary 1 \n\n  \n\nChapter 1: Introduction 5 \n\n  \n\nChapter 2: Eutrophication 8 \n\n2.1 Eutrophication \u2013 definitions and effects 8 \n\n2.2 Nitrogen, phosphorus, and eutrophication of coastal systems 13 \n\n2.3 Hypoxia and anoxia 18 \n\n2.4 Impacts of climate on coastal eutrophication 20 \n\n2.5 Assessment of eutrophication 21 \n\n  \n\nChapter 3: Drivers of nutrient loading, and regime shifts in coastal \n\necosystems \n\n24 \n\n3.1 Drivers of nutrient loading 24 \n\n3.1.1 Drivers of nitrogen loading 25 \n\n3.1.2 Drivers of phosphorus loading 28 \n\n3.2 Regime shifts 30 \n\n  \n\nChapter 4: Management responses 32 \n\n4.1 Budgets as a tool in nutrient management 33 \n\n4.2 General approaches to system management 34 \n\n\n\n vii\n\n4.2.1 Monitoring methods 35 \n\n4.2.2 Technological responses 36 \n\n4.2.3 Policy responses 37 \n\n4.3 Improvement of nutrient use efficiency in agroecosystems 38 \n\n4.4 Technical approaches for the control of nitrogen loads from watersheds 39 \n\n4.5 Technical approaches for the removal of phosphorus from wastewaters 43 \n\n4.6 Mariculture waste management 45 \n\n4.6.1 Ecological engineering of mariculture 45 \n\n4.6.2 Integrated multitrophic aquaculture (IMTA) 46 \n\n4.6.3 Biofiltration by plants 48 \n\n  \n\nChapter 5: Overview of LOICZ Budgets Database and Case Studies 50 \n\n5.1 An overview of the LOICZ budgets database 50 \n\n5.2 New developments in the use of nutrient budgets 53 \n\n5.2.1 Application to muddy systems 53 \n\n5.2.2 Link to ASSETS 54 \n\n5.2.3 Link to conceptual diagrams 54 \n\n5.2.4 Link to fisheries 55 \n\n5.3 Case study: S\u2019Ena Arrubia lagoon, Italy 55 \n\n5.4 Case study: Sacca di Goro lagoon, Italy 58 \n\n5.5 Case study: Budget analysis for the Mandovi estuary \u2013 Goa, India 62 \n\n5.5.1 Water and salt balances 65 \n\n5.5.2 Budgets of nonconservative materials 65 \n\n5.5.3 Management of nutrient enrichment 66 \n\n  \n\n\n\n viii\n\nChapter 6: Bibliography 70 \n\n  \n\nBibliography 75 \n\n \n\n\n\n 1\n\nSUMMARY \n\n \n\nThe addition of nutrients to coastal aquatic systems is a natural process that occurs from \n\ngeological weathering and inputs from ocean upwelling events. In recent decades, this \n\nprocess has been hastened by various human activities, through the elevated nutrient \n\nloading especially of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) compounds, resulting in \n\neutrophication.  \n\n \n\nEutrophication has been variously defined by several workers, and has implications in \n\nthe monitoring of systems. It has been understood as the following:  \n\nEutrophication is an active change in the metabolic resources of a system that results \n\nthrough its fertilisation with previously scarce nutrients (N and P) that causes an \n\nincrease in organic content. This process can also occur through the delivery of \n\ndecomposable organic matter, though less commonly. A deviation is caused in the \n\nstructure, function, and stability of the inhabitant organisms. Phanerogams are replaced \n\nby short-lived nuisance macroalgae or phytoplankton, with concurrently higher \n\nchlorophyll a concentrations. Shifts also occur in the algal and benthic communities. \n\nTurbidity and low dissolved oxygen content are other symptoms. These changes are \n\nundesirable as they decrease the human benefits that are gained from such ecosystems. \n\nThe effects of this condition are now on the rise, and have large-scale implications. \n\n \n\nN loads are critical in influencing the extent of eutrophy in an ecosystem as it is \n\ngenerally the limiting nutrient in coastal waters. On the other hand, in some systems or \n\nseasons, P may be the limiting nutrient. With anthropogenic nutrient loading, increases \n\nin organic matter content can cause the sediments to become more reducing in nature, \n\n\n\n 2\n\nthus releasing higher quantities than usual of P into the water column. This can increase \n\nthe likelihood of N limitation of the system with increased nutrient loading. \n\n \n\nGlobal warming can intensify the effects of eutrophication: elevated temperatures, \n\nassociated with climate change, reduce the capacity of the water to hold dissolved \n\noxygen, and increase the diversity of species that occupy coastal waters. \n\n \n\nBricker et al (1999, 2007) have classified estuarine ecosystems based on primary \n\nsymptoms (chlorophyll a and macroalgal abundance) and secondary symptoms (low \n\ndissolved oxygen, loss of phanerogams, and nuisance/toxic algal blooms), and eutrophic \n\nconditions rated from low to high based on scores assigned to the primary and \n\nsecondary symptoms. Rabalais (2002) has described the changes that occur in marine \n\necosystems, where the symptoms are similar as those in estuarine systems, but does not \n\noccur by degrees, but rather is stepwise with sudden shifts. \n\n \n\nNutrient loading of N and P has several drivers such as the high use of synthetic \n\nfertiliser, atmospheric deposition, agriculture (including wastes and runoff), wastewater, \n\nand mariculture. The time that elapses between the pressures on the system and \n\nrestoration may cause changes in baselines that make the system deviate from simply \n\nreverting from the changes encountered during the eutrophication phase. The \n\npresumption that management can return the system to its \u201cpristine\u201d state should be \n\nreplaced by targets that securely perpetuate key ecosystem functions, and hence the \n\nsteady supply of benefits to society. Management responses that take these \n\nconsiderations into account can be evaluated by budgeting exercises, a useful \n\nframework in this regard. \n\n\n\n 3\n\n \n\nManagement strategies have to take into account a monitoring plan. Efforts have to be \n\nput into reducing N and P input from point and nonpoint sources such as \n\nagroecosystems, animal production, fossil fuel consumption, urban and suburban \n\nsources, and wastewaters. Natural sinks (wetlands) should be enhanced. Mariculture, \n\nwhich has been encouraged to supplement declining wild fisheries, is another source \n\nwhose waste can be controlled through ecological engineering methods, multitrophic \n\naquaculture, and biofiltration utilising plants. \n\n \n\nBudgeting exercises stimulate thought about the fluxes and drivers of the state of a \n\nsystem and the relative importance of the various nutrient sources and sinks in the \n\nsystem. They can be used to determine the efficiency of management plans and find use \n\nas environmental indicators of nutrient use efficiency, and are therefore useful in policy \n\nand regulation. Nutrient budgets, along with salt, water, and carbon budgets, also finds \n\nuse in aquaculture management. \n\n \n\nNutrient budgets are simple and flexible, but are subject to uncertainty from various \n\nsources. To minimise inconsistencies and uncertainties when analysing and interpreting \n\nnutrient budgets, it is advisable to observe standard data conventions and guidelines, to \n\nutilise established datasets of known quality (where available), and to employ consistent \n\nmethodology for evaluating budgets and their components. \n\n \n\nThe \u201csnapshot\u201d analysis that is often used in budget studies may not have much value in \n\nthe real world as they can present a fixed view of the situation as opposed to average \n\nbehaviour or trends relevant to management, and so should be reappraised over several \n\n\n\n 4\n\nyears. They should not be viewed as final statements on which policies can be made, but \n\nshould be used to promote discussion, bringing assumptions and uncertainties to the \n\nforefront. \n\n\n\n 5\n\nCHAPTER 1: I?TRODUCTIO? \n\n \n\nThis thesis is in partial fulfilment of the academic requirements of the Erasmus Mundus \n\nMaster in Water and Coastal Management. The topic chosen is appropriate because it \n\ndescribes several interpretations of the term \u2018eutrophication\u2019, and the symptoms and \n\nconditions that occur in this process. It also reviews the use of nutrient budgets in \n\nevaluating the success of strategies for the management of coastal aquatic systems to \n\nmitigate and/or prevent the occurrence and or effects of eutrophication. \n\n \n\nThe addition of nutrients to aquatic systems occurs naturally from geological \n\nweathering and due to inputs from ocean upwelling. However, in recent decades, a large \n\ngrowth of populations has occurred and related nutrient sources, such as agriculture, \n\nwastewater treatment plants, urban runoff, fossil fuel utilisation (atmospheric \n\ndeposition), have increased nutrient inputs (of especially nitrogen and phosphorus) to \n\nthese systems to several times their natural levels, hastening eutrophication (Bricker et \n\nal 1999, 2007). Nutrient additions are a threat to biota, as well as to the human benefits \n\nobtained from these resources like aesthetics, fishing opportunities and success, tourism, \n\nand real estate value (Bricker et al 2007). \n\n \n\nBesides nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), other nutrients such as carbon and silica may \n\naffect the onset of symptoms, but their role is not well understood. Apart from increased \n\nnutrient loads, other human and natural influences may affect the expression of \n\neutrophic symptoms. These include engineered water flow, development, dedging, \n\noverfishing and disease. Climate change may also have a role in the development of \n\neutrophication symptoms. (Bricker et al 1999, 2007). The term \u2018eutrophication\u2019 has \n\n\n\n 6\n\nbeen variously defined, and these definitions list the symptoms and conditions to be \n\nmonitored for in susceptible systems. \n\n \n\nA precise quantitative framework of N and P and other nutrients in a system can be \n\nprovided by nutrient budgets. Budgets are mass balance predictions of variables such as \n\nN and P within defined geographic areas and fixed durations of time (Oenema et al \n\n2003, Artioli et al 2008). They are based on the principle that matter can neither be \n\ncreated nor destroyed. Budgets utilise simple accounting criteria and have moderate \n\ndata requirements (\u00d6born et al 2003, Swaney et al 2008). From such budget \n\ncalculations, information is obtained with regard to the rate of delivery and removal of \n\nmaterial (N or P) to/from the system under study, and in this way it illustrates how \n\nmaterial mass changes within a system (\u00d6born et al 2003, Artioli et al 2008; Swaney et \n\nal 2008).  \n\n \n\nNutrient budgets present a wide perspective from which the importance of various \n\nprocesses that occur within a system can be assessed more effectively (Nixon 1981). It \n\nis a useful tool in the analysis of eutrophication as it allows the determination of the \n\nvarious external sources of nutrient input to coastal systems (which are the main cause) \n\nand their relative importance in terms of content, and also the system\u2019s internal \n\nbiogeochemistry and water exchange (Artioli et al 2008).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 7\n\nObjectives \n\n \n\nThe aims of this thesis are \n\n \n\n1. To gain an understanding of the occurrence of eutrophication. \n\n2. To understand the role of nutrients, especially N and P, in this process. \n\n3. To highlight the utility of nutrient budgets as a tool in the management of \n\nsensitive or eutrophied coastal aquatic systems, and the measures that can be \n\nused towards prevention or mitigation of nutrient enrichment. \n\n \n\n\n\n 8\n\nCHAPTER 2: EUTROPHICATIO? \n\n \n\n2.1 Eutrophication \u2013 definitions and effects \n\n \n\nThe word \u2018eutrophication\u2019 has its origins in the Greek language, where \u2018eu\u2019 signifies \n\n\u2018well\u2019, and \u2018trope\u2019 means nourishment (\u00c6rtebjerg et al 2003, Andersen et al 2006). In \n\nrecent years, taking a more modern standpoint, eutrophication has come to be associated \n\nwith the traits of ecosystem sensitivity. There is no single established threshold for \n\neutrophication in terms of primary production; the threshold varies with variations in \n\nabiotic factors, including climate (Cognetti, 2001). Several workers as described below \n\nhave variously defined eutrophication: \n\n \n\nNixon (1995) characterised eutrophication as being an increase in the rate of supply \n\nof organic matter to an ecosystem, and emphasised that it is an active process of the \n\nchange in metabolic resources on the whole and not of a trophic state. Nixon (2009) \n\ndoes not assume a stoichiometric equivalence between the addition of nutrients to an \n\necosystem and the addition of carbon to the same. Nixon (1995) proposed a trophic \n\nscheme for estuarine and coastal ocean ecosystems, where the organic carbon may be \n\nautochthonous or allochthonous: \n\nTrophic Scheme Organic Carbon Supply \n\ng C m-2 y-1 \n\nOligotrophic &lt;100 \n\nMesotrophic 100 \u2013 300 \n\nEutrophic 301 \u2013 500 \n\nHypertrophic > 500 \n\n\n\n 9\n\n \n\nIn some cases, total system production might not increase with higher nutrient input, \n\nbut rooted macrophytes may be replaced by macroalgae or phytoplankton, thus \n\nchanging the types and relative abundance of the primary producers (Nixon 1995). \n\nDifferences in internal N processing can have an impact on the effects of N \n\nenrichment in estuaries. Biogenic silica (BSi) enrichment in lake sediments is a \n\nsensitive proxy for P enrichment because BSi production by diatoms integrates the \n\nuse of silica on an annual timescale, silica is recycled slowly relative to P, and \n\nsedimented BSi is focussed into depositional zones (Smith et al 2006). \n\n \n\nAccording to Howarth et al (2000), the fertilisation of lakes, rivers, or coastal waters \n\nwith previously scarce nutrients, such as N or P, results in an excessive increase in \n\nthe production of organic matter. It subsequently causes changes in nutrients, light, \n\nand oxygen, thereby favouring some species over others, and causing shifts in the \n\nstructure of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and benthic communities. \u00c6rtebjerg et al \n\n(2003) concur in their interpretation of eutrophication as intensified inputs of nutrients \n\nand organic matter leading to changes in primary production, biological structure and \n\nturnover and resulting in a higher trophic state. The causative factors are: elevated inputs \n\nof nutrients from land, atmosphere or adjacent seas, elevated winter DIN- and DIP \n\nconcentrations, and increased winter N/P-ratios compared to the Redfield Ratio. The \n\neffects directly attributed to eutrophication are increased primary production, elevated \n\nlevels of biomass and chlorophyll a concentrations, shift in species composition of \n\nphytoplankton, and shift from long lived macroalgae to short lived nuisance species. \n\nThe secondary or indirect effects include increased or lowered oxygen concentrations, \n\nand changes in species composition and biomass of zoobenthos. Low oxygen \n\n\n\n 10\n\nconcentrations in the bottom water (oxygen depletion, hypoxia) can further affect the \n\nfish, benthic invertebrates and plants. Total oxygen depletion (anoxia) can result in the \n\nrelease of hydrogen sulphide from the sediment, causing extensive death of organisms \n\nassociated with the sea floor. As only a few species can survive these extreme \n\nconditions, and as it takes time for plants and animals to recolonise damaged areas, \n\neutrophication can result in impoverished biological communities and impaired \n\nconditions.  \n\n \n\nAndersen et al (2006) have put forward the definition of eutrophication as \u2018the  \n\nenrichment of water by nutrients, especially nitrogen and/or phosphorus and  \n\norganic matter, causing an increased growth of algae and higher forms of  \n\nplant life to produce an unacceptable deviation in structure, function and stability of \n\norganisms present in the water and to the quality of water concerned, compared to \n\nreference conditions\u2019. And as highlighted by other workers, it is anthropogenic \n\neutrophication that is of interest. An indicator often used for assessment of \n\neutrophication and as a proxy for primary productivity, nutrient status or phytoplankton \n\nbiomass is chlorophyll a (Chl a). Andersen et al (2006) recommend some caution \n\nwhen using this indicator, and the information inherent in Chl a measurements should \n\nbe interpreted as what it is: a Chl a concentration and nothing more.  \n\n \n\nAs stated by Bricker et al (1999, 2007), eutrophication is the process in which the \n\naddition of nutrients, especially N and P, stimulates the growth of algae This otherwise \n\nnatural process has been greatly accelerated by human activities in recent decades. \n\nIncreased nutrient inputs foster a variety of symptoms, starting with intense algal \n\ngrowth, which may lead to more serious symptoms. The first stages of water quality \n\n\n\n 11\n\ndegradation due to eutrophication can be indicated by high abundance of algae, \n\nepiphytes, and/or macroalgae. In many estuaries, primary symptoms may lead to \n\nsecondary symptoms, such as the loss of submerged aquatic vegetation, nuisance and \n\ntoxic algal blooms, and low dissolved oxygen. The onset of secondary symptoms, even \n\nat moderate levels, indicates a more serious problem. \n\n \n\nFinnveden and Potting (1999) define eutrophication as increased production  \n\nbased on the Redfield ratio of nutrients, where greater production is achieved when the \n\nbalance of nutrients in the system approaches that of the Redfield ratio. According to \n\nRabalais (2002), it is the increased accumulation of organic matter usually as a result of \n\nincreased nitrogen and phosphorus inputs, but also states that the condition could also \n\nresult from the external supply of excessive decomposable organic carbon. Where \n\nexcess carbon is produced and accumulates, secondary effects of eutrophication often \n\noccur such as noxious algal blooms (which may be toxic), decreased water clarity, and \n\nlow dissolved oxygen. The ultimate symptom is the loss or degradation of habitat with \n\nrepercussions on marine biodiversity, and changes in ecosystem structure and function \n\nsuch as cycling of elements and processing of pollutants. Over the last two decades, \n\nit has become increasingly apparent that the effects of eutrophication are not minor \n\nand localised, but have large-scale implications and are spreading rapidly. \n\n \n\nThe US National Estuarine Eutrophication Assessment study (ASSETS \n\nhttp://www.eutro.org/) defined the term as a natural process whereby the productivity \n\nof an aquatic system increases, in terms of organic matter, as an outcome of high \n\nnutrient inputs. These inputs occur naturally, but have been enhanced by human-\n\nrelated activities. The resulting impacts are interrelated, and include nuisance and \n\n\n\n 12\n\ntoxic algal blooms, lowered dissolved oxygen, and loss of submerged aquatic \n\nvegetation and benthic fauna. They are seen as having negative consequences on water \n\nquality, ecosystem health, and human uses. \n\nAn alternate definition provided by ASSETS is that of a process that encourages algal \n\ngrowth. Human activities have hastened nutrient inputs, causing excessive growth of \n\nalgae and resulting in degraded water quality, and thereby hindering human use of \n\nestuarine resources.  \n\n \n\nFerreira et al (2009) have described eutrophication as a process hastened by the \n\nenrichment of water with nutrients, especially N and/or P. this leads to situations of \n\nincreased growth, primary production, and biomass of algae. Changes occur in the \n\nbalance of organisms and the water quality is degraded. The outcomes of \n\neutrophication are not desirable if they degrade ecosystem health to a considerable \n\nextent and/or the provision of goods and services in a sustainable manner. \n\n \n\nElliott and de Jonge (2002) point out that hypertrophication, distinct from \n\neutrophication, is of particular importance and is evident in estuaries that have high \n\nlevels of nutrients. In hypertrophic systems, excess algal growth is restricted due to \n\nlight limiting conditions such as high turbidity. In coastal systems that harbour \n\ndense populations of bivalves, the turbidity related to algal density may be \n\ncontrolled by the cropping of the phytoplankton, as grazing by the bivalves is a \n\nmajor factor in controlling their growth (Gerritsen et al 1994, Newell 2004). \n\n \n\nAt the opposite end of the trophic scale, an oligotrophic environment can be \n\ndefined by a low nutrient change of a fraction of C per litre per day (<100 g C m-2 y-1), \n\n\n\n 13\n\nand by low total concentration of nutrients (Nixon 1995, Cavicchioli et al 2003). Low \n\nprimary production (?5 \u00b5g l-1) as mentioned above can also occur due to other reasons \n\n(Bricker et al 1999, 2003). \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2. ?itrogen, phosphorus, and eutrophication of coastal systems \n\n \n\nN loads are crucial in influencing the extent to which a system becomes \n\neutrophied, as N is generally the limiting nutrient in coastal waters (Bricker et al \n\n2007). It is the most prevalent limiting nutrient in temperate marine systems \n\n(Finnveden and Potting 1999, Howarth et al 2000, Howarth 2008, Wolanski et al, \n\n2008, Nixon and Fulweiler, 2009). Unlike N, P that is deposited into marine systems \n\nand accumulated into marine sediments is often annually remineralised from the \n\nsediments and returned to the water column (Conley 2000). Estuarine systems also \n\nreceive oceanic waters, apart from that from terrestrial sources, and have a low \n\noverall N concentration because of the denitrification that occurs on the continental \n\nshelves and the low numbers of N fixers in estuarine waters. This situation is \n\ncompounded by their slow growth rates and grazing mortality by zooplankton and \n\nbenthic organisms (Correll 1998, Howarth and Marino 2006). \n\n \n\nOn the contrary, in some systems or seasons, P may be the limiting nutrient (Bricker \n\net al, 2007).  P limitation may be more common in freshwater systems (Finnveden \n\nand Potting 1999, Rabalais 2002, Wolanski et al, 2008); and in tropical coastal \n\nsystems that have carbonate sediments, that can strongly bind P through the \n\ninteraction with Fe, thereby leaving it largely unavailable to organisms (Conley 2000, \n\n\n\n 14\n\nHowarth et al 2000, Howarth and Marino 2006, Nixon and Fulweiler, 2009) and the \n\nhigh degree of N fixation in the benthos by cyanobacterial mats, epiphytes, and \n\nsymbionts (Howarth and Marino 2006). As anthropogenic nutrient enrichment of \n\ntropical waters increases, the rate at which sediments adsorb P decreases, making a \n\ngreater proportion of it biologically available and this may make the system N limited \n\n(Howarth et al 2000, Howarth and Marino 2006). The storage of P in estuarine \n\nsediments is generally lower than in freshwater sediments because of higher sulphate \n\nconcentrations that lead to higher rates of sulphate reduction, and consequently greater \n\nsequestration of iron by sulphides (Correll 1998, Howarth and Marino 2006). P is \n\nadsorbed to a smaller extent on iron sulphides than on other iron compounds, though the \n\nimportance of this process varies among estuaries. With increased eutrophication, there \n\nis usually more P released into the water column since more organic carbon leads to \n\nmore reducing sediments, thereby increasing the likelihood of N limitation of the \n\nsystem with increased nutrient loading (Howarth and Marino 2006). \n\n \n\nFor an aquatic system, three main factors establish whether N or P will be the limiting \n\nnutrient: \n\n(1) The N:P ratio in external nutrient inputs \n\n(2) The preferential of N or P from the photic zone as a outcome of biogeochemical \n\nprocesses such as denitrification, sedimentation of N in zooplankton faecal pellets, or \n\nadsorption of P into sediments \n\n(3) The degree to which any deficiency in N relative to P is made up through biological \n\nN fixation \n\nAs a result of all these factors, estuaries and coasts are more likely to be N limited than \n\nare freshwater systems (Howarth 1988). \n\n\n\n 15\n\n \n\nAs stated by Hecky and Kilham (1988), the concomitant limitation by multiple nutrients \n\nhas not been demonstrated for any unialgal culture in a chemostat. This phenomenon is \n\nnot one that is expected because one macronutrient cannot substitute another in its \n\nbiochemical functions. However, diverse algal species cultured in chemostats can be \n\nlimited by multiple nutrients due to differences among species for the optimum nutrient \n\nratios for growth. Nutrient levels below optimum lead to limitations, for which reason \n\nratios in nutrient loads can have a strong selective effect on the species in the \n\nphytoplankton communities and can affect the biomass yield. \n\n \n\nAlong the estuarine to marine continuum, multiple nutrient limitations can occur among \n\nN, P, and silicon (Si) along the salinity gradient as well as by season (Howarth et al \n\n2000, Rabalais 2002, Wolanski et al 2008). Increased N loads cannot be analysed \n\nwithout taking into consideration other nutrients that are essential for plant growth, \n\nnamely P and Si, and micronutrients such as iron (Fe). Elevated levels of nutrients \n\nalong with altered nutrient ratios cause several complex changes in aquatic ecosystems \n\n(Rabalais 2002). \n\n \n\nRelative to the greater flux of N and P to the coast, which are generally associated with \n\nhuman activity (urbanisation and agriculture), loads of dissolved silica (Si), primarily \n\nassociated with the weathering of silica-bearing minerals have remained the same or \n\nhave lessened, such that the proportions of Si:N or Si:P in river effluents have decreased \n\nover time while the N:P ratio increased. The dissolved Si:N ratio is inversely correlated \n\nto indices of landscape development such as population or agricultural intensity. When \n\nthe Si:N ratio approaches the Redfield ratio of 1:1, shifts in the dominant species of \n\n\n\n 16\n\nphytoplankton communities and harmful algal blooms may occur. A significant \n\ndeviation from the Redfield ratio of Si:N:P of 16:16:1 indicates a growth-limiting \n\ndeficiency of any one of these elements. It was proposed that for the same quantity of N, \n\nas the N:P, Si:P, and Si:N ratios simultaneously approach the Redfield ratio, \n\nphytoplankton production becomes less dependent on any single growth limiting \n\nnutrient and increases (Finnveden  and Potting  1999, Rabalais  2002). As diatom \n\nproduction increases upon nutrient enrichment, Si availability decreases. Si becomes \n\nfurther unavailable when it is trapped in bottom sediments as diatoms die and sink. A \n\ndecline in available Si can limit growth of diatoms or cause a shift from heavily silicified \n\nto less silicified types of diatoms. When waters are N limited, the algal community is \n\ndominated by diatoms, which tend to sink to the bottom, activating decomposition \n\nprocesses that consume dissolved oxygen creating hypoxia. In contrast, when P limits \n\nthe primary production, the phytoplankton community is dominated by smaller or \n\nlighter algal species and comparatively little sinks to the bottom (Howarth et al 2000). \n\nMacrophytes such as Ulva and its epiphytes have the capacity to take up and immobilise \n\navailable N and P, slowing their recycling. These conditions seem to enhance the \n\nrelease of soluble reactive P from the anoxic sediment leading to an imbalance in \n\nrecycling between N and P (Varioli et al 1996). Increased nutrient inputs may increase \n\nthe macroalgal biomass to the point where grazers cannot control them (Finnveden and \n\nPotting 1999, Bricker et al 2007, McQuatters-Gollop et al 2009, Nixon and Fulweiler, \n\n2009). These blooms are capable of lasting for months at a time and shade light \n\ndependent submerged aquatic vegetation, causing the deposition of organic matter in the \n\nbenthic zone. Upon the death of the organic matter, dissolved oxygen is consumed and \n\nN and P are also released which can then be reused to fix more organic matter. This \n\n\n\n 17\n\nrecycling may occur several times before being flushed out of the system (Nixon and \n\nFulweiler 2009). \n\n \n\nThreshold effects occur in marine systems when nutrient loads exceed their capacity for \n\nassimilation, and degradation of water quality occurs with adverse effects on the \n\ncomponents of the system and on ecosystem functioning. Nutrient inputs initially result \n\nin a series of fisheries yields that increases to a maximum as nutrient load increases, \n\nfollowing which a decline in fisheries occurs as seasonal hypoxia and permanent anoxia \n\nbecome established features of the system. Eutrophication of surface waters \n\naccompanied by oxygen deficiency in bottom waters can lead to change in the \n\ndominance of fish varieties from demersals to pelagics. The accumulated loads of \n\norganic matter and the internal loads of inorganic and organic nutrients in the sediments \n\nbelow eutrophic waters maintain the conditions of eutrophication since they continue to \n\nbe processed by normal geochemical processes in the sediment. A decrease in the \n\nnutrient loads to estuarine and coastal systems does not result in an immediate shift in \n\neutrophic conditions, partially because of the continued remineralisation of labile carbon \n\nand regeneration of nutrients (Rabalais 2002). \n\n \n\nFor many systems, while there is some nutrient input from natural sources, most input is \n\nnow human-related, from concentrated localised sources like wastewater treatment \n\nplants, or diffuse sources such as urban runoff, agriculture and atmospheric deposition. \n\nAn understanding of the volumes of present loads and that expected in the future would \n\nprovide greater insight into the application of management measures and their being \n\nsuccessful (Bricker et al 2007). \n\n \n\n\n\n 18\n\nThe occurrence of hypoxia and/or anoxia is the best understood and most severe \n\nimpact of eutrophication, and is the link between N, or sometimes P, inputs and the \n\nincreased production of organic matter that results in low dissolved oxygen them \n\n(Nixon and Fulweiler, 2009). \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3 Hypoxia and anoxia \n\n \n\nA common indication of eutrophication is hypoxia (typically defined as dissolved \n\noxygen concentration DO &lt;2 mg l-1, Wolanski et al 2008) and anoxia (DO = 0). \n\nWhen the DO is less than a critical value (typically 2mg l-1), mobile animals such as \n\ndemersal fish, crabs and shrimp migrate away from the area. Resident animals die when \n\nthe DO &lt;1 mg l-1 (Wolanski et al, 2008). \n\n \n\nThe displacement of pelagic organisms and the loss of particular demersal and benthic \n\norganisms are some evident effects of hypoxia/anoxia. Hypoxia also affects optimal \n\ngrowth rates and reproductive capacity (Wolanski et al 2008). As oxygen levels fall from \n\nsaturation through optimal levels, towards exhaustion, behavioural and physiological \n\ndamage is caused in the animals residing in the water column, in the sediments or attached \n\nto hard substrates. With the drop of oxygen levels from 0.5 mg L-1 towards 0 mg L-1, the \n\ndecrease in benthic diversity, abundance and biomass becomes reasonably linear \n\n(Rabalais 2002, Wolanski et al 2008). \n\n \n\nAerobic bacteria utilise oxygen when decomposing the excess organic matter that sinks to \n\nthe seabed from the upper water column. An overall loss of oxygen will occur in the lower \n\n\n\n 19\n\nwater column if the rate of oxygen consumption is greater than that of its diffusion to the \n\nbottom waters from the surface (Rabalais 2002, Wolanski et al 2008). With increasing \n\neutrophication, there is a corresponding increase in the concentrations of organic carbon \n\nand nitrogen, microbial biomass, microbial decomposition potential of substrates, and \n\ncommunity oxygen consumption, but this does not occur linearly. A redox potential \n\ndiscontinuity layer shifts upward towards the sediment-water interface, sulphate \n\nrespiration takes over oxygen respiration, H2S is generated from the sediments, and \n\noxygen does not penetrate as deeply into the sediments from the bioturbation potential \n\nof the macrofauna as their numbers are lowered from sulphide toxicity or a lack of \n\nsufficient oxygen. The sediment becomes more susceptible to resuspension and adds to \n\nthe turbidity of the overlying waters, and this in turn reduces the potential for the \n\ngrowth of the photosynthetic microphytobenthos and generation of oxygen into the \n\nlower water column (Rabalais 2002). \n\n \n\nAs overlying waters become anoxic, many of the microbially mediated processes in the \n\nsurface sediments get altered, often with negative feedback that leads to continued \n\ndeterioration of water quality. The nitrification/denitrification cycle of estuarine and \n\ncontinental shelf sediments, which returns N2 to the atmosphere is a mitigating \n\nmechanism to excess reactive N, but the nitrification portion of this cycle is disrupted by \n\nthe lowered availability of oxygen in overlying waters (Rabalais 2002). With the shift \n\nin redox potential in the sediments with decreasing oxygen concentration, high  \n\nNH4\n+ concentrations usually arise. The anoxic conditions inhibit nitrification  \n\nand the NH4\n+ released from the sediments cannot be nitrified to NO3\n\n-. Release of PO4\n-3 \n\nfrom the benthos into the overlying water is also magnified under low dissolved \n\noxygen concentrations (Correll 1998, Heijs et al 2000, Pinckney et al 2001, Rabalais \n\n\n\n 20\n\n2002). These inorganic nutrients become available to encourage further \n\nphytoplankton production in the overlying water. The degree to which these nutrients \n\nare circulated upward through the water column and across strong pycnoclines is not \n\nknown (Rabalais 2002). \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4. Impacts of climate on coastal eutrophication \n\n \n\nCertain factors associated with climate change are expected to have the greatest impacts \n\non coastal eutrophication (Bricker et al 1999, 2007): \n\n \n\nElevated temperatures may lead to an increase in the range of species that occupy \n\ncoastal waters, as well as an increase in the number of macrophytes and their \n\nassociated growth period. Hypoxia in coastal waters would be aggravated due to the \n\nlower capacity of warmer waters to hold dissolved oxygen. \n\n \n\nSea-level rise due to climate change may cause changes in water balance and \n\ncirculation patterns in coastal systems. Sea level rise will gradually submerge coastal \n\nlands, causing greater erosion and sediment delivery to water bodies, and potentially \n\nflooding wetlands that act as sinks for nutrients. \n\n \n\nChanges in precipitation may affect land runoff, stratification of and oxygen \n\nconcentration in bottom waters, and water circulation patterns. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 21\n\n2.5. Assessment of eutrophication \n\n \n\nBricker et al (1999, 2007) used three primary symptoms to define the first stages of \n\nwater quality degradation in estuaries \u2013 algal abundance (Chl a as the indicator), \n\nepiphyte abundance, and macroalgae. In many cases, the primary symptoms lead to \n\nsecondary symptoms, such as the loss of submerged aquatic vegetation, nuisance and \n\ntoxic algal blooms, and low dissolved oxygen. The classification of coastal systems \n\nbased on these primary and/or secondary eutrophication symptoms has been carried out \n\nin the USA: \n\n \n\nAn increase in two of the primary symptoms \u2013 chlorophyll a  (phytoplankton  \n\nbiomass) and macroalgal abundance \u2013 denotes the first possible stage of  \n\nwater quality deterioration associated with eutrophication. Because of the high variability \n\nof short-term measurements, N and P concentrations cannot be used as a measure of \n\neutrophication (Bricker et al 1999, 2007). \n\n \n\nThree secondary symptoms portray more serious consequences: low DO levels, loss of \n\nsubmerged aquatic vegetation, and the occurrence of nuisance/toxic algal blooms. \n\nSecondary symptoms can sometimes exist without having been the outcome of primary \n\nsymptoms. This may occur when toxic algal blooms are transported into the system from \n\nan external source like the ocean (Bricker et al 1999, 2007). \n\n \n\nThe overall eutrophic conditions for the estuaries studied by Bricker et al (2007) use the \n\ncategories of \u201clow\u201d, \u201cmoderate\u201d, and \u201chigh\u201d, based on scores assigned to the primary \n\nand secondary symptoms described earlier. Through this method, systems with \n\n\n\n 22\n\nmoderate to high primary symptoms and low secondary symptoms have well - \n\ndeveloped problems associated with elevated chlorophyll a and/or macroalgal \n\nblooms are in the early stages of eutrophication and may be on the verge of \n\ndeveloping more serious conditions. \n\n \n\nThere are many reasons for systems with low primary symptoms and moderate to high \n\nsecondary symptoms: blooms may be produced offshore and then be transported into \n\nthe coastal system. Additionally some blooms have no direct relation to the nutrient \n\nconditions (Bricker et al 2007). \n\nAlternatively, water quality in relations may have improved recently, but the response \n\ntime for the reduction of secondary symptoms is longer than that for primary symptoms. \n\nThe secondary symptoms still evident could be lingering conditions that might improve \n\nas nutrient concentrations continue to decrease. Secondary conditions also occur \n\nwithout necessarily being related to nutrient enrichment. For example, local dredging \n\noperations can cause the loss of submerged aquatic vegetation due to physical removal \n\nor disruption of habitat. In warmer climates, DO concentrations may be lower than \n\ncooler climates due to the lowered oxygen solubility at higher water temperatures \n\n(Bricker et al 2007). \n\n Rabalais (2002) has described in marine ecosystems dominated by macroalgae (as \n\nopposed to the earlier description of the process in estuaries), a series of shifts in species \n\noccur as eutrophication increases: \n\nIn uneutrophied marine or brackishsh allow coastal waters, the dominant producers \n\nare usually perennial benthic macrophytes, such as seagrasses and other phanerogams \n\non soft bottoms, or long-lived seaweeds on hard substrates. \n\n\n\n 23\n\nIn the stages of slight to medium eutrophication, increased nutrient loading favours \n\nthe growth of bloom-forming phytoplankton and fast- growing, short-lived epiphytic \n\nmacroalgae over slow-growing, long-lived macrophytes. Phanerogams and perennial \n\nmacroalgal communities gradually decrease along with changes in the structure (species \n\ncomposition, coverage, or depth distribution limits) and their function (production \n\nand reproduction). \n\nWith increased nutrient loads towards hypereutrophic conditions,free-floating \n\nmacroalgae, in particular \u2018green tide\u2019 forming taxa such as Ulva and Enteromorpha \n\nalternate with dense phytoplankton blooms in dominance and replace the perennial and \n\nslow-growing benthic macrophytes until they become extinct. \n\nUnder hypereutrophic conditions, phytoplankton constitute the dominant primary \n\nproducers and benthic macrophytes disappear completely. This sequence of events does \n\nnot occur by degrees, but is stepwise with sudden shifts (Rabalais 2002). \n\n \n\nInformation pertaining to the levels and trends of eutrophic symptoms and of nutrient \n\ninput is necessary for the assessment of overall eutrophic conditions, establishment of \n\nbaseline conditions, and tracking of the conditions of an estuary. This would be highly \n\nuseful in gauging the success of management actions. The information would also be \n\nrequired to determine the influencing factors so that appropriate managements plans can \n\nbe implemented (Bricker et al 1999). \n\n\n\n 24\n\nCHAPTER 3: DRIVERS OF ?UTRIE?T LOADI?G, A?D REGIME SHIFTS I? \n\nCOASTAL ECOSYSTEMS \n\n \n\n \n\n3.1. Drivers of nutrient loading \n\n \n\nIn the past few decades there has been an enormous increase in coastal eutrophication \n\non a global scale, resulting in widespread hypoxia and anoxia, habitat degradation, \n\nalteration of food web structure, loss of biodiversity, and increased frequency, \n\ndistribution, and duration of harmful algal blooms. N loading drives a substantial level \n\nof eutrophication, although pollution from P can also contribute to coastal \n\neutrophication (Howarth 2008). \n\n \n\nAquaculture development has been encouraged on the basis that it can compensate for \n\nthe insufficiency in food production due to decreasing wild fisheries (Primavera 2006). \n\nNear-shore aquaculture, which has been actively developed over the past few decades, \n\nintroduces organic and inorganic wastes into the environment increasing the risk of \n\neutrophication (by modifying N:P ratios) and pollution, where organic enrichment of \n\nthe sediments would hasten benthic oxygen consumption. Apart from this is the \n\npossibility of introducing disease, altering the endemic biodiversity, and altering system \n\nresilience and carrying capacity (Buschmann et al 2008). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 25\n\n3.1.1 Drivers of 0 loading \n\n \n\nN is fundamental for life and yet biologically available forms are a small percentage of \n\nthe Earth\u2019s nitrogen, and for this reason primary production is limited by N in many \n\necosystems around the world. Before the industrial revolution, N was biologically \n\navailable only through bacterial fixation and chemical reaction with oxygen during \n\ninfrequent reactions associated with energy sources such as lightning and volcanic \n\neruptions. Over the past few decades, human activities have generated reactive N at a \n\npace that rivals the natural rate of production globally, and is identified with an \n\n\u201cexplosive increase\u201d in the incidence of coastal marine eutrophication worldwide. \n\nTherefore, taking into account natural fixation on land and in the oceans, human activity \n\nhas raised the total rate of production of reactive N on a global scale by 35 \u2013 55% \n\n(Howarth 2008). \n\n \n\nHuman activity produces reactive N by three means: \n\nAssistance of biological fixation associated with agriculture \n\nProduction of synthetic N fertiliser \n\nUnintended creation of reactive N by oxidation of atmospheric N when fossil fuels are \n\nburned \n\n(Rabalais 2002, Howarth 2008) \n\nAmong these, the greatest change during the 20th century was in the rate of production \n\nof synthetic N fertiliser. It allowed for considerable expansion of agriculture with \n\nassociated decreases in hunger and malnutrition (Howarth 2008). \n\n \n\n\n\n 26\n\nReactive N compounds such as ammonium ions and ammonia have residence times of \n\napproximately a day due to quick assimilation into living organisms. The consequences \n\nof the acceleration of the nitrogen cycles by humans varies on the regional scale \n\nbecause most reactive N moves only over short distances and due to the variation in the \n\nquantity of reactive N produced from region to region around the world. Temperate \n\nregions, the major sites of industry and agriculture, are where most of the human \n\nproduction and use of reactive N occurred during the 20th century, though most of the \n\nbiological N fixation occurs in the tropics (Howarth 2008). \n\n \n\nA measure of how humans have altered the N cycle is the increase in the rate of N \n\ndeposition from the atmosphere since the industrial revolution. Another measure of the \n\nmagnitude of change in the cycle is the increase in the flux of N in rivers to coastal \n\nareas and oceans. Climate can also have an effect on riverine N fluxes, which are higher \n\nin regions having more precipitation and freshwater discharge (Howarth 2008). \n\n \n\nHuman inputs of N have several sources that vary among the different regions of the \n\nworld. On a worldwide scale, synthetic N fertiliser production is the single biggest \n\nalteration of the N cycle by humans, and in many regions and watersheds, agriculture \n\ndominates the N flux. The extent to which fertiliser is used differs by about 1000-fold \n\nbetween countries tend to apply fertiliser more intensively, and increasing per capita \n\nincome in developing countries along with agricultural training programmes is likely to \n\nincrease the use of fertiliser in these regions (Nixon 1995, Howarth 2008). \n\n \n\nIn those areas where agriculture does not predominate, the single largest input of N is \n\natmosphere deposition of oxidised N compounds, with the N originating from the \n\n\n\n 27\n\ncombustion of fossil fuels. The amount of N inadvertently fixed during the \n\ncombustion of fossil fuels is small when compared to the rate at which synthetic \n\nfertiliser is produced globally. However this can be a significant source of N \n\npollution in some regions. Greater urbanisation and use of motor vehicles increases the \n\nemission of N oxides to the atmosphere in large cities, most of which are located in the \n\ncoastal zone. Atmospheric nutrient inputs to the coastal ocean may also arise from \n\nnatural sources like deserts. This input may be episodic but periodic occurrences of high \n\ndeposition may have significant effects on the phytoplankton communities. Direct \n\ndeposition is most significant in large systems, or in those coastal systems with a small \n\nratio of watershed to surface water area (Nixon 1995, Jickells 1998, Pinckney et al \n\n2001, Bricker et al 2007, Howarth 2008). The importation of food and feeds to the \n\nregion is the second largest input (Howarth 2008). \n\n \n\nOver these large extents, the flux of riverine N to the coast is dependent on net \n\nanthropogenic N inputs. Agriculture plays a role in N pollution of surface waters from \n\nboth, the direct runoff from agricultural lands and from the N in animal wastes. In the \n\nUnited States, most of the crop that is not exported is used as animal feed, and this is a \n\nmajor driver in using synthetic N fertiliser in agriculture (Howarth 2008). Increased \n\nconsumption of animal protein also contributes to N pollution, and being related to per \n\ncapita income, is rising in developing countries (Nixon 1995). N in animal feed is not \n\neffectively converted to N in animal protein; so much of the N is excreted in the animal \n\nwaste and into the environment (Nixon 1995, Howarth 2008). Of the N contained in the \n\nanimal wastes, an estimated 30% is volatilised to the atmosphere as ammonia, most of \n\nwhich gets deposited at the site of emission. The fate of most of the N in animal wastes \n\nis not well known, but it contributes via direct or indirect means towards water \n\n\n\n 28\n\npollution. With the availability of synthetic N fertiliser, the utilisation of animal waste \n\nto fertilise soil has now been made no longer necessary (Howarth 2008). Pfiesteria \n\npiscicida, a dinoflagellate responsible for massive fish kills in Pamlico-Albemarle \n\nSound (North Carolina, USA), and one that poses serious neurological human health \n\nrisks, is associated with high organic loading from sewage or hog/chicken wastes. \n\nThus there is evidence for the linkage of nutrient over-enrichment to some toxic \n\nspecies that kill or disable higher organisms and the formation of non-toxic but \n\nnoxious blooms that can lead to other habitat impairments (Rabalais 2002). \n\n \n\n \n\n3.1.2. Drivers of P loading \n\n \n\nAnthropogenic sources of P may be delivered to coastal systems through highly \n\nconcentrated point sources where the P is in soluble form, and diffuse sources where a \n\ngreater proportion is particulate (Withers and Jarvie 2008). \n\n \n\nAccording to Withers and Jarvie (2008), wastewaters from sewage treatment plants and \n\nindustrial sites contribute towards the load of P in rivers. In rural catchments, septic \n\ntanks may contribute significantly to riverine P as a concentrated source if they \n\ndischarge directly into streams or do not have adequate soakaway facilities (a hole dug \n\ninto permeable ground that is filled with granular material and usually covered with \n\nsoil, which allows collected water to soak into the ground). \n\n \n\nRunoff from urban areas, including atmospheric deposition, urban and industrial debris, \n\ndetergents, and lubricants, are other sources of riverine P. Though the concentration of \n\n\n\n 29\n\nP in runoff may vary greatly, it increases with population level. Farmyard runoff is high \n\nin soluble P, especially from livestock manure (with higher concentration from animals \n\nsupplemented with P-enriched feed), sheds, and paths. Drainage from agricultural lands \n\nincludes soil and fertiliser manufactured from mined P. Storm events would cause soil \n\nerosion that would increase the quantity of such materials carried to rivers. Since P \n\ninputs to soils (especially as fertiliser) exceed its outputs in farm products, and unlike N, \n\nwill not be lost to the atmosphere (denitrification), it can accumulate in the soil with the \n\npotential for increased runoff from the land to surface waters (Rabalais 2002, Carpenter \n\n2005, Withers and Jarvie 2008). \n\n \n\nMuch P is adsorbed to soil particles, and so riverine sediment transport of eroded soils \n\nalso represents a flux of P. the greater flux of P eroded from land or carried through \n\nwastewaters to rivers have increased the global flux of P to the oceans almost 3-fold \n\nabove historic levels of ~8 million Tg P yr-1 to the present load of ~22 Tg yr-1. The \n\naccumulation of P in the landscapes of developed countries has started to decline, but \n\nthat of developing countries is increasing (Rabalais 2002). \n\n  \n\nWhile direct P loading to estuarine and coastal systems may not be as significant as N \n\nloading, when conditions of eutrophication are enhanced, oxygen in coastal waters can \n\ndecline, and the bottom sediments become more reducing in nature. This can result in \n\nan increase in the quantity of P released to the water column than would usually occur \n\n(Howarth and Marino 2006) as has been described earlier in chapter 2, section 2.2. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 30\n\n3.2 Regime shifts \n\n \n\nThe increase in nutrient inputs is not the only driver of changes in algal biomass in \n\ncoastal waters, and reduction in nutrient inputs does not always result in the expected \n\noutcomes. Along with the time that has elapsed between the pressure and restoration, \n\nthe response of coastal systems to minimisation of anthropogenic nutrient inputs might \n\nbe more complex than expected as changes in other control factors may occur at the \n\nsimultaneously. The ongoing change in these baselines (reference status) that indicates \n\nthat a coastal system faced with having to return to oligotrophy from eutrophy may \n\ndeviate from simply reverting from the changes encountered during the earlier phase of \n\neutrophication (Duarte et al 2009). These are very significant changes, and involve \n\nseveral basic factors involved in the functioning of coastal ecosystems, that, according \n\nto Andersen et al (2008) and Duarte et al (2009), they would have forced, separately and \n\ncollectively, the coastal systems to move away from the reference status even in the \n\nabsence of direct anthropogenic inputs, and would result in abrupt changes on several \n\ntrophic levels. This is a \u2018regime shift\u2019 involving the resistance of the ecosystem to return \n\nto its original status with the imposed oligotrophication, due to hysteresis resulting from \n\nnonlinearities in the ecosystem. This scenario considers coastal ecosystems to flip \n\nbetween alternative stable states; while during the development of shifting baselines no \n\nstate is necessarily stable (Duarte et al 2009). \n\n \n\nThe degradation of coastal systems around the world has promoted efforts to determine \n\nthe pressures that are responsible and the identification of a reference status to which \n\nthe system is supposed to return on reduction of these pressures. Progress has been \n\nachieved scientifically with the growing understanding of anthropogenic impacts on \n\n\n\n 31\n\ncoastal systems; however, the definition of the reference status that is to be attained \n\nupon the minimisation of the direct anthropogenic pressures is still to be elucidated \n\n(Duarte et al 2009). Duarte et al (2009) suggests taking into account the possibility of \n\nshifting baselines and regime shifts in the ecosystems to evaluate attainable outcomes of \n\nrestoration efforts. With increasing human pressures on coastal ecosystem, the need for \n\nanalytical methods for identifying ecological thresholds and regime shifts becomes \n\nmore urgent (Andersen et al 2008) and the means of identifying them without having to \n\ncross them are required (Duarte et al 2009). \n\n\n\n 32\n\nChapter 4: MA?AGEME?T RESPO?SES \n\n \n\n \n\nAs reviewed in the previous section, the return of an ecosystem to a past state may not \n\nbe the expected outcome because of the occurrence of shifting baselines in various \n\nfactors involved in the functioning of the system, and the presumption that management \n\ncan restore ecosystems to \u201cpristine\u201d states should be replaced by targets that securely \n\nperpetuate key ecosystem functions, and hence the steady supply of beneficial services \n\nto society (Duarte et al 2009). Management responses that take the above considerations \n\ninto account can be evaluated by budgeting exercises, a useful framework in this regard. \n\n \n\nIn the subsequent sections, the utility of budgets in nutrient management is addressed, \n\nas are some general approaches, involving monitoring, and technological and policy \n\nresponses, for the management of nutrient loading to coastal system. This is followed by \n\nmeans for improving the efficiency of nutrient use in agroecosystems, an important \n\ndiffuse source of nutrients to coastal systems. Technical concepts for reducing the \n\nrunoff and leaching of N to coastal areas from watersheds and concepts for the removal \n\nof P from wastewaters are discussed as the removal of N or P or both along the \n\nfreshwater-marine gradients is required. Management approaches follow in the last \n\nsection for waste generated from mariculture, an important means of supplementing \n\nwild fish catches. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 33\n\n4.1 Budgets as a tool in nutrient management \n\n \n\nWhole system nutrient budgets have been used as quantitative schemes to analyse \n\nestuarine N and P inputs, transformations, and fate. The results from budgeting \n\nexercises encourage the users to think about the fluxes and drivers of the state of a \n\nsystem in a quantitative manner, and not only about the apparent symptoms. They \n\nprovide a quantitative comparison of the nutrient fluxes in the system and stimulate \n\nthought about the relative importance of various sources and sinks of nutrients in their \n\nbiogeochemical cycling, which provide support in settling management priorities (Le \n\nTissier et al 2006, Boynton et al 2008). By applying budgeting methods before and after \n\nthe implementation of management plans, they can be used to determine whether the \n\nplans have proven effective in reducing nutrient loads. They find use as environmental \n\nindicators of nutrient use efficiency and are therefore useful in policy and regulation \n\n(Oenema et al 2003). Budgeting can also demonstrate whether interactions occur \n\nbetween the system being monitored and adjacent marine waters. An input of nutrients \n\nfrom adjoining water bodies into the system under consideration may nullify the effect \n\nof the management responses. Conversely, the N and P that might be exported from the \n\nsystem to the adjoining water bodies may also be determined (Boynton et al 2008). \n\n \n\nThe value of budgets as a performance indicator also depends on reference or baseline \n\nlevels against which the nutrient balances can be evaluated. As has been done by \n\nBricker et al (1999), such levels can be set by reviewing data on a national scale and by \n\nconsulting local and regional experts. \n\n \n\n\n\n 34\n\nSuitable management plans, after an overall assessment of the system, must take into \n\naccount its eutrophic condition (low through moderate to high), the sources of nutrients \n\nto it, and the expected reductions in the loads should be guided by and also reflected in \n\nthe validity of the assessment results (ASSETS http://www.eutro.org/). These plans \n\nshould include measures to prevent/mitigate the effects of anthropogenic nutrient \n\nloading to coastal systems and the use of nutrient budgets to assess their effectiveness. \n\nThe following sections outline the possible measures that can be utilised towards this \n\nend. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2 General approaches to system management \n\n \n\nCoastal systems show great variations in their sensitivity to nutrient pollution because \n\nof differences in the size of the watersheds (reflected in the differing nutrient loads), \n\ndifferent physical mixing regimes, and differences in ecological structure (Howarth \n\n2000). Nutrient management efforts have halved riverine P loads to the northern \n\nAdriatic and coastal North Sea, from 14 t km-3 y-1 total P (Northern Adriatic Sea) and \n\n32.3 t km-3 y-1 total P (coastal North Sea) to 8 t km-3 y-1 and 12.9 t km-3 y-1 respectively. \n\nThis has come about mainly from the intervention on point sources, especially the ban \n\non P in detergents and the treatment of urban wastewater. A similar trend in riverine P \n\nloads has not been observed for the Baltic Sea, despite policy initiatives and severe \n\ndisruption of agriculture. This may be because of \u2018memory effects\u2019 due to nutrient \n\nsaturation with release of dissolved inorganic nutrients from sediments. Such cases may \n\nrequire some time before reduced loads are observed (Artioli et al 2008). \n\n \n\n\n\n 35\n\nBricker et al (1999) recommend the management of a system from a watershed \n\nperspective, and that it be focussed on nutrient sources that can be controlled. They also \n\nsuggest that strategies be adapted to individual watershed characteristics so that the \n\npotential for improvement is the greatest possible. These strategies should also consider \n\noverall eutrophic conditions and the human and natural factors influencing the level of \n\nexpression in each estuary, such that efforts can be focussed on those estuaries with the \n\nhighest susceptibility that will most profit from the control of nutrients. The natural \n\nfactors to be considered include nutrient sources and watershed alterations affecting \n\nnutrient delivery such as loss of wetlands. Estuaries with low eutrophic conditions but \n\nhigh susceptibility should have precedence for preventive managements \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2.1 Monitoring methods \n\n \n\nThe first step in a management plan should be an assessment of the given system, the \n\nbasis for which is a monitoring plan. Another important step is the setting of a reference \n\nstatus against which ecological quality can be assessed. Andersen et al (2006) define a \n\nreference condition as a description of the biological elements that exist, or would exist, \n\nat very low or no disturbance from human activity. This has to be derived from \n\nscientific knowledge (Bricker et al 1999). \n\n \n\nWith the development in the definitions of eutrophication, monitoring methods should \n\ninclude the measurement of primary production. In shallow waters, data on area \n\ncoverage by macroalgae and/or seagrasses can be used as a proxy for production (Nixon \n\n2009). Other methods that can be used to measure increased growth include the \n\n\n\n 36\n\nmonitoring of Chl a (McQuatters-Gollop et al 2009, Nixon 2009), Secchi depth, \n\nphytoplankton community composition, N:P ratios to assess the possible effects of \n\nimbalanced nutrient enrichment on the phytoplankton (McQuatters-Gollop et al 2009). \n\nAndersen et al (2006) suggest the use of 14C to precisely determine the uptake of C into \n\nphytoplankton or that incorporated into organic matter. As this would greatly increase \n\nthe expense of regular monitoring programmes, it would find use in providing \n\ninformation about a system when utilised after the initial symptoms of eutrophication \n\nhave been observed \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2.2 Technological responses \n\n \n\nTechnologies for treating animal wastes for the removal of nutrients and to prevent the \n\nvolatile losses of ammonia from these wastes to the atmosphere are necessary on a large \n\nscale, as are control strategies to reduce fertiliser runoff from agriculture and emission \n\nof N compounds from fossil fuel combustion. Stronger regulation and incentives for \n\ncompliance will all be required if these control strategies are to be better directed \n\ntowards solving pollution problems of coastal systems (Howarth et al 2000). Some \n\nsymptoms of eutrophication in estuaries may be partially mitigated by ecological \n\nengineering measures for nutrient reduction such as the building of treatment ponds, \n\ndredging, creating man-made channels for improved circulation by increased \n\ncommunication with the sea, and wetland restoration and creation (Wolanski et al \n\n2008). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 37\n\n4.2.3 Policy responses \n\n \n\nN reduction policies have had varying degrees of success. Reduction in riverine N loads \n\nis more difficult to achieve than P because N loads have relatively diffuse sources, \n\nparticularly farming. N emission is more closely related to human lifestyles, especially \n\ndiet and the associated significance for agriculture and livestock activities. Atmospheric \n\ntransport can also deposit N originating from distant powerplant and automobile \n\nemissions directly on coastal waters. A significant proportion of N discharged by rivers \n\nflows into groundwater, and due to its long retention time, efforts in reducing N \n\nemissions may not produce an immediate reduction in loads and the system may take \n\nseveral years to respond to such remedial action (Artioli et al 2008). \n\n \n\nIt is important to focus on those sources of nutrients that can be controlled in the system \n\nunder consideration. Also important is that the level of susceptibility, eutrophic \n\ncondition, and future outlook be used to set management priorities (Bricker et al 2007). \n\nConsiderable reductions in N and P may be achieved through a decrease in point source \n\nloading, especially through wastewater treatment (Carstensen et al 2006). For example, \n\nin order to combat an event of widespread anoxia in the Danish straits, an agenda was \n\nadopted recommending that the government act to reduce discharges and losses of N \n\n(by 50%) and P (by 80%) from agriculture, municipal wastewater treatment plants, and \n\nindividual industrial discharges. This plan was formulated with sector-specific reduction \n\nobjectives and targets. The specific objectives and targets were difficult to achieve \n\nduring the original time frame and another plan for sustainable agriculture was put into \n\naction. Considerable time lags occurred between changes in agriculture practice and \n\nwater quality responses, but these reductions would not have been achieved if periodic \n\n\n\n 38\n\nassessment for reduction assent had not been carried out and if the national monitoring \n\nprogramme had not remained focussed on eutrophication. Reduction in nutrient over-\n\nenrichment of coastal ecosystems will rely on the implementation of an adaptive \n\nmanagement framework (Carstensen et al 2006). \n\n \n\nLong-term (i.e., decadal) nutrient management strategies will also have to take into \n\nconsideration climatic and hence hydrologic fluctuations and the resultant shifts in in-\n\nstream N and P processing. Thus nutrient management should be highly adaptive, \n\ntaking into account short and longer-term patterns and trends, as well as keeping in \n\nmind relevant scales (Howarth et al 2000). A \u201cone shoe fits all\u201d appears inappropriate \n\nfor eutrophication, and different targets need to be met for systems of different scales \n\n(Artioli et al 2008). It is also worth considering that while management practices for \n\nreducing N pollution can be effective for P control, the converse does not hold true. \n\nThis is because N moves with surface and groundwater far more readily in dissolved \n\nforms than does P and is more subject to atmospheric transport (Howarth 2005). \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3 Improvement of nutrient use efficiency in agroecosystems \n\n \n\nAgroecosystems should be managed at several temporal and spatial scales to reduce the \n\nneed for chronic addition of excess nutrients. Landscape-level strategies that integrate \n\nwetlands and other types of riparian buffers into agricultural landscapes are very \n\neffective in protecting sensitive natural ecosystems and are essential for ecosystem-\n\nscale nutrient management. The incorporation of strategically located plant \n\ncommunities that can act as nutrient sinks in managed landscapes can effectively \n\n\n\n 39\n\ncapture particulate and soluble nutrients before they reach adjacent waterways or \n\naquatic systems. Including cover plants in rotation with the food/cash/biofuel crop \n\nincorporates more fertiliser into the microbial biomass than is leached from the soil as \n\ncompared to the continuous crop. This is due to the effect of the cover crop in \n\nincreasing the soil C content in proportion to other nutrients, which has a positive effect \n\non microbial uptake (Drinkwater and Snapp 2007). \n\n \n\n \n\n4.4 Technical approaches for the control of nitrogen loads from watersheds \n\n \n\nIn some estuarine systems, P may be the limiting nutrient in the spring (Cowan and \n\nBoynton 1996, Correll 1998, Conley 2000), and so the greatest effects of P reduction \n\nwould be observed during this season. This is also an important time of the year for the \n\nseasonal deposition of organic matter to the sediments. The reduction of P during this \n\ntime would make it more limiting, resulting in decreased accumulation of organic \n\nmatter. For deep estuaries that are P limited, the conditions of anoxia observed during \n\nthe summer that is spurred by spring production can be alleviated by reductions in P \n\nloads (Conley 2000). \n\n \n\nN limitations occur in some estuaries in the summer and fall (Cowan and Boynton 1996, \n\nCorrell 1998, Conley 2000), and N reduction strategies would serve to lower summer \n\nChl a concentrations and also reduce the growth of epiphytes that would shade the \n\nsubmerged aquatic vegetation (Conley 2000). If only P reductions were attempted such \n\nthat it becomes the limiting nutrient throughout the year, the retention of excess N in \n\nestuarine systems would be lowered and N would be delivered to the adjoining N-\n\n\n\n 40\n\nlimited coastal systems, thus only transferring the problem (Conley 2000, Rabalais \n\n2002). Therefore a coordinated effort for managing both N and P is required as P can \n\ninfluence the delivery of N to the coast.  \n\n \n\nThe biogeochemical cycle of Si is also altered upon excessive inputs of N and P, and \n\ndissolved silicate limitation may occur more frequently. Increases in the N and P \n\nconcentrations in the water column lowers the ratio of dissolved silica, and increased \n\ndiatom production leads to increased accumulation of biogenic silica in the sediments, \n\nthus lowering its content in the water column. The change in Si availability causes \n\ndiatoms to be replaced by phytoplankton that do not require it for growth, which may \n\nhave negative impacts on the food web (Conley et al 1993, Conley 2000).  \n\n \n\nMany technical solutions are available for the management of N to coastal systems. The \n\nfollowing list of N sources and solutions is summarised from Howarth (2005): \n\n \n\n1. Leaching and runoff from agricultural lands: in the United States, about 20% on \n\naverage of the new N input to agricultural fields leach to surface or ground \n\nwaters. Climate is important, and N losses are greater in wet years and in areas \n\nwith higher rainfall. Approaches with good potential for reducing the leaching of \n\nN from agricultural fields include  \n\n\u2022 Growing perennial crops rather than annuals, as perennials conserve N in the \n\nrooting zone and greatly reduce its loss to ground water. \n\n\u2022 Planting winter cover crops that would reduce the leaching of nitrate to \n\ngroundwater in the spring, which is when most leaching occurs \n\n\n\n 41\n\n\u2022 Applying N fertiliser as close as possible to the time of crop requirement, which \n\nis also an opportunity to reduce the quantity of fertiliser used. Increasing the \n\napplication of fertiliser increases crop yield up to a point, but once the crop \n\nrequirements are saturated, further fertilisation has no effect on production. The \n\nN that is not taken up by the crop is then available for leaching to surface and \n\nground water. \n\n\u2022 Artificial wetlands that intercept drainage from agricultural fields can provide a \n\nsink for N, if the landscape is such that it does not cause the fields to become \n\nflooded. Such wetlands can substantially reduce the flow of N to surface water. \n\nBuffer strips, which effective at capturing P (which is largely particle-bound), \n\nare not effective at trapping N from drainage systems unless the drain water is \n\nfully intercepted by the buffer. \n\n \n\n2. Animal production and concentrated animal feeding operations: this is a \n\nsignificant sector as the consumption of animal protein is increasing in countries \n\nwith high or improving economies \n\n\u2022 Composting is a good method for reutilising wastes, however a lot of NH3 is \n\nvolatilised to the atmosphere during this process \n\n\u2022 Biogas production from animal wastes \n\n \n\n3. Fossil fuel sources: the emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx) to the atmosphere \n\nfrom fossil fuel combustion is an important source of N, most of which is \n\ndeposited onto the landscape in rain and as dry deposition. In the US, the \n\ndeposition of N from fossil fuel combustion is the major input of N to most \n\ncoastal rivers and bays on the eastern seafront through export from their \n\n\n\n 42\n\nwatersheds. NOx emissions are critical to ozone and smog formation in the lower \n\nportions of the atmosphere, and also contribute towards acid rain \n\n\u2022 Encouraging less driving and the use of more energy efficient vehicles \n\n\u2022 Employing stricter emission standards to larger vehicles, especially trucks and \n\noff-road vehicles, is also significant.  \n\n\u2022 The generation of electricity from fuel cells rather than traditional combustion \n\nmethods would completely cancel out NOx emissions from that source \n\n \n\n4. Urban and suburban sources: sewage and other urban sources (especially human \n\nwastes) are very significant to the N loads in many coastal rivers and bays. \n\nTreatment beyond the secondary type (biological oxygen demand) is necessary \n\nto remove the N from these wastes \n\n\u2022 The separation of storm sewers from sanitary sewers allows for further treatment \n\nof each, including using artificial wetlands \n\n\u2022 Increasing water storage capacity of the combined sewers \n\n \n\n5. Enhancing N sinks: wetlands, ponds and riparian zones are particularly effective \n\nat trapping N that serve to sediment out particulate N as well as converting \n\nreactive biologically available N into harmless N2 gas through denitrification. \n\nEnhancing them would increased the benefits that can be gained \n\n\u2022 Conversion to wetlands a portion of the river basins that are a source of \n\npollution to the rivers and the reestablishment of the flow of water through these \n\nwetlands could also have an important role in reducing N to the coast. \n\n \n\n\n\n 43\n\nThe cost for implementing strategies to reduce N inputs may be considerable. For \n\nexample, the potential cost for reducing the levels of N from only point sources in the \n\nLong Island Sound (USA) watershed as estimated in 1998 would be about 2.5 billion \n\nUS dollars (Bricker et al 1999). \n\n \n\n \n\n4.5 Technical approaches for the removal of phosphorus from wastewaters \n\n \n\nMany of the solutions for N reduction discussed in the previous section also apply to P, \n\nbut specific technologies apply for the removal of P in wastewater. The treatment of \n\nwastewater is necessary before its discharge into the environment, and the removal of P \n\nis essential. Present treatments remove it by converting the ions in the wastewater into a \n\nsolid fraction. Several methods are available for carrying out this process (de-Bashan \n\nand Bashan 2004): \n\n \n\n1. Precipitation of P with metal salts: chemical precipitations with iron, alum, or \n\nlime are the main commercial processes currently used for P removal through \n\nadsorption and precipitation. Calcium-phosphorus precipitation is a commonly \n\nused method because of its low cost and easy handling, and may also be used as \n\na pre-treatment of urban wastewaters before treatment by biological processes \n\n \n\n2. Biological removal of P by the use of microorganisms in bioreactors \n\n\u2022 Certain strains of cyanobacteria, purple non-sulphur bacteria, and \n\nStaphylococcus are able to remove P from wastewater when grown in batch \n\nreactors or when immobilised on cellulose or ceramic beads. \n\n\n\n 44\n\n\u2022 Suspensions of microalgae immobilised in alginate beads used in combination \n\nwith plant growth-promoting bacteria can remove a significant proportion of \n\nphosphate as well as ammonium ions. \n\n\u2022 Enhanced biological P removal (EBPR) is a method that takes advantage of \n\nbacteria that have the capable of internally accumulating biopolymers during \n\nperiods when the environment is unfavourable and utilise them as during \n\ncarbon-rich phases. This capacity is applied to the release of orthophosphate \n\nfrom the wastewater and the sludge in treatment plants and its uptake into the \n\nbacterial cells. This technique is the most efficient of the biological methods, \n\nand also stimulates the growth of denitrifying P removing bacteria, thereby \n\nremoving both P and N together. \n\n \n\n3. Constructed wetlands through which wastewaters are made to flow are another \n\nmethod for the removal of P and its uptake into plant biomass \n\n \n\n4. Recovery of P from the sludge of wastewater treatment plants and its use as \n\nfertiliser can be used presently only for sludge from biological nutrient removal \n\nas other commercial processes remove P along with undesirable compounds. \n\nThe most promising compound for recovery from wastewater plants is struvite \n\n(ammonium phosphate hexahydrate), containing both P and N, for use as a \n\nfertiliser. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 45\n\n4.6 Mariculture waste management \n\n \n\nShellfish and finfish mariculture, carried out in the open ocean on lines, and in cages in \n\nfarmed areas, areas, are the two main types carried out commercially. Sites for \n\nmariculture are chosen based on hydrodynamic conditions and infrastructure to optimise \n\nthe growth rate of the cultivated species, while ensuring appropriate flushing of the \n\nfarmed area and sufficient depth that prevents deposition of wastes that would reduce \n\nwater and bottom quality. If the chosen site does not allow proper water circulation, \n\nsubmarine blowers can be used to disperse the residues or finfish cages can be \n\nsuspended from single moorings (Buschmann et al 2008). \n\n \n\n \n\n4.6.1 Ecological engineering of mariculture \n\n \n\nThe aim of ecological engineering is to prevent adverse effects on the environment from \n\nhuman activities or to recover from these effects. To avoid disruption from the \n\nintroduction of aquaculture species into coastal areas, the comparative abundance of \n\norganisms that have differing ecosystem functions can be balanced using new \n\ntechnologies in this field. The rotation of farming sites would allow for their recovery \n\nwith time (Buschmann et al 2008). \n\n \n\nFish provide an ecological service, and the farming sites could serve as nurseries as well \n\nas refuges. The coupled use of such sites as both farming areas and refuges. The \n\ncoupled use of such sites as both farming areas and reserves requires a large amount of \n\ninformation that varies from area to area. Potential interactions of wild fish and other \n\n\n\n 46\n\nspecies (especially predators) should be considered. Another emerging method for \n\nreducing wastes is the development of artificial reefs in which a significant biomass of \n\nextracting organisms would be important. Artificial reefs also provide a habitat for \n\ndiverse organisms having different ecological functions and services. Since the reefs \n\nwould be placed on the bottom of the faming site, where the water quality is reduced \n\nand light limited, algal growth would be limited and because of this, biofiltration may \n\nnot be increased. Further testing will be required before this method can be \n\nimplemented (Buschmann et al 2008). \n\n \n\nFor the use of these approaches, regulatory and financial incentives are necessary to \n\nrecognise their benefits. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.6.2 Integrated multitrophic aquaculture (IMTA) \n\n \n\nIntegrated mariculture is bioremediation using integrated concepts to restore water \n\nquality to its natural state (Troell et al 2003). The development of open IMTA systems \n\nrequires well-established knowledge of the oceanographic features of a water body used \n\nfor aquaculture, which can be used for determining the impact of the IMTA layout in \n\nreducing wastes. For this purpose, coastal water circulation models are important, along \n\nwith complementary models. \n\n \n\n\u2018Bag\u2019 techniques for aquaculture that isolate an operation from its surroundings by \n\ndeveloping closed systems at sea, though useful, have not as yet been applied on a \n\ncommercial scale due to cost and technological issues. This technique would not \n\n\n\n 47\n\ndischarge the waste generated into the sea and would be contained within the closed \n\nsystems (Buschmann et al 2008). \n\n \n\nLand-based IMTA methods can be inclusive, adaptable to several fish/shrimp, shellfish, \n\nand seaweed culture combinations at any level of intensification (Buschmann et al \n\n2008). Ammonia is the form of N that is released by fish and shellfish in aquaculture, \n\nand this is the preferred N source for seaweeds (Troell et al 2003). High quality edible \n\nseaweed can thus be generated from such systems that can be used as feed for the \n\ncultured fish, which would reduce the pressures on the ecologically important \n\nphanerogams. This land-based method has high economic benefits (Troell et al 2003, \n\nBuschmann et al 2008). \n\n \n\nLand-based recirculation systems that use bacteria as biofilters have a high capacity for \n\ndenitrifying and transforming wastes. This method has not yet developed at the \n\ncommercial stage since bacterial transformation of wastes does not yield any product of \n\ncommercial value, such as the seaweed in IMTA systems, and currently remains \n\ncomplex and costly (Troell et al 2003, Buschmann et al 2008). \n\n \n\nIMTA at sea has been developed as a means of increasing the environmental and \n\neconomic sustainability of marine open-water systems. Unlike land-based IMTA, these \n\nare capable of achieving high efficiency (Buschmann et al 2008). If oxygen levels \n\nremain stable, the particulate matter that settles onto the sediments could be removed \n\nfrom the system by cultivating scavenger organisms of commercial value, such as crabs, \n\nlobsters, and sea cucumbers (Troell et al 2003, Buschmann et al 2008). \n\n \n\n\n\n 48\n\n4.6.3 Biofiltration by plants \n\n \n\nPlant biofilters, being assimilative in nature, can greatly reduce the overall \n\nenvironmental impact of fish culture and stabilise the culture environment. Algae, \n\nespecially seaweeds, are suitable for biofiltration as they are highly productive and have \n\neconomic value (Neori et al 2004). \n\n \n\nBecause of its complexity, biofiltration poses significant financial costs. To raise its \n\nrevenues, the productivity per unit of feed must be increased. The waste nutrients from \n\nthe fish culture are used for the auxiliary production of new plant biomass, which can be \n\nused as feed in shellfish culture, or marketed itself for human consumption, \n\nphycocolloids, feed supplements, agrichemicals, nutraceuticals, and pharmaceuticals. \n\nUlva, Gracilaria, and Porphyra, the most commonly used seaweeds in mariculture \n\nbiofiltration, have been used for these purposes (Neori et al 2004). \n\n \n\nThe ability to remove ammonia from the effluent is a requisite of the seaweed biofilter \n\nspecies, as is resistance to epiphytes and small herbivores. Ulva is the most preferred \n\nspecies in this respect, but once a different species has been selected as the biofilter, \n\nproper management of the culture can lessen the epiphyte problem, such as by filtration. \n\nThe main management aspects are proper harvesting frequency and water flow, changes \n\nin water level, pulse feeding (to promote growth), and a high stocking density. The daily \n\nrate of areal uptake of total N as ammonia is an economically important feature in \n\nseaweed biofilters \u2013 the uptake capacity is inversely proportional to the cost and size of \n\nthe biofiltration system. The uptake efficiency is also an important point (Neori et al \n\n2004). \n\n\n\n 49\n\n \n\nIn open mariculture systems, the efficiency of nutrient uptake by seaweed has been low \n\ndue to the nature of the water flow, and requires further study, though saline aquaculture \n\neffluents can also be treated using this method through land-based recirculation. This \n\ntechnique removes P from effluents as well, though to a smaller extent than N (Neori et \n\nal 2004). \n\n\n\n 50\n\nCHAPTER 5:  OVERVIEW OF LOICZ BUDGETS DATABASE A?D CASE \n\nSTUDIES \n\n \n\n5.1 An overview of the LOICZ budget database \n\n \n\nThe Land \u2013 Ocean Interactions in the Coastal Zone (LOICZ) has a catalogued database \n\nof sites around the world where the budgeting method has been applied. An analysis of \n\nthis database has provided a profile of the number of sites over each continent (figure \n\n5.1), with the global distribution as shown in figure 5.2.  \n\n \n\nA very small proportion of the budgeted sites were shown to have balanced production, \n\nwhere, through the LOICZ budgeting procedure, the system was found to be neither a \n\nsource of nor a sink for nutrients. The autotrophic and heterotrophic sites are present in \n\nthe ratio of 1.277, and their distribution is as shown in figures 5.3 and 5.4.  \n\n \n\nAmong these sites are those that have been budgeted twice \u2013 4 in Asia (Calaug Bay, \n\nManila Bay, San Miguel Bay, and BangPakong Bay), and 4 in Europe (Bothnian Bay, \n\nBothnian Sea, Baltic Proper, and S\u2019Ena Arrubia Lagoon): \n\n\u2022 Calaug Bay in the Philippines was budgeted in 1999 and 2000 and was found to \n\nbe heterotrophic both times. \n\n\u2022 Manila Bay, The Philippines, was found to be heterotrophic in both 1998 and \n\n2000. More attention was given to waste loading in 2000 than in the earlier year. \n\n\u2022 San Miguel Bay, The Philippines, was budgeted in 1999 and 2000, and was \n\nautotrophic on both occasions. \n\n\n\n 51\n\n\u2022 BangPakong Estuary in Thailand was found to be heterotrophic in both the years \n\nit was budgeted, and the nutrient sources were better described in 1999 than in \n\n1997. \n\n\u2022 The Bothnian Bay and Bothnian Sea in Europe were both autotrophic when \n\nbudgeted in 1997 and 2001. \n\n\u2022 The Baltic Proper in Europe was autotrophic when budgeted in 1997, but found \n\nto be mildly heterotrophic upon the budgeting in 2001. \n\n\u2022 S\u2019Ena Arrubia Lagoon in Italy was budgeted in 1994 and 1995 and was \n\nautotrophic. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1: Global distribution and trophic status of budgeted sites \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nA\nfr\nic\na\n\nA\nsi\na\n\nA\nus\ntr\nal\nia\n\nC\nen\ntr\nal\n A\nm\ner\nic\na/\n M\nex\nic\no\n\nE\nur\nop\ne\n\nN\nor\nth\n A\nm\ner\nic\na\n\nO\nce\nan\nia\n/ N\new\n Z\nea\nla\nnd\n\nS\nou\nth\n A\nm\ner\nic\na\n\nGeographical location\n\nN\nu\nm\nb\ne\nr \no\nf \nb\nu\nd\ng\ne\nte\nd\n s\nit\ne\ns\n\nAutotrophic\n\nHeterotrophic\n\nBalanced production\n\n\n\n 52\n\nFigure 5.2:  Map of budgeted sites around the world \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3: Map of autotrophic sites around the world \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 53\n\nFigure 5.4: Map of heterotrophic sites around the world \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n5.2 ?ew developments in the use of nutrient budgets \n\n \n\n5.2.1. Application to muddy systems \n\n \n\nMany coastal ecosystems around the world contain high levels of sediment, either \n\nnaturally or through human intervention. The presence of such sediments (or mud) in \n\nthese waters lowers the quantity of light that penetrates through, decreasing the rate of \n\nprimary productivity in that system, and through this controlling life in that water \n\ncolumn. The flux of nutrients between the sediments and the water column is controlled \n\nby bacteria, and the partition coefficient that plays a major role in the partitioning \n\nbetween particulate and dissolved forms of P is controlled by mud suspension. A new \n\nLOICZ budget model was developed for application to estuaries with muddy waters. \n\n\n\n 54\n\nWith the use of this new model, the sensitivity and health of such estuaries can be \n\nascertained (LOICZ Deltas). \n\n \n\n5.2.2. Link to ASSETS \n\n \n\nSimple biogeochemical models, such as nutrient budgets that provide descriptions of the \n\nbiochemical and ecological dynamics of estuaries, are utilised in determining the degree \n\nof sensitivity of an estuary to external drivers since field observations on their own may \n\nnot be sufficient to describe the system without the understanding of an fundamental \n\nmechanism occurring in that system. (Swaney et al 2008). The assessment of estuarine \n\ntrophic status (ASSETS) utilises this to learn the health of the system, as well as its \n\nsensitivity to an increase or decrease in external nutrient loads. \n\n \n\n5.2.3. Link to conceptual diagrams \n\n \n\nConceptual diagrams aid in the understanding of processes related to the transformation \n\nof N and P in coastal and other waters (Hamilton et al), and provide insights into how \n\necosystems respond to global changes (IGBP). Conceptual diagrams also find use in \n\nsetting up appropriate monitoring programmes, and identifying management priorities \n\n(IAN). It is a tool that can therefore be used in conjunction with nutrient budgets in the \n\nmanagement of nutrient enrichment. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 55\n\n5.2.3. Link to fisheries \n\n \n\nThe nutrient dynamics of an ecosystem are important for productive fisheries in \n\nsustaining phytoplankton and peak rates of primary production in the spring. Upwelling \n\nthat occurs during the summer/winter monsoon provides an allochthonous source of P \n\nrelative to N (Liu et al 2009), and this may reduce any limiting effects of the nutrients \n\non phytoplankton growth. Large-scale aquaculture aquaculture also discharges \n\nconsiderable quantities of nutrients into the surrounding waters. While nutrients are lost \n\nfrom the ecosystem through commercial and recreational fisheries, an input of nutrients \n\nmay result in algal blooms that have detrimental effects on aquatic life. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.3 Case study: S\u2019Ena Arrubia lagoon, Italy. \n\n \n\nS\u2019Ena Arrubia lagoon is located along the centre-western coast of Sardinia, Italy (39.83 \n\n\u00b0N and 8.57 \u00b0E). It is 1.2 km2 wide, has a mean depth of 40 cm, and is the residue of the \n\nwider Sassu Pond that was reclaimed in 1937 (Trebini et al information sheet). \n\n \n\nFreshwater is input from the watersheds of two canals: Rio Sant\u2019Anna that drains an \n\narea of 78.4 km2, and the Canale delle aquae basse, which drains an area of 50 km2 that \n\nis extensively utilised for farming and zootechnics. The lagoon communicates with the \n\nsea through a channel. The climate of this region is mediterranean with long, hot \n\nsummers and short, mild, and rainy winters. Precipitation, averaging 65 cm annually, is \n\nlow, and therefore the level of the water flowing into the lagoon is also low (Trebini et \n\nal information sheet). \n\n\n\n 56\n\n \n\nThe lagoon is highly eutrophic and dystrophic crises and fish kills occasionally occur. \n\nIntense phytoplankton blooms occur in the spring when terrestrial runoff is the highest \n\n(Fiocca et al 1996, Trebini et al information sheet), especially from Cyclotella  atomus \n\n(Husted) and Chlorella sp. Macroalgae, consisting mostly of Ulva sp. And \n\nEnteromorpha flexuosa (K\u00fctzing) DeToni, become abundant in late spring to summer \n\n(Fiocca et al 1996, Trebini et al information sheet) and, having a high affinity for N, \n\nmay compete with the development of the phytoplankton (Fiocca et al 1996). \n\n \n\nThe N:P ratio is low in the spring-summer period (Fiocca et al 1996,Trebini et al \n\ninformation sheet), and very high having abrupt peaks in the autumn-winter periods. \n\nThese dynamics are dependent on the quantity and the way water is input from the \n\nCanale delle aquae basse, which provides a substantial percentage of the freshwater \n\nflowing into the lagoon. High fluctuations in oxygen levels are also characteristic \n\n(Trebini et al information sheet). \n\n \n\nThe lagoon is a Ramsar site that is included in its listing for important bird areas. It is a \n\nwintering and nesting area for several species of waterfowl. It and also has great \n\nimportance for its fauna. The main human activities in this wetland are fishing (which is \n\neconomically important), outdoor recreation, and educational and scientific research \n\n(Trebini et al 2005, Trebini et al information sheet). \n\n \n\nThrough the application of the LOICZ (Land-Ocean Interactions in the Coastal Zone) \n\nmodel to this lagoon, it was observed that there is a general trend for the prevalence of \n\nnutrient storing processes over nutrient mobilisation, and that N fixation dominates over \n\n\n\n 57\n\ndenitrification. Production appears to be the dominant process over most of the year. \n\nThese results prove that in terms of its net metabolism, S\u2019Ena Arrubia lagoon is to be \n\nconsidered autotrophic (Trebini et al information sheet). \n\n \n\nOn many counts, coastal lagoons are characterised by large nutrient inputs from \n\nanthropogenic sources and also by limited seawater exchange, low water turnover, and \n\nlong residence time. Because these systems are ecologically and economically \n\nimportant, several attempts have been made to improve their water quality by increasing \n\ntidal flushing. The sea mouth was widened in 2000 using engineering means to improve \n\nits flushing and hydrodynamics and reduce the high trophic levels. The change in the \n\nlagoon morphology was expected to better the water exchange, lower nutrient \n\nconcentrations, and limit algal blooms (Trebini et al 2005). \n\n \n\nWhen the conditions of the system before and after modification were compared, a larger \n\nnumber of higher salinity values was recorded after. Differences in the species of \n\nphytoplankton present were observed. The LOICZ model drew attention to the residence \n\ntimes of the water in the lagoon before and after the widening of the sea mouth. On the \n\ncontrary, there was no relevant difference in the total and reactive P concentrations or in \n\nthe concentrations of the various inorganic forms of N between the two periods. The \n\nexpected reductions in nutrient exchange were not observed probably because the lagoon \n\nstill receives heavy inputs from the catchments. The widening of the sea mouth in systems \n\nwith high trophic levels might make its environmental conditions more marine, which \n\nwould seriously modify the system\u2019s ecology (Trebini et al 2005). \n\n \n\n\n\n 58\n\nTrebini et al (2005) have suggested that for proper management of the S\u2019Ena Arrubia \n\nlagoon, it is necessary to first ascertain what the lagoon is to be used for, and then \n\napply suitable strategies to achieve this. Data has to be established on important \n\necosystem variables to (1) enable the correct availability of fresh water and \n\npermissible nutrient inputs to the lagoon to maintain a good level of fish production \n\n(2) define the quantity of water that should be exchanged with the sea to obtain good \n\nvivification of water and avoid anoxia. However, the great variability in the structural \n\ncomponents of such systems makes it impossible to accurately predict the results and \n\nconsequences of any particular management strategy. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.4 Case study: Sacca di Goro lagoon, Italy \n\n \n\nThe Po river drains a large part of northern Italy, an area with a surface of 67000 km2 \n\nand about 17 million inhabitants. The Po di Volano canal-Sacca di Goro lagoon is a \n\nsmall hydrographic system partially located in the southern portion of the Po delta, and \n\naccounts for about 1% of the total area of the Po river catchment. Only the eastern \n\nportion of the watershed belongs to the delta, whereas the western portion is for most \n\npart a human-regulated system that is the outcome of a reclamation that is centuries old. \n\nThe entire Sacca di Goro watershed is located in an area that lies below sea level \n\n(Viaroli et al 2006). \n\n \n\nThe Po di Volano-Sacca di Goro watershed has an area of 860 km2 and is composed of \n\nthree sub-basins: the Po di Volano, the Canal Bianco, and the Giralda canals. All these \n\nthree sub-basins are human-regulated, and the Canal Bianco and the Giralda are \n\n\n\n 59\n\npartially connected with the Po di Volano. Freshwater inflow is partially independent of \n\nprecipitation as the overall hydrographic system is human-regulated. During the rainy \n\nperiod, from late summer through late spring, the canals are kept empty in order to \n\navoid the risk of flooding. In the summer, the drainage system is filled with fresh water \n\nthat was released from the Po di Goro river for irrigation purposes. The water that \n\ndrains from the agricultural systems is then delivered to the Po di Volano, the Canal \n\nBianco, and the Giralda that leads to summer peaks of freshwater discharge into the \n\nlagoon (Viaroli et al 2006). \n\n \n\nThe Sacca di Goro lagoon is a shallow water embayment of the Po river delta (44?47\u2019-\n\n44?50\u2019 N and 12?15\u2019-12?20\u2019 E). The lagoon is surrounded by embankments and \n\nfreshwater input is mainly from the Po di Volano, the Canal Bianco, and the Giralda \n\ncanals. The average water retention time ranges from 1-4 days, although stagnation can \n\noccur in the sheltered portions. Water is presently exchanged between the lagoon and \n\nthe adjacent Adriatic Sea through two sea mouths in the southern sand barrier. The \n\nSacca di Goro, with minor aquatic ecosystems, is important for the protection and \n\nconservation of waterfowl (Viaroli et al 2006). \n\n \n\nThe population density of the Po di Volano watershed is relatively low, and has been \n\nnegatively inclined during the last decade. The main economic activities are agriculture \n\n(utilising 80% of the watershed) and aquaculture. Changes are occurring in the \n\nagricultural and zootechnical practices as a result of the population decrease. Pesticides \n\nand fertilisers are used in crop cultivation, and that of rice requires flooded soils, which \n\nkeeps the pesticides and fertilisers in solution, thereby increasing the risk of pollution to \n\n\n\n 60\n\nthe lagoon. Livestock is of minor relevance because of a decline in poultry and cattle \n\nrearing (Viaroli et al 2006). \n\n \n\nSacca di Goro is currently one of the best production sites in Europe for the Manila \n\nclam Tapes philippinarum turning out an annual crop of several thousand tonnes. This \n\noccupation generates a high economic income of 50-100 million euros each year. \n\nThrough the year, young clams (5-10mm in shell length) are collected from along the \n\nsouthern sand barrier and sown in the licensed areas of the lagoon. The clams grow to \n\ncommercial size within a few months because of the high food availability. Market \n\ndemand determines the quantities harvested. As the clams are harvested by manual \n\ndredging, this causes alterations at those points in the natural stratification of the \n\nsediment, and also an increase in sediment resuspension, nutrient release and the \n\nmobility of reduced compounds (Bartoli et al 2001, Viaroli et al 2006). Massive clam \n\nmortality has occurred due to blooms of Ulva rigida and related events. Evidence from \n\nresearch has shown that clams themselves can play a role in oxygen depletion and \n\nincreasing organic nutrient cycling and the deposition of organic matter in the surface \n\nsediments, which stimulates sulphide production through the reduction of sulphate. In \n\nthe farmed areas of the lagoon, the sediment was enriched with biogenic carbonates that \n\nare recognised in the control of P recycling through adsorption and coprecipitation. The \n\ndominance of the clams within the community also caused other organisms to be \n\ndisplaced with the loss of their associated functions (Viaroli et al 2006). \n\n \n\nThe green nitrophilous seaweed Ulva rigida has replaced the original vegetation of \n\nSacca di Goro that was composed mainly of submerged aquatic phanerogams, for \n\nwhich N loading was considered responsible. Blooms of the red macroalga Gracilaria \n\n\n\n 61\n\nverrucosa were important during the late 80s and early 90s and that of the Cladophora \n\nspecies occurred in the summers of 1996-98, whereas at other times monospecific \n\nUlva blooms dominated. With favourable climatic conditions, Ulva reached its \n\nmaximum biomass, followed by a sudden collapse of the mats that decomposed \n\ncausing anoxia and the release of sulphide into the water column. A general principle \n\nis that the relative abundance of the main nutrients, especially N, controls the \n\nmacroalgal productivity and the onset of biomass collapse. In systems with high \n\nnitrate input like the Sacca di Goro, the nitrate was considered one of the key factors \n\nin controlling macroalgal blooms. Though the growth of Ulva can also regulate the \n\nretention and recycling of nutrients within the ecosystem, but the N accumulation was \n\nshown to be only a temporary sink. Upon the crash of the biomass, the nutrients are \n\nrapidly recycled (Viaroli et al 2006). \n\n \n\nIn the Sacca di Goro lagoon, the manual harvesting of the clams makes use of rakes to \n\ndredge the sediment. The harvested are represents less than 1% of the entire farmed \n\narea. Field experiments have shown that dredging increased the oxygen demand of the \n\nsediment twenty fold and the levels of ammonia and reactive P approximately 50 and \n\n100 times over (Viaroli et al 2006). Carbon dioxide, ammonia, reactive P, and silica \n\nfluxes were all strongly stimulated by the presence of the clams. This happens because \n\nof the reducing conditions at the sediment surface that get established with the \n\nexcretion and rapid degradation of organic matter at the sediment-water interface. \n\nSilica was regenerated about nine times faster probably from the feeding of the clams \n\non silicaceous diatoms and active bacterial metabolism of the excreted matter (Bartoli \n\net al 2001). \n\n \n\n\n\n 62\n\nThe overall metabolism of this lagoon was analysed using the LOICZ biogeochemical \n\nmodel. The residence time of the water ranged from 1-4 days, depending on inputs of \n\nfreshwater and exchanges between the adjacent sea. Data for 1997 demonstrate that the \n\ninternal fluxes of DIP and DIN correspond to the seasonal trend of macroalgal nutrient \n\nuptake during the growth phase and release during the subsequent disintegration. The \n\nnet ecosystem metabolism follows a similar pattern with an autotrophic phase during \n\nalgal growth; however on an annual basis, the lagoon is considered heterotrophic with a \n\nnet ecosystem metabolism of about - 50 mmol Cm-2 d-1 (Viaroli et al 2006). \n\n \n\nFor the mitigation of water circulation in the lagoon, the canals were dredged (Viaroli et \n\nal 2006). A short-term bloom alleviation strategy used is to harvest the Ulva biomass when \n\nit approaches the threshold level, and Cellina et al (2003) suggest the use of a larger \n\nnumber vessels for this purpose as soon as the threshold is reached as it is more efficient in \n\ncontrolling anoxic crises and more economic. Organic alternatives for the agriculture \n\npractised on the watershed are promising ecologically and financially (Viaroli et al 2006). \n\n \n\n \n\n5.5 Case Study: Budget analysis for the Mandovi Estuary \u2013 Goa, India \n\n \n\nThe budgeting method has earlier been applied to the Mandovi estuary located in Goa, \n\nIndia, as catalogued in the LOICZ database. The analysis has been repeated using data \n\ncollected from literary sources:  \n\n \n\nEstuaries are an important part of the watershed-coastal zone continuum, and are \n\naffected by both natural and anthropogenic forcing. The Mandovi estuary (15\u00ba28\u2019N; \n\n\n\n 63\n\n73\u00ba52\u2019E) (figure 5.5) is a tide - dominated estuary, situated in the state of Goa on the \n\nwestern coast of India, which drains into the Arabian Sea (i.e. the north-western Indian \n\nOcean). It has, on the average, an area of about 29 km2 and a depth of 5 m2 (Alagarsamy \n\n2006). The estuary has thick mangrove forests, and several small streams that originate \n\nin the Sahyadri Hills empty into this region. The hydrological characteristics of the \n\nestuary are steered by the monsoon regime (Alagarsamy 2006) and a majority of the \n\nfreshwater discharge occurs only during the southwest monsoon (June \u2013 October), the \n\nrunoff during the remaining months being almost negligible (Kessarkar et al 2010). \n\nGoa is a significant source of iron ore and ferromanganese in India, and the mining and \n\nexport of these minerals play an important role in the state\u2019s economy. The estuarine \n\nchannel of the Mandovi is used for transportation of the mined minerals by barges to the \n\nMormugao Harbour on the coastal Arabian Sea. Mining and industrial activities \n\ndischarge nutrients, heavy metals, and inorganic and organic industrial wastes into the \n\nestuary (Kessarkar et al 2010). The estuary also receives municipal and agricultural \n\nwastes from the urban and farmed portions of the watershed. Other conspicuous \n\nactivities in the estuary include the navigation by fishing trawlers, passenger ferries, and \n\nrecreational activities such as boat cruises and casinos for tourists. \n\n \n\nThe Arabian Sea, being semi-enclosed, has a climate, hydrography and circulation, and \n\nbiogeochemical processes that are not commonly observed. It has zones of upwelling, \n\nwith widespread open-sea and coastal oxygen deficiency. NO3\n- was observed by Naqvi \n\net al to be present in high concentrations in the euphotic zone of the western Indian \n\nshelf, where primary production was high only at the surface. The production of \n\nreactive nitrogen has also been on the rise in south Asia in the last few decades, due to \n\nwhich the level of atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic nitrogen into the northern \n\n\n\n 64\n\nIndian Ocean is among the highest globally (Naqvi et al 2010). This may lead to the \n\nintrusion of seawater into estuaries that is already high in N and P, hence increasing \n\ntheir nutrient loads. \n\n \n\nThis study focuses on inferring the metabolism of the Mandovi estuary by utilising the \n\nmodified Land \u2013 Ocean Interactions in the Coastal Zone (LOICZ) biogeochemical \n\nmodel for muddy systems to construct hydrographic budgets for the estuary. The \n\nparameters used for construction of the nutrient budgets are presented in table 5.1. The \n\nestuary has an average salinity of 25 ppt during the dry season, and 18.85 ppt during the \n\nwet season. The higher salinity during the dry season is due to heightened evaporation, \n\nlowered freshwater input from the tributaries, and seawater intrusion. The estuary is \n\nwell mixed throughout the year (Divya et al 2009) and is therefore considered to be \n\nsingle \u2013 layered. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.5: River Mandovi on the west coast of India (adapted from Alagarsamy 2006) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 65\n\n5.5.1. Water and salt balances: \n\n \n\nThe water and salt budgets for the Mandovi estuary in the dry and wet seasons are \n\nillustrated in figure 5.6. Freshwater inputs to the estuary, and residual and mixing flows \n\nwere estimated from the salt balance. The volume of water entering the system during \n\nthe dry season was observed to be slightly higher than the residual flow, whereas during \n\nthe wet season, they are balanced. The freshwater influx of 0.162% during the dry \n\nseason and 1.502% during the wet season indicates that sea water intrusion into the \n\nsystem is predominant throughout the year. Inflow of freshwater is through precipitation \n\n(Vp), while other sources, such as groundwater (Vg) and other (Vo), were not \n\nconsidered significant. As compared to the freshwater flow, the degrees of precipitation \n\nover and evaporation from the estuary were not significant. The water residence time \n\nvaried from 60.97 days during the dry season to 2.45 days during the wet season. \n\n \n\n5.5.2. Budgets of nonconservative materials: \n\n \n\nThe nonconservative fluxes for dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) and dissolved \n\ninorganic nitrogen (DIN) and stoichiometrically derived net apparent biogeochemical \n\nprocesses in the Mandovi estuary are given in table 2. The system appears to be \n\nautotrophic in both seasons, but denitrifying during the dry season and nitrogen fixing \n\nduring the wet season. There is a net loss in ?DIP in both seasons, which is attributed to \n\norganic matter regeneration processes. The net ecosystem metabolism (NEM) is high \n\nduring the wet season, with p-r = 4.89 x 103 mmol m2 d-1, and the value obtained for \n\n0fix \u2013 Denit is 33.2 mmol m-2 d-1. From this, the system appears to be a sink for DIP \n\nand DIN during the wet season. \n\n\n\n 66\n\n \n\n5.5.3. Management of nutrient enrichment: \n\n \n\nPossible strategies that may be used to mitigate nutrient loads in this estuary are:  \n\n\u2022 Monitoring and assessment of the ecological status of the estuary, with the \n\ndetermination of the appropriate target to be achieved.  \n\n\u2022 Formulation of plans for the management of both N and P that are suited to each \n\nsector (urban/agricultural/industrial wastes), such as the treatment of industrial \n\nand urban wastes by biological means, the use of treatment ponds, precipitation, \n\nand the use of cover plants and buffer/riparian zones in cultivated sections of the \n\nwatershed. \n\n\u2022 Intervention on point sources, with a focus on those that can be easily controlled. \n\nAn instance is in the production of biogas from solid wastes from urban and \n\nagricultural sources. \n\n\u2022 Budgeting of the estuary after a period of a few years would prove the efficiency \n\nof the management plans put into action. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 67\n\nTable 5.1: Parameters used in the construction of the nutrient budgets \n\nParameters Dry Season Wet Season \n\nPrecipitation         \n\n(mm mo-1) 0.004135 [a] 0.5931 [a] \n\nEvaporation     \n\n(annual average) 485 [b] 485 [b] \n\nRiver discharge      \n\n(m3 yr-1) 189.216 x 106 [c] 8136.288 x 106 [c] \n\nSystem box (average) 25 [c] System box (average) 18.85 [c] \n\nOuter box  (average) 36.25 [d] Outer box  (average) 36.2 [d] \n\nSalinity             \n\n(ppt) \n\n \n\n River discharge points 12.6 [e] River discharge points 0.11 [e] \n\nSystem box 0.81 [f] System box 12.99 [f] \n\nOuter box 1 [d] Outer box 1 [d] \n\nDIN                        \n\n(\u00b5mol l-1) \n\n \n\n River discharge points 1.59 [f] River discharge points 15.63 [f] \n\nSystem box 0.22 [f] System box 1 [f] \n\nOuter box 4 [d] Outer box  (Arabian Sea) 3 [d] \n\nDIP                        \n\n(\u00b5mol l-1) \n\n \n\n River discharge points 0.36 [f] River discharge points 0.68 [f] \n\nSystem box 8 [g] System box 13 [g] \n\nOuter box 12 [h] Outer box 16.8 [h] \n\nSPM                          \n\n(mg l-1) \n\n \n\n River discharge points ?D [g] River discharge points 13 [g] \n\n \n\n[a] CWC 2005; [b] Legates and Mather 1992; [c] Vijith et al 2009; [d] Morrison et al 1998; [e] Divya et \n\nal 2009;  [f] Maya et al 2010; [g] Kessarkar et al 2010; [h] Bhaskar and Bhosle 2006.                                                                   \n\nND \u2013 not detected. \n\n\n\n 68\n\nTable 5.2: Nonconservative nutrients and stoichimetrically derived net apparent \n\nbiogeochemical processes in the Mandovi estuary during the dry and wet seasons \n\nSeason M DIP        \n\n(103 mol d-1) \n\nM DI?            \n\n(103 mol d-1) \n\np-r                    \n\n(103 mol m-2 d-1) \n\n?fix-Denit                         \n\n(103 mol m-2 d-1) \n\nDry -6.638 -0.746 703.644 3.64 \n\nWet -46.14 245.32 4890.935 33.92 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.6: Water and salt budgets for Mandovi estuary during dry and wet seasons.              \n\nWater flux in 103 m3 d\u20131 and salt flux in 106 PSU m3 d\u20131. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 69\n\nTable 3: Summary of results obtained using the modified LOICZ budget for muddy \n\nsystems \n\nResult Dry season Wet season Unit \n\nInflow from land: 0.5184 22.291 103 m3 d\u20131 \n\nRain inflow to estuary, Vp: 0.003 0.554 103 m3 d\u20131 \n\nWater loss from estuary by \n\nevaporation, Ve \n\n0.038 0.038 103 m3 d\u20131 \n\nAdvective water loss from the \n\nestuary, Vr \n\n0.482 22.806 103 m3 d\u20131 \n\nDiffusive inflow from coastal \n\nwaters, Vx \n\n1.895 36.323 103 m3 d\u20131 \n\nMean residence time 60.97 2.45 Days \n\n1-Kd in river 1.00 0.85  \n\n1-Kd in estuary 0.9 0.85  \n\n1-Kd in coastal waters 0.86 0.81  \n\n?Kd river to estuary 0.10 0.00  \n\n?Kd coastal water to estuary -0.04 -0.04  \n\nInflow DIP from land 0.186 15.158  \n\nEffective DIP inflow from \n\nland \n\n0.167 15.158 River flux d-1 \n\nAdvective DIP loss from \n\nestuary \n\n1.019 45.613 Residual flux d-1 \n\nDiffusive DIP inflow from \n\ncoastal waters \n\n7.489 76.596 Mixing flux d-1 \n\nDelta DIP = Net budget of \n\nDIP for estuary \n\n-6.638 -46.14 103 moles d-1 \n\nInflow DIN from land 0.824 348.411 Inflow d-1 \n\nEffective DIN inflow from \n\nland \n\n0.741 348.411 River flux d-1 \n\nAdvective DIN loss from \n\nestuary \n\n0.437 \n\n \n\n159.533 \n\n \n\nResidual flux d-1 \n\nDiffusive DIN inflow from \n\ncoastal waters \n\n0.441 -344.199 Mixing flux d-1 \n\nDelta DIN=Net budget of DIN \n\nfor estuary \n\n-0.746 245.32 103 moles d-1 \n\np-r  = net ecosystem \n\nmetabolism \n\n703.644 4890.935 103 moles d-1 \n\nnfix \u2013 denit 3.64 33.92 mmol/m2/day \n \n\n\n\n 70\n\nCHAPTER 6: DISCUSSIO? \n\n \n\nEutrophication has been a threat to the health and stability of coastal aquatic systems for \n\nseveral years.  While nutrient and organic matter enrichment of coastal waters can occur \n\nas a result of natural processes, it has been greatly accelerated by various human \n\nactivities. \n\n \n\nFrom the definitions of eutrophication listed in chapter 2, section 2.1, the common \n\nfactor causing the cascade of effects that follow is the high input of plant growth \n\npromoting nutrients, especially N and P, from anthropogenic sources. Monitoring of \n\nsusceptible systems for the appropriate biological indicators is a necessary step in \n\nmanaging responses to excess nutrient loading. High chl a and the presence of \n\nmacroalgae are initial indicators, and monitoring for these indicators should be constant \n\nwith investigation into their occurrence once they are observed. Though care should be \n\ntaken when interpreting the concentration of chl a.  \n\n \n\nThe character of the coastal zone varies from region to region. The extent to which N \n\nloading encourages eutrophication differs between marine systems because \n\nsusceptibility to eutrophication is controlled by several factors such as size, \n\nmorphology, and flushing and residence times. Systems receiving very high loads of N \n\nmay develop other nutrient limitations, as described by Paerl and Piehler (2008). \n\nTemperature variation also plays an important role, whether as temperature differences \n\nbetween seasons or between climates. This is because it can influence the rate of release \n\nor metabolism of nutrients from sources within the system itself (i.e. the sediments and \n\nsuspended organic matter) and thus changing the balance of nutrient availability. \n\n\n\n 71\n\nTemperature can also alter which organisms grow optimally, and lower the oxygen \n\nholding capacity of the water (Paerl and Piehler 2008, McQuatters-Gollop et al 2009). \n\nClimate change due to global warming may therefore also have effects similar to that of \n\neutrophication, such as increased algal productivity, altered food webs, shifts in \n\nphytoplankton community composition, and bottom hypoxia (McQuatters-Gollop et al \n\n2009). Coastal variability within systems and between regions would imply that any \n\nsingle control measure may not have sufficient remedial action, and would probably \n\nneed to be used in combination with other measures. With climatic change, it may be \n\npossible to learn management lessons from other regions that have faced similar \n\nsituations.  \n\n \n\n The Redfield ratio of N and P for a system is an average of the internal ratio of the \n\nnutrients found in various algal species in the communities of the coastal system, and so \n\nthe actual ratio of these nutrients in the system waters is determined by the algal \n\ncommunities present there. The average N:P ratio of a system has been used to suggest \n\nthe most likely limiting nutrient by comparing it to the Redfield ratio. A high winter \n\nratio in comparison with the Redfield ratio can also be indicative of eutrophic \n\nconditions. Increased concentrations of N and P in a system decrease the availability of \n\ndissolved Si in the water column. Therefore measuring the concentration of Si in ratio \n\nwith N and P may also be an indication of nutrient enrichment. This provides vital \n\ninformation for nutrient management strategies. But because ecosystem responses to \n\nanthropogenic nutrient loading varies from system to system (and region to region) as \n\nhighlighted by McQuatters-Gollop et al (2009), very similar policies cannot be used in \n\nall cases and have to be adapted to the characteristics of each system. \n\n \n\n\n\n 72\n\nNutrients reach estuaries and other coastal systems from a number of sources, each of \n\nwhich contributes differing levels of nutrients. Nutrient budget analyses can provide a \n\npicture of the relative importance of the various sources, and based on defined reference \n\nlevels for the system, can provide an overall measure of its capacity for nutrient loss. \n\n\u00d6born et al (2003) suggest that the accurate assignment of these sources that add to the \n\nnutrient loads of a system and focussing on management practices to reduce nutrient \n\nloss from these sources during vulnerable times of the year instead of total reductions \n\nmay be more cost-effective to work towards set targets. Budgets at compartment (or \n\nsource) levels would be advantageous in identifying from where the nutrient surpluses \n\narise that would finally contribute the most to the system being monitored (Oenema et \n\nal 2003). \n\n \n\nSalt and water budgets, are especially useful in combination with nutrient budgets, \n\nbecause they allow estimates of average residence and flushing times of the system (Le \n\nTissier et al 2006, Zeldis 2008b). The flushing rate is useful in determining if the system \n\ncan manage the nutrient load delivered to it. The major terms of the water and salt \n\nbudget also suggest the dominant forcing of the system: whether it receives greater \n\ninflow of nutrients from the ocean (including that from upwelling events) or from \n\nriverine inputs (Zeldis 2008b). In the S\u2019Ena Arrubia lagoon, the modification of the sea \n\nmouth did not improve its conditions, which, as stated earlier, may be because the \n\nlagoon still received considerable wastewater from terrestrial sources. The utilisation of \n\nwetlands would be beneficial in achieving improvements. \n\n \n\nNutrient budget exercises, including inferences of net productivity, allow the estimation \n\nof a system\u2019s carrying capacity for aquaculture (such as shellfish or finfish aquaculture). \n\n\n\n 73\n\nBudgets can be useful in comparing between different types of aquaculture and their \n\neffects on the system, and whether they can be developed to take advantage of \n\ncomplementary behaviour in terms of the effects on nutrient removal/enrichment (for \n\nexample, the co-culture of algae or benthic deposit feeders) (Zeldis 2008a). The \n\ninclusion of IMTA, especially benthic feeders, in the Sacca di Goro lagoon would help \n\nto alleviate nutrient conditions. \n\n \n\nNutrient budgets can be credited for being simple and flexible, but as with all \n\nquantitative methods are subject to uncertainty from various sources. Uncertainty in \n\nnutrient budgets might occur from biases and other errors in measurements, and \n\nmonitoring of the inputs and outputs of nutrients through time may afford additional \n\nchecks on the constancy of budgets (Oenema et al 2003). To minimise inconsistencies \n\nand uncertainties when analysing and interpreting nutrient budgets, it is advisable to \n\nobserve standard data conventions and guidelines, to utilise established datasets of \n\nknown quality (where available), and to employ consistent methodology for evaluating \n\nbudgets and their components. \n\n \n\nScrutinising the uncertainties in nutrient budgets may shed light on weak areas in \n\ndetermining cause-effect relationships. Due to variability and ambiguity, budgets should \n\nbe reappraised over several years (Oenema et al 2003) to confirm their conclusions. In \n\naddition, assessing budgets on a longer-term basis may balance the effect of short-term \n\nvariations (lower inputs in some years may be offset by higher nutrient inputs during \n\nother years). The \u201csnapshot\u201d analysis that is often used in budget studies may not have \n\nmuch value in the real world as they can present a fixed view of the situation as opposed \n\nto average behaviour or trends relevant to management (Scoones and Toulmin 1998). \n\n\n\n 74\n\n \n\nNutrient budgets aim to summarise the basic but essential components of complex \n\nsystems and therefore reflects the assumptions and biases of researchers in determining \n\nwhich elements of the system under study are to be investigated in greater depth than \n\nothers. Thus nutrient budgets should not be viewed as final statements on which policies \n\ncan be made, but should be used to promote discussion, bringing assumptions and \n\nuncertainties to the forefront (Scoones and Toulmin 1998). The participation of \n\nstakeholders in the management of coastal systems is essential, and the right incentives \n\nand reasonable alternatives may have to be offered to take remedial action.  \n\n\n\n 75\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY \n\n \n\n \n\n\u00c6rtebjerg, G., J.H.
