S. COPERTINO ET ALLI \n\nPan-American Journal of Aquatic Sciences (2010), 5(2): I-VIII \n\nII \n\nIntroduction \nGlobal Climate Change (GCC) has been at \n\nthe centre of scientific debate during the 21st century \nand has received substantial attention from society, \ngovernments and the private sector worldwide. \nDespite active debate and recognized climate \nuncertainties, the scientific evidences for global \nwarming remains robust and the conclusion that \nhuman activities are affecting the climate cannot be \nundermined (e.g. Schiermeier 2010). Indeed, \nevidences from hundreds of studies are suggesting \nthat the pace and scale of changes and its impacts \nare surpassing the predictions outlined by the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth \nAssessment Report (IPCC 2007) (McMullen &amp; \nJabbour 2009, Hoegh-Guldberg &amp; Bruno 2010, \nNicholls et al. 2010, Stroeve et al. 2011). Global \nClimate Change (GCC) is recognized now as a \nplanetary crisis, which impacts represent an \nunprecedented risk for natural ecosystems and \nhuman civilization. \n\nBecause coastal areas are directly affected \nby sea-level rise, increases in air and sea \ntemperature, exposure to extreme events and ocean \nacidification, these areas will be impacted most \nseverely by the predicted GCC (Trenberth et al. \n2007). However, despite the significance of the \nclimate-related risks affecting the low-lying habitats, \nthe paucity of scientific publications dealing with \nspecific and regional problems is remarkable \n(Nicholls 2007) and coastal and marine systems are \nvastly underrepresented in comparison with \nterrestrial systems (Richardson &amp; Poloczanska 2008, \nHoegh-Guldberg &amp; Bruno 2010). Studies and \npredictions relating to the impacts of climate change \non coastal and marine ecosystems are limited by the \nlack of long-term data, by the lower observational \ncapacity and by a lack of integrated approaches to \nlink diverse aspects of science and society. The lack \nof information at the regional and local scales \nproduces uncertainties about climate, and these \nuncertainties hamper efforts to plan for the future \n(Malone et al. 2010). Furthermore, no coastal and \nmarine region on earth is exempt from \nanthropogenic modifications and impacts that affect \nthe ecosystem equilibrium and capacity to buffer \nclimate change (Halpern et al. 2008).  \n\nBrazil is a globally important country in the \ncontext of climate change. Owing largely to its \nhistorical deforestation rate, the country is the \nworld\u2019s fourth-largest greenhouse-gas emitter \n(Nepstad et al. 2011). Moreover, Brazil depends \nstrongly on its very abundant natural resources. \nBecause of that, the country has therefore great \npotential to contribute to the reduction of GCC risks. \n\nMost of the discussion about Brazil\u2019s contribution to \nmitigate global climate (Santili et al. 2005), as well \nas studies about impacts and vulnerability of natural \necosystems to climate change, has been focussed on \nterrestrial ecosystems (e.g., Salazar et al. 2007, \nLapola et al. 2009). However, the country\u2019s large \ncoastal and marine zones as well as the country\u2019s \nrole in buffering climate change impacts and \nmitigating emissions are still neglected by many \nnational and international climate change forums \nand policies (Copertino 2011). The Brazilian coast, \nas many other coasts, is highly vulnerable to present-\nday climate variability and may be profoundly \nimpacted by the projected climate change (Muehe \n2006, Neves &amp; Muehe 2008). These impacts would \npose serious threats to coastal biodiversity, \necological functions and services to society, \nincluding the coastal zone\u2019s carbon sequestration \ncapacity. However, studies on Brazilian coastal \nvulnerability to GCC were few and isolated, owing \nin part to the fact that the country\u2019s coastal zone is \nvery extensive. \n\nIn an attempt to fill this gap in current \ninformation, a Coastal Zone (CZ) project was \nestablished within the framework and aims of the \nNational Institute of Sciences and Technology \n(INCT) for Climate Change and the Brazilian \nNetwork for Global Climate Change (Rede \nCLIMA). The full historic context of these large \nresearch programs and their first results are found in \ntheir activity report (INCT for Climate Change, \n2010). A brief overview is given by Garcia &amp; Nobre \nin the foreword of this volume. Formed by nearly 50 \nscientists, the multidisciplinary and interinstitucional \nCZ network aims to evaluate the current state of \nknowledge, identify deficiencies, establish protocols, \nintegrate/coordinated projects and design scientific \nquestions in several GCC-related research topics. \nThe goals of the project are to investigate the \nimpacts of climate change on the Brazilian coast and \nto determine the coast\u2019s vulnerability to these \nchanges. The CZ project also seeks to propose \nmitigation and adaptation measures to compensate \nfor and to buffer the impacts of climate change. \n\nTo achieve these goals, the CZ project \norganised the \u201cFirst Brazilian Workshop on Climate \nChange and Coastal Zones\u201d, which was hosted by \nthe Federal University of Rio Grande (FURG) \n(Figure 1). The workshop brought together experts \nfrom fourteen national institutions and took \nimportant steps that facilitated the attainment of the \nfirst project goals. In this three-day workshop, \nexperts evaluated the status of the current knowledge \nof Brazilian coastal systems and processes and \n\n\n\nClimate Change and Brazilian Coastal Zone \n\nPan-American Pan-American Journal of Aquatic Sciences (2010), 5(2): I-VIII \n\nIII\n\npresented their preliminary results. In addition, \nparticipants offered recommendations for future \nstudies. The information gathered in the workshop \nresulted in fifteen scientific articles that comprise \nthis Special Issue of the Pan-American Journal of \nAquatic Sciences. In this editorial paper, we provide \nan overview and we also highlight the main findings \nof these articles, placing their importance and \nrelevance in the perspective of Brazilian coastal \nzones facing climate change. \n\n \nOverview of the volume content \n\nThe Brazilian coastline is almost 9,000 km \nlong and includes a variety of coastal features such \nas sedimentary cliffs, large and deeply incised \nestuaries, crystalline headlands and low-lying \ncoastal plains. By conducting a broad introductory \nreview on the morphology and vulnerability of the \nBrazilian coastal zone, Muehe explores how each \ncoastal region will respond in different ways to the \nexpected climate changes and associated sea-level \nrise. The author concludes that erosion, although \nirregularly distributed, is affecting the entire \nshoreline. The risk of erosion can be magnified by \nsea-level rise and by the increase in the frequency \nand intensity of storms. The southern Brazilian \ncoastline, for example, is exposed very often to \nextreme events, i.e., storm surges and storm waves, \nmostly associated with extra-tropical cyclones. The \nfrequency and intensity of these extreme events and \ntheir effects on erosion over the past 30 years is \nanalysed by Machado et al., who report a total of 40 \nextreme events associated with maximum erosion \nand surge elevation in Rio Grande do Sul State. If \nthe predicted sea-level rise occurs, the rise will \ncertainly increase the importance of the already-\nexisting storm surge hazards by intensifying \ninundation and the resulting erosion. In another \ncontribution, Muehe et al. show that erosive trends \nare not evident for some coastal-plain areas in Rio \nde Janeiro State. However, the lack of sediment \nsources can make the system highly vulnerable to \nsea-level rise. The sandy dune system is highly \nvulnerable to changes in water balance. These \nchanges can affect the sparse foredune vegetation \ncover and have drastic consequences for sediment \ntransport and coastal morphology. The study has \nprofound implications for predicting the effects of \ntemperature increases and rainfall on the fragile \nmorpho-sedimentary balance in these coastal plains.  \n\nThe vulnerability of the Brazilian coastal \nzone to climate change and the hazards and risks \ninvolved are evaluate by Nicolodi &amp; Petermann, \nwho take into account the natural, social and \ntechnological characteristics of each coastal \n\ngeographic region. Based on broad-scale and \ndetailed information for each region, the authors \nindicate the main economic sectors likely to be \naffected and identify different levels of vulnerability. \nThe areas identified as high and very high \nvulnerable should be at the top of the priority list for \nclimate change policies and plans. One of the most \nvulnerable areas affected by sea-level rise is the \nRecife (Pernambuco State) metropolitan centre. This \nintensely populated area is highly exposed to coastal \nerosion and inundation and is the site of several land \nuse conflicts. Based on optimistic and pessimistic \nIPCC emission scenarios, Costa et al. conduct a \nvulnerability and impact assessment for the region. \nThey define coastal and estuarine flooding zones and \ndiscuss the natural, historical-cultural and economic \nresources at risk. Both studies provide guidance for \npreventive strategies to adapt to the effects of \nclimate change.  \n\nThe overall consensus seems to be that \ndifferent Brazilian coastal regions will certainly be \naffected and will respond in different ways to \nclimate changes. However, further predictions, \nparticularly concerning sea-level rise, are very \nlimited. Lemos &amp; Ghisolfi show that most of the \ntide-gauge measurements performed along the coast \nare not accurate. This widespread inaccuracy thus \nplaces a serious limitation on attempts to clearly \ndefine the effects of global warming on the mean sea \nlevel along the Brazilian coast. These authors \ninvestigate the causes for this lack of accuracy and \nreport that methodological, technological and \ninstitutional problems need to be addressed to \nprovide better estimates of the sea level. \n\nBrazil is home to the third-largest mangrove \narea in the world (Giri et al. 2011). Brazilian \nartisanal fishers are highly dependent on these \nmangrove systems, which occupy 80% of the \ncoastline and have been threatened by several \nanthropogenic impacts. Faraco et al. propose an \ninnovative methodology to assess the vulnerability \nof mangrove system to climate change, adapted to \nBrazilian reality. The proposal includes not only sea-\nlevel rise estimates but also resilience and adaptation \ncapacity of the communities and the impacts of \nBrazilian conservation policies. The integrated \nsocio-ecological diagnosis and approach may lead to \na challenge in the development of management \npractices and more flexible policies, which are made \nwith the stakeholder\u00b4s participation, including \nmitigation and adaptation strategies. \n\nAlso important for conservation, fishing and \ntourism, Brazilian coral reefs are exposed to several \nkinds of natural and anthropogenic impacts. Corals \nhave been degraded worldwide by eutrophication, \n\n\n\nM. S. COPERTINO ET ALLI \n\nPan-American Journal of Aquatic Sciences (2010), 5(2): I-VIII \n\nIV \n\npollution and overfishing (Hughes et al. 2007). They \nare also seriously threaten by climate changes \nimpacts such as ocean acidification and warming \nthat are leading to decreased growth rates and \nincreasing bleaching and diseases (Anthony et al. \n2008, De\u00b4ath et al. 2009, Wild 2011). The status of \nthe coral reefs of Brazil is reviewed by Le\u00e3o et al., \nwho identify the reefs that are more stressed by \nanthropogenic impacts and more vulnerable to \nclimate change effects. The review provides an \nimportant basis for establishing priorities for future \nresearch and conservation plans for these unique \nBrazilian marine systems, which are marked by a \nresistant relict coral fauna and a high level of \nendemism. \n\nThe study of modes of large-scale climate \nvariability in relation to regional climate and \noceanographic parameters can reveal trends that are \nfundamental to GCC studies. Focusing on the \nresponses of large marine ecosystems (LMEs), \nGherardi et al. explore spatial patterns of correlation \nbetween several climate indices (Pacific Decadal \nOscillation, ENSO, North and South Atlantic and \nAntarctic Oscillation Index) and sea surface \ntemperature anomalies (SSTA) for the Southwest \nAtlantic. Their findings reveal distinct correlation \npatterns for the Brazilian LMEs. The authors point \nout that the response of LMEs to climatic variability \nmay not be controlled by the ecological criteria used \nto define the LMEs. The characteristics of the \ndependence on the SSTA of productivity and trophic \nrelations in each of the Brazilian LMEs are such that \nmixed responses are likely to be produced at the \necosystem level. Therefore, despite the great \nimportance of this framework for marine resource \nassessment and management, the use of LME \nresponses for monitoring GCC impacts requires \ngreat caution. \n\nChanges in global primary production have \nbeen showed by several studies over the past \ndecades, in association with multi-decadal climate \nand ocean variability (Chavez et al. 2011). Climate \ndriven changes in ocean temperature, nutrients and \nlight lead to changes in phytoplankton biomass and \nstructure, but the relative importance of the impacts \nand the biological responses are regionally varying \n(Marinov et al. 2010). The lack of long-term \nbiological observations makes it difficult to detect \nrobust changes with time at regional scales. Ciotti et \nal. used satellite data to conduct a first comparative \nevaluation of surface chlorophyll over the entire \nBrazilian continental shelf (BCS), characterising \neach region. The authors conclude that the detection \nof long-term trends is currently still not feasible for \nthe BCS. Despite the paucity of in situ \n\nmeasurements and the optical complexity associated \nwith Brazilian coastal waters, remote sensing of \nocean color is undoubtedly the best available tool for \na global description of chlorophyll and to predict the \neffects of GCC on marine primary production. The \nuse of these techniques in Brazilian science should \nbe enhanced. \n\nRainfall distribution and hydrological \nbalance are likely to be affected by GCC (Meehl et \nal. 2007). Lake and lagoon levels are among the \nmost apparent signals of change in water quantity. \nThe water catchment surface area is much greater \nthan the lake itself, and the water level can therefore \nvisibly reflect the influence of climate on a relatively \nlarge area (Williamson et al. 2009). By analysing 90 \nyears of water-level records for Mirim Lagoon \n(Brazil-Uruguay frontier), Hirata et al. find long-\nterm changes strongly associated with ENSO and \nidentified two regime shifts, apparently related to the \ncold and warm phases of the Pacific Decadal \nOscillation during the previous century. The last \nwarm phase, between 1977 and 1998, significantly \naffected the water balance of a wide region in \nSouthern South America (Haylook et al. 2006, \nAgosta and Compagnucci 2008). Hirata and co-\nauthors work provides key insights for predicting the \npossible effects of trends in regime shifts and of \nclimate change on the water balance of the coastal \nlagoons and wetlands of southern Brazil. \n\nFisheries may be impacted by climate \nchanges in several ways. They may be affected by \nthe increasing temperature, changes in salinity and \nocean currents, and also through the changes in \nnursery habitats and ecosystem primary production. \nCombining IPCC emission scenarios with regional \nclimate models, climate and biological time series \ndata, and accounting for local anthropogenic \nalterations, Shroeder &amp; Castello evaluate the future \nimpacts of global warming on the fisheries of Patos \nLagoon. They predict that the main factor affecting \nfisheries in this region will be the acceleration of the \noutflow current at the mouth of the lagoon. This \nhydrological change will have important cones-\nquences for the population dynamics of valuable fish \nresources and may produce changes to the fishing \ncalendar. Exploring a series of cause-effect \nrelationship, the authors call attention for the fact \nthat climate changes impacts on the local fisheries \ncan be both negative and positive, depending on the \nfactor and on the considered species. \n\nGlobal warming is expect to affect the \ndistribution of marine communities and many \nevidences of species shifting and changing \nabundance are raising from literature (Hoegh-\nGuldberg 2010). Previous biological knowledge and \n\n\n\nClimate Change and Brazilian Coastal Zone \n\nPan-American Pan-American Journal of Aquatic Sciences (2010), 5(2): I-VIII \n\nV\n\na comparison of present and past data allow De \nFaveri et al. to find important changes in an \nintertidal macroalgal community in southern Brazil \n(Santa Catarina State). The results include the \nappearance of tropical and opportunist species not \npreviously described in this region, and the \ndisappearance of local common taxa that used to \noccur in the 70\u00b4s decade. Many marine population \nresponses to temperature increases are expected to \nbe pronounced or to be initially detected in \ntransitional warm-temperate regions, such as \nSouthern Brazilian region. On rock shores, however, \nclimate change may not lead to a simple poleward \nshift in the distribution of intertidal organisms but \nmay cause localized extinctions, due to the inability \nof species to move into suitable habitats (Hawkins et \nal. 2008).Therefore, monitoring marine populations, \nwith a focus on stenothermic species, can provide \nuseful indicators of climate change effects, \nparticularly where historical temperature data are not \navailable. \n\nThe contributions appearing in the present \nvolume deal mainly with climate variability and its \npotential impacts during the previous decades or the \npast century. In contrast, Medeanic &amp; Correa go \nfurther back through recent geological time. Based \non radiocarbon and palynomorphic data from cores, \nthese authors make a preliminary paleore-\nconstruction of climate, sea-level oscillation and \nenvironmental changes in the coastal plain of the \nsouthernmost state of Brazil during the Holocene \n(~10,000 B.P.). Their work highlights the potential \nof palynomorph proxies as a tool to predict future \nscenarios based on climatic change periodicity. \n\nThe crucial role of scientific communication \nand media coverage on the GCC issue is also \nconsidered in this volume. Hellebrandt &amp; \nHellebrandt review the coverage of GCC by the \nBrazilian media and identified critical points. \nAmong these points is the predominance of issues \nset by an international scientific and political \nagenda. The Brazilian media reproduces information \nprovided by international agencies and news sources \nconnected with this agenda, which overlooks both \nlocal reality and scientific expertise. Failure to \ncommunicate key messages about climate change, \nparticularly if the regional context is not considered, \ncan have negative implications for public awareness \nand for establishing climate change policies. \n\n \nFinal remarks \n\nIf the physics of climate change still \ninvolves many uncertainties, the impacts of climate \nchange on coastal and marine ecosystems are still \nvery much controversial, particularly in the case of \n\nanalysis at the regional level. It seems relatively less \ncomplicated to predict the effects of a changing \nparameter (e.g., rising temperature, acidification and \ndecreasing light) on isolated species from previous \nknowledge about their physiology, ecology and \nreproductive biology. However, many challenges \narise when predicting the responses at the \ncommunity and ecosystem level, in addition to the \ncomplexity added by synergistic effects (Walther et \nal. 2002, Williams et al. 2008, Russel et al. 2009, \nHoegh-Guldberg &amp; Bruno 2010). Therefore, the \nchallenge posed to the worldwide scientific \ncommunity working with GCC and its impacts is \nparamount and will demand the best of our talent \nand creativity.  \n\nThe papers presented in this Special Issue \nconstitute a first step towards the provision of \nguidance to managers and policymakers who must \naddress the impacts of GCC in the Brazilian coastal \nzone, particularly in relation to the Climate Change \nNational Plan. However, a series of scientific goals \nstill need to be achieved to evaluate the effects of \nclimate change on the Brazilian coastal zone. These \ngoals include the analysis and integration of \nhistorical data, the application of standardised \nprotocols, hypothesis testing, and continuous data \nacquisition programmes specifically designed to \nobserve the coastal environments.  \n\nFor most Brazilian coastal ecosystems and \nregions, temporal and large spatial data is scarce for \nboth biotic and abiotic parameters. Where available, \ninformation is isolated, punctual in space, with short \nand incomplete time series (if any). Most studies \nalso lack integrated or comparative protocol \nconsistency. Scientific evaluations and future \nplanning on the impacts of climate change along \nBrazilian coastal zone will achieve development if \nobservational systems are implemented and \nimproved to allow systematic monitoring programs \nof physical, chemical, biological and social \nparameters. Experimental approaches can help \nclimate change science and management, but only \nafter a better determination of questions and \nhypothesis, that are specific to each regional \ncondition. \n\nBy researching GCC, science and scientists \ncannot be apart from society. Public awareness and \neducation may affect, at middle and long term, \nsociety opinion, behaviour and political decisions, \ncontributing for the advance of climate change \npolicies and actions. The Rio Grande Declaration, \nan open letter released soon after the Workshop and \nnow officially published in this volume, constitutes a \npreliminary attempt of CZ members and meeting \nparticipants to contribute to awareness and influence \n\n\n\nM. S. COPERTINO ET ALLI \n\nPan-American Journal of Aquatic Sciences (2010), 5(2): I-VIII \n\nVI \n\npublic policies. The letter warns about climate \nchange problems, particularly the ones affecting the \ncoast, and claims for society and political action. \n\nBy indicating deficiencies and revealing \nscientific hurdles, and pointing out the consequences \nfor ecosystems and society, the present volume is \nexpected to offer new insights and stimulate future \n\nstudies of impacts, mitigation measures and \nadaptation strategies for Brazilian coastal zones \nfacing Global Climate Change. It is also envisaged \nthat this initial step will foster new knowledge that \nwill represent a significant Brazilian contribution to \ninternational scientific forums addressing this \nimportant issue. \n\n \nAcknowledgments \n\nWe would like to acknowledge to the \nFederal University of Rio Grande and the Institute  \nof Oceanography, for all support given to the \nCoastal Zone project and by hosting the Workshop; \nto G.
