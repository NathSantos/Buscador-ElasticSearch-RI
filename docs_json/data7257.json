baga\u00e7o para produ\u00e7\u00e3o do etanol de segunda \n\ngera\u00e7\u00e3o \n \n\nMudan\u00e7a clim\u00e1tica global e a volatilidade do pre\u00e7o do petr\u00f3leo tem impulsionado a \nnecessidade de redu\u00e7\u00e3o e substitui\u00e7\u00e3o de combust\u00edveis f\u00f3sseis por energias renov\u00e1veis. A \nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o de bioetanol nos Estados Unidos e no Brasil a partir de milho e cana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar, \nrespectivamente, est\u00e1 estabelecida. Todavia, a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de bioetanol mostra-se insustent\u00e1vel, \npelo fato da utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de produtos alimentares para tal produ\u00e7\u00e3o. Em contrapartida, \nbiocombust\u00edveis produzidos a partir de res\u00edduos lignocelul\u00f3sicos t\u00eam sido vistos como uma \nsolu\u00e7\u00e3o plaus\u00edvel para o problema \u201calimento versus combust\u00edvel\u201d. No Brasil, o baga\u00e7o de \ncana \u00e9 uma fonte dispon\u00edvel de biomassa lignocelul\u00f3sica. No entanto, inibidores como \nfurfural, 5-hidroximetil-furfural (HMF) e \u00e1cidos carbox\u00edlicos formados durante o pr\u00e9-\ntratamento \u00e1cido da biomassa lignocelul\u00f3sica, t\u00eam efeito negativo sobre os microorganismos \nfermentadores - Saccharomyces cerevisiae. No Brasil, o etanol de segunda-gera\u00e7\u00e3o (2G) tem \npossibilidade de utilizar um novo substrato, preparado a partir da mistura de mela\u00e7o e \nhidrolisado de baga\u00e7o. O mela\u00e7o ser\u00e1 um adjuvante para suprir a defici\u00eancia nutricional do \nhidrolisado, contribuindo com minerais, amino\u00e1cidos e vitaminas. Por outro lado, o mela\u00e7o \napresenta alguns inibidores, como HMF, sulfito, e concentra\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00f3xica de alguns minerais, \ncomo pot\u00e1ssio (K) e c\u00e1lcio (Ca), que afetam o crescimento e desempenho fermentativo de S. \ncerevisiae. O objetivo deste trabalho foi gerar descendentes tolerantes de linhagens industriais \nde S. cerevisiae, capazes de lidar com inibidores presentes no mela\u00e7o e no hidrolisado de \nbaga\u00e7o, por meio de hibrida\u00e7\u00e3o e evolu\u00e7\u00e3o adaptativa, para produ\u00e7\u00e3o do etanol 2G. As \nlinhagens industriais PE-2, CAT-1 e SA-1 foram esporuladas, seus hapl\u00f3ides foram irradiados \npor luz ultravioleta (UV), objetivando o aumento da diversidade gen\u00e9tica e fenot\u00edpica das \nlinhagens. Ap\u00f3s cruzamento direcionado, 234 h\u00edbridos foram selecionados pelo crescimento \n(DO570nm) em meios de mela\u00e7o e hidrolisado. Em paralelo, cruzamentos massais (intra e inter-\nlinhagens) de hapl\u00f3ides n\u00e3o-irradiados de PE-2, CAT-1 e SA-1 foram realizados e \nsubmetidos a evolu\u00e7\u00e3o adaptativa por cerca de 100 gera\u00e7\u00f5es. As 120 estirpes de cruzamentos \nmassais seguidos de evolu\u00e7\u00e3o adaptativa foram selecionadas pelo crescimento em meios de \nmela\u00e7o e hidrolisado. Seis isolados apresentaram boas caracter\u00edsticas fermentativas em \ncompara\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s cepas refer\u00eancias, mostrando que hibrida\u00e7\u00e3o e evolu\u00e7\u00e3o adaptativa de \nlinhagens de leveduras industriais brasileiras s\u00e3o boas estrat\u00e9gias para desenvolver novas \nlinhagens para produ\u00e7\u00e3o do etanol-2G. Para uma melhor utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o dos a\u00e7\u00facares do \nhidrolisado, a cassete contendo os tr\u00eas genes respons\u00e1veis pela fermenta\u00e7\u00e3o de xilose (xilose \nredutase, xilitol desidrogenase e xiluloquinase) foi integrada no genoma do hapl\u00f3ide \nsegregante (272-1a) de uma das seis estirpes selecionadas (272), que apresentou a maior \ntoler\u00e2ncia em hidrolisado de Miscanthus x giganteus. Estudos de fermenta\u00e7\u00e3o mostraram que \na estirpe foi capaz de metabolizar a xilose em etanol. Por fim, o haploide 272-1a foi analisado \npor quantitative trait loci (QTL) afim de identificar a base gen\u00e9tica da toler\u00e2ncia ao \nhidrolisado. Apesar, do(s) gene(s) causativos n\u00e3o terem sido identificados nesse trabalho, os \npicos do mapa de QTL identificados servir\u00e3o como ponto de partida para futuro mapeamento.  \n\n \nPalavras-chave: Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Etanol de segunda-gera\u00e7\u00e3o; Cruzamentos; \n\nEvolu\u00e7\u00e3o adaptativa; Hidrolisado lignocelul\u00f3sico; Toler\u00e2ncia; Inibidores \n \n!  \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n12!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n13!\n\nABSTRACT \n\n \nImprovement of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by hybridization for increased tolerance \n\ntowards inhibitors from second-generation ethanol substrate \n \n\nGlobal climate change and volatility of petroleum price have driven the necessity to \nreduce fossil fuel utilization and replace it by renewable energy. Bioethanol production in the \nUnited States and Brazil from cornstarch and sugarcane, respectively, is already established. \nHowever, the bioethanol industry appears unsustainable in view of the potential stress that its \nproduction places on food commodities. In contrast, second-generation biofuels produced \nfrom cheap and abundant lignocellulosic biomass, has been viewed as one plausible solution \nto this \"food versus fuel\" problem. Sugarcane bagasse is an abundant source of lignocellulosic \nbiomass in Brazil and is generally recognized as a very promising feedstock for \nlignocellulosic ethanol production. Nevertheless, inhibitors such as furfural, 5-hydroxymethyl \nfurfural (HMF) and carboxylic acids are formed during an acid thermochemical pretreatment \nof lignocellulosic biomass, which has a negative effect on the fermentative microorganisms \u2013 \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae. Second-generation (2G) ethanol in Brazil has the possibility to use \na novel substrate, prepared as a blend of sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate and cane molasses. \nMolasses supplements the nutritional deficiencies of bagasse hydrolysate, contributing with \nminerals, amino acids and vitamins. However, molasses also contains additional inhibitors, \nsuch as HMF, sulfite, and toxic concentration of some minerals (K, Ca), which affect S. \ncerevisiae fermentation performance. The goal of this work was to generate tolerant \nderivatives of S. cerevisiae industrial strains that are able to cope with inhibitors present in \nbagasse hydrolysate and molasses, by means of sexual hybridization and adaptive evolution, \nwhich can be used for 2G-ethanol production. The industrial strains PE-2, CAT-1 and SA-1 \nwere sporulated, and haploids were irradiated by ultraviolet (UV) light in order to increase \ngenetic and phenotypic diversity. After direct mating and screening in molasses and \nhydrolysate media, 234 hybrid strains were selected for further study.  In parallel, mass \nmatings (intra and interlines) of PE-2, CAT-1 and SA-1 from non-irradiated haploids were \nperformed and the generated strains were subjected to adaptive evolution for about 100 \ngenerations. The 120 strains derived from mass mating and adaptive evolution were then \nscreened for growth in molasses-hydrolysate media. Six isolates showed good fermentation \nproperties compared to the reference strains, showing that hybridization and adaptive \nevolution of Brazilian industrial yeast strains was a good strategy to develop new tolerant \nstrains for 2G-ethanol production.  To better utilize all the sugars present in bagasse \nhydrolysate, a cassette containing the three genes responsible for xylose fermentation (xylose \nreductase, xylitol dehydrogenase and xylulose kinase) was integrated into the genome of a \nhaploid derivative (272-1a) of one of the six selected hybrids (272), which had the highest \ntolerance to Miscanthus x giganteus hydrolysate.  Fermentation studies demonstrated that this \nengineered strain was able to metabolize xylose into ethanol. Finally, the haploid 272-1a was \nanalyzed by quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping to identify the genetic basis of hydrolysate \ntolerance.  Although the causative gene(s) were not identified in this work, a number of QTL \npeaks were identified that will serve as the starting point for future fine-mapping studies. \n\n \nKeywords: Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Second-generation ethanol; Breeding; Adaptive \n\nevolution; Lignocellulosic hydrolysate; Inhibitors; Tolerance \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n14!\n\n \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n15!\n\n1 INTRODUCTION!\n \n \n\nGlobal climate change and volatility of petroleum prices have driven the necessity to \n\nreduce the fossil fuel consumption and replace it with renewable energy source. Bioethanol \n\nproduction in the United States and Brazil, from corn and sugarcane respectively, is already \n\nestablished; however these renewable energy sources have some ethical limitations, because \n\nfood-products are being used to produce biofuel (BELLISSIMI et al., 2009; WRIGHT et al., \n\n2011; KIM et al., 2013a). Additionally in Brazil, deforestation of new areas to expand the \n\nagricultural area is unsustainable. Non-food renewable feedstocks, such as lignocellulosic \n\nbiomass (i.e. sugarcane bagasse) are an effective alternative to boost bioethanol production in \n\nBrazil by up to 30%, while preserving native areas (G20, 2014; GLOBO RURAL, 2014).  \n\nLignocellulosic biomass is mainly composed of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in \n\nan organized structure; however, a pretreatment is required to hydrolyze the hemicellulose \n\nand make the cellulose accessible to enzymatic hydrolysis. Although the commonly used \n\nmethod of acid thermochemical pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass releases pentose and \n\nhexose sugars (HA et al., 2011), the harsh reaction conditions also results in the formation of \n\ninhibitors (e.g. furfural, 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) and carboxylic acids) that have a \n\nnegative effect on the growth and fermentation of ethanol producing microorganisms, such as \n\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae (JONSSON et al., 2013; SATO et al., 2014). \n\n Second-generation ethanol in Brazil has the possibility to use a blend of sugarcane \n\nbagasse hydrolysate and cane molasses (co-product from the sugar industry). Molasses \n\nprovides nutrients and minerals that are missing or deficient from hydrolysate, such as amino \n\nacids, B group vitamins (HARRISON, 1971), organic acids (trans-aconitc, citric, malic, \n\nwhich contribute a desirable buffer effect), fatty acids (linoleic, palmitic, oleic and linolenic) \n\n(GUTIERREZ; SILVA, 1993) and minerals (K, Mg, S, Ca, P, Zn, Cu, Mn, Al) (MORRISON, \n\n1959). These organic and mineral nutrients are crucial for maintaining S. cerevisiae cell \n\nviability during cell recycling that is practiced in Brazilian distilleries. Molasses also \n\ncontributes to an increased sugar concentration that results in higher ethanol titers, and \n\nconsequently lower energy consumption in the distillation step. However, molasses also has \n\ninhibitors, such as HMF, sulfite, and toxic concentration of some minerals (K, Ca) that affect \n\nS. cerevisiae fermentation performance (BASSO et al., 2008). \n\nFirst-generation ethanol production in Brazil uses a mixture of sugar cane juice and \n\nmolasses in different proportions in fed-batch fermentations with cell recycling. The high cell \n\ndensity ensures a very short fermentation time. This process requires yeast cells with high \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n16!\n\nviability in order to sustain a large biomass inside the fermenter (BASSO et al., 2008). It is \n\nexpected that second-generation lignocellulosic ethanol production will apply the same fed-\n\nbatch process using hydrolysate, and similarly, yeasts with high viability will be required to \n\nwithstand the rigors of cell recycling. In addition, yeast strains for second-generation ethanol \n\nproduction in Brazil need to be tolerant to the cocktail of inhibitors present both in \n\nhydrolysate and molasses, and robust to the stresses encountered during the industrial process \n\n(i.e. high temperature, high ethanol content, acid treatment, osmotic pressure, cell recycling).  \n\nHowever industrial yeast strains, used for first-generation (1G) ethanol, have been \n\nshowing decreased implantation capacity due to the higher proportion of molasses in the \n\ncurrent industrial substrate (BASSO et al., 2008); a new generation of more tolerant yeast \n\nstrains are required for both first and specially second-generation (2G) ethanol production. \n\nOne viable approach to developing these new yeast strains is sexual hybridization and mass \n\nmating of current 1G strains.  This is possible because current (1G) industrial strains are \n\ncommercially available, they sporulate easily and generate viable spores, and they have \n\nalready been selected for tolerance to industrial fermentation conditions (ALEXANDRINO, \n\n2012). In addition, to mating and sporulation, genotypic and phenotypic diversity can be \n\nfurther increased by induced mutation by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and adaptive laboratory \n\nevolution.   \n\nIn addition, it is essential for economic conversion of renewable feedstock into \n\nbiofuels and chemicals, an efficient and rapid fermentation of mixed sugars, ~70% of hexoses \n\nand ~30% of pentoses present in lignocellulosic biomass (HA et al., 2011). However wild \n\ntype S. cerevisiae used for first-generation (1G) ethanol cannot ferment pentose (xylose). \n\nThe goal of this work was to generate new tolerant derivatives of 1G Saccharomyces \n\ncerevisiae industrial strains that are able to cope with inhibitors present in a mixture of cane \n\nbagasse hydrolysate and molasses, using sexual hybridization, UV mutagenesis, and adaptive \n\nevolution. Such tolerant strains would be valuable backgrounds for further metabolic \n\nengineering to enable xylose fermentation. The second goal was to understand the genetic \n\nbasis of hydrolysate tolerance by quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. In the long-term, \n\nidentification of hydrolysate tolerance genes and their mechanism(s) of action should enable \n\nfuture engineering efforts to generate optimal strains that are necessary for an economic \n\nlignocellulosic ethanol process. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n17!\n\n2 REVIEW \n\n \n\n2.1 Second-generation ethanol in Brazil \n\n \n\n Global concerns about climate change and international oil prices have increased the \n\nadoption of renewable energy policies. Biofuels (i.e. bioethanol and biodiesel) can contribute \n\nto minimizing fossil fuel consumption. Bioethanol production is obtained from sugarcane \n\nsubstrates (cane juice and molasses) and cornstarch fermentation by Saccharomyces \n\ncerevisiae, in Brazil and the United States, respectively. Currently, Brazil is the world\u2019s \n\nsecond biggest ethanol producer (RENEWABLE FUELS ASSOCIATION - RFA, 2014) and \n\nproduction is expected to reach 27 billion liters of ethanol in the 2014/2015 season \n\n(COMPANHIA NACIONAL DE ABASTECIMENTO - CONAB, 2014). However, the first-\n\ngeneration (1G) ethanol industry in Brazil and the United States appears unsustainable in \n\nview of the potential stress its production places on food commodities. In contrast, second-\n\ngeneration (2G) biofuels produced from cheap and abundant non-food plant feedstocks, has \n\nbeen viewed as one plausible solution to this \u201cfood versus fuel\u201d problem (GOMEZ et al., \n\n2008; BASSO et al., 2013). \n\nIn Brazil, sugarcane bagasse and sugarcane straw are available sources of \n\nlignocellulosic biomass and are considered a very promising feedstock for 2G-ethanol \n\nproduction. Although burning bagasse/straw at ethanol distilleries for generation of electricity \n\nis current profitable, the development of 2G-bioethanol will be more advantageous (DIAS et \n\nal., 2011). Additionally, the high cost of 2G-bioethanol production, irrespective of the \n\nlignocellulosic feedstock used, can be partially solved by integrating the 1G and 2G \n\ntechnologies into a plant thus sharing energy and material streams in unit operations in order \n\nto exploit synergies (MACRELLI et al., 2012). \n\nFirst-generation bioethanol production in Brazil uses a mixture of cane juice and \n\nmolasses (co-products from the sugar industry) in different proportions, in either a fed-batch \n\nor continuous fermentation process with cell recycling. Fed-batch process, or Melle-Boinot \n\nutilizes a high cell concentration in order to reduce fermentation time and biomass growth \n\nduring cell recycling. Even so, some yeast growth is required at least to replace biomass \n\n(above 5-10%) that is lost during centrifugation in each fermentation cycle. The industrial \n\nprocess starts with the addition of must (a mixture of sugarcane juice and molasses) \n\ncontaining a total reducing sugar (TRS) concentration of 18-22% to the yeast cell suspension. \n\nAfter 6-10 hours of fermentation at 32-38oC, the final ethanol titer is about 8 to 10% (v/v). At \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n18!\n\nthe end of this fermentation, the yeast is separated from the fermented must by centrifugation \n\nand diluted to 30-40% (w/v) with water, and then submitted to an acid treatment (sulfuric \n\nacid, pH 1.8 to 2.5 for 1-2 hours) to reduce the bacterial contamination. After the acid wash \n\nthe yeast is ready for the next fermentative cycle. The yeast cells can be submitted to two \n\ndaily cycles during the annual sugarcane harvest season (200-250 days). Yeast cells must be \n\ntolerant to the stresses encountered during fermentation, such as high ethanol content, high \n\ntemperature, osmotic pressure and cell recycling (BASSO et al., 2008). It is expected that 2G-\n\nbioethanol production will utilize a similar industrial process and yeast cells will encounter \n\nstress condition present for 1G ethanol and 2G ethanol, such as organic acids and HMF. In \n\naddition, the yeast will need to be propagated during fermentations cycles to replace biomass \n\nthat is lost during the centrifugation and acid-wash step. \n\n In Brazil, a selection program was performed for 12 years hoping to select optimal \n\nyeast strains that are ideally suited for industrial ethanol production. Some of the desired traits \n\nare high ethanol yield, reduced glycerol and foam formation, maintenance of high viability \n\nduring recycling, and long-term prevalence and persistence in the bioreactor. As a result of \n\nthis selection program, a number of S. cerevisiae strains, such as BG-1, CAT-1, PE-2 and SA-\n\n1 were identified, and became widely used in distilleries for many decades. Therefore, such \n\nstrains were not suitable for 2G-ethanol production, but could be of great importance as \n\nbiological material for a breeding program, generating better strains (BASSO et al., 2008).  \n\nMineral and organic nutrients are required for high cell viability maintenance, a \n\ncrucial trait for a cell recycling process. Nevertheless the bagasse hydrolysate is devoid of \n\nsuch nutrients showing instead some yeast inhibitors formed and released during pretreatment \n\n(i.e. furfural, HMF, acetic acid). As an alternative, molasses can be blended with hydrolysate. \n\nMolasses will contribute with minerals (K, Mg, S, Ca, P, Zn, Cu, Mn, Al) (MORRISON, \n\n1959) and organic nutrients, such as amino acids, B group vitamins (HARRISON, 1971), \n\norganic acids (trans-aconitc, citric, malic, all contributing for a buffer effect) and fatty acids \n\n(linoleic, palmitic, oleic and linolenic) (GUTIERREZ; SILVA, 1993). Molasses also \n\ncontributes for increased sugar concentration allowing a higher ethanol titer, and \n\nconsequently lower energy consumption in the distillation step. On the other hand, molasses \n\nhas some inhibitors compounds as HMF, sulfite, and toxic concentration of some minerals (K, \n\nCa) affecting S. cerevisiae performance. All of the above considerations point to the need for \n\nnew strains able to cope with inhibitors from both molasses and bagasse hydrolysate.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n19!\n\n2.2 Genotypic and phenotypic diversity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains \n\n \n\nCurrently, industrial strains represent only the tip of the \u201ciceberg\u201d of the genetic and \n\nphenotypic diversity present in natural S. cerevisiae isolates. Although it is possible to isolate \n\nadditional strains as a source of genetic diversity, which could be used for breeding and \n\nselection, an alternative approach is to generate diversity artificially. A number of methods, \n\nsuch as mutagenesis, genome shuffling, adaptive evolution, and direct genetic modification \n\ncould be used to develop 2G-ethanol production strains. These techniques can be used to \n\nselect for specific traits and might lead to the generation of optimal strains more rapidly than \n\ntraditional breeding and selection (STEENSELS et al., 2014). Many industrial strains often \n\nshow aneuploidy, polyploidy, poor sporulation efficiency, and unstable mating type \n\n(homothallic); together, this makes it difficult to apply artificial diversity techniques \n\n(GIUDICI et al., 2005). In contrast, Brazilian industrial strains isolates from 1G-ethanol \n\nprocess are heterothallic (have stable mating types), diploid, and sporulate easily giving \n\nviable spores; together, these traits facilitate their genetic manipulation (ARGUESO et al., \n\n2009; ALEXANDRINO, 2012). \n\nSeveral different processes can generate genetic variation. Such processes include \n\nsexual reproduction, where the genomes of two parents are combined and shuffled by \n\nrecombination. S. cerevisiae can undergo sexual reproduction and this can lead to the \n\ngeneration of new strains. In addition, S. cerevisiae can grow asexually, and spontaneous \n\nmutations can accumulate during mitotic growth (STEENSELS et al., 2014). \n\nCombining desirable characteristics by breeding and selection is a standard approach \n\nto improve the properties of sexual reproduction organisms (DARWIN, 1859 apud GIUDICI \n\net al., 2005). Hybrids derived from different yeast strains may have better fitness and \n\nperformance than either parental strain (i.e. heterosis). Hybridization of heterothallic yeast \n\nstrains directly by micromanipulation or mixing of sporulated cultures was the first publish \n\nmethod of yeast strain improvement (WINGE &amp; LAUSTEN, 1938; GIUDICI et al., 2005). \n\nSexual hybridization (or reproduction) increases the evolutionary potential of a species \n\n(BUCKLING et al., 2009). Direct mating, mass mating or genome shuffling can be used to \n\nachieve hybridization in S. cerevisiae.  \n\nDirect mating and selection of S. cerevisiae is a powerful approach to generate new \n\nstrains, similar to selective breeding in agriculture. It consists of crossing two selected \n\nparents, each with desired phenotypes. If both parental strains are heterothallic, a prescreening \n\nof the stable vegetative haploid segregants of both parents can be carried out and the best \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n20!\n\nhaploid segregant can be selected for hybridization (LINDEGREN; LINDEGREN, 1943). \n\nThis technique is called \u201ccell-to-cell\u201d and consists of simply mixing cell cultures of the two \n\nselected haploids. In homothallic strain, no stable haploid segregants can be obtained, and the \n\nadditional prescreening is not feasible (SIPICZKI, 2008).  \n\nAlthough time-consuming, direct mating has proven to be an effective way to obtain \n\nhybrids that display desired phenotypes (SIPICZKI, 2008). For example, a hybrid of a haploid \n\nsegregant of the Ethanol Red strain and an engineered inhibitor tolerant strain was used to \n\ndevelop an improved for fermentation of a mixture of glucose and xylose. This strain had a \n\nnumber of desirable traits, including faster growth rate in glucose medium, faster glucose \n\nconsumption rate and higher ethanol accumulation capacity in very high gravity fermentation; \n\nalso, it was able to metabolize a mixture of glucose and xylose (DEMEKE et al., 2013). \n\nHybrids obtained by direct mating of flocculent strains of S. cerevisiae and cold-fermentation \n\nstrains of S. uvarum, showed interesting characteristics for sparkling wines, such as less \n\nformation of fermentation products (i.e. glycerol, succinic acid, acetic acid, and malic acid) \n\nthan the parental strains; fermentation at low temperatures and production of a wine that is \n\nhighly aromatic (COLORETTI et al., 2006). Sipiczki (2008) had reported several works from \n\ndifferent authors of interspecies hybrids obtained by direct mating of S. cerevisiae and S. \n\nuvarum wine strains, S. kudriavzevii and S. paradoxus. \n\nMass mating is a technique in which a large number of haploid yeast cells, often from \n\ndifferent parental strains are mixed and allowed to cross randomly. Mass mating has been \n\nused to generate industrial strains with improved characteristics (STEENSELS et al., 2014). \n\nMass mating was used to create interspecific hybrids between different wine strains by \n\ncrossing a top-fermenting S. cerevisiae strain with a cryophilic S. bayanus strain. The desired \n\nhybrid strain was then selected based on the combination of traits inherited from each parent, \n\nsuch as the ability to assimilate melibiose and growth at low temperature (20oC). The result of \n\nthis interspecies hybridization was a new strain that exhibited both good low temperature \n\nfermentation and produce wine with new flavor characteristics (SATO et al., 2002). \n\nGenome shuffling is a technique related to mass mating that relies on repeated rounds \n\nof mating, sporulation, and selection to recombine desired traits from multiple parents into a \n\nsingle optimized strain (GONG et al., 2009; STEENSELS et al., 2014). Genome shuffling \n\nsimulates the natural evolution process: once a mutation that confers an improved phenotype \n\nhas arisen in the experimental population, the recombination tests it in association with all \n\nother beneficial traits already present, without all of these combinations having to be derived \n\nagain. Moreover, the genome shuffling permits an efficient removal of a deleterious mutation \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n21!\n\nby replacing them with the wild type sequences, avoiding the hampering of general fitness \n\n(GIUDICI et al., 2005). Genome shuffling has been successfully applied as an effective \n\nwhole-cell engineering approach for the rapid improvement of industrially important \n\nmicrobial phenotypes (GONG et al., 2009). Compared to other improvement techniques, \n\ngenome shuffling has the advantage of exploiting the full genetic diversity in a population and \n\nmakes it possible to combine useful mutations from many different individuals, while other \n\nhybridization methods, such as direct mating, typically involve only a limited number of \n\nhaploid cells. Additionally, while traditional methods of strain improvement often select only \n\nthe best-performing mutant for each subsequent round, genome shuffling exploits a much \n\nlarger proportion of the diversity present in the population (STEENSELS et al., 2014). In this \n\nway, both laboratory and industrial S. cerevisiae strains have been selected for desired \n\nphenotypes such as ethanol tolerance, thermotolerance, acetic acid tolerance, and \n\nfermentation performance using genome shuffling. Some recent studies, reported by Steensels \n\net al. (2014), combine metabolic engineering with genome shuffling (TAO et al., 2012; \n\nDEMEKE et al., 2013). These approaches are promising to optimize strains for second-\n\ngeneration bioethanol production (STEENSELS et al., 2014). \n\n \n\n2.3 Mutagenesis  \n\n \n\nMutagenesis is often the first step in generating genetic variation in a cell or \n\npopulation, followed by sexual hybridization (direct mating, mass mating or genome \n\nshuffling) of the best-performing mutants (STEENSELS et al., 2014). Mutagenesis is \n\ncommonly used to obtain interspecies hybrids for wine fermentation (GONZ\u00c1LES et al., \n\n2006; SIPICZKI, 2008), flocculent Saccharomyces strains for sparkling wines (COLORETTI; \n\nTINI, 2006), and for brewer\u2019s yeast with desired characteristics (SATO et al., 2002). \n\nWhile mutations are induced with the same frequency in haploid, diploid or polyploid \n\ncells, they are not as easily detected in diploid or polyploid as in haploid cells because of the \n\npresence of non-mutated alleles. Only if the mutation is dominant will it affect the phenotype. \n\nTherefore, haploid derivatives are preferred for the mutagenesis program (PRETORIUS, \n\n2000). Because the rate of spontaneous mutation is low, approximately 10-6 per generation \n\n(PRETORIUS, 2000), the use of induced mutagenesis techniques, such as chemical of UV \n\nlight is commonly used (GIUDICI et al., 2005). \n\nUltraviolet (UV) irradiation is a physical process that damages DNA and induces \n\nmutations (IKEHATA; ONO, 2011). Short wave (UVC, 100-290 nm) causes a high quantity \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n22!\n\nof pyrimidine dimers, hydroxylated bases, and cross-linking of DNA strands (ROWLANDS, \n\n1984). A combination of UV irradiation and genome shuffling is a powerful strategy for \n\nstrain improvement and had been used to improve thermotolerance, ethanol tolerance, and \n\nethanol productivity of S. cerevisiae (SHI et al., 2008). For example, pools of S. cerevisiae \n\nhaploid mutants were created by UV mutagenesis, then mated and subjected to five rounds of \n\ngenome shuffling in order to generate strains that are tolerant to inhibitors present in \n\nhardwood spent sulfite liquor (PINEL et al., 2011). In another example, subjecting a pool of \n\nUV-induced variants to consecutive rounds of fermentation in very high gravity wort was \n\nused to obtain improved industrial yeast strains for lager brewing (BLIECK et al., 2007). \n\n   \n\n2.4 Adaptive evolution \n\n \n\nCharles Darwin\u2019s theory for the evolution of new species by natural selection is a long \n\ntimescale process that can be observed in the fossil record. In the laboratory, microorganisms \n\nwith a short generation time can be evolved for hundreds or even thousands of generations; \n\ntherefore it is possible to generate new strains in a relatively short timespan. Adaptive \n\nevolution in the laboratory relies on genetic diversity and artificial selection, which is \n\nanalogous to processes that occur in nature during the evolution of new species (BUCKLING \n\net al., 2009) \n\nStrain improvement by evolutionary engineering, a term first described by Butler et al. \n\n(1996) and later referred to as adaptive, directed or experimental evolution, applies to the \n\nbasic principles of natural, induced or both genetic variation (random mutation) and \n\nsubsequent selection on this variation, allowing the organism to evolve the desired set of \n\nphenotypes. In sum, adaptive evolution, naturally selects a population adapted to a specific \n\nenvironment over time (NOVO et al., 2014).  \n\nAdaptive evolution can also be combined with the use of mutagenesis, sexual \n\nhybridization or both within the evolving population in order to increase the genotypic and \n\nphenotypic variability that the selection can act on. When a specific mutation with fitness \n\nadvantage occurs in a cell, this variant will be selected and enriched in the population \n\n(STEENSELS et al., 2014). Adaptive evolution is a feasible way to generate yeast strains \n\nwith improved phenotypes because this microorganism has a short generation time and easy \n\nmanipulation and cultivation in laboratory (ELENA; LENSKI, 2003; BUCKLING et al., \n\n2009; STEENSELS et al., 2014).  \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n23!\n\nAdaptive evolution has proven to be a valuable tool to create yeast strains with \n\nspecific improved characteristics (SAUER, 2001). Normally directed evolution is used to \n\nfine-tune a specific phenotype that is already present in the original population, but is not \n\noptimal yet (STEENSELS et al., 2014). Usually, adaptive evolution is performed for 100 to \n\n2000 generations and normally it takes a few weeks up to a few months of phenotypes \n\ncompetition for a dominance of suitable strain in the total population (DRAGOSITS; \n\nMATTANOVICH, 2013). Batch culture in shake flasks with serial transfers of cells to a new \n\nflask with fresh medium for an additional round of growth, or a continuous culture system \n\nsuch as a chemostat are different ways to setup an adaptive evolution experiment (Figure 1) \n\n(DRAGOSITS; MATTANOVICH, 2013; NOVO et al., 2014; STEENSELS et al., 2014). \n\n                                 a)            \n\n                                       b)  \n \nFigure 1 - Adaptive evolution experiment for microbial biotechnology: a) in batch culture shake flasks and b) \n\ncontinuous culture system - chemostat (DRAGOSITS; MATTANOVICH, 2013) \n \n\nEvolutionary engineering has successfully been used in a number of S. cerevisiae \n\nstrains improvement studies (STEENSELS et al., 2014). Demeke et al. (2103) used this \n\ntechnique to select for a strain with improved xylose fermentation and inhibitor tolerance. In \n\nanother example, long-term adaptive evolution (batch serial transfer for 450 generations) was \n\nused to select a S. cerevisiae wine strain with reduced ethanol content and increased glycerol \n\nlevels. The resulting strain produced a wine with improved body and sweetness, which are \n\ncharacteristics desired by the wine industry (TILLOY et al., 2014). Adaptive evolution in \n\nshake flasks over 300 generations (more than 90 days) was also used to generate a S. \n\ncerevisiae strain with increased thermotolerance (CASPETA et al., 2014). In other examples, \n\na home-made bioreactor was used to select an industrial yeast wine for enhanced growth \n\nunder ethanol stress after 225 generations (NOVO et al., 2014). Finally evolutionary \n\nengineering has been used to improve acetic acid tolerance (an inhibitor widely present in \n\nplant hydrolysates) and xylose fermentation (BELLISSIMI et al., 2009; WRIGHT et al., \n\n2011).  \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n24!\n\nAdaptive evolution was recently demonstrated by an elegant method called visualizing \n\nevolution in real-time (VERT) (REYES et al., 2012). During adaptive evolution, mutants with \n\nincreased performance (adaptive mutants) expand in the population. These adaptive events \n\nare identified by VERT, which uses differentially labeled fluorescent subpopulations and flow \n\ncytometry to monitor adaptive evolution in real-time (ALMARIO et al., 2013). \n\n \n\n2.5 Chromosomal rearrangements  \n\n \n\nChromosome rearrangements (CRs) may also represent a mechanism for evolution \n\nand adaptation of S. cerevisiae to environmental changes (LOPES, 2000). Variations that \n\nresult in a difference in the size of the chromosomal DNA molecules can be caused by \n\ntranslocations, deletions or other genomic rearrangements. In addition, CRs are a known \n\nmechanism of generating strain variability in several fungal species (ZOLAN, 1995 apud \n\nLOPES, 2000).  \n\nChromosomal rearrangements have been observed in S. cerevisiae strains grown in an \n\nindustrial fermenter. After an eight-month period of cell recycling, CRs were observed in the \n\nstrain PE-2 (BASSO et al., 2008). During a given season (200-250 days) in a Brazilian \n\ndistillery it is expected that an introduced starter strain will undergo anywhere from 60 to 70 \n\ngenerations of growth (considering a 10% (w/v) yeast growth for each fermentation cycle, \n\nand two fermentation cycles per day) if the strain is able to persist in the bioreactor. In \n\nlaboratory, CRs of a diploid wine strain were observed after 55 generations of mitotic growth. \n\nAfter 275 generations, about half of the population was represented by 11 different CRs \n\n(LONGO; V\u00c9ZINHET, 1993). Sporulation followed by germination and growth in rich \n\nmedium allowed PE-2 strain to exhibit the same CRs as found in the industrial setting, \n\nsuggesting that both mitotic growth and sporulation might have contributed to the different \n\nchromosomal karyotypes observed in various distilleries that used PE-2 as the starting strain \n\n(LOPES, 2000). The environmental conditions outside the fermentation tank could allow \n\nsporulation to occur and then new recombinant spores might settle again into the fermentation \n\nmixture and germinate, resulting in the production of new hybrids strains. \n\nIt has been suggested that the unique selective pressures of each industrial process \n\n(such as wining, baking, distilling, etc.) leads to the generation of strains specifically adapted \n\nto their environment (COD\u00d3N et al., 1998; INFANTE et al., 2003; SIPICZKI, 2011). In \n\nseveral occasions, CRs were correlated with improved yeast fitness to stressful process \n\nconditions, such as SO2 tolerance (ORT\u00cdN et al., 2002), glucose limitation (DUNHAM et al., \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n25!\n\n2002; COLSON et al., 2004), starvation (COYLE; KROLL, 2008), and Cu tolerance \n\n(CHANG et al., 2013). Most of the studies on yeast adaptation were performed with wine \n\nstrains or wine conditions and \u201cdue to its unique plasticity, the wine yeast genome can change \n\neasily both during vegetative propagation (mitotic divisions) and in the sexual cycle (meiosis-\n\nsporulation-conjugation). During fermentation, the genomes of certain vegetatively \n\npropagating yeast cells undergo multiple, successive mutations and gross genomic \n\nrearrangements, resulting in a variety of clones with different genomes, some of them with \n\nbeneficial changes that have become fixed in the evolution of certain populations\u201d \n\n(SIPICZKI, 2011). \n\nSimilar to wine strains, adaptive evolution mediated by CRs has been observed in fuel \n\nethanol strains (BASSO et al., 2008). In both cases, the specific advantage(s) conferred by \n\nthese CRs is not understood. \n\n \n\n2.6 Engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae for xylose fermentation \n\n \n\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae, which is currently being used to produce ethanol, does not \n\nnatively assimilate xylose (HAHN-HAGERDAL et al., 2006 apud KIM et al., 2013a). \n\nCurrently two xylose-assimilation pathways have been used to engineer S. cerevisiae for \n\nxylose fermentation: xylose isomerase (XI) pathway (found in both bacteria and fungi), and \n\nthe xylose reductase (XR) and xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH) pathway (genes from \n\nSchefferomyces stipitis). Both pathways require overexpression of xylulose kinase (XK), \n\nwhich connects xylulose to the endogenous pentose phosphate pathway of S. cerevisiae \n\n(Figure 2). Although the XR/XDH pathway has two intrinsic defects, including xylitol \n\nsecretion and unbalanced cofactor requirements during anaerobic fermentation, its \n\nthermodynamic advantage compared to XI pathway results in faster xylose assimilation and \n\ngreater ethanol production (KARHUMAA et al., 2007; KIM et al., 2013a). The XI pathway is \n\nof interest because it can be used for anaerobic xylose fermentation (KUYPER et al., 2005). \n\nA number of studies have been performed to optimize the XR/XDH pathway (KOTTER et \n\nal., 1990; TANTIRUNGKIL et al., 1993; WALFRIDSSON et al., 1995; HO et al., 1998; \n\nTOIVARI et al., 2001). In one recent example, a combination of rational and evolutionary \n\nengineering was used to optimize xylose fermentation. In their work, expression levels of \n\nxylose reductase (XYL1), xylitol dehydrogenase (XYL2) and xylulokinase (XYL3) had to be \n\nincreased, in addition to deletion of the PHO13 and ALD6 genes. Together, these changes \n\nallowed for simultaneous fermentation of glucose and xylose at various concentrations (KIM \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n26!\n\net al., 2013b). In addition to optimization of the XR/XDH pathway, additional genome \n\nmodifications have been made to reconfigure yeast metabolism in order to improve xylose \n\nfermentation (HA et al., 2011). Even with optimization of xylose fermentation, efficient co-\n\nfermentation of glucose and xylose is still problematic, exhibiting a long lag time to \n\nmetabolize xylose. Co-fermentation of xylose and cellobiose has been developed as a possible \n\nsolution (KIM et al., 2013b). \n\n             \n \n\nFigure 2 - Xylose-assimilation pathways for S. cerevisiae: xylose isomerase (XI) and xylose reductase/xylitol \ndehydrogenase (XR/XDH). Both pathways require overexpression of xylulose kinase (XK), which \nconnects xylulose to the endogenous pentose phosphate pathway of S. cerevisiae (KIM et al., 2013b) \n\n \n\n2.7 CRISPR-Cas9 \n\n \n\n Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR \n\nassociated protein 9 (Cas9) are natural adaptive immunity systems present in bacteria and \n\narchaea for defense against invading foreign nucleic acids (i.e. virus and plasmids) (ISHINO \n\net al., 1987). The Cas9 protein from Streptococus pyogenes is a RNA-guided endonuclease \n\nthat catalyzes site-specific cleavage of double stranded DNA (JINEK et al., 2012). The \n\nCRISPR-Cas9 has been engineered into a powerful technology for \u201cgenome editing\u201d. \n\nInduction of a specific DSB (double strand break) leads to activation of DNA repair \n\npathways, which are the non-homology end-joining pathway (NHEJ) or homology directed \n\nrepair (HDR). In the absence of a homologous repair template, NHEJ predominates and \n\nresults in small INDELs in the target sequence. Providing a homologous repair template (or \n\ndonor DNA) allows for high efficiency, markerless genome modifications to be made, such as \n\nprecise mutations and knock-ins (GONG et al., 2005; CONG et al., 2013; HWANG et al., \n\n2013) (Figure 3). \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n27!\n\nThe CRISPR/Cas9 system can be used to generate markerless loss-of-function alleles, \n\ninsertion of heterologous alleles, allele swaps and engineered proteins in yeast by in vivo \n\nselection (DICARLO et al., 2013; RYAN et al., 2014). Cas9 is a relatively new and powerful \n\ntool for engineering yeast genomes.  \n\n                   \nFigure 3 \u2013 Illustration of CRISPR-Cas9 system genome editing \n \n\n2.8 Polygenic Analysis \n\n \n\n The phenotypic variation between strains can be categorized as qualitative or \n\nquantitative (FALCONER; MACKAY, 1996 apud SWINNEN et al., 2012). Qualitative, or \n\nMendelian traits are controlled by a single gene (or locus) and have a simple pattern of \n\ninheritance (SWINNEN et al., 2012). In contrast, most phenotypic traits are complex (or \n\nquantitative), and controlled by multiple genes (or loci). The genomic regions that underlie a \n\ncomplex trait are referred to as quantitative trait loci (QTL) (ABIOLA et al., 2003). Stress \n\ntolerance, heat tolerance (PARTS et al., 2011) and ethanol tolerance (HU et al., 2011) are \n\nexamples of quantitative traits in S. cerevisiae. Hence, each QTL contributes a portion of the \n\nphenotype. Each QTL may include a single causative gene (QTG), or nucleotide (QTN), or a \n\ncombination of multiple QTGs and QTNs (MACKAY, 2001; SWINNEN et al., 2012). \n\nIdentifying QTLs for complex traits can be challenging; however, in S. cerevisiae a number \n\nof high-resolution QTL mapping methods have been established (PARTS et al., 2011). QTL \n\nmapping is performed by mating two strains that differ in a specific trait of interest, a parental \n\nstrain possessing the trait and another lacking that trait (BOONE et al., 2007; SWINNEN et \n\nal., 2012).  \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n28!\n\n QTL depends on a large number of genotypes segregants; however, genotyping each \n\nsegregant individually is laborious and expensive. An elegant strategy is genotyping the \n\nwhole pool (MICHELMORE et al., 1991). This technique called bulk-segregant analysis \n\n(BSA) genotypes two pools (or bulks) \u2013 the selected pool and the control pool. The selected \n\npool contains a large number of segregants that expresses the trait of interest, while the \n\ncontrol pool contains similar number of segregants that were not selected for the trait \n\n(EDWARDS; GIFFORD, 2012; SWINNEN et al., 2012). \n\n The extreme (X-QTL) method is similar to BSA, and relies on selection of a large \n\npool of haploid segregants from a cross, using mating-type specific auxotrophy \n\n(EHRENREICH et al., 2010). The segregant pool is then subjected either to growth under a \n\nstrong selective condition (which selects for the extreme of the phenotypic distribution) or a \n\ncontrol condition (without selective pressure). Changes in allele frequency are calculated and \n\nused to calculate QTL intervals (PARTS et al, 2011). Therefore, QTL mapping is based on \n\nthree steps: i) generation of a segregating population; ii) phenotype selection of these \n\npopulations; iii) quantitative measurement of the pool allele frequency (Figure 4). While \n\ntraditional QTL mapping uses a population size of 102 segregants, high-resolution extreme \n\nQTL (X-QTL) uses a much larger population size (107) (EHRENREICH et al., 2010). Using \n\nthis large population size, it is possible to effectively sample many more recombination \n\nbreakpoints; therefore, it is possible to map QTL intervals down to single gene resolution \n\n(PARTS et al, 2011). One QTL intervals are calculated, either reciprocal hemizygosity \n\nanalysis (STEINMETZ et al., 2002) or allele swapping (LITI; LOUIS, 2012) can be used to \n\nnarrow down each QTL intervals and indentify the QTG(s) or QTN(s) that underlie the \n\ncomplex trait. \n\n \nFigure 4 - QTL overall strategy - showing three-step QTL mapping strategy by crossing two phenotypically \n\ndifferent strains to create a segregating pool of individuals of various fitness, and growing the pool in \na restrictive condition that enriches for beneficial alleles that can be detected via sequencing total \nDNA from the pool (PARTS et al., 2011) \n\n!\n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n29!\n\n3 OBJECTIVE \n\n \n\nThe aim of the present study was to generate new strains for efficient second-\n\ngeneration ethanol fermentation using 1G-strains (CAT-1, PE-1 and SA-1) as a starting point. \n\nA breeding and selection program was developed based on direct mating and mass mating, \n\nmutagenesis and adaptive evolution. These methods were used to generate new hybrids S. \n\ncerevisiae strains that had desirable industrial traits, including hydrolysate tolerance. The \n\nsecond goal was to understand the genetic basis of hydrolysate tolerance by quantitative trait \n\nloci (QTL) mapping. \n\n \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n30!\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n31!\n\n4 MATERIAL AND METHODS \n\n \n4.1 Direct mating \n\n \n4.1.1 Tetrad dissection  \n\n \n\nS. cerevisiae strains (PE-2, CAT-1 and SA-1) were streaked on YPD-A (1% yeast \n\nextract, 1% peptone, 2% dextrose, 2% agar) and kept at 30oC for 48 hours. Cells were \n\nstreaked on raffinose-acetate sporulation medium (0.02% of raffinose, 0.3% of potassium \n\nacetate, 2% of agar) and incubated at 30\u00b0C for 7 days until sporulation occurred. Using a \n\nsterile stick a portion of the sporulated cells were added to 1 \u00b5L of zymolyase enzyme \n\n(ZymoReasearch\u00ae 10 units/uL), 3 \u00b5L of mercaptoethanol and 296 \u00b5L buffer, in a 1.5 mL \n\nEppendorf\u00ae tube and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. Treated cells were \n\nstreaked using a new sterile stick on a new YPD-A plate. Tetrads were dissected using a \n\nmicromanipulator (Carl Zeiss Scope A1 AXIO) and the mating type of isolated spores \n\ndetermined (MORTIMER et al., 1969) using testers strains. \n\n \n\n4.1.2 Stock culture preservation and growth media \n\n \n\n Yeast stock cultures were maintained at -80oC in YPD (1% yeast extract, 1% peptone, \n\n2% dextrose) supplemented with 15% glycerol.  The following media were used for selection \n\nexperiments in microplate reader: i) molasses-selective medium (15% total reduced sugar \n\nfrom molasses (TRS), 8% (v/v) of absolute ethanol, 0.6 g/L acetic acid, pH 4); ii) molasses-\n\nhydrolysate medium I (16.6% TRS (31% of the sugar came from Novozymes hydrolysate), \n\n5.1 g/L acetic acid, 0.79 g/L furfural, 0.23 g/L HMF, pH 4.5-5); and iii) molasses-hydrolysate \n\nmedium II (13% TRS, 3.6% (v/v) of absolute ethanol, pH 5, and the same content of acetic \n\nacid, furfural, and HMF). The ethanol added in medium iii had proposed to simulate a cell \n\nrecycling fermentation process when fermentation starts with pre-formed ethanol. In media ii \n\nand iii molasses was blended with Novozymes hydrolysate and diluted for the desirable sugar \n\nconcentrations. Cellobiose and pentose sugars were not taken into account. \n\n \n4.1.3 Direct mating of haploids from the same tetrad  \n\nFour perfect tetrads (three from PE-2 and one from CAT-1), each containing four \n\nviable ascospores, were crossed according to their mating-type (LINDEGREN; \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n32!\n\nLINDEGREN, 1943) and 73 strains were obtained from among haploids of the same tetrad. \n\nThe strains were evaluated by optical density measurements at 570 nm (OD570nm) and \n\nmaximum specific growth rate (\u00b5max) was calculated according to Tahara et al. (2013), in \n\ntwo different media: i) molasses-selective medium; and ii) molasses-hydrolysate medium I, in \n\na 96-well microplate. The plate was set up in technical replicates with 90 \u00b5L of medium and \n\n10 \u00b5L of fresh cell culture (pre-grown in 3 mL of a YPD overnight culture) using PE-2, CAT-\n\n1 and SA-1 as reference strains.  Growth experiments were performed in a TECAN Infinite\u00ae \n\n200 Pro Series plate reader at 30\u00b0C, and OD570nm was measured every 2 hours for 24 hours.  \n\nBefore each time point the plate was shaken for 10 minutes. \n\n After screening 73 strains in the molasses-selective and molasses-hydrolysate (I) \n\nmedia, 26 strains were selected for additional screening in molasses-hydrolysate medium II, \n\nusing the 96-well microplate assay described above. After this second-round of screening, \n\nfour strains were selected for batch fermentation analysis (see Section 4.3).  \n\n \n4.1.4 Ultraviolet irradiation and pre-screening of irradiated haploids  \n\n \nEleven haploids (derived from CAT-1, PE-2 and SA-1 after sporulation and tetrad \n\ndissection (see Section 4.1.1 above) of large colony size were selected by plating on YPD-A \n\nand each isolate was then grown overnight in 10 mL of YPD broth. Each overnight culture \n\nwas then diluted to a starting OD 0.3 using 10 mL of fresh YPD broth and grown until log \n\nphase (~3-4 hours).  Five mL of each log phase culture were irradiated using ultraviolet (UV) \n\nlight at 254 nm for 15 minutes at a distance of 30 cm (RESNICK, 1969). After UV irradiation \n\neach culture was plated on YPM-A (2% of total sugar from molasses, 600 mg/L acetic acid, \n\n5% added ethanol and pH 5), and kept in the dark to avoid photo-reactivation repair, at 30oC \n\nfor 48 hours. Around 15 colonies from each irradiated haploid culture were selected based on \n\nfast growth (i.e. larger colony size). The selected 151 irradiated colonies were then evaluated \n\nin molasses-selective medium using a 96-well microplate assay (see Section 4.1.3 above) and \n\n21 irradiated haploids were selected based on growth (OD570nm and \u00b5max) after 24 hours. \n\n \n4.1.5 Direct mating of irradiated haploids and pre-screening of the resulting hybrids  \n\n \nThe 21 UV-irradiated haploids selected above (Section 4.1.4) were then mated to each \n\nother based on their mating types. A small portion of cells freshly grown on YPD-A was \n\nmixed with another small portion of freshly grown cells of opposite mating type. After 4 \n\nhours, a small fraction of the mating mixture was then streaked on a new YPD-A plate to \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n33!\n\nisolate zygotes (LINDEGREN; LINDEGREN, 1943). A total of 234 zygotes (UV-hybrids) \n\nwere isolated using a micromanipulator (Carl Zeiss Scope A1 AXIO) and evaluated for \n\ngrowth (OD570nm and \u00b5max) in a 96-well microplates using two different media: i) molasses-\n\nselective medium, and ii) molasses-hydrolysate medium I.  After screening in these two \n\nmedia types, 125 UV-hybrids were selected for a second-round screening in molasses-\n\nhydrolysate medium II.  After this second-round screening, six UV-hybrids were selected for \n\na third round of screening by batch fermentation (see Section 4.3 below). \n\n \n4.2 Mass mating followed by adaptive evolution \n\n \n4.2.1 Mass mating \n\n \nA series of intra-strain and inter-strain matings were performed by mixing 100 \u00b5L of \n\neach haploid (first grown overnight in 3 mL of YPD at 30oC) in 250 mL erlenmeyer flasks \n\ncontaining 100 mL of YPD. Using haploids derived from PE-2, CAT-1, and SA-1, the \n\nfollowing mass matings were performed: 91 haploids from PE-2 (P pool), 89 haploids from \n\nCAT-1 (C pool), 50 haploids from SA-1 (S pool), 180 haploids from PE-2 and CAT-1 (PC \n\npool), 141 haploids from PE-2 and SA-1 (PS pool), 139 haploids from CAT-1 and SA-1 (CS \n\npool), and 230 haploids from PE-2, CAT-1 and SA-1 (PCS pool). These seven different mass \n\nmating pools were maintained at 30oC for 48 hours (ALEXANDRINO, 2012).  \n\n \n4.2.2 Adaptive evolution  \n\n \nSeven different pools (P, C, S, PC, PS, CS and PCS) were subjected to about 100 \n\ngenerations of laboratory evolution with an increasing concentration of sugar (from 10% to \n\n14%), ethanol (from 3% to 5.5%), and acetic acid (300 to 400 mg/L, pH 4 to 3.7).   Fifteen \n\nsuccessive transfers (Figure 5) were performed over the course of 80 days by inoculating 1 \n\nmL of cell culture from a saturated culture into 127 mL of fresh growth media according to \n\nthe Table 1. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5 \u2013 Adaptive evolution for 105 generations (15 transfers x 7 generations) \n \n\n1G# 2G# 3G# 4G# 5G# 6G# 7G#\n\n1st#transfer###1mL#####2mL#########4mL###########8mL#########16mL###########32mL########64mL########128mL#\n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n34!\n\n!\n\nTable 1 - Adaptive evolution media composition \n  \nDay!

Fifteen colonies from each recovered pool were karyotyped \n\nby pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) (BLONDIN; V\u00c8ZINHET, 1988; modified \n\naccording to BASSO et al., 2008) (BioRad/CHEF-DR\u00aeIII System), and grouped according to \n\ntheir electrophoretic profile (V\u00c8ZINHET et al., 1990; BASSO et al., 2008). Thirty colonies \n\nfrom the PCS pool were selected because this population can show higher variance \n\n(phenotypic and genotypic). However, only 15 colonies were karyotyped. Fifteen colonies \n\nfrom the original parent strains PE-2, CAT-1 and SA-1 were also karyotyped for comparison. \n\n \n4.2.4 Pre-screening of evolved strains  \n\n \nOne hundred and twenty strains derived from mass mating and adaptive laboratory \n\nevolution (Section 4.2.2 and 4.2.3) and 45 colonies from the parent strains (PE-2, CAT-1 and \n\nSA-1) were evaluated for their growth by measuring optical density at 570 nm (OD570nm) and \n\nmaximum specific growth rate (\u00b5 an) in molasses-selective medium and molasses-hydrolysate \n\nmedium I. Based on growth in these two media, 71 strains were selected for a second-round \n\nscreening in molasses-hydrolysate medium II.  After this second-round screening, 14 strains \n\nwere selected for batch fermentation studies (see Section 4.3 below) (Figure 6). \n\n \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n35!\n\n \n \nFigure 6 - Inform flow chart of screening \n \n \n4.3 Batch fermentation screening with cell recycling (Brazilian fed-batch process)  \n\n \nA total of 427 strains were generated by either direct mating or mass mating (see \n\nFigure 6 above).  After two rounds of screening, 24 strains were identified, which had the best \n\ngrowth (OD570nm) for screening by batch fermentation with cell recycling.  The parent strains \n\nPE-2, CAT-1, SA-1 and Mauri (baker's yeast) were also screened for comparison.  The final \n\nset of 24 strains included: four strains derived from direct mating of haploids from the same \n\ntetrad, six strains from direct mating of UV-irradiated haploids and fourteen strains derived \n\nfrom mass mating followed by adaptive laboratory evolution. The batch fermentation \n\nexperiments were performed to simulate, to some extent, the conditions encountered in a \n\nBrazilian industrial distillery. Five fermentation cycles were performed, and the whole \n\nbiomass was reused in each subsequent fermentation.  The following parameters were \n\nestimated (ethanol titer, biomass gain, glycerol content, residual sugar, cell viability, cellular \n\nDirect'ma*ng'of'haploids'\nfrom'the'same'tetrad'\n\n(73'strains)'\n\nMass'ma*ng'followed'by'\nadap*ve'evolu*on'\n\n(120'isolates)'\n\nTotal'427'strains'\n\nMolassesCselec*ve'medium'\nC'15%'TRS'(from'molasses)'\nC'8%'ethanol'\nC'0.6'g/L'ace*c'acid'\nC'pH'4.8'\n\nMolassesChydrolysate'medium'I'\nC'16.6%'TRS'(31%'sugar'came'from'hydrolysate)'\nC'5.1'g/L'ace*c'acid'\nC'0.79'g/L'furfural'\nC'0.23'g/L'HMF'\nC'pH'4.5C5'\n\n221'strains'\n(26'tetrad+125'UV+70'evolved)'\n\nMolassesChydrolysate'medium'II''\n(13%'TRS,'3.6%'ethanol,'5.1'g/L'ace*c'acid,'0.79'g/L'furfural,'0.23'g/L'HMF,'pH'5)'\n\n24'strains'\n(4'tetrad+6'UV+14'evolved)'\n\nScreening'fermenta*on'with'cell'recycling'\nMolassesChydrolysate'fermenta*on'medium'\n\nDirect'ma*ng'of'UV'\nirradiated'haploids'\n\n(234'hybrids)'\n'\n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n36!\n\ntrehalose, and cellular glycogen contents) and used to select strains for detailed genetic and \n\ngenomic studies (see Sections 4.4.7 and 4.4.8 below). \n\n \n4.3.1 Propagation medium  \n\n \nPropagation medium was prepared by diluting cane molasses to 15% TRS, centrifuged \n\n(10,000 rpm for 20 minutes at room temperature) to remove the insoluble material, and the \n\nsupernatant sterilized (121oC for 25 minutes). Once cooled, it was stored at -20\u00b0C until ready \n\nto use.  \n\n \n4.3.2 Starting strains  \n\n \nTwenty-four selected strains (see Section 4.3) and four reference strains (PE-2, CAT-\n\n1, SA-1 and Mauri) were first grown to saturation in 5 mL YPD broth and then the whole \n\nvolume was added to 100 mL of propagation medium and growth for 24 hours at 30oC. The \n\nnecessary yeast biomass (1g wet weigh) was collected by centrifuging at 800 x g at room \n\ntemperature for 15 minutes and then used for the first fermentation cycle.  \n\n \n\n4.3.3 Novozymes bagasse hydrolysate \n\n \n Sugarcane bagasse was pre-treated by steam explosion (STEX) with dilute phosphoric \n\nacid (9.5 mg H3PO4/g dry solids) at 180oC for 5 minutes. The pretreated material (both liquor \n\nand solid cellulose-lignin) was then digested with the Cellic\u00ae CTec3 enzyme mixture at 50oC \n\nfor 72 hours (Novozymes Latin America Ltd).  The resulting bagasse hydrolysate (called \n\nNovozymes hydrolysate) has 18% total solids, 69.3 g/L of glucose, 38 g/L of xylose, 4.3 g/L \n\nof cellobiose, 2.9 g/L of arabinose; 6.8 g/L of acetic acid, 1.05 g/L of furfural and 0.3 g/L of \n\nHMF. \n\n \n4.3.4 Molasses-hydrolysate fermentation medium \n\n \nThe fermentation medium was prepared by mixing molasses with Novozymes \n\nhydrolysate, in a way that 31% of the TRS came from the hydrolysate.  The medium was \n\ncentrifuged at 10,000 rpm and 20\u00b0C for 20 minutes. The pellet was discarded and supernatant \n\nwas sterilized (121oC for 25 minutes) in hermetic condition to avoid loss of acetic acid and \n\naldehydes. Once cooled, it was stored at -20\u00b0C until ready to use.  Before use ethanol was \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n37!\n\nadded  (3.6% - v/v), the pH was adjusted to 4.8 using 5N H2SO4, and 3 mg/L antibiotic \n\nKamoran\u00ae was added. \n\n \n\n4.3.5 Fermentation  \n\n \n\nFermentations were conducted in 15 mL conical tubes initially containing ~1 g of wet \n\nbiomass (i.e. pelleted yeast with 25% dry matter) using 10 mL molasses-hydrolysate \n\nfermentation medium. The first and second cycles were started with 6.5% TRS. The third and \n\nfourth cycles were started with 9.8% TRS (total reduced sugar), and the fifth cycle with 7.7% \n\nTRS. \n\nFermentation experiments were conducted at 30\u00b0C at the end of each fermentation \n\ncycle the biomass was separated from the fermented medium by centrifugation (800 x g for \n\n20 minutes), weighed and used for a subsequent fermentation cycle (for a total of five cycles).  \n\nThe supernatant was stored at -20oC for further analysis (ethanol, residual sugars, xylitol and \n\nglycerol). Yeast cell viability was estimated at the end of the second to fifth fermentation \n\ncycles, while cell trehalose and glycogen contents were determined only at the end of the fifth \n\nfermentation cycle. \n\n \n4.3.6 Yeast cell viability estimation \n\n \n\nYeast cell viability was estimated by optical microscopy using differential erythrosine \n\nstaining of cells (OLIVEIRA et al., 1996). Viable cells (not stained) and non-viable cells \n\n(stained pink) were counted in a Neubauer chamber, and viability expressed as a percentage \n\nof total cells counted (OLIVEIRA et al., 1996).  \n\n \n4.3.7 Biomass estimation \n\n \nThe (wet) biomass was estimated by weighing the pelleted cells, after the \n\ncentrifugation step. \n\n \n \n4.3.8 Ethanol content estimation in centrifuged wine \n\n \nThe alcoholic content was determined, transferring 5 mL of centrifuged fermented \n\nmust, into the micro Kjeldahl distillation apparatus and proceeded to drag steam distillation \n\nby collecting the condensate (distillate) in 25 mL volumetric flask. The density of the \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n38!\n\ndistillate was measured using a digital densiometer (ANTON PAAR - DMA48) and ethanol \n\ncontent was calculated according (ZAGO et al., 1996).  \n\n \n4.3.9 Xylitol, glycerol and residual sugars determination in the centrifuged fermented \n\nmust \n\n \nXylitol, glycerol and residual sugars (glucose, fructose, sucrose) were measured by \n\nhigh performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) using an ion exchange \n\nchromatograph (DIONEX - DX-300) equipped with a CarboPac PA-1 column 4 x 250 mm \n\nand a pulsed amperometric detector. The mobile phase used was 100 mM NaOH at a flow \n\nrate of 0.9 mL/min (BASSO et al., 2008).  \n\n \n4.3.10 Glycogen extraction and quantification  \n\n \nThe glycogen content was estimated by the method of Becker (1978) and modified \n\naccording to Rocha-Le\u00e3o et al. (1984). Wet biomass (200 mg) was transferred to a test tube \n\nwith a screw cap and washed with 5 mL of ice-cold distilled water. The tubes were then \n\ncentrifuged at 3,500 rpm at room temperature for 6 minutes. The supernatant was discarded. \n\nThe washed biomass pellet was then resuspended in 2 mL of freshly prepared 0.25 M \n\nNa2CO3. Tubes were sealed with a screw cap and boiled in a water bath for 90 minutes. \n\nQuantification of glycogen was performed using an enzyme-coupled (glucose oxidase and \n\nperoxidase) colorimetric assay (BECKER, 1978) (absorbance at 500 nm) based on glucose \n\nrelease after enzymatic hydrolysis of the glycogen with amyloglucosidase. \n\n \n4.3.11 Extraction and quantification of trehalose  \n\n \nWashed, wet yeast biomass (200 mg) was extracted with 2 mL of 0.5 M \n\ntrichloroacetic acid in an ice bath for 20 minutes with constant agitation (TREVELYAN; \n\nHARRISON, 1956). After 20 minutes, the tubes were centrifuged, and the supernatant stored \n\nin 1.5 mL Eppendorf\u00ae tubes at -20\u00b0C until the time of analysis. Quantification of trehalose \n\nwas performed using HPAEC, as described by Basso et al. (2008), using a DIONEX ion \n\nchromatograph (Model DX-300) using the same protocol as for the determination of glycerol \n\nand residual sugars. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n39!\n\n4.4 Pre-screening for Miscanthus x giganteus lignocellulosic hydrolysate substrate  \n\n \nThree hybrid yeast strains (133, 272, 409) showing good tolerance and fermentation \n\ncharacteristics in molasses-hydrolysate medium (both feedstocks derived from sugar cane) \n\ntogether with their respective parent haploids were used for further screening in Miscanthus x \n\ngiganteus hydrolysate and genetic studies at the University of California Berkeley. \n\n \n4.4.1 Stock culture preservation \n\n \nStock cultures were maintained in YPD and 15% glycerol at -80oC using 2 mL \n\nCorning\u00ae cryogenic vials.  \n\n \n4.4.2 Miscanthus x giganteus hydrolysate \n\n \n Hydrolysate was obtained from the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) with the \n\nfollowing conditions: Miscanthus x giganteus plant material (around 1 inch size) was \n\npretreated with 1.5% (w/w) sulfuric acid at a 25% (w/w) biomass loading at 190\u00b0C for \n\napproximately 1 minute, and then the pressure was rapidly released. The liquid phase after \n\nfiltration is referred to as hydrolysate. The hydrolysate thus obtained was stored at -20\u00b0C.   \n\nAliquots of hydrolysate were then adjusted to pH 5.5 with 3M KOH, centrifuged at \n\n4,000 rpm at room temperature for 10 minutes in an Eppendorf\u00ae 5810R centrifuge to remove \n\ninsoluble material, then filter sterilized using a 0.2 micron filter system (Corning\u00ae Filter \n\nSystem).  After pH adjustment and filtering, the hydrolysate (now considered 100% by \n\nvolume) was aliquoted again and stored at -80oC until use.  \n\nThe composition of the hydrolysate was determined by Greer et al. (2014). The M. \n\ngiganteus hydrolysate from NREL has the following sugar composition: 21.39 g/L of glucose, \n\n50.44 g/L of xylose, 4.65 g/L arabinose. The following inhibitors were quantified: 1.08 g/L \n\nsuccinic acid, 0.09 g/L of lactic acid, 0.98 g/L formic acid, 9.71 g/L acetic acid, 1.05 g/L of \n\nlevulinic acid, 0.83 g/L HMF, 1.88 g/L furfural, and 0.22 g/L glycerol.  \n\n!\n\n!\n\n4.4.3 Screening of selected hybrids and their haploids for growth in M. giganteus \n\nhydrolysate  \n\n \nThe reference diploid strains (S288C, CAT-1, PE-2 and SA-1), three selected hybrids \n\n(133, 272 and 409), and their haploid parents were evaluated in synthetic complete medium \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n40!\n\ncontaining 80 g/L of glucose (SC-80) supplemented with 20, 25, 30 or 50% (v/v) of M. \n\ngiganteus hydrolyzate. SC-80 media contains: 80 g/L of glucose (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 g/L of \n\ncomplete dropout mix without YNB (US Biological), 6.7 g/L of yeast nitrogen base without \n\namino acids (BD), 19.5 g/L of MES buffer (Sigma-Aldrich), pH adjusted to 5.5 with 3 M \n\nNaOH.  Strains were streaked on YPD-A from the -80oC stock culture and grown at 30oC for \n\n48 hours. To test biological replicates, three colonies from each strain were grown overnight \n\n(30oC, 150 rpm) in separate test tubes containing 10 mL of SC-80 broth.  The 96-well \n\nmicroplate growth assay was set up using 130\u00b5L of medium and 20 \u00b5L of fresh cell culture \n\ndiluted in sterile deionized water to have initial OD600nm of 0.3 in final volume of 150 \u00b5L and \n\nfinal concentration of 1xSC-80. Growth was evaluated by measuring the OD at 600 nm every \n\n15 minutes for 72 hours using a Tecan Sunrise, in aerobic (under oxygen-limited condition), \n\nanaerobic or both conditions, at 30\u00b0C with continuous shaking (orbital shaker, frequency of \n\n9.2 Hz; with an amplitude of 4.4 mm).  Anaerobic experiments were set up into an anaerobic \n\nchamber (Coy Laboratory/Airlock). \n\n \n4.4.4 Tetrads dissection of selected hybrids and mating type identification \n\n \nTo identify whether the strains were heterothallic or homothallic, three selected \n\nhybrids (133, 272 and 409) and the reference strain SA-1, were sporulated, tetrads dissected, \n\nand the mating type of the spore clones identified by PCR as Huxley et al. (1990).  \n\n \n4.4.4.1 Sporulation and tetrad dissection  \n\n \nThe reference strain SA-1 and hybrids 133, 272 and 409 were streaked on YPD-A and \n\ngrown at 30\u00b0C for 48 hours. After growth of isolated colonies, one colony of each strain was \n\ngrown in 10 mL of YPD broth overnight on a roller wheel at 30\u00b0C.  The overnight culture \n\nwas then diluted back to OD600nm 0.225 in 10 mL of fresh YPD and grown until log phase \n\n(OD600nm 0.6 to 0.8). The culture was then centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 10 minutes in \n\nEppendorf\u00ae 5810R centrifuge, the cell pellet washed twice in 10 mL of sterile deionized \n\nwater, and then resuspended in 10 mL of 1% potassium acetate medium to induce sporulation. \n\nCultures were sporulated at room temperature for ten days on a roller wheel. \n\nAfter confirmation of cell sporulation using a microscope Zeiss Axio Scope A1, yeast \n\ncells (1 mL) were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 3 minutes using an \n\nEppendorf\u00ae 5424 centrifuge. Cells were washed with 1 mL of Y1 Qiagen\u00ae buffer (yeast \n\nlysis buffer), and then resuspended in 1 mL Y1 Qiagen\u00ae buffer containing 1 \u00b5L of zymolyase \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n41!\n\nenzyme (ZymoReasearch\u00ae 10 units/\u00b5L) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 minutes. After \n\nzymolyase treatment the samples were kept in an ice batch.  An aliquot of 10 \u00b5L was spread \n\non YPD-A plate, and tetrads were dissected using a micromanipulator (Singer MSM System \n\n400).  \n\n \n4.4.4.2 Mating type identification by PCR \n\n \nAfter growth of spore clones on YPD-A plate, the mating type of 34 putative haploids \n\nwas determined by PCR. Each putative haploid was purified by restreaking on YPD-A and \n\ngrown at 30\u00b0C for 48 hours. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated using a YeaStar\u00ae Genomic \n\nDNA Kit\u2122. The integrity of the gDNA was confirmed by electrophoresis on an E-Gel 0.8% \n\nagarose containing ethidium bromide (Invitrogen, Life). The master mixture for one PCR \n\nreaction was prepared with 13 \u00b5L sterile deionized water, 21 \u00b5L of 3M Betaine (Sigma-\n\nAldrich), 1 \u00b5L dimethyl-sulphoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich), 5 \u00b5L 10x NEB TAQ buffer, 1 \n\n\u00b5L dNTPs (10 mM of each dNTP), 5 \u00b5L gDNA (10 ng/\u00b5L), 4 \u00b5L of 10 \u00b5M primer mixture \n\nand 0.25 \u00b5L NEB TAQ. The primer mixture was prepared with primer MAT1 (5'-\n\nAGTCACATCAAGATCGTTTATGG-3\u2019), primer MAT2 (5'-\n\nGCACGGAATATGGGACTACTTCG-3\u2019) and primer MAT3 (5'-\n\nACTCCACTTCAAGTAAGAGTTTG-3\u2019). PCR was performed using an Applied Biosystems \n\nVeriti\u2122 thermal cycler with the following program: initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 5 \n\nminutes; 30 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 55oC for 30 seconds, 72\u00b0C for 2 minutes; and final \n\nextension at 72\u00b0C for 10 minutes (HUXLEY et al., 1990).  \n\nAfter PCR and electrophoresis, the mating type (MATa, MAT?, or MAT a/?) was \n\ndetermined; all 34 spore clones were found to be haploid. The 34 haploids were then \n\nrestreaked on YPD-A plates, gDNA isolated and the PCR repeated.  All 34 clones showed the \n\nsame mating type as previously determined, confirming that they are stable haploids.  After \n\nsporulation and tetrad dissection the mating locus segregated with a 2:2 ratio for all three \n\nhybrids and SA-1; therefore, all of the tested strains were heterothallic diploids.  \n\n \n\n \n4.4.5 Screening of haploid segregants from hybrid (272) for M. giganteus hydrolysate \n\ntolerance \n\n \nA total of 47 haploid segregants (derived from 12 tetrads) were obtained by \n\nsporulation and tetrad dissection.  Each haploid was screened for hydrolysate tolerance in SC-\n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n42!\n\n80 medium supplemented with 50% (v/v) of M. giganteus hydrolyate grown under anaerobic \n\nconditions in a 96-well microplate format as described above. For comparison, three \n\nreferences strains were used: S288C, SA-1 and hybrid 272. The haploid segregant 272-1a \n\n(derived from the hybrid 272) and SA-1 were the most tolerant strains identified and were \n\nselected for further studies.  \n\n \n4.4.6 Competent cells  \n\n \nCompetent cells of S. cerevisiae were prepared using a lithium acetate (LiAc) protocol \n\n(GIETZ; WOODS, 2002). Stock cultures of diploid SA-1 and haploid 272-1a (segregant \n\nderived from the 272 hybrid) were first streaked on YPD-A and grown at 30oC for 48 hours. \n\nAfter growth of individual colonies, a single colony was propagated overnight in 10 mL of \n\nYPD broth at 30\u00b0C with shaking at 150 rpm. In a 250 mL erlenmeyer flask, the cell \n\nsuspension was diluted to OD600nm of 0.3 using 100 mL of fresh YPD and grown (as above) \n\nuntil OD600nm reached 1 to 1.2. The yeast cells were then pelleted in 50 mL falcon tube \n\n(Corning\u00ae) at 4,000 rpm for 2 minutes in an Eppendorf\u00ae 5810R centrifuge. The supernatant \n\nwas discarded; the cells were then re-suspended in 500 \u00b5L lithium acetate 0.1 M in TE buffer \n\n(10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 Invitrogen, 1 mM EDTA) (LATE). The cell suspension was \n\ntransferred to 1.5 mL Eppendorf\u00ae tubes, centrifuged at 6,000 rpm for 2 minutes in \n\nEppendorf\u00ae 5424 centrifuge and the supernatant discarded. The washed cell pellet was \n\nresuspended in 300 \u00b5L of LATE and 300 \u00b5L of glycerol 40%. The tubes were mixed and \n\naliquoted (90 \u00b5L per tube) in 1.5 mL Eppendorf\u00ae tubes and stored at -80oC until they were \n\nused for transformations (GIETZ; WOODS, 2002).  \n\n \n4.4.7 Transformation for pentose fermentation  \n\n \n4.4.7.1 X123 cassette insertion using Cas9  \n\n \nA three-gene cassette (X123), which encodes three enzymes necessary for xylose \n\nfermentation XYL1 (XR, xylose reductase), XYL2 (XDH, xylitol dehydrogenase) and XYL3 \n\n(xylulokinase) (KIM et al. 2013a), was integrated into the URA3 locus using a one-step, \n\nmarkerless protocol mediated by Cas9 (OWEN et al., 2014). The X123 DNA (donor DNA) \n\nwas co-transformed into SA-1 and 272-1a along with a Cas9 plasmid (pCas9) that expresses \n\nan sgRNA with a specific 20nt sequence targeting the URA3 locus \n\n(ACGTTACAGAAAAGCAGGCT).  The 20nt guide directs Cas9 to generate a double-\n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n43!\n\nstranded DNA break at the targeted locus (URA3 in this case), which greatly increases the \n\nfrequency of homologous recombination.   \n\n Yeast transformation was adapted from Gietz and Woods (2002). The transformation \n\nmixture was prepared in 1.5 mL tubes with 90 \u00b5L competent cells (see above), 10 \u00b5L salmon \n\nsperm DNA Life Technologies\u00ae (ssDNA) previously heated to 100\u00b0C for 5 minutes and kept \n\non ice for 5 minutes, 1 \u00b5g pCas9, 5 \u00b5g donor DNA, 260 \u00b5L 50% polyethylene glycol (PEG \n\n3500 w/v, Sigma-Aldrich), 36 \u00b5L 1 M LiAc. Tubes were incubated at 30oC and agitated on a \n\ntube shaker rotator for 30 minutes, then subjected to a heat shock (42oC for 20 minutes). The \n\ntubes were centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 2 minutes in an Eppendorf\u00ae 5424 centrifuge, the \n\nsupernatant discarded and the pellets resuspended in 1 mL of YPD broth. The tubes were \n\nincubated at 30oC on a tube shaker rotator for 2 hours. The tubes were centrifuged at 5,000 \n\nrpm for 1 minute, 700 \u00b5L of YDP removed and the pellet resuspended in the remaining \n\nvolume and 300 \u00b5L was plated on YPD-A supplemented with 200 \u00b5g/mL of Geneticin\u00ae Life \n\nTechnologies (G418). The plates were incubated at 30oC until isolated colonies were \n\nobserved (2-4 days).  After growth of isolated colonies, they were restreaked twice on YPD to \n\nlose the pCas9 plasmid.  Loss of the pCas9 plasmid was confirmed by loss of G418 \n\nresistance.  \n\n The 8 kb donor DNA was generated by PCR using a plasmid template (pX123, gift of \n\nthe Yong-Su Jin lab, University of Illinois \u2013 Urbana-Champaign) using the primers \n\nURA_X123_foward (5\u2019- \n\nGACTATTTGCAAAGGGAAGGGATGCTAAGGTAGAGGGTGAACGTTACAGAGAGA\n\nTAGGGTTGAGTGTTGT-3\u2019) and URA_X123_reverse (5\u2019 \u2013\n\nCATTTACTTATAATACAGTTTTTTAGTTTTGCTGGCCGCATCTTCTCAAAAGTTAG\n\nCTCACTCATTAGGC-3\u2019). The reaction mixture for one PCR reaction was prepared as \n\nfollows: 13 \u00b5L sterile deionized water, 21 \u00b5L of 3M Betaine (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 \u00b5L DMSO \n\n(Sigma-Aldrich), 10 \u00b5L 5x buffer (HF), 1 \u00b5L dNTPs (10 mM each dNTP), 1 \u00b5L DNA (1-5 \n\nng/\u00b5L), 2.5 \u00b5L of 10 \u00b5M primer mixture (forward and reverse), 0.5 \u00b5L Phusion Hot Start \n\nFlex DNA Polymerase\u00ae (New England BioLabs). PCR was performed using an Applied \n\nBiosystems Veriti\u2122 thermal cycler with the following cycling program: initial denaturation at \n\n98\u00b0C for 5 minutes; 35 cycles at 98\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 55oC for 30 seconds, 72\u00b0C for 4 \n\nminutes; and final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 minutes. The PCR product was purified using the \n\nDNA Clean &amp; Concentrator\u2122-5 kit (ZymoResearch\u00ae).   \n\n   \n \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n44!\n\n4.4.7.2 X123 cassette insertion confirmation \n\n \nIntegration of the X123 cassette into the URA3 locus was confirmed by streaking \n\nstrains SA-1, SA-1-X123, 272-1a and 272-1a-X123 on 5-FOA plates (1 g/L of 5-FOA, 5 g/L \n\nof ammonium sulfate, 20 g/L of glucose, 20 mg/L of uracil, 1.7 g/L of yeast nitrogen base \n\nwithout amino acids, Difco BD). While URA3+ strains can metabolize 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-\n\nFOA) into a toxic compound, URA- strains cannot metabolize 5-FOA and will grow \n\nnormally. All of the strains that were co-transformed with the pCas9 plasmid and X123 donor \n\nDNA were 5-FOAR. \n\nIn addition, correct integration was confirmed by PCR analysis and Sanger \n\nsequencing.  The gDNA of strains SA-1-X123 and 272-1a-X123 was isolated, and the URA3 \n\nregions surrounding the integration site were amplified using the following primers: \n\nX123_Up_conf_fw (5\u2019-CCTAGTCCTGTTGCTGCCAA-3\u2019), X123_Up_conf_rev (5\u2018-\n\nCAGGCTGTTGTTGTCACACG-3\u2019), X123_Dn_conf_fw (5\u2019-\n\nCTTTCCAACAGCCGAAACCG-3\u2019) and X123_Dn_conf_rev (5\u2019-\n\nGTTCCGTTTGACTTGTCGCC-3\u2019).  Purified PCR products were sequenced at Quintara \n\nBiosciences (Berkeley, CA). \n\n \n4.4.7.3 Phenotype evaluation in synthetic medium  \n\n \nStrains before (SA-1, 272-1a) and after the X123 cassette insertion (SA-1-X123, 272-\n\n1a-X123) were evaluated in synthetic complete (SC) medium using a 96-well microplate \n\ngrowth assay. S288C-X123 and JAY291-X123 (obtained from Yong-Su Jin, UIUC), were \n\nused as reference strains. Strains were streaked on YPD-A plates and maintained at 30\u00b0C for \n\n48 hours. Three colonies of each strain were grown in 10 mL of YPD broth (30oC, 100 rpm \n\nshaking, 24 hours). The yeast biomass was washed with 500 \u00b5L of sterile deionized water in \n\norder to remove residual glucose. Strains were evaluated in synthetic complete medium \n\nwithout addition of any sugar as carbon source (SC), synthetic complete medium \n\nsupplemented with 4% of dextrose (SCD), synthetic complete medium supplemented with 4% \n\nof xylose (SCX), YP (1% yeast extract, 1% peptone), YPD (1% yeast extract, 1% peptone, \n\n4% dextrose) and YPX (1% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 4% xylose). The 96-well microplate \n\nwas set up with 130 \u00b5L of medium and 20 \u00b5l of fresh cell suspension to have initial OD600nm \n\nof 0.3 and 150 \u00b5L final volume in a final concentration of 1x. The microplate was incubated \n\nat 30oC with constant agitation (both aerobic, and anaerobic growth experiments were \n\nperformed), OD600nm was measured every 15 minutes using Tecan Sunrise over a 72 hour \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n45!\n\nperiod. Anaerobic experiments were set up using an anaerobic chamber (Coy \n\nLaboratory/Airlock). \n\n \n\n4.4.7.4 Phenotype evaluation in YPX fermentation  \n\n \nSA-1-X123 and 272-1a-X123 were also evaluated by batch fermentation in YPX.  The \n\nstrains were streaked on a YPD-A plate and grown at 30\u00b0C for 48 hours. Three colonies \n\n(biological replicates) of each strain were grown in 10 mL of YPD broth at 30oC with 100 \n\nrpm shaking for 24 hours. The yeast biomass was washed with 500 \u00b5L of sterile deionized \n\nwater in order to remove residual glucose. Erlenmeyer flasks with 250 mL capacity were used \n\nfor the fermentation studies. Each fermentation (in 50 mL YPX) was inoculated with a fresh \n\novernight culture to have an initial OD600nm of 1. The flasks were incubated at 30\u00b0C with 100 \n\nrpm shaking for 60 hours. Samples were collected every 12 hours: 100 \u00b5L was used to \n\nmeasure growth (OD600nm) using a Thermo Scientific Genesys 20 spectrophotometer, and 200 \n\n\u00b5L sample was filtered and then stored at -20\u00b0C in glass screw-cap vials for xylose and \n\nethanol analysis.  \n\nXylose and ethanol were analyzed using a high pressure liquid chromatography \n\n(HPLC) method (SLUITER et al., 2012) on a Agilent 1200 HPLC system (Agilent \n\nTechnologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a refractive index detector (RID). \n\nSamples were injected onto a 300 mm \u00d7 7.8 mm Aminex HPX-87H column (BioRad, \n\nRichmond, CA, USA) with a guard column of the same material. Elution was performed at \n\n50\u00b0C with 5 mM sulfuric acid at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min.  \n\n \n4.4.8 Quantitative trait loci - QTL \n\n \n4.4.8.1 Mating type switching  \n\n  \nThe 272-1a haploid (MAT?), segregate from 272 hybrid, showed greater tolerance for \n\nM. giganteus hydrolysate compared to reference strains when evaluated in a 96-well \n\nmicroplate growth assay. This strain was chosen for X-QTL analysis (EHRENREICH et al., \n\n2010).  However, the mating type had to be switched to MATa and the HIS3 gene had to be \n\ndeleted (see Section 4.4.8.3) so that a hybrid could be formed by mating to the S288C \n\nlaboratory \"magic marker\" haploid strain (MAT? can1?::PrSTE2-HIS5 lyp1? his3?::NatMX4 \n\nHO::HphMX4).  \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n46!\n\nEscherichia coli (APA 608), which harbors the plasmid that contains a wild type HO \n\ngene, was used for mating type switching. The stock strain was streaked in Luria-Bertani \n\nsupplemented with carbenicillin plate (LB, BD Bioscience\u00ae, 2% agar, 100 \u00b5g/mL \n\ncarbenicillin) and maintained at 37oC. After 24 hours a colony was grown for 24 hours in LB \n\nbroth supplemented with 50 \u00b5g/mL carbenicillin at 37oC and shaking at 200 rpm. \n\nSubsequently, 1 mL of the cell suspension was used for plasmid DNA isolation using a \n\nQiagen Miniprep Kit\u00ae. The pHS2 plasmid was transformed into yeast using a LiAc (see \n\nSection 4.4.7).  The transformation mixture was prepared in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf\u00ae tube and \n\ncontained the following ingredients:  260 \u00b5L 50% PEG (3500 w/v, Sigma-Aldrich), 10 \u00b5L \n\nssDNA (preheated at 100\u00b0C for 5 minutes and kept on ice for 5 minutes), 36 \u00b5L 1M LiAc, 6 \n\n\u00b5L gDNA pHS2 plasmid (1 \u00b5g DNA), 48 \u00b5L sterile deionized water and 90 \u00b5L of 272-1a \n\ncompetent cells.  The tubes were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 30 minutes on a tube shaker rotator, \n\nthen 9% of DMSO was added, and then the tubes subjected to a heat shock (42oC for 20 \n\nminutes). The cells were pelleted at 5,000 rpm for 2 minutes in an Eppendorf\u00ae 5424 \n\ncentrifuge and the supernatant discarded. Cells were resuspended in 1 mL of YPD and \n\nincubated at 30\u00b0C on a tube shaker rotator for 2 hours. Before plating, the cells were \n\nconcentrated by centrifugation (5,000 rpm for 1 minute) and 700 \u00b5L of the supernatant was \n\ndiscarded. The pellet was resuspended in the remaining 300 \u00b5L and spread on YPD plates \n\nsupplemented with 200 \u00b5g/mL hygromycin (HYG). After growth of isolated colonies at \n\n30\u00b0C, 12 colonies were restreaked on YPD and incubated at 30\u00b0C for 48 hours.  These \n\ncolonies were restreaked a second time on YPD and loss of the pHS2 plasmid was confirmed \n\nby testing for loss of HYGR. Colonies that did not grow in the presence of hygromycin were \n\nrecovered from the YPD plate and then frozen at -80oC in YPD supplemented with 15% (v/v) \n\nglycerol. These colonies are likely diploid after mating type switching; therefore, they were \n\nsporulated and five tetrads dissected in order to obtain twenty haploids.  The mating type of \n\neach haploid was determined by mating type specific PCR (see Section 4.4.5 for details). \n\n \n4.4.8.2 Confirmation of hydrolysate tolerance phenotype after mating type switching  \n\n  \nTwenty haploids of both mating types (MATa and MAT?) were evaluated in SC-80 \n\nmedium supplemented with 40% of M. giganteus hydrolyzate in a 96-well microplate growth \n\nassay (30oC, anaerobic, for 72 hours, initial OD600nm = 0.3, biological triplicates). Three \n\nhaploids MATa (272-1c, 272-4a and 272-5d) showed good hydrolysate tolerance (greater \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n47!\n\ngrowth than the parental strain 272 hybrid) in the presence of 40% (v/v) of M. giganteus \n\nhydrolysate and were selected for the next step.  \n\n \n4.4.8.3 HIS3 gene deletion and verification \n\n \nIn order to facilitate the process of transformation, three MATa haploids (272-1c, 272-\n\n4a and 272-5d) derived from 272-1a MAT? after mating type switching, were saved as frozen \n\ncompetent cells as described above. Escherichia coli (strain APA 544), which contains the \n\nplasmid pAG36 was used as a PCR template to amplify the NatMX4 cassette. The NatMX4 \n\ncassette confers resistance to nourseothricin (Nat) and was used for making the HIS3 deletion. \n\nA single colony from the -80oC E. coli stock was isolated on a LB agar plate supplemented \n\nwith carbenicillin (100 \u00b5g/mL), and then grown in 10 mL of LB broth supplemented with \n\ncarbenicillin (50 \u00b5g/mL), and plasmid DNA isolated as described earlier. Each PCR reaction \n\ncontained: 170 ng of plasmid DNA (1 \u00b5L), 21 \u00b5L 3M betaine, 1 \u00b5L DMSO, 10 \u00b5L 5x buffer \n\n(HF), 1 \u00b5L dNTPs (10 mM mix of each dNTP), 2.5 \u00b5L of 10 \u00b5M primer mixture (forward \n\nand reverse primers), 0.5 \u00b5L Phusion Hot Start Flex DNA Polymerase\u00ae (New England \n\nBioLabs), 13 \u00b5L sterile deionized water. The NatMX4 cassette was amplified using 100nt \n\nprimers with 20nt homology to the drug cassette and 80bp flanking homology that matched \n\nthe HIS3 gene. Five PCR reactions (50 \u00b5L each) were prepared in order to generate enough \n\nDNA for transformation. PCR was performed using an Applied Biosystems thermocycler \n\nVeriti\u2122 using the following cycling program: initial denaturation at 98oC for 5 minutes; 35 \n\ncycles at 98oC for 30 seconds, 60oC for 30 seconds, 72\u00b0C for 3 minutes; and final extension at \n\n72\u00b0C for 10 minutes. The PCR product size was confirmed using an E-gel 1.2% agarose with \n\nethidium bromide (Invitrogen, Life). The PCR reactions were treated with 5 \u00b5L DpnI (New \n\nEngland BioLabs) at 37oC for 60 minutes, and then heat-inactivated at 80oC for 20 minutes in \n\nan Applied Biosystems Veriti\u2122 thermocycler. The five reactions were then combined and \n\npurified using a DNA Clean &amp; Concentrator kit (ZymoResearch\u00ae). \n\nUsing a LiAc protocol (see above) 50-70 ng of purified PCR product was transformed \n\ninto 272-1c, 272-4a and 272-5d competent cells. After a four-hour recovery at 30oC, the \n\ntransformation mixture was plated on YPD-A supplemented with 100 \u00b5g/mL of \n\nnourseothricin. The plates were incubated at 30oC until growth of isolates colonies was \n\nobserved (2-4 days), and then restreaked for single colonies on a second YPD-NAT plate. \n\nThe HIS3 deletion strains were confirmed using both PCR analysis and phenotypic \n\nanalysis. Genomic DNA from NATR colonies was isolated using the YeaStar\u00ae \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n48!\n\nZymoResearch kit as previously described. Each PCR reaction contained: 100 ng gDNA (1 \n\n\u00b5L), 21 \u00b5L 3M betaine, 1 \u00b5L DMSO, 10 \u00b5L 5x buffer (HF), 1 \u00b5L dNTPs (10 mM mix of \n\neach dNTP), 2.5 \u00b5L of 10\u00b5M primer mixture (forward and reverse primers), 0.5 \u00b5L Phusion \n\nHot Start Flex DNA Polymerase\u00ae (New England BioLabs) and 9 \u00b5L sterile deionized water. \n\nTwo sets of primers were used to confirm the HIS3 deletion: i) KanB (5'-\n\nCTGCAGCGAGGAGCCGTAAT-3\u2019) and his3_fw (5'-\n\nGACAGAGCAGAAAGCCCTAGTAAAG-3\u2019), and ii) his3_fw (5'-\n\nGACAGAGCAGAAAGCCCTAGTAAAG-3\u2019) and his3_rev (5'-\n\nAATGATGCATTACCTTGTCATCTTC-3\u2019). The reaction was performed using an Applied \n\nBiosystems thermocycler Veriti\u2122, using the following program: initial denaturation at 98oC \n\nfor 5 minutes; 35 cycles at 98oC for 30 seconds, 60oC for 30 seconds, 72\u00b0C for 3 minutes; and \n\nfinal extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 minutes. PCR products were analyzed using an E-gel 1.2% \n\nagarose with ethidium bromide staining (Invitrogen, Life).  \n\nHIS3 gene deletion was also confirmed by histidine auxothophy analysis, using the \n\nfollowing media: SC with all amino acids added (20 g/L of glucose, 2 g/L of dropout mix \n\nminus histidine without YNB, 2 g/L of histidine, 6.7 g/L of yeast nitrogen base without amino \n\nacids, 219.5 g/L of MES buffer at pH 5.5 adjusted with 3 M NaOH) and SC-HIS medium \n\n(with all amino acids added, except for histidine). Strains with a confirmed HIS3::NatMX4 \n\ndeletion were only able to grow on SC media when supplemented with histidine. \n\n \n4.4.8.4 Hydrolysate tolerance phenotype confirmation after HIS3 deletion  \n\n \nAfter deletion and confirmation of the HIS3::NatMX4 strains, the hydrolysate \n\ntolerance phenotypes of the three strains (1c, 4a and 5d - MATa his3?::NatRMX4) were \n\nevaluated in SC-80 medium supplemented with 40% of M. giganteus hydrolysate at 30oC, \n\nusing anaerobic growth conditions in a 96-well microplate format. Each strain was tested in \n\nbiological triplicates. The OD600nm was measured every 15 minutes for 72 hours (initial \n\nOD600nm = 0.3). The haploid strains before HIS3 gene deletion, and JAY291 were used as \n\npositive controls to confirm that HIS3 deletion had no negative effect on hydrolysate \n\ntolerance. Strain 4a (APA 2877) retained the full tolerance phenotype and was used for the X-\n\nQTL study.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n49!\n\n4.4.8.5 Pre-QTL: evaluation of the parental strain phenotypes in a DASGIP\u00ae bioreactor  \n\n \nThe parents of the X-QTL selection experiment (272-4a MATa his3?::NatMX4 and \n\nS288C \u201cmagic marker\u201d strain) were evaluated in an anaerobic bioreactor to confirm their \n\ntolerance phenotypes. Strain 272-4a (APA 2877) should be able to grow in the presence of \n\n30% (v/v) hydrolysate whereas the laboratory strain S288C \u201cmagic marker\u201d (MM) cannot. \n\nFour sterile DASGIP\u00ae vessels, 1L capacity, were set up with 200 mL of SC-80 with or \n\nwithout 30% (v/v) of M. giganteus hydrolysate. The dissolved oxygen (DO) probe \n\n(Hamilton/VISIFERM DO 225) was calibrated to maintain an anaerobic condition; the \n\ntemperature probe was calibrated to keep the temperature at 30oC, the pH probe (Mettler \n\nToledo/405-DPAS-SC-K8S/225) and base addition pump (containing 4N KOH) were \n\ncalibrated to maintain the pH at 5.5. Media was aseptically added to the vessels and \n\nmaintained at 30oC for 24 hours prior to inoculating the cells in order to detect contamination. \n\nIf the media remained clear (i.e. no contamination) then the vessels were inoculated. \n\nParental strains (272-4a MATa his3?::NatMX4 and S288C MM MAT?) were \n\nstreaked on YPD-A and maintained at 30\u00b0C for 48 hours. A colony was inoculated in 12 mL \n\nof SC-80 and grown overnight on a shaking platform at 30\u00b0C. The cell suspension was then \n\ndiluted to OD600nm 0.25 in 200 mL of fresh SC-80 and grown overnight at 30\u00b0C on a shaking \n\nplatform (250 rpm).  The cell culture was harvested and inoculated into DASGIP\u00ae vessels \n\n(containing media) to an initial OD600nm of 0.2 and grown at 30oC for 72 hours. In addition, \n\n0.005% of Antifoam 204 (Sigma-Aldrich) was added at the beginning of fermentation. \n\nGrowth was monitored and recorded using an optical density probe (Fogale Nanotech OD \n\nSensor/DN12-220-5). \n\n \n4.4.8.6 Hybrid between S288C MM MAT? and 4a MATa his3?::NatRMX4   \n\n \nAfter evaluation of 272-4a MATa his3?::NatMX4 in SC-80 supplemented with \n\nhydrolysate and to confirm its tolerance phenotypes, it was then crossed with the laboratory \n\nstrain S288C magic marker (MAT? can1?::PSTE2-HIS5 lyp1? his3?::NatMX4 \n\nHO::HphMX4) (S288C MM). The stock cultures were streaked on YPD-A plate and \n\nmaintained at 30oC. After 48 hours, a colony from each strain was mixed on YPD-A plate and \n\nincubated at 30oC. After 4 hours, a portion of the cells was spread on a YPD-A plate, and five \n\nzygotes were picked using a tetrad dissection microscope (MSM S400, Singer Instruments). \n\nThe YPD-A plate was then maintained at 30oC for 72 hours. Only three of the five zygotes \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n50!\n\ngrew. The ploidy (2n) was confirmed by mating type PCR as described earlier. The hybrids \n\nwere stored in YPD containing 15% (v/v) of glycerol at -80oC. \n\n \n4.4.8.7 Hydrolysate tolerance evaluation of hybrids strains derived from 272-4a and \n\nS288C MM  \n\n \nAfter it was confirmed that the three hybrids were diploid, they were evaluated in SC-\n\n80 media supplemented with either, 0%, 30% or 45% (v/v) of M. giganteus hydrolysate, in a \n\n96-well microplate growth assay as described above (Section 4.4.3). The parental strains \n\nS288C MM (APA 5030) and 272-4a MATa his3?::NatMX4 (APA 2877) were used as \n\ncontrols. Two out of the three hybrids evaluated showed the highest tolerance. Hybrid #2 \n\n(APA 2880) was chosen for subsequent X-QTL mapping.  \n\n \n4.4.8.8 Obtaining a large F1 pool of MATa segregants for X-QTL analysis  \n\n \nThe stock culture of APA 2880, previously stored at -80oC in 15% (v/v) of glycerol, \n\nwas streaked on YPD-A and grown at 30oC for 48 hours. A single colony was inoculated into \n\na 250 mL erlenmeyer flask containing 100 mL of YPD broth and grown overnight (30oC, 100 \n\nrpm shaking). The overnight culture was diluted to an initial OD600nm of 0.225 in 1 L of fresh \n\nYPD in a sterile flask (3 L capacity), and incubated at 30oC with 220 rpm shaking until \n\nOD600nm = 0.6 (around 3 hours). The yeast biomass was collected by centrifugation at room \n\ntemperature (6,000 rpm, 10 minutes) in a Beckman Coulter Avanti J-26 XP JLA-8100 rotor. \n\nCells were washed twice with sterile deionized water (500 mL and then 250 mL). Cells were \n\nthen resuspended in 1 L of potassium acetate 1% and incubated at room temperature for 10 \n\ndays in a 3 L flask.  \n\nAfter sporulation, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 rpm at room \n\ntemperature for 10 minutes in a Beckman JA-10 rotor and then transferred to 50 mL conical \n\ntubes. They were then pellet and concentrated by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm and at room \n\ntemperature for 10 minutes in an Eppendorf\u00ae 5810R centrifuge. Cells were treated with \n\nzymolyase enzyme (see Section 4.4.4.1). Cells were then spread on 10 plates containing \n\nmagic marker media (6,7 g/L yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 20 g/L glucose, 2 g/L \n\ndrop out mix synthetic minus histidine, minus lysine, minus arginine, 20 g/L agar, 50 \u00b5g/mL \n\ncanavinine, 50 \u00b5g/mL thialysine) and incubated at 30oC for 48 hours. Magic marker media is \n\nused to select for MATa haploid segregants. Approximately 4x1010 segregants were isolated. \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n51!\n\nThe haploid segregant pool was then scraped from the agar surface and resuspend in 20 mL of \n\nYPD supplemented with 15% (v/v) of glycerol and stored at -80oC.   \n\n \n4.4.8.9 F1 pool selection in a DASGIP\u00ae bioreactor \n\n \nThe F1 pool was selected in SC-80 medium supplemented with 0, 15 or 30% (v/v) of \n\nM. giganteus hydrolysate in turbiostat mode 15 days using a DASGIP\u00ae bioreactor system. \n\nMedia was prepared and filter sterilized, 0.005% Antifoam 204 (Sigma-Aldrich) was added \n\nand the media, stored in 20 L Nalgene\u00ae carboys, was kept on ice for the duration of the \n\nexperiment.  \n\nThe injector pump (feeder) and the ejector pump (waste) were calibrated to keep the \n\nvessel volume constant at 200 mL of medium. The temperature probe was calibrated to keep \n\nthe temperature at 30oC. The DO probe was calibrated to maintain an anaerobic condition. \n\nAlso the pH probe (Mettler Toledo/405-DPAS-SC-K8S/225) and injector pump (containing 4 \n\nN KOH) were calibrated to maintain the pH at 5.5. The vessels were autoclaved at 121oC for \n\n30 minutes. After cooling, 200 mL of medium were added and maintained at 30oC for 24 \n\nhours in order to detect contamination. If the media remained clear (i.e. no contamination) \n\nthen the vessels were inoculated.  \n\nThe frozen haploid pool (OD600nm = 298) was recovered from -80oC storage by \n\ngrowing for ~5.5 hours in 800 mL of SC-80 (initial OD600nm = 0.25) at 30oC with 250 rpm \n\nshaking. This culture provided enough biomass to start three experiments). After 5.5 hours the \n\nOD600nm value reached 0.414. Three bottles containing 173 mL of cell suspension were \n\ncentrifuged in a Beckman Coulter Avanti J-26 XP JA-10 rotor at 6,000 rpm for 10 minutes at \n\nroom temperature. The supernatant was discarded and the cell pellet resuspended in 20 mL of \n\nthe appropriate medium (SC-80 supplemented with either 0%, 15% or 30% (v/v) of \n\nhydrolysate). A syringe was used to add 15 mL of inoculum into each bioreactor vessel to \n\nstart the fermentation with OD600nm = 0.25. Samples were collected at 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, \n\n60, 80, and 100 generations (or population doublings). For each time point, 2 mL of the \n\nsample was purged from the collection line, and 10 mL of culture was collected. The first \n\nsample was collected at time point zero (T0 = 1st generation), the second sample was \n\ncollected at generation 5, after 1L of fresh medium had been added to the bioreactor vessel \n\n(T1 = 5 generations). The amount of media added to each vessel was monitored and \n\nadditional samples were collected every 5, 10 or 20 generations as Table 2. \n\n \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n52!\n\nTable 2 - Selection pool \n!\n\nNumber!of!\n\ngenerations!\n\n(population!\n\ndoublings)!\n\nNumber!of!times!the!bioreactor!received!200!mL!of!new!\n\nmedium!(vessel!volume!exchange!time)!\n\nSample!

The samples were first centrifuged at 4oC in an Eppendorf\u00ae 5810R \n\ncentrifuge at 4,000 rpm for 8 minutes and the supernatant was stored at -80oC in a new 15 mL \n\nfalcon tube (for subsequent analysis of ethanol and glucose). The yeast was resuspended in 1 \n\nmL of sterile deionized water and transferred into 2 mL conical bottom cryogenic vials with \n\nscrew caps, centrifuged at maximum speed (21,000 rpm) for 1 minute at room temperature in \n\nan Eppendorf\u00ae 5424 centrifuge. The supernatant was discarded and the biomass stored at -\n\n80oC for subsequent genomic DNA isolation.  \n\n \n4.4.8.10 Yeast Genomic DNA isolation \n\n \n The yeast genomic DNA isolation protocol was adapted from Hoffman &amp; Winston \n\n(1987). The yeast biomass stored at -80oC was first thawed, and then briefly mixed by \n\nvortexing. The pellet was resuspend in 200 \u00b5L TSENT buffer (2% Triton X-100, 1% sodium \n\ndodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 mM EDTA pH 8, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8) and 200 \n\n\u00b5L Phenol/Chloroform/Isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). After addition of 0.3 g acid washed glass \n\nbeads (Sigma-Aldrich), the cells were lysed by vortexing for 15 minutes at 4oC and placed \n\nthen on ice. TE buffer (200 \u00b5L, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 1 mM EDTA pH 8) was added to \n\neach sample and then centrifuged for 18 minutes at 4oC in an Eppendorf\u00ae 5424 centrifuge. \n\nThe upper aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube containing 1 mL of absolute ethanol. \n\nThe tubes were gently mixed by inversion and placed at -80oC for 30 minutes. The tubes were \n\ncentrifuged at maximum speed (21,000 rpm) for 5 minutes at 4oC in an Eppendorf\u00ae 5424 \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n53!\n\ncentrifuge. The supernatant was aspirated, and the pellet briefly dried and resuspended in 400 \n\n\u00b5L of TE. Tubes were incubated for 5 minutes at 37oC with 30 \u00b5g RNase. DNA was \n\nprecipitated by the addition of 5.3 \u00b5L of 7.5 M ammonium acetate (NH4Ac) and 1 mL of \n\nabsolute ethanol, and then mixed by inversion. The DNA was pelleted by centrifugation at \n\nmaximum speed (21,000 rpm) for 3 minutes and the supernatant was aspirated. After air \n\ndrying, the DNA pellet was resuspended in 25 \u00b5L of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8. \n\n \n4.4.8.11 Illumina sequencing and QTL data analysis \n\n \n Purified genomic DNA from the parental (272-1a MAT? and S288C MM) and the \n\nhydrolysate selection time points was submitted to the University of California Davis \n\nGenome Center (http://dnatech.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/) for Illumina library preparations \n\nand HiSeq 2500 sequencing. X-QTL data analysis was performed using custom scripts \n\nprovided by Dr. Matthew Maurer (University of California Berkeley, Energy Biosciences \n\nInstitute) based on the GATK variants analysis pipeline (EHRENREICH et al., 2010), i-QTL \n\n(PARTS et al., 2011), and MULTIPOOL (EDWARDS; GIFFORD, 2012) algorithms.

The relative growth of each \n\nhaploid can be assessed by colony size on a YPD agar (YPD-A) plate.  The goal of this \n\nexperiment was to identify desirable growth phenotypes using two different molasses \n\nselective media (molasses-selective medium and molasses-hydrolysate medium I) of strains \n\nderived from crossing large, small, or a combination of large and small colony size haploids \n\n(LxS). The growth was evaluated for 24 hours, by measuring the optical density at 570 nm \n\n(OD570nm) in a 96-well microplate reader and maximum specific growth rate (?max) was \n\ncalculated. \n\nFour perfect tetrads containing (four) haploids with different sizes for their colonies \n\nwere chosen and their haploids mated to each other. Thirty strains were obtained from large \n\ncolony crossings (LxL), 23 strains from large and small colony crossings (LxS), and 20 \n\nstrains from small colony crossings (SxS).  \n\nThe results showed that 47%, 40% and 65% of large colony strains came from LxL, \n\nLxS, and SxS crossings, respectively. The strain colony size is not determined solely by the \n\nhaploid colony size used in breeding, at least on a YPD-A plate. Crossing small colony \n\nhaploids can produce large colony strains, and crossing two large colony haploids can \n\nproduce a small colony strain. Only a subset of all the strains had improved growth relative to \n\nthe reference strains \u2013 PE-2, CAT-1 and SA-1: 47%, 43% and 35% of strains coming from \n\nLxL, LxS and SxS crossings, respectively, presented higher growth in molasses-selective \n\nmedium (greater than 0.5 OD570nm after 24 hours) (Figure 7).  \n\nRough colonies were the products of some crossings (Figure 7). These colonies \n\nshowed low final OD570nm after 24 hours, as a result of flocculation. This characteristic is \n\nundesirable for the fermentation process with cell recycling. These strains were discarded at \n\nthis stage of selection.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n56!\n\na                                                                                  b \n\n \nc \n\n \nFigure 7 - Anaerobic growth evaluation (OD570nm and \u00b5max) for 73 strains derived from direct mating of \n\nhaploids from the same tetrad that had different sized colonies (small x small, small x large, large x \nlarge) after 24 hours in molasses-selective medium (pH 4) at 30oC using a 96-well microplate reader.  \nThe reference strains are PE-2, CAT-1 and SA-1. The graphs show an average and standard deviation \nof three technical replicates for the final OD570nm (light green bars and light gray bars), and the \naverage for \u00b5max (green bars and gray bars). The strains are identified as (S) small colony, (L) large \ncolony and (R) rough colony. Dark green bars show strains that were selected for second-round of \nscreening in molasses-hydrolysate medium II (pH 5) \n\n \n\nThe growth difference between small colony haploids and large colony haploids \n\nmatings are more evident in molasses-hydrolysate medium I. Strains coming from SxS \n\nmatings (31-33, 45-48, 81-90) had poor growth in this medium (Figure 8a, Figure 8c). On the \n\nother hand, strains coming from LxL matings (24-30, 37-44, 50-71) showed somewhat \n\ngreater growth compared to the references PE-2, CAT-1 and SA-1 (Figure 8a, Figure 8b). \n\nThese results suggest that crossings involving large colony haploids can generate strains more \n\ntolerant to molasses-selective medium and molasses-hydrolysate medium I compared to small \n\ncolony matings. \n\nEleven out of 73 strains were selected for their improved growth in molasses-selective \n\nmedium (Figure 7) and 19 hybrids were selected for their improved growth in molasses-\n\nhydrolysate medium I (Figure 8a, Figure 8b, Figure 8c).

Fifteen colonies from each strain were isolated and karyotyped by pulsed field \n\ngel electrophoresis (PFGE).  These 45 colonies and also 120 colonies isolated from mass \n\nmating and adaptive evolution were screened for growth in molasses-selective medium.  \n\nMost of the PE-2 derived colonies had the same PFGE profile (except PE-2-C13 and \n\nPE-2-C14 (Figure 14a). However, significant differences in growth were observed among the \n\n15 isolated colonies, even though they had the same karyotype (Figure 13a, Figure 14a), \n\nsuggesting that they exhibit genetic differences that cannot be detected by PFGE. In contrast, \n\nPE-2-C13 and PE-2-C14 showed a distinct karyotype and are likely a different chromosomal \n\nrearrangement (CR), which represents a subpopulation of the original PE-2 sample (Figure \n\n13a, Figure 14a).  \n\n The P evolved population (mass mating of a mixture of 91 haploids from PE-2 \n\nfollowed by adaptive evolution) showed new different CRs: the prevalent electrophoretic \n\nkaryotype of the original PE-2 culture disappeared and two prevalent karyotypes arose: CR1 \n\n(profiles 1, 3, 4, 7, 8 and 9) and CR2 (profiles 2, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15) (Figure 14b). \n\nNevertheless a sub-dominant chromosomal rearrangement found in the original PE-2 \n\npopulation (PE-2-C13 and PE-2-C14) (Figure 14a) could still be detected in the evolved \n\npopulation, but again without prevalence (colonies P-C5 and P-C10) (Figure 14b). The \n\ngreater differences between karyotyping profiles were noticed in the region of smaller \n\nchromosomes (lower region of the gel), while the region of medium and large chromosomes \n\nwere most conserved, allowing in most of the cases to infer the original strain (i.e. PE-2).  \n\nThese observations suggest that although chromosomal rearrangements are quite \n\ncommon in PE-2 and the evolved strains, they do not have a significant impact on the growth \n\nphenotype in molasses selective medium.  A more detailed genomic and phenotypic analysis \n\nwould be necessary to understand the effects of these chromosomal rearrangements.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n64!\n\n \na                                                                                         b \n\n \nFigure 13 - Anaerobic growth evaluation (OD570nm and \u00b5max) for single colonies isolated from either (a) PE-2, \n\nCAT-1 or (b) CAT-1, SA-1 original cultures, compared to the reference original parental strains \n(PE-2, CAT-1, SA-1) and baker's yeast (MAURI) in molasses-selective medium at 30oC for 24 \nhours in a 96-well microplate. The graphs show the average and standard deviation of three \ntechnical replicates for OD570nm (light blue bars and light gray bars) and \u00b5max (blue bars and gray \nbars) \n\n \n\nThe CAT-1 derived population presented more phenotypic (i.e. growth) variability \n\nthan the PE-2 population although it had less variability in its PFGE (i.e. genotypic) profile \n\n(Figure 13a, Figure 13b, Figure 14c). The predominant profile of the CAT-1 population \n\n(CAT-1-C1 to CAT-1-C8, CAT-1-C11, CAT-1-C13 and CAT-1-C15) was lost after evolution \n\n(C population). However, the subdominant PFGE profile (CAT-1-C9, CAT-1-C10, CAT-1-\n\nC12 and CAT-1-C14) persisted in C evolved population (Figure 14c, Figure 14d). Strains \n\nderived from the C evolved pool (adaptive evolution of mass mating of 89 haploids derived \n\nfrom CAT-1) showed the most phenotypic variation based on growth and also significant \n\nvariation in their PFGE profiles (Figure 14d, Figure 15a, Figure 15b). These results suggest \n\nthat the evolved C population was a mixture of strains and further selection might select for a \n\nsingle genotype.  At least seven different chromosomal rearrangements were encountered in \n\nthe evolved C population, including the subdominant profile from the original population (C-\n\nC4, C-C5 and C-C6), but again without prevalent strains.  \n\n \n\n0!\n\n0.1!\n\n0.2!\n\n0.3!\n\n0.4!\n\n0.5!\n\n0.6!\n\n0.7!\n\n0.8!\n\n0.9!\n\n1!\n\nM\nA\nU\nR\nI!\n\nP\nE\nO2\n!\n\nC\nA\nT\nO1\n!\n\nS\nA\nO1\n!\n\nP\nE\nO2\n!C\n1\n!\n\nP\nE\nO2\n!C\n2\n!\n\nP\nE\nO2\n!C\n3\n!\n\nP\nE\nO2\n!C\n4\n!\n\nP\nE\nO2\n!C\n5\n!\n\nP\nE\nO2\n!C\n6\n!\n\nP\nE\nO2\n!C\n7\n!\n\nP\nE\nO2\n!C\n8\n!\n\nP\nE\nO2\n!C\n9\n!\n\nP\nE\nO2\n!C\n1\n0\n!\n\nP\nE\nO2\n!C\n1\n1\n!\n\nP\nE\nO2\n!C\n1\n2\n!\n\nP\nE\nO2\n!C\n1\n3\n!\n\nP\nE\nO2\n!C\n1\n4\n!\n\nP\nE\nO2\n!C\n1\n5\n!\n\nC\nA\nT\nO1\n!C\n1\n!\n\nC\nA\nT\nO1\n!C\n2\n!\n\nC\nA\nT\nO1\n!C\n3\n!\n\nC\nA\nT\nO1\n!C\n4\n!\n\nC\nA\nT\nO1\n!C\n5\n!\n\nC\nA\nT\nO1\n!C\n6\n!\n\nC\nA\nT\nO1\n!C\n7\n!\n\nC\nA\nT\nO1\n!C\n8\n!\n\nC\nA\nT\nO1\n!C\n9\n!\n\nC\nA\nT\nO1\n!C\n1\n0\n!\n\nC\nA\nT\nO1\n!C\n1\n1\n!\n\nC\nA\nT\nO1\n!C\n1\n2\n!\n\nC\nA\nT\nO1\n!C\n1\n3\n!\n\nO\nD\n#(\n57\n0n\nm\n)#\n\n0!\n\n0.1!\n\n0.2!\n\n0.3!\n\n0.4!\n\n0.5!\n\n0.6!\n\n0.7!\n\n0.8!\n\n0.9!\n\n1!\n\nM\nA\nU\nR\nI!\n\nP\nE\nO2\n!\n\nC\nA\nT\nO1\n!\n\nS\nA\nO1\n!\n\nC\nA\nT\nO1\n!C\n1\n4\n!\n\nC\nA\nT\nO1\n!C\n1\n5\n!\n\nS\nA\nO1\n!C\n1\n!!\n\nS\nA\nO1\n!C\n2\n!\n\nS\nA\nO1\n!C\n3\n!\n\nS\nA\nO1\n!C\n4\n!\n\nS\nA\nO1\n!C\n5\n!\n\nS\nA\nO1\n!C\n6\n!\n\nS\nA\nO1\n!C\n7\n!\n\nS\nA\nO1\n!C\n8\n!\n\nS\nA\nO1\n!C\n9\n!\n\nS\nA\nO1\n!C\n1\n0\n!\n\nS\nA\nO1\n!C\n1\n1\n!\n\nS\nA\nO1\n!C\n1\n2\n!\n\nS\nA\nO1\n!C\n1\n3\n!\n\nS\nA\nO1\n!C\n1\n4\n!\n\nS\nA\nO1\n!C\n1\n5\n!\n\nO\nD\n#(\n57\n0n\nm\n)#\n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n65!\n\n \n \nFigure 14 - Electrophoretic karyotypes of populations derived from (a) PE-2, (b) P evolved pool (haploids from \n\nPE-2), (c) CAT-1, (d) C evolved pool (haploids from CAT-1), (e) SA-1 and (f) S evolved pool \n(haploids from SA-1) \n\n \n\nSingle colonies isolated from the SA-1 population also showed some growth variance, \n\nbut all the karyotyped colonies exhibited only one profile (Figure 13b, Figure 14e).

It is likely that these strains did in fact have genetic \n\ndifferences, but they could not be detected at the resolution of a karyotype profile.  In \n\ncontrast, strains derived from mass mating and adaptive evolution, showed a greater diversity \n\nin both phenotype (i.e. growth) and genotype (i.e. CRs), which suggests that a number of \n\npossible genotypes are adaptive for growth in molasses-selective medium. \n\nOur results showed that among the original cultures (CAT-1, PE-2 and SA-1) \n\nindividuals with different electrophoretic karyotype are detected and also showing different \n\ngrowth patterns, although all of such strains were originally isolated from a single colony, \n\nsuggesting the appearance of variants during laboratory replication and maintenance. \n\nDue to the great genome plasticity of these indigenous strains (ARGUESO et al., \n\n2009), variants could be generated over many years of laboratory replication of the culture. \n\nThis was observed regarding CRs of a wine diploid strain in laboratory condition:  after 55 \n\ngenerations of mitotic growth in YPD medium, a CR could be detect, but after 275 \n\ngenerations about half of the population was represented by 11 different CRs (LONGO; \n\nV\u00c9ZINHET, 1993).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n67!\n\na                                                                                  b \n\n \nc                                                                                  d \n\n \ne                                                                                   \n\n \nFigure 15 - Anaerobic growth evaluation of (OD570nm and \u00b5max) for 120 strains from mass mating followed by \n\nadaptive evolution compared to Mauri, PE-2, CAT-1 and SA-1 in molasses-selective medium (pH \n4) at 30oC for 24 hours, in a 96-well microplate reader.

possible that a selected \n\nstarter strain could growth for about 70 generations during a 250 days ethanol production \n\nseason (considering two fermentation cycles per day with a 10% of biomass gain for each \n\nfermentation cycle). Additionally there are likely many occasions for yeast sporulation in the \n\nBrazilian distilleries, similar to that proposed by Sipiczki (2011) for the wine making, which \n\ncould lead to a well-adapted strain. In fact, several PE-2 variants showing CRs were isolated \n\nfrom distilleries that had improved properties. When reintroduced into the same ethanol plant \n\nthese PE-2 variants were able to outcompete the original strain, suggesting that adaptive \n\nevolution had occurred during the industrial fermentation process. One of these strains \n\npresented a remarkable acid tolerance that could have been selected for during the recycling \n\nprocess, which involves a much severe treatment with sulfuric acid (AMORIM, 2011). \n\nIn this study, industrial strains (CAT-1, PE-2 and SA-1) were used for increasing the \n\nphenotypic diversity by means of sporulation, mating and adaptive evolution in stress \n\nconditions (ethanol and acetic acid), and the results showed that crossings between different \n\nstrains increased variability drastically, in relation to not only CRs but also with respect to \n\ngrowth parameters.  \n\n \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n69!\n\n \nFigure 16 - Electrophoretic karyotypes of evolved populations derived from four different mass matings (a) PE-\n\n2 and CAT-1 haploids (PC), (b) PE-2 and SA-1 haploids (PS), (c) CAT-1 and SA-1 haploids (CS), \nand (d) PE-2, CAT-1 and SA-1 haploids (PCS) \n\n \n\nMass mating and adaptive evolution produced 120 strains.

Fermentations started with about 8% (w/v) wet \n\nweight biomass using molasses-hydrolysate fermentantion medium.

This \n\ncassette (KIM et al., 2013a) expresses three heterologous enzymes from Schefferomyces \n\nstipitis necessary for xylose utilization: xylose reductase (XYL1), xylitol dehydrogenase \n\n(XYL2) and xylulokinase (XYL3) (KIM et al., 2013b). \n\n Proper integration of the X123 (Figure 31) cassette was confirmed by three methods: \n\nPCR analysis and Sanger sequencing (data not shown), lack of growth on minimal media, and \n\nresistance to 5-FOA.  Once proper integration was confirmed, each strain was then evaluated \n\nfor growth in xylose.   \n\n \n\n \n\n0!\n\n0.5!\n\n1!\n\n1.5!\n\n2!\n\n0! 10! 20! 30! 40! 50!\n\nO\nD\n#6\n00\nnm\n\n#\n\nTime#(hours)#\n\nSAO1! 272! 272O1a!\n\n0!\n\n0.5!\n\n1!\n\n1.5!\n\n2!\n\n0! 10! 20! 30! 40! 50!\n\nO\nD\n#6\n00\nnm\n\n#\n\nTime#(hours)#\n\nSAO1! 272! 272O1a!\n\n0!\n\n0.5!\n\n1!\n\n1.5!\n\n2!\n\n0! 10! 20! 30! 40! 50!\n\nO\nD\n#6\n00\nnm\n\n#\n\nTime#(hours)#\n\nSAO1! 272! 272O1a!\n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n82!\n\n \nFigure 31 - Sequence map of the X123 cassette.

For all experiments S288C-X123 and JAY291-X123 strains (gift of Yong-Su Jin, \n\nUIUC) was used as references.  \n\n No growth could be observed in SC or YP (without sugar) in both conditions - either \n\noxygen-limited or anaerobic (Figure 32a, Figure 32d, Figure 33a, Figure 33d).  As expected, \n\nall strains were able to growth in SCD and YPD in both oxygen-limited and anaerobic \n\nconditions. Only strains that contained the integrated xylose cassette were able to grow in \n\nSCX and YPX (Figure 32c, Figure 32f).

Both strains were able to grow \n\nusing xylose as their sole carbon source and to produce ethanol (Figure 34).  \n\n SA-1-X123 and 272-1a-X123 exhibited more efficient fermentation in xylose medium \n\nthan several previously published strains (derived from D452-2) that contain the XYL1, XYL2, \n\nand XYL3 genes (DX123, SR7, and SR7e3, KIM et al., 2013b).  While SA-1-X123 and 272-\n\n1a-X123 took 60 hours to convert 40 g/L of xylose in 10 g/L of ethanol, DX123 took 120 \n\nhours to metabolize the same amount of xylose into 1 g/L of ethanol.  Meanwhile SR7 (D452-\n\n2 wild type strain expressing multiple copies of XYL1 and two copies of XYL2 and XYL3) can \n\nconvert 40 g/L of xylose into ~9 g/L of ethanol in 120 hours (KIM et al., 2013b). Kim et al. \n\n(2013b) used evolutionary engineering to further improve xylose utilization.  Between the \n\nsecond and third transfer there was a significant  increase in growth rate and ethanol yield \n\nsuggesting accumulation of some advantageous mutation(s), which turned out to be an allele \n\nof PHO13. While SR7 before evolution took 144 hours to metabolize 40 g/L of xylose into ~8 \n\ng/L of ethanol, after evolution (SR7e3) took 24 hours to metabolize the same amount of \n\nxylose into 13 g/L of ethanol (KIM et al., 2013b).

A large pool of segregants was isolated \n\nand subjected to hydrolysate selection in a controlled bioreactor for about 100 generations. X-\n\nQTL peaks were identified using published methods (PARTS et al., 2011; EDWARDS; \n\nGIFFORD, 2012) and custom Bash and R scripts (provided by Matthew Maurer, University \n\nof California Berkeley). A number of preliminary steps were needed to prepare 272-1a for X-\n\nQTL analysis (mating type switching, deletion of the HIS3 gene, and confirmation of the \n\ntolerance phenotype in a controlled bioreactor), which are described below. \n\n \n\n5.10.1 Mating type switching   \n\n \n\n The mating type of 272-1a was switched by lithium acetate (LiAc) transformation \n\nusing the plasmid pHS2, which expresses the endonuclease HO, and plated on hygromycin. \n\nAfter growth of isolated colonies (which are probably diploids), they were purified (by \n\nstreaking twice on YPD-A plates without hygromycin to lose the plasmid). A purified colony \n\nwas grown in 10 mL of YPD overnight at 30oC, harvested and inoculated in 10 mL of 1% \n\npotassium acetate to induce sporulation. Five tetrads were dissected and the resulting 20 \n\nhaploids were then evaluated in SC-80 supplemented with 40% (v/v) of M. giganteus \n\nhydrolysate (Figure 35a to Figure 35e).

The hydrolysate selection needs to be \n\nrepeated using a higher concentration of hydrolysate (i.e. stronger selective pressure) to \n\nproduce sharper QTL peaks and smaller confidence intervals. Although the existing QTL \n\nintervals are large, we examined genes that are near the enter of each QTL peak, in order to \n\nidentify genes that may be important for hydrolysate tolerance. Further fine-mapping studies \n\nwill be necessary to identify the causative QTG(s) and QTN(s).

This enzyme is required for the second \n\nstep of dolichyl-linked oligosaccharide synthesis (GAO et at., 2005). During N-linked \n\nglycosylation of protein, oligosaccharide chains are assembled on the carrier molecule \n\ndolichyl pyrophosphate in the following order: 2 molecules of N-acetylglucosamine, 9 \n\nmolecules of mannose, and 3 molecules of glucose. These 14-residue oligosaccharide cores \n\nare then transferred to asparagine residues on nascent polypeptide chains in the endoplasmic \n\nreticulum. As proteins progress through the Golgi apparatus, the oligosaccharide cores are \n\nmodified by trimming and extension to generate a diverse array of glycosylated proteins \n\n(HERSCOVICS; ORLEAN, 1993; BURDA; AEBI, 1999). The identification of ALG14 in \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n92!\n\nQTL peak 02a suggest that N-linked protein glycosylation might play a role in hydrolysate \n\ntolerance. \n\n The GLT1 gene encodes NAD(+)-dependent glutamate synthase, necessary for \n\nsynthesis of glutamate from glutamine and alpha-ketoglutarate. Together with Gln1p, Glt1p \n\nforms the secondary pathway for glutamate biosynthesis from ammonia. It also plays a role in \n\nstationary phase and starvation conditions (MAGASANIK et al., 1992; VALENZUELA et \n\nal., 1998; PETROVSKA et al., 2014). The identification of GLT1 in QTL peak 04a suggests \n\nthat amino acid metabolism plays a role in hydrolysate tolerance. \n\n \na \n\n \nb \n\n \nFigure 41 - Genes identified near the center of QTL peaks qHZT-02a and qHZT-04a (a) ALG14 region, (b)     \nGLT1 region.
