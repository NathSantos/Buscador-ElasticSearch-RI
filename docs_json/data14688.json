Pensa-se que um aumento na complexidade estrutural de \num mosaico de habitats pode favorecer a disponibilidade de nichos ecol\u00f3gicos \npara os animais, potencialmente aumentando a diversidade de esp\u00e9cies. Os \nmorcegos s\u00e3o muito m\u00f3veis, e muitas esp\u00e9cies requerem o uso de diferentes \nhabitats de forma a cumprir as suas necessidades di\u00e1rias e sazonais. No \nentanto, a sua distribui\u00e7\u00e3o ao longo de uma paisagem pode refletir uma \nresposta \u00e0 estrutura da mesma, e \u00e0s din\u00e2micas de distribui\u00e7\u00e3o espacial e \ntemporal dos recursos, assim como refletir as prefer\u00eancias de alguns habitats \nem detrimento de outros, determinadas pelas caracter\u00edsticas eco-morfol\u00f3gicas \nda esp\u00e9cie. Desta forma, a sele\u00e7\u00e3o de habitat por parte dos morcegos \u00e9 uma \nresposta conjunta a caracter\u00edsticas locais e de paisagem. Neste estudo foram \ninvestigados os padr\u00f5es espaciais e sazonais de atividade e diversidade de \nmorcegos numa paisagem heterog\u00e9nea em Portugal, constitu\u00edda por um \nmosaico de habitats naturais, semi-naturais e alterados pelo Homem, tanto em \nambientes terrestres, como sob a influ\u00eancia de \u00e1gua-doce ou salobra. Al\u00e9m \ndisso, foram investigadas quais as caracter\u00edsticas da paisagem que \ndeterminam esses padr\u00f5es, ao longo de quatro escalas focais distintas. A \namostragem de morcegos foi feita acusticamente, enquanto em simult\u00e2neo se \namostraram insetos usando armadilhas de luz, em 24 pontos representativos \ndos principais tipos de habitat que caracterizam a paisagem. Foi descoberto \nque as assemblages de morcegos dos diferentes habitats eram relativamente \nsemelhantes entre si, e que a atividade de morcegos praticamente n\u00e3o diferia \nentre habitats. No entanto, verificou-se a exist\u00eancia de uma forte varia\u00e7\u00e3o \nsazonal dos n\u00edveis de atividade de morcegos nos v\u00e1rios habitats. Al\u00e9m do \nmais, os resultados obtidos revelaram que a resposta dada pelos morcegos \u00e0s \ncaracter\u00edsticas locais e de paisagem \u00e9 dependente da escala e da guild. De \numa forma geral, os resultados obtidos sugerem que os morcegos exploram \ntodos os habitats que constituem esta paisagem heterog\u00e9nea, e que o mosaico \nde habitats lhes fornece diversas oportunidades, o que resulta em fortes \ndin\u00e2micas espaciais e sazonais. Por outro lado, foi descoberto que estas \ndin\u00e2micas s\u00e3o influenciadas por caracter\u00edsticas da paisagem a uma larga \nescala, assim como por condi\u00e7\u00f5es meteorol\u00f3gicas, e pela disponibilidade e \ndistribui\u00e7\u00e3o locais de recursos. Por \u00faltimo, os resultados indicam que as zonas \nflorestais e o Bocage s\u00e3o potencialmente os habitats mais importantes para os \nmorcegos nesta paisagem heterog\u00e9nea. \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nkeywords \n\n \nActivity patterns, agricultural, bat assemblages, Chiroptera, guild, \nheterogeneous, landscape structure, scale, Portugal \n\nabstract \n\n \nThe conversion of natural environments into agricultural land has profound \neffects on the composition of the landscape, often resulting in  a mosaic of crop \nfields, pastures and remnant patches of natural vegetation. It is thought that an \nincrease in structural complexity of a habitat mosaic may improve the \navailability of ecological niches for animals, potentially increasing species \ndiversity. Bats are highly vagile, and many species require the use of distinct \nhabitats to fulfil their daily and seasonal needs. However, their distribution \nthroughout a landscape may reflect a response to landscape structure and \nspatial and seasonal dynamics of resource distribution, as well as preferences \nfor some habitats relative to others, determined  by species eco-morphological \ntraits. Therefore, the way bats select a habitat is an aggregative response to \nboth landscape and local features. We investigated the spatial and seasonal \npatterns of bat diversity and activity within a heterogeneous landscape in \nPortugal, constituted by a mosaic of natural, semi-natural and human-altered \nterrestrial, freshwater and brackish habitats. Furthermore, we investigated \nwhich landscape features determine those patterns, across four distinct focal \nscales. We sampled bats acoustically, while simultaneously sampling insects \nwith light traps, across 24 sampling sites representative of the main habitat \ntypes that shape the landscape. We found bat assemblages of the different \nhabitats to be relatively similar, and that bat activity hardly differed among \nthem. However, we found seasonal variation in bat activity within habitats. \nAdditionally, our results revealed both scale- and guild-dependent responses of \nbats to landscape and local features. Overall, our results suggest that bats \nexploit all habitats of this heterogeneous area, and that the mosaic landscape \nprovides them several opportunities, which results in strong seasonal and \nspatial dynamics. On the other hand, we found these dynamics to be influenced  \nby broad-scale landscape features, as well as by weather conditions, and local \nresource availability and distribution. Lastly, our results indicate that forest and \nBocage habitats are potential keystone structures for bats within this \nheterogeneous landscape.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n \n\n1.

GENERAL INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\n1.1 BAT DIVERSITY \n\n \n\nBats, Chiroptera, are the second mammalian order in terms of number of species (ca. \n\n1300), only surpassed by rodents (ca. 2300, Wilson and Reeder, 2005). The ability to fly \n\nactively and to echolocate, the long life-span, the long viability of the sperm cells, and the \n\ndiversity of ecological niches conquered, are some of the traits that distinguish bats from \n\nthe other mammalian orders (Dietz et al., 2009). The dietary habits of bats range from \n\nanimalivory (arthropods, small vertebrates and blood) to herbivory (nectar and pollen, \n\nfruits and leaves) (Patterson et al., 2003), and they occur throughout the world with the \n\nexception of the Arctic, Antarctica and some oceanic islands (Findley, 1993; Saitia, 2007). \n\nBats\u2019 dietary richness, allied to the high diversity of niches they occupy provide valuable \n\necosystem services, supporting and maintaining the ecological integrity of natural and \n\nhuman-altered landscapes, as primary, secondary or tertiary consumers (Kunz et al., \n\n2011). Some of the main ecosystem services provided by bats are seed dispersal \n\n(Muscarella and Fleming, 2007), pollination (Tschapka et al., 1999), and insect \n\nsuppression (Cleveland et al., 2006; Kalka et al., 2008). All European bat species feed \n\nmainly on insects and other arthropods (Dietz et al., 2009). The suppression of arthropod \n\npopulations is therefore the main ecosystem service that European bat species provide, \n\nresulting in the reduction of agricultural pests and leaf damage, as well as in the control of \n\nvectors of pathogens of human and other mammals (Kunz et al., 2011). \n\nIn mainland Portugal occur at least 25 bat species (ICNB, 2012), belonging to four distinct \n\nfamilies (Miniopteridae, Molossidae, Rhinolophidae and Vespertilionidae, Figure 1.1), \n\nmany of which are threatened or still remain strongly unknown (Cabral et al., 2005). All \n\nspecies feed mostly or exclusively on arthropods, but they have developed distinct hunting \n\nstrategies, while also selecting foraging habitats and prey differently. Some of these \n\nspecies are \u201caerial-hawkers\u201d, which capture their prey during flight, while others capture \n\ntheir prey from substrates (\u201cgleaners\u201d) or from water surfaces (\u201ctrawlers\u201d) (Jones and \n\nRydell, 2003). Furthermore, some species actively search for prey while flying, while \n\nothers have adopted a \u201csit-and-wait\u201d strategy, detecting and hunting arthropods that fly \n\npast (\u201cflycatchers\u201d) or move on the ground (\u201cperch-hunters\u201d) (Jones and Rydell, 2003).  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 \n\n \n4 \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 Bat species, belonging to the four families present in Portugal. a) Miniopterus \n\nschreibersii (Miniopteridae); b) Rhinolophus hipposideros (Rhinolophidae); c) Myotis daubentonii \n\n(Vespertilionidae); d) Tadarida teniotis (Molossidae); and e) Plecotus austriacus (Vespertilionidae). \n\nDifferent hunting strategies are also represented: \u201caerial-hawkers\u201d, a), b), d); \u201ctrawlers\u201d, c); and \n\n\u201cgleaners\u201d, e).

Over centuries, humans have made various \n\ntransformations in these environments, resulting from agriculture and urbanization (L\u00f3pez-\n\nMerino et al., 2011). The increasing human population, and the consecutive growth in \n\nresource demands (e.g. food and space), has been one of the main causes for the loss \n\nand/or degradation of wetland ecosystems (Aber et al., 2012). The loss of wetlands due to \n\nintensive agriculture, mainly through drainage, besides reducing drastically the area of \n\nthese relatively rare ecosystems, often results in the eutrophication of the remaining \n\nwetland areas, and in their invasion by pest (exotic or autochthonous) plant species \n\n(Zedler and Kercher, 2005). As these wetland areas are lost, so are the ecosystem \n\nservices they provide, and the support of the rich biodiversity they frequently harbour \n\n(Finlayson, 1999; Zedler and Kercher, 2005). \n\nWetlands (Menzel et al., 2005; Lookingbill et al., 2010), as riparian habitats in general \n\n(Walsh and Harris, 1996; Grindal et al., 1999; Rainho, 2007) are recognized as important \n\nforaging habitats for bats, particularly in agriculture-based landscapes (Sirami et al., \n\n2013), where natural remnants may be scarce. Furthermore, they may also act as \n\ncommuting routes (Grindal et al., 1999; Fukui et al., 2006; Lloyd et al., 2006), enhancing \n\nlandscape connectivity. Menzel et al. (2005) found that bat activity was higher in restored \n\nwetlands rather than in reference wetlands and forested areas, suggesting that wetland \n\nrestoration may have immediate effects on bat populations. Similarly, Grindal et al. (1999) \n\nfound higher levels of bat activity and greater capture rates in riparian habitats than in \n\nforests, along an elevation gradient, and Sirami et al. (2013) reported a significant \n\ninfluence of wetland size and water cover on bat activity within an agricultural matrix. This \n\npositive influence is often interpreted as a result of prey availability in these habitats. In \n\nfact, Fukui et al. (2006) found that bat activity in a riparian forest was correlated with \n\ninsect abundance. These habitats may also be important to maintain bat populations in \n\nanthropogenic disturbed areas, such as production forests. The results obtained by Lloyd \n\net al. (2006) suggest exactly that, since activity levels and bat diversity were similar \n\namong managed and unmanaged forests, within riparian buffers. However, Rainho (2007) \n\nfound that water sites located within intensively managed habitats (agriculture and \n\nforestry), provide poor foraging areas. Lastly, Lookingbill et al. (2010) found that an \n\nincrease in wetland network connectivity enhanced the positive association between bat \n\nactivity and these environments.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 \n\n \n6 \n\n1.3 BATS IN HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPES \n\n \n\nThere are several threats to bat populations worldwide, resulting directly or indirectly from \n\nhuman activities (Racey and Entwistle, 2003). Amongst them, habitat loss through \n\ntransformation or degradation, and habitat fragmentation are probably the major threats to \n\nbat diversity as a whole (Primack, 2000; Avila-Flores and Fenton, 2005). One of the main \n\nreasons for such alterations is the conversion of natural habitats into agricultural \n\nlandscapes. Indeed, the majority of the European territory is nowadays occupied by \n\nfarmlands (Robinson and Sutherland, 2002, Billeter et al., 2008), and there are hardly any \n\nlandscapes free of any type of human influence (Meeus, 1995). The conversion of natural \n\nenvironments into agricultural landscapes is often carried out at the expense of native \n\nbiodiversity (Mickleburgh et al., 2002; Tscharntke, et al., 2005), and result in the \n\nimmersion of remnant natural patches in a human-managed, agricultural matrix (Uematsu \n\net al., 2010; Fuentes-Montemayor et al., 2013). These landscapes are usually \n\ncharacterized by high spatial heterogeneity, forming mosaics of crop fields and pastures, \n\nand remnant natural patches (Duchamp and Swihart, 2008). Moreover, agricultural \n\nlandscapes are not stable, rapidly changing along with human activities (Di Giulio et al, \n\n2001; DeClerck et al., 2010; Gilroy et al., 2010). Despite the known negative effects of \n\nagriculture intensification on biodiversity (Robinson and Sutherland, 2002; Tillman et al., \n\n2002; Wickramasinghe et al., 2003; Cerezo et al., 2011), low-intensive land-use systems \n\ncan actually contribute towards its conservation (Tscharntke et al., 2005). \n\nIt is thought that an increase in structural complexity of a habitat mosaic may result in \n\ngreater species diversity, due to the availability of more ecological niches, and to the \n\npromotion of several distinct opportunities for resource exploitation. This is known as the \n\n\u201chabitat heterogeneity hypothesis\u201d (Pianka, 1966; Bazzaz, 1975; Tews et al., 2004). \n\nWithin a mosaic-shaped landscape, resource availability may be spatially heterogeneous, \n\nthus its suitability to an organism may change across different regions of the landscape \n\n(Milne et al., 1989). Consequently, spatial heterogeneity may affect the dispersal patterns \n\nof organisms, as well as their foraging behaviour (Johnson et al., 1992), since the required \n\nresources may be unevenly distributed throughout the landscape patches, and the ability \n\nof an organism to exploit them may depend on the landscape connectivity. Therefore, the \n\nresponse given by an organism to spatial heterogeneity depends strongly on its taxonomic \n\ngroup, its dispersion abilities, and its perception of the surrounding habitat (Kotliar and \n\nWiens, 1990; Malanson and Cramer, 1999; Tews et al., 2004). For instance, bat species \n\ndiffer in their mobility and, consequently, on their home-ranges. Therefore, the perception \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n \n7 \n\nof the landscape of a bat which has low mobility and a small home-range, such as P. \n\npygmaeus (Nicholls and Racey, 2006), will differ completely from one of a bat with high \n\nmobility, such as T. teniotis, which is able to fly up to 30 km between the roost and a \n\nforaging site (Marques et al., 2004). \n\nAlthough some bat species seem to have strict associations with certain habitat types, \n\nmany are generalist in their use of the distinct available habitats, and often depend on \n\nmultiple settings to fulfil their daily and seasonal needs especially to deal with different \n\nrequirements along the various stages of their life-cycle (Law and Dickman, 1998; \n\nLookingbill et al., 2010). Since bats are highly vagile, they can exploit the resources \n\nprovided by different patches within a landscape characterized by a mosaic of habitats, \n\nand thus become less dependent on particular land cover types (Fenton 1997). \n\nFurthermore, habitat mosaics may favour the conditions necessary to the co-occurrence \n\nof different species, by allowing them to exploit different habitats (Law and Dickman \n\n1998), and to exhibit distinct patterns of resource exploitation, even when they are \n\nmorphologically similar (e.g. Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Pipistrellus pygmaeus, Davidson-\n\nWatts et al. 2006).  \n\n \n\n \n\n1.4  INFLUENCE OF LANDSCAPE FEATURES ON BATS \n\n \n\nThe interaction between bats and the features of the landscape they inhabit has been the \n\nfocus of several recent studies (e.g. Gorresen et al., 2005; Yates and Muzika, 2006; Perry \n\net al., 2008; Pinto and Keitt, 2008; Klingbeil and Willig, 2009), including some that were \n\ndeveloped in agricultural landscapes in temperate regions (e.g. Duchamp and Swihart, \n\n2008; Popa-Lisseanu et al., 2009; Ethier and Fahrig, 2011; Fuentes-Montemayor et al., \n\n2011, 2013; Rainho and Palmeirim, 2013).  \n\nTo focus on the relationship between bats and heterogeneous landscapes, it is important \n\nto establish some definitions associated to landscape features (which will also be used \n\nduring the following chapters of this study). Dunning et al. (1992) grouped the various \n\nmeasures of landscape structure into two general categories: \n\ni) Landscape physiognomy, \u201crefers to features associated with the physical layout of \n\nelements within the landscape\u201d; and \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 \n\n \n8 \n\nii) Landscape composition, refers to \u201cthe relative amounts of each habitat type \n\ncontained within the landscape\u201d and \u201cinclude metrics that measure the presence, \n\nabsence, or relative proportions of landscape components\u201d. \n\nAnother important definition made by Dunning et al. (1992) was: \n\niii) Landscape complementation, the process that occurs when distinct patch types \n\nhold different resources both required by an organism, and they occur in close proximity \n\nwithin a landscape. Therefore, this landscape is able to \u201csupport a larger population than \n\ndo landscapes in which these habitats are far apart\u201d. \n\nThe majority of studies that investigated interactions between bats and landscape features \n\nrevealed species- or guild-dependent responses to landscape features (e.g. Klingbeil and \n\nWillig, 2009; Fuentes-Montemayor et al., 2013; Rainho and Palmeirim, 2013), as well as \n\ndifferent responses at different spatial scales (e.g. Gorresen et al., 2005; Perry et al., \n\n2008). Nevertheless, in agricultural-based landscapes, a positive influence of forest cover \n\nseems to be a recurrent result (e.g. Duchamp and Swihart; 2008; Fuentes-Montemayor et \n\nal., 2011). Within a heterogeneous matrix dominated by agricultural lands, interspersed \n\nwith remnant forest patches, Ethier and Fahrig (2011) found a positive influence of \n\nfragmentation on bat abundance, and showed that landscape complementation is the \n\nmain mechanism supporting that relationship. On the contrary, the results obtained by \n\nPopa-Lisseanu et al. (2009) showed a negative influence of habitat fragmentation on the \n\npopulations of Nyctalus lasiopterus. The authors justified this negative effect as a result of \n\nthe large distances between adequate roosting and foraging habitats, which can be \n\ninterpreted as low landscape complementation, following the definition provided by \n\nDunning et al. (1992).  \n\nThe abovementioned studies have already provided some knowledge on the interaction \n\nbetween bats and landscape features in heterogeneous environments. However, there \n\nare still important gaps concerning the patterns of bat occurrence within those landscapes \n\nand of the processes behind them. \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n \n9 \n\n1.5 OBJECTIVES \n\n \n\nThe Baixo Vouga Lagunar, located in the Central-North Portuguese coast, is an area \n\ncharacterized by a human-altered heterogeneous landscape, composed by a complex \n\nmatrix of natural, semi-natural and human-made habitats. In close contact with an \n\nestuarine coastal lagoon, this region detains unique features, and is regarded as holder of \n\na rich biodiversity. However, little is known about the spatial and temporal patterns of \n\nvertebrate distribution, particularly regarding bats. \n\nWe hypothesise that: \n\n1.  Bat assemblages structure and composition varies among the habitat types \n\noccurring in the area;   \n\n2. Species differing in morphology and hunting strategies vary in their habitat \n\npreferences within the region;  \n\n3. The activity levels of the co-occurring bat species are limited by seasonality;  \n\n4. Bat activity and richness are explained by both landscape and local features within \n\nthe study area;   \n\n5. The response given by bat activity to landscape characteristics varies across a \n\ngradient of focal scales; and  \n\n6. Different bat guilds respond differently to landscape and local features.  \n\nWith this study, we expect to obtained important knowledge on several aspects of bat \n\necology, leading to a better understanding about the interaction between these animals \n\nand the heterogeneous landscape of BVL. Hopefully, the knowledge acquired with this \n\nstudy will be interpreted as a solid base for future research, conservation plans and land \n\nmanagement decisions, and help in the interpretation of the relationship between bats and \n\nhuman-altered, heterogeneous landscapes elsewhere. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.6 FRAMEWORK \n\n \n\nThe present study is included in a broader project named \u201cFactors that affect the seasonal \n\nand spatial patterns of vertebrate diversity and activity in different habitat types of the \n\nhumanized landscape of Baixo Vouga Lagunar\u201d, developed by a team of MSc students, \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 \n\n \n10 \n\nunder the scientific orientation of PhD and Postdoctoral researchers of the Wildlife \n\nResearch Unit, Department of Biology, Centre for Environmental and Marine Studies, \n\nUniversity of Aveiro (Figure 1.2). This project arises from the need to understand the \n\nspatial and seasonal patterns of the distribution of species that occur in the humanized \n\nlandscape of BVL, as well as to determine which are the factors influencing them. \n\nThis region, holder of a great biological diversity, is characterized by a mosaic landscape, \n\nwith aquatic and terrestrial environments, and a great habitat diversity, largely shaped by \n\nthe secular human action (Brito et al., 2010). However, knowledge about the dynamics of \n\nthe animal populations, assemblages and communities that occur in the region is still very \n\nscarce.  \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2 Satellite image of the region, institutions responsible for co-funding of the project \n\n(Municipality of Estarreja\n1\n and Observatoires Hommes-Millieux\n\n2\n) and institutions involved in the \n\nBVL project located in Estarreja (BioRia\n3\n) and Aveiro (University of Aveiro \u2013 Department of \n\nBiology\n4\n, CESAM\n\n5\n, and Wildlife Research Unit\n\n6\n). \n\n                                                \n1\n http://www.cm-estarreja.pt/ \n\n2\n http://www.ohm-inee.cnrs.fr/ \n\n3\n http://www.bioria.com/ \n\n4\n http://www.ua.pt/dbio/ \n\n5\n http://www.cesam.ua.pt/ \n\n6\n https://sites.google.com/site/unidadevidaselvagem/ \n\nEstarreja \n\nAveiro \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n \n11 \n\nThis project intends to bridge this gap in the scientific knowledge, by investigating a \n\npatterns and processes of diversity and abundance of a wide variety of vertebrate and \n\ninvertebrate taxa, belonging to several trophic levels, namely insects, amphibians, small \n\nnon-volant mammals, bats, carnivores and birds. \n\nThe scheduling of the several fieldwork components, relative to the different studied \n\ntaxonomic groups, took into account an optimization effort regarding human, material and \n\nfinancial resources, through the mutual help of the team members. \n\nThe main objectives of the project, transversal to all the studies are: \n\n1) To detect spatial patterns of diversity within the mosaic of habitats of the region; \n\n2) To assess the existence of seasonal patterns in the occupation of the different \n\nhabitats, by the various taxa under study; \n\n3) To identify the main factors behind those patterns, relating species presence with \n\nbiotic, abiotic and anthropogenic variables; \n\nBased on the scientific knowledge already acquired and to be acquired in the future, and \n\nby the means of ecological modelling approaches, the elaboration of maps of priority \n\nconservation and management areas is also intended. This will allow the proposal of very \n\nspecific management actions. \n\nThis project will be used as groundwork for future ecological research in the BVL area by \n\nthe Wildlife Research Unit team, as well as to a more sustainable exploration and \n\nmanagement of its natural resources, by giving continuity to established partnerships (e.g. \n\nMunicipality of Estarreja) and searching for new ones with the local stakeholders.  \n\nThree other MSc theses resulted from this project. The specific goals and main results \n\nobtained in each one are as follows: \n\n \n\n\u201cFactors affecting the diversity of amphibians in Baixo Vouga Lagunar\u201d \n\nGlobally, the main objectives of this study, developed by In\u00eas Torres, were to understand \n\nwhich factors determine the distribution and diversity of amphibians within the \n\nheterogeneous landscape of Baixo Vouga Lagunar. The sampling of amphibians was \n\ndone in three replicates of seven habitat types representative of the study area: Bocage, \n\nrice fields, maize fields, marshland, reed beds, sea rushes and forest. Several \n\nmethodologies were applied simultaneously, and in a standardised way. Additionally, prey \n\nabundance was assessed by using light traps to sample insects. 12 different species of \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 \n\n \n12 \n\namphibians were identified, corresponding to approximately 70% of the species occurring \n\nin Portugal. Preliminary results indicate that prey availability is one of the most important \n\nfactors behind the community composition of these animals. Furthermore, the distance to \n\nwells was found to be the best predictor for amphibians richness, underlining the \n\nimportance of those structures within an agriculture-dominated landscape such as Baixo \n\nVouga Lagunar. \n\n \n\n\u201cForaging and spatial ecology of Marsh harrier in Baixo Vouga Lagunar\u201d \n\nThe study of the bird of prey Circus aeruginosus, developed by Michelle Alves, aimed to \n\ninvestigate the species preferences of habitats and prey, as well as the factors that \n\ndetermine its occurrence and abundance. Sampling was conducted through direct \n\nobservation of the individuals, in fixed points within the study area, in a daily sampling \n\nthroughout an annual cycle. Regurgitations and prey remaining were collected, so the diet \n\nof the species could be assessed. The results obtained revealed a diverse diet that \n\nincluded small mammals, birds, reptiles, insects and eggs. However, a clear preference \n\nand selection towards Microtus sp. was found. Besides prey availability, natural habitats \n\nsuch as reed beds and marshlands were found to be positively associated with species \n\npresence and abundance. within the Baixo Vouga Lagunar landscape. \n\n \n\n\u201cMammal choices in the heterogeneous landscape of Baixo Vouga Lagunar\u201d \n\nThe study of the terrestrial non-volant mammals, developed by Sara Marques, addresses \n\nthe predator-prey interaction, being use several different methodologies for the \n\ninvestigation of small mammals and carnivores. The inventory of the small mammals \n\ncommunity in the BVL, and the analysis of its spatial and temporal distribution across the \n\ndifferent sampled habitat types, representative of the study area (rice field, Bocage, reed \n\nbed, forest, sea rush, maize field and marshland) was based on the capture-mark-\n\nrecapture methodology, involving the use of Sherman traps. An analysis of the spatial \n\ndistribution of mammals over the whole area was done, taking in consideration the habitat \n\ntype. For that, two non-invasive methods were used: sign surveys and camera-trapping \n\n(using Bushnell\nTM\n\n Trophy XLT cameras with motion sensor). The main results obtained \n\nrevealed a negative influence of exotic forests on terrestrial mammals, and positive \n\nassociations between small mammals and wetland habitats, and between carnivore \n\nrichness and freshwater courses (i.e. riparian habitats). Lastly, heterogeneity seemed to \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n \n13 \n\npositively influence small mammal fauna at the landscape-scale, and together with \n\nfragmentation, to negatively influence carnivore richness. Riparian habitats can therefore \n\nbe regarded as some of the most important habitats for terrestrial mammals within the \n\nheterogeneous landscape of Baixo Vouga Lagunar.   \n\n \n\n1.7 THESIS STRUCTURE \n\n \n\nThis thesis is organized in five main chapters. In the first chapter we present a general \n\nintroduction, as well as the framework of this study and its main objectives. In the second \n\nchapter we provide a description of the study area. In the following chapters we present \n\nthe main research questions and findings. These are presented in two distinct scientific \n\npapers. The first entitled \u201cA mosaic of opportunities? Spatio-temporal patterns of bat \n\ndiversity and activity in a strongly humanized Mediterranean wetland\u201d (chapter 3), focuses \n\nobjectives 1 to 3, and the second entitled \u201cBat richness and activity in heterogeneous \n\nlandscapes: guild-specific and scale-dependent?\u201d (chapter 4) focuses objectives 4 to 6.  \n\nThe main findings of this study are provided in chapter five, as well as some general \n\nconclusions, implications for bat conservation, and suggestions for future research. Lastly, \n\nthe literature cited is provided in chapter 6. \n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 2 \n\n \n\nSTUDY AREA \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n17 \n\n2. STUDY AREA \n\n \n\n2.1 LOCATION \n\n \n\nThe study area is located in the Aveiro district (40\u00ba39-52\u2019N, 8\u00ba27-45\u2019W), on the Central-\n\nNorth Portuguese coast. In order to complete the objectives in this study, two different \n\nstudy area sizes were defined. For the objectives proposed on chapter 3, we defined a \n\nstudy area of approximately 15,000 ha, considerably smaller than the one defined for \n\nchapter 4, of approximately 50,000 ha. This difference is due to the landscape analysis \n\nperformed on chapter 4, which increased greatly the proportion of the landscape to be \n\nanalysed. At the wider perspective, it involves the municipalities of Albergaria-a-Velha, \n\nAveiro, Estarreja, \u00cdlhavo, Murtosa, Oliveira de Azem\u00e9is and Ovar (Figure 2.1). The study \n\narea encompasses a subregion known as Baixo Vouga Lagunar (BVL), as well as its \n\nsurroundings. However, for simplifying purposes, the study area will be hereafter referred \n\nsimply as BVL. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 a) Location of the study area in mainland Portugal; b) Municipalities encompassed, and \n\nlimit of the Ria de Aveiro special protection area (ZPE).

Furthermore, a great \n\nproportion of the study area is classified as a special protection area (SPA) of the Ria de \n\nAveiro coastal lagoon (Figure 2.1), under the Birds Directive (79/409/EEC). \n\nThe landscape is characterized by a heterogeneous landscape, with a mosaic of natural, \n\nsemi-natural and human-altered habitats, including aquatic and terrestrial environments \n\n(Figure 2.2). As a coastal wetland, it presents several characteristic habitats such as \n\nmarshlands, low-lying lands functioning as a transition between saltwater and terrestrial \n\nhabitats, mainly dominated by Spartina maritima, Salicornia ramosissima, Sarcocornia \n\nLegend\n\nMunicipalities\n\nAlbergaria-a-Velha\n\nAveiro\n\nEstarreja\n\n\u00cdlhavo\n\nMurtosa\n\nOliveira de Azem\u00e9is\n\nOvar\n\nS\u00c3O JO\u00c3O DA MADEIRA\n\n\u00c1gueda\n\nFEIRA\n\nAtlantic Ocean\n\nSPA Ria de Aveiro\n\nLegend\n\nMunicipalities\n\nAlbergaria-a-Velha\n\nAveiro\n\nEstarreja\n\n\u00cdlhavo\n\nMurtosa\n\nOliveira de Azem\u00e9is\n\nOvar\n\nS\u00c3O JO\u00c3O DA MADEIRA\n\n\u00c1gueda\n\nFEIRA\n\nAtlantic Ocean\n\nSPA Ria de Aveiro\n\nLegend\n\nMunicipalities\n\nAlbergaria-a-Velha\n\nAveiro\n\nEstarreja\n\n\u00cdlhavo\n\nMurtosa\n\nOliveira de Azem\u00e9is\n\nOvar\n\nS\u00c3O JO\u00c3O DA MADEIRA\n\n\u00c1gueda\n\nFEIRA\n\nAtlantic Ocean\n\nSPA Ria de Aveiro\n\n\n\nSTUDY AREA \n\n \n19 \n\nperennis and Halimione portucaloides; sea rushes, also a transition habitat between \n\naquatic and terrestrial environments, characterized by large extensions of Juncus \n\nmaritimus; and reed beds, wetlands where the influence of saline water is limited, \n\ncharacterized by large extensions of Phragmites australis. This region is strongly \n\nhumanized, and agricultural land occupies a great proportion of the landscape (Table 2.1). \n\nThe most frequent crops are those of maize (Zea mays), which are temporary crop fields, \n\nmanaged somehow intensively, which are distributed throughout almost all of the \n\nlandscape. Distributed in a much more restricted way, and occupying only a small \n\nproportion of the landscape, are the rice fields. These are temporarily flooded crop fields \n\ndedicated to the culture of Oryza sativa. A traditional form of agriculture is also present, \n\nthe Bocage. This unique man-made habitat, is characterized by small areas of crops and \n\npastures, intersected by small freshwater courses and live fences of autochthonous trees \n\n(e.g. Alnus glutinosa, Salix atrocinerea, Quercus robur), shrub and herb hedgerows (e.g. \n\nHedera spp., Rubus spp.). In Portugal, this type of agricultural practice is limited to the \n\nBVL region, and otherwise in Europe only to southern France and northern England (Brito \n\net al., 2010). Woodlands within the BVL landscape are fragmented, and mostly composed \n\nby production, non-deciduous tree species, mainly by the exotic Eucalyptus globulus, but \n\nalso Pinus pinaster. Several localities, mostly villages, as well as numerous industries can \n\nalso be found both within and in the outskirts of BVL. \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2 Main land cover classes in the study area.

ABSTRACT \n\n \n\nWe investigated the spatial and seasonal patterns of bat diversity and activity in the \n\nheterogeneous landscape of Baixo Vouga Lagunar, Portugal. We acoustically sampled \n\nbats across 24 sampling sites representative of the six main habitat types that shape the \n\nlandscape. We compared bat diversity, evenness and richness across habitat types and \n\nseasons, and analysed the spatial and seasonal patterns of overall bat activity, as well as \n\nof individual species and guilds. From the total of 1544 bat passes recorded, we identified \n\ntwelve different species. Pipistrellus pygmaeus, Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Eptesicus \n\nserotinus/Eptesicus isabellinus stood out as the most frequently recorded. We found bat \n\nassemblages of the different habitats to be relatively similar, and that bat activity hardly \n\ndiffered between the habitats studied. However, we found seasonal differences in bat \n\nactivity within habitats. Overall, our results indicate that bats exploit all habitats of this \n\nheterogeneous area, and that the mosaic landscape provides them several opportunities, \n\nwhich results in strong seasonal and spatial dynamics. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \n26 \n\n3.2 INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nAnthropogenic disturbances, particularly those that reduce, fragment and transform \n\nnatural habitats, constitute some of the main threats to biodiversity worldwide (Primack, \n\n2000; Avila-Flores and Fenton, 2005). However, human-dominated landscapes harbour \n\nmuch of the world\u2019s biodiversity (Dixon, 2012), and have been the main focus of several \n\nstudies in recent years (e.g. Wickramasinghe et al., 2003; Johnson et al., 2008; Miller et \n\nal., 2009).  \n\nDue to the growing demands of a rapidly increasing human population, several natural \n\necosystems have been converted to agricultural landscapes (Robinson and Sutherland, \n\n2002; Kunz et al., 2011), often at the expense of biodiversity (Mickleburgh et al., 2002; \n\nUematsu et al., 2010). These landscapes are usually characterized by high spatial \n\nheterogeneity; forming mosaics of crop fields, pastures and remnant natural patches \n\n(Duchamp and Swihart, 2008). Furthermore, agricultural landscapes are not stable, since \n\nthey change rapidly in concert with human activities (Di Giulio et al., 2001; DeClerck et al., \n\n2010; Gilroy et al., 2010). The intensification of farming (Wickramasinghe et al., 2003), \n\nalong with loss of landscape elements such as hedgerows and boundaries (Tscharntke et \n\nal., 2005; Mehr et al., 2011), increasing use of pesticides (Canova and Fasola, 1991; \n\nJones et al., 2009), and land abandonment (Rainho et al., 2010), are known to be some of \n\nthe main threats to several animal groups that occur in these strongly human-dominated \n\nlandscapes.  \n\nDespite the growing efforts towards the conservation of foraging habitats of threatened \n\nspecies within agricultural landscapes in Europe (Rainho and Palmeirim, 2011), \n\nmultidisciplinary approaches combining land owners, researchers and law makers are still \n\nneeded to create adequate conservation and management plans for these areas \n\n(Pimentel et al., 1992; Ornerod et al., 2003). Knowledge about the responses of fauna and \n\nflora to habitat transformation is therefore a key issue in the conservation of species that \n\noccur within heterogeneous landscapes (Uematsu et al., 2010; L\u00f3pez-Ar\u00e9valo et al., \n\n2011). However, understanding and predicting the mechanisms behind those responses \n\nstill present a major challenge for biologists (Bernard and Fenton, 2007). \n\nBats form an incredibly diverse group both taxonomically (with about 1300 species \n\npresently described, Kunz et al., 2011) and ecologically, with several distinct life-histories, \n\nbehavioural patterns and feeding and roosting habits (Patterson et al., 2003; Simmons \n\nand Conway, 2003). The dietary richness of bats (as primary, secondary or tertiary \n\n\n\nA MOSAIC OF OPPORTUNITIES \n\n \n27 \n\nconsumers) makes them extremely valuable to ecosystems, as they play a key role in \n\nsupporting both natural and human-dominated landscapes (Lumsden and Bennett, 2005; \n\nMuscarella and Fleming, 2007; Kunz et al., 2011; Jung et al., 2012). All European bat \n\nspecies feed mainly on insects and other arthropods (Dietz et al., 2009). Therefore, the \n\nmain ecosystem service that European bat species provide is the suppression of \n\narthropod populations, resulting in the reduction of agricultural pests and leaf damage, as \n\nwell as in the control of vectors of pathogens of humans and other mammals (Kunz et al. , \n\n2011). Furthermore, bats are also very good bioindicators and are used for assessing \n\nhabitat quality, as well as for interpreting the effects of human-induced changes on \n\necosystems (Wicramasinghe et al., 2003; Jones et al., 2009; but see Cunto and Bernard, \n\n2012). Indeed, the rapid ecosystem changes caused by humans, such as fragmentation \n\nor destruction of roosting and foraging habitats, have been linked to the decline and \n\nisolation of bat populations all over the world (Jones et al., 2003; Akasaka et al., 2009). \n\nIn spite of being relatively stable within a given landscape, species composition varies \n\namongst the several habitat types that shape that landscape (Moreno and Halffter, 2001; \n\nRamos Pereira et al., 2009; Avila-Cabadilla et al., 2012). These differences in species \n\ndistribution may reflect a preference for some habitats relative to others according to a \n\nspecies sorting patch dynamics model (see Leibold et al., 2004; Cottenie, 2005; Holyoak \n\net al., 2005 for reviews of patch dynamics models). \n\nTherefore, knowledge about habitat use by bats, including foraging and roosting habitats, \n\nshould be one of the main foundations on which conservation and land management \n\ndecisions are made (Stebbings, 1988; Walsh and Harris, 1996).  \n\nBats seem to select habitats on the basis of a series of hierarchical decisions, both at \n\nlandscape and local scales (Ford et al., 2006). At landscape scale, bat habitat use is \n\nmainly dictated by day-roost availability, proximity to winter hibernacula and foraging sites, \n\npresence of water sources, climate conditions and human-induced disturbances \n\n(Furlonger et al., 1987; Gehrt and Chelsvig, 2003; Evelyn et al., 2004; Ford et al., 2006; \n\nJohnson et al., 2008, Rainho et al., 2010), while at the local scale, site selection is often \n\ninfluenced by proximity to riparian habitats, vegetation structure, morphological and \n\necholocation characteristics, and prey preferences (Aldridge and Rautenbach, 1987; Ford \n\net al., 2005, 2006; Johnson et al., 2008). Thus, habitat selection is a species-specific \n\nprocess, often reflecting species\u2019 morphological characters, as well as their foraging \n\nstrategies and echolocation call structures (Kalko and Schnitzler, 1993; Lundy and \n\nMontgomery, 2010). While some species are generalist users of habitats, others seem to \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \n28 \n\nhave strict associations with specific habitat types. Together with their ecological diversity \n\nand flexibility, the high mobility of bats (enabled by their ability to fly rather long distances \n\nat relatively low energetic costs) often makes their species-habitat associations difficult to \n\nassess. This seems to be particularly true when the landscape matrix is characterized by \n\na mosaic of habitats, allowing bats to explore different sites and to become less \n\ndependent on a particular setting (Fenton, 1997). However, habitat mosaics may favour \n\nthe conditions necessary to allow co-occurring species to feed in different habitats (Law \n\nand Dickman, 1998), and to exhibit distinct patterns of resource exploitation, even when \n\nthey are morphologically similar (e.g. Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Pipistrellus pygmaeus, \n\nDavidson-Watts et al., 2006). Therefore, the analysis of these spatial patterns of co-\n\nexisting species may provide important information about the mechanisms of resource \n\nselection and partitioning between species (Aguiar and Marinho-Filho, 2004). \n\nThe activity of insectivorous bats in temperate regions is strongly limited by the cold winter \n\ntemperatures and the consequent food shortages (Kapfer and Aron, 2007). Furthermore, \n\nbat flight and foraging activity often reveal daily and seasonal variations, reflecting \n\nchanges in insect availability (Bartonicka and Zukal, 2003) and weather conditions, which \n\ncan directly or indirectly influence bat activity (Meyer et al., 2004).  \n\nIn this study, we aim to investigate seasonal and spatial patterns of bat diversity and \n\nactivity in the Baixo Vouga Lagunar area, Central-West Portugal. Here, the landscape is \n\ncharacterized by a matrix of natural wetland formations (from fresh to brackish water), \n\ninterspersed by intensive and extensive agricultural fields, pastures and production \n\nforests. Specifically, our objectives are: 1) to identify and characterize the bat \n\nassemblages of the main habitat types occurring in the area; 2) to assess how different \n\nspecies differing in morphology and hunting strategies vary in their habitat preferences \n\nwithin the region, and 3)  to examine the seasonal activity patterns of the co-occurring bat \n\nspecies. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nA MOSAIC OF OPPORTUNITIES \n\n \n29 \n\n3.2. MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n \n\nStudy Area \n\n \n\nThe study area (Figure 3.1) is located in the Aveiro district (40\u00ba39-50\u2019N, 8\u00ba30-42\u2019W) on the \n\nnorthern Portuguese coast. It has an area of approximately 15,000 ha and encompasses \n\na region known as Baixo Vouga Lagunar (BVL). Hereafter, we refer to our study area as \n\nBVL, although it also encompasses the surrounding areas of that region. It is limited to the \n\nSouth by the Vouga River estuary and to the West by an estuarine coastal lagoon, Ria de \n\nAveiro. The landscape reflects an ecotone between water- and land-based habitats, \n\nharbouring several characteristic habitats such as marshlands, reed beds and sea rushes. \n\nThe region is strongly humanized, with many agricultural fields, forest monocultures and \n\nurbanizations. Eight different types of habitat were distinguished within the study area: \n\n \n\nI. Bocage: this unique habitat is characterized by small areas of crops and pastures, \n\nsurrounded by live fences of autochthonous trees (e.g. Alnus glutinosa, Salix atrocinerea, \n\nQuercus robur), shrub and herb hedgerows (e.g. Hedera spp., Rubus spp.) and small \n\nfreshwater courses. The distribution of Bocage in Portugal is limited to the BVL region \n\nand, besides this area, it only occurs in southern France and northern England (Brito et \n\nal., 2010); \n\nII. Forest: includes woodland patches mainly of Eucalyptus globulus and Pinus \n\npinaster monocultures; \n\nIII. Maize fields: these are temporary crop fields mainly dominated by maize (Zea \n\nmays) cultures; \n\nIV. Marshland: low-lying lands functioning as a transition between saltwater and \n\nterrestrial habitats. The vegetation is mainly dominated by Spartina maritima, Salicornia \n\nramosissima, Sarcocornia perennis and Halimione portucaloides; \n\nV. Reed beds: these are wetlands where the influence of saline water is limited, \n\ncharacterized by large extensions of Phragmites australis; \n\nVI. Rice fields: these are temporarily flooded crop fields dedicated to rice culture \n\n(Oryza sp.); \n\nVII. Sea rushes: transition habitat between aquatic and land habitats, characterized by \n\nlarge extensions of Juncus maritimus; \n\nVIII. Urban: human settlements, with artificial lighting and asphalt roads. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \n30 \n\nThe area is characterized by a temperate climate with a strong Atlantic influence, with \n\nwell-defined seasonal variation both in air temperature (registered mean annual \n\ntemperature of 14.5 \u00baC, with an amplitude between 8.5 \u00baC in February and 19.8 \u00baC in \n\nSeptember), and rainfall (registered annual precipitation of 627.6 mm, varying between \n\n5.6 mm in July and 194 mm in November). BVL is also characterized by high humidity \n\nthroughout the year (mean annual humidity of 76.5%) (air temperature and humidity data \n\nfrom CUF weather station, and precipitation from CESAMET, all relative to the \n\nOctober\u201911-September\u201912 period). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 Approximate location of the study area in the Iberian Peninsula, main land use \n\ncharacterization and location of the sampling sites.

Acoustic sampling was done in \n\nthree replicates of each habitat type, at a total of 24 sites. Sites were chosen at a \n\nminimum intervening distance of 1 km to reduce spatial autocorrelation. Since variation \n\nbetween nights and sites can be significant (Broders, 2003; Wickramasinghe et al., 2003; \n\nFord et al., 2005), each site was sampled twice a month, between October 2011 and \n\nSeptember 2012, except during the months of April and July when the weather conditions \n\nonly allowed each site to be sampled once. No sampling was carried out on nights with \n\nunfavourable weather conditions such as rain or strong winds, since bat activity (Ford et \n\nal., 2005, 2006) and detectability (Dixon, 2012) are negatively affected by these \n\nconditions. Acoustic sampling was done within the first 2.5h-3h after dusk, when bat \n\nactivity levels are highest (Rydell et al., 1996; Hayes, 1997). The nightly order of site \n\nvisitation was chosen randomly, so that data bias could be avoided. \n\nFor each site, a 15-minute walking survey was carried out using a Pettersson D240x ultra-\n\nsound detector (Pettersson Elektronik AB\nTM\n\n, Uppsala, Sweden) in heterodyne mode, \n\nrapidly travelling through the full range of frequencies so that the chance of detecting \n\ndifferent bat species was maximized (Russ and Montgomery, 2002). Sample calls of 1.7 \n\nseconds were recorded in time expansion mode into a digital recorder (Edirol R-09, \n\nRoland Corp., Shizuoka, Japan). Walking surveys were carried out at a regular pace so \n\nthat all transects were approximately 500 m in length. \n\nBat calls were analysed using Audacity 1.3.13 software (http://audacity.sourceforge.net). \n\nCall duration, inter-pulse interval, start and end frequencies and peak frequency \n\n(frequency containing most energy) were registered. Species identification was done \n\nusing a reference collection of bat calls and dichotomous keys for Portuguese and Iberian \n\nbat species (Lis\u00f3n, 2011; Rainho et al., 2011). When two species could not be \n\ndistinguished by their echolocation calls, they were grouped into two-species complexes, \n\nas shown in Table 3.1. \n\nThree types of calls were discriminated: (1) echolocation passes, defined as a sequence \n\nof echolocation pulses emitted by bats while navigating and searching for food (Lookingbill \n\net al., 2010), (2) feeding buzzes, characterized by an approach phase with progressively \n\nlower signal duration and pulse interval, ending in a series of short signals with high \n\nrepetition rate (Schnitzler and Kalko, 2001), and (3) social calls, defined as broadband \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \n32 \n\ncalls of longer duration than echolocation calls, with multiple low-frequency components \n\n(Altringham and Fenton 2009). \n\nStatistical analysis \n\n \n\nPatterns of species richness, diversity and composition \n\n \n\nWe calculated three indices within the eight main habitat types that compose the BVL \n\nlandscape: diversity, evenness and species richness. Since most diversity indices \n\nemployed actually refer to entropies rather than true diversities (Keylock, 2005; Jost, \n\n2006), we used a conversion of the Shannon-Wiener index (H) on its \u201cnumbers \n\nequivalent\u201d as a measure of diversity, as proposed by Jost (2006). Hereafter, this diversity \n\nmeasure is simply referred to as diversity (D). We also used a modified Pielou\u2019s evenness \n\n\u2013 hereafter, termed evenness (E) \u2013 that was calculated using D instead of H. We then \n\nperformed generalized linear models (GLM) and Tukey post-hoc multiple comparisons for \n\neach index to assess differences between seasons and habitat types. In addition, we \n\nperformed an analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) to evaluate the significance of the \n\ndifferences between the species composition of the studied habitats. \n\n \n\nActivity of species and guilds \n\n \n\nSeveral methods have been used in the literature to measure bat activity, such as \n\ncounting the absolute numbers of search-phase echolocation calls (Avila-Flores and \n\nFenton, 2005), counting the number of minutes in which bats are registered (McAney and \n\nFariley, 1988), calculating the mean number of passes per night for each sampling site \n\n(Gehrt and Chelsvig, 2003), summing the number of one-minute periods in which a \n\nspecies was recorded (Activity Index; Miller, 2001) or the sizes of files recorded in a \n\nspecific space and time unit (Broders, 2003). However, despite this variety, none of the \n\nabove methods discriminate between passes of commuting bats and passes actually \n\nmade by bats foraging in the sampled site (Carmel and Safriel, 1998). For this reason, \n\nand to overcome differences in sampling effort, we estimated bat activity using the \n\nnumber of bat passes per 15 minute interval (i.e. the number of passes per transect).  \n\nFor the seven species with more than 10 recorded passes (Table 3.1), we performed a \n\nhierarchical clustering analysis based on percentage of habitat use and assessed \n\nspecies-specific temporal and spatial patterns of activity. \n\n\n\nA MOSAIC OF OPPORTUNITIES \n\n \n33 \n\nTo test for overall bat activity, feeding activity and social behaviour dependence on habitat \n\ntype and seasonality, we performed generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) on overall \n\nbat passes, feeding buzzes and social calls. We then carried out Tukey post-hoc multiple \n\ncomparisons for each model to detect which habitats and seasons were significantly \n\ndistinct. To evaluate differences in bat activity between habitats in each season, we \n\nperformed GLMM on overall bat passes, followed by multiple comparisons. We also \n\ncarried out GLMM to test for species activity dependence on habitat type and seasonality, \n\ntogether with multiple comparisons for each model to assess differences between habitats \n\nand seasons. Because species with low intensity or very high frequency calls may be \n\nunderrepresented (Ciechanowski, 2002; Hayes et al., 2009), no comparisons between \n\nactivity levels of different species were made.  Since echolocation-monitoring studies are \n\nunable to provide a true count of individuals (Hayes et al., 2009), the data was not \n\ninterpreted as a measure of abundance, but rather as an estimate of bat activity. This \n\nenables the comparison of relative use between different habitat types and of the variation \n\nin habitat use over time (Hayes, 2000). \n\nWe divided bat species into three guilds based on eco-morphological traits (Fenton, 1990; \n\nSchnitzler and Kalko, 2001). Species that have a fast and energetically inexpensive flight \n\ntype, with high wing loading and aspect ratio, and emit long, narrowband and low-\n\nfrequency calls, were considered as \u201copen-space foragers\u201d. Species that present a slow \n\nand energetically inexpensive flight type, with average wing loading and aspect ratio, and \n\necholocate through short pulses that are often composed of both broad and narrowband \n\ncomponents, were considered as \u201cedge foragers\u201d. Lastly, species with low wing loading \n\nand aspect ratio, i.e. energetically expensive but very manoeuvrable flight, and whose \n\necholocation is characterized by low-intensity, broadband calls, were considered as \n\n\u201cclosed-habitat foragers\u201d. The species within each guild are presented in Table 3.1. Since \n\nwe only recorded P. auritus/P. austriacus (the only closed-habitat species recorded) on \n\none occasion, this guild was not included in the analysis. For the other two guilds, we \n\nperformed GLMM and multiple comparisons, to assess differences in bat activity between \n\nhabitat types and seasons. Calls identified to genus level or to species-complexes were \n\nincluded in this analysis whenever the group of potential species all belonged to the same \n\nguild. \n\nANOSIM was performed with Past software, version 2.17c (Hammer et al., 2001); all the \n\nremaining statistical analysis were performed with software R, version 2.15.1 (R Core \n\nTeam, 2013). The level of significance was established at p?0.05, although we also report \n\nand discuss near significant probability values at p<0.1. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \n34 \n\n \n\n3.3. RESULTS \n\n \n\nSpatial patterns of species richness, diversity and composition \n\n \n\nOf the total of 1544 bat passes recorded during this study, we identified 1262 (82%) to \n\nspecies level (Table 3.1). The identified species (or two-species complexes) were \n\nBarbastella barbastellus, Eptesicus serotinus/E. isabellinus, Myotis daubentonii, M. \n\nescalerai, M. myotis/M. blythii, Nyctalus lasiopterus/N. noctula, N. leisleri, Pipistrellus \n\nkuhlii, P. pipistrellus, P. pygmaeus, Plecotus auritus/P. austriacus and Tadarida teniotis. \n\nThe remaining recordings were classified as Eptesicus spp./Nyctalus spp.(13), Myotis \n\nspp. (13), Nyctalus spp. (26), Pipistrellus spp. (154) and unidentified calls (76).  \n\nP. pygmaeus, P. pipistrellus and E. serotinus/E. isabellinus stood out as the most \n\nfrequently recorded species, comprising a total of 91.2% of the calls identified to species \n\nlevel. These three species, along with N. lasiopterus/N. noctula, were recorded in all \n\nhabitat types. Of the 12 identified species, five were rarely recorded (B. barbastellus, M. \n\ndaubentonii, M. escalerai, P. kuhlii and P. auritus/P. austriacus), with less than 10 bat-\n\npasses each. \n\nWe found no significant differences in diversity, evenness and species richness between \n\nhabitat types. Mean values of diversity, evenness and richness for all habitats and \n\nseasons are presented in Table 3.2. Species composition analysis, assessed through a \n\none-way ANOSIM, revealed marginally non-significant differences between bat \n\nassemblages among the different habitat types (R=0.15; p=0.06). \n\n \n\nSpatial patterns of bat activity \n\n \n\nCluster analysis of the percentage of total activity per habitat type for the seven species \n\nwith more than 10 recorded passes (Figure 3.2) revealed three main clusters; one \n\ngrouping the edge-forager M. myotis/M. blythii and the open-space forager N. leisleri, a \n\nsecond one constituted only by T. teniotis, and a third one grouping P. pipistrellus, P. \n\npygmaeus, E. serotinus/E. isabellinus and N. lasiopterus/ N. noctula. \n\nA high percentage of the total activity of M. myotis/M. blythii and N. leisleri occurred in \n\nforests (40.0 and 38.5%, respectively) and reed beds (20.0 and 26.9%, respectively). T. \n\n\n\nA MOSAIC OF OPPORTUNITIES \n\n \n35 \n\nteniotis showed highest activity in uncluttered habitats (82.4% in rice fields, sea rushes \n\nand reed beds) and it was separated from another cluster containing the genera \n\nPipistrellus, Nyctalus and Eptesicus that occurred in all habitat types. Within this latter \n\ncluster of more generalist species in terms of habitat use, two sub-clusters were formed, \n\nwhich separated the Pipistrellus spp. from E. serotinus/E. isabellinus and N. lasiopterus/N. \n\nnoctula. Both P. pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus exhibited a high percentage of activity at \n\nurban sites (26.5 and 26.9%, respectively) and low activity in forest sites (only 5.3 and \n\n6.4%, respectively). Conversely, E. serotinus/E. isabellinus and N. lasiopterus/N. noctula \n\npresented higher levels of activity in forest sites (28.4 and 16.7%, respectively) and lower \n\nvalues at human settlements (17.2 and 8.3%, respectively) compared to Pipistrellus \n\nspecies. \n\nGLMM and multiple comparisons revealed little influence of habitat type on overall bat \n\nactivity, only showing that urban settings presented significantly more activity than \n\nmarshlands (z=3.03; p=0.05). \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \n\n36 \n\n \n\nTable 3.1 List of species recorded, and respective conservation status in Portugal (Cabral et al., 2005), and worldwide (IUCN, 2013).

The summaries of the models presenting best fit are presented in Table \n\n3.3. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \n\n38 \n\nThe analysis of activity per guild revealed that edge foragers were significantly more \n\nactive in urban areas, when compared to forest and marshlands (z=3.19, p=0.03 and \n\nz=3.50, p=0.01, respectively). However, once we repeated the analysis without P. \n\npygmaeus, we found no significant differences in the activity of this guild between \n\nhabitat types. Also, we found no significant differences between habitats in the activity \n\nof open-space foragers. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 Dendrogram resulting from the cluster analysis of percentage of habitat use, and \n\nrepresentation of the most used habitat types by each of the resulting clusters. \n\n \n\nHabitat type significantly influenced the activity of N. leisleri and P. pygmaeus. The \n\nactivity of N. leisleri was significantly higher in forest patches compared to rice fields or \n\nBocage (z=3.57; p<0.01). Nearly significant differences were also found for N. leisleri \n\nbetween forest sites and maize fields (z=2.83; p=0.08), and between sites of sea \n\nrushes and marshlands (z=2.78; p=0.10). P. pygmaeus had higher levels of activity in \n\nurban environments. Significant differences between this habitat and five others were \n\nfound for this species: marshlands (z=4.33; p<0.01), forest (z=4.03; p<0.01), sea \n\nrushes (z=3.43; p=0.01), reed beds (z=3.15; p=0.04) and maize fields (z=3.10; p=0.04). \n\n\n\nA MOSAIC OF OPPORTUNITIES \n\n \n\n39 \n\nThe remaining five species considered in this approach revealed no significant \n\ndifferences in activity amongst habitat types. The summary of the GLMM performed for \n\neach species is presented in Table 3.3. \n\n \n\nSeasonal patterns in bat assemblage structuring and activity \n\n \n\nSpecies richness and diversity were significantly higher in Spring compared to Autumn \n\n(z=3.20, p<0.01 and z=3.73, p<0.01, respectively). Evenness was significantly higher in \n\nSummer compared to Autumn (z=3.61, p<0.01). As expected, bat activity was greatly \n\nreduced during the Winter so this season was excluded from the analysis. \n\nOverall bat activity, feeding activity and social behaviour did not vary significantly \n\nbetween seasons. However, within seasons, significant differences were found in \n\noverall bat activity among the studied habitat types. During the Spring, higher activity \n\nlevels were recorded in urban, Bocage and maize field habitats. Significant differences \n\nwere found between urban sites and the remaining habitat types (all p&lt;0.01), with the \n\nexception of Bocage and maize fields. \n\nIn Summer, rice fields and urban sites presented significantly more activity than the \n\nother habitats (all p<0.01), but these two habitat types were not significantly different \n\nfrom each other in terms of this parameter. The least used habitat type was \n\nmarshlands, which revealed significantly less activity compared to forests (z=-3.32, \n\np=0.02), reed beds (z=-3.72, p<0.01), urban (z=-4.52, p<0.01) and rice fields (z=-6.61, \n\np<0.01). \n\nDuring Autumn, the highest levels of bat activity were registered in urban and Bocage \n\nsites, as occurred during Spring, but also on reed beds. We found significant \n\ndifferences in bat activity between urban sites and the remaining habitat types (all \n\np<0.01). Significant differences in bat activity were also found in Bocage and reed beds \n\nwhen compared to forest, marshlands, maize and rice fields (all p<0.01). Maize fields \n\nand marshlands presented the lowest bat activity levels, and also revealed less activity \n\nwhen compared to the sea rushes habitat (z=-3.53, p<0.01 and z=-4.66, p<0.01, \n\nrespectively). \n\nWe found significant differences between seasons in the activity of the open-space \n\nforagers. This guild showed higher levels of activity in Spring than Autumn (z=3.93, \n\np<0.01) and Summer (z=2.69, p=0.02). In contrast, the activity of edge foragers did not \n\nchange significantly across seasons. Regarding the species-specific temporal patterns, \n\nour results only revealed statistically significant differences in the activity of T. teniotis, \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \n\n40 \n\nwith higher levels of activity registered in Spring compared to Summer (z=2.75, p=0.02) \n\nand Autumn (z=2.76, p=0.02).

DISCUSSION \n\n \n\nBat assembly structuring across habitats and seasons \n\n \n\nWe found no significant differences in bat assemblage structure and composition \n\namong the different studied habitat types of the BVL landscape. This is in accordance \n\nwith other studies showing that bats explore different patches within a landscape, and \n\nthat fragmented, mosaic-shaped landscapes can still harbour several bat species (Law \n\nand Dickman, 1998; Bernard and Fenton, 2002, 2007). On the other hand, it might also \n\nsuggest the presence of one assemblage making use of several distinct habitat \n\npatches. This may be the case if chosen sampling sites are close to each other, since \n\nsome of the registered species have small home-ranges (e.g. P. pipistrellus and P. \n\npygmaeus \u2013 Nicholls and Racey, 2006; Myotis myotis \u2013 Drescher, 2004), but not if \n\nsampling sites are several kilometres apart. Frequent movements between roosting \n\nand foraging sites located far apart are only possible for species known to fly long \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \n\n42 \n\ndistances and to possess large home-ranges (e.g. N. leisleri \u2013 Shiel et al., 1999; T. \n\nteniotis \u2013 Marques et al., 2004). In any case, land cover does not seem to strongly \n\ninfluence the occurrence of a species in a certain site within the BVL landscape, \n\npossibly due to the generalist character of the studied species (four of the seven most \n\nrecorded species were registered in all sampled habitat types). We found significant \n\nvariation in bat diversity, richness and evenness throughout the study period, which \n\nmay be due to the temporal dynamics of resource distribution, such as prey and/or \n\nappropriate roost availability. \n\nWe found similar values of species richness and diversity in forest sites when \n\ncompared with the other studied habitats. However, evergreen woodlands, including \n\nEucalyptus stands (which comprised the majority of our forest sites), are often \n\nassociated with lower animal diversity and species richness, both in bats (Russo and \n\nJones, 2003; Matos, 2011) and other taxa (Marsden et al., 2001; Zahn et al., 2009). \n\nThe importance of broadleaved woodlands for several European bat species as \n\nforaging (Walsh and Harris, 1996; Russ and Montgomery, 2002; Rainho, 2007; Sattler \n\net al., 2007) and roosting habitats (Russo et al., 2004; Dietz et al., 2009; Boughey et \n\nal., 2011) is well known. However, evergreen woodlands, especially well-developed \n\nstands, may increase in importance when broadleaved woodlands are absent. Also, we \n\nexpected species richness and diversity to be lower in urban sites, since only the most \n\nubiquitous species often forage in these areas (Rydell, 1992). Although six of the \n\ntwelve recorded species were not observed in urban sites during this study, the values \n\nof diversity and species richness did not differ significantly from those of other habitat \n\ntypes; although this may be due to a lack of statistical power. \n\n \n\nSpatial and seasonal patterns of activity \n\n \n\nOverall, we found few differences in the activity patterns of the different bat species \n\nacross habitats. We found a positive influence of urban sites on the activity of P. \n\npygmaeus, which is not unusual for this species (Rainho, 2007; Pocora and Pocora, \n\n2011). However, these bats are also usually found foraging in riparian sites (Vaughan \n\net al., 1997; Russo and Jones, 2003; Davidson-Watts et al., 2006; Lundy and \n\nMontgomery, 2010), deciduous woodland (Glendell and Vaughan, 2002; Pocora and \n\nPocora, 2011), woodland edges and other linear features such as hedgerows and tree \n\nlines (Glendell and Vaughan, 2002; Brandt et al., 2007). Other species of the genus \n\nPipistrellus such as P. kuhlii and P. pipistrellus are known to forage in a wide range of \n\nhabitat types and often feed around streetlamps (Blake et al., 1994; Carmel and Safriel, \n\n\n\nA MOSAIC OF OPPORTUNITIES \n\n \n\n43 \n\n1998; Russo and Jones, 2003) but P. pygmaeus, by comparison, seems to be more of \n\na specialised and selective species (Davidson-Watts et al., 2006). The proximity of \n\nhuman settlements to wetlands and riparian habitats in the BVL landscape may provide \n\nP. pygmaeus with additional suitable foraging habitats, particularly surrounding \n\nstreetlights in human settlements where high densities of prey may occur (Gaisler et \n\nal., 1998; Rydell, 1992; Avila-Flores and Fenton, 2005). Our cluster analysis also \n\nrevealed a positive tendency for more activity of both P. pygmaeus and P. pipistrellus \n\nin Bocage. The dense network of linear structures such as live fences found in this \n\nhabitat type may provide optimal foraging sites and commuting routes for these \n\nspecies, as well as protection against predators and adverse weather conditions \n\n(Verboom and Huitema, 1997). These hedgerows, together with the numerous \n\nfreshwater sources available in this habitat, also provide favourable conditions for \n\nmany insect species (Harvey et al., 2005; Verboom and Huitema, 1997), thereby \n\nincreasing their abundance and, presumably, their availability to bats. Indeed, the short \n\nwingspan and manoeuvrable flight of Pipistrellus, as well as the FM and QCF \n\ncomponents of their search calls, enables them to forage close to vegetation in \n\nbackground-cluttered spaces (Schnitzler and Kalko, 2001), ultimately giving them an \n\nadvantage in exploiting such habitat. \n\nWe also found a positive relation between forests and the activity of N. leisleri. \n\nAlthough woodland habitats or their edge structures are regarded as some of the \n\npreferred roosting and foraging habitats of this species (Dietz et al., 2009), some \n\nstudies have demonstrated that N. leisleri often exhibits no habitat preferences, \n\nreflecting a somewhat generalist choice of foraging habitats (Russ and Montgomery, \n\n2002; Lundy and Montgomery, 2010). Also, Shiel and Fairley (1998) and Pocora and \n\nPocora (2011) found higher levels of activity of this species in human settlements, \n\nparticularly along roads and streetlamps. In this study, N. leisleri occurred in six of the \n\neight studied habitats; though we cannot be sure whether the bats were foraging or just \n\ncommuting. Through hierarchical clustering, some similarities were found between N. \n\nleisleri and M. myotis/M. blythii regarding percentage of habitat use (see Fig 2). \n\nBecause M. myotis forages on the ground (Audet, 1990) and N. leisleri often forages \n\nover the canopy (Dietz et al., 2009), they are likely to explore different space and prey \n\nresources in similar habitat types. \n\nWe found a positive influence of urban sites on overall bat activity, feeding activity and \n\nsocial behaviour, as well as in the activity of the edge-foragers guild. However, this bias \n\ntowards urban environments is undoubtedly linked to the activity of P. pygmaeus, \n\nalready described above. Despite that no differences were found between habitat types \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \n\n44 \n\nfor the activity of the open-space foragers guild, we found some similarities in the \n\npercentage of habitat use between E. serotinus/E. isabellinus and N. lasiopterus/N. \n\nnoctula through the cluster analysis. Furthermore, this analysis confirmed the \n\npreference of T. teniotis for open-space, uncluttered habitats since this species almost \n\nexclusively used this type of setting and, particularly, rice fields, sea rushes and reed \n\nbeds. \n\nBat activity in the different habitat types varied throughout the study period. Since some \n\ninsect prey is known to be more abundant during short periodic bursts of time (in a \n\nprocess called swarming) that can occur at different times of the year in distinct habitat \n\ntypes (de Jong and Ahl\u00e9n, 1991), our results may reflect the response of bats to these \n\nshifts in prey availability (Robinson and Stebbings, 1997), as well as to the \n\ncharacteristic temporal heterogeneity of human-altered landscapes (DeCleck et al., \n\n2010).  \n\nThe higher activity of the open-space foragers guild and of T. teniotis in Spring may be \n\nexplained by post-hibernation restoration of fat reserves (Ciechanowski et al., 2010). \n\nHowever, since pregnancy and lactation occur during summer, bat activity was \n\nexpected to be higher in this season due to the increased energy demands of these \n\nlife-cycle stages (Kunz, 1973; Encarna\u00e7\u00e3o and Dietz, 2006). However, the lower \n\nactivity during the summer observed in this study might be explained by the fact that \n\nbat detectability was lower during this season due to significant noise disturbance \n\nproduced by katydids. This is especially relevant for species with low-frequency calls, \n\nsuch as T. teniotis and those of the genus Nyctalus, since katydid song is usually \n\nemitted between 600Hz and 20kHz (del Castillo and Gwynne, 2007), corresponding \n\npartially or completely to the frequency intervals of their echolocation calls. The lower \n\nactivity registered during the autumn might reflect bat dispersal to distant winter \n\nhibernacula. \n\n \n\nHeterogeneous landscape matrices as mosaics of opportunities \n\n \n\nSince few differences were found amongst the habitat types studied, two main \n\nscenarios can be considered: 1) landscape matrices can be regarded as mosaics of \n\nopportunities, enabling bats to exploit vital resources in distinct patches; 2) \n\nopportunities are scarce in fragmented landscapes, forcing bats to exploit less optimal \n\nhabitats and resources.  \n\nFor the first scenario, we attribute the lack of differences to the generalist character of \n\nsome of the recorded species (e.g. E. serotinus \u2013 Rainho, 2007; N. leisleri \u2013 Lundy and \n\n\n\nA MOSAIC OF OPPORTUNITIES \n\n \n\n45 \n\nMontgomery, 2010; P. pipistrellus \u2013 Russo and Jones, 2003), and to a response by \n\nbats to temporal and spatial variation in resource availability. The response of bats to \n\nchanges in resource availability, particularly to prey availability, has been described for \n\nsome species such as E. serotinus (Robinson and Stebbings, 1997) and Pipistrellus \n\nspecies (Kusch and Idelberger, 2005). In fact, changes in food supply are considered \n\nto be one of the key factors behind seasonal changes in bat activity (Bartonicka and \n\nZukal, 2003; Meyer et al., 2004; Ramos Pereira et al., 2010). Therefore, the observed \n\nfluctuation in use of foraging sites during the year can be interpreted as an exploitation \n\nof insect concentrations, rather than a consistent use of particular habitats (Swift et al., \n\n1985; Furlonger et al., 1987; Kusch and Idelberger, 2005). Bats usually require a mixed \n\nlandscape in which adequate foraging, roosting and drinking sites can be found \n\n(Lookingbill et al., 2010). These vital habitats and resources are frequently widely \n\nscattered within the landscape. However, many species of bats are highly vagile and \n\nmove readily within the landscape matrix to take advantage of the different available \n\npatches (Medina et al., 2007; Rainho and Palmeirim, 2011). Thus, combining the \n\ntemporal and spatial variation of resource availability, the mobility of bats, their need for \n\ndifferent habitats within a landscape, and the opportunistic character of most species, \n\nwe assume that bats interpret the BVL landscape matrix as a whole, rather than \n\nselecting or exploiting the different habitat types individually. In this way, the \n\nheterogeneous landscape that characterizes the BVL region provides a mosaic of \n\nopportunities for bats, which freely exploit the resources across different land cover \n\nsettings and according to their temporal variation. This is consistent with other studies \n\nthat revealed that fragmented landscapes can still harbour high bat species richness \n\nand abundance, and that bats exploit the different settings present in the landscape \n\n(Bernard and Fenton, 2002; Estrada and Coates-Estrada, 2002; Gorresen and Willig, \n\n2004; Bernard and Fenton, 2007). \n\nThe second scenario presents a more pessimistic view of the interaction between bats \n\nand the heterogeneous landscape. There are several known negative effects of \n\nfragmentation on animal species (e.g. Saunders et al., 1991). The intensification of \n\nagriculture (Wickramasinghe et al., 2003), pesticide use (Racey and Entwistle, 2003) \n\nand transformation of natural habitats into monocultures (Lacki et al., 2007) are also \n\nknow to negatively influence bat diversity and populations. Since the BVL landscape is \n\ncomposed of a mosaic of natural and human-altered habitats, with significant coverage \n\nby agricultural fields (intensive and extensive) and forest monocultures, those negative \n\neffects are probably present. Since resource availability directly influences the \n\ndevelopment and maintenance of individuals and populations, anthropogenic changes \n\nthat alter their abundance and distribution in space and time can have considerable \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \n\n46 \n\nnegative impacts on animal communities (Bradbury et al., 2001). Furthermore, human \n\nalterations of natural ecosystems may reduce the availability of optimal habitats, forcing \n\nsome organisms to explore sub-optimal patches to which they might not be well-\n\nadapted (Lambrechts et al., 2004). If that is the case in our study area, the scarcity of \n\nresources may be forcing bats to exploit the several habitat types that shape the \n\nlandscape, regardless of their particular setting. This would explain the similar \n\nassemblages found over the different habitats, as well as the lack of differences found \n\nin the activity of guilds and species amongst them.  \n\nDespite the fact that both scenarios could explain our findings, we believe that the \n\nparticular case of the BVL landscape is closer to the first one, at least for some of the \n\nrecorded bat species. Although some of the above-mentioned negative effects of \n\nhuman activities are probably affecting bat communities, it seems plausible that several \n\nof the bat species recorded, particularly the more opportunistic ones, still have an \n\nadequate mosaic of habitats where foraging and roosting sites can be found. Since \n\nlarge wetland and riparian areas, closely located to other habitats, characterize the \n\nBVL landscape, we believe that bats exploit the landscape as a whole, taking \n\nadvantage of the resources available in different areas at different times of the year. \n\nNevertheless, this may not be true for some of the species found in this study. The loss \n\nof important habitats, such as broadleaved woodland that has been transformed into \n\nagricultural land and evergreen forest monocultures, may negatively influence the strict \n\nforest-dwelling species, namely B. barbastellus and Plecotus spp., which were rarely \n\nrecorded during this study. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 4 \n\n \n\nBAT RICHNESS AND ACTIVITY IN HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPES: \n\nGUILD-SPECIFIC AND SCALE-DEPENDENT? \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n49 \n\n4.

ABSTRACT \n\n \n\nThe conversion of natural environments into agricultural land has profound effects on \n\nthe composition of the landscape, often resulting in  a mosaic of crop fields, pastures \n\nand remnant patches of natural vegetation. Although an increase in structural \n\ncomplexity of a habitat mosaic may improve the availability of ecological niches for \n\nanimals, potentially increasing species diversity, the responses of organisms to these \n\nchanges will be species-specific and scale-dependent. Bats are highly vagile, and their \n\ndaily and seasonal resource needs often require the use of distinct habitats. \n\nFurthermore, the way they select a habitat is an aggregative response to both \n\nlandscape and local features. We sampled bats acoustically, while simultaneously \n\nsampling insects with light traps, across 24 sampling sites within a heterogeneous \n\nlandscape in Portugal, constituted by a mosaic of natural, semi-natural and human-\n\naltered terrestrial and freshwater and brackish habitats. We then assessed the \n\nrelationships between total bat activity, activity of distinct guilds, and species richness, \n\nwith landscape and local features, across four distinct focal scales. Our results \n\nrevealed both scale- and guild-dependent responses of bats to landscape and local \n\nfeatures. At broader scales we found positive associations between open-space \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 \n\n \n\n50 \n\nforaging bats and habitat heterogeneity and, as expected, between edge-space \n\nforaging bats and greater edge lengths. At smaller scales, forest cover and water \n\navailability (for open-space foragers) and Bocage cover (for edge foragers) were the \n\nmost efficient predictors. Locally, bat activity was strongly associated with weather \n\nconditions and insect abundance. Globally, our results suggest that bats are sensitive \n\nto local resource availability and distribution, while simultaneously reacting to broader \n\nlandscape features. Also, our results suggest that forest and Bocage habitats are \n\npotential keystone structures for bats within this heterogeneous landscape. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2. INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nLand use change happens through both natural and anthropogenic processes. \n\nHowever, human actions are responsible for unprecedented and profound \n\nmodifications on ecological systems worldwide (Lambin et al., 2001). In Europe there \n\nare hardly any landscapes that are not under any type of human influence (Meeus, \n\n1995), and farmland nowadays represents the majority of the land cover in the \n\nEuropean territory (Robinson and Sutherland, 2002, Billeter et al., 2008).  \n\nOne of the most frequent changes is the conversion of natural habitats into agricultural \n\nland. The result is often the fragmentation of natural habitats (Haila, 2000) by the \n\nimmersion of those remnant natural patches in a human-managed, agricultural matrix \n\n(Uematsu et al., 2010; Fuentes-Montemayor et al., 2013). Indeed, in Europe, \n\nagricultural landscapes are usually composed by a mosaic of crop fields, pastures and \n\nnatural remnant patches, creating a landscape of high spatial (Duchamp and Swihart, \n\n2008) and temporal heterogeneity dictated by human activities and land management \n\n(Di Giulio et al. 2001; DeClerck et al. 2010; Gilroy et al. 2010). The increase in \n\nagriculture intensity and land abandonment are some of the main causes for \n\nbiodiversity loss worldwide (Meeus, 1995; Lambin et al., 2001; Robinson and \n\nSutherland, 2002; Uematsu et al., 2010), but low-intensive land-use systems may \n\nactually be positive for biodiversity conservation (Tscharntke et al., 2005).  \n\nThe \u201chabitat heterogeneity hypothesis\u201d assumes that an increase in structural \n\ncomplexity of a habitat mosaic leads to the availability of more ecological niches, and \n\npromotes several distinct opportunities for resource exploitation, resulting in greater \n\nspecies diversity (Bazzaz, 1975; Tews et al., 2004). Still, spatial heterogeneity affects \n\nthe dispersal patterns of organisms, as well as their foraging behaviour (Johnson et al., \n\n1992), since resource availability may vary in different regions of the landscape, \n\naltering their suitability to the organism (Milne et al., 1989). However, the response of \n\n\n\nBATS IN HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPES \n\n \n\n51 \n\nan organism to spatial heterogeneity depends strongly on its taxonomic group, its \n\ndispersion abilities, and its perception of the surrounding habitat (Kotliar and Wiens, \n\n1990; Malanson and Cramer, 1999; Tews et al., 2004). This response is also scale-\n\ndependent, since a heterogeneous landscape likely to be easily explored by an \n\norganism might be impossible to exploit by another (Milne et al., 1989) due to eco-\n\nmorphological restraints. \n\nBats are highly vagile, and many species depend on multiple habitats to fulfil their daily \n\nand seasonal needs, especially to deal with different requirements along the various \n\nstages of their life-cycle (Law and Dickman, 1998; Lookingbill et al., 2010). The \n\nprocess of habitat selection, i.e. their presence and use of a certain site within a \n\nlandscape, results from a set of decisions at both the landscape and local scales (Ford \n\net al., 2006). On a wider scale, bats are thought to respond to landscape configuration \n\n(e.g. patchiness, habitat diversity, land cover proportions), roost availability, proximity \n\nto adequate foraging sites and water sources, climatic conditions and anthropogenic \n\ndisturbance (Furlonger et al., 1987; Gehrt and Chelsvig, 2003; Evelyn et al., 2004; Ford \n\net al., 2006; Johnson et al., 2008, Rainho et al., 2010). Locally, vegetation structure, \n\neco-morphological traits and prey availability seem to be some of the most influential \n\nfactors (Aldridge and Rautenbach, 1987; Ford et al., 2005, 2006; Johnson et al., 2008). \n\nFurthermore, bats also exhibit strong seasonal dynamics in activity and habitat use; \n\nthis usually reflects the weather conditions, (e.g. winter survival or hibernation), the \n\ndirectly or indirectly related changes in prey availability, and the stage of the lif e-cycle \n\n(Bartonicka and Zukal, 2003; Meyer et al., 2004; Ciechanowski et al., 2010; Wang et \n\nal., 2010),  \n\nSeveral studies have looked into the interaction between bats and the features of the \n\nlandscape they inhabit, but they have mainly focused forested areas (e.g. Yates and \n\nMuzika, 2006; Perry et al., 2008), particularly in the tropics (e.g. Gorresen and Willig, \n\n2004; Gorresen et al., 2005; Pinto and Keitt, 2008; Klingbeil and Willig, 2009). Though \n\nsome studies have recently looked into the responses of bats to landscape features in \n\npredominantly agricultural landscapes in temperate regions (e.g. Duchamp and \n\nSwihart, 2008; Popa-Lisseanu et al., 2009; Ethier and Fahrig, 2011; Fuentes-\n\nMontemayor et al., 2011, 2013; Rainho and Palmeirim, 2013) there are still important \n\ngaps concerning the knowledge of the patterns of bat occurrence in those landscapes \n\nand, most importantly, of the processes behind those patterns. Fuentes-Montemayor et \n\nal. (2011) and Duchamp and Swihart (2008) found a positive influence of the amount of \n\nforest cover on bat abundance, reinforcing the importance of woodland patches in \n\nlandscapes where this habitat type is scarce. However, in both studies the response \n\ndiffered between species, according to their mobility and roosting preferences. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 \n\n \n\n52 \n\nFuentes-Montemayor et al. (2013) and Rainho and Palmeirim (2013) also found \n\nspecies-specific responses to landscape features on multispecies colonies, mainly \n\ndriven by their degree of habitat specialization. Ethier and Fahrig (2011) found a \n\npositive influence of fragmentation on bat abundance, stating that landscape \n\ncomplementation is the main mechanism supporting that relationship. On the other \n\nhand, the results obtained by Popa-Lisseanu et al. (2009) showed a negative influence \n\nof habitat fragmentation on the populations of Nyctalus lasiopterus due to the increase \n\nof the distances between adequate roosting and foraging habitats (i.e. low landscape \n\ncomplementation, Dunning et al., 1992).  \n\nIn this study, we aim to investigate the relation between bat activity and species \n\nrichness and the heterogeneous landscape of Baixo Vouga Lagunar, Central-West \n\nPortugal, through a multi-scale approach. Specifically, we aim to i) identify the \n\nlandscape and local features that better explain bat activity and richness within the \n\nstudy area; ii) investigate if the response given by bat activity and richness to \n\nlandscape characteristics varies across a gradient of focal scales; and iii) investigate \n\nhow different bat guilds respond to landscape and local features. \n\nWith this we expect to be able to understand factors affecting bat activity and richness \n\nwithin the Baixo Vouga Lagunar matrix, so that future research, conservation and land \n\nmanagement plans may be supported on solid bases. Furthermore, we expect that the \n\nknowledge acquired with this study may also help in the interpretation of the \n\nrelationship between bats and human-altered, heterogeneous landscapes elsewhere. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3. MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n \n\nStudy area \n\n \n\nThe study area has an area of approximately 50,000 ha, and is located in the Aveiro \n\ndistrict, on the Central-North Portuguese coast (Figure 4.1). It harbours the \n\nmunicipalities of Albergaria-a-Velha, Aveiro, Estarreja, \u00cdlhavo, Murtosa, Oliveira de \n\nAzem\u00e9is and Ovar (40\u00ba39-52\u2019N, 8\u00ba27-45\u2019W), encompassing the Baixo Vouga Lagunar \n\n(BVL), as well as its surroundings. Hereafter we refer to our study area as BVL, \n\nalthough it encompasses a significant extension of its surroundings. The landscape is \n\ncharacterized by a heterogeneous landscape, with a mosaic of natural, semi-natural \n\nand human-altered habitats. The natural habitats include aquatic and terrestrial \n\n\n\nBATS IN HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPES \n\n \n\n53 \n\nenvironments, in particular the Ria de Aveiro, an estuarine coastal lagoon. Over 34% of \n\nthe area is occupied by agricultural land, both traditional and intensive. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 Approximate location of the study area in the Iberian Peninsula, main land use \n\ncharacterization, and example of a sampling site and respective buffers of 1.5 km, 3 km and 6 \n\nkm, used for landscape analysis. \n\n \n\nThe traditional form of agriculture is represented by the Bocage, which is a unique \n\nman-made habitat, characterized by small areas of crops and pastures, intersected by \n\nsmall freshwater courses and live fences of autochthonous trees (e.g. Alnus glutinosa, \n\nSalix atrocinerea, Quercus robur), shrub and herb hedgerows (e.g. Hedera spp., Rubus \n\nLegend\n\nWater\n\nUrban\n\nArea without vegetation\n\nAgricultural\n\nWetland habitats\n\nBocage\n\nWoodland\n\n1.3\n\nRice field\n\nFallow land, pasture\n\n1.4\n\n2.2\n\n1.2\n\n3.2\n\n3.4\n\nReed bed\n\nSea rushes\n\n5.2\n\nLegend\n\nWater\n\nUrban\n\nArea without vegetation\n\nAgricultural\n\nWetland habitats\n\nBocage\n\nWoodland\n\n1.3\n\nRice field\n\nFallow land, pasture\n\n1.4\n\n2.2\n\n1.2\n\n3.2\n\n3.4\n\nReed bed\n\nSea rushes\n\n5.2\n\nLegend\n\nWater\n\nUrban\n\nArea without vegetation\n\nAgricultural\n\nWetland habitats\n\nBocage\n\nWoodland\n\n1.3\n\nRice field\n\nFallow land, pasture\n\n1.4\n\n2.2\n\n1.2\n\n3.2\n\n3.4\n\nReed bed\n\nSea rushes\n\n5.2\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 \n\n \n\n54 \n\nspp.). In Portugal, this type of agricultural practice is limited to the BVL region, and \n\notherwise in Europe only to southern France and northern England (Brito et al., 2010). \n\nThe remaining agricultural lands are dedicated, to a small extent, to rice (Oryza sp.) \n\nproduction, and to a greater extent and more intensively, to maize (Zea mays) cultures. \n\nWoodlands are fragmented, and mostly composed by production, non-deciduous tree \n\nspecies, mainly Eucalyptus globulus, but also Pinus pinaster). Several villages, as well \n\nas numerous industries can be found both within and in the outskirts of BVL. \n\nThis region is a transition zone between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean climates, \n\nwith a strong influence from the Atlantic Ocean (Costa et al., 1998; Bonmat\u00ed et al., \n\n2006). During the study period (October 2011 - September 2012), mean air \n\ntemperature was 14.5 \u00baC (oscillating between 8.5 \u00baC in February and 19.8 \u00baC in \n\nSeptember), and mean annual humidity of 76.5% (data from CUF weather station). \n\nAccumulated precipitation varied between 5.6 mm in July and 194 mm in November, \n\nwith an annual value of 627.6 mm (data from CESAMET).  \n\n \n\nBat sampling, identification and definition of eco-morphological guilds \n\n \n\nWe sampled bats acoustically through 15-minute walking surveys, of approximately \n\n500 m, performed at a regular pace. Sampling was carried out on a total of 24 sites, \n\ndivided in three replicates of eight habitat types characteristic of the BVL landscape: \n\nBocage, forest, maize fields, marshlands, reed beds, rice fields, sea rushes and urban. \n\nWe sampled each site twice a month, so that the variation between nights and sites \n\ncould be taken into account (Broders, 2003; Wickramasinghe et al., 2003; Ford et al., \n\n2005). No sampling was performed on nights with unfavourable weather conditions \n\nsuch as rain or strong winds, since these are known to negatively influence bat activity \n\n(Ford et al., 2005, 2006) and detectability (Dixon, 2012). During April and July, there \n\nwere adverse weather conditions, thus we were only able to sample once on each of \n\nthese months. \n\nWe performed the walking surveys within the first 2.5h-3h after dusk, when bat activity \n\nlevels are highest (Rydell et al., 1996; Hayes, 1997), using a Pettersson D240x ultra-\n\nsound detector (Pettersson Elektronik AB\nTM\n\n, Uppsala, Sweden) in heterodyne mode. \n\nTo maximize the chance of detecting different bat species, we travelled at a constant \n\nand fast pace through the full range of frequencies (Russ and Montgomery, 2002). A \n\ndigital recorder (Edirol R-09, Roland Corp., Shizuoka, Japan) was used to storage the \n\n1.7 seconds sample calls. For every transect, we registered air temperature, relative \n\nhumidity, atmospheric pressure and wind velocity using a Kestrel 4000 hand-held \n\nweather station (Kestrel Meters\nTM\n\n, Birmingham, Michigan).  \n\n\n\nBATS IN HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPES \n\n \n\n55 \n\nWe analysed bat calls with Audacity 1.3.13 software (http://audacity.sourceforge.net), \n\nand registered several parameters: call duration, inter-pulse interval, start and end \n\nfrequencies and peak frequency (frequency containing most energy). Whenever \n\npossible, we identified calls to the species level, using a reference collection of bat calls \n\nand dichotomous keys for Portuguese (Rainho et al., 2011) and Iberian (Lis\u00f3n, 2011) \n\nbats. We then divided bat species into three guilds, based on eco-morphological traits \n\n(Fenton, 1990; Schnitzler and Kalko, 2001): \n\ni) Open-space foragers \u2013 Species that emit long, narrowband and low-frequency \n\ncalls, and are characterized by a fast and energetically inexpensive flight, with high \n\nwing loading and aspect ratio. Species included in this guild were Nyctalus spp., \n\nEptesicus spp. and Tadarida teniotis; \n\nii) Edge-foragers \u2013 Species that echolocate through short pulses often composed \n\nof both broad and narrowband components, that present a slow and energetically \n\ninexpensive flight type, and average wing loading and aspect ratio. Species included in \n\nthis guild were Barbastella barbastellus, Myotis spp. and Pipistrellus spp.; \n\niii) Closed-habitat foragers (CHF) \u2013 Species with low-intensity, broadband \n\necholocation calls, characterized by low wing loadings and aspect ratio, and that \n\npresent a very manoeuvrable, but energetically expensive flight. Species classified as \n\nclosed-habitat foragers were those of the genus Plecotus. \n\n \n\nInsect sampling \n\n \n\nInsects were sampled using light traps, on the same sites where bat surveys were \n\nperformed. The place where traps were set up was selected so that a compromise \n\nbetween the representativeness of the sampled habitat type and trap protection against \n\ntheft and destruction was achieved. Placement sites where kept constant throughout \n\nthe study period. Traps contained a tubular fluorescent actinic light (8W), frequently \n\nused to attract and capture insects (e.g. Sutton and Hudson, 1980; Birkinshaw and \n\nThomas, 1999; Davis et al., 2011). We set the traps in the field before nightfall, prior to \n\nthe walking surveys, within the path of the walking transects, and those were on for \n\napproximately two hours. Insect and bat sampling occurred simultaneously, but due to \n\nlight traps\u2019 theft, component malfunction or adverse weather conditions, the two \n\nmonthly samples were not always possible. Captured insects were collected and stored \n\nin 70% ethanol for posterior identification in the laboratory. All insect sampling was \n\ncarried out under the licenses number 385 / 2011/ CAPT and 99 / 2012 / CAPT (ICNF, \n\nInstituto da Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o da Natureza e das Florestas). We identified the arthropods to \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 \n\n \n\n56 \n\nthe order level, using appropriate literature and dichotomous keys (e.g. Barrientos, \n\n1988; Chinery, 2007; Capinera, 2008), and total abundance was registered for each \n\norder and site. \n\n \n\nLandscape predictors \n\n \n\nWe used ArcGIS 10.0 to create buffers of 1.5, 3 and 6 km radii around the mid-point of \n\neach transect. The different scales used intend to cover the known home ranges of the \n\ndetected species, with low (e.g. P. pygmaeus, Nicholls and Racey, 2006), intermediate \n\n(e.g. M. myotis, Drescher, 2004), and high (e.g. N. leisleri, Shiel and Farley, 1999; T. \n\nteniotis, Marques et al., 2004) mobility. We used data from COS2007 (IGP, 2010) to \n\nclassify the landscape into land cover types, and updated it so that it could include \n\nrecent modifications, verified by us during dedicated field incursions and satellite \n\nimagery. For every buffer we calculated the percentage of each land cover class, and \n\ncategorize them into six types: i) rice fields; ii) Bocage; iii) forest; iv) maize fields; v) \n\nwetland habitats (joint percentage of reed beds, sea rushes and marshlands); and vi) \n\nhuman (joint percentage of urban and industrial areas). Using ArcGIS, we also \n\nwithdrew values of total edge (i.e. total length of the boundaries between adjacent \n\npatches of different land cover types) and watercourse lengths. We used Fragstats 4.1 \n\n(McGarigal et al., 2012) and selected and calculated four landscape metrics: i) patch \n\ndensity (PD: number of patches per 100 ha); ii) Shannon diversity index (SHDI: \n\nlandscape heterogeneity index); iii) area-weighted mean patch shape index \n\n(SHAPE_AM: measure of patch shape complexity, taking into account patch areas); \n\nand iv) contagion (CONTAG: index of landscape connectivity \u2013 considers both the \n\ndispersion and interspersion of patch types). The abovementioned variables (Table \n\n4.1) were chosen so that both landscape composition (e.g. land cover type proportions, \n\nwatercourse length) and physiognomy (e.g. patch density, landscape connectivity) \n\ncould be assessed (Dunning et al., 1992). \n\n \n\nLocal predictors \n\n \n\nWe used as local independent variables a set of weather, food availability, and habitat \n\nrelated predictors (Table 4.1). Weather predictors included air temperature and relative \n\nhumidity, atmospheric pressure and wind velocity. Food availability predictors included \n\nthe total number of insects captured, and the total number of individuals belonging to \n\nthe orders Diptera, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Himenoptera and Hemiptera. We chose \n\nthese orders because they were the most common in the captures and due to their \n\n\n\nBATS IN HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPES \n\n \n\n57 \n\ndocumented importance to the diet of insectivorous bats, particularly concerning the \n\nspecies recorded in this study (e.g. Swift et al., 1985; Waters et al., 1995; Vaughan, \n\n1997; Ramos Pereira et al., 2002; Kervyn and Libois, 2008; Dietz et al., 2009; Fuentes-\n\nMontemayor et al., 2013). Habitat type and the normalized difference vegetation index \n\n(NDVI) of each site were also considered as independent variables at the local scale. \n\n \n\nTable 4.1 Classes of predictors, and predictors used to explain bat activity and species richness \n\nacross three landscape scales (6 km, 3 km and 1.5 km) and at the local scale.  \n\nPredictor Class Predictor Landscape Local \n\nFood availability Coleoptera  ? \n\n Diptera  ? \n\n Hemiptera  ? \n\n Himenoptera  ? \n\n Lepidoptera  ? \n\n Total Insects  ? \n\nLandscape composition Bocage (%) ?  \n\n Forest (%) ?  \n\n Human (%) ?  \n\n Maize field (%) ?  \n\n Rice field (%) ?  \n\n Wetland habitats (%) ?  \n\n SHDI  ?  \n\n Watercourse length ?  \n\nLandscape physiognomy PD ?  \n\n SHAPE_AM ?  \n\n CONTAG ?  \n\n Total edge ?  \n\nHabitat  Habitat type  ? \n\n NDVI  ? \n\nWeather Air temperature  ? \n\n Atmospheric pressure  ? \n\n Relative humidity  ? \n\n Wind velocity  ? \n\n \n\nStatistical analysis \n\n \n\nAll statistical analysis were performed with software R, version 2.15.1 (R Core Team \n\n2013), using the hier.part and lme4 packages. We used a hierarchical partitioning \n\nanalysis (HPA, Chevan and Sutherland, 1991; McNally, 1996) to evaluate the \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 \n\n \n\n58 \n\nindependent contribution of the 12 variables at the landscape and 12 variables at the \n\nlocal level to explain the variation of total bat activity, guild activity, and species \n\nrichness. According to Olea et al. (2010), the HPA performed in the hier.part package \n\nfor more than nine independent variables produces a considerable inconsistency, as \n\nthe entering order of the variables affects their ranking. To avoid this bias (the \n\nprobability of a variable changing its position), we performed the analysis with 100 \n\nrepetitions, with different entering orders of the explanatory variables, as suggested by \n\nOlea et al. (2010). The models were fit to data by the least-squares method (i.e. \n\ngoodness-of-fit measures calculated by R-squared). We then ranked the variables and \n\nselected the ones that presented the highest independent contribution towards the \n\nvariation of each of the four response variables. For each response variable, a set of \n\nnine independent variables was chosen, since it was verified that, for this number and \n\nless, the ranking does not change with different entering orders (Olea et al., 2010). \n\nThen a randomization test (function \u201crand.hp\u201d) was done with 100 randomizations, to \n\nassess the significance of each variable in explaining the variation of the four response \n\nvariables. We then created a subset composed by the potential predictors that returned \n\nsignificant after this approach, for each response variable, and performed generalized \n\nlinear models (GLM) for the landscape datasets (since the number of levels for the \n\nrandom effects \u2013 replicate - was equal to the number of observations), and generalized \n\nlinear mixed models (GLMM) for the local dataset, to identify which of variables best \n\npredicted bat activity (total bat and guild activity) and species richness at each scale. \n\nModel selection was performed using Akaike\u2019s Information Criterion (AIC).  \n\nBased on the results obtained both in HPA and model selection, we classified the \n\nrelationships between response and explanatory variables similarly to Avila-Cabadilla \n\net al. (2012). Three types of relationship are defined: i) robust: when a significant \n\ninfluence (significance level set at p?0.05) was verified between the dependent and \n\nindependent variables in the HPA, and the explanatory variable was selected as one of \n\nthe best predictors in the models; ii) those denoting a tendency: when an explanatory \n\nvariable explains a great amount of the variation of the response variable, but no \n\nsignificant relationship was found between them in the HPA, and it was selected as \n\npart of the best-fitted models; and iii) no relationship: when no significant or near \n\nsignificant relationship was found between response and explanatory variables in the \n\nHPA, and the explanatory variable was not selected in the best models. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nBATS IN HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPES \n\n \n\n59 \n\n4.4. RESULTS \n\n \n\nBat diversity \n \n\nThrough the total 1544 bat calls recorded during this study, we identified 12 species (or \n\ntwo-species complexes): Barbastella barbastellus, Eptesicus serotinus/E. isabellinus, \n\nMyotis daubentonii, M. escalerai, M. myotis/M. blythii, Nyctalus lasiopterus/N. noctula, \n\nN. leisleri, Pipistrellus kuhlii, P. pipistrellus, P. pygmaeus, Plecotus auritus/P. \n\naustriacus and Tadarida teniotis (Table 4.2). We were able to classify 1468 (95.1%) \n\ncalls as belonging to species of the three guilds abovementioned. 245 calls (15.9%) \n\nwere attributed to the open-space foragers, and 1222 (79.1%) to the edge foraging \n\nguild (Table 4.2). Since only one call was recorded for the closed-habitat foragers (P. \n\nauritus/P. austriacus), we excluded this guild from further analyses.  \n\n \n\nInsect abundance \n \n\nA total of 40432 insects were captured, belonging to the orders Diptera, Himenoptera, \n\nLepidoptera, Coleoptera, Dictyoptera, Hemiptera, Orthoptera, Embioptera, Neuroptera, \n\nTrichoptera, Psocoptera, Odonata and Dermaptera. The most frequent orders were \n\nHemiptera (24895 individuals; 61.6%), Coleoptera (7188; 17.8%), Diptera (5361; \n\n13.3%), Lepidoptera (2200; 5.4%) and Himenoptera (675; 1.7%). These five orders \n\nwere selected as explanatory variables for the 12-variable dataset used in the HPA.  \n\n \n\nRelation between bat activity and landscape and local variables \n \n\nBased on HPA results and model selection (Table 4.3 and Table 4.4, respectively), we \n\nfound that total bat activity tended to be associated with different landscape predictors, \n\nat the different scales approached. At the 6 km focal scale, we found that bat activity \n\ntended to be negatively related to the percentage of forest cover, but positively \n\nassociated with increasing areas of maize fields. At the 3 km scale, bat activity tended \n\nto be higher when larger extensions of Bocage were present. On the other hand, bat \n\nactivity tends to be negatively associated with patch density and percentage of rice \n\nfields at this scale. Confining the scale to the 1.5 km level, a similar positive tendency \n\nwas found between bat activity and the percentage of Bocage cover. Additionally, at \n\nthe 1.5 km focal scale, bat activity tended to be positively linked with the percentage of \n\nrice field cover. \n\nAt the local scale, we found a robust positive association between bat activity and air \n\ntemperature and Diptera abundance. Furthermore, bat activity tended to vary with \n\nhabitat type (marginally non-significant higher activity on urban sites; p=0.08), and \n\ntended to be negatively related with atmospheric pressure.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 \n\n \n60 \n\n  \n\nSpecies \nStatus Bat passes per habitat type \n\nPT IUCN Boc For Mai Mar Ree Ric Rus Urb \n\nClosed-habitat foragers           \n\n   Plecotus auritus/P. austriacus DD/LC LC/LC 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n\nEdge foragers           \n\n   Barbastella barbastellus DD NT 0 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 \n\nMyotis spp.   1 1 7 1 3 0 0 0 \n\n   M. daubentonii LC LC 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 \n\n   M. escalerai - - 0 1 0 3 0 1 1 0 \n\n   M. myotis/M. blythii VU/CR LC/LC 0 6 0 2 3 1 3 0 \n\nPipistrellus spp.   19 6 9 2 15 15 7 30 \n\n   P. kuhlii LC LC 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 \n\n   P. pipistrellus LC LC 29 6 9 2 15 15 7 30 \n\n   P. pygmaeus LC LC 153 58 95 53 97 123 87 245 \n\nOpen-space foragers           \n\nEptesicus spp./Nyctalus spp.   2 3 2 0 0 2 3 1 \n\n   Eptesicus serotinus/E. isabellinus LC/ - LC/ - 13 38 9 12 17 10 12 23 \n\nNyctalus spp.   5 4 3 0 9 1 2 0 \n\n   N. lasiopterus/N. noctula DD/DD NT/LC 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 \n\n   N. leisleri DD LC 0 10 2 2 7 0 2 3 \n\nTadarida teniotis DD LC 0 1 1 2 5 14 9 2 \n\nTable 4. 2 List of species recorded, and respective classification in guilds and conservation status in Portugal (Cabral et al., 2005), and worldwide (IUCN, 2013), and total \n\nnumber of bat passes recorded in each habitat type.

Furthermore, this relation continued at the 3 km focal scale, \n\nsince a robust positive association was between the two. Also, the activity of the open -\n\nspace foragers tended to be negatively related with landscape connectivity. At the \n\nsmallest landscape scale (1.5 km), the activity of the open-space foraging guild was \n\nrobustly and positively linked with forest cover and total watercourse length. At the local \n\nscale we found a robust, positive association between the activity of the open-space \n\nforagers and the abundance of Lepidoptera. \n\nConcerning the activity of the edge-foragers, it tended to be higher with greater edge \n\nlengths, and lower when greater extensions of maize fields were present, at the 6 km focal \n\nscale. At the 3 km scale, we found that the activity of the edge-foraging guild tended to be \n\nnegatively related to patch density. At the 1.5 km focal scale, the activity of this guild \n\ntended to be positively related with patch shape complexity, and with percentage of \n\nBocage cover. At the local level, a robust positive association between the activity of the \n\nedge foragers and air temperature was found. Additionally, the activity of these species \n\nwas robustly linked to the abundance of Diptera, and negatively to Coleoptera abundance \n\nand atmospheric pressure. Despite the strong associations established for the activity of \n\nedge-foragers at the local scale, the model presenting best fit only included air-\n\ntemperature as an explanatory variable (Table 4.4).  \n\n \n\nSpecies richness \n\n \n\nNo relationships were found between species richness and landscape variables neither at \n\nthe 6 and 3 km scales. At the 1.5 km scale, species richness tended to be positively \n\nassociated with forest cover. However, the null model still presented the best fit (Table \n\n4.4).  \n\nAt the local scale, we found a robust relationship between species richness and air \n\ntemperature.

DISCUSSION \n\n \n\nBat responses across landscape scales \n\n \n\nHabitat heterogeneity, at least to a certain level, has been linked to higher abundance \n\nand/or diversity of several taxa, such as birds (MacArthur and MacArthur, 1961; Gilroy et \n\nal., 2010), small terrestrial mammals (Cramer and Willig, 2002; Dalkvist et al., 2011), and \n\ncarnivores (Mestre et al., 2007; Pita et al., 2009). Bats are also no exception to this \n\n(Bernard and Fenton, 2002; Estrada and Coates-Estrada, 2002; Gorresen and Willig, \n\n2004; Yates and Muzika, 2006; Bernard and Fenton, 2007; Ethier and Fahrig, 2011). In \n\nsome situations, a matrix characterized by several interspersed patches of small size and \n\nvarying land cover type seems to provide complementary resources for bats (Cramer and \n\nWillig, 2005; Ethier and Fahrig, 2011) some of them vital, such as roosting, foraging and \n\ndrinking sites (Law and Dickman, 1998), within short distances.  \n\nOur results indicate that a higher number of patches per unit of area favours the activity of \n\nthe species that compose the open-space foragers guild. This is supported by the robust, \n\npositive relationship, found between the activity of the open-space foragers and patch \n\ndensity at the 3 km focal scale, following a similar tendency at the 6 km scale. Despite not \n\nproviding information on patch type, size and distribution, this landscape metric can be \n\ninterpreted as a simple measure of landscape fragmentation (Dewan et al., 2012). This \n\nmay reinforce the importance of the mosaic of habitats for bats if the patch types are \n\ndiverse, which is likely due to the heterogeneous character of the study area.  \n\nOur findings are consistent to those of Klingbeil and Willig (2009) and Estrada-Villegas et \n\nal. (2010), who also found positive effects of fragmentation on the abundance of species \n\nadapted to forage in open areas. Habitat use is strongly dependent on species eco-\n\nmorphological traits (Fenton, 1990; Schnitzler and Kalko, 2001), so bat responses to \n\nhabitat fragmentation and heterogeneity are expected to vary among guilds and species. \n\nThat hypothesis was supported by our results since, contrary to the open-space foragers, \n\nthe activity of the edge foragers tended to be lower with higher patch densities, at least at \n\nthe 3 km focal scale. Fuentes-Montemayor et al. (2013), also found a negative influence \n\nof fragmentation on edge-foraging species such as those of the genera Pipistrellus and \n\nMyotis. Additionally, Estrada-Villegas et al. (2010) found a similar influence of \n\nfragmentation on closed-habitat foragers, justified mostly by their slow and manoeuvrable \n\nflight, which makes long commuting flights energetically expensive. \n\n\n\nBATS IN HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPES \n\n \n65 \n\nSeveral authors have found higher levels of bat activity near linear structures and habitat \n\nedges (e.g. Verboom and Huitema, 1997; Lentini et al., 2012). Our results go in \n\naccordance with those studies. First, the activity of the edge foragers, at least at the 6 km \n\nfocal scale, tended to be higher with greater edge lengths, though this was a relation not \n\nfollowed by open-space foraging species. Furthermore, at the 1.5 km scale, the activity of \n\nthe edge-foragers tended to be higher with an increase in patch shape complexity. \n\nGreater shape complexity often implies longer boundaries between habitats (i.e. edge), \n\nreinforcing the aforesaid relationship. Contrary to our results, Fuentes-Montemayor et al. \n\n(2013) found woodland edge density to be negatively associated with the activity of \n\nPipistrellus and Myotis species, and that the activity of these species was higher in \n\nwoodland interior than in woodland edge.  \n\nAlso, both total bat activity (at the 3 km and 1.5 km focal scales) and the activity of edge \n\nforaging bats (at the 1.5 km focal scale) tended to be higher when greater percentages of \n\nBocage land cover were present. The greater availability of linear structures such as the \n\ntypical live fences of this habitat type may provide species like P. pipistrellus and P. \n\npygmaeus optimal foraging sites, as well as protection against predators and adverse \n\nweather conditions (Verboom and Huitema, 1997). The dense network of freshwater \n\nchannels along with those hedgerows may work as a commuting route for these bats, \n\nwhile also providing drinking water. The positive tendencies found between the activity of \n\nedge foragers and total edge length, shape complexity and Bocage land cover emphasise \n\nthe importance of edge habitats and linear structures for species that share the eco-\n\nmorphological traits that characterize this guild \u2013 slow and energetically inexpensive flight \n\ntype, average wing loading and aspect ratio, and echolocation pulses composed of both \n\nbroad and narrowband components. \n\nAt the smallest landscape scale studied \u2013 1.5 km \u2013 we found strong associations between \n\nthe activity of open-space foragers and the percentage of forest cover and length of \n\nwatercourses. Forest importance for European bat species is well documented, both as \n\nforaging (e.g. Vaughan et al., 1997; Russ and Montgomery, 2002; Davidson-Watts et al., \n\n2006) and roosting (Russo et al. 2004; Dietz et al. 2009; Boughey et al. 2011) habitats, \n\nthus the importance of the amount of forest on bat activity is not surprising. Boughey et al. \n\n(2011) found that, within a small scale, roost location of E. serotinus (among other \n\nspecies) was strongly associated with the proximity of woodland patches. Species of the \n\ngenus Nyctalus are also known to roost within woodland patches, mainly on tree holes \n\n(Dietz et al., 2009; Popa-Lisseanu et al., 2009), while T. teniotis often uses woodland \n\nhabitats as foraging grounds (Marques et al., 2004; Rainho, 2007; Matos et al., 2011). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 \n\n \n66 \n\nHowever, the forests of the BVL landscape are mostly Eucalyptus stands, which are often \n\nassociated with lower animal diversity and abundance, including bats (e.g. Russo and \n\nJones 2003; Matos 2011) and other taxa (e.g. arthropods, Zahn et al. 2009; birds, \n\nMarsden et al. 2001; Proen\u00e7a et al., 2010; small non-volant mammals, Carey and \n\nJohnson, 1995), and do not seem to provide suitable roosts for bats. However, these \n\nforested areas still harbour some autochthonous trees such as Quercus sp. that, despite \n\nhaving low densities, may enable the occurrence of some bat species by providing some \n\nroosts.  \n\nThe strong relationship found between the activity of open-space foragers and total \n\nwatercourse length reinforces the importance of riparian habitats for bats (e.g. Walsh and \n\nHarris, 1996; Grindal et al., 1999; Rainho, 2007). Freshwater courses not only provide a \n\nsource of drinking water for bats, but these and the several brackish water channels \n\npresent in the study area may also function as foraging grounds (Menzel et al., 2005; \n\nRainho, 2007; Lookingbill et al., 2010) and commuting routes (Grindal et al., 1999; Fukui \n\net al., 2006; Lloyd et al., 2006). \n\n \n\nBat responses at the local scale \n\n \n\nAir temperature is one of the most limiting factors of bat activity in temperate regions, \n\neither through direct influence or subsequent food shortages during the cold winter \n\nmonths (Kapfer and Aron, 2007). Indeed, we found that weather conditions, particularly air \n\ntemperature, strongly influence bat activity and species richness; the models presenting \n\nbest fits for the activity of edge foragers and species richness only included this predictor. \n\nWithin the study area, local variation in air temperature was clear, varying within the same \n\nnight, between different sites, up to 6.8\u00baC.  \n\nWe also found robust associations between prey abundance and bat activity. However, \n\nbats response to prey abundance differed between open-space and edge-space foraging \n\nbats. While the activity of open-space foragers was strongly associated with the \n\nabundance of Lepidoptera, the activity of the edge foragers was linked with the \n\nabundance of Diptera.  \n\nOpen-space foragers are known to feed on Lepidoptera. T. teniotis seems to mainly feed \n\non this taxa (Rydell and Arlettaz, 1994), which also constitutes a great part of the diet of E. \n\nserotinus (Robinson and Stebbings, 1993; Kervyn and Libois, 2008; Mikula and Cmokov\u00e1, \n\n2012). The feeding on Lepidopera by Nyctalus spp. has also been documented (Waters et \n\nal., 1995; Dietz et al., 2009, and references therein). This seems to justify the strong \n\npositive relationship between the activity of open-space foragers and the abundance of \n\n\n\nBATS IN HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPES \n\n \n67 \n\nLepidoptera. On the other hand, the strong association between the activity of edge-space \n\nforagers and the abundance of Diptera may be related to the preference shown by P. \n\npygmaeus and P. pipistrellus (the most frequently recorded species) for those prey (Swift \n\net al., 1985; Barlow, 1997; Vaughan, 1997; Bartonicka et al., 2008). \n\n \n\nKeystone structures and vital resources in a heterogeneous landscape \n\n \n\nTews et al. (2004) defined a keystone structure as \u201ca distinct spatial structure providing \n\nresources, shelter or \u2018goods and services\u2019 crucial for other species\u201d. Under the light of \n\nsuch definition, and taking in consideration our results, we may assume that woodlands \n\nrepresent a keystone structure for the open-space foragers guild. Our results also suggest \n\nthat Bocage may represent a keystone structure for the edge-foraging species.  \n\nAs expected, prey abundance (for both guilds) and freshwater availability (for open -space \n\nforagers) stood out as important predictors of bat activity. Changes in food supply are \n\nconsidered to be one of the key factors determining spatial (Robinson and Stebbings, \n\n1997; Kusch and Idelberger, 2005) and seasonal (Bartonicka and Zukal, 2003; Meyer et \n\nal., 2004; Ramos Pereira et al., 2010) variation in bat activity. Our results suggest that, \n\nwithin the heterogeneous landscape of BVL, bat activity is not mainly limited by land cover \n\ntype, but rather by prey abundance and weather conditions. Therefore, we may assume \n\nthat the habitat types that shape the BVL matrix provide a high complementation of \n\nresources, though woodlands and Bocage probably act as keystone structures. \n\n \n\nConclusions \n\n \n\nBat activity and distribution within the heterogeneous landscape of the BVL seems to be \n\nunder the influence of several environmental factors, acting at different levels and scales. \n\nOverall, bats seem to respond to different factors, from wider scales where landscape \n\nphysiognomy variables (i.e. fragmentation and edge length) are the most influencing ones, \n\nto a finer one where keystone habitats and vital resources (e.g. roosting sites and \n\nfreshwater availability) are the limiting factors. At a local scale, prey availability and \n\nweather conditions (mainly air temperature) are the main factors dictating site selection. \n\nOur results support the findings of several studies that described scale-dependent effects \n\nof environmental variables on various aspects of the ecology of bats (e.g. Gorresen et al., \n\n2005; Perry et al., 2008; Pinto and Keitt, 2008; Klingbeil and Willig, 2009; Ethier and \n\nFahrig, 2011) and other taxa (e.g. plants, Graham and Knight, 2004; Okland et al., 2006; \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 \n\n \n68 \n\nfish, Yeager et al., 2011; small non-volant mammals, Morris, 1992; and marsupials, Lyons \n\nand Willig, 2002).  \n\nBats seem to be sensitive to local resource availability and distribution, while \n\nsimultaneously reacting to broader landscape features. However, the smallest and wider \n\nscales to which an organism responds depends on the animals\u2019 eco-morphology (i.e. size, \n\nmobility, life-history traits) since a given mosaic can be interpreted in a \u201cfine-grained\u201d way \n\nby a certain species, and in a \u201ccoarse-grained\u201d fashion by others (Kotliar and Wiens, \n\n1990), sometimes even in the same family or order. Furthermore, different species may \n\nrespond to distinct landscape features, depending on those eco-morphological traits. Our \n\nresults revealed different influencing variables on the activity of the open-space and edge-\n\nspace foraging guilds. Similar results were obtained by Klingbeil and Willig (2009), who \n\nfound guild-specific responses to forest fragmentation. Gorresen et al. (2005), Perry et al. \n\n(2008), Pinto and Keitt (2008) and Ethier and Fahrig (2011) also found species-specific \n\nresponses to distinct landscape features, such as patch size, shape and proximity, forest \n\ncover, and woodland characteristics. Some of these species-specific responses may be \n\nmasked by our analysis at the guild level, since it mostly reflects the responses of the \n\ndominant taxa. Further work, and more robust data is necessary to assess those species-\n\nspecific responses in the BVL landscape, particularly to closed-habitat foragers, since we \n\nwere not able to investigate their interaction with the heterogeneous landscape of BVL. \n\nMost likely, landscape fragmentation and heterogeneity will be found to negatively affect \n\nthese species, since they are strictly associated with forested habitats, and due to their \n\neco-morphological traits (e.g. slow and energetically expensive flight) they have low \n\nmobility, thus making commuting between distant patches too costly. Still, our approach is \n\ncertainly more detailed than one performed, for instance, at the assemblage level, \n\nbecause it provides some insight on the differences between functional groups (Klingbeil \n\nand Willig, 2009).  \n\nOur study underlines the importance of multi-scale approaches to effectively assess the \n\ninfluence of landscape composition and physiognomy on bat activity. Furthermore, a \n\ndeeper look into species-specific and/or guild responses is essential. In fact, such \n\nanalyses may enable the identification of the most important landscape characteristics for \n\nthe studied taxa, as well as of keystone structures and vital resources, facilitating the \n\nrecognition of important conservation areas, and the design of effective conservation \n\nplans as an important support for land management. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 5 \n\n \n\nGENERAL DISCUSSION \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n71 \n\n5. GENERAL DISCUSSION \n\n \n\n5.1 STUDY DESIGN AND MAIN FINDINGS \n\n \n\nBVL is a coastal wetland. Here the landscape is composed by a matrix of natural, semi-\n\nnatural and human-altered habitats. Despite being known as a rich area in terms of \n\nbiodiversity (Brito et al., 2010), little is known about the spatial and seasonal patterns of \n\nvertebrate distribution, and about the factors that underline those patterns. In this study, \n\nwe assessed several aspects of the ecology of bats, so that the interaction between this \n\ngroup of animals and the heterogeneous landscape of BVL could be better understood.  \n\nFirstly, we investigated the composition and structuring patterns of bat assemblages, and \n\ncompared those patterns among seasons and among the main habitats that shape the \n\nlandscape. Secondly, we assessed the spatial dynamics of bat activity, so that the habitat \n\npreferences of bats could be unveiled, taking into consideration their differences in \n\nforaging strategy and morphology. Furthermore, we also studied differences in bat activity \n\nacross seasons. Subsequently, it was important to focus on the processes that underline \n\nthose patterns. Thus, we assessed the influence of several features acting at local and \n\nlandscape on the patterns of bat richness and activity. Moreover, we investigated the \n\nscale-dependency of the response given by bat activity and richness, by analysing the \n\neffects of the features across a gradient of focal scales. Finally, we analysed the different \n\nresponses given by different bat guilds, composed by species with distinct eco-\n\nmorphological traits, to landscape and local features.  \n\nThe main findings/conclusions obtained through each of the abovementioned steps are: \n\n \n\nBat assembly structuring across habitats and seasons \n\n \n\ni) Bat assemblage structure and composition was found to be similar among the \n\neight habitat types studied; \n\nii) A significant variation in bat diversity, richness and evenness was found \n\nthroughout the study period. \n\n \n\nSpatial and seasonal patterns of activity \n\n \n\ni) Overall, few differences in the activity patterns of the different bat species across \n\nhabitats were found;  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \n\n \n72 \n\nii) Higher activity levels were detected in urban sites (P. pygmaeus), Bocage (P. \n\npygmaeus and P. pipistrellus) and forests (N. leisleri); \n\niii) Bat activity in the different habitat types varied throughout the study period, \n\nprobably due to shifts in prey availability. \n\n \n\nConclusions \n\n \n\ni) Bats seem to interpret the BVL landscape matrix as a whole, rather than selecting \n\nor exploiting the different habitat types individually; \n\nii) The heterogeneous landscape that characterizes the BVL region seems to provide \n\na mosaic of opportunities for bats, which freely exploit the resources across different land \n\ncover settings and according to their temporal variation. \n\n \n\nBat responses across landscape scales \n\n \n\ni) Bat activity responses to landscape features are both scale- and guild-dependent; \n\nii) At broader scales, bats seem to respond to mainly to landscape physiognomy \n\nfeatures, such as fragmentation, patch shape complexity and edge length, while at finer \n\nscales, landscape composition features such as land cover proportions and water \n\navailability, seem to be the most influencing ones; \n\n \n\nBat responses at the local scale \n\n \n\ni) Locally, bat activity is driven mainly by weather conditions (particularly air \n\ntemperature) and by prey abundance. \n\n \n\nConclusions \n\n \n\ni) Bats seem to respond to different factors, from wider scales where landscape \n\nphysiognomy variables (i.e. fragmentation and edge length) are the most influencing ones, \n\nto a finer one where keystone habitats and vital resources (e.g. roosting sites and \n\nfreshwater availability) are the limiting factors; \n\nii) Site selection is not mainly limited by land cover type, but rather by prey \n\nabundance and weather conditions; \n\niii) Woodlands and Bocage may be regarded as \u201ckeystone structures\u201d for bats within \n\nthe BVL landscape. \n\n \n\n\n\nDISCUSSION \n\n \n73 \n\n5.2 BATS AND THE HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPE OF BAIXO VOUGA LAGUNAR \n\n \n\nSince bat assemblages of the sampled habitat types were similar, and almost no species-\n\nhabitat associations were established, bats seem to exploit all habitat types present in the \n\nBVL landscape. This may be partly explained by the generalist character of some of the \n\nrecorded species (e.g. E. serotinus, Rainho, 2007; N. leisleri, Lundy and Montgomery, \n\n2010; P. pipistrellus, Russo and Jones, 2003). Furthermore, many species may depend \n\non multiple habitats to fulfil their daily and seasonal needs, especially to deal with different \n\nrequirements along the various stages of their life-cycle stages (Law and Dickman, 1998; \n\nLookingbill et al., 2010). An increase in the structural complexity of a habitat mosaic leads \n\nto the availability of more ecological niches, and promotes several distinct opportunities \n\nfor resource exploitation (habitat heterogeneity hypothesis, Bazzaz, 1975; Tews et al., \n\n2004). Since bats are highly vagile, able to readily move between adjacent patches within \n\nthe BVL heterogeneous landscape, they are probably able to exploit the different \n\nresources provided by different patches, and according to their temporal fluctuations. The \n\nBVL landscape contains different patch types, potentially providing adequate foraging and \n\nroosting habitats, as well as vital resources such as freshwater and prey, all located within \n\nshort distances (landscape complementation, Dunning et al., 1992); this is probably the \n\nreason why land cover influence was shown to be relatively reduced.  \n\n \n\n \n\n5.3 \u2018KEYSTONE STRUCTURES\u2019 AND VITAL RESOURCES \n\n \n\nFrom the analysis performed, three habitat types stand out from the remaining, \n\nconcerning the levels of bat activity. Firstly, urban sites revealed higher levels of activity of \n\nP. pygmaeus, and a positive tendency to higher levels of total bat activity and of edge \n\nforaging species. Foraging in urban environments is not an unusual behaviour for several \n\nspecies of bats, since high densities of prey may occur, particularly around streetlights \n\n(Gaisler et al., 1998; Rydell, 1992; Avila-Flores and Fenton, 2005). The proximity of \n\nhuman settlements to woodlands and riparian habitats in the BVL landscape, may also \n\nprovide these species with additional suitable foraging habitats.  \n\nThe activity of N. leisleri was positively related to forest sites, and a strong positive relation \n\nwas found between the activity of the open-space foraging guild and forest cover, at the \n\nfinest landscape scale approached. The importance of woodlands for European bat \n\nspecies is well documented, both as foraging (e.g. Vaughan et al., 1997; Russ and \n\nMontgomery, 2002; Davidson-Watts et al., 2006) and roosting (Russo et al., 2004; Dietz et \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \n\n \n74 \n\nal., 2009; Boughey et al., 2011) habitats. Of the open-space foraging species, E. serotinus \n\nwas found to select roosts closely located to woodland patches (Boughey et al., 2011), \n\nwhile species of the genus Nyctalus usually roost within them, mainly on tree holes (Dietz \n\net al., 2009; Popa-Lisseanu et al., 2009). T. teniotis, on the other hand, its known to use \n\nthese habitats as foraging grounds, where it usually feeds above the canopy (Marques et \n\nal., 2004; Rainho, 2007; Matos et al., 2011).  \n\nLaslty, higher levels of activity of both P. pygmaeus and P. pipistrellus were found in \n\nBocage, and linked to higher activity levels of the edge foraging guild at two focal scales. \n\nThe greater availability of linear structures such as the typical live fences of this habitat \n\ntype may provide these species optimal foraging sites, as well as protection against \n\npredators and adverse weather conditions (Verboom and Huitema, 1997). The dense \n\nnetwork of freshwater channels along with those hedgerows may work as a commuting \n\nroute for these bats, while also providing drinking water. \n\nFollowing the definition of \u201ckeystone structure\u201d provided by Tews et al. (2004), the \n\nclassification of these habitats as keystone structures for bats within the heterogeneous \n\nlandscape of BVL seems reasonable. \n\n \n\nAs expected, vital resources stood out as important predictors of bat activity. The activity \n\nof both guilds was influenced by prey abundance (Diptera for the edge-foraging species, \n\nand Lepidoptera for the open-space foragers), and the activity of the open-space foragers \n\nwas also positively related to freshwater availability. Changes in food supply are \n\nconsidered to be one of the key factors determining spatial (Robinson and Stebbings, \n\n1997; Kusch and Idelberger, 2005) and seasonal (Bartonicka and Zukal, 2003; Meyer et \n\nal., 2004; Ramos Pereira et al., 2010) variation in bat activity. Our results revealed that \n\nprey abundance and weather conditions, particularly air temperature, despite related, \n\nwere the variables that better explained the seasonal changes in bat activity in the BVL. \n\nFurthermore, prey abundance seemed to influence more the process of site selection than \n\nland cover type, emphasising the opportunistic character of several species. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nDISCUSSION \n\n \n75 \n\n5.4 SCALE- AND GUILD-DEPENDENCY OF THE RESPONSES GIVEN BY BATS \n\n \n\nWe found that bat activity and richness, within the heterogeneous landscape of BVL, \n\nseem to be influenced by landscape physiognomy and composition, and regulated by \n\nweather conditions and prey abundance. Furthermore, we found that the responses given \n\nby bats to these features changed across a scale gradient. The results obtained in this \n\nstudy support the findings of several works that described scale-dependent effects of \n\nenvironmental variables on various aspects of the ecology of bats (e.g. Gorresen et al., \n\n2005; Perry et al., 2008; Pinto and Keitt, 2008; Klingbeil and Willig, 2009; Ethier and \n\nFahrig, 2011) and other taxa (e.g. plants, Graham and Knight, 2004; Okland et al., 2006; \n\nfish, Yeager et al., 2011; small non-volant mammals, Morris, 1992; and marsupials, Lyons \n\nand Willig, 2002). However, the eco-morphological traits of an organism, such as size, \n\nmobility and life-history traits, limit the scale to which it responds to environmental \n\nfeatures. In fact, a given mosaic can be interpreted in a \u201cfine-grained\u201d way by a certain \n\nspecies, and in a \u201ccoarse-grained\u201d fashion by others (Kotliar and Wiens, 1990), therefore \n\nspecies with different eco-morphological traits are expected to respond differently. \n\nAccordingly, species differing in morphology and hunting strategies were found to respond \n\nto different landscape features within the BVL. Similar results were obtained by Klingbeil \n\nand Willig (2009), who found guild-specific responses to forest fragmentation. Gorresen et \n\nal. (2005), Perry et al. (2008), Pinto and Keitt (2008) and Ethier and Fahrig (2011) also \n\nfound species-specific responses to distinct landscape features, such as patch size, \n\nshape and proximity, forest cover, and woodland characteristics.  \n\n \n\n \n\n5.5 CONSERVATION IMPLICATIONS \n\n \n\nFuture strategies designed towards the conservation of bats within the BVL landscape, or \n\non heterogeneous landscapes elsewhere, should include a multi-scale approach, so that it \n\ncan effectively manage both landscape composition and physiognomy features that \n\npromote the activity and richness of bat species. Furthermore, since species respond \n\ndifferently to landscape features, species-specific analysis should be performed. Such \n\nanalyses may enable the identification of the most important landscape characteristics for \n\nthe studied taxa, as well as of keystone structures and vital resources, facilitating the \n\nrecognition of important conservation areas, and the design of effective conservation \n\nplans as an important support for land management. However, species-specific \n\napproaches often involve greater costs and human resources, and are frequently time-\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \n\n \n76 \n\nconsuming. Thus, alternatively, a guild-specific approach may be applied, since it provides \n\ninformation for a group of species sharing eco-morphological traits. Nonetheless, guild-\n\nlevel approaches may mask the rarest species responses, as it reflects mainly the \n\nresponses of the dominant taxa. Therefore, the identification of umbrella species is critical \n\nfor prioritizing conservation areas (Rainho and Palmeirim, 2013).  \n\n \n\nWoodlands (forest patches and Bocage) were found to be the most important habitats for \n\nbats within the BVL landscape, probably acting as keystone structures for these animals. \n\nThese habitats may provide adequate roosting and foraging habitats, while additionally \n\noffering commuting routes and freshwater, through the linear structures and water courses \n\nfound on Bocage. However, the absence of broadleaved woodlands may negatively affect \n\nthe strict forest-dwelling species such as B. barbastellus and Plecotus spp., which were \n\nrarely recorded during this study. Although the detectability of bats sampled is lower within \n\nforest patches (Walsh et al., 2004) where these species forage and roost, the few \n\nrecordings we got may also suggest they are rare within the BVL landscape. Therefore, \n\nthe creation/restoration of broadleaved woodlands may be adequate to provide additional \n\nroosting and foraging habitats for these species, while also favouring other bats that \n\nusually roost in such habitats, such as those of the genus Nyctalus (Dietz et al., 2009; \n\nPopa-Lisseanu et al., 2009). \n\n \n\nLastly, the results obtained in this study revealed that higher levels of the activity of some \n\nspecies were related to edge length and to Bocage cover, which is composed by a dense \n\nnetwork of linear structures. Since a great proportion of the BVL landscape is composed \n\nby maize fields, characterized by great areas of crop fields, managed in a somehow \n\nintensive fashion, the promotion of hedgerows and tree lines around them may also favour \n\nbat activity and occurrence. Linear elements such as those, have also been found to \n\npositively influence bat activity in agricultural areas in other studies (Verboom and \n\nHuitema, 1997; Russ and Montgomery, 2002; Fuentes-Montemayor et al., 2011; Lentini et \n\nal., 2012). The creation of these structures around the larger crop fields may provide \n\nforaging and roosting habitats for bats, as well as protective commuting routes in these \n\nopen areas. Furthermore, promoting the activity of insectivorous bats near crop fields may \n\nresult in a better control of insect pests species, thus resulting in a direct service to human \n\npopulations. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nDISCUSSION \n\n \n77 \n\n5.6 FUTURE WORKS \n\n \n\nFuture research on bat ecology in the BVL should focus on species-specific responses to \n\nlandscape composition and physiognomy. Such approaches may elucidate the differences \n\namong species, and enable the assessment of the responses given by rare species. \n\nFurthermore, these analyses may allow the identification of umbrella species, and \n\ntherefore provide essential information for future conservation plans. \n\nSince roost availability is one of the most limiting factors for bat distribution within a \n\nregion, further studies should be made about roost availability within the BVL landscape, \n\nparticularly for species that depend on woodlands for roosting, namely species from the \n\ngenera Nyctalus and Plecotus, and for B. barbastellus.  \n\nRadio-tracking studies should also be developed, so that more information could be \n\ngathered on species movements within this heterogeneous landscape, giving insight \n\nabout species home-ranges and core areas, as well as about potential seasonal \n\nmigrations of different species of bats.  \n\nLastly, studies about the ecosystem services provided by bats in this agricultural \n\nlandscape should be performed, focusing on the effect insectivorous bats have in pest \n\ncontrol, and on the consequent benefits obtained by land owners. Bat-boxes could be \n\nsetup on some of the fields, thus promoting bat roosting and foraging activity in the \n\nsurrounding areas, and total production compared to control crops. Additionally, \n\nproduction values should also be compared between crops under the influence of \n\npesticides and control ones. By comparing total productions (or the losses due to insect \n\nherbivory), and the costs of bat-boxes versus pesticide use, both pest control service \n\nimportance and its economic advantages could be assessed. However, monitoring the \n\nmore specialized species would be essential, since bat boxes usually favour the most \n\nspecies that are known generalists. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nChapter 6 \n\n \n\nREFERENCES  \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n81 \n\n6.
