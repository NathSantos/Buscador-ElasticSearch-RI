No entanto, n\u00e3o \u00e9 claro \n\nque altera\u00e7\u00f5es biomec\u00e2nicas tridimensionais ocorrerem. Atrav\u00e9s do acompanhamento \n\nda mulher na gravidez e p\u00f3s-parto, os objetivos da presente tese foram: 1) determinar \n\nos par\u00e2metros temporais e espaciais do ciclo da marcha; 2) descrever a cinem\u00e1tica \n\nangular do membro inferior; 3) calcular os momentos e pot\u00eancias articulares do \n\ntornozelo, joelho e coxofemoral, utilizando o c\u00e1lculo por din\u00e2mica inversa; 4) descrever \n\nas magnitudes dos picos dos momentos e pot\u00eancias articulares dos membros \n\ninferiores; 5) identificar poss\u00edveis diferen\u00e7as entre as fases de recolha relativamente \n\naos par\u00e2metros biomec\u00e2nicos; 6) descrever longitudinalmente a composi\u00e7\u00e3o corporal \n\nas altera\u00e7\u00f5es morfol\u00f3gicas; 7) analisar a influ\u00eancia das altera\u00e7\u00f5es antropom\u00e9tricas na \n\ncin\u00e9tica articular. Os resultados mostram que as mulheres mant\u00eam os par\u00e2metros \n\ntemporais e espaciais da marcha. A cinem\u00e1tica angular do membro inferior tem o \n\nmesmo padr\u00e3o, no entanto, a magnitude de alguns picos, especialmente na bacia e \n\ncoxofemoral durante a fase terminal do apoio, pr\u00e9-balan\u00e7o e de balan\u00e7o, apresentam \n\naltera\u00e7\u00f5es significativas. A coxofemoral \u00e9 a articula\u00e7\u00e3o com mais altera\u00e7\u00f5es na \n\ncin\u00e9tica articular, com um aumento da carga interna associada aos momentos \n\narticulares da coxofemoral no plano transversal. No entanto, diversos momentos e \n\npot\u00eancias articulares revelam uma diminui\u00e7\u00e3o significativa para o final da gravidez e/ou \n\num aumento entre alguns trimestres da gravidez e o p\u00f3s-parto. Como esperado, a \n\nmaioria das vari\u00e1veis associadas \u00e0 composi\u00e7\u00e3o corporal e \u00e0s dimens\u00f5es corporais tem \n\num aumento significativo durante a gravidez e uma diminui\u00e7\u00e3o no p\u00f3s-parto. Os \n\nmodelos desenvolvidos para prever a carga interna aplicada ao membro inferior da \n\ngr\u00e1vida atrav\u00e9s de vari\u00e1veis antropom\u00e9tricas, incluem quatro modelos com vari\u00e1veis \n\nassociadas \u00e0 quantidade de gordura, quatro modelos com vari\u00e1veis associadas \u00e0 \n\nmassa corporal global, tr\u00eas modelos que incluem a massa livre de gordura, e um \n\nmodelo que inclui a forma do tronco. Os altos valores do R2 ajustado, mostram que as \n\naltera\u00e7\u00f5es na composi\u00e7\u00e3o corporal e morfologia, determinam em grande parte a \n\ncin\u00e9tica articular da mulher nesta fase particular da vida. \n\nPalavras-chave: gravidez, marcha, cinem\u00e1tica, cin\u00e9tica, composi\u00e7\u00e3o corporal.  \n\n\n\n \nXII \n\n  \n\n\n\n \nXIII \n\nTitle \n\nBiomechanical and morphological adaptations in women during pregnancy and \n\nthe postpartum period in walking \n\nAbstract  \n\nPregnancy is a special phase of women's lives, which process leads to several \n\nchanges in hormonal, anatomical, body composition, and musculoskeletal systems of \n\nwomen. However, it is not clear what three-dimensional biomechanical changes occur \n\nat this stage. With the longitudinal monitoring of woman's in pregnancy and \n\npostpartum, the purposes of the present thesis were to: 1) determine the temporal \n\nparameters of the gait cycle pregnant women; 2) describe the angular kinematics of the \n\nlower limb of the pregnant women; 3) calculate net moments of force in ankle, knee \n\nand hip joints, using inverse dynamics; 4) describe peak magnitudes of the joint \n\nmoments of force of the pregnant women; 5) to identify potential differences between \n\nthe four collection phases on the biomechanical parameters, concerning gait cycle; 6) \n\ndescribe the body composition of women and their morphological changes; 7) Analyse \n\nthe influence of anthropometric variables in the kinetics of joints of women. Results \n\nshow that women maintain the same temporal and spatial parameters of gait \n\nthroughout pregnancy and in the postpartum period. The angular kinematics of lower \n\nlimb have the same curve pattern, however the magnitude of some peaks, especially in \n\npelvis and hip joint during terminal stance, pre-swing and mid-swing phases, suffer \n\nsignificant changes. The hip is the joint with the greatest changes in joint kinetics \n\nduring pregnancy, with an increase of the internal loading associated with the hip \n\nmoments in the transverse plane. In the other planes of motion, joint moments and \n\npower shows a significant decrease to the end of pregnancy or an increase from some \n\nstages of pregnancy to the postpartum period. As expected, most of the variables \n\nassociated with body composition and body dimensions showed, a significant increase \n\nduring pregnancy and a decrease in the postpartum. The models developed to predict \n\nwomen's internal loading through anthropometric variables include, four models with \n\nvariables associated with the amount of fat, four models that with variables related to \n\noverall body weight, three models that include fat-free mass, and one model that \n\nincludes the shape of the trunk as a predictor variable. The high values of adjusted r \n\nsquare, show that changes in maternal\u2019s body composition and morphology, largely \n\ndetermine kinetic dynamics of the female joints in this particular stage of life. \n\nKeywords: pregnancy, gait, kinematics, kinetics, body composition  \n\n\n\n \nXIV \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \nXV \n\nContents \n\nAcknowledgments .........................................................................................

In addition to these changes, the growth and \n\ndevelopment of the foetus, the uterus, all pregnancy-associated tissues, including \n\nplacenta and foetal membranes and also the amount of liquid, contribute to an increase \n\nin the woman\u2019 body weight in an average of 12 kilograms. Of these, the weight of the \n\nfoetus may contribute to 3.5 kg, plus 2 kg corresponding to the weight of the amniotic \n\nfluid, placenta and foetal membranes, more 1 kg for uterine weight and 1 kg for \n\nwoman's breasts. The remaining 4.5 kg corresponds to an increase of blood volume \n\nand extracellular fluid (3 kg), and an increase of body fat (1.5 kg). Much of these \n\ntissues are expelled during birth, and in the following days, the fluid in excess is \n\nexcreted in the urine (Guyton &amp; Hall, 2006). \n\nRecent evidence-based studies show that exercise is safe for both mother and \n\nfoetus. The literature supports the recommendation to initiate or continue exercise in \n\nmost pregnancies (Paisley, Joy, &amp; Price, 2003; Parad, Leonard, &amp; Handler, 2015), \n\neven when it comes to moderate-to-vigorous resistance exercise, since it's a healthy \n\npregnancy (Petrov Fieril, Glantz, &amp; Fagevik Olsen, 2015). Different modes of exercise, \n\nsuch as walking, jogging, cycling and swimming, with low and high intensity are not \n\nassociated with increased miscarriage rates between the first trimester until the middle \n\nof the second trimester (Parad et al., 2015). Walking appears as one of the preferred \n\nmodes of exercise, not only because it is an exercise that uses large muscle groups in \n\na continuous and rhythmic way, but also because it is a physical activity that is easy to \n\ncontrol regarding the intensity of exercise (A.C.O.G., 2003).  \n\nThe biomechanical loading assessment of gait in the musculoskeletal system of \n\npregnant women is of particular interest because this information becomes very \n\nimportant to implement exercise programs for pregnant women and to develop \n\nstrategies to increase adherence. There are many anatomical changes during \n\npregnancy that could potentially lead to gait alterations, and those alterations may \n\ncontribute to musculoskeletal overuse conditions such as back and lower limb pain \n\n(Foti, Davids, &amp; Bagley, 2000). Nevertheless, to conduct an evaluation of the human \n\nmotion, it is necessary to proceed with a description of the pattern, which in the case of \n\nthe walking is well defined and described in the literature (Los Amigos Research \n\nEducation Institute Inc et al., 2001; Perry &amp; Burnfield, 2010; Rose &amp; Gamble, 2006; \n\nVaughan, Davis, &amp; O'Connor, 1999; Whittle, 2007). It is not clear whether the temporal, \n\n\n\nChapter 1 - Introduction \n\n \n\n \n3 \n\nspatial, kinematic and kinetic patterns of gait during pregnancy are the same as the \n\napparently healthy adult population, if the changes that happen in this period are due to \n\npregnancy, or due to the normal processes that take place over time in a perspective of \n\nlifespan development. \n\nIn the last decades, few studies have analysed the mechanics of walking in the \n\nbody of the woman from the beginning of pregnancy (Falola, Gouthon, Koussihouede, \n\nAgossa, &amp; Brisswalter, 2009; W. L. Gilleard, 2013; Hagan &amp; Wong, 2010; Huang, Lin, \n\nHo, Yu, &amp; Chou, 2002). These studies have reported few changes to the temporal, \n\nspatial, kinematic and kinetic pattern of walking gait, but are not mentioned the inherent \n\ncalibration errors of the systems they use, and only some of them use the last \n\ntechnology devices to accomplish these assessments. Thus, it becomes essential a \n\ndetailed quantitative analysis of the movement data, attempting to access the women \n\nfrom the beginning of pregnancy. It is necessary to take into account, however, the \n\ngreat privacy that women give to their condition during at least the first trimester, \n\nusually because many spontaneous miscarriages happen during this period, which can \n\nbe a major barrier to getting women for the sample of the first trimester. Another aspect \n\nthat must be considered is the longitudinal follow-up of the women throughout \n\npregnancy, to the detriment of analysis by cohorts with a cross-sectional design. In \n\norder to detect changes that are due to the course of pregnancy, should be \n\nimplemented an experimental design of longitudinal and prospective type. This type of \n\nexperimental design aims to collect data from the same subjects at more than one \n\npoint over the forward passage of time (Bowling, 2002). To this end we intend to \n\nperform a biomechanical evaluation, which is considered a powerful way of observation \n\nat the highest level of evaluation, where it possible to compare in detail (Winter, 2005), \n\nthe changes that are due to the pregnancy. \n\n General Research Questions \n\nSince there is some diversity in the results and only a minority of studies \n\nconsiders early pregnancy, the questions that arise were the following: \n\n1. Are there any changes in temporal and spatial parameters, and in the \n\nkinematics of the pregnant woman gait, especially in the joints kinematics of the \n\nlower limb? \n\n2. Are there any changes in kinetic parameters of the pregnant woman gait, \n\nespecially in the joints kinetics of the lower limb? \n\n\n\nChapter 1 - Introduction \n\n \n\n \n4 \n\n3. Are morphological and body composition changes of women happening \n\nconsistently since the beginning of pregnancy? \n\n4. Are there any effects of the morphology on the kinetic parameters during \n\npregnancy and postpartum?  \n\n Purposes of the Thesis \n\nIn order to better understand the biomechanics of woman's gait during \n\npregnancy and in the postpartum period, the purposes of the present thesis were to: \n\n1. Determine the temporal parameters of the gait cycle; \n\n2. Describe the angular kinematics of the lower limbs;  \n\n3. Calculate net moments of force in ankle, knee and hip joints, using inverse \n\ndynamics; \n\n4. Describe peak magnitudes of the joint moments and joint powers; \n\n5. Identify potential differences between the four collection phases - first, second \n\nand third trimesters of pregnancy and postpartum period - on the biomechanical \n\nparameters, concerning gait cycle; \n\n6. Describe the body composition of women and their morphological changes \n\nthroughout pregnancy and postpartum; \n\n7. Analyze the influence of anthropometric variables in the kinetics of lower limb \n\njoints. \n\n Thesis Overview \n\nFollowing the present introduction (chapter 1), this thesis embraces a \n\ncompilation of four papers, as follows.  \n\nThe aim of the first study (chapter 2) was to analyze the available evidence on \n\nthe biomechanical adaptations of gait that occur throughout pregnancy and in \n\npostpartum, specifically with regard to the temporal, spatial, kinematic and kinetic \n\nparameters of gait.

If the changes were confirmed, the second \n\nobjective was to ascertain whether women could recover the initial kinematic patterns \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/527940\n\n\nChapter 1 - Introduction \n\n \n\n \n5 \n\nin the postpartum period. In terms of the main objective, it is necessary to describe the \n\nkinematic variables in the joints of the lower limb during gait at the end of the first, \n\nsecond and third trimesters of pregnancy and in the postpartum period.

(in press) \n\nThe aim of the third study (chapter 4) was to assess the gait kinetics, in order to \n\ncheck if there are any changes in the dynamics of the load of women throughout \n\npregnancy and after delivery. To achieve the main objective, it was necessary to \n\ndescribe and quantify the kinetic variables relating to the GRF, joint moments of force, \n\nand joint power of ankle, knee and hip, during gait, at the end of the first, second and \n\nthird trimesters of pregnancy and in the postpartum period.

However, considering the different \n\npublications, the methods used to build the biomechanical model of the woman's lower \n\nlimbs throughout pregnancy and in the postpartum period, was based on the definitions \n\nrecommended by Robertson, Caldwell, Hamill, Kamen, and Whittlesey (2014). For the \n\nconstruction of the Cartesian system for three-dimensional collections the definitions \n\nestablished by Hamill, Selbie, and Kepple (2014), were considered in what concerns to  \n\na setup with at least ten high-speed infrared cameras (Oqus-300, Qualisys, Sweden; \n\nFR: 500 Hz) positioned statically to minimize light reflection artefacts, and three force \n\nplatforms (two Kistler AG, Winterthur, Switzerland, and one Advanced Mechanical \n\nTechnology, Inc., Watertown, U.S.A.; FR: 1000 Hz) in order to collect at least two \n\nconsecutive contacts of the feet on the ground. The three-dimensional space was \n\ncalibrated by wand type, with an exact wand length of 751.4 mm moved randomly \n\nacross the recorded field before the data collection of each participant. Calibration was \n\naccepted if the standard deviation of the wand length measures was below 0.5 mm. \n\nThe marker setup follows the recommendation of Cappozzo, Cappello, DellaCroce, \n\nand Pensalfini (1997) for lower limb segments, and CODA (Charnwood Dynamics Ltd, \n\n\n\nChapter 1 - Introduction \n\n \n\n \n7 \n\nLeicestershire, United Kingdom) protocols for models of the pelvis segment. The \n\nexplanation of the setup marks, to define each segment can be found in Chapters 3 \n\nand 4. \n\nDue to major changes in the pelvic and abdominal volume of the pregnant \n\nwoman, some care has been taken in the construction segment of the pelvis, not only \n\nin the placement of markers (point 1), but also in the selection of the regression \n\nequations used to compute the joint center of the hip (point 2). Thus, for the first point, \n\nto ensure the correct placement of the reflective markers throughout pregnancy, a \n\ncomparison of the length of each segment (whose size is defined by the markers \n\nplaced in proximal and distal extremities) was performed, in particular the right and left \n\nsegments of the shank and the feet. After this comparison, no differences were found \n\nin the size of the segments of shank (F(3,30)=0.049, p=0.985 and F(3,30)=0.580, \n\np=0.633, respectively for right and left shank) and of the feet (F(3,30)=0.372, p=0.774 \n\nand F(3,30)=0.190, p=0.902, respectively for right and left foot).  \n\nIn the second point, for the estimation of hip joint center after the construction of \n\nthe pelvis model, the equations developed by Bell and colleagues (Bell, Brand, &amp; \n\nPedersen, 1989; Bell, Pedersen, &amp; Brand, 1990), by Harrington, Zavatsky, Lawson, \n\nYuan, and Theologis (2007) and by Davis, Ounpuu, Tyburski, and Gage (1991) were \n\nconsidered. Although there are no specific equations to compute the hip joint center of \n\nthe pregnant woman, our choice falls on the equations of Bell and colleagues (Bell et \n\nal., 1989; Bell et al., 1990), for being frequently used and so there are the same basis \n\nfor comparing the results found with the existing publications. \n\nIn the construction of the model global optimization algorithms were considered, \n\noriginally proposed by Lu and O'Connor (1999), where it is assumed that the model \n\nconsists of rigid bodies connected by joints, and where the optimized position is one \n\nwhose multilink model minimizes difference between the measurement and the model \n\ngiven by the coordinates of the markers. These algorithms were then mathematically \n\nimproved by van den Bogert and Su (2008), which considers a minimum markers for \n\ndescribing the position of the segments. In the present study we also use the \n\nLevenberg-Marquardt algorithm in order to make the more efficient calculation of \n\ncommon minimization algorithms (Levenberg, 1944; Marquardt, 1963). In this global \n\noptimization is considered a hierarchy between segments, and in this case the \n\nconstruction of the model and respective kinematic calculations are performed from \n\nproximal to distal segments. In order to reduce errors of the model it is possible to \n\ndefine constraints (limit some degrees of freedom) of every joint, which are presented \n\nin Table 1. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 - Introduction \n\n \n\n \n8 \n\nTable 1.

This procedure allows standardizing the \n\nanalysis of the participants over time and guarantees uniformity across participants. \n\nThe determination of the kinetic variables of the joint moments and joint powers \n\nwas performed by means of inverse dynamics analysis. Therefore three kinds of data \n\nare needed. In first place, the anthropometric data, specifically: the location of the \n\ncoordinate system of each segment in its proximal joint center; the segment mass; its \n\ncenter of mass; and also, its moment of inertia. The determination of the mass of the \n\nsegments was based on regression equations by Dempster (1955). To calculate the \n\ncenter of mass and moment of inertia of the segments, its primitive geometric shape \n\nwas considered (Hanavan, 1964), set by the segment length, the proximal radius and \n\ndistal radius of the segment, calculated by V3D software based on the location of the \n\nmarkers. The kinematic calculations are the second kind of data needed for each \n\nsegment, in order to provide the center of gravity position, translational velocity, \n\ntranslational acceleration, angular velocity, and angular acceleration, which in this \n\nwork, were also computed  in V3D. Finally, the third kind of data were the external \n\nforces, which were collected by three force platforms (two Kistler force platforms and \n\none AMTI) in order to achieve contact forces of the feet during two consecutive gait \n\ncycles. All steps for calculating by means of inverse dynamics method are described in \n\nRobertson et al. (2014) and in C-Motion (2015) website. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 - Introduction \n\n \n\n \n9 \n\n References \n\nA.C.O.G. (2003).

These changes may affect the balance and body \n\nstability and can cause discomfort and pain. The adaptations of the musculoskeletal \n\nsystem due to morphological changes during pregnancy are not fully understood. Few \n\nstudies clarify the biomechanical changes of gait that occur during pregnancy and in \n\npostpartum. The purpose of this review was to analyse the available evidence on the \n\nbiomechanical adaptations of gait that occur throughout pregnancy and in postpartum, \n\nspecifically with regard to the temporal, spatial, kinematic and kinetic parameters of \n\ngait. Three databases were searched and 9 studies with a follow-up design were \n\nretrieved for analysis. Most studies performed a temporal, spatial and kinematic \n\nanalysis. Only three studies performed a kinetic analysis. The adaptation strategies to \n\nthe anatomical and physiological changes throughout pregnancy are still unclear, \n\nparticularly in a longitudinal perspective and regarding kinetic parameters. \n\nKeywords: gait, pregnancy, biomechanics, review. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Biomechanics of gait during pregnancy: a review \n\n \n\n \n13 \n\n Introduction \n\nPregnancy is a unique time in the life of women with many changes that affect \n\nthe musculoskeletal system (Artal &amp; O'Toole, 2003). Over 38 to 42 weeks, women \n\nexperience several changes in the body's physiology, morphology and hormonal \n\nsystem. These changes are visible especially in increased weight and skeletal \n\nalignment. Other less visible changes are the increased joint laxity, and change in the \n\ncentre of gravity. Altogether, these changes affect the balance and body stability and \n\ncan cause discomfort and pain (Butler, Druzin, &amp; Sullivan, 2006). The displacement of \n\nthe centre of gravity has been discussed over the years with different statements. \n\nSome studies indicate that the centre of gravity (CG) moves upper and anteriorly (e.g., \n\nFoti et al., 2000; Rodacki, Fowler, Rodacki, &amp; Birch, 2003). Other studies state that the \n\nCG shifts on the upper and posterior direction (e.g., Fries &amp; Hellebrandt, 1943). \n\nWhitcome, Shapiro, and Lieberman (2007), evaluated the evolution of lumbar lordosis \n\nin bipedal hominids, and the results elucidate that the CG moves anteriorly until the \n\nfoetus reaches 40% of the expected final weight. From that moment, the woman \n\nincreases the lordotic adjustment which in turn enables the control of the CG, but with \n\ngreater biomechanical costs (Foti et al., 2000). \n\nHormonal changes in women are quite variable throughout pregnancy. \n\nHowever, the hormone relaxin may have a more decisive role in the mechanics of \n\nmovement, as it provides greater ligament laxity in the pelvis and on the peripheral \n\njoints (Butler et al., 2006; Calguneri, Bird, &amp; Wright, 1982; Schauberger et al., 1996). \n\nThe concentration peak of relaxin occurs around the 12th week of gestation, which \n\nmeans that there is enough time to act on osteoarticular structures until the end of \n\npregnancy. \n\nOne of the aspects that most influences the musculoskeletal system is the \n\nincrease in maternal weight. When weight is in excess it may cause several adverse \n\nmaternal effects, including gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, difficulties \n\nduring labour, weight retention in postpartum, and subsequent maternal obesity with \n\nthe risk for unsuccessful breastfeeding (Institute of Medicine and National Research \n\nCouncil of the National Academies, 2009). The ideal weight gain during pregnancy is \n\nrelated to the women's weight or body mass index (BMI) before pregnancy. The weight \n\ngain may range between 12.5 Kg and 18 Kg for women under weight (BMI &lt;18.5); \n\nbetween 11.5 Kg and 16 Kg for women with normal weight (18.5 ? BMI &lt;25); between \n\n7 Kg and 11.5 Kg for women who are overweight (25 ? BMI &lt;30) and; between 5 Kg \n\nand 9 Kg and for obese women (Institute of Medicine and National Research Council of \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Biomechanics of gait during pregnancy: a review \n\n \n\n \n14 \n\nthe National Academies, 2009). The weight gain during pregnancy is related to several \n\nfactors, such as, the amount of blood, the increased volume of the breasts, the \n\nincreased fat mass and extracellular fluid (Whitcome et al., 2007). The foetal tissues, \n\nthe placenta and the amniotic fluid are related to the weight gain of the foetus (Institute \n\nof Medicine and National Research Council of the National Academies, 2009). \n\nA strategy to control weight gain during pregnancy is by performing structured \n\nor recreational physical activity. The guidelines for exercise prescription of the \n\nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend aerobic exercise \n\nconsisting of activities that use large muscle groups in a continuous, rhythmic manner \n\n(Artal &amp; O'Toole, 2003). Walking emerges as a highly recommended physical activity \n\nfor pregnant women. Walking is one of the movements most commonly performed by \n\npeople in the day-to-day tasks and it is easy to control exercise intensity.  \n\nWhen performing motor tasks such as walking, the adaptations of the \n\nmusculoskeletal system due to morphological changes during pregnancy are not fully \n\nknown. Few studies clarify the biomechanical changes of gait that occur during \n\npregnancy and in postpartum.  \n\n \n\n Aim of the review  \n\nThe purpose of this review was to analyse the available evidence on the \n\nbiomechanical adaptations of gait that occur throughout pregnancy and in postpartum, \n\nspecifically with regard to the temporal, spatial, kinematic and kinetic parameters of \n\ngait.  \n\n \n\n Methods \n\n Eligibility criteria \n\nThe review was limited to studies meeting the following eligibility criteria: 1) \n\nhealthy pregnant women with no history of foot, ankle, knee, musculoskeletal or \n\nneuromuscular trauma or disease; 2) women aged between 20 and 40 years; 3) \n\nstudies performed in the last 14 years; 4) studies performed by means of optoelectronic \n\nsystems, image analysis, force platforms and others; 5) outcome measures related to \n\nbiomechanical variables of gait including, spatial (stride length, step length and stride \n\nwidth), temporal (single and double support time), kinematic (velocity and cadence), \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Biomechanics of gait during pregnancy: a review \n\n \n\n \n15 \n\nand kinetic (ground reaction forces, joint moment and joint power) parameters; 6) study \n\ndesign including cross-sectional, follow-up, quasi-experimental trials and randomized \n\ncontrolled trials. \n\n Information source \n\nThe studies were identified by searching three databases - ScienceDirect, \n\nPubMed and SciELO \u2013 from January 2000 to August 2014. In addition, reference lists \n\nof identified studies were also scanned. Studies published in English, Portuguese, \n\nSpanish or French were scanned. Only published full papers were included. \n\nUnpublished data, books, conference proceedings or academic theses were not \n\nincluded. \n\n Search strategy and study selection \n\n The search was performed using the following keywords in English: 1) gait / \n\nwalking; 2) pregnancy / pregnant; and 3) biomechanics / kinetics / kinematics. These \n\nkeywords were in first place identified in the titles and in the abstracts. The study \n\nselection was conducted in two stages. The first stage was the screening of the titles \n\nand abstracts against the inclusion criteria to identify relevant papers. The second \n\nstage was the screening of the full papers to identify whether they met the eligibility \n\ncriteria. \n\n Data collection process and analysis \n\nAfter screening each paper, the following data were extracted: 1) study design; \n\n2) sample size; 3) age of the women; 4) gestational phase of data collection; 5) \n\noutcome variables: spatial variables; temporal variables; kinematic variables; kinetic \n\nvariables; 6) biomechanical instruments. The studies were therefore described \n\naccording to these characteristics and outcome measures. \n\n Results \n\n Study selection and characteristics \n\nThe search yielded 741 articles from the three databases. ScienceDirect (711), \n\nPubMed (28) and SciELO (2). After removing duplicate articles 21 articles were \n\nconsidered for analysis. Articles were then screened on the basis of title and abstract, \n\nwith 16 excluded. After searching the reference lists of the selected articles, 4 more \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Biomechanics of gait during pregnancy: a review \n\n \n\n \n16 \n\narticles were included. The remaining 9 full papers were examined in detail and found \n\nto meet the inclusion criteria, and then, included in the review.  \n\nThe characteristics of the studies included in the review are presented in Table \n\n2. All studies have follow-up design. The sample sizes across the studies ranged from \n\n29 to 1247. All studies reported the mean age and standard deviation, except one \n\n(Lymbery &amp; Gilleard, 2005). Different studies used video-based systems for kinematic \n\nanalysis, except for two studies that use optoelectronic systems (Branco, Santos-\n\nRocha, Aguiar, Vieira, &amp; Veloso, 2013; Forczek &amp; Staszkiewicz, 2012), and one that \n\nonly uses pedometers (Falola et al., 2009) to analyse the temporal and spatial \n\nparameters. Only three studies report a kinetic analysis (Forczek &amp; Staszkiewicz, 2012; \n\nHagan &amp; Wong, 2010; Lymbery &amp; Gilleard, 2005) and most studies provide an analysis \n\nof the kinematic, spatial and temporal parameters. \n\nTable 2.

Most papers reviewed showed changes in spatial and temporal \n\nparameters in late pregnancy, specifically, a significant decrease in the length of the \n\ngait cycle (Branco et al., 2013; Carpes, Griebeler, Kleinpaul, Mann, &amp; Mota, 2008; W. \n\nL. Gilleard, 2013; Hagan &amp; Wong, 2010), and in step length (Branco et al., 2013; \n\nCarpes et al., 2008; Forczek &amp; Staszkiewicz, 2012; Hagan &amp; Wong, 2010), and a \n\nsignificant increase in the double support time (Branco et al., 2013; Carpes et al., 2008; \n\nFoti et al., 2000). Other studies showed a significant reduction in the single support \n\ntime (Carpes et al., 2008; Foti et al., 2000), and a significant increase in step width (W. \n\nL. Gilleard, 2013; Lymbery &amp; Gilleard, 2005). Forczek and Staszkiewicz (2012) also \n\nfound a significant increase in the base of support. Nevertheless, the remaining studies \n\nsuggest that pregnant women have the need to increase the body stability, and use the \n\nparameters listed above to meet those demands. \n\n Outcome measures: joint kinematics \n\nThe variables of velocity (or speed) and cadence are the kinematic parameters \n\nanalysed by the studies included in the review. Most papers reviewed showed changes \n\nin kinematic parameters in late pregnancy, specifically, a significant decrease in speed \n\n(Falola et al., 2009; Forczek &amp; Staszkiewicz, 2012; Hagan &amp; Wong, 2010) and a \n\nsignificant reduction in the gait cadence (Falola et al., 2009; Forczek &amp; Staszkiewicz, \n\n2012). \n\nThe joint kinematics of the lower limb, shows few changes throughout \n\npregnancy. The angular displacement of the pelvis increases in the anterior tilt of \n\napproximately five degrees (Foti et al., 2000; Hagan &amp; Wong, 2010). The joints of the \n\nlower limb in the sagittal plane shows an increase in hip flexion during stance phase \n\n(Branco et al., 2013; Foti et al., 2000; Hagan &amp; Wong, 2010), an increase of knee \n\nflexion during the terminal stance phase (Carpes et al., 2008), a decrease of knee \n\nextension (Branco et al., 2013), and a decrease of ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion \n\n(Branco et al., 2013; Hagan &amp; Wong, 2010). In the frontal plane, W. L. Gilleard (2013) \n\nfound a reduction in the amplitude of the unilateral elevation of the pelvis. The hip joint \n\nhad different results considering the two studies performed: Foti et al. (2000) found a \n\npeak with greater magnitude in the hip adduction; Branco et al. (2013) found a \n\ndecrease of this peak. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Biomechanics of gait during pregnancy: a review \n\n \n\n \n18 \n\n Outcome measures: joint kinetics \n\nFew studies have evaluated the kinetic parameters of gait during pregnancy. \n\nFoti et al. (2000) analysed the joint moments and joint powers with and without \n\nnormalizing the weight of the women in late pregnancy. Although they found several \n\nchanges in these parameters without normalization, the authors recommend the \n\nanalysis with normalization (Foti et al., 2000). The analyses performed with normalized \n\ndata found a significant increase in the hip extensors moment (Huang et al., 2002), and \n\na significant decrease in the knee extensors moment (Huang et al., 2002) and in the \n\nankle plantarflexors moment (Foti et al., 2000; Huang et al., 2002) in the sagittal plane. \n\nIn the frontal plane, there was an increase of the hip abductors moment (Foti et al., \n\n2000) and in the knee adductors moment (Huang et al., 2002). \n\n Discussion \n\nThe purpose of this review was to analyse the available evidence on the \n\nbiomechanical adaptations of gait that occur throughout pregnancy and in postpartum. \n\nData from 9 follow-up studies were included in the analysis.  \n\nWomen are subjected to various anatomical and physiological changes \n\nthroughout pregnancy. However the adaptation strategies that are pursued are still \n\nunclear (Forczek &amp; Staszkiewicz, 2012). Two of the situations they face are, on the one \n\nhand the reduction of energy costs associated with gait and, on the other hand, \n\nmaximizing safety during the motor task. The later strategy seems to be dominant \n\nbecause the increase in step width is associated with a greater energy cost while \n\nwalking (Donelan, Kram, &amp; Kuo, 2001). This parameter has great consistency between \n\nstudies. In addition, the development of pregnancy is associated with a reduction in \n\nstride length, which together allow the woman to have a larger base of support \n\n(Forczek &amp; Staszkiewicz, 2012). Other way found by pregnant women to ensure \n\ngreater body stability is keeping their feet on the ground for a longer time during the \n\ngait cycle and decreasing the single support time, which seems to be also a strategy to \n\nsupport the increased weight (Foti et al., 2000). In fact, the medial-lateral instability of \n\nthe women as the pregnancy progresses is one result that seems to have great \n\nimportance among different types of biomechanical parameters. However so far the \n\nmedial-lateral component of the ground reaction forces show no significant changes, \n\nbut tend to be higher in late pregnancy (Lymbery &amp; Gilleard, 2005). This observation \n\nrequires further research. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Biomechanics of gait during pregnancy: a review \n\n \n\n \n19 \n\nMuch of the biomechanical changes occur in the pelvis or in adjacent joints. \n\nAlthough there are few kinematic changes in late pregnancy, most of it are related to \n\nthe angular motion of the pelvis and the hip joint. The result with greater emphasis on \n\nstudies is the anterior tilt of the pelvis. The position taken by the pelvis in late \n\npregnancy seems to be a consequence of the weight of the uterus, placenta and foetus \n\nplaced in the anterior zone of the body, and the weaker capacity to produce force by \n\nthe rectus abdominis. However, the function of this anterior tilt and the increase of the \n\nlumbar lordosis is related to the maintenance of the trunk in an upright position (Foti et \n\nal., 2000). The decrease in the range of motion of the pelvis in the frontal and \n\ntransverse planes, suggests that this may be a way to control the angular momentum \n\ncaused by the increase of the moment of inertia of the trunk in late pregnancy (W. L. \n\nGilleard, 2013). These changes bring consequences for the muscles attached to the \n\npelvis, particularly a greater participation of the abductors and extensors muscles of the \n\nhip, which combined with a higher stretch derived from the anterior tilt of the pelvis, will \n\ncontribute to lower back, pelvis, hip and sacroiliac pain (Foti et al., 2000; Huang et al., \n\n2002). These types of pain are also associated with a decrease in the participation of \n\nthe knee extensors and ankle plantarflexors (Huang et al., 2002). The changes in \n\nangular motion of the ankle may also be associated with other issues of pregnant \n\nwomen, including a decrease of dorsiflexion that is related to pain and higher \n\nprobability to trip and fall (Hagan &amp; Wong, 2010). \n\n Limitations \n\nThe strength of this review is that a systematic methodology was adopted to \n\nidentify relevant studies on the biomechanics of gait during pregnancy. However, the \n\nreview has some limitations. Articles published in other languages than those \n\nmentioned above may have been excluded. The search was performed only in peer-\n\nreviewed published articles since 2000. There is a possibility of missing data published \n\npreviously or other unpublished data, which were not included in the analysis. The \n\nsmall sample sizes and the different periods of data collection may have introduced \n\nsome bias in the analysis performed. The lack of studies on this subject as well as the \n\nconsistency of the outcome measures is a major limitation to perform a meta-analysis. \n\nCautions should be taken when drawings conclusions about gait adaptations \n\nthroughout pregnancy, due to the limitations mentioned above. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Biomechanics of gait during pregnancy: a review \n\n \n\n \n20 \n\n Conclusions \n\nThe evidence from this review suggests biomechanical adaptations of gait \n\nthroughout pregnancy. Further research is required using common outcome measures \n\nand standard follow-up periods of data collection (weeks of gestation and postpartum \n\nperiod). Most of the results presented in this review are consistent between studies. \n\nHowever there is a great scarcity of studies addressing the gait biomechanics of \n\npregnant women in a longitudinal perspective. There is a need to examine the \n\nkinematics of the woman closely while walking considering the beginning of pregnancy, \n\nin order to confirm the influence of morphological changes in the angular motion of the \n\nlower limb segments during the course of pregnancy.  \n\nVery few studies analysed the kinetics of gait of pregnant women. Nevertheless, \n\nthese data are seen as essential to understand the magnitude and implications of \n\nchanges in the welfare of women. In future research, there must be a special focus on \n\nthe analysis of moments and joint powers to understand the changes in muscle \n\nparticipation, and if there are changes in the type of contraction during motor tasks. \n\nIt is not possible to understand the influence of morphological changes, if body \n\ncomposition and anthropometric variables are not quantified throughout pregnancy. \n\nFurther research is required to understand to which extent these variables influence the \n\nbiomechanical parameters. \n\nNo studies were found addressing the effects of physical activity, low back and \n\npelvic pain or maternal weight control on the gait biomechanical adaptations of gait \n\nthroughout pregnancy and postpartum. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Biomechanics of gait during pregnancy: a review \n\n \n\n \n21 \n\n References \n\nArtal, R., &amp; O'Toole, M.

A three-dimensional \n\nanalysis was performed in 11 pregnant women. Repeated measures were performed \n\nfor comparisons between periods. The longitudinal effect of pregnancy was not \n\nobserved in spatial and temporal parameters, but trends such as stride width during \n\npregnancy and postpartum were observed. In joint kinematics the effect of pregnancy \n\nwas observed in all joints for the three planes of motion. The hip joint and the segment \n\nof the pelvis are structures with more changes, and the results suggest an increase in \n\nthe anterior tilt of the pelvis as pregnancy progresses, a decrease of the amplitude of \n\nthe hip joint, and that pregnant women need to maintain their body stability to become \n\nmore efficient in terms of locomotion. Generally, the results confirm retrieval of the \n\nvalues from the beginning of pregnancy, indicating that the body self-organizes in order \n\nto overcome the morphological and physiological changes which women suffer during \n\npregnancy, that women have the ability to adapt to such demands, and that when the \n\neffect of pregnancy subsides they retrieve values similar to those found in early \n\npregnancy. \n\nKeywords: Gait, pregnancy, kinematics, spatial parameters, temporal \n\nparameters \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 3D kinematic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum \n\n \n\n \n25 \n\n \n\n Introduction \n\nPregnant women undergo various changes during pregnancy, including \n\nhormonal and morphological changes (A.C.O.G., 2010). Although, these changes may \n\nlead to many complaints, discomfort and pain in lower limbs, it is unclear whether the \n\nbiological, hormonal and morphological changes lead to the modification of gait pattern. \n\nFew studies describe the temporal, spatial and kinematic motion on the lower limb of \n\nthe pregnant women, particularly in a longitudinal perspective. \n\nFoti et al. (2000) analysed a set of gait three-dimensional (3D) kinematic \n\nparameter in 15 women, from the 3th trimester of pregnancy until one year postpartum. \n\nThe overall results showed changes in the gait pattern of those women, comparing with \n\na non-pregnant group. In the pregnant group gait pattern the amplitude of hip extension \n\nis decreased while the anterior pelvic tilt, hip flexion and hip adduction are increased. \n\nRegarding temporal parameters significant increases were found in double support \n\ntime and significant decreases in single support time. In spatial parameters they found \n\na significant increase in pelvic width and ankle separation. Lymbery and Gilleard (2005) \n\ninvestigated the temporospatial and ground reaction forces (GRF) variables in the \n\nstance phase of walking in 13 women at 38 weeks\u2019 gestation and 8 weeks after birth. \n\nThey concluded that in late pregnancy, there was a wider step width, and mediolateral \n\nGRF is increasing in a medial direction. They suggested that women may adapt their \n\ngait to maximize stability in the stance phase of walking and to control mediolateral \n\nmotion. Huang et al. (2002) compared the natural pattern of walking, tested once, in 10 \n\npregnant women, divided into three groups (12, 13-28 and 29-40 weeks of gestation) \n\nwith of control group of 10 nulliparous. They reported significant differences between \n\nthe pregnant and non-pregnant women, especially in knee abduction angle, knee and \n\nhip internal rotation angles. Also, as gestational age progress, the pregnant women \n\nshowed increased in hip extension moment and knee adduction moment, and \n\ndecreased in knee extension moment, and ankle plantar flexion moment. According to \n\nthese authors the hip is the main work-loading area, associated with an over stretch of \n\nthe hip extensors, which are highly related to sacroiliac pain, caused by an easily \n\nfatigue of these muscles. \n\nFew studies analysed gait kinematic changes throughout pregnancy, in each \n\ntrimester of gestation, or associated the kinematic and kinetic variables for each phase \n\nof the gait cycle. In a previous study Branco et al. (2013) found that the gait pattern of \n\npregnant women showed changes between second and third trimesters in such a way \n\nthat the stride and right and left step lengths decreased, while double limb support time \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 3D kinematic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum \n\n \n\n \n26 \n\nincreased. Joint kinematics showed a significant decrease of right-hip extension and \n\nadduction during stance phase between trimesters. Also, an increase in left knee \n\nflexion and a decrease in right-ankle plantarflexion were found between trimesters. \n\nNo studies were found performing a longitudinal analysis encompassing the \n\nthree trimesters of pregnancy and the postpartum period, so that the changes that are \n\narising from pregnancy are not fully quantified. These leads us to wonder whether there \n\nare changes in kinematic parameters during pregnancy, and if so, are women able to \n\nrecover to values close to those found in early pregnancy? \n\n Objectives  \n\nThe main objective of this study was to analyse the kinematic changes of gait \n\nas the pregnancy progresses. If these changes were confirmed, the second objective \n\nwas to ascertain whether women can recover to the initial kinematic patterns in the \n\npostpartum period. The hypothesis tested is that the gait of pregnant women has \n\nchanges in the kinematic parameters throughout their pregnancy, and women in \n\npostpartum period recover these parameters to values similar to those of early \n\npregnancy. To achieve the main objective, it is necessary to describe the kinematic \n\nvariables in the joints of the lower limb during gait at the end of the first, second and \n\nthird trimesters of pregnancy and in the postpartum period. \n\n \n\n Materials and Methods \n\n Subjects \n\nEleven pregnant women (age: 33.20 \u00b1 1.62 years; range: 32 to 37 years) with \n\nno trauma or disease history regarding foot, ankle, knee, musculoskeletal, and \n\nneuromuscular tissue participated in this study. The characteristics of the participants \n\nare described in Table 3. \n\nTable 3. Characteristics of the sample data for weight, body mass index (BMI) and gestational weeks, in each collection \nphase. \n\n 1st Trimester 2nd Trimester 3rd Trimester Postpartum \n\nWeight (kg) 61.1 \u00b1 6.6 66.6 \u00b1 8.5 71 \u00b1 8.0 62.4 \u00b1 7.4 \n\nBMI (kg.m2) 22.7 \u00b1 2.7 24.7 \u00b1 3.6 26.4 \u00b1 3.4 23.2 \u00b1 3.3 \n\nWeeks 14.2 \u00b1 2.4 27.3 \u00b1 1 36.3 \u00b1 0.9 20.6 \u00b1 5.2 \n\nPregnant participants were recruited via direct contact and flyers placed in gym \n\nand health centres and volunteered to participate in the study. None of the participants \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 3D kinematic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum \n\n \n\n \n27 \n\n \n\nhad contraindications for physical exercise. The study was approved by the ethical \n\ncommittee of the Faculty of Human Kinetics, University of Lisbon (FMH-UL) and all \n\nsubjects gave written informed consent prior to their participation in the study. \n\n \n\n Data Collection and Processing \n\nData were collected at the Laboratory of Biomechanics and Functional \n\nMorphology (FMH-UL) during the later stages of each trimester of pregnancy and once \n\nin the postpartum period. In each data collection session anthropometric and \n\nbiomechanical data were recorded. Weight and height were measured  according to \n\nthe International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK) \n\nstandardized measurement protocol (Stewart, Marfell-Jones, Olds, &amp; de Ridder, 2011) \n\nby ISAK certified anthropometrists. These anthropometric data were used to calculate \n\nthe body segment mass and inertia moments.  \n\nThe biomechanical data were recorded while the subject walked barefoot a \n\ndistance of 10 m, between two points, in a straight line in both directions at a natural \n\nand comfortable speed for 3 min. The floor had no specific patterns or irregularities, \n\nand the participants had no knowledge of the location of the force platforms, which \n\nwere placed in the middle of the defined distance. Participants were allowed to become \n\nfamiliar with the laboratory system and no fatigue occurrence was reported. The last \n\nfour gait cycles performed by each participant were considered for the analysis. \n\nThe marker set-up follows the recommendation of Cappozzo et al. (1997) for \n\nlower limb segments and CODA (Charnwood Dynamics Ltd, Leicestershire, United \n\nKingdom) protocols for models of the pelvis segment. In the static trial for the foot \n\nmodel, reflective spherical markers were placed on the fifth metatarsal head, the first \n\nmetatarsal head, the posterior proximal top of the calcaneus, the posterior distal top of \n\nthe calcaneus, and the lateral top of the calcaneus. For shank model construction, \n\nmarkers were placed on the lateral malleolus, medial malleolus, lateral femoral \n\nepicondyle, and medial femoral epicondyle and a cluster with three markers was \n\nplaced in the lateral of the shank. For the thigh model construction, markers were \n\nplaced on the lateral femoral epicondyle, and medial femoral epicondyle and a cluster \n\nwith three markers was placed in the lateral of the thigh (Figure 1). To define the CODA \n\npelvis model, markers were placed in both the anterior superior iliac spine and the \n\nposterior superior iliac spine. The pelvis model allowed the estimation of the right and \n\nleft hip joint centre with the regression equation proposed by Bell and colleagues (Bell \n\net al., 1989; Bell et al., 1990). For the dynamic trials, at least three markers were left in \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 3D kinematic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum \n\n \n\n \n28 \n\neach segment as reference to static marker set-up, in order to allow segment \n\nreconstruction. The angular displacement of the hip, knee and ankle joint was \n\ncalculated with Visual 3D (V3D) software (C-Motion Inc., Germantown, USA) through \n\nthe application of the Euler method. \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Reconstructed biomechanical model in Visual 3D with marker setup used for motion captures. Anterior and \nlateral view of the model. \n\nKinematic and kinetic data were collected by means of 12 infrared high-speed \n\ncameras (Oqus-300, Qualisys, Sweden; FR: 500 Hz), two Kistler force platforms \n\n(Kistler AG, Winterthur, Switzerland) and one AMTI platform (Advanced Mechanical \n\nTechnology, Inc., Watertown, U.S.A.), at a rate of 1000 Hz. The capture hardware was \n\nconnected to a Qualisys USB Analog Acquisition interface in order to synchronize \n\nkinetic and kinematic data with software Qualisys Track Manager (QTM; Qualisys AB, \n\nGothenburg, Sweden). Both data sequences were recorded in the same file. The \n\nsystem was calibrated by wand type, with an exact wand length of 751.4 mm moved \n\nrandomly across the recorded field before the data collection of each participant. \n\nCalibration was accepted if the standard deviation of the wand length measures was \n\nbelow 0.5 mm. The cameras were positioned statically to minimize light reflection \n\nartefacts and to allow recording of at least two consecutive walking cycles, defined as \n\nthe time between two consecutive initial ground contacts of the heel strike for each \n\nside.  \n\nA three-dimensional analysis was performed which included both sides of the \n\nbody. The trajectory of the reflective markers was smoothed with a Butterworth low-\n\npass filter with a 10 Hz cut-off. Collected data were interpolated by means of cubic \n\nspline interpolation as suggested by Robertson et al. (2014), for a maximum 10-frame \n\ngap, and filtered with a Butterworth digital low-pass filter, at 10 Hz cut-off frequency for \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 3D kinematic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum \n\n \n\n \n29 \n\n \n\nkinematic and kinetic data, as suggested by Robertson and Dowling (2003). All data \n\nwere normalized in time. \n\nConsidering the four phases in the analysis, kinematic pattern curves were \n\nestimated relative to the walking stride cycle. The gait cycles were based on GRF data \n\nfor both feet and the heel marker pattern recognition followed by correction when \n\nneeded. The data curves and the peak angles values were estimated, for left and right \n\nsides, with Visual 3D software (V3D). Lower-extremity joint angles and spatial and \n\ntemporal parameters during the walking gait cycle were calculated with the use of V3D. \n\nIn the three periods of pregnancy and in the postpartum, the following variables \n\nwere analysed in the sagittal plane:  \n\n? the pelvic tilt, defined by two peaks representing the maximum anterior \n\ntilt occurring at the terminal stance phase and the minimum anterior tilt \n\nwhich occurred at the mid-swing phase;  \n\n? in the hip joint two peaks were considered, the first representing the \n\nmaximum hip extension which occurs in the toe-off event, and the \n\nsecond some moments before heel strike and representing the \n\nmaximum hip flexion;  \n\n? in the knee joint four peaks were considered, the first after the heel \n\nstrike and representing a slight flexion to absorb the contact with the \n\nfloor; the second representing the slight knee extension near the late \n\nmid-stance phase; the third peak occurred in the mid-swing phase as \n\nthe maximum knee flexion; and the fourth peak represented the \n\nmaximum extension of the knee, and occurred immediately before heel \n\nstrike;  \n\n? in the ankle joint four peaks were considered, the first immediately after \n\nheel strike with a sudden decrease of dorsiflexion of the foot; the second \n\npeak occurred approximately at contralateral heel strike; the third peak \n\nindicated the maximum plantar flexion at toe-off event with a decrease of \n\nplantar flexion; and the fourth peak occurred in mid-swing phase, and \n\nrepresented the maximum dorsiflexion of the foot in preparation for \n\ncontact with the ground. \n\nThe following variables were analysed in the frontal plane:  \n\n? in the hip joint two peaks were considered, the first in the mid-stance \n\nphase representing the maximum value of hip adduction; and the \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 3D kinematic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum \n\n \n\n \n30 \n\nsecond after the toe-off event and representing the maximum value of \n\nhip abduction; \n\n? in the ankle joint four peaks were considered, the first in mid-stance in \n\nthe maximum ankle eversion phase; the second represented the \n\nmaximum value of ankle inversion during toe-off event; the third \n\noccurred in the mid-swing phase close to the neutral position; and the \n\nfourth peak occurred immediately at the end of the swing phase in \n\ninversion.  \n\nThe following variables were analysed in the transverse plane:  \n\n? in the hip joint two peaks were considered, the first representing the \n\nmaximum value of internal rotation and occurring immediately before the \n\ntoe-off event; the second peak represented the maximum value of \n\nexternal rotation and it occurred in a late swing phase; \n\n? in the ankle joint two peaks were considered, the first at the beginning of \n\nthe mid-stance phase, and the second in the mid-swing phase. \n\nThe following spatial and temporal variables were analysed: speed, cycle time, \n\nright and left step time, double limb support time, right and left stance time, right and \n\nleft swing time, right and left step length, stride length and stride width.  \n\n Statistical Analysis \n\nAll statistical procedures were conducted with IBM SPSS Statistics 22 software \n\nfor Windows. Shapiro-Wilk normality tests were conducted and not assumed for all \n\ncases. The Mauchly\u2019s test of sphericity was performed before repeated measures \n\nANOVA analysis and sphericity was not assumed in all tests. For post hoc tests, \n\nBonferroni test based on Student's t statistic was used, and the observed significance \n\nlevel was adjusted to take multiple comparisons into account. When the data set does \n\nnot fulfil the assumptions for the RM analysis, the Friedman test was performed, and \n\nfor pairwise analysis the Wilcoxon test was performed. In this case, Bonferroni \n\nconfidence interval adjustment was applied to allow an adjustment to the confidence \n\nintervals and significance values for multiple comparisons. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 3D kinematic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum \n\n \n\n \n31 \n\n \n\n Results \n\n Spatial and Temporal parameters \n\nThe longitudinal effect of pregnancy was not observed in any spatial or temporal \n\nparameter (Table 4), regarding the results of the statistical tests.  \n\nTable 4 - Spatial and temporal parameters (mean\u00b1sd) of gait during pregnancy and in the postpartum period (N=11). \n\n First \nTrimester \n\nSecond \nTrimester \n\nThird \nTrimester \n\nPostpartum \n\nMean \u00b1 Std. \nDev. \n\nMean \u00b1 Std. \nDev. \n\nMean \u00b1 Std. \nDev. \n\nMean \u00b1 Std. \nDev. \n\nSpeed (m/s) 1.215 \u00b1 0.182 1.222 \u00b1 0.164 1.154 \u00b1 0.165 1.267 \u00b1 0.226 \n\nRight Step Length (m) 0.638 \u00b1 0.067 0.642 \u00b1 0.059 0.626 \u00b1 0.053 0.653 \u00b1 0.077 \n\nLeft Step Length (m) 0.639 \u00b1 0.064 0.640 \u00b1 0.056 0.620 \u00b1 0.056 0.649 \u00b1 0.071 \n\nStride Length (m) 1.277 \u00b1 0.131 1.282 \u00b1 0.113 1.246 \u00b1 0.107 1.301 \u00b1 0.147 \n\nStride Width (m) 0.089 \u00b1 0.024 0.096 \u00b1 0.028 0.103 \u00b1 0.029 0.095 \u00b1 0.026 \n\nCycle Time (s) 1.058 \u00b1 0.069 1.056 \u00b1 0.065 1.089 \u00b1 0.076 1.039 \u00b1 0.081 \n\nRight Step Time (s) 0.531 \u00b1 0.036 0.525 \u00b1 0.031 0.542 \u00b1 0.041 0.515 \u00b1 0.040 \n\nLeft Step Time (s) 0.527 \u00b1 0.035 0.535 \u00b1 0.036 0.544 \u00b1 0.036 0.524 \u00b1 0.044 \n\nDouble Limb Support Time (s) 0.201 \u00b1 0.038 0.205 \u00b1 0.033 0.220 \u00b1 0.035 0.198 \u00b1 0.045 \n\nRight Stance  (s)Time 0.628 \u00b1 0.053 0.636 \u00b1 0.050 0.656 \u00b1 0.053 0.620 \u00b1 0.067 \n\nLeft Stance Time (s) 0.631 \u00b1 0.052 0.622 \u00b1 0.048 0.652 \u00b1 0.055 0.616 \u00b1 0.060 \n\nRight Swing Time (s) 0.429 \u00b1 0.022 0.425 \u00b1 0.021 0.434 \u00b1 0.028 0.419 \u00b1 0.021 \n\nLeft Swing Time (s) 0.428 \u00b1 0.019 0.430 \u00b1 0.023 0.436 \u00b1 0.023 0.424 \u00b1 0.021  \n\nAlthough these parameters did not show statistically significant changes, the \n\nparameters showed a slight increase during pregnancy, particularly for double support \n\ntime, left step time, single support time, and the left swing phase.

From the second and third trimesters to postpartum, there continued to be a \n\nsignificant increase. These increases were between two and three degrees of internal \n\nrotation of the hip. \n\n Discussion \n\nThe main goal of this longitudinal study was to describe the changes in the gait \n\nbiomechanical parameters throughout pregnancy and in the postpartum period. The 3D \n\nanalysis of kinematic parameters as well as of spatial and temporal parameters was \n\nperformed. The hypothesis that these parameters are influenced by the course of \n\npregnancy is rejected for the spatial and temporal variables during walking, and \n\naccepted for the kinematic variables in the three planes of motion. In our previous \n\nstudy (Branco et al., 2013) and in Foti et al. (2000) found higher values in the stride \n\nwidth and in the double support time for third trimester, when compared to the values \n\nfound in the postpartum or in control group, respectively, and are largely influenced by \n\nthe stage of pregnancy. However, even without significant changes in this study, the \n\nstride width was 1.4 cm larger in the third trimester than in early pregnancy, and \n\ndecreases in postpartum, and the double support time also features the inverted U-\n\nshaped, with an increase of 0.17 seconds between the first and the third trimesters and \n\na decrease from the third trimester to postpartum of 0.20 seconds, which seems to \n\npoint to the same behaviour as the literature. A possible explanation for discrepancies \n\nin the results between our study and literature may be due to sample size. \n\nThe kinematic parameters in the three planes of motion are influenced by the \n\nprogression of pregnancy, checking for deviations in several angular data of the lower \n\nlimb joints. In the sagittal plane, the knee, hip, and the segment of the pelvis present \n\nthe major changes during pregnancy. There are few studies in the literature that \n\nreferred knee changes during pregnancy and postpartum. Our results are in line with \n\nCarpes et al. (2008) that found a significant increase in knee flexion in the terminal \n\nstance phase, and with our previous study (Branco et al., 2013). We also found a \n\ndecrease in knee extension at the end of swing phase, which may be the result of a \n\nlower participation of the knee extensors. This may be associated to back pain, \n\nspecifically with sacroiliac pain, referred by pregnant women (Huang et al., 2002).  \n\nThe hip joint has been referenced in the literature as the joint where major \n\nchanges occur in late pregnancy. In our study an increase in flexion of the hip during \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 3D kinematic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum \n\n \n\n \n38 \n\nstance phase was found which is supported by previous studies (Branco et al., 2013; \n\nFoti et al., 2000; Hagan &amp; Wong, 2010), leaving effectively no peak of hip extension \n\nduring pre-swing phase.  \n\nThe published results about the pelvis are consistent across the studies, \n\nshowing an increased anterior tilt of five degrees throughout the gait cycle (Foti et al., \n\n2000; Hagan &amp; Wong, 2010). In this study, in addition to assessing the significant \n\nincrease in this anterior tilt, we discriminated that this increase occurs, between the first \n\nand second trimesters and remained similar between the second and third trimesters, \n\nas previously observed (Branco et al., 2013). This pelvis position, seems to agree with \n\nthe morphological changes already undertaken by pregnant women at the end of the \n\nsecond trimester, where there are an increase in abdominal volume and weight of the \n\nfoetus that affects about 40% of its final weight (Whitcome et al., 2007), combined with \n\na lower capacity for force production by rectus abdominis. However, Foti et al. (2000) \n\nstate that the function of the anterior pelvic tilt, combined with an increase of lumbar \n\nlordosis is to keep the body in an upright position. After delivery, between the fourth \n\nand sixth months, there is a significant reduction in the pelvic anterior tilt angle similar \n\nto those found in the first trimester which seems to be an indicator of the recovery of \n\nthe pelvis position in postpartum, also observed in the literature between pregnancy \n\nand the postpartum (Branco et al., 2013; Foti et al., 2000; Hagan &amp; Wong, 2010). \n\nRegarding the sagittal plane, the results confirmed that the angular data show \n\ndeviations associated with pregnancy and are recovered in the postpartum period. \n\nIn the frontal plane, there are influences of the stage of pregnancy on the \n\nangular data, revealing significant changes in the ankle, hip and pelvis segment. Few \n\nstudies have examined the frontal plane changes. Gilleard (2013) found a reduction in \n\nthe amplitude of the unilateral elevation of the pelvis. In this study, during the mid-\n\nstance, there was an increase of the magnitude of the fall of the pelvis from the third \n\ntrimester to the postpartum period. During the toe-off, the pelvis shows a slight \n\ndecrease in elevation between the first and second trimesters, and an increased \n\nelevation of the pelvis between the first and the third trimesters. Both results suggest \n\nthat, in late pregnancy, the dynamic of the two angular peaks of the pelvis is related to \n\nthe attempt to control the angular momentum of the trunk caused by the increase of its \n\nmoment of inertia (Gilleard, 2013). In the hip joint, this study showed a decrease in the \n\nhip adduction during the mid-stance phase, between the first and third trimesters. In a \n\nprevious study, (Branco et al., 2013) we found similar results between the second and \n\nthird trimesters and between pregnant and non-pregnant women. However, Foti et al. \n\n(2000) point to a contradictory result, showing an increase in hip adduction between \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 3D kinematic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum \n\n \n\n \n39 \n\n \n\nparticipants at the end of pregnancy and one year after delivery. The ankle joint \n\nshowed no changes in the frontal plane in the literature (Branco et al., 2013). In this \n\nstudy, however, there are significant changes in the pre-swing phase, with an increase \n\nof ankle inversion from the first to the third trimester and to the postpartum period, \n\nshowing that this parameter does not recover and remains at least up to six months \n\nafter delivery. The ankle inversion between the first and third trimesters keeps \n\nsignificantly increased until the mid-swing phase, showing that both stances as the \n\nswing phases of the pregnant woman are with an increased inversion of the foot during \n\npregnancy. Since the changes only occur between the first and third trimester, and \n\nremain in the postpartum, justifies the fact that it has not been found in previous \n\nstudies, which only studied women since the end of the second trimester. In the frontal \n\nplane, the hypothesis that the data show angular deviations associated with pregnancy, \n\nis accepted for the above variables. However, the hypothesis that these variables \n\nretake the values of early pregnancy is not accepted only for the inversion of the ankle, \n\nwhich keeps increased up to the postpartum period. \n\nThe kinematic parameters in transverse plane remain largely unchanged during \n\npregnancy and postpartum, however there is an increase in the hip internal rotation \n\nfrom the first to the second and to the third trimester. In the postpartum period there is \n\na continuous increase in internal rotation during the terminal stance phase. According \n\nto Los Amigos Research Education Institute Inc et al. (2001), the internal rotation of the \n\nhip during the single support, is associated with an internal rotation contracture, \n\nfemoral anteversion or an intention to increase knee stability, leading to a toe-in \n\nposition, hindering the forward advancement and may increase pressure on the lateral \n\nside of the knee joint. Regarding transverse plane, the hypothesis that the data show \n\nangular deviations associated with pregnancy, is rejected for most variables except for \n\ninternal rotation of the hip. This variable, however, does not return the values of early \n\npregnancy, rejecting that hypothesis, by remaining increased until the last moment of \n\ncollection. \n\n Conclusions \n\nThis study followed a descriptive longitudinal type design, in which pregnant \n\nwomen were assessed in the first, second and third trimesters of pregnancy and also in \n\nthe postpartum period. The gait analysis showed that pregnancy is a factor which \n\ninfluences the kinematic variables of the lower limb joints. The pelvis and hip joint are \n\nthe segments that experience greater changes throughout pregnancy. Changes in the \n\nsagittal plane indicate that there is greater care in the anterior progression of the body. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 3D kinematic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum \n\n \n\n \n40 \n\nHowever the temporal and spatial data reveal no significant changes over the gait \n\ncycle. In the remaining planes of motion, there is less amplitude of motor actions, which \n\nseem to indicate greater constraints on movement. In general the results retrieve the \n\nvalues from the beginning of pregnancy, indicating that the body was self-organized in \n\norder to overcome the morphological and physiological changes which women suffer \n\nduring pregnancy and that has the ability to adapt depending on the demands. Other \n\nquestions are raised by these results, in particular if these kinematic changes bring an \n\noverload to the musculoskeletal system of the pregnant woman and its association with \n\nlumbopelvic pain.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 3D kinematic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum \n\n \n\n \n41 \n\n \n\n References \n\nA.C.O.G.

(Appendix 2) \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 3D kinetic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum \n\n \n\n \n44 \n\n Abstract \n\nPregnant women experience several adaptations in morphology and physiology \n\nthroughout pregnancy. Some of the biomechanical adaptations that occur result in \n\nchanges in gait pattern and daily task performance. These changes may also \n\ncontribute to musculoskeletal overuse conditions such as low-back and pelvic pain. \n\nHowever, the biomechanical adaptations of gait remain only partially understood. The \n\npurpose of this study was prospectively to describe and compare the kinetic \n\nparameters in the joints of the lower limb during gait at the end of the first, second and \n\nthird trimesters of pregnancy and in the postpartum period in healthy pregnant women. \n\nA three-dimensional analysis was performed by 11 participants. Repeated measures \n\nwere performed for comparisons between periods. The main results show a reduction \n\nin vertical reaction forces, as the pregnancy advances, indicating a smaller downward \n\nacceleration for the advancement of the body, as well as the transmission of weight. \n\nPregnant women showed during most of the stance phase medial reaction forces as a \n\nmotor response to promote body stability. Several changes were observed in the lower \n\nlimb kinetics, most of which showed a decrease in the different planes of motion for all \n\njoints, including the participation of the flexors and extensors of the thigh and its \n\neccentric contraction, and decreases in the production of the mechanical energy of \n\nknee extensors, the participation of ankle plantar flexors, and the eccentric contraction \n\nof the ankle abductors. Only one parameter showed an increase of the mechanical \n\nload of the hip joint, whereby there were significant increases in the participation of the \n\nexternal hip rotator. In conclusion, the joint which undergoes the most evident changes \n\nis the hip. The generality of the results points to biomechanical adjustments that show \n\na decrease of the mechanical load of women throughout pregnancy in order to avoid \n\nstrong interaction with the ground.  \n\nKeywords: Gait, pregnancy, kinetics. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Kinetic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum \n\n \n\n \n45 \n\n \n\n Introduction \n\nDuring the normal development of pregnancy, women experience a variety of \n\nmorphological and physiological changes, as well as a continuous increase in body \n\nweight (A.C.O.G., 2010; Institute of Medicine and National Research Council of the \n\nNational Academies, 2009). However, it is not fully described the dynamics of the load \n\nthat women experience, and how this weight gain influence everyday tasks, such as \n\nwalking. Walking is widely used not only as a mean of locomotion, but also as a mode \n\nof exercise, especially recommended throughout pregnancy and without \n\ncontraindications for pregnant women (Artal &amp; O'Toole, 2003).  \n\nThe ground reaction forces (GRF) have been widely studied in the \n\ncharacterization of walking, however only in the last two decades these parameters \n\nwere studied in pregnant women. The importance of these parameters to investigate \n\nthe stability and possible causes of falls in pregnant women has been the focus of \n\nrecent studies. Lymbery and Gilleard (2005) concluded that in late pregnancy the \n\nmediolateral GRF tended to be increased in a medial direction along with a wider step \n\nwidth, suggesting that women may adapt their gait to maximize stability in the stance \n\nphase of walking and to control mediolateral motion. Branco, Santos-Rocha, Vieira, \n\nAguiar, and Veloso (In press) in a previous study, analysed the tri-dimensional \n\nadaptations of kinetic parameters between the second and third trimester of twenty four \n\npregnancy women and with a control group. Most of the results reveal significant \n\nchanges between pregnancy stages and non-pregnant group, reporting a decrease of \n\nthe mechanical load of pregnant women, specifically with a lower magnitude in the third \n\npeak of vertical GRF and in the second peak of anterior component of GRF, and most \n\nof the stance phase has a medial GRF. According to Abu Osman and Mat Ghazali \n\n(2002) and McCrory, Chambers, Daftary, and Redfern (2011) no changes were found \n\nfor GRF in the collected groups. However, in most studies only the last stages of \n\npregnancy were considered (exception for (Abu Osman and Mat Ghazali (2002); Inanir, \n\nCakmak, Hisim, and Demirturk (2014)), not getting clearly defined if there is any \n\ninfluence of pregnancy condition on these variables, and if these changes happen \n\ngradually from the beginning of pregnancy. Such as the GRF, the joint kinetics is \n\nmostly studied in the last two trimesters of pregnancy or between the end of pregnancy \n\nand postpartum (with exception for the study of Huang et al. (2002)). Foti et al. (2000) \n\nregarding this analysis, reported significant increases in hip and ankle kinetics during \n\npregnancy. Their findings show that during pregnancy there may be an increased \n\ndemand placed on the hip abductors, hip extensors, and ankle plantarflexors muscles \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 3D kinetic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum \n\n \n\n \n46 \n\nduring walking. Branco et al. (In press) analyse the tri-dimensional adaptations of \n\nkinetic parameters between the second and third trimester of twenty four pregnancy \n\nwomen and with a control group. Most of the changes reveal significant changes \n\nbetween pregnancy stages and non-pregnant group. In the joint moments they found a \n\ndecrease in hip flexors, knee extensors, ankle dorsiflexors, and ankle evertors\u2019 \n\nmoment, and an increase in the participation of hip external rotators during loading \n\nresponse phase of pregnant women. In the joint powers they found significant \n\ndecreases in the absorption of mechanical energy of hip flexors, and significant \n\ndecreases in the production of mechanical energy of the hip abductors and in the ankle \n\nplantarflexors. An increase in the production of mechanical energy was found for hip \n\nextensors and hip external rotators. Huang et al. (2002) compared the gait pattern of \n\nnon-pregnant and pregnant women divided into three groups, respectively: 12 weeks, \n\n13-28 weeks, and 29-40 weeks of gestation, which were tested only once. They \n\nreported significant differences between the pregnant and non-pregnant women, \n\nespecially in knee abduction angle, knee and hip internal rotation angles, hip extension \n\nmoment, and hip power. Also, as gestational age increased, the pregnant group \n\nincreased hip extension moment, decreased knee extension moment, increased knee \n\nadduction moment and decreased ankle plantar flexion moment. It is not clear \n\nhowever, in the different studies (with exception of Branco et al. (In press)), if these \n\nchanges occur bilaterally, occur only unilaterally, or correspond to an average values \n\nbetween sides. \n\n Objectives  \n\nThus, the main purpose of this study was to assess the gait kinetics, in order to \n\ncheck if there are any changes in the dynamics of the load of women from the \n\nbeginning of pregnancy until the postpartum period. To achieve the main objective, it \n\nwas necessary to describe and quantify the kinetic variables, regarding to GRF, joints \n\nmoment of force and joints power, of ankle, knee and hip, during gait, at the end of the \n\nfirst, second and third trimesters of pregnancy and in the postpartum period. \n\nWe tested the hypothesis that the GRF, joints moment and joints power \n\nparameters exhibit deviations along the pregnancy and are associated to this special \n\nphase of life, which are recovered in the postpartum period. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Kinetic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum \n\n \n\n \n47 \n\n \n\n Materials and Methods \n\n Subjects \n\nEleven pregnant women, aged between 32 and 37 years (33.20 \u00b1 1.62 years) \n\nand with no history of foot, ankle, knee, musculoskeletal, and neuromuscular trauma or \n\ndisease, participated in this study. The characteristics of weight and weeks of gestation \n\nin the four periods of data collection were: 1) first trimester: 61.1 \u00b1 6.6 kg and 14.2 \u00b1 \n\n2.4 wk; 2) second trimester: 66.6 \u00b1 8.5 kg and 27.3 \u00b1 1.0 wk; 3) third trimester: 71.0 \u00b1 \n\n8.0 kg and 36.3 \u00b1 0.9 wk; and, 4) postpartum period: 62.4 \u00b1 7.4 kg and 20.6 \u00b1 5.2 wk. \n\nThe participants were recruited via direct contact and flyers placed in gym and \n\nhealth centres and volunteered to participate in the study. None of the participants had \n\ncontraindications regarding physical exercise. All subjects gave written informed \n\nconsent prior to their participation in the study.  \n\n Data Collection and Processing \n\nThe study was approved by the ethical committee of the Faculty of Human \n\nKinetics (University of Lisbon) and data were collected at the Laboratory of \n\nBiomechanics and Functional Morphology in four periods: during the later stages of the \n\nfirst, second and third trimesters of gestation and in the postpartum period. Before the \n\nmotor task was performed, anthropometric data were measured (weight and height), \n\naccording to the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK) \n\nstandardized measurement protocol (Stewart et al., 2011) by ISAK certified \n\nanthropometrists, to calculate the body segment masses and inertia moments.  \n\nIn order to collect static and dynamic data trials, spherical reflective markers \n\nwere placed on the skin on both sides of the lower body with double-sided adhesive \n\ntape. The marker set-up was in agreement with the recommendation of Cappozzo and \n\ncolleagues (Cappozzo et al., 1997) for lower limb segments, and CODA (Charnwood \n\nDynamics Ltd, Leicestershire, United Kingdom) protocols for models of the pelvic \n\nsegment.  \n\nThe motor task was to walk barefoot for a distance of 10 metres between two \n\npoints in a straight line in both directions at a natural and comfortable speed for three \n\nminutes. The floor had no specific patterns or irregularities, and the participants had no \n\nknowledge about the location of force platforms, which were placed in the middle of the \n\ndefined distance. Participants were allowed to become familiar with the laboratory \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 3D kinetic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum \n\n \n\n \n48 \n\nsystem and no fatigue occurrence was reported. The participants performed three non-\n\nconsecutive minutes' walking at a comfortable speed. \n\nPlanar motion of the hip, knee and ankle joints was calculated with Visual 3D \n\n(V3D) software (C-Motion Inc., Germantown, USA) by a computational procedure \n\nimplementing the dot product between the skeletal segments articulated by these joints \n\n(Figure 5). \n\n \n \n\nFigure 5. Reconstructed biomechanical model in Visual 3D with marker setup used for motion captures. Anterior and \nlateral view of the model. \n\nKinematic data were collected by 12 infrared high-speed cameras (Oqus-300, \n\nQualisys, Sweden) at a rate of 200 Hz, and kinetic data were collected with two Kistler \n\nforce platforms (Kistler AG, Winterthur, Switzerland) measuring 0.60 m x 0.40 m and \n\none AMTI platform (Advanced Mechanical Technology, Inc., Watertown, U.S.A.) \n\nmeasuring 0.90 m x 0.60 m, at a rate of 1000 Hz. The capture hardware was \n\nconnected to a Qualisys USB Analog Acquisition interface in order to synchronize \n\nkinetic and kinematic data with software Qualisys Track Manager (QTM; Qualisys AB, \n\nGothenburg, Sweden). Both data sequences were recorded in the same file. The \n\nsystem was calibrated by wand type, with an exact wand length of 751.4 mm moved \n\nrandomly across the recorded field, before the data collection of each participant. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Kinetic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum \n\n \n\n \n49 \n\n \n\nCalibration was accepted if the standard deviation of the wand\u2019s length measures was \n\nbelow 0.5 mm. Cameras were positioned statically to minimize light reflection artefacts \n\nand to allow recording of at least two consecutive walking cycles, defined as the time \n\nbetween two consecutive initial ground contacts of the heel strike with each foot. The \n\nlast four cycles performed by each participant were considered in the analysis.  \n\nA 3D analysis was performed, including both sides of the body. The trajectory of \n\nthe reflective markers was smoothed with a Butterworth low-pass filter with a 10 Hz \n\ncut-off. Collected data were interpolated by means of cubic spline interpolation as \n\nsuggested by Robertson and colleagues (2014), for a maximum 10-frame gap, and \n\nfiltered with a Butterworth digital low pass filter, at 10 Hz cut-off frequency for kinematic \n\nand kinetic data, as suggested by Robertson and Dowling (2003). All data were \n\nnormalized in time. \n\nThe four time phases were considered in analysis, and kinetic pattern curves of \n\nthe three components of the GRF were normalized to units of body weight, and were \n\nestimated relative to the total time of contact of the foot with the ground. These data \n\ncurves and peak values were estimated for left and right sides with V3D software (C-\n\nMotion, Inc., Germantown, USA).  \n\nThe net joint moments and powers of the ankle, knee and hip were calculated \n\nwith an inverse dynamics approach, considering an XYZ Cardan sequence for joint \n\nangles, and resolved for the proximal segment\u2019s coordinate system (Selbie, Hamill, &amp; \n\nKepple, 2014) in Visual3D software. For kinetic parameters, initial foot contact data \n\nwere collected at the time corresponding to first contact of the foot on the floor, and \n\nfinal contact data were collected at the last contact of the foot on the floor. \n\nIn the four periods under analysis, the following variables of the GRF curves \n\nwere analysed: three peaks characterized the vertical component, two peaks \n\ncharacterized the anterior-posterior component, and two peaks characterized the \n\nmedial-lateral component. \n\nThe joints\u2019 moments\u2019 patterns were as follows. The hip was characterized by \n\ntwo peaks in the sagittal plane, two peaks in the frontal plane, and one peak in the \n\ntransverse plane. The knee moment was characterized by three peaks in the sagittal \n\nplane. The ankle moment was characterized by two peaks in the sagittal plane, one \n\npeak in the frontal plane, and two peaks in the transverse plane. \n\nThe joints\u2019 power patterns were as follows. The hip power was characterized by \n\ntwo peaks in the sagittal plane, three peaks in the frontal plane, and two peaks in the \n\ntransverse plane. The knee power was characterized by three peaks in the sagittal \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 3D kinetic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum \n\n \n\n \n50 \n\nplane. The ankle power was characterized by two peaks in the sagittal plane, two \n\npeaks in the frontal plane, and two peaks in the transverse plane.  \n\n Statistical Analysis \n\nAll statistical procedures were conducted with IBM SPSS Statistics 22 software \n\nfor Windows. Shapiro-Wilk normality tests were conducted and not assumed for all \n\ncases. The Mauchly\u2019s test of sphericity was performed before repeated measures RM) \n\nanalysis and sphericity was not assumed in all tests. For post hoc tests, the Bonferroni \n\ntest based on Student's t statistic was used, after adjustment of the observed \n\nsignificance level to account for the fact that multiple comparisons were made. For \n\nvariables and groups which not fulfil all assumptions for RM analysis, the Friedman test \n\nwas performed, and for pairwise analysis the Wilcoxon test was performed. In this \n\ncase, Bonferroni confidence interval adjustment was applied to cater for the confidence \n\nintervals and significance values for multiple comparisons. \n\n Results \n\n Ground Reaction Forces \n\nMost of the components of the GRF are influenced by the stage of pregnancy, \n\nparticularly in the three peaks of the vertical component; in the two peaks of the \n\nanterior-posterior component; and at the first peak of the medial-lateral component of \n\nGRF (Figure 6).  \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Kinetic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum \n\n \n\n \n51 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.

Units (mean\u00b1sd) for GRF are expressed as a percentage of body weight. \n\nThe first and second peaks of vertical GRF shows significant changes from third \n\ntrimester to the postpartum period, emphasizing an increase of 4% in the braking peak \n\nand a decrease of 5% of bodyweight (BW) in the inverted peak for right lower limb. In \n\nboth stances, were observed a significant decrease of 5% BW in the third peak from \n\nthe first to the third trimester, and an increase of about 7% BW from the end of \n\npregnancy to postpartum period, which corresponds to a recovery to values above \n\nthose recorded in early pregnancy. Also in propulsive peak, to the right stance, there is \n\na decrease of 4% BW from second to third trimester. In the anterior-posterior \n\ncomponent of GRF, were found an increase of 2% BW from first trimester to \n\npostpartum period in the posterior direction (first peak) of the right lower limb, and a \n\ndecrease of 2% BW in the anterior direction (second peak) of the left lower limb which \n\nrepresents that at the end of pregnancy the participants apply less of their bodyweight \n\nof force against the floor in the loading response phase and in the pre-swing phase. \n\nThe medial-lateral component of GRF decreases in the first peak, moving from a \n\nmedial reaction to a lateral reaction in the third trimester to the postpartum period. \n\n Joint Moments of Force \n\n Sagittal Plane \n\nA longitudinal effect of pregnancy in joint moments of force in the sagittal plane \n\nwas observed for some peaks of hip and ankle joints (Figure 7).  \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Kinetic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum \n\n \n\n \n53 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7.

The left ankle joint, shows a significant \n\ndecrease of around 0.06 W.kg-1 in the ankle abductors, from the first and second \n\ntrimesters to late pregnancy, which represents a lower eccentric contraction of these \n\nmuscles during terminal stance phase. \n\n Discussion \n\nThis study aimed to analyse the biomechanics of gait during pregnancy and \n\npostpartum period in a longitudinal perspective, in order to understand if there are any \n\nchanges in the kinetic parameters of gait between collection phases. While other \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Kinetic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum \n\n \n\n \n61 \n\n \n\nstudies did not  found any changes in the vertical or anterior components of GRF (Abu \n\nOsman &amp; Mat Ghazali, 2002; Lymbery &amp; Gilleard, 2005; McCrory et al., 2011), in this \n\nstudy the quantification of vertical GRF has shown a decrease in the braking and \n\npropulsive peaks from late pregnancy to postpartum period where it has values similar \n\nto those found in the first two trimesters of pregnancy. This results suggests that \n\ndownward acceleration for the advancement of the body of the pregnant women and \n\nrespective force production in the transmission of weight are smaller in late pregnancy \n\n(Perry, 1992). In the medial-lateral component, it was found that in late pregnancy \n\nwomen have more medial reaction for left lower limb, similarly to the results also found \n\nby Takeda, Junji, Aya, Sigeko, and Yosie (2009) and our previous study [5] particularly \n\nduring the loading response phase, which means that participants maintain the medial \n\nforce during most of the stance phase. Few studies have found significant changes in \n\nthe medial reaction forces, but many authors make reference to a greater instability in \n\nthe frontal plane of the pregnant woman (e.g., Branco et al., In press; Lymbery &amp; \n\nGilleard, 2005; McCrory et al., 2011), for which these results indicate the motor \n\nresponse to this instability, thereby promoting greater body stability. The fact that the \n\nchanges only happen in one of the lower limbs shows that the compensations derived \n\nfrom imbalances can happen only in one of the limbs to maintain balance, and \n\nreinforces the need to make analyses of the two sides. \n\nIn the sagittal plane, the kinetics of the hip joint has a significant reduction in the \n\nparticipation of the hip extensors during the loading response phase, which is highly \n\nassociated with pregnancy. The participation of the hip extensors is related with the \n\nacceptance and support of the weight, which may be adversely affected by the reduced \n\ncontribution of these muscles as the pregnancy progresses. At the terminal stance \n\nphase a reduction in the participation of the right hip flexors were established, also \n\naccompanied by a decrease in eccentric contraction of these muscles. In this phase, \n\nthe extension of the thigh is promoted by inertia and gravity (Whittle, 2007), and these \n\nresults suggest less control in this motor action by pregnant women. In fact, the main \n\nobjective of the hip joint muscles during the stance phase is the stabilization of the \n\ntrunk (Perry, 1992), function that is affected, taking into account the majority of the \n\nresults found. \n\nIn our previous study (Branco et al., In press) there was a significant decrease \n\nin knee joint moments between the group of pregnant women and the group of non-\n\npregnant, showing that changes in the knee joint moments happen until the end of the \n\nfirst trimester. This is not observed in the present study, where the participation of the \n\nknee joint flexor and extensor remain similar throughout pregnancy. However, the \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 3D kinetic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum \n\n \n\n \n62 \n\nvariation of mechanical energy in these muscle groups has been influenced by \n\npregnancy, with a significant reduction in the production of mechanical energy of the \n\nright knee extensors during mid-stance phase. The main function of the kinetics of the \n\nknee during this phase is to stabilize lower limbs when the total body weight is \n\ntransferred for a single limb support, which in this case might be compromised. The \n\nkinetics of the ankle is influenced by pregnancy in participation of the plantarflexors \n\nduring the pre-swing phase, with a decrease throughout pregnancy and a recovery of \n\nthat participation in postpartum period. Two indications can be drawn from these \n\nresults: the first is that the acceleration of the limb forward will be lower in late \n\npregnancy; and the second is that this participation is fully recovered after delivery. \n\nOther studies reported some changes in the joint moments for the frontal plane, \n\nparticularly an increase of the hip joint moments (tested only between third trimester \n\nand postpartum) the knee joint moments (Huang et al., 2002), and a decrease of ankle \n\njoint moments (Branco et al., In press). In this study no changes were found throughout \n\npregnancy or postpartum. However, we found the influence of pregnancy on the \n\nabsorption of mechanical energy in the hip abductors during late loading response \n\nphase, without a specific change between collected phases. One possible reason for \n\nthe absence of any changes in the frontal plane may be revealed by the descriptive \n\nstatistics of these variables, which relates to the fact that they present the highest \n\nvariability (standard deviation) between the analyses of the planes of motion. \n\nOnly our previous study (Branco et al., In press) reports changes during \n\npregnancy in the transverse plane kinetics. In this study, during the loading response \n\nphase, significant increases were found in the participation of the right hip external \n\nrotators, and eccentric contraction of these muscles, particularly in the second half of \n\nthe pregnancy. This action is responsible for deceleration of the pelvis rotation, which \n\naids in the advancement of the contralateral thigh (Perry, 1992), indicating that during \n\npregnancy there is an increased control in advance of the contralateral limb. During the \n\nterminal stance phase, a decrease in eccentric contraction of the left ankle abductors \n\nalong the pregnancy was observed, which indicates less control in the position of the \n\nleft foot during the first moments of heel rise. The hypothesis of this study, that \n\npregnancy is associated with kinetic adaptations, is partially confirmed by many of the \n\nkinetic parameters, for the three planes of motion. Only partially because were found \n\nchanges in many kinetic variables, but only in few of them the changes happen \n\nbilaterally and the recovery of these parameters were not confirmed in all cases, \n\nespecially in the transverse plane. This result indicates that some situations of body \n\ninstability might be maintained in the postpartum, suggesting the importance of \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Kinetic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum \n\n \n\n \n63 \n\n \n\nphysical activity, in order to promote the full recovery of the body stability. In the sagittal \n\nplane, for the vast majority of the parameters with significant changes, a recovery to \n\nvalues similar to those found in early pregnancy was observed, confirming the \n\nhypothesis raised.  \n\nAccording to Forczek and Staszkiewicz (2012), the pregnant woman has two \n\nmain strategies for adjustment of biomechanical parameters: first to increase the body \n\nstability, and; second, to reduce the energy expenditure. Based on our results, the \n\nsecond approach seems to be adopted in respect to the kinetic parameters. However, \n\nmost studies on kinematic parameters of pregnant women during walking, point to \n\nfindings related to the first strategy. This suggests that, on the one hand, the woman \n\nincreases her body stability in detriment of cost energy (based on kinematics), and on \n\nthe other hand, reduces the mechanical load in order to reduce the energy cost (based \n\non kinetics). This reflection shows a balance between strategies, which require further \n\nanalysis. This is in line with some theories of motor behaviour that indicate that when \n\nthe body is faced with constraints of the organism (and possibly other constraints) it \n\nself-organizes in order to have greater efficiency (Goldfield, 1995; Kugler &amp; Turvey, \n\n1988).  \n\nWith regard to changes during pregnancy, the morphological and body \n\ncomposition parameters are those that are widely known. However, it is not known how \n\nthese variables influence the biomechanical parameters, or which of them give further \n\nexplanation to mechanical changes in the musculoskeletal system of the pregnant \n\nwoman. Thus, we suggest that future studies quantify the morphological and body \n\ncomposition changes, and analyse how these changes influence the biomechanical \n\nparameters of women throughout pregnancy and in the postpartum period. \n\n Conclusions \n\nA descriptive longitudinal type design was performed, in which pregnant women \n\nwere assessed in the first, second and third trimesters of pregnancy and in the sixth \n\nmonth of the postpartum period. The biomechanical analysis of the lower limb during \n\ngait showed that pregnancy is a factor that influences the kinetic variables of the ankle, \n\nknee and hip joints. The joint that undergoes the most evident changes is by far the \n\nhip. This fact may be justified by being closer to the body region with greater \n\nanatomical and morphological changes. The overall results point to biomechanical \n\nadjustments that show a decrease of the mechanical load of women throughout \n\npregnancy, possibly in order to avoid strong interaction between women and the \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 3D kinetic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum \n\n \n\n \n64 \n\nground, confirmed by the decrease of GRF, the joint moments and joint powers in the \n\nsagittal plane, whose parameters are primarily responsible for the progression of the \n\nbody in space. These results point to some applications to this population, namely the \n\nneed to perform physical activities for the development of body stability, particularly the \n\nstability of the joints of the lower limbs \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Kinetic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum \n\n \n\n \n65 \n\n \n\n References \n\nA.C.O.G.

British Journal of Sport Medicine. \n\n(Appendix 2) \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Influence of body composition changes on kinetics \n\n \n\n \n68 \n\n Abstract \n\nPregnancy is a special phase of women's lives, which process leads to several \n\nchanges in body composition and morphology. With these changes, it is not clear \n\nwhether the biomechanical changes occurring in this period are due exclusively to body \n\ncomposition and body size, or due to other physiological factors. The purpose of this \n\nstudy was to quantify the anthropometry and body composition of women throughout \n\npregnancy and in the postpartum period, and identify the contribution of these \n\nparameters on the lower limb joints kinetic during gait. Eleven healthy Caucasian \n\nwomen (33.2\u00b11.6years old) were assessed longitudinally, during pregnancy and in \n\npostpartum, regarding several anthropometric measurements to determine body \n\ncomposition and kinetic parameters of gait. Most of the variables associated with body \n\ncomposition and body dimensions showed a significant increase during pregnancy and \n\na decrease in the postpartum. Maternal\u2019s body composition in the postpartum was \n\nsimilar to those found in the 1st trimester, except for triceps skinfold, calf total area, and \n\nbody mass index, with higher results than at the beginning of pregnancy. The \n\napplication of the linear regression technique for predicting women's internal loading \n\nduring pregnancy and in the postpartum period through anthropometric variables, \n\ndeveloped four models that include variables associated with the amount of fat, four \n\nmodels that include variables related to overall body weight, three models that include \n\nfat-free mass, and one model that includes the shape of the trunk as a predictor \n\nvariable. The study showed significant changes during pregnancy, regarding the \n\nvariables associated with global body composition. The absolute amount of fat \n\nincreases significantly to the end of pregnancy, especially by the contribution of the \n\nadipose tissue accumulated in skinfolds of upper limbs and the upper trunk. All models \n\nhad an adjusted R squared between 29.6 and 66.9, indicating that changes in \n\nmaternal\u2019s body composition and morphology, largely determine kinetic dynamics of \n\nthe female joints in this particular stage of life  \n\nKeywords: Pregnancy, postpartum, body composition, kinetic dynamics, gait. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Influence of body composition changes on kinetics \n\n \n\n69 \n \n\n Introduction \n\nDuring pregnancy and in the postpartum period, the woman\u2019s body experiences \n\nlarge changes in morphology, physiology and consequently, in body composition. The \n\nassociation between body composition, particularly the increase of maternal weight and \n\nhealth related problems are known for mother and child well-being (Leddy, Power, &amp; \n\nSchulkin, 2008; Tenenbaum-Gavish &amp; Hod, 2013). According to Institute of Medicine \n\nand National Research Council of the National Academies (2009), women with a body \n\nmass index (BMI) lower than 19.8kg/m2 (underweight) should increase their weight \n\nbetween 12.5kg and 18kg; women with BMI between 19.8kg/m2 and 26.0kg/m2 (normal \n\nweight) must have an increase in body weight between 11.5kg and 16kg; women with \n\nBMI between 26kg/m2 and 29.0kg/m2 (overweight) must have an increase in weight of \n\n7kg to 11.5kg; women with BMI equal or greater than 29kg/m2 (obese) should gain at \n\nleast 6.8kg. For women carrying twins, the recommended target total weight gain at \n\nterm is 16.0 to 20.5kg (Institute of Medicine and National Research Council of the \n\nNational Academies, 2009; Silva &amp; Bellotto, 2015). \n\nWeight gain during pregnancy has been widely studied and is reported in \n\nseveral studies as described below. In general, during pregnancy the weight gain \n\nstands at around 11kg (Kopp-Hoolihan, Van Loan, Wong, &amp; King, 1999; Larciprete et \n\nal., 2003; Soltani &amp; Fraser, 2000) although it has been increasing in recent years from \n\n9kg (Thame, Trotman, Osmond, Fletcher, &amp; Antoine, 2007) to 14.5kg (Straughen, \n\nTrudeau, &amp; Misra, 2013) in non-obese women, with much of these gains occurring \n\nduring the 2nd trimester. However, in late pregnancy, women accumulate an average of \n\n4kg of body fat (Kopp-Hoolihan et al., 1999; Larciprete et al., 2003; Thame et al., \n\n2007). The prevalence of women with normal weight significantly decreased between \n\nthe 2nd and the 3rd trimesters from 63.2% to 39.5%, respectively (Perez, Murillo, \n\nHernandez, &amp; Herrera, 2010). After delivery, the woman's weight remains above her \n\npre-pregnancy body weight (Kopp-Hoolihan et al., 1999) or in early pregnancy (Soltani \n\n&amp; Fraser, 2000). \n\nWomen classified as obese in early pregnancy have significantly higher sum of \n\nskinfolds thickness and higher fat mass gains compared to normal weight women \n\n(Soltani &amp; Fraser, 2000). Although different studies showed an increase of the skinfolds \n\nthickness throughout pregnancy, changes were not always significant. Thus, the \n\nskinfolds that showed significant increases were: subscapular, suprailiac and thigh \n\n(Piperata, Dufour, Reina, &amp; Spurr, 2002); triceps, biceps and subscapular (Lopez, \n\nCalvo, Poy, Balmaceda, &amp; Camera, 2011); and mid-thigh and calf skinfolds (Perez et \n\nal., 2010). \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Influence of body composition changes on kinetics \n\n \n\n \n70 \n\nBody dimensions of pregnant women measured by the segmental girths show \n\nthat thigh (Perez et al., 2010; Piperata et al., 2002), hip and calf girths (Piperata et al., \n\n2002) significantly increase during pregnancy. Also between the 2nd and the 3rd \n\ntrimesters there are an increase of body fat areas of the mid-thigh and calf and of the \n\ntotal fat mass (Perez et al., 2010). \n\nThe influence of body segment parameters in the estimation of inverse \n\ndynamics solutions have been investigated by some studies conducted in the last \n\ndecade (Ganley &amp; Powers, 2004; Rao, Amarantini, Berton, &amp; Favier, 2006; Silva &amp; \n\nAmbr\u00f3sio, 2004). However, it is not known the influence of body composition and \n\nmorphologic changes on woman\u2019s biomechanical parameters of gait during pregnancy \n\nand in postpartum period.  \n\n Objectives  \n\nThe purpose of this study was to quantify maternal anthropometric and body \n\ncomposition changes throughout pregnancy and in the postpartum period, and to \n\nidentify the contribution of these parameters on the lower limb joints kinetic during gait.  \n\n Materials and Methods \n\n Subjects \n\nThe sample was composed of 11 healthy Caucasian women (33.2\u00b11.6years, \n\nrange 32-37) without musculoskeletal problems, neuromuscular disorders or other \n\ndiseases.

None of the participants had contraindication for the practice of physical \n\nexercise. All subjects gave written informed consent prior to participation in the study.  \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Influence of body composition changes on kinetics \n\n \n\n71 \n \n\n Data Collection and Processing  \n\nData were collected at the Laboratory of Biomechanics and Functional \n\nMorphology of the Faculty of Human Kinetics in four periods: at gestational age of \n\n14.2\u00b12.4weeks, at 27.3\u00b11.0weeks, and at 36.3\u00b10.9weeks and in the postpartum period \n\nat 20.6\u00b15.2 weeks. \n\nThe anthropometric variables collected were body weight, height, six skinfolds \n\n(subscapular, triceps, biceps, iliac crest, front thigh and medial calf); four girths \n\n(abdominal, gluteal, mid-thigh and calf) and; three breaths (biiliocristale, thoracic and \n\nbiacromial). All anthropometric data were measured according to the International \n\nSociety for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK) standardized measurement \n\nprotocol (Stewart et al., 2011), with exception for abdominal girth, which was measured \n\n2cm below belly button (navel), and the thoracic breadth, which was measured at the \n\nlevel of the last rib. Data were collected by ISAK certified anthropometrists. Based on \n\nthese measurements, other variables were calculated, including body weight gain in \n\neach trimester by reference to pre-pregnancy body weight (self-reported by pregnant in \n\na specific questionnaire form); the body density and the percentage of fat mass (Durnin \n\n&amp; Womersley, 1974), muscle and fat areas of the thigh and lower leg (Frisancho, \n\n2011); the body fat and fat-free mass; the biiliocristale-acromiale and abdominal-gluteal \n\nratio and BMI. \n\nKinematic and kinetic parameters were collected through 12 infrared high-speed \n\ncameras (Oqus-300, Qualisys, Sweden) at a rate of 200Hz, and 3 force platforms (2 \n\nKistlers - Kistler AG, Winterthur, Switzerland; and 1 AMTI force plate - Advanced \n\nMechanical Technology, Inc., Watertown), at a rate of 1000Hz. Spherical reflective \n\nmarkers were placed on the skin in lower limb segments with double-sided adhesive \n\ntape at predefined locations according to recent recommendations (Hamill et al., 2014). \n\nKinetic and kinematic data were synchronized to the same file through software \n\nQualisys Track Manager (QTM; Qualisys AB, Gothenburg, Sweden). Data were \n\ncollected during 3 non-consecutive minutes walking at a comfortable speed and were \n\nconsidered the last 4 cycles performed by each participant. The procedures were fully \n\ndescribed in a previous paper (Branco et al., 2013; Branco et al., In press). \n\n Statistical Analysis \n\nThe statistical procedures were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics 22 \n\nsoftware for Windows. Shapiro-Wilk normality tests were conducted and not assumed \n\nfor all cases. Repeated Measures ANOVA analysis was used to verify the differences \n\nbetween groups. For variables and groups which not commit all assumptions for \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Influence of body composition changes on kinetics \n\n \n\n \n72 \n\nrepeated measures analysis, was performed the Friedman test. To development the \n\nprediction models was used the linear regression with the enter method. Only one \n\npredictor variable can enter this technique because of the sample size (Stevens, 2009). \n\n Results \n\n Anthropometric and body composition profile \n\nThe anthropometric and body composition profile of the women during \n\npregnancy and in postpartum is described in Table 12 and Table 13.  \n\nAll anthropometric variables were significantly influenced by pregnancy, with \n\nexception for mid-thigh girth and biiliocristal-biacromial ratio. \n\nAlthough the bioacromial breath was significantly different between the 1st and \n\nthe 3rd trimester and from the 1st trimester and postpartum, the biiliocristal breath was \n\nonly significantly different from the 1st trimester and the 3rd trimester (an increase of \n\n1.5cm, P?0.001); thus, no significant differences (P>0.05) were observed for \n\nbiiliocristal-biacromial ratio (Table 12). \n\nThe thoracic breadth shows changes between all pairs of collection phases, \n\nwith exception for the 1st trimester and postpartum, increasing 2.6cm from the 1st to the \n\n3rd trimester, and decreasing the same value from late pregnancy to postpartum. \n\nThe abdominal girth shows a mean increase throughout pregnancy of 16.5cm \n\nand a significant decrease of 14.7cm from 3rd trimester to postpartum. The gluteal girth \n\nalso shows significant increases of 3.1cm and 4.3cm from 1st to 2nd and 3rd trimesters, \n\nand a significant decrease of 3.2cm from late pregnancy to postpartum. The calf girth \n\nonly shows a significant increase of 1.1cm from early to late pregnancy. Only mid-thigh \n\ngirth has no changes in any of the phases observed. \n\nThe subscapular and biceps skinfolds shows a significant increase of \n\nrespectively 1.9mm and 0.3mm from 1st to 3rd trimester, without changes from 3rd \n\ntrimester to postpartum. The triceps skinfold increases its size from 1st, 2nd and 3rd \n\ntrimester to postpartum, respectively 3.8mm, 2.5mm and 3.7mm. The Iliac crest, front \n\nthigh and calf skinfolds have no changes throughout pregnancy and postpartum. The \n\nsum of the skinfolds shows a significant increase of 6.0mm from 1st to 3rd trimester, \n\nwithout other changes throughout pregnancy and for postpartum period, and the \n\nrelative value of fat mass shows no changes during pregnancy and in the postpartum \n\nperiod. \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Influence of body composition changes on kinetics \n\n \n\n73 \n \n\nTable 12.

In accordance with the \n\nrecommendations of the Subcommittee on Nutritional Status and Weight Gain During \n\nPregnancy of the Committee on Nutritional Status During Pregnancy and Lactation, \n\nInstitute of Medicine, our participants demonstrated a normal BMI (BMI ?19.8 to \n\n26.0kg/m2) during the first two trimesters and in the postpartum period, and overweight \n\nin the last trimester (BMI>26.0 to 29.0kg/m2). On the other hand, during pregnancy \n\naverage weight gain was within the mean values, increasing the recommended values \n\nbetween each trimester, specifically 2kg by the end of the 1st trimester, plus 5kg \n\nbetween 1st and 2nd trimester, and plus 5kg between the 2nd and 3rd trimester (Institute \n\nof Medicine and National Research Council of the National Academies, 2009).  \n\nOnly the segmental areas of the calf were affected by pregnancy. The muscular \n\narea of the calf had a significant increase of 4.2cm2 from the 1st to the 3rd trimester and \n\na significant decrease of 3.9cm2 from the 3rd trimester to the postpartum period. The fat \n\narea of the calf also increased significantly from the 1st to the 3rd trimester and for the \n\npostpartum, respectively of 2.4cm2 and 2.6cm2. The paired comparisons of the total \n\narea of the thigh increased significantly 14.5cm2 and 16.4cm2, respectively from the 1st \n\nto the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. The muscular and fat areas of the thigh did not show any \n\nchanges throughout pregnancy and postpartum. \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Influence of body composition changes on kinetics \n\n \n\n \n74 \n\nTable 13.

After delivery this variable showed a significant decrease, when compared \n\nto the values of the 2nd and 3rd trimesters, in 3kg and 6.6kg respectively.  \n\nThe abdominal-gluteal ratio shows changes throughout pregnancy and in \n\npostpartum period. No changes were found between the 1st trimester and the \n\npostpartum. No significant changes were observed in the biiliocristal-biacromial ratio \n\nduring this study. In every collection phases, acromial-iliac index showed greater \n\nvalues than 0.76, which means that during pregnancy and for postpartum period, \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Influence of body composition changes on kinetics \n\n \n\n75 \n \n\nwomen keeps a trunk with a rectangular shape (Guedes &amp; Guedes, 2006).

In spite \n\nof the small size of the sample, this was a longitudinal study that is in consensus with \n\nothers longitudinal studies conducted during pregnancy (Berggren, Presley, Amini, \n\nHauguel-de Mouzon, &amp; Catalano, 2015; Widen et al., 2015). In general, body \n\ncomposition variables showed an increase throughout pregnancy and a reduction from \n\nlate pregnancy to the postpartum period. Nevertheless, most of these variables did not \n\ndiffer between the 1st trimester and postpartum, with exception for body weight loss, \n\nwhich is significantly lower after delivery than in the 1st trimester (p=0.012).  \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Influence of body composition changes on kinetics \n\n \n\n \n80 \n\nDuring pregnancy several physiological modifications occur in the pregnant \n\nwoman\u2019s body in order to guarantee mother\u2019s energy needs and health and to support \n\nfoetus growth and development (Andres et al., 2015; Berggren et al., 2015; Silva &amp; \n\nBellotto, In press). In fact, maternal body composition has been one of the most studied \n\nparameters, but there is a lack of studies that relate it to the kinetic parameters of gait \n\nduring pregnancy. \n\nIn our study, both weight gain and the body mass index were affected by \n\npregnancy with significant increases during pregnancy (Widen et al., 2015) and \n\nsignificant decreases to postpartum period, as in recent studies (Gunderson et al., \n\n2015). The variation of the mean weight gain, and weight gain between trimesters \n\nremained within the ranges indicated for the BMI of the participants before pregnancy \n\n(Institute of Medicine and National Research Council of the National Academies, 2009; \n\nSilva &amp; Bellotto, In press; Widen et al., 2015). It has been highlighted that maternal fat \n\ngains are associated with important implications for maternal and offspring health and \n\nwith a greater postpartum fat retention in the mother (Widen et al., 2015). In addition, \n\nthe maternal body weight gain may also interfere with important kinetics parameters of \n\ngait, as observed in our results of gait\u2019s kinetics parameters. \n\nIn another recent study (Berggren et al., 2015) to determine women\u2019s metabolic \n\nprofile, 21 healthy women were evaluated: 11 at preconception, during pregnancy and \n\none year postpartum, and 10 had no interval pregnancy, so were assessed at baseline \n\nand a one year after. Weight, fat-free mass (kg), fat mass (kg) and the percentage of \n\nbody fat were assessed by hydrodensitometry. Significant differences (p<0.05) were \n\nobserved for weight and fat-free mass from preconception [59.7 (53.5\u201385.6)kg and \n\n42.5 (39.0\u201349.2)kg, respectively] to pregnancy [77.2 (62.9\u201394.3)kg and 54.7 (46.7\u2013\n\n57.5)kg, respectively]. In contrast, no significant differences were observed in \n\npreconception versus postpartum for these two variables, as well as no significant \n\ndifferences (p>0.05) were observed in body fat according to body size and in the \n\npercentage of body fat between preconception [20.7 (13.7\u201337.4)kg and 30.0 (24.1\u2013\n\n43.8)%] and pregnancy [24.2 (14.9\u201338.7)kg and 30.6 (24.8\u201340.2)%] and between \n\npregnancy and postpartum [18.4 (13.8\u201341.3)kg and 29.3(25.2\u201346.2)%]. Similar results \n\nwith ours in the postpartum period were observed for fat-free mass [44.3 (38.8\u2013\n\n49.6)kg], body fat according to body size [18.4 (13.8\u201341.3)kg] and the percentage of \n\nbody fat [29.3 (25.2\u201346.2)%]. \n\nThe biiliocristal breadth has a significant increase of 1.5cm between the 1st and \n\nthe 3rd trimester and, although there is a reduction in late pregnancy to the postpartum \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Influence of body composition changes on kinetics \n\n \n\n81 \n \n\nperiod, this is not significant, which may suggest that the distance between the iliac \n\nbones remains after pregnancy. \n\nAs expected, abdominal and the gluteal girths suffered major changes \n\nthroughout pregnancy; however these variables recovered in the postpartum to values \n\nsimilar to those found in early pregnancy. The calf girth increased 1.1cm from the 1st to \n\nthe 3rd trimester as Perez et al. (2010) found. These authors also found changes in the \n\nmid-thigh girth, which was not demonstrated in this study. \n\nAlthough the sum of skinfolds showed a significant increase between the 1st and \n\n3rd trimester of pregnancy, mainly caused by subscapular, triceps and biceps skinfolds, \n\nonly the triceps skinfold presented a significant increase of almost 4mm throughout \n\npregnancy to the postpartum period. In spite of no significant changes were observed \n\nin the fat mass percentage, the accumulation of fat mass seems to happen mostly at \n\nthe upper region of the trunk and upper limbs, keeping or increasing their thickness in \n\nthe postpartum period. In addition, relatively to fat mass weight, significantly increases \n\nfrom the 1st to the 2nd trimester and from the 2nd to the 3rd trimester of pregnancy were \n\nshowed. After delivery, the fat mass weight decreases, showing a recovery to levels \n\nsimilar to the first stage of pregnancy. In the same way, the free-fat mass weight \n\nincreases during pregnancy, which may be related to the increase of the tissues and \n\nfluids associated with pregnancy itself and also for the weight of the foetus, and \n\ndecrease again in the postpartum period. \n\nThe bi-compartmental assessment of body composition of the lower limbs can \n\nbe observed by the total, muscle and fat areas of the thigh and calf. Perez et al. (2010) \n\nhave found increases in the thigh fat area and further in calf fat area, between the 2nd \n\nand the 3rd trimester. In this study, only the total area of the thigh showed significant \n\nchanges, increasing 14.5cm2 and 16.4cm2 respectively from the 1st to the 2nd and from \n\nthe 2nd to the 3rd trimesters of pregnancy. In the calf segment, significant increases \n\nwere found throughout pregnancy, both for fat and muscle areas, but only the last \n\nvariable decreases in postpartum period. \n\nThe abdominal-gluteal ratio, shows the volume distribution between the lower \n\ntorso and the pelvic region. Throughout pregnancy it changes so that in late pregnancy \n\nthe distribution of the volume of the abdomen (mainly anterior) and the volume of the \n\nhips (mainly posterior) is the same. The biiliocristal-biacromial ratio do not shows \n\nsignificant changes, meaning that during pregnancy the woman keep a rectangular \n\ntrunk shape (Guedes &amp; Guedes, 2006). \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Influence of body composition changes on kinetics \n\n \n\n \n82 \n\nIn the 3rd trimester, the regression models to predict relative GRF of women \n\nshows that higher ratio between iliocristal and acromial breadth have an increased \n\nmagnitude in the 3rd peak of vertical GRF. \n\nAfter application of the linear regression technique for predicting women's \n\ninternal loading during pregnancy and in the postpartum period through anthropometric \n\nvariables, twelve models were developed, of which four models include independent \n\nvariables associated with the amount of fat; four models include independent variables \n\nrelated to overall body weight; three models include fat-free mass as a predictor \n\nvariable and; a model includes the shape of the trunk as a predictor variable. A \n\nsummary of the interaction between the anthropometric variables and the joint kinetic \n\nvariables of the lower limb, in the four studied stages, are represented in Figure 13 and \n\nFigure 14. \n\nIn the 1st trimester of pregnancy, a higher body weight gain lead to an increased \n\nproduction of mechanical energy of the knee extensors during the mid-stance phase. In \n\nthe 2nd trimester the regression models allow to predict that a greater abdominal-gluteal \n\nratio and a higher percentage of body fat have respectively an increased participation \n\nof the extensors and external rotators of the hip, during the loading response phase. \n\nAlso in this stage of pregnancy, a larger thigh fat area lead to less absorption of \n\nmechanical energy of the hip flexors during terminal stance phase. In the 3rd trimester, \n\na higher body mass index and larger areas of fat of the calf and the thigh increased the \n\nparticipation of the hip external rotators during the loading response phase. In addition, \n\na higher body weight gain, until this trimester, induce to a greater eccentric contraction \n\nof the hip external rotators also in this phase of walking cycle. A higher free-fat mass \n\nweight lead to a lower eccentric contraction of the hip flexors during the terminal \n\nstance, and a lower participation of the hip flexors during pre-swing phase. A higher \n\nweight of free-fat mass and a greater loss of body mass, in the postpartum period, \n\nleads respectively to a lower absorption of mechanical energy of the hip flexors during \n\nterminal stance phase, and to a lower participation of the same muscles during the pre-\n\nswing phase. \n\nConsidering the limitations on the use of simple linear regression techniques, it \n\nshould be appreciated that the variability in the explanation of the models have \n\nrelatively high levels in five of them, whose values are very close to or above 50%. The \n\nhighest levels of explanation in the models variability occurred in the 1st trimester and in \n\nthe postpartum period, during the phases of gait cycle, in which there is an increased \n\nsupport of the body in one lower limb. The reason to happen in the early period of \n\npregnancy and in the postpartum may show that the neuromuscular system of the \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Influence of body composition changes on kinetics \n\n \n\n83 \n \n\nwoman is not prepared for morphological changes happening on her body. This \n\ninformation is relevant not only for the pregnant women, but also for Health and \n\nPhysical Exercise Professionals  \n\n Conclusions \n\nThe study about the influence of the anthropometry and body composition in \n\ninternal loading of women during pregnancy and postpartum, had not been studied yet. \n\nThis study showed significant changes during pregnancy, regarding the variables \n\nassociated with global body composition. The absolute amount of fat increased \n\nsignificantly to the end of pregnancy, especially by the contribution of the adipose \n\ntissue accumulated in the upper limbs and upper trunk. Regarding to the relative values \n\nof fat, there were no changes during pregnancy and to the postpartum period. \n\nThe shape of the trunk in a frontal perspective, the free-fat mass and the weight \n\ngain/loss appeared as major predictors of the joint kinetics of women throughout \n\npregnancy and in the postpartum. Most of the variables related to the amount of fat are \n\npredictors of the muscles involved in motor actions of the transverse plane. Most of the \n\ndeveloped models were used to predict muscle participation involving the hip joint in \n\nthe sagittal and transverse planes of motion, emphasizing that this joint is the one that \n\nis under greater influence of anthropometric variables. \n\nThe body weight gain/loss was the variable that most explained the mechanical \n\nenergy of the lower limb joints, showing that had the most important role in the muscle \n\ncontractions\u2019 dynamics, especially in the 1st and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy. \n\nThe morphological changes that occur during pregnancy had greater influence \n\nin internal load involving the hip. \n\nAlthough, due to the sample size, regression models had only one predictor \n\nvariable; the explanation indices of the models (adjusted r squared) were quite high, \n\nindicating that body composition and pregnant morphology changes during pregnancy, \n\nlargely determining the kinetic dynamics of the female joints in this particular stage of \n\nlife.  \n\nMonitoring maternal\u2019s body composition during pregnancy and kinetic \n\nparameters of gait is difficulty, but of great importance, especially in the 3rd trimester. \n\nIt is recommended for further studies the increase of the sample to allow \n\nregression models with more variables, not only including the anthropometric and body \n\ncomposition parameters, but also physical activity before and during pregnancy.   \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Influence of body composition changes on kinetics \n\n \n\n \n84 \n\n References \n\nAndres, Aline, Hull, Holly R., Shankar, Kartik, Casey, Patrick H., Cleves, Mario A., &amp; \nBadger, Thomas M.

These models involve the development of a \n\nmathematical representation of the biomechanical system (Knudson, 2007), and have \n\nthe objective to increase knowledge and insight about reality (Nigg &amp; Herzog, 2007). In \n\nthe studies included in the present thesis, the biomechanical evaluation aimed at the \n\nanalysis of the musculoskeletal system and see if there were changes in the internal \n\nload of the structures of the lower limbs, during a walking task of women throughout \n\npregnancy and in the postpartum period. \n\nWalking is a fundamental motor skill, whose maturity happens during childhood \n\n(Gabbard, 2004). Throughout life, the variations and the different situations where this \n\nskill is used allow to sustain that the biomechanical changes found during pregnancy \n\nare due to this condition and not for the possible inadequacies of the evaluated motor \n\ntask. Problems related to locomotion constitute a major area of focus for many \n\nbiomechanists (Robertson et al., 2014), especially in special populations, such as \n\npregnancy, where the quantification of biomechanical parameters constitute a source \n\nof information for different purposes, whether for clinical or exercise professionals. \n\nThe anthropometric assessment of women is usually performed, especially \n\nwhen there is a possibility of becoming pregnant. During the reproductive period of the \n\nwoman, the anthropometric assessment allows to evaluate the ability to deal with the \n\nphysiological stress of pregnancy, and during pregnancy it allows to identify the \n\nnutritional status of women and, indirectly, the growth of the fetus (WHO, 1995). Of the \n\nmain changes experienced by pregnant, the morphological adaptations are those that \n\nare more visible, and since these are changes that take place in an individualized \n\nmanner for each woman, it is considered as organismic constraints (Bartlett, 2007; \n\nNewell, 1986). The organismic constraints are mainly biomechanical because they are \n\nrelated to a given individual\u2019s body characteristics, which affects movement responses \n\nto the task and environmental constraints (Bartlett, 2007). The visible changes that \n\nhappen in a woman's body during pregnancy and returning to happen in the \n\npostpartum period, have been the reason to investigate the body mechanics of women, \n\nespecially the load dynamics, and respective movement responses that these changes \n\ntrigger (e.g., Branco et al., In press; Foti et al., 2000). In order to increase the \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \u2013 General discussion and conclusions \n\n \n\n \n89 \n\nknowledge in these fields of study, which arises from changes caused since the \n\nbeginning of pregnancy to the postpartum period, several objectives have been \n\nestablished (chapter 1).  \n\nTo have a better overview of the available evidence on the biomechanical \n\nadaptations of gait that occur throughout pregnancy and in postpartum, a systematic \n\nreview was performed (chapter 2). The research conducted showed that there is a \n\nscarcity of studies covering a longitudinal experimental design, and the biomechanical \n\nchanges arising from pregnancy are few, considering all the variables under study. \n\nMost studies are focused in the comparisons between the 2nd and 3rd trimester, or \n\nbetween 3rd trimester and postpartum. \n\nRegarding the kinematical analysis of gait during pregnancy and postpartum a \n\ndescriptive and inferential analysis of the temporal and spatial parameters of gait, and \n\nof the angular kinematics were performed (chapter 3). According to previous  studies, \n\nmost results of temporal and spatial parameters point that the pregnant woman has a \n\ngreater need to promote their body stabilization, while performing shorter and wider \n\nsteps, and have a longer time in double support phase (Branco et al., 2013; Carpes et \n\nal., 2008; Forczek &amp; Staszkiewicz, 2012; W. Gilleard, 2013; Hagan &amp; Wong, 2010; \n\nLymbery &amp; Gilleard, 2005). Even the results of our temporal and spatial data do not \n\ncorroborate that, because we did not obtain any significant changes, this is a subject \n\nwhich has been repeatedly approached by other authors (W. Gilleard, 2013; Lymbery &amp; \n\nGilleard, 2005), and probably requires an individualized analysis in the future. Based \n\non these results we answer to part of the first experimental question and fulfill the first \n\nobjective outlined. \n\nBased on the kinematic results found in chapter 3, the pelvis is one of the \n\nsegments which features change since the early stages of pregnancy. This was not \n\nfound in any of the previous studies, for two main reasons: the first reason is because \n\nmost studies did not analyze the pregnancy period since its beginning, and the second \n\nreason is because the studies that included the beginning of pregnancy, did not \n\nconsider this variable. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that the anterior tilt and \n\nthe right lateral elevation of the pelvis, take place during the second and third \n\ntrimesters of pregnancy. Moreover, it seems that these changes are derived from the \n\nincrease in abdominal volume and an increase of the fetal weight, which achieves 40% \n\nof his final weight until the end of the second trimester, and the remaining during the \n\nthird trimester (Whitcome et al., 2007). Although in the literature is found a reduction in \n\nanterior tilt of the pelvis between the third trimester and the postpartum (Foti et al., \n\n2000), or between the group of non-pregnant women (Branco et al., 2013), this was not \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \u2013 General discussion and conclusions\n\n \n\n \n90 \n\nseen in our results, which allows us to state that is after the sixth month postpartum \n\nthat the woman diminishes the anterior tilt. In addition to these variables, in late \n\npregnancy the women show a decrease of the right lateral fall of the pelvis, when \n\ncompared with the postpartum period. The changes of lateral elevation and fall of the \n\npelvis between trimesters may show an attempt to control the angular momentum of \n\nthe trunk caused by the increase of its moment of inertia (W. Gilleard, 2013). These \n\nresults show that the pelvis experiences a change in their mobility, without thereby \n\ninfluence the range of motion of this segment. \n\nThe hip is the joint that suffers more changes, in the angular displacement \n\n(chapter 3), and also in regard to load dynamics (chapter 4) (Branco et al., 2013; \n\nBranco et al., In press; Foti et al., 2000). Considering the gait cycle, during the weight \n\nacceptance, the main changes are related to the dynamics of hip internal loading. \n\nSpecifically, during the loading response phase between the first and second trimester \n\nwomen increases the absorption of mechanical energy of the hip external rotators, and \n\nin the third trimester decreases the hip extension moment, increasing again in the \n\npostpartum period to higher values than those found in early pregnancy. These \n\nchanges may put into question the stability of the hip, as the weight of transition from \n\none support to another needs to have well-established all possible points of instability, \n\nlike segments and joints (Los Amigos Research Education Institute Inc et al., 2001), \n\nespecially those in kinetic path (pelvic girdle and lower limbs). Evidence for an attempt \n\nto improve the stabilization of the hip, is visible during the acceptance of the woman's \n\nweight in the second trimester by increasing absorption of mechanical energy of the \n\nexternal rotators. However, by the end of pregnancy this does not happen, not only \n\nbecause previous result does not occur, but also because there is a decrease in \n\nmoment extension, which could indicate an increased instability of the hip. This \n\ninstability during the transition of the weight from one foot to the other, will make that in \n\nthe beginning of the single support (mid-stance phase) there is an increase of the hip \n\nextension moment, from the first to the second and third trimesters, allowing us to state \n\nthat this phase and joint are the ones with a mechanical overload during pregnancy. \n\nThe significant changes found in the hip during terminal stance phase are mainly \n\nkinematics, where among all collection stages, continuously occurs an increased \n\ninternal rotation of the hip. These results may point to an attempt to stabilize the knee \n\ndue to a weakness of the quadriceps, which can be evidenced by a decrease in the \n\nabsorption of mechanical energy of the hip flexors in late pregnancy, or may be a result \n\nof hypertonicity of the muscles responsible for this motor action, affecting the \n\nprogression of body and limb clearance (Los Amigos Research Education Institute Inc \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \u2013 General discussion and conclusions \n\n \n\n \n91 \n\net al., 2001). Also in single limb support, but in the pre-swing phase, there is a \n\nprogressive decrease of the hip extension throughout the pregnancy. This effect is \n\nsurpassed in the postpartum period, where the hip extension returns to values similar \n\nto those found in the first trimester. Another consequence, of pregnancy in this gait \n\nphase, is the significant reduction of hip flexors moment, without thereby affecting the \n\nflexion of the hip in the stages of the swing limb advancement. In fact, there were no \n\nchanges in the kinematics during initial swing phase, and during the mid-swing phase \n\nthe woman performs a greater hip flexion as the pregnancy advances.  \n\nThroughout the gait cycle, the only change in the knee during the stance is an \n\nincreased production of mechanical energy of the knee extensors, seen in the first \n\ntrimester compared to postpartum. In swing phase, there are two kinematic changes. \n\nThe first change happens in the initial swing phase, where the magnitude of the \n\nmaximum flexion peak is higher in the second trimester than at the beginning of \n\npregnancy, explaining the greater flexion of the hip in mid-swing phase; and the second \n\nchange, on which the magnitude of the knee flexion is lower in the second trimester, \n\nprobably in an attempt to decrease the time in single support of contralateral limb. This \n\nwas not verified in our results, but it was reported in the studies of Carpes et al. (2008) \n\nand Foti et al. (2000).  \n\nMost of the changes in the ankle joint occur during the single limb support, \n\nespecially at kinetic level, pointing to a lower mechanical load around this joint. This \n\nlower mechanical load is reflected by a decrease in the plantarflexors moment at the \n\nend of pregnancy, indicating a greater care in the advancement of pregnant body, and \n\nin the postpartum an increase of this variable to values similar at early pregnancy \n\nhighlight the influence that pregnancy has on joint kinetics. The greater care in body \n\nadvancement seems to be associated with a lower ability to stabilize the ankle joint, \n\nrevealed by a significant a decrease of mechanical energy absorption of the ankle \n\nabductors from early pregnancy to the second and third trimester. The kinematic \n\nchanges take place in the pre-swing and initial swing, with a decrease in ankle \n\ninversion in late pregnancy, which further increases in the postpartum period. This \n\ninversion of the ankle is usually associated with lower ankle stabilization, confirmed in \n\nanother level by kinetic results. However, according to Los Amigos Research \n\nEducation Institute Inc et al. (2001), the likely cause to increase this motor action is a \n\nlack of selective control of pretibials and a plantarflexion contracture, especially during \n\nsingle limb support, a fact that our kinetic results also shows. \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \u2013 General discussion and conclusions\n\n \n\n \n92 \n\nBased on these results we can state that there are changes taking place \n\nspecifically during pregnancy, thus responding to the first two experimental questions \n\nand fulfilling the second, third, fourth and fifth objectives outlined. \n\nThe quantification of anthropometric, morphological and body composition \n\nchanges of women throughout pregnancy, and the recovery of these parameters in the \n\npostpartum period have been mainly studied with the objective of quantifying the \n\nnutritional habits of pregnant (Berggren et al., 2015; Kopp-Hoolihan et al., 1999; \n\nLarciprete et al., 2003; Lopez et al., 2011; Perez et al., 2010; Soltani &amp; Fraser, 2000), \n\nand has served as a health indicator both for the woman and fetus during pregnancy \n\n(Leddy et al., 2008; Silva &amp; Bellotto, In press; Straughen et al., 2013; Tenenbaum-\n\nGavish &amp; Hod, 2013), and both for the woman and the child after birth (Andres et al., \n\n2015; Gunderson et al., 2015; Piperata et al., 2002; Thame et al., 2007; Widen et al., \n\n2015). In chapter 5, the changes in women body composition are described. Much of \n\nthe body size changes occur with significant increases between the first and third \n\ntrimester, revealing the impact that pregnancy has on the woman's body during this \n\nevent. Although the relative amount of fat do not show significant changes between any \n\nof the collection phases, the absolute values show significant increases of fat in late \n\npregnancy, especially by the accumulated fat contribution of the skinfolds of the upper \n\nlimbs, upper torso and in the amount of fat of the lower leg. These results are curious, \n\nconsidering that the proximal regions to pelvic girdle are the main zones for fat \n\naccumulation associated with the human female. However, during pregnancy these \n\nresults suggest that the woman uses the fat stored in this region, to provide energy for \n\nthe growth and development of the fetus. As we would expect throughout pregnancy \n\nthe body mass gains and body mass index (BMI) increases significantly, and even \n\nwhen considering the end of pregnancy, the classification of these increases as within \n\nthe normal range, in a detailed analysis we found that the BMG increases are lower \n\nthan the recommendations in the first and second trimester, and in the last trimester \n\nthese gains are higher than recommended (Institute of Medicine and National \n\nResearch Council of the National Academies, 2009). This may point out the need of a \n\ncareful control of the women's weight, maintaining the nutrient intake balanced during \n\npregnancy and also a balance of caloric expenditure, in which the appropriate physical \n\nexercise may help. Overall, the morphology and body composition of the woman that \n\nhad changes, happen consistently since the beginning of pregnancy. This answers to \n\nour third experimental question and meets the sixth objective.  \n\nIn addition to this quantification, was also traced the objective of evaluate the \n\ninfluence that these parameters have on the joint kinetics of woman in the different \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \u2013 General discussion and conclusions \n\n \n\n \n93 \n\nstages of pregnancy. With this intent, twelve models were developed, comprising four \n\ngroups of independent variables: the amount of fat, the overall body weight, fat free \n\nmass and the shape of the trunk. \n\nFrom these models we can infer that higher body mass increased during the \n\nfirst trimester leads to an increased mechanical energy production of the knee \n\nextensors, showing that an excessive weight gain increase may lead to an increased \n\nmechanical loading of the knee. Similarly in the second trimester, higher values of the \n\nrelative amount of fat and of the abdominal-hips girth ratio, point to an increased \n\ninternal load of the hip, specifically in the hip joint extensor and hip external rotators \n\nmoments. However, still at this stage of pregnancy, women with a higher thigh fat area \n\ntend to have a lower absorption of mechanical energy of the hip flexors. In the third \n\ntrimester, increases of the body mass index, of the thigh and shank fat areas, and of \n\nthe body weight gain leads to increases of the mechanical load of the hip joint. In \n\ncontrast, increases of the free fat mass weight leads to decreases of the hip internal \n\nload. The two models developed in the postpartum period, show that with the increase \n\nin free fat mass weight and a greater body weight loss, there is a smaller hip flexors \n\nmoment and a lower absorption of mechanical energy of the same muscles. Three \n\nmajor conclusions can be drawn from these results: first is that these models show that \n\nbody composition induces changes mainly in the sagittal plane and transverse plane, \n\nhowever the models concerning the late pregnancy, mostly record changes in the \n\ntransverse plane, showing that the measured body changes cause disruptions in the \n\nstability of the hip joint; the second conclusion is that most models show that with the \n\nincreases of body composition there is an increase in internal load of hip joint; and the \n\nthird conclusion is that the increase in internal load only occurs during pregnancy, while \n\nthe models developed for the postpartum period show a decrease in mechanical load. \n\nThese findings lead us to answer the fourth and final experimental question and to fulfill \n\nthe seventh goal. \n\n Recommendations for practice \n\nBased on information drawn from the results, some recommendations for \n\nexercise prescription can be developed in order to improve the wellbeing of women \n\nthroughout pregnancy and allow better recovery after childbirth. The first \n\nrecommendation is the development of joint stability. With the decrease in magnitude \n\nof several peaks of joint moments and powers in the three-dimensional perspective, the \n\nstability in the joints of the lower limb is threatened. Thus, the workout in instability is \n\none of the practical recommendations that professionals of exercise and health should \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \u2013 General discussion and conclusions\n\n \n\n \n94 \n\ntake into account when they intervene with this population, in order to ensure the \n\nrespective strengthening of musculotendinous structures in the different planes of \n\nmotion.  \n\nThe second recommendation is to privilege calisthenics exercises in order to \n\npromote better adaptation to the growing increase in weight, and to improve whole \n\nbody kinetic chains during movement.  \n\nThe third and final recommendation is to use exercises with simple limb support \n\nfor development of unipedal balance, this is because most of the changes that occur in \n\npregnant women are during the single limb support phase. Not forgetting that it also \n\nbrings a decrease in the risk of falling, whose importance is evident for women. \n\n Recommendations for Future Research \n\nThis work brought new information to the scientific community, especially \n\nbecause it is a longitudinal study that comprehensively describes the joint \n\nbiomechanics of women during pregnancy and postpartum, their anthropometric \n\nchanges, and the relationship between these two matters.  \n\nHowever, it is necessary to conduct new developments in the research with this \n\nspecial population. In the continuity of this work will be explored the introduction of \n\ndifferent variabilities of walking, particularly with the addition of a light load which \n\npregnant woman has to carry, and walking with transposition of obstacles, in order to \n\nbetter understand the changes that pregnancy will promote in the mechanics of lower \n\nlimb joints. \n\nOther very important concern is the need to find new regression equations in \n\norder to determine with higher reliability the location of the right and left hip joint \n\ncenters. Although the models of Bell et al. (1989; 1990) are widely used for this \n\npurpose with this population, the anterior tilt of the pelvis and the increased abdominal \n\nvolume, certainly bring bias in the construction of biomechanical models of the \n\npregnant woman. In the same line of study and with equal importance, is the \n\nmeasurement of body density of women, not only in late pregnancy but also to \n\nunderstand how this variable evolves throughout pregnancy in order to allow better \n\nprediction of biomechanical calculations. It should be remembered that the instruments \n\nnormally used for this purpose raise ethical problems in its use with pregnant because \n\nthere is some radiation involved, or be somewhat invasive. Also worthy of note for \n\nfuture research is the need to increase the sample size in longitudinal studies covering \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \u2013 General discussion and conclusions \n\n \n\n \n95 \n\nthe participants before, during and after the pregnancy, so that it is possible to verify \n\nsome results that are not common among studies. \n\nBesides the type of biomechanical analysis included in this study, the inclusion \n\nof new tools can bring other relevant information, such as electromyography and the \n\nmeasurement of the feet center of pressure, which can address issues that continue to \n\nbe raised by the scientific community, especially in reference to muscle participation, \n\nand as regards of the limb support as pregnancy progresses and its influence on \n\nstability of their body. \n\nAnother aspect that needs further investigation is how the physical exercise \n\nprograms and the effect of physical activity levels of pregnant women have in their \n\nbiomechanical load as the pregnancy progresses. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \u2013 General discussion and conclusions\n\n \n\n \n96 \n\n References \n\nAndres, Aline, Hull, Holly R., Shankar, Kartik, Casey, Patrick H., Cleves, Mario A., &amp; \nBadger, Thomas M.

During pregnancy women experience several changes in the body\u2019s physiology, morphology, and hormonal system.\nThese changes may affect the balance and body stability and can cause discomfort and pain. The adaptations of the musculoskeletal\nsystem due to morphological changes during pregnancy are not fully understood. Few studies clarify the biomechanical changes\nof gait that occur during pregnancy and in postpartum period. Purposes. The purpose of this review was to analyze the available\nevidence on the biomechanical adaptations of gait that occur throughout pregnancy and in postpartum period, specifically with\nregard to the temporal, spatial, kinematic, and kinetic parameters of gait. Methods. Three databases were searched and 9 studies with\na follow-up design were retrieved for analysis. Results. Most studies performed temporal, spatial, and kinematic analysis. Only three\nstudies performed kinetic analysis. Conclusion. The adaptation strategies to the anatomical and physiological changes throughout\npregnancy are still unclear, particularly in a longitudinal perspective and regarding kinetic parameters.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nPregnancy is a unique time in the life of women with many\nchanges that affect the musculoskeletal system [1]. Over\n38 to 42 weeks, women experience several changes in the\nbody\u2019s physiology, morphology, and hormonal system. These\nchanges are visible especially in increased weight and skeletal\nalignment. Other less visible changes are the increased joint\nlaxity and change in the center of gravity. Altogether, these\nchanges affect the balance and body stability and can cause\ndiscomfort and pain [2]. The displacement of the center\nof gravity has been discussed over the years with different\nstatements. Some studies indicate that the center of gravity\n(CG) moves upward and anteriorly, for example, Foti et al. [3]\nand Rodacki et al. [4]. Other studies state that the CG shifts on\nthe upper and posterior direction (e.g., Fries and Hellebrandt\n[5]). Whitcome et al. [6] evaluated the evolution of lumbar\nlordosis in bipedal hominids, and the results elucidate that\nthe CG moves anteriorly until the fetus reaches 40% of\nthe expected final weight. From that moment, the woman\n\nincreases the lordotic adjustment which in turn enables the\ncontrol of the CG, but with greater biomechanical costs [3].\n\nHormonal changes in women are quite variable through-\nout pregnancy. However, the hormone relaxin may have a\nmore decisive role in the mechanics of movement, as it\nprovides greater ligament laxity in the pelvis and on the\nperipheral joints [2, 7, 8]. The concentration peak of relaxin\noccurs around the 12th week of gestation, which means that\nthere is enough time to act in osteoarticular structures until\nthe end of pregnancy.\n\nOne of the aspects that most influences the musculoskele-\ntal system is the increase in maternal weight. When weight is\nin excess it may cause several adverse maternal effects, includ-\ning gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, difficulties\nduring labor, weight retention in postpartum, and subsequent\nmaternal obesity with the risk for unsuccessful breastfeeding\n[9]. The ideal weight gain during pregnancy is related to the\nwomen\u2019s weight or body mass index (BMI) before pregnancy.\nThe weight gain may range between 12.5 Kg and 18 Kg for\nwomen under weight (BMI&lt;18.5); between 11.5 Kg and 16 Kg\nfor women with normal weight (18.5 ?BMI &lt;25); between\n\nHindawi Publishing Corporation\n?e Scientific World Journal\nVolume 2014, Article ID 527940, 5 pages\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/527940\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/527940\n\n\n2 The Scientific World Journal\n\n7 Kg and 11.5 Kg for women who are overweight (25?BMI<\n30); and between 5 Kg and 9 Kg for obese women [9]. The\nweight gain during pregnancy is related to several factors,\nsuch as the amount of blood, the increased volume of the\nbreasts, and the increased fat mass and extracellular fluid\n[6]. The fetal tissues, the placenta, and the amniotic fluid are\nrelated to the weight gain of the fetus [9].\n\nA strategy to control weight gain during pregnancy is by\nperforming structured or recreational physical activity. The\nguidelines for exercise prescription of the American College\nof Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend aerobic exer-\ncise consisting of activities that use large muscle groups in\na continuous, rhythmic manner [1]. Walking emerges as a\nhighly recommended physical activity for pregnant women.\nWalking is one of the movements most commonly performed\nby people in the day-to-day tasks and it is easy to control\nexercise intensity.\n\nWhen performing motor tasks such as walking, the adap-\ntations of the musculoskeletal system due to morphological\nchanges during pregnancy are not fully known. Few studies\nclarify the biomechanical changes of gait that occur during\npregnancy and in postpartum.\n\nThe purpose of this review was to analyze the available\nevidence on the biomechanical adaptations of gait that\noccur throughout pregnancy and in postpartum, specifically\nwith regard to the temporal, spatial, kinematic, and kinetic\nparameters of gait.\n\n2. Methods\n\n2.1. Eligibility Criteria. The review was limited to studies\nmeeting the following eligibility criteria: (1) healthy pregnant\nwomen with no history of foot, ankle, knee, musculoskele-\ntal or neuromuscular trauma, or disease; (2) women aged\nbetween 20 and 40 years; (3) studies performed in the last\n14 years; (4) studies performed by means of optoelectronic\nsystems, image analysis, force platforms, and others; (5)\noutcome measures related to biomechanical variables of\ngait, including spatial (stride length, step length, and stride\nwidth), temporal (single and double support time), kinematic\n(velocity and cadence), and kinetic (ground reaction forces,\njoint moment, and joint power) parameters; (6) study design\nincluding cross-sectional, follow-up, quasi-experimental tri-\nals, and randomized controlled trials.\n\n2.2. Information Sources. The studies were identified by\nsearching three databases\u2014ScienceDirect, PubMed, and\nSciELO\u2014from January 2000 to August 2014. In addition,\nreference lists of identified studies were also scanned. Studies\npublished in English, Portuguese, Spanish, or French were\nscanned. Only published full papers were included. Unpub-\nlished data, books, conference proceedings, or academic\ntheses were not included.\n\n2.3. Search Strategy and Study Selection. The search was\nperformed using the following keywords in English: (1)\ngait/walking; (2) pregnancy/pregnant; and (3) biomechan-\nics/kinetics/kinematics. These keywords were in first place\nidentified in the titles and in the abstracts. The study selection\n\nwas conducted in two stages. The first stage was the screening\nof the titles and abstracts against the inclusion criteria to\nidentify relevant papers. The second stage was the screening\nof the full papers to identify whether they met the eligibility\ncriteria.\n\n2.4. Data Collection Process and Analysis. After screening\neach paper, the following data were extracted: (1) study\ndesign; (2) sample size; (3) age of the women; (4) gestational\nphase of data collection; (5) outcome variables: spatial vari-\nables, temporal variables, kinematic variables, and kinetic\nvariables; (6) biomechanical instruments. The studies were,\ntherefore, described according to these characteristics and\noutcome measures.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Study Selection and Characteristics. The search yielded\n741 articles from the three databases: ScienceDirect (711),\nPubMed (28), and SciELO (2). After removing duplicate\narticles 21 articles were considered for analysis. Articles were\nthen screened on the basis of title and abstract, with 16\nexcluded. After searching the reference lists of the selected\narticles, 4 more articles were included. The remaining 9 full\npapers were examined in detail, found to meet the inclusion\ncriteria, and then included in the review.\n\nThe characteristics of the studies included in the review\nare presented in Table 1. All studies have follow-up design.\nThe sample sizes across the studies ranged from 2 [9] to\n124 [7]. All studies reported the mean age and standard\ndeviation, except one [10]. Different studies used video-\nbased systems for kinematic analysis, except for two studies\nthat use optoelectronic systems [11, 12] and one that only\nuses pedometers [7] to analyze the temporal and spatial\nparameters. Only three studies report a kinetic analysis [10,\n12, 13] and most studies provide an analysis of the kinematic,\nspatial, and temporal parameters.\n\n3.2. Outcome Measures: Spatial and Temporal Parameters.\nThe variables of stride length, step length, stride width,\nbase of support, and single and double support time are\nthe spatial and temporal parameters analyzed by the papers\nreviewed. Most papers reviewed showed changes in spatial\nand temporal parameters in late pregnancy, specifically, a\nsignificant decrease in the length of the gait cycle [11, 13\u2013\n15], and in step length [11\u201314], and a significant increase of\nthe double support time [3, 11, 14]. Other studies showed a\nsignificant reduction in the single support time [3, 14] and\na significant increase in step width [10, 15]. Forczek and\nStaszkiewicz [12] also found a significant increase of the base\nof support. Nevertheless, the remaining studies suggest that\npregnant women have the need to increase the body stability\nand use the parameters listed above to meet those demands.\n\n3.3. Outcome Measures: Joint Kinematics. The variables of\nvelocity (or speed) and cadence are the kinematic parameters\nanalyzed by the studies included in the review.

The angular displacement of the\npelvis increases in the anterior tilt of approximately 5 degrees\n[3, 13]. The joints of the lower limb in the sagittal plane show\nan increase in hip flexion during stance phase [3, 11, 13], an\nincrease of knee flexion during the terminal stance phase\n[14], a decrease of knee extension [11], and a decrease of\nankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion [11, 13]. In the frontal\nplane, Gilleard [15] found a reduction in the amplitude of the\nunilateral elevation of the pelvis. The hip joint had different\nresults considering the two studies performed: Foti et al. [3]\nfound a peak with greater magnitude in the hip adduction;\nBranco et al. [11] found a decrease of this peak.\n\n3.4. Outcome Measures: Joint Kinetics. Few studies have\nevaluated the kinetic parameters of gait during pregnancy\n\n[10, 12, 13]. Foti et al. [3] analyzed the joint moments and\njoint powers with and without normalizing the weight of\nthe women in late pregnancy. Although they found several\nchanges in these parameters without normalization, the\nauthors recommend the analysis with normalization [13]. The\nanalyses performed with normalized data found a significant\nincrease in the hip extensors moment [17] and a significant\ndecrease in the knee extensors moment [17] and in the ankle\nplantarflexors moment [3, 17] in the sagittal plane. In the\nfrontal plane, there was an increase of the hip abductors\nmoment [3] and in the knee adductors moment [17].\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThe purpose of this review was to analyze the available\nevidence on the biomechanical adaptations of gait that occur\nthroughout pregnancy and in postpartum. Data from 9\nfollow-up studies were included in the analysis.\n\n\n\n4 The Scientific World Journal\n\nWomen are subjected to various anatomical and physio-\nlogical changes throughout pregnancy. However, the adapta-\ntion strategies that are pursued are still unclear [12]. Two of\nthe situations they face are, on the one hand, the reduction\nof energy costs associated with gait and, on the other hand,\nmaximizing safety during the motor task. The later strategy\nseems to be dominant because the increase in step width\nis associated with a greater energy cost during walking\n[18]. This parameter has great consistency between studies.\nIn addition, the development of pregnancy is associated\nwith a reduction in stride length, which together allow the\nwoman to have a larger base of support [12]. Another way\nfound by pregnant women to ensure greater body stability\nis keeping their feet on the ground for a longer time during\nthe gait cycle and decreasing the single support time, which\nseems to be also a strategy to support the increased weight\n[3]. In fact, the medial-lateral instability of the women as\nthe pregnancy progresses is one result that seems to have\ngreat importance among different types of biomechanical\nparameters. However, so far the medial-lateral component of\nthe ground reaction forces shows no significant changes but\ntends to be higher in late pregnancy [10]. This observation\nrequires further research.\n\nMany of the biomechanical changes occur in the pelvis or\nin adjacent joints. Although there are few kinematic changes\nin late pregnancy, most of them are related to the angular\nmotion of the pelvis and the hip joint. The result with greater\nemphasis between studies is the anterior tilt of the pelvis.\nThe position taken by the pelvis in late pregnancy seems to\nbe a consequence of the weight of the uterus, placenta, and\nfetus placed on the anterior zone of the body and the weaker\ncapacity to produce force by the rectus abdominis. However,\nthe function of this anterior tilt and the increase of the lumbar\nlordosis are related to the maintenance of the trunk in an\nupright position [3]. The decrease in the range of motion\nof the pelvis in the frontal and transverse planes suggests\nthat this may be a way to control the angular momentum\ncaused by the increase of the moment of inertia of the trunk\nin late pregnancy [15]. These changes bring consequences\nfor the muscles attached to the pelvis, particularly a greater\nparticipation of the abductors and extensors muscles of the\nhip, which, combined with a higher stretch derived from\nthe anterior tilt of the pelvis, will contribute to lower back,\npelvis, hip, and sacroiliac pain [3, 17]. These types of pain\nare also associated with a decrease in the participation of\nthe knee extensors and ankle plantarflexors [17]. The changes\nin angular motion of the ankle may also be associated with\nother issues of pregnant women, including a decrease of\ndorsiflexion that is related to pain and higher probability to\ntrip and fall [13].\n\nLimitations. The strength of this review is that a systematic\nmethodology was adopted to identify relevant studies on\nthe biomechanics of gait during pregnancy. However, the\nreview has some limitations. Articles published in languages\nother than those mentioned above may have been excluded.\nThe search was performed only in peer-reviewed published\narticles since 2000. There is a possibility of missing data\npublished previously or other unpublished data that were\n\nnot included in the analysis. The small sample sizes and\nthe different periods of data collection may have introduced\nsome bias in the analysis performed. The lack of studies\nabout this subject as well as the consistency of the outcome\nmeasures is a major limitation to perform a meta-analysis.\nCautions should be taken when drawing conclusions about\ngait adaptions throughout pregnancy, due to the limitations\nmentioned above.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nThe evidence from this review suggests biomechanical adap-\ntations of gait throughout pregnancy. Further research is\nrequired using common outcome measures and standard\nfollow-up periods of data collection (weeks of gestation and\npostpartum period). Most of the results presented in this\nreview are consistent between studies. However, there is a\ngreat scarcity of studies addressing the gait biomechanics of\npregnant women in a longitudinal perspective. There is a\nneed to examine closely the kinematics of the woman while\nwalking considering the beginning of pregnancy, in order\nto confirm the influence of morphological changes in the\nangular motion of the lower limb segments during the course\nof pregnancy.\n\nVery few studies analyzed the kinetics of gait of pregnant\nwomen. Nevertheless, these data are seen as essential to\nunderstand the magnitude and implications of changes in\nthe welfare of women. In future research, there must be a\nspecial focus on the analysis of moments and joint powers to\nunderstand the changes in muscle participation and if there\nare changes in the type of contraction during motor tasks.\n\nIt is not possible to understand the influence of mor-\nphological changes, if body composition and anthropometric\nvariables are not quantified throughout pregnancy. Further\nresearch is required to understand to which extent do these\nvariables influence the biomechanical parameters.\n\nNo studies were found addressing the effects of physical\nactivity, low back, and pelvic pain or maternal weight control\non the gait biomechanical adaptations of gait throughout\npregnancy and postpartum.\n\nConflict of Interests\n\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interests\nregarding the publication of this paper.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work is supported by European Union, QREN-\nInAlentejo-Programa Operacional do Alentejo, 2007\u20132013/\nNational Strategic Reference Framework, project title\nParque de Cie?ncia e Tecnologia do Alentejo, Laborato?rio de\nInvestigac?a?o em Desporto e Sau?de/Alentejo\u2019s Science and\nTechnology Park, Sport and Health Research Center, Instituto\nPolite?cnico de Santare?m, Escola Superior de Desporto de Rio\nMaior/Escola Superior de Sau?de de Santare?m/Polytechnic\nInstitute of Santare?m, and Sport Sciences School of Rio\nMaior/Health School of Santare?m.

The purposes were to describe and quantify the spatial,\ntemporal and kinematic parameters in the joints of the lower limb during gait at the end of the first, second and\nthird trimesters of pregnancy and in the postpartum period.\n\nMethods\nA three-dimensional analysis was performed in eleven pregnant women. Repeated measures ANOVA were\nperformed for comparisons between periods.\n\nResults\nThe longitudinal effect of pregnancy was not observed in spatial and temporal parameters. In joint kinematics\nthe effect of pregnancy was observed in all joints for the three planes of motion. The hip joint and pelvis are the\nstructures with more changes, and the results point to an increase in the anterior tilt of the pelvis as the\npregnancy progresses, as well as a decrease of the amplitudes of the hip joint. The results suggested that\npregnant women need to maintain the stability of the body, and become more efficient in locomotion.\n\nConclusions\nIn general the results retrieve the values from the beginning of pregnancy, indicating that the body was self-\norganized in order to overcome the morphological and physiological changes which women suffer during\npregnancy, indicating that they have the ability to adapt depending on the demands, and after the effect of\npregnancy is over, they return to values similar to those found in early pregnancy.\n\nAuthors:\n\nProf. Marco  Ant\u00f3nio Cola\u00e7o Branco Sport Science School of Rio Maior, Polythecnic Institute of Rio\nMaior, Portugal\n\nNeuromechanics of Human Movement Research Group\nLaboratory of Biomechanics and Functional Morphology\nInterdisciplinary Centre for the Study of Human Performance\n\nProf. Rita Santos-Rocha Sport Science School of Rio Maior, Polythecnic Institute of Rio\nMaior, Portugal\n\nNeuromechanics of Human Movement Research Group\nLaboratory of Biomechanics and Functional Morphology\nInterdisciplinary Centre for the Study of Human Performance\n\nProf. Filomena Vieira Neuromechanics of Human Movement Research Group\nLaboratory of Biomechanics and Functional Morphology\nInterdisciplinary Centre for the Study of Human Performance\nFaculty of Human Kinetics, University of Lisbon\n\nProf. Liliana Aguiar Neuromechanics of Human Movement Research Group\nLaboratory of Biomechanics and Functional Morphology\n\nhttp://www.editorialsystem.com/abb\nhttp://www.editorialsystem.com/\n\n\nInterdisciplinary Centre for the Study of Human Performance\nFaculty of Human Kinetics, University of Lisbon, Portugal\n\nProf. Ant\u00f3nio  Prieto Veloso Neuromechanics of Human Movement Research Group\nLaboratory of Biomechanics and Functional Morphology\nInterdisciplinary Centre for the Study of Human Performance\nFaculty of Human Kinetics, University of Lisbon, Portugal\n\nKeywords:\n\npregnancy, biomechanics, joint kinematics, temporal and spatial parameters\n\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\n\nhttp://www.editorialsystem.com/abb\nhttp://www.editorialsystem.com/\n\n\nManuscript body\nDownload source file (93.43 kB)\n\n1 \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\nPregnant women undergo various changes during pregnancy, including hormonal and \n\nmorphological changes [1]. Although, these changes may lead to many complaints, discomfort \n\nand pain in lower limbs, it is unclear whether the biological, hormonal and morphologic a l \n\nchanges lead to the modification of gait pattern. Few studies describe the temporal, spatial and \n\nkinematic motion on the lower limb of the pregnant women, particularly in a longitud ina l \n\nperspective. \n\nFoti, Davids [7] analyzed a set of gait three-dimensional (3D) kinematic parameter in \n\n15 women, from the 3t h trimester of pregnancy until one year postpartum. The overall results \n\nshowed changes in the gait pattern of those women, comparing with a non-pregnant group. In \n\nthe pregnant group gait pattern the amplitude of hip extension is decreased while the anterior \n\npelvic tilt, hip flexion and hip adduction are increased. Regarding temporal parameters \n\nsignificant increases were found in double support time and significant decreases in single \n\nsupport time. In spatial parameters they found a significant increase for pelvic width and ankle \n\nseparation. Lymbery and Gilleard [12] investigated the temporospatial and ground reaction \n\nforces (GRF) variables in the stance phase of walking on 13 women at 38 weeks\u2019 gestation and \n\n8 weeks after birth. They concluded that in late pregnancy, there was a wider step width, and \n\nmediolateral GRF increasing in a medial direction. They suggested that women may adapt their \n\ngait to maximize stability in the stance phase of walking and to control mediolateral motion. \n\nHuang, Lin [10] compared the natural pattern of walking, tested once, in 10 pregnant women, \n\ndivided into three groups (12, 13-28 and 29-40 weeks of gestation) with of control group of 10 \n\nnulliparous. They reported significant differences between the pregnant and non-pregnant \n\nwomen, especially in knee abduction angle, knee and hip internal rotation angles. Also, as \n\ngestational age progress, the pregnant women showed increased in hip extension moment and \n\nknee adduction moment, and decreased in knee extension moment, and ankle plantar flexio n \n\nmoment. According to these authors the hip is the main work-loading area, associated with an \n\nover stretch of the hip extensors, which are highly related with sacroiliac pain, caused by an \n\neasily fatigue of these muscles. \n\nFew studies analyzed gait kinematic changes throughout pregnancy, in each trimester \n\nof gestation, or associated the kinematic and kinetic variables for each phase of the gait cycle. \n\nIn a previous study Branco, Santos-Rocha [4] found that the gait pattern of pregnant women \n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n29\n\n30\n\n31\n\n32\n\nhttp://www.editorialsystem.com/pdf/download/251246/71603a1726488ae1412b885b410ea401/\nhttp://www.editorialsystem.com/abb\nhttp://www.editorialsystem.com/\n\n\nManuscript body\nDownload source file (93.43 kB)\n\n2 \n\n \n\nshowed changes between second and third trimesters in such a way that the stride and right and  \n\nleft step lengths decreased, while double limb support time increased. Joint kinematics showed \n\na significant decrease of right-hip extension and adduction during stance phase between \n\ntrimesters. Also, an increase in left knee flexion and a decrease in right-ankle plantarfle xio n \n\nwere found between trimesters. \n\nNo studies were found performing a longitudinal analysis encompassing the three \n\ntrimesters of pregnancy and the postpartum period, so that the changes that arising from \n\npregnancy are not fully quantified. These leads us to wonder whether there are changes in \n\nkinematic parameters during pregnancy, and if so, are women able to recover to values close to \n\nthose found in early pregnancy? \n\nThe main objective of this study was to analyze the kinematic changes of gait as the \n\npregnancy progresses. If these changes were confirmed, the second objective was to ascertain \n\nwhether women can recover to the initial kinematic patterns in the postpartum period. The \n\nhypothesis tested is that the gait of pregnant women has changes in the kinematic parameters \n\nthroughout their pregnancy, and women in postpartum period recover these parameters to \n\nvalues similar to those of early pregnancy. To achieve the main objective, it is necessary to \n\ndescribe the kinematic variables in the joints of the lower limb during gait at the end of the first, \n\nsecond and third trimesters of pregnancy and in the postpartum period. \n\n \n\nMaterials and Methods \n\nSubjects \n\nEleven pregnant women (age: 33.20 \u00b1 1.62 years; range: 32 to 37 years) with no trauma \n\nor disease history of foot, ankle, knee, musculoskeletal, and neuromuscular, participated in this \n\nstudy.

None of the participants had \n\ncontraindications to physical exercise. The study was approved by the ethical committee of the \n\nFaculty of Human Kinetics, University of Lisbon (FMH-UL) and all subjects gave written \n\ninformed consent prior to the participation in the study. \n\n \n\nData Collection and Processing \n\nData were collected at the Laboratory of Biomechanics and Functional Morphology \n\n(FMH-UL) during the later stages of each trimester of pregnancy and once between the 4t h and \n\nthe 6t h month after delivery. In each data collection session anthropometric and biomechanic a l \n\ndata were recorded. The weight and height were measured according to the Internatio na l \n\nSociety for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK) standardized measurement protocol \n\n[15] by ISAK certified anthropometrists. These anthropometric data were used to calculate the \n\nbody segments mass and inertia moments.  \n\nThe biomechanical data were recorded while the subject walked barefoot a distance of \n\n10 m, between two points, in a straight line in both directions at a natural and comfortable \n\nspeed, during 3 min. Participants were allowed to get familiar with the laboratory system and \n\nno fatigue occurrence was reported. The last four gait cycles performed by each participant \n\nwere considered for the analysis. \n\nMarkers setup were in agreement with the suggestion of Cappozzo, Cappello [5], for \n\nlower limb segments, and CODA (Charnwood Dynamics Ltd, Leicestershire, United Kingdom) \n\nprotocols for model of the pelvis segment (Fig. 1). Pelvis model allows the estimation of the \n\nright and left hip joint center using the regression equation proposed by Bell, Brand [2] and \n\nBell, Pedersen [3]. Planar motion of the hip, knee and ankle joint was calculated with Visual \n\n3D (V3D) software (C-Motion Inc., Germantown, USA) by a computational procedure \n\nimplementing the dot product between the skeletal segments articulated by these joints. \n\n \n\n62\n\n63\n\n64\n\n65\n\n66\n\n67\n\n68\n\n69\n\n70\n\n71\n\n72\n\n73\n\n74\n\n75\n\n76\n\n77\n\n78\n\n79\n\n80\n\n81\n\n82\n\n83\n\n84\n\n85\n\n86\n\n87\n\n88\n\n89\n\nhttp://www.editorialsystem.com/pdf/download/251246/71603a1726488ae1412b885b410ea401/\nhttp://www.editorialsystem.com/abb\nhttp://www.editorialsystem.com/\n\n\nManuscript body\nDownload source file (93.43 kB)\n\n4 \n\n \n\nFig. 1.

The capture hardware was connected to Qualisys USB Analog \n\nAcquisition interface in order to synchronize kinetic and kinematic data with software Qualisys \n\nTrack Manager (QTM; Qualisys AB, Gothenburg, Sweden). Both data sequences were \n\nrecorded in the same file. The system was calibrated by wand type, with an exact wand length \n\nof 751.4 mm moved randomly across the recorded field, before the data collection of each \n\nparticipant. Calibration was accepted if the standard deviation of the wands length measures \n\nwas below 0.5 mm. The cameras were positioned statically to minimize light reflection artifacts \n\nand to allow recording of at least two consecutive walking cycles, defined as the time between \n\ntwo consecutive initial ground contacts of the heel strike for each side.  \n\nA three-dimensional analysis was performed including both sides of the body. The \n\ntrajectory of the reflective markers was smoothed using a Butterworth low-pass filter with a 10 \n\nHz cut-off. Collected data were interpolated using a Cubic Spline Interpolation as suggested by \n\nRobertson, Caldwell [14], for a maximum of 10 frames gap, and filtered with a Butterworth \n\ndigital low-pass filter, at 10 Hz cutoff frequency for kinematic and kinetic data, as suggested \n\nby Robertson and Dowling [13]. All data were normalized in time. \n\nConsidering the four phases in analysis, kinematic pattern curves were estimated \n\nrelative to the walking stride cycle. The gait cycles were selected based on both feet GRF data \n\nand the heel markers pattern recognition followed by correction when needed. The data curves \n\nand the peak angles values were estimated, for left and right sides, with Visual 3D software \n\n(V3D). Lower-extremity joint angles and spatial and temporal parameters during the walking \n\ngait cycle were calculated with use of V3D. \n\nIn each trimester of pregnancy and in the postpartum period were considered a set of kinemat ic \n\nvariables, which analyzed peaks are described in our previous study [4]. \n\n90\n\n91\n\n92\n\n93\n\n94\n\n95\n\n96\n\n97\n\n98\n\n99\n\n100\n\n101\n\n102\n\n103\n\n104\n\n105\n\n106\n\n107\n\n108\n\n109\n\n110\n\n111\n\n112\n\n113\n\n114\n\n115\n\n116\n\n117\n\n118\n\nhttp://www.editorialsystem.com/pdf/download/251246/71603a1726488ae1412b885b410ea401/\nhttp://www.editorialsystem.com/abb\nhttp://www.editorialsystem.com/\n\n\nManuscript body\nDownload source file (93.43 kB)\n\n5 \n\n \n\n  \n\nStatistical Analysis \n\nAll statistical procedures were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics 22 software for \n\nWindows.

Bold values rep resent statistical differences. \n\nThe first peak of the hip joint in the transverse plane has a slight but significant increase \n\nin internal rotation of the thigh from the first to the second and third trimesters. However, from \n\nthe second and third trimesters to postpartum, continues to be a significant increase, both \n\nincreases are between two and three degrees of internal rotation of the hip. \n\nDiscussion \n\nThe main goal of this longitudinal study was to describe the changes on the gait \n\nbiomechanical parameters throughout pregnancy and in postpartum period. The 3D analysis of \n\nkinematic parameters as well as of spatial and temporal parameters was performed. The \n\nhypothesis that these parameters are influenced by the course of pregnancy is rejected for the \n\nspatial and temporal variables during walking, and accepted for the kinematic variables in the \n\nthree planes of motion. In our previous study [4] and in Foti, Davids [7] found higher values in \n\nthe stride width and in the double support time for third trimester, when compared to the values \n\nfound in the postpartum or in control group, respectively, and are largely influenced by the \n\nstage of pregnancy. However, even without significant changes in this study, the stride width \n\nwas 1.4 cm larger in the third trimester than in early pregnancy, and decreases in postpartum, \n\nand the double support time also features the inverted U-shaped, with an increase of 0.17 \n\nseconds between the first and the third trimesters and a decrease from the third trimester to \n\npostpartum of 0.20 seconds, which seems to point to the same behavior as the literature.

In the sagittal plane, the knee, hip, and the segment of the pelvis present the major \n\nchanges during pregnancy. There are few studies in the literature that referred knee changes \n\nduring pregnancy and postpartum. Our results are in line with Carpes, Griebeler [6] that found \n\na significant increase in knee flexion in the terminal stance phase, and with our previous study \n\n[4]. We also found a decrease in knee extension during the end of swing phase, which may be \n\nthe result of a lower participation of the knee extensors. This may be associated to back pain, \n\nspecifically with sacroiliac pain, referred by pregnant women [10].  \n\nThe hip joint has been referenced in the literature as the joint where major changes occur \n\nin late pregnancy. In our study an increase of flexion of the hip during stance phase was found \n\nwhich is supported by previous studies [4, 7, 9], leaving effectively no peak of hip extension \n\nduring pre-swing phase.  \n\nThe published results about the pelvis are consistent across the studies, showing an \n\nincreased anterior tilt of five degrees throughout the gait cycle [7, 9]. In this study, in addition \n\nto assessing the significant increase in this anterior tilt, we discriminate that this increase occurs, \n\nbetween the first and second trimesters and remained similar between the second and third \n\ntrimesters, as previously observed [4]. This pelvis position, seems to agree with the \n\nmorphological changes already undertaken by pregnant women in the end of the second \n\ntrimester, where there are an increase in abdominal volume and weight of the fetus that affects \n\nabout 40% of its final weight [16], combined with a lower capacity for force production by \n\nrectus abdominis. However, Foti, Davids [7] states that the function of the anterior pelvic tilt, \n\ncombined with an increase of lumbar lordosis is to keep the body in an upright position. After \n\ndelivery, between the fourth and sixth months, there is a significant reduction in the pelvic \n\nanterior tilt angle similar to those found in the first trimester which seems to be an indicator of \n\nthe recovery of the pelvis position in postpartum, also observed in the literature between \n\npregnancy and the postpartum [4, 7, 9]. Regarding the sagittal plane, the results confirmed that \n\nthe angular data show deviations associated with pregnancy and are recovered in the postpartum \n\nperiod. \n\n273\n\n274\n\n275\n\n276\n\n277\n\n278\n\n279\n\n280\n\n281\n\n282\n\n283\n\n284\n\n285\n\n286\n\n287\n\n288\n\n289\n\n290\n\n291\n\n292\n\n293\n\n294\n\n295\n\n296\n\n297\n\n298\n\n299\n\n300\n\n301\n\n302\n\n303\n\n304\n\nhttp://www.editorialsystem.com/pdf/download/251246/71603a1726488ae1412b885b410ea401/\nhttp://www.editorialsystem.com/abb\nhttp://www.editorialsystem.com/\n\n\nManuscript body\nDownload source file (93.43 kB)\n\n13 \n\n \n\nIn the frontal plane, there are influences of the stage of pregnancy on the angular data, \n\nrevealing significant changes in the ankle, hip and pelvis segment. Few studies have examined \n\nthe frontal plane changes. Gilleard [8] found a reduction in the amplitude of the unilater a l \n\nelevation of the pelvis. In this study, during the mid-stance, there was an increase of the \n\nmagnitude of the fall of the pelvis from the third trimester to the postpartum period. During the \n\ntoe-off, the pelvis shows a slight decrease in elevation between the first and second trimester s, \n\nand an increased elevation of the pelvis between the first and the third trimesters. Both results \n\nsuggest that, in late pregnancy, the dynamic of the two angular peaks of the pelvis is related to \n\nthe attempt to control the angular momentum of the trunk caused by the increase of its moment \n\nof inertia [8]. In the hip joint, this study showed a decrease in the hip adduction during the mid -\n\nstance phase, between the first and third trimesters. In a previous study, [4] we found a similar \n\nresults between the second and third trimesters and between pregnant and non-pregnant women. \n\nHowever, Foti, Davids [7] points to a contradictory result, showing an increase in hip adduction \n\nbetween participants at the end of pregnancy and one year after delivery. The ankle joint showed \n\nno changes in the frontal plane in the literature [4]. In this study, however, there are signific a nt \n\nchanges in the pre-swing phase, with an increase of ankle inversion from the first to the third \n\ntrimester and to the postpartum period, showing that this parameter does not recover and \n\nremains at least up to six months after delivery. The ankle inversion between the first and third \n\ntrimesters keeps significantly increased until the mid-swing phase, showing that both stance as \n\nthe swing phases of the pregnant woman are with an increased inversion of the foot during \n\npregnancy. Since the changes only occur between the first and third trimester, and remain in \n\nthe postpartum, justifies the fact that it has not been found in previous studies, which only \n\nstudied women since the end of the second trimester. In the frontal plane, the hypothesis that \n\nthe data show angular deviations associated with pregnancy, is accepted for the above variables. \n\nHowever, the hypothesis that these variables retake the values of early pregnancy is not \n\naccepted only for the inversion of the ankle, which keeps increased up to the postpartum period.  \n\nThe kinematic parameters in transverse plane remains largely unchanged during \n\npregnancy and postpartum, however there is an increase in the hip internal rotation from the \n\nfirst to the second and to the third trimester. In the postpartum period there is a continuo us \n\nincrease in internal rotation during the terminal stance phase. According to Los Amigos \n\nResearch Education Institute Inc, Service [11], the internal rotation of the hip during the single \n\nsupport, is associated with an internal rotation contracture, femoral anteversion or an intent io n \n\n305\n\n306\n\n307\n\n308\n\n309\n\n310\n\n311\n\n312\n\n313\n\n314\n\n315\n\n316\n\n317\n\n318\n\n319\n\n320\n\n321\n\n322\n\n323\n\n324\n\n325\n\n326\n\n327\n\n328\n\n329\n\n330\n\n331\n\n332\n\n333\n\n334\n\n335\n\n336\n\n337\n\nhttp://www.editorialsystem.com/pdf/download/251246/71603a1726488ae1412b885b410ea401/\nhttp://www.editorialsystem.com/abb\nhttp://www.editorialsystem.com/\n\n\nManuscript body\nDownload source file (93.43 kB)\n\n14 \n\n \n\nto increase knee stability, leading to a toe-in position, hindering the forward advancement and \n\nmay increase pressure on the lateral side of the knee joint. Regarding transverse plane, the \n\nhypothesis that the data show angular deviations associated with pregnancy, is rejected for most \n\nvariables except for internal rotation of the hip. This variable, however, does not return the \n\nvalues of early pregnancy, rejecting that hypothesis, by remaining increased until the last \n\nmoment of collection. \n\n \n\nConclusions \n\nThis study followed a descriptive longitudinal type design, in which pregnant women \n\nwere assessed in the first, second and third trimesters of pregnancy and also in postpartum \n\nperiod. The gait analysis showed that pregnancy is a factor which influences the kinemat ic \n\nvariables of the lower limb joints. The pelvis and hip joint are the segments that experience \n\ngreater changes throughout pregnancy. Changes in the sagittal plane indicate that there is \n\ngreater care in the anterior progression of the body. However the temporal and spatial data \n\nreveal no significant changes over the gait cycle. In the remaining planes of motion, there is \n\nless amplitude of motor actions, which seem to indicate greater constraints on movement. In \n\ngeneral the results retrieve the values from the beginning of pregnancy, indicating that the body \n\nwas self-organized in order to overcome the morphological and physiological changes which \n\nwomen suffer during pregnancy and that has the ability to adapt depending on the demands. \n\nOther questions are raised by these results, in particular if these kinematic changes bring an \n\noverload to the musculoskeletal system of the pregnant woman and its association with \n\nlumbopelvic pain.  \n\nSupporting grants \n\nThe present publication was supported by the following projects:  \n\n(1) Funder: FCT \u2013 Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia / Portuguese Foundation for \n\nScience and Technology.

Nevertheless, these adaptations of\ngait are still not fully understood. The purpose was to determine the effect of pregnancy on the biomechanical pattern of walking,\nregarding the kinetic parameters. A three-dimensional analysis was performed in eleven participants. The kinetic parameters in\nthe joints of the lower limb during gait were compared at the end of the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy and in the\npostpartum period, in healthy pregnant women. The main results showed a reduction in the normalized vertical reaction forces,\nthroughout pregnancy, particularly the third peak. Pregnant women showed, during most of the stance phase, medial reaction forces\nas a motor response to promote the body stability. Bilateral changes were observed in hip joint, with a decrease in the participation\nof the hip extensors and in the eccentric contraction of hip flexors. In ankle joint a decrease in the participation of ankle plantar\nflexors was found. In conclusion, the overall results point to biomechanical adjustments that showed a decrease of the mechanical\nload of women throughout pregnancy, with exception for few unilateral changes of hip joint moments.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nDuring the normal development of pregnancy, women expe-\nrience a variety of morphological and physiological changes,\nas well as a continuous increase in body weight [1, 2].\nHowever, the dynamics of the load that women experience\nand how this weight gain influence everyday tasks, such as\nwalking, are not fully described. Walking is widely used not\nonly as a mean of locomotion, but also as a mode of exercise,\nespecially recommended throughout pregnancy and without\ncontraindications for pregnant women [3].\n\nThe ground reaction forces (GRF) have been widely\nstudied in the characterization of walking; however, only\nin the last two decades these parameters were studied in\npregnant women. The importance of these parameters to\ninvestigate the stability and possible causes of falls in pregnant\nwomen has been the focus of recent studies. Lymbery and\n\nGilleard [4] concluded that in late pregnancy the mediolateral\nGRF tended to be increased in a medial direction along with\na wider step width, suggesting that women may adapt their\ngait to maximize stability in the stance phase of walking\nand to control mediolateral motion. Branco et al. [5], in a\nprevious study, analyzed the tridimensional adaptations of\nkinetic parameters between the second and third trimesters\nof twenty-four pregnant women and with a control group.\nMost of the results reveal significant changes between preg-\nnancy stages and nonpregnant group, reporting a decrease of\nthe mechanical load of pregnant women, specifically with a\nlower magnitude in the third peak of vertical GRF and in\nthe second peak of anterior component of GRF, and most\nof the stance phase has a medial GRF. According to Abu\nOsman and Ghazali [6] and McCrory et al. [7] no changes\nwere found for GRF in the collected groups. However, in\nmost studies only the last stages of pregnancy were considered\n\nHindawi Publishing Corporation\nScientifica\nVolume 2015, Article ID 580374, 14 pages\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/580374\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/580374\n\n\n2 Scientifica\n\n(with the exception of Abu Osman and Ghazali [6] and Inanir\net al. [8]), not getting clearly defined if there is any influence\nof pregnancy condition on these variables, and if these\nchanges happen gradually from the beginning of pregnancy.\nSuch as the GRF, the joint kinetics is mostly studied in\nthe last two trimesters of pregnancy or between the end\nof pregnancy and postpartum (with exception for the study\nof Huang et al. [9]). Foti et al. [10] regarding this analysis,\nwhich reported significant increases in hip and ankle kinetics\nduring pregnancy). Their findings show that during preg-\nnancy there may be an increased demand placed on the hip\nabductors, hip extensors, and ankle plantarflexors muscles\nduring walking. Branco et al. [5] analyze the tridimensional\nadaptations of kinetic parameters between the second and\nthird trimesters of twenty-four pregnant women and with a\ncontrol group. Most of the changes reveal significant changes\nbetween pregnancy stages and nonpregnant group. In the\njoint moments they found a decrease in hip flexors, knee\nextensors, ankle dorsiflexors, and ankle evertors\u2019 moment and\nan increase in the participation of hip external rotators during\nloading response phase of pregnant women. In the joint\npowers they found significant decreases in the absorption of\nmechanical energy of hip flexors and significant decreases in\nthe production of mechanical energy of the hip abductors\nand in the ankle plantarflexors. An increase in the production\nof mechanical energy was found for hip extensors and hip\nexternal rotators. Huang et al. [9] compared the gait pattern\nof nonpregnant and pregnant women divided into three\ngroups, respectively: 12 weeks, 13\u201328 weeks, and 29\u201340 weeks\nof gestation, which were tested only once. They reported\nsignificant differences between the pregnant and nonpreg-\nnant women, especially in knee abduction angle, knee and\nhip internal rotation angles, hip extension moment, and hip\npower. Also, as gestational age increased, the pregnant group\nincreased hip extension moment, decreased knee extension\nmoment, increased knee adduction moment, and decreased\nankle plantar flexion moment. It is not clear however, in the\ndifferent studies (with the exception of Branco et al. [5]),\nif these changes occur bilaterally, occur only unilaterally, or\ncorrespond to average values between sides.\n\nThus, the main purpose of this study was to assess the\ngait kinetics, in order to check if there are any changes in\nthe dynamics of the load of women from the beginning of\npregnancy until the postpartum period. To achieve the main\nobjective, it was necessary to describe and quantify the kinetic\nvariables, regarding GRF, joints moment of force, and joints\npower, of ankle, knee, and hip, during gait, at the end of the\nfirst, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy and in the\npostpartum period.\n\nWe tested the hypothesis that the GRF, joints moment,\nand joints power parameters exhibit deviations along the\npregnancy and are associated with this special phase of life,\nwhich are recovered in the postpartum period.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\n2.1. Subjects. Eleven pregnant women, aged between 32 and\n37 years (33.20 \u00b1 1.62 years), with height between 1.60 and\n\n1.73 meters (1.64 \u00b1 0.04 m), with no history of foot, ankle,\nknee, musculoskeletal, and neuromuscular trauma or disease,\nparticipated in this study. The participants have the following\ncharacteristics of weight and weeks of gestation (wk) in the\nfour periods of data collection: (1) first trimester: 61.1\u00b16.6 kg\nand 14.2 \u00b1 2.4 wk; (2) second trimester: 66.6 \u00b1 8.5 kg and\n27.3 \u00b1 1.0 wk; (3) third trimester: 71.0 \u00b1 8.0 kg and 36.3 \u00b1\n0.9 wk; and (4) postpartum period: 62.4\u00b1 7.4 kg and 20.6\u00b1\n5.2 weeks after birth.\n\nThe participants were recruited via direct contact and\nflyers placed in gym and health centres and have volunteered\nto participate in the study. None of the participants had con-\ntraindication to physical exercise. All subjects gave written\ninformed consent prior to the participation in the study.\n\n2.2. Data Collection and Processing. The study was approved\nby the ethical committee of the Faculty of Human Kinet-\nics (University of Lisbon) and data were collected at the\nLaboratory of Biomechanics and Functional Morphology, in\nfour periods: during the later stages of the first, second, and\nthird trimesters of gestation and in the postpartum period.\nBefore performing the motor task, anthropometric data was\nmeasured (weight and height), according to the International\nSociety for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK)\nstandardized measurement protocol [11] by ISAK certified\nanthropometrists, to calculate the body segment masses and\ninertia moments.\n\nIn order to collect static and dynamic data trials, spherical\nreflective markers were placed on the skin on both sides of the\nlower body with double-sided adhesive tape. Markers setup\nis in agreement with the suggestion of Cappozzo et al. [12],\nfor lower limb segments, and CODA (Charnwood Dynamics\nLtd., Leicestershire, UK) protocols for model of the pelvis\nsegment.\n\nThe motor task was to walk barefoot a distance of 10\nmeters between two points, in a straight line in both direc-\ntions at a natural and comfortable speed, during 3 minutes,\nstopping and starting the path in the opposite direction.\nThe floor had no specific patterns or irregularities, and the\nparticipants had no knowledge about the location of force\nplatforms, which were placed in the middle of the defined\ndistance. Participants were allowed to get familiar with the\nlaboratory system and no fatigue occurrence was reported.\n\nPlanar motion of the hip, knee, and ankle joints was\ncalculated with Visual 3D (V3D) software (C-Motion Inc.,\nGermantown, USA) by a computational procedure imple-\nmenting the dot product between the skeletal segments\narticulated by these joints.\n\nKinematic data were collected through twelve infrared\nhigh-speed cameras (Oqus-300, Qualisys, Sweden) at a rate of\n200 Hz, and kinetic data were collected with two Kistler force\nplatforms (Kistler AG, Winterthur, Switzerland) of 0.60 m\u00d7\n0.40 m and one AMTI platform (Advanced Mechanical\nTechnology, Inc., Watertown) of 0.90 m \u00d7 0.60 m, at a rate\nof 1000 Hz. The capture hardware was connected to Qualisys\nUSB Analog Acquisition interface in order to synchronize\nkinetic and kinematic data with software Qualisys Track\nManager (QTM; Qualisys AB, Gothenburg, Sweden). Both\ndata sequences were recorded in the same file. The system\n\n\n\nScientifica 3\n\nwas calibrated by wand type, with an exact wand length\nof 751.4 mm moved randomly across the recorded field,\nbefore the data collection of each participant. Calibration was\naccepted if the standard deviation of the wand\u2019s length mea-\nsures was below 0.5 mm. Cameras were positioned statically\nto minimize light reflection artefacts and to allow recording\nof at least two consecutive walking cycles, defined as the time\nbetween two consecutive initial ground contacts of the heel\nstrike with each foot. The last four cycles within the period of\nthree minutes performed by each participant were considered\nfor the analysis.\n\nA three-dimensional (3D) analysis was performed inclu-\nding both sides of the body. The trajectory of the reflective\nmarkers was smoothed using a Butterworth low-pass filter\nwith a 10 Hz cutoff. Collected data were interpolated using\na Cubic Spline Interpolation as suggested by Robertson et\nal. [13], for a maximum of 10 frames gap, and filtered with a\nButterworth digital low-pass filter, at 10 Hz cutoff frequency\nfor kinematic and kinetic data, as suggested by Robertson and\nDowling [14]. All data were normalized in time. The setup of\nmarkers used is described in our previous study [15].\n\nConsidering the four time phases in analysis, kinetic\npattern curves of the three components of the GRF were\nnormalized to units of bodyweight and were estimated\nrelative to the total time of contact of the foot on the ground.\nThese data curves and peak values were estimated for left\nand right sides, with Visual 3D software (C-Motion, Inc.,\nGermantown, USA).\n\nThe net joint moments and powers of the ankle, knee,\nand hip were calculated using an inverse dynamics approach,\nconsidering an???Cardan sequence for joint angles, and\nresolved for the proximal segment\u2019s coordinate system [16]\nin Visual 3D software. For kinetic parameters, initial foot\ncontact was collected at the time corresponding to first\ncontact of the foot on the floor, while final contact was\ncollected with the last contact of the foot on the floor.\n\nIn the four periods under analysis, the following variables\nof the GRF curves were analyzed: three peaks characterize\nthe vertical component, two peaks characterize the anterior-\nposterior component, and two peaks characterize the medial-\nlateral component.\n\nThe joints\u2019 moments\u2019 patterns were the following: the hip\nmoment is characterized by two peaks in the sagittal plane,\ntwo peaks in the frontal plane, and one peak in the transverse\nplane. The knee moment is characterized by three peaks in\nthe sagittal plane. The ankle moment is characterized by two\npeaks in the sagittal plane, one peak in the frontal plane, and\ntwo peaks in the transverse plane.\n\nThe joints\u2019 power patterns were the following: the hip\npower is characterized by two peaks in the sagittal plane, three\npeaks in the frontal plane, and two peaks in the transverse\nplane. The knee power is characterized by three peaks in the\nsagittal plane. The ankle power is characterized by two peaks\nin the sagittal plane, two peaks in the frontal plane, and two\npeaks in the transverse plane.\n\n2.3. Statistical Analysis. All statistical procedures were con-\nducted using IBM SPSS Statistics 22 software for Win-\ndows. Shapiro-Wilk normality tests were conducted and not\n\nassumed for all cases. The Mauchly\u2019s test of sphericity was\nperformed before Repeated Measures (RM) analysis and\nsphericity was not assumed in all tests. For post hoc tests,\nthe Bonferroni test was used based on Student\u2019s ? statistic,\nadjusting the observed significance level for the fact that\nmultiple comparisons were made. For variables and groups\nwhich did not commit all assumptions of RM analysis, the\nFriedman test was performed, as well as the Wilcoxon test\nin the case of pairwise analysis. In this case, Bonferroni\nconfidence interval adjustment was applied to allow an\nadjustment to the confidence intervals and significance values\nfor multiple comparisons.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Ground Reaction Forces. Most of the components of the\nGRF are influenced by the stage of pregnancy, particularly in\nthe three peaks of the vertical component, in the two peaks of\nthe anterior-posterior component, and at the first peak of the\nmedial-lateral component of GRF (Figure 1).\n\nThe descriptive statistics of the GRF can be found in\nTable 1. Our results suggest a decrease of GRF in late preg-\nnancy.\n\nThe first and second peaks of vertical GRF show signifi-\ncant changes from third trimester to the postpartum period,\nemphasizing an increase of 4% in the braking peak and a\ndecrease of 5% of bodyweight (BW) in the inverted peak for\nright lower limb. In both stances, a significant decrease of 5%\nBW in the third peak from the first to the third trimesters\nand an increase of about 7% BW from the end of pregnancy\nto postpartum period were observed, which correspond to a\nrecovery to values above those recorded in early pregnancy.\nAlso in propulsive peak, to the right stance, there is a decrease\nof 4% BW from second to third trimesters. In the anterior-\nposterior component of GRF, an increase of 2% BW from\nfirst trimester to postpartum period in the posterior direction\n(first peak) of the right lower limb and a decrease of 2% BW\nin the anterior direction (second peak) of the left lower limb\nwere found which represent that at the end of pregnancy the\nparticipants apply less of their bodyweight of force against the\nfloor in the loading response phase and in the preswing phase.\nThe medial-lateral component of GRF decreases in the first\npeak, moving from a medial reaction to a lateral reaction in\nthe third trimester to the postpartum period.\n\n3.2. Joint Moments of Force\n\n3.2.1. Sagittal Plane. A longitudinal effect of pregnancy in\njoint moments of force, in sagittal plane, was observed for\nsome peaks of hip and ankle joints (Figure 2).\n\nDescriptive statistics of the joints moment, and the\nsignificance levels of the pairs of collections with significant\nchanges for sagittal, frontal, and transverse planes, are pre-\nsented in Table 2.\n\nThe moment of force in hip joint shows a significant\ndecrease of 0.128 N?m?kg?1 in the action of hip extensors,\nduring loading response phase from first to third trimesters\nin the right lower limb and an increase of, respectively,\n0.87 N?m?kg?1 and 0.154 N?m?kg?1 from first (left side) and\n\n\n\n4 Scientifica\n\n1st\n\n2nd\n\n2nd\n\n1st\n\n1st\n\n2nd\n\n2nd\n\nLR Mst Tst Psw LR Mst Tst Psw\n\nLR Mst Tst Psw LR Mst Tst Psw\n\nLR Mst Tst Psw LR Mst Tst Psw\n\nVertical\nRight lower limb\n\nVertical\nLeft lower limb\n\nAnterior (+) posterior (?)

In terminal stance\nphase, only for right side, there is a significant decrease of\n0.156 N?m?kg?1 in the action of the hip flexors from the begin-\nning to the end of pregnancy, and an increase of, respectively,\n0.208 N?m?kg?1 and 0.285 N?m?kg?1 from the second and\nthird trimesters to postpartum, similar to what happens at the\nbeginning of the stance phase. No changes were found in knee\nmoments of force during pregnancy and postpartum period.\nThe ankle plantarflexors participation shows a significant\ndecreasing of 0.082 N?m?kg?1 from first to third trimesters,\nin right ankle, and an increase of 0.075 N?m?kg?1 on their\nparticipation from late pregnancy to postpartum period, for\nleft ankle.\n\n3.2.2.

Transverse Plane. In transverse plane, the effect of\npregnancy is only observable in hip joint for midstance phase\n(Wilks\u2019?= 0.201,?(3,8) = 10.573,?= 0.004) (Figure 4).\n\nDuring this phase, there is an increase in the participation\nof the external rotators of the right hip throughout pregnancy,\nmost pronounced between the first and second trimesters\nand less pronounced between the first and third trimesters,\nwith increases in 0.204 N?m?kg?1 and 0.106 N?m?kg?1, respec-\ntively. From the second trimester to the postpartum period,\n\nthe share of external rotators of the hip decreased significantly\nto values close to those found in early pregnancy.\n\n3.3.

A longitudinal effect of pregnancy in\njoints power was observed for some peaks of hip and knee\njoints (Figure 5).\n\nTable 3 shows the descriptive statistics of the joints power,\nand the significance levels of the pairs of collections with\nsignificant changes for sagittal, frontal, and transverse planes.\nIn general, joints power in the postpartum period has similar\nvalues of early pregnancy, when compared to the values\nobserved during late pregnancy.\n\nThe second peak of hip joint power shows a significant\nincrease of 0.372 W?kg?1 and 0.257 W?kg?1, respectively, for\nright and left lower limbs, from third trimester to postpar-\ntum period, which indicates a lower execution of eccentric\ncontraction of hip flexors during terminal stance phase in\nlate pregnancy. The influence of pregnancy on knee joint\nwas verified in the second and third peaks; however, a\nsignificant increase of 0.145 W?kg?1 was found only in the\nsecond peak between first trimester and postpartum period,\nwhich means that during midstance phase, pregnant women\nin early pregnancy did a minor concentric contraction of the\nknee extensors. In the power of ankle joint there were no\nsignificant changes found between collection phases.\n\n3.3.2. Frontal Plane. The longitudinal effect of pregnancy was\nnot observed in the frontal plane, except for the first peak\npower of the left hip joint (Figure 6).\n\n\n\nScientifica 7\n\nTable 2: Mean and standard deviation of the joint moment peaks, and significance levels of the pairs of collections with significant changes\nfor sagittal, frontal, and transverse planes.\n\nJoint Plane Side Peak First trimester Second trimester Third trimester Postpartum ?\nMean Std. deviation Mean Std. deviation Mean Std. deviation Mean Std. deviation\n\nAnkle\n\nSagittal\nRight 1st 0.125 0.031 0.130 0.068 0.119 0.048 0.156 0.060\n\n2nd ?1.364 0.086 ?1.336 0.096 ?1.282 0.061 ?1.337 0.114 (b) 0.019\n\nLeft 1st 0.150 0.056 0.127 0.052 0.103 0.038 0.162 0.057\n2nd ?1.301 0.128 ?1.340 0.084 ?1.294 0.107 ?1.368 0.128 (f) 0.015\n\nFrontal Right 1st 0.349 0.170 0.459 0.153 0.376 0.162 0.364 0.191\nLeft 1st 0.311 0.176 0.309 0.177 0.382 0.195 0.377 0.231\n\nTransverse\nRight 1st 0.041 0.039 0.033 0.029 0.013 0.019 0.022 0.026\n\n2nd ?0.132 0.054 ?0.155 0.107 ?0.136 0.038 ?0.151 0.052\n\nLeft 1st 0.034 0.030 0.034 0.024 0.049 0.028 0.029 0.029\n2nd ?0.161 0.093 ?0.125 0.044 ?0.097 0.056 ?0.129 0.055\n\nKnee Sagittal\n\nRight\n1st 0.341 0.314 0.364 0.368 0.366 0.254 0.502 0.371\n2nd ?0.382 0.198 ?0.339 0.169 ?0.267 0.198 ?0.294 0.186\n3rd 0.171 0.091 0.209 0.138 0.173 0.111 0.249 0.166\n\nLeft\n1st 0.355 0.425 0.347 0.365 0.428 0.310 0.476 0.487\n2nd ?0.330 0.115 ?0.364 0.130 ?0.288 0.168 ?0.361 0.109\n3rd 0.219 0.087 0.169 0.121 0.186 0.099 0.185 0.101\n\nHip\n\nSagittal\n\nRight 1st ?0.612 0.172 ?0.527 0.147 ?0.484 0.167 ?0.618 0.202\n(b) 0.013\n(f) 0.022\n\n2nd 0.769 0.200 0.691 0.145 0.614 0.129 0.899 0.233\n(b) 0.031\n(e) 0.009\n(f) 0.001\n\nLeft 1st ?0.511 0.160 ?0.550 0.173 ?0.445 0.127 ?0.598 0.155\n(d) 0.034\n(f) 0.001\n\n2nd 0.789 0.141 0.687 0.209 0.653 0.074 0.798 0.254\n\nFrontal\nRight 1st ?0.870 0.197 ?0.943 0.291 ?0.856 0.097 ?0.828 0.143\n\n2nd ?0.735 0.146 ?0.755 0.217 ?0.759 0.133 ?0.688 0.160\n\nLeft 1st ?0.803 0.113 ?0.877 0.172 ?0.854 0.097 ?0.836 0.169\n2nd ?0.735 0.145 ?0.802 0.178 ?0.715 0.148 ?0.721 0.140\n\nTransverse Right 1st ?0.237 0.057 ?0.441 0.363 ?0.342 0.071 ?0.257 0.083\n(a) 0.006\n(b) 0.008\n(e) 0.013\n\nLeft 1st ?0.255 0.051 ?0.317 0.079 ?0.301 0.110 ?0.260 0.086\n(a) Significant differences between 1st and 2nd trimesters; (b) significant differences between 1st and 3rd trimesters; (c) significant differences between 2nd\nand 3rd trimesters; (d) significant differences between 1st trimester and PP; (e) significant differences between 2nd trimester and PP; (f) significant differences\nbetween 3rd trimester and PP; ns: nonsignificant.

A longitudinal effect of pregnancy in\njoints power of transverse plane was observed for some peaks\nof hip and ankle joints (Figure 7).\n\nIn right hip joint, an increase of 0.365 W?kg?1 in eccentric\ncontraction of the external rotators of the hip was observed\nbetween first and second trimesters of pregnancy, during\nloading response phase. The left ankle joint shows a signifi-\ncant decrease of around 0.06 W?kg?1 in the ankle abductors,\nfrom the first and second trimesters to late pregnancy, which\n\nrepresents a lower eccentric contraction of these muscles\nduring terminal stance phase.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThis study aimed to analyze the biomechanics of gait during\npregnancy and postpartum period in a longitudinal perspec-\ntive, in order to understand if there are any changes in the\nkinetic parameters of gait between collection phases. While\nother studies did not found any changes in the vertical or\nanterior components of GRF [4, 6, 7], in this study the quan-\ntification of vertical GRF has shown a decrease in the braking\npropulsive peaks from late pregnancy to postpartum period\n\n\n\n8 Scientifica\n\n1st\n2nd\n\n1st\n2nd\n\n1st\n\n1st\n\nLR Mst Tst Psw LR Mst Tst Psw\n\nLR Mst Tst Psw LR Mst Tst Psw\n\nRight lower limb Left lower limb\n\n3rd trimester\nPostpartum\n\n3rd trimester\nPostpartum\n\n1st trimester\n2nd trimester\n\n1st trimester\n2nd trimester\n\n?1.0\n\n?0.4\n\n0.2\n\n(N\n\u00b7m\n\u00b7k\n\ng?\n1\n)\n\n100.00.0 50.0\n?0.2\n\n0.4\n\n1.0\n\n(N\n\u00b7m\n\u00b7k\n\ng?\n1\n)\n\n100.00.0 50.0\n\n?0.10\n\n0.20\n\n0.50\n\n(N\n\u00b7m\n\u00b7k\n\ng?\n1\n)\n\n100.00.0 50.0\nStance phase (%)\n\n?0.50\n\n?0.20\n\n0.10\n\n(N\n\u00b7m\n\u00b7k\n\ng?\n1\n)\n\n100.00.0 50.0\nStance phase (%)\n\nHip adductors (+) abductors (?)

This result suggests that downward\nacceleration for the advancement of the body of the pregnant\nwomen and respective force production in the transmission\nof weight are smaller in late pregnancy [17]. In the medial-\nlateral component, it was found that in late pregnancy women\nhave more medial reaction for left lower limb, similarly to\nthe results also found by Takeda et al. [18] and our previous\nstudy [5] particularly during the loading response phase,\nwhich means that participants maintain the medial force\nduring most of the stance phase. Few studies have found\nsignificant changes in the medial reaction forces, but many\nauthors make reference to a greater instability in the frontal\nplane of the pregnant woman (e.g., [4, 5, 7]), for which these\nresults indicate the motor response to this instability, thereby\npromoting greater body stability. The fact that the changes\n\nonly happen in one of the lower limbs shows that the com-\npensations derived from imbalances can happen only in one\nof the limbs to maintain balance and reinforces the need to\nmake analyzes of the two sides.\n\nIn the sagittal plane, the kinetics of the hip joint has a\nsignificant reduction in the participation of the hip extensors\nduring the loading response phase, which is highly associated\nwith pregnancy. The participation of the hip extensors is\nrelated with the acceptance and support of the weight, which\nmay be adversely affected by the reduced contribution of\nthese muscles as the pregnancy progresses. At the terminal\nstance phase a reduction in the participation of the right\nhip flexors was established, also accompanied by a decrease\nin eccentric contraction of these muscles. In this phase, the\nextension of the thigh is promoted by inertia and gravity [19],\nand these results suggest less control in this motor action by\n\n\n\nScientifica 9\n\n1st\n\n1st\n\n2nd\n1st\n\n2nd\n\nLR Mst Tst Psw LR Mst Tst Psw\n\nLR Mst Tst Psw LR Mst Tst Psw\n\nRight lower limb Left lower limb\n\n?\n1st\n\n3rd trimester\nPostpartum\n\n3rd trimester\nPostpartum\n\n1st trimester\n2nd trimester\n\n1st trimester\n2nd trimester\n\n?0.15\n\n0.17\n\n0.50\n\n(N\n\u00b7m\n\u00b7k\n\ng?\n1\n)\n\n?0.50\n\n?0.17\n\n0.15\n\n(N\n\u00b7m\n\u00b7k\n\ng?\n1\n)\n\n100.00.0 50.0 100.00.0 50.0\n\n?0.10\n\n0.05\n\n0.20\n\n(N\n\u00b7m\n\u00b7k\n\ng?\n1\n)\n\n?0.20\n\n?0.05\n\n0.10\n\n(N\n\u00b7m\n\u00b7k\n\ng?\n1\n)\n\n100.00.0 50.0\nStance phase (%)\n\n100.00.0 50.0\nStance phase (%)\n\nHip internal rotators (+) external rotators (?)

In fact, the main objective of the hip joint\nmuscles during the stance phase is the stabilization of the\ntrunk [17], function that is affected, taking into account the\nmajority of the results found.\n\nIn our previous study [5] there was a significant decrease\nin knee joint moments between the group of pregnant women\nand the group of nonpregnant women, showing that changes\nin the knee joint moments happen until the end of the\nfirst trimester. This is not observed in the present study,\nwhere the participation of the knee joint flexor and extensor\nremain similar throughout pregnancy. However, the variation\nof mechanical energy in these muscle groups has been\ninfluenced by pregnancy, with a significant reduction in the\nproduction of mechanical energy of the right knee extensors\nduring midstance phase. The main function of the kinetics of\nthe knee during this phase is to stabilize lower limbs when\n\nthe total body weight is transferred for a single limb support,\nwhich in this case might be compromised. The kinetics of\nthe ankle is influenced by pregnancy in participation of the\nplantar flexors during the preswing phase, with a decrease\nthroughout pregnancy and a recovery of that participation in\npostpartum period. Two indications can be drawn from these\nresults: the first is that the acceleration of the limb forward\nwill be lower in late pregnancy and the second is that this\nparticipation is fully recovered after delivery.\n\nOther studies reported some changes in the joint\nmoments for the frontal plane, particularly an increase of the\nhip joint moments [10] (tested only between third trimester\nand postpartum) and the knee joint moments [9] and a\ndecrease of ankle joint moments [5]. In this study no changes\nwere found throughout pregnancy or postpartum.

One possible reason for the absence of any changes\nin the frontal plane may be revealed by the descriptive\nstatistics of these variables, which relates to the fact that they\npresent the highest variability (standard deviation) between\nthe analyses of the planes of motion.\n\nOnly our previous study [5] reports changes during\npregnancy in the transverse plane kinetics. In this study,\nduring the loading response phase, significant increases were\nfound in the participation of the right hip external rotators\n\nand eccentric contraction of these muscles, particularly in\nthe second half of the pregnancy. This action is responsible\nfor deceleration of the pelvis rotation, which aids in the\nadvancement of the contralateral thigh [17], indicating that\nduring pregnancy there is an increased control in advance of\nthe contralateral limb. During the terminal stance phase, a\ndecrease in eccentric contraction of the left ankle abductors\nalong the pregnancy was observed, which indicates less con-\ntrol in the position of the left foot during the first moments\nof heel rise. The hypothesis of this study, where pregnancy\nis associated with kinetic adaptations, is partially confirmed\n\n\n\n12 Scientifica\n\n1st\n\n2nd 3rd\n\n1st\n\n2nd 3rd\n\n1st\n\n2nd\n\n1st\n\n2nd\n\nLR Mst Tst Psw LR Mst Tst Psw\n\nLR Mst Tst Psw LR Mst Tst Psw\n\nRight lower limb Left lower limb\nPower production (+) Power production (+)\n\nA\nnk\n\nle\n (W\n\n\u00b7k\ng?\n\n1\n)\n\nA\nnk\n\nle\n (W\n\n\u00b7k\ng?\n\n1\n)\n\n?1.0\n\n0.0\n\nH\nip\n\n (W\n\u00b7k\n\ng?\n1\n)\n\n1.0\n\n?1.0\n\n0.0\n\nH\nip\n\n (W\n\u00b7k\n\ng?\n1\n)\n\n1.0\n\n3rd trimester\nPostpartum\n\n3rd trimester\nPostpartum\n\n1st trimester\n2nd trimester\n\n1st trimester\n2nd trimester\n\n?0.10\n\n0.20\n\n0.50\n\n?0.10\n\n0.20\n\n0.50\n100.00.0 50.0100.00.0 50.0\n\n100.00.0 50.0\nStance phase (%)\n\n100.00.0 50.0\nStance phase (%)\n\nFigure 6: Joints power in the frontal plane during gait (in W?kg?1).

This\nresult indicates that some situations of body instability might\nbe maintained in the postpartum, suggesting the importance\nof physical activity, in order to promote the full recovery of\nthe body stability. In the sagittal plane, for the vast majority of\nthe parameters with significant changes, a recovery to values\nsimilar to those found in early pregnancy was observed,\nconfirming the hypothesis raised.\n\nAccording to Forczek and Staszkiewicz [20], the pregnant\nwoman has two main strategies for adjustment of biomechan-\nical parameters: first to increase the body stability, and second\nto reduce the energy expenditure. Based on our results, the\nsecond approach seems to be adopted in respect to the kinetic\n\nparameters. However, most studies on kinematic parameters\nof pregnant women during walking point to findings related\nto the first strategy. This suggests that, on the one hand,\nthe woman increases her body stability in detriment of cost\nenergy (based on kinematics) and, on the other hand, reduces\nthe mechanical load in order to reduce the energy cost\n(based on kinetics). This reflection shows a balance between\nstrategies, which require further analysis. This is in line with\nsome theories of motor behavior that indicate that when the\nbody is faced with constraints of the organism (and possibly\nother constraints) it self-organizes in order to have greater\nefficiency [21, 22].\n\nWith regard to changes during pregnancy, the morpho-\nlogical and body composition parameters are those that\nare widely known. However, it is not known how these\nvariables influence the biomechanical parameters, or which\nof them give further explanation to mechanical changes in\n\n\n\nScientifica 13\n\n50.0\n\n2nd\n\n1st\n\n2nd\n\n1st\n\n2nd\n\n1st\n\nLR Mst Tst Psw LR Mst Tst Psw\n\nLR Mst Tst Psw LR Mst Tst Psw\n\nRight lower limb Left lower limb\n\n?\n2nd\n\n?\n1st\n\nA\nnk\n\nle\n (W\n\n\u00b7k\ng?\n\n1\n)\n\nA\nnk\n\nle\n (W\n\n\u00b7k\ng?\n\n1\n)\n\n?0.60\n\n?0.15\n\n0.30\n\nH\nip\n\n (W\n\u00b7k\n\ng?\n1\n)\n\n3rd trimester\nPostpartum\n\n3rd trimester\nPostpartum\n\n1st trimester\n2nd trimester\n\n1st trimester\n2nd trimester\n\nPower production (+) Power production (+)\n\n100.00.0 50.0\n?0.60\n\n?0.15\n\n0.30\n\nH\nip\n\n (W\n\u00b7k\n\ng?\n1\n)\n\n100.00.0 50.0\n\n?0.15\n\n?0.03\n\n0.10\n\n100.00.0\nStance phase (%)\n\n?0.15\n\n?0.03\n\n0.10\n\n100.00.0 50.0\nStance phase (%)\n\nFigure 7: Joints power in the transverse plane during gait (in W?kg?1).

Thus, we\nsuggest that future studies quantify the morphological and\nbody composition changes and analyze how these changes\ninfluence the biomechanical parameters of women through-\nout pregnancy and in the postpartum period.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nA descriptive longitudinal type design was performed, in\nwhich pregnant women were assessed in the first, second,\nand third trimesters of pregnancy and in the sixth month\nof the postpartum period. The biomechanical analysis of the\nlower limb during gait showed that pregnancy is a factor that\ninfluences the kinetic variables of the ankle, knee, and hip\njoints. The joint that undergoes the most evident changes is\nby far the hip. This fact may be justified by being closer to\nthe body region with greater anatomical and morphological\n\nchanges. The overall results point to biomechanical adjust-\nments that show a decrease of the mechanical load of women\nthroughout pregnancy, possibly in order to avoid strong\ninteraction between women and the ground, confirmed by\nthe decrease of GRF, the joint moments, and joint powers in\nthe sagittal plane, whose parameters are primarily responsible\nfor the progression of the body in space. These results point\nto some applications to this population, namely, the need\nto perform physical activities for the development of body\nstability, particularly the stability of the joints of the lower\nlimbs.\n\nDisclosure\n\nThe funders had no role in study design, data collection and\nanalysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the paper.\n\n\n\n14 Scientifica\n\nConflict of Interests\n\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interests\nregarding the publication of this paper.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors would like to thank to all participants of the study\nas well as Professor Filomena Carnide for statistical guidance.\nThe present publication was supported by the following\nprojects: (1) funder, Fundac?a?o para a Cie?ncia e Tecnologia\n(FCT)/Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology,\nproject title: Effect of Biomechanical Loading on the Mus-\nculoskeletal System in Women during Pregnancy and the\nPostpartum Period; promoter, CIPER/FMH-UL/ESDRM-\nIPS; Principal Researcher, Rita Santos-Rocha; and project\nreference, PTDC/DES/102058/2008; (2) funder, European\nUnion: QREN-InAlentejo-Programa Operacional do Alentejo-\n2007\u20132013/National Strategic Reference Framework, project\ntitle: Alentejo\u2019s Science and Technology Park, Sport and\nHealth Research Center; promoter: Polytechnic Institute of\nSantare?m, Sport Sciences School of Rio Maior/Health School\nof Santare?m; Project Coordinator, Rita Santos-Rocha; and\nproject reference, ALENT-07-0262-FEDER-001883.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Your\nPregnancy and Childbirth: Month to Month, American College\nof Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Washington, DC, USA,\n2010.\n\n[2] Institute of Medicine and National Research Council of the\nNational Academies, Weight Gain During Pregnancy: Reexam-\nining the Guidelines, The National Academies Press, Washing-\nton, DC, USA, 2009.\n\n[3] R.

It is not clear whether the biomechanical changes \n\noccurring in this period are due exclusively to body composition and body size, or due to other \n\nphysiological factors. The purpose of this study was to quantify the morphology and body \n\ncomposition of women throughout pregnancy and in the postpartum, and identify the \n\ncontribution of these parameters on the lower limb joints kinetic during gait. Eleven healthy \n\nwomen were assessed longitudinally, during pregnancy and in postpartum, regarding several \n\nanthropometric measurements to determine body composition and kinetic parameters of gait. \n\nMost of the variables associated with body composition and body dimensions showed a \n\nsignificant increase during pregnancy and a decrease in the postpartum. Maternal\u2019s body \n\ncomposition in the postpartum was similar to those found in the 1\nst\n trimester, except for \n\ntriceps skinfold, calf total area, and body mass index, with higher results than at the beginning \n\nof pregnancy. Some models were developed to predict women's internal loading through \n\nanthropometric variables. Four models include variables associated with the amount of fat, \n\nfour models that include variables related to overall body weight, three models that include \n\nfat-free mass, and one model that includes the shape of the trunk as a predictor variable. All \n\nmodels had an adjusted R squared between 29.6 and 66.9, indicating that changes in \n\nmaternal\u2019s body composition and morphology, largely determine kinetic dynamics of the \n\nfemale joints in this particular stage of life. \n\n  \n\nPage 2 of 27\n\nhttps://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/bjsm\n\nBritish Journal of Sports Medicine\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\n\n\nC\nonfidential: For R\n\neview\n O\n\nnly\nINTRODUCTION \n\nDuring pregnancy and in the postpartum period, the woman\u2019s body experiences large \n\nchanges in morphology, physiology and consequently, in body composition. The association \n\nbetween body composition, particularly the increase of maternal weight and health related \n\nproblems are known for mother and child well-being.[1 ,2] According to Institute of Medicine \n\nand National Research Council of the National Academies [3] women with a body mass index \n\n(BMI) lower than 19.8kg/m\n2\n (underweight) should increase their weight between 12.5kg and \n\n18kg; women with BMI between 19.8kg/m\n2\n and 26.0kg/m\n\n2\n (normal weight) must have an \n\nincrease in body weight between 11.5kg and 16kg; women with BMI between 26kg/m\n2\n and \n\n29.0kg/m\n2\n (overweight) must have an increase in weight of 7kg to 11.5kg; women with BMI \n\nequal or greater than 29kg/m\n2\n (obese) should gain at least 6.8kg. For women carrying twins, \n\nthe recommended target total weight gain at term is 16.0 to 20.5kg.[3 ,4] \n\nWeight gain during pregnancy has been widely studied and is reported in several \n\nstudies as described below. In general, during pregnancy the weight gain stands at around \n\n11kg[5-7] although it has been increasing in recent years from 9kg[8] to 14.5kg[9] in non-obese \n\nwomen, with much of these gains occurring during the 2\nnd\n\n trimester. However, in late \n\npregnancy, women accumulate an average of 4kg of body fat[5 ,7 ,8]. The prevalence of \n\nwomen with normal weight significantly decreased between the 2\nnd\n\n and the 3\nrd\n\n trimesters \n\nfrom 63.2% to 39.5%, respectively.[10] After delivery, the woman's weight remains above her \n\npre-pregnancy body weight[5] or in early pregnancy.[6] \n\nWomen classified as obese in early pregnancy have significantly higher sum of \n\nskinfolds thickness and higher fat mass gains compared to normal weight women.[6] Although \n\ndifferent studies showed an increase of the skinfolds thickness throughout pregnancy, changes \n\nwere not always significant. Thus, the skinfolds that showed significant increases were: \n\nsubscapular, suprailiac and thigh;[11] triceps, biceps and subscapular;[12] and mid-thigh and \n\ncalf skinfolds.[10] \n\nPage 3 of 27\n\nhttps://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/bjsm\n\nBritish Journal of Sports Medicine\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\n\n\nC\nonfidential: For R\n\neview\n O\n\nnly\nBody dimensions of pregnant women measured by the segmental girths show that \n\nthigh,[10 ,11] hip and calf girths[11] significantly increase during pregnancy. Also between the \n\n2\nnd\n\n and the 3\nrd\n\n trimesters there are an increase of body fat areas of the mid-thigh and calf and \n\nof the total fat mass.[10] \n\nThe influence of body segment parameters in the estimation of inverse dynamics \n\nsolutions have been investigated by some studies conducted in the last decade. [13-15] \n\nHowever, it is not known the influence of body composition and morphologic changes on \n\nwoman\u2019s biomechanical parameters of gait during pregnancy and in postpartum period.  \n\nThus, the purpose of this study was to quantify maternal anthropometric and body \n\ncomposition changes throughout pregnancy and in the postpartum period, and to identify the \n\ncontribution of these parameters on the lower limb joints kinetic during gait. \n\n \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n\nSubjects \n\nThe sample was composed of 11 healthy Caucasian women (33.2\u00b11.6years, range 32-\n\n37) without musculoskeletal problems, neuromuscular disorders or other diseases. \n\nParticipants\u2019 characteristics are described in Table 1. \n\nTable 1.

All anthropometric data were \n\nmeasured according to the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry \n\n(ISAK) standardized measurement protocol,[16] with exception for abdominal girth, which was \n\nmeasured 2cm below belly button (navel), and the thoracic breadth, which was measured at \n\nthe level of the last rib. Data were collected by ISAK certified anthropometrists. Based on these \n\nmeasurements, other variables were calculated, including body weight gain in each trimester \n\nby reference to pre-pregnancy body weight (self-reported by pregnant in a specific \n\nquestionnaire form); the body density and the percentage of fat mass,[17] muscle and fat \n\nareas of the thigh and lower leg;[18] the body fat and fat-free mass; the biiliocristale-acromiale \n\nand abdominal-gluteal ratio and BMI. \n\nKinematic and kinetic parameters were collected through 12 infrared high-speed \n\ncameras (Oqus-300, Qualisys, Sweden) at a rate of 200Hz, and 3 force platforms (2 Kistlers - \n\nKistler AG, Winterthur, Switzerland; and 1 AMTI force plate - Advanced Mechanical \n\nTechnology, Inc., Watertown), at a rate of 1000Hz. Spherical reflective markers were placed on \n\nthe skin in lower limb segments with double-sided adhesive tape at predefined locations \n\naccording to recent recommendations.[19] Kinetic and kinematic data were synchronized to \n\nthe same file through software Qualisys Track Manager (QTM; Qualisys AB, Gothenburg, \n\nSweden).

Nevertheless, most of these variables did not differ between the 1\nst\n\n \n\ntrimester and postpartum, with exception for body weight loss, which is significantly lower \n\nafter delivery than in the 1\nst\n\n trimester (p=0.012).  \n\nPage 13 of 27\n\nhttps://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/bjsm\n\nBritish Journal of Sports Medicine\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\n\n\nC\nonfidential: For R\n\neview\n O\n\nnly\nDuring pregnancy several physiological modifications occur in the pregnant woman\u2019s \n\nbody in order to guarantee mother\u2019s energy needs and health and to support fetus growth and \n\ndevelopment.[25 ,27 ,28] In fact, maternal body composition has been one of the most \n\nstudied, but there is a lack of it in relation to kinetics parameters of gait during pregnancy. \n\nIn our study, both weight gain and the body mass index were affected by pregnancy \n\nwith significant increases during pregnancy[26] and significant decreases to postpartum \n\nperiod, as in recent studies.[29] However, that variation in weight gain was lower than the \n\nrecommendations during the first two trimesters and higher in the 3\nrd\n\n trimester.[3 ,26 ,28] It \n\nhas been highlighted that maternal fat gains are associated with important implications for \n\nmaternal and offspring health and with a greater postpartum fat retention in the mother.[26] \n\nIn addition, the maternal body weight gain may also interfere with important kinetics \n\nparameters of gait, as observed in our results of gait\u2019s kinetics parameters. \n\nIn another recent study[25] to determine women\u2019s metabolic profile, 21 healthy \n\nwomen were evaluated: 11 at preconception, during pregnancy and 1 year postpartum, and 10 \n\nhad no interval pregnancy, so were assessed at baseline and a 1 year interval. Weight, fat-free \n\nmass (kg), fat mass (kg) and the percentage of body fat were assessed by hydrodensitometry. \n\nSignificant differences (p<0.05) were observed for weight and fat-free mass from \n\npreconception [59.7 (53.5\u201385.6)kg and 42.5 (39.0\u201349.2)kg, respectively] to pregnancy [77.2 \n\n(62.9\u201394.3)kg and 54.7 (46.7\u201357.5)kg, respectively]. In contrast, no significant differences were \n\nobserved in preconception versus postpartum for these two variables, as well as no significant \n\ndifferences (P>0.05) were observed in body fat according to body size and in the percentage of \n\nbody fat between preconception [20.7 (13.7\u201337.4)kg and 30.0 (24.1\u201343.8)%] and pregnancy \n\n[24.2 (14.9\u201338.7)kg and 30.6 (24.8\u201340.2)%] and between pregnancy and postpartum [18.4 \n\n(13.8\u201341.3)kg and 29.3(25.2\u201346.2)%]. Similar results with ours in the postpartum period were \n\nobserved for fat-free mass [44.3 (38.8\u201349.6)kg], body fat according to body size [18.4 (13.8\u2013\n\n41.3)kg] and the percentage of body fat [29.3 (25.2\u201346.2)%]. \n\nPage 14 of 27\n\nhttps://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/bjsm\n\nBritish Journal of Sports Medicine\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\n\n\nC\nonfidential: For R\n\neview\n O\n\nnly\nThe biiliocristale breadth has a significant increase of 1.5cm between the 1\n\nst\n and the 3\n\nrd\n \n\ntrimester and, although there is a reduction in late pregnancy to the postpartum period, this is \n\nnot significant, which may suggest that the distance between the iliac bones remains after \n\npregnancy. \n\nAs expected, abdominal and the gluteal girths suffered major changes throughout \n\npregnancy; however these variables recovered in the postpartum to values similar to those \n\nfound in early pregnancy. The calf girth increased 1.1cm from the 1\nst\n to the 3\n\nrd\n trimester as \n\nPerez, et al. [10] found. These authors also found changes in the mid-thigh girth, which was \n\nnot demonstrated in this study. \n\nAlthough the sum of skinfolds showed a significant increase between the 1\nst\n\n and 3\nrd\n\n \n\ntrimester of pregnancy, mainly caused by subscapular, triceps and biceps skinfolds, only the \n\ntriceps skinfold presented a significant increase of almost 4mm throughout pregnancy to the \n\npostpartum period. In spite of no significant changes were observed in the fat mass \n\npercentage, the accumulation of fat mass seems to happen mostly at the upper region of the \n\ntrunk and upper limbs, keeping or increasing their thickness in the postpartum period. In \n\naddition, relatively to fat mass weight, significantly increases from the 1\nst\n\n to the 2\nnd\n\n trimester \n\nand from the 2\nnd\n\n to the 3\nrd\n\n trimester of pregnancy were showed. After delivery, the fat mass \n\nweight decreases, showing a recovery to levels similar to the first stage of pregnancy. In the \n\nsame way, the free-fat mass weight increases during pregnancy, which may be related to the \n\nincrease of the tissues and fluids associated with pregnancy itself and also for the weight of \n\nthe fetus, and decrease again in the postpartum period. \n\nThe bi-compartmental assessment of body composition of the lower limbs can be \n\nobserved by the total, muscle and fat areas of the thigh and calf. Perez, et al. [10] have found \n\nincreases in the thigh fat area and further in calf fat area, between the 2\nnd\n\n and the 3\nrd\n\n \n\ntrimester. In this study, only the total area of the thigh showed significant changes, increasing \n\n14.5cm\n2 \n\nand 16.4cm\n2\n respectively from the 1\n\nst\n to the 2\n\nnd\n and from the 2\n\nnd\n to the 3\n\nrd\n trimesters \n\nPage 15 of 27\n\nhttps://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/bjsm\n\nBritish Journal of Sports Medicine\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\n\n\nC\nonfidential: For R\n\neview\n O\n\nnly\nof pregnancy. In the calf segment, significant increases were found throughout pregnancy, \n\nboth for fat and muscle areas, but only the last variable decreases in postpartum period. \n\nThe abdominal-gluteal ratio, shows the volume distribution between the lower torso \n\nand the pelvic region. Throughout pregnancy it changes so that in late pregnancy the \n\ndistribution of the volume of the abdomen (mainly anterior) and the volume of the hips \n\n(mainly posterior) is the same. The biiliocristale-biacromiale ratio do not shows significant \n\nchanges, meaning that during pregnancy the woman keep a rectangular trunk shape.[23] \n\nIn the 3\nrd\n\n trimester, the regression models to predict relative GRF of women shows \n\nthat higher ratio between iliocristal and acromial breadth have an increased magnitude in the \n\n3\nrd\n\n peak of vertical GRF (Figure 3). \n\nAfter application of the linear regression technique for predicting women's internal \n\nloading during pregnancy and in the postpartum period through anthropometric variables, \n\ntwelve models were developed, of which four models include independent variables \n\nassociated with the amount of fat; four models include independent variables related to \n\noverall body weight; three models include fat-free mass as a predictor variable and; a model \n\nincludes the shape of the trunk as a predictor variable. A summary of the interaction between \n\nthe anthropometric variables and the joint kinetic variables of the lower limb, in the four \n\nstudied stages, are represented in Figures 1 and 2. \n\nIn the 1\nst\n\n trimester of pregnancy, a higher body weight gain lead to an increased \n\nproduction of mechanical energy of the knee extensors during the mid-stance phase. In the 2\nnd\n\n \n\ntrimester the regression models allow to predict that a greater abdominal-gluteal ratio and a \n\nhigher percentage of body fat have respectively an increased participation of the extensors \n\nand external rotators of the hip, during the loading response phase. Also in this stage of \n\npregnancy, a larger thigh fat area lead to less absorption of mechanical energy of the hip \n\nflexors during terminal stance phase. In the 3\nrd\n\n trimester, a higher body mass index and larger \n\nareas of fat of the calf and the thigh increased the participation of the hip external rotators \n\nPage 16 of 27\n\nhttps://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/bjsm\n\nBritish Journal of Sports Medicine\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\n\n\nC\nonfidential: For R\n\neview\n O\n\nnly\nduring the loading response phase. In addition, a higher body weight gain, until this trimester, \n\ninduce to a greater eccentric contraction of the hip external rotators also in this phase of \n\nwalking cycle. A higher free-fat mass weight lead to a lower eccentric contraction of the hip \n\nflexors during the terminal stance, and a lower participation of the hip flexors during pre-swing \n\nphase. A higher weight of free-fat mass and a greater loss of body mass, in the postpartum \n\nperiod, leads respectively to a lower absorption of mechanical energy of the hip flexors during \n\nterminal stance phase, and to a lower participation of the same muscles during the pre-swing \n\nphase. \n\nConsidering the limitations on the use of simple linear regression techniques, it should \n\nbe appreciated that the variability in the explanation of the models have relatively high levels \n\nin five of them, whose values are very close to or above 50%. The highest levels of explanation \n\nin the models variability occurred in the 1\nst\n trimester and in the postpartum period, during the \n\nphases of gait cycle, in which there is an increased support of the body in one lower limb. The \n\nreason to happen in the early period of pregnancy and in the postpartum may show that the \n\nneuromuscular system of the woman is not prepared for morphological changes happening on \n\nher body. This information is relevant not only for the pregnant women, but also for Health \n\nand Physical Exercise Professionals.[28] \n\n \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n\nThe study of the influence of morphology on the internal load of women during \n\npregnancy and in the postpartum has not been studied. This study showed significant changes \n\nduring pregnancy, regarding the variables associated with global body composition. The \n\nabsolute amount of fat increased significantly to the end of pregnancy, especially by the \n\ncontribution of the adipose tissue accumulated in the skinfolds of the upper limbs and upper \n\ntrunk. Regarding to the relative values of fat, there were no changes during pregnancy and to \n\nthe postpartum period. \n\nPage 17 of 27\n\nhttps://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/bjsm\n\nBritish Journal of Sports Medicine\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\n\n\nC\nonfidential: For R\n\neview\n O\n\nnly\nThe shape of the trunk in a frontal perspective, the free-fat mass and the weight \n\ngain/loss appeared as major predictors of the joint kinetics of women throughout pregnancy \n\nand in the postpartum. Most of the variables related to the amount of fat are predictors of the \n\nmuscles involved in motor actions of the transverse plane. Most of the developed models were \n\nused to predict muscle participation involving the hip joint in the sagittal and transverse planes \n\nof motion, emphasizing that this joint is the one that is under greater influence of \n\nanthropometric variables. \n\nThe body weight gain/loss was the variable that most explained the mechanical energy \n\nof the lower limb joints, showing that had the most important role in the muscle contractions\u2019 \n\ndynamics, especially in the 1\nst\n and 3\n\nrd\n trimesters of pregnancy. \n\nThe morphological changes that occur during pregnancy had greater influence in \n\ninternal load involving the hip. \n\nAlthough, due to the sample size, regression models had only one predictor variable; \n\nthe explanation indices of the models (adjusted r squared) were quite high, indicating that \n\nbody composition and pregnant morphology changes during pregnancy, largely determining \n\nthe kinetic dynamics of the female joints in this particular stage of life.  \n\nMonitoring maternal\u2019s body composition during pregnancy and kinetic parameters of \n\ngait is difficulty, but of great importance, especially in the 3\nrd\n\n trimester. \n\nIt is recommended for further studies the increase of the sample to allow regression \n\nmodels with more variables, not only including the body composition parameters, but also \n\nphysical activity before and during pregnancy. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPage 18 of 27\n\nhttps://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/bjsm\n\nBritish Journal of Sports Medicine\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\n\n\nC\nonfidential: For R\n\neview\n O\n\nnly\n \n\n  \n\nPage 19 of 27\n\nhttps://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/bjsm\n\nBritish Journal of Sports Medicine\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\n\n\nC\nonfidential: For R\n\neview\n O\n\nnly\nCOMPETING OF INTERESTS \n\nThe authors declares that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of \n\nthis manuscript. \n\nFUNDING \n\nThe present publication was supported by the following projects:  \n\n(1) Funder: FCT \u2013 Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia / Portuguese Foundation for Science \nand Technology.
