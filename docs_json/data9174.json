Recently, a third mechanism \n\nof energy coupling named flavin-based electron bifurcation (FBEB) was proposed for \n\nanaerobic bacteria. Sulfate-reducing organisms (SRO) are a polyphyletic group of anaerobic \n\nmicroorganisms, which perform dissimilatory sulfate reduction. Interestingly, studies \n\nconcerning SRO identified protein homologies to enzymes engaged in FBEB in \n\nmethanogens, suggesting the presence of FBEB in sulfate reducers. Here we studied: i) the \n\nphysiological role of a protein complex (HdrABC-FloxABCD) possibly involved in FBEB; and \n\nii) the function of DsrD, a protein potentially involved in sulfite reduction, the last step of the \n\ndissimilatory sulfate reduction. \n\n Firstly, phenotypic characterization of hdrC and floxA mutants in Desulfovibrio \n\nvulgaris Hildenborough with ethanol as electron donor revealed no cell growth, while a \n\ncomplemented strain of the floxA mutant grew similarly to the wild-type (WT). Then, under \n\npyruvate fermentation conditions, both mutants produced low levels of ethanol comparing to \n\nthe WT and complemented strain. Gene and protein expression analysis in WT strains \n\ncultured with different electron donors/acceptors showed upregulation of FloxA and HdrA \n\nwhen ethanol is the electron donor. Moreover, an alcohol dehydrogenase (adh1) gene \n\npresent upstream of the hdr-flox cluster is also upregulated in the medium containing ethanol. \n\nAltogether, these results show that the HdrABC-FloxABCD complex is involved in the ethanol \n\nmetabolism of D. vulgaris. \n\n Secondly, the dsrD gene from D. vulgaris was cloned, overexpressed and the protein \n\npurified. Sulfite reduction activity and protein-protein interaction studies showed no direct \n\nbiochemical role of DsrD in sulfite reduction. Then a dsrD deletion mutant was generated \n\nshowing a long lag phase under sulfate reduction conditions when compared to the WT. This \n\nmutant did not grow with sulfite as electron acceptor, revealing the importance of dsrD in \n\nsulfite reduction, most likely at a regulatory level. \n\n Overall, this work allowed a better understanding of energy conservation \n\nmechanisms in SRO, proposing a new mechanism for ethanol metabolism played by the \n\nFloxABCD-HdrABC complex and producing new insights into the function of DsrD in the \n\ndissimilatory sulfate reduction. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords: Bioenergetics; energy conservation; flavin-based electron bifurcation; \n\nsulfate-reducing organisms; gene expression studies, phenotype characterization; \n\nprotein purification. \n\n\n\n vi \n\nResumo \n\n \n\n Os sistemas bioenerg\u00e9ticos de bact\u00e9rias quimiotr\u00f3ficas baseiam-se em dois \n\nmecanismos de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o de energia: a fosforila\u00e7\u00e3o ao n\u00edvel do substrato (FNS) e a \n\nfosforila\u00e7\u00e3o oxidativa (FO). A FO \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m conhecida como respira\u00e7\u00e3o e envolve \n\nacoplamento quimiosm\u00f3tico. Recentemente, um outro mecanismo de acoplamento \n\nenerg\u00e9tico, chamado bifurca\u00e7\u00e3o electr\u00f3nica baseada em flavinas (BEBF), foi proposto para \n\nbact\u00e9rias anaer\u00f3bias quimiotr\u00f3ficas. Este mecanismo \u00e9 caracterizado por acoplar uma \n\nreac\u00e7\u00e3o termodinamicamente n\u00e3o favor\u00e1vel a uma reac\u00e7\u00e3o favor\u00e1vel e foi j\u00e1 \n\nexperimentalmente demonstrado em organismos fermentativos, \u00e1rqueas metanog\u00e9nicas e \n\nbact\u00e9rias acetog\u00e9nicas. Os complexos proteicos envolvidos na BEBF s\u00e3o citoplasm\u00e1ticos, \n\ncont\u00eam flavinas como cofactores (FMN ou FAD) e um dos aceitadores/dadores de electr\u00f5es \n\n\u00e9 normalmente uma ferredoxina (Fd). \n\n Os organismos redutores de sulfato (ORS) s\u00e3o um grupo polifil\u00e9tico de \n\nmicrorganismos existentes em ambientes anaer\u00f3bios, tendo um metabolismo vers\u00e1til. Os \n\nsulfato-redutores t\u00eam a capacidade de realizar a redu\u00e7\u00e3o dissimilativa do sulfato, i.e., de \n\nreduzir grandes quantidades de sulfato como mecanismo de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o de energia \n\nproduzindo sulfureto, um produto t\u00f3xico do seu metabolismo. Deste modo estes organismos \n\ncontribuem para o ciclo biogeoqu\u00edmico do enxofre usando o sulfato como aceitador de \n\nelectr\u00f5es durante a degrada\u00e7\u00e3o de mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica, produzindo sulfureto que pode ser \n\noxidado por outros microrganismos. Pela capacidade que t\u00eam de utilizar diversos dadores e \n\naceitadores de electr\u00f5es, os ORS s\u00e3o usados em bio-remedia\u00e7\u00e3o de metais t\u00f3xicos e \n\ncompostos org\u00e2nicos como hidrocarbonetos; todavia estes organismos comportam \n\nigualmente um impacto negativo, nomeadamente contribuindo para a bio-corros\u00e3o de metais \n\nferrosos e de bet\u00e3o e contribuindo ainda para a acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o de reservas de petr\u00f3leo. Apesar \n\nda import\u00e2ncia ambiental destes microrganismos, os mecanismos de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nenergia neste grupo permanecem por conhecer com clareza. Para estudos fisiol\u00f3gicos, \n\ngen\u00e9ticos e bioqu\u00edmicos \u00e9 normalmente utilizado o organismo modelo Desulfovibrio vulgaris \n\nHildenborough, uma vez que \u00e9 relativamente f\u00e1cil e r\u00e1pido de cultivar em laborat\u00f3rio, tendo \n\nsido o primeiro ORS a ter o seu genoma sequenciado. Estudos gen\u00f3micos identificaram \n\nprote\u00ednas semelhantes \u00e0 heterodilsulfureto redutases (Hdr) em ORS, especialmente \n\nprote\u00ednas hom\u00f3logas \u00e0 HdrA, a subunidade proteica que cont\u00e9m uma flavina como co-factor \n\ne que foi proposta ser respons\u00e1vel pela BEBF em \u00e1rqueas metanog\u00e9nicas. Este estudo \n\nsugere desta forma que o mecanismo de BEBF pode estar presente em procariotas sulfato-\n\nredutores. \n\n Assim sendo, o objectivo deste trabalho centra-se em contribuir para um maior e \n\nmais profundo conhecimento dos mecanismos de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o de energia em sulfato-\n\nredutores, estudando o papel fisiol\u00f3gico do complexo citoplasm\u00e1tico heterodisulfureto \n\nredutase-oxidase de flavina (HdrABC-FloxABCD), que se pensa estar envolvido em BEBF, e \n\ninvestigando a potencial fun\u00e7\u00e3o da prote\u00edna redutase dissimilativa de sulfito (DsrD) na via da \n\nredu\u00e7\u00e3o dissimilativa do sulfato. \n\n\n\n vii \n\n Na primeira parte do trabalho experimental, estudou-se o papel fisiol\u00f3gico dos genes \n\nflox-hdr em D. vulgaris Hildenborough, usando duas estirpes mutantes: IPFG01, com uma \n\ncassete de resist\u00eancia a canamicina inserida no gene hdrC, e IPFG02, uma estirpe em que o \n\ngene floxA foi substitu\u00eddo por uma cassete de resist\u00eancia a canamicina por recombina\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nhom\u00f3loga. A caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o fenot\u00edpica das estirpes mutantes revelou que ambos os \n\nmutantes s\u00e3o incapazes de crescer quando o etanol \u00e9 usado como dador de electr\u00f5es para \n\nreduzir sulfato. Por outro lado uma estirpe mutante complementada com o gene floxA \n\n(IPFG03) cresceu de forma semelhante ao WT. Durante o crescimento fermentativo em \n\npiruvato, realizou-se a quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de etanol no meio extracelular atrav\u00e9s \n\nde um m\u00e9todo enzim\u00e1tico. Este ensaio experimental revelou uma produ\u00e7\u00e3o muito baixa de \n\netanol por parte das estirpes mutantes IPFG01 e IPFG02, comparativamente \u00e0s estirpes WT \n\ne IPFG03, indicando deste modo que em condi\u00e7\u00f5es fermentativas de crescimento, as \n\nprote\u00ednas FloxABCD est\u00e3o envolvidas na redu\u00e7\u00e3o de NAD\n+\n para produ\u00e7\u00e3o de etanol. Foram \n\nadicionalmente realizados estudos de express\u00e3o g\u00e9nica ao n\u00edvel do gene (por PCR \n\nquantitativo) e da prote\u00edna (por \u201cWestern blotting\u201d) na estirpe selvagem (WT) em condi\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nde cultura contendo diferentes dadores e aceitadores de electr\u00f5es. Estes revelaram que os \n\ngenes floxA e hdrA s\u00e3o sobre-expressos quando \u00e9 usado etanol como dador de electr\u00f5es, e \n\no mesmo foi observado ao n\u00edvel da express\u00e3o proteica. A montante dos genes hdr-flox est\u00e1 \n\nsituado um gene que codifica para uma \u00e1lcool desidrogenase (adh1) revelando igualmente \n\numa sobre-express\u00e3o quando o etanol \u00e9 usado como dador de electr\u00f5es. Contudo a \n\nexpress\u00e3o do gene adh1 \u00e9 consideravelmente superior \u00e0 dos genes anteriormente referidos, \n\nindicando que os genes adh1 e hdr-flox n\u00e3o se encontram no mesmo oper\u00e3o. Esta diferen\u00e7a \n\nobservada ao n\u00edvel da express\u00e3o g\u00e9nica reflectiu-se na purifica\u00e7\u00e3o das prote\u00ednas: enquanto \n\nque a prote\u00edna Adh1 foi facilmente purificada, o mesmo sucesso n\u00e3o foi obtido na purifica\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndas prote\u00ednas Flox e Hdr devido \u00e0 sua baixa express\u00e3o. Os resultados obtidos considerando \n\nesta parte do trabalho demonstram que as prote\u00ednas FloxABCD est\u00e3o envolvidas no \n\nmetabolismo do etanol em D. vulgaris. Propomos ent\u00e3o que o complexo FloxABC-HdrABCD \n\nseja capaz de realizar BEBF acoplando a redu\u00e7\u00e3o de Fd com NADH \u00e0 redu\u00e7\u00e3o da prote\u00edna \n\nDsrC igualmente com NADH. \n\n Na segunda parte deste trabalho, o gene dsrD foi clonado, sobre-expresso em \n\nEscherichia coli e a prote\u00edna subsequentemente purificada por t\u00e9cnicas cromatogr\u00e1ficas. O \n\ngene dsrD encontra-se situado imediatamente a jusante do gene dsrAB, fazendo ambos \n\nparte do mesmo oper\u00e3o. A redutase dissimilativa de sulfito (DsrAB) \u00e9, juntamente com a \n\nprote\u00edna DsrC, respons\u00e1vel pelo \u00faltimo passo da redu\u00e7\u00e3o dissimilativa do sulfato. Tendo em \n\nconta a potencial import\u00e2ncia da prote\u00edna DsrD na redu\u00e7\u00e3o do sulfato, foram realizadas \n\nensaios espectrofotom\u00e9tricos de actividade enzim\u00e1tica de redu\u00e7\u00e3o do sulfito e testes de \n\nintera\u00e7\u00e3o prote\u00edna-prote\u00edna (por Biacore) e prote\u00edna-ligando (por Calorimetria de Titula\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nIsot\u00e9rmica) de modo a detectar intera\u00e7\u00f5es entre a DsrD e DsrAB, DsrC e/ou sulfito. Apesar \n\ndas diversas tentativas, n\u00e3o foram obtidos resultados positivos, levando-nos a crer que a \n\nprote\u00edna DsrD desempenha um papel regulat\u00f3rio em vez de um papel funcional directo na \n\nredu\u00e7\u00e3o do sulfato. Um vez que a estrutura tridimensional da prote\u00edna foi j\u00e1 obtida e inclui um \n\n\n\n viii \n\ndom\u00ednio de liga\u00e7\u00e3o ao DNA, considera-se que a prote\u00edna DsrD desempenhe um papel \n\nregulat\u00f3rio in vivo. Durante este trabalho experimental foi constru\u00eddo um mutante de dele\u00e7\u00e3o \n\npor troca da sequ\u00eancia codificante para o gene dsrD com uma cassete de resist\u00eancia a \n\ncanamicina atrav\u00e9s de recombina\u00e7\u00e3o hom\u00f3loga. Os estudos fenot\u00edpicos com esta nova \n\nestirpe revelaram uma longa fase de adapta\u00e7\u00e3o na curva de crescimento em meio de cultura \n\ncontendo sulfato como aceitador de electr\u00f5es, comparativamente com a estirpe WT. \n\nPensamos que ap\u00f3s a longa fase de adapta\u00e7\u00e3o as c\u00e9lulas adquirem espontaneamente \n\nmuta\u00e7\u00f5es que lhes permitem adaptar-se ao meio contendo sulfato, demonstrando que o \n\ngene dsrD pode estar a regular os genes dsrAB afectando deste modo a via respirat\u00f3ria. \n\nAdicionalmente, a estirpe mutante n\u00e3o foi capaz de crescer em meio com sulfito como \n\naceitador de electr\u00f5es, o que revela que este gene \u00e9 essencial para a redu\u00e7\u00e3o do sulfito. \n\n De uma forma geral, este trabalho contribuiu para uma melhor e mais profunda \n\ncompreens\u00e3o do modo como os organismos sulfato-redutores desempenham a conserva\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde energia, com especial interesse na nova via de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o de energia, BEBF, que \n\naparenta estar disseminada pelas bact\u00e9rias quimiotr\u00f3ficas anaer\u00f3bias. Em perspectivas \n\nfuturas seria ideal conseguir expressar e purificar o complexo FloxABCD-HdrABC de modo a \n\nanalisar a BEBF in vitro. Adicionalmente, novas indica\u00e7\u00f5es foram obtidas no que toca a \n\ncompreender qual a fun\u00e7\u00e3o ao n\u00edvel fisiol\u00f3gico da prote\u00edna DsrD, envolvida na redu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndissimilativa do sulfato.

One of the features that distinguish living beings from inanimate \n\nobjects is their metabolism. Metabolism balances energy through a set of chemical \n\ntransformations occurring in two forms: anabolism, biosynthetic reactions requiring energy \n\ninput; and catabolism, molecular breakdown reactions that allow to restore the cellular energy \n\nbudget. The universal molecular currency of energy adopted by living beings is proton motive \n\nforce, which is consumed for cellular processes and produced by energy conservation \n\nmechanisms. Additionally, there are two environmental sources for energy conservation: in \n\nchemotrophic organisms, energy derives from the oxidation of environmental electron donors, \n\nwhile in phototrophic organisms energy comes from sunlight (Figure 1.1). Chemotrophic \n\norganisms exist virtually since the dawn of life on Earth and have evolved to very distinct \n\nmetabolic systems ever since. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 \u2013 Energy transformations via the proton motive force system.

The prebiotic atmosphere was mainly composed of hydrogen, ammonia, \n\nmethane, carbon dioxide, and water (2). In the 1920\u2019s Aleksandr Oparin and John Haldane \n\nhypothesized that these compounds, combined with the strong UV radiation present at that \n\ntime, led to the emergence of the first biomolecules in ocean waters. The combination of \n\nthese molecules, along with the action of Natural Selection during millions and millions of \n\nyears, formed the complex life forms we know of today. \n\n Since the primordial atmosphere had no oxygen, the first living beings had to \n\nreplicate and generate their own energy from an anaerobic environment. Energy was stored \n\nin the form of ATP, an energy-rich compound required for anabolic reactions and cell function; \n\nthis biochemical signature has been conserved by nature thereafter and is still present among \n\nall living forms. In this regard, the first metabolism capable of sustaining life would use the \n\ncompounds available in the primitive environment in order to generate energy for cellular \n\nbiochemical reactions.  \n\n During the evolution of life, new metabolic machineries started to emerge. Despite \n\nthe diversity of mechanisms, energy conservation in chemotrophs is thought to exist only via \n\ntwo different ways: substrate-level phosphorylation (SLP) and electron-transfer \n\nphosphorylation (ETP), also known as oxidative phosphorylation (1). In the first mechanism, \n\nenergy-rich compounds form ATP by transferring a phosphoryl group to ADP in anaerobic \n\nconditions. The second mechanism (ETP) involves the formation of an electrochemical \n\ngradient (?pH for protons or ?pNa for sodium ions) across the cytoplasmic membrane \n\ngenerated by an electron transfer chain that reduces a terminal acceptor (3). The \n\nelectrochemical gradient formed drives a cationic flow through ATP synthase, which causes \n\nsubunits of this enzyme to rotate, leading to conformational changes in the active site, which \n\nculminates in the formation of ATP from ADP and Pi (4). Two major types of oxidative \n\nphosphorylation, also called respiration, emerged differing in the electron acceptors used. \n\nThese respiratory organisms used both SLP and ETP pathways using a diverse range of \n\nelectron donors/acceptors for energy conservation (Table 1.1). Anaerobic respiration \n\nemerged first, using reduced compounds such as sulfur or iron as electron acceptors. After \n\nthe rise of atmospheric oxygen concentration caused by the metabolism of photosynthetic \n\norganisms, aerobic respiration emerged using oxygen as terminal electron acceptor. Since \n\noxygen has a higher redox potential (E\n0\n\u2019) than the electron acceptors used in anaerobic \n\nrespiration it permits the release of more energy per oxidized molecule. \n\n Although it is classically considered that fermentative organisms do not perform \n\nrespiration, recent studies indicate that their energy conservation mechanisms may be more \n\ncomplex. There are several examples of an electrochemical gradient necessary for ATP \n\nsynthesis being formed in the membrane of fermentative organisms, such as by electrogenic \n\ntransport in lactic acid bacteria (5), electron transfer through energy-conserving \n\n\n\n 3 \n\nhydrogenases in hyperthermophiles (6), and also by sodium-translocating NADH \n\ndehydrogenases in glutamate fermenting bacteria (7). \n\n \n\nTable 1.1 \u2013 Redox potential of electron donors/acceptors involved in electron transport \n\nphosphorylation.

This mechanism couples a thermodynamically \n\nunfavorable reaction (often the reduction of ferredoxin) to a favorable reaction. Reduced \n\nferredoxin (Fd) then functions as an electron and energy carrier and its oxidation can be \n\nlinked to energy conservation. At the base of FBEB is a stepwise electron transfer from a \n\nreduced flavin co-factor (FADH2) in which the low-potential electron is used for reduction of a \n\nhigh potential electron acceptor, while the second electron reduces Fd (Figure 1.2) (9). The \n\nreduction of low potential Fd is only possible since a lower redox potential flavin semiquinone \n\n(\u201chot flavosemiquinone\u201d) is formed after the first electron is transferred to the high potential \n\nelectron acceptor (10). The logic behind FBEB is similar to the Q-cycle proposed by Peter \n\nMitchell, involving a quinone electron bifurcation at the bc1 complex (11). Energy conservation \n\n\n\n 4 \n\nvia reduced Fd occurs by either proton reduction to H2, increasing SLP in the oxidative branch \n\nof fermentation, or by generation of an electrochemical gradient via the Rnf membrane \n\ncomplex (8). The Rnf complex (for Rhodobacter nitrogen fixation) is a H\n+\n/Na\n\n+\n-pumping \n\nFd:NAD\n+ \n\noxidoreductase found in many anaerobes (12). Since low redox potential Fd is \n\nrequired by autotrophs to reduce CO2, FBEB might have been important, if not essential, \n\nduring early life evolution (13). \n\n 1.1.3 \u2013 FBEB examples \n\n The FBEB mechanism was first observed in the Gram-positive bacterium Clostridium \n\nkluyveri (9), which is able to ferment ethanol and acetate to butyrate, caproate, and H2, a \n\nunique feature among clostridia (14). H2 formation was shown to be Fd-dependent, requiring \n\nacetyl-CoA for reduction of crotonyl-CoA to butyryl-CoA. Also, H2 was formed by an \n\nendergonic reaction during fermentation from NADH. The work of Li et al. revealed that the \n\ncytoplasmic butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase/electron transfer complex (BcdA/EtfBC complex) \n\nwas responsible for coupling Fd reduction with NADH to the reduction of crotonyl-CoA to \n\nbutyryl-CoA with NADH (Figure 1.2) (9). Since this complex contains four FAD cofactors with \n\nno additional prosthetic groups this new energy conservation mechanism was named flavin-\n\nbased electron bifurcation. Other examples of FBEB enzymes are the NfnAB complex \n\npresent in C. kluyveri, which couples the reduction of Fd with NADPH to the reduction of \n\nNAD\n+\n (15) and the reverse electron bifurcation (confurcation) Hase (HydABC) present in \n\nThermotoga maritima, which couples the oxidation of Fd and NADH to generate H2 (16). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2 \u2013 Flavin-based electron bifurcation mechanism by Bcd/EtfCB from Clostridium kluyveri. \n\nThe endergonic reduction of Fd by NADH is coupled to the exergonic reduction of crotonyl-CoA \n\nwith NADH.

The mechanism for heterodisulfide reduction \n\nis distinct in methanogens with cytochromes from methanogens without cytochromes (17). In \n\nmethanogens with cytochromes VhoACG hydrogenase/HdrDE heterodisulfide reductase \n\nmembrane complex couples H2 oxidation to heterodisulfide reduction and proton pumping \n\n(18). In methanogens without cytochromes the MvhADG hydrogenase/HdrABC \n\nheterodisulfide reductase cytoplasmic complex couples the reduction of Fd (unfavorable step) \n\nwith H2 to the reduction of the heterodisulfide by H2 (favorable step) in a FBEB mechanism \n\n(Figure 1.3) (19). Interestingly, we can find HdrABC related proteins in non-methanogenic \n\norganisms in which the function of these proteins remains unsolved. The most evident of \n\nthese Hdr-containing organisms are the sulfate-reducing organisms (SRO) group, whose \n\nenergy metabolism remains incompletely understood.

SRO live in anaerobic conditions such as marine \n\nsediments, fresh waters, soil and also in the mouth and gut of some animals, including \n\nhumans. Due to the high concentration of sulfate in sea water (~28 mM) they are more \n\nabundant in marine environments and are responsible for 50 % of total carbon mineralization \n\nin marine sediments (24). This group of organisms is capable of anaerobic respiration, \n\nperforming energy conservation through reduction of sulfate to sulfide. Also, since these \n\norganisms are able to use a vast variety of compounds as electron donors and electron \n\nacceptors, they have a great potential for biotechnological applications, such as \n\nbioremediation. Furthermore it was reported that sulfate-reducing bacteria can cause \n\ninflammatory bowel diseases in animals and humans (25). \n\n \n\n adh1  adh2  floxB  floxA  floxC\nD \n\n hdrB  hdrA   hdrC  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n  \nFAD \n\nFAD \n\n  \n\nNADH \n\nNAD\n+\n\n \n\nFd\nox\n\n Fdred \n\nFloxA \n\nFloxCD \n\nFloxB \n\nHdrA HdrC \n\nHdrB \n\n2-\n\n \n\n\n\n 7 \n\n 1.2.1 \u2013 Sulfur cycle \n\n Sulfur is one of the most abundant elements on Earth and it can be found in different \n\noxidation states, being sulfate (SO4\n2-\n\n; oxidation state +6), elemental sulfur (S\n0\n; oxidation state \n\n0), and sulfide (S\n2-\n\n; oxidation state -2) the most significant in nature (26, 27). The sulfur \n\nbiogeochemical cycle is not only important in geology since many minerals are composed of \n\nsulfur but is also essential in biology since amino acids (cysteine and methionine) and many \n\nother biomolecules contain sulfur atoms. SRO play a critical role in the sulfur cycle since they \n\nuse sulfate as terminal electron acceptor in the degradation of organic matter to produce \n\nsulfide (Figure 1.6). Both these sulfur forms are used in the metabolism of other organisms \n\ngenerating the microbial sulfur cycle (26).

Sulfide can then \n\nbe oxidized aerobically by chemolithotrophic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (e.g. Thiobacillus or \n\nBeggiatoa spp.) or anaerobically by phototrophic sulfur bacteria (e.g. Chlorobium spp.) to \n\nelemental sulfur (S\n0\n) and sulfate. Other transformations, which are carried out by specialized \n\ngroups of microorganisms, result in sulfur reduction (e.g. Desulfuromonas spp.) and sulfur \n\ndisproportionation (e.g. Desulfovibrio sulfodismutans). Adapted from (24). \n \n\n 1.2.2 \u2013 Physiology and Biochemistry \n\n SRO are chemoheterotrophs since they generate their energy through chemical \n\nreactions and require organic carbon for cell growth. They are also capable of either \n\nlithotrophic or organotrophic growth since they can use a great diversity of electron donors \n\nsuch as hydrogen, fatty acids, aromatic compounds, sugars, monocarboxylic acids, and \n\ndicarboxylic acids (29). Sulfate is not the sole terminal electron acceptor in SRO, as other \n\nS\n0\n\n \n\nSO\n4\n\n H\n2\nS \n\nS\n0\n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nS\n0\n\n \n\nOrganic \nsulfur \n\nDissimilatory reduction  \n 2-\n\n \n\n\n\n 8 \n\nsulfur compounds can also be used such as sulfite (SO3\n2-\n\n), thiosulfate (S2O3\n2-\n\n), elemental \n\nsulfur (S\n0\n), and organosulfonates. Moreover, some species of SRO can use other electron \n\nacceptors as nitrate and nitrite, which are reduced to ammonium and also metal ion oxides \n\nincluding iron (Fe\nIII\n), uranyl (U\n\nVI\n), selenite (Se\n\nVI\n), chromate (Cr\n\nVI\n), and arsenate (As\n\nVI\n) \n\ntherefore revealing a great potential in bioremediation of toxic metals (24). \n\n Many organisms including bacteria, fungi, algae, and plants are capable of \n\nassimilatory sulfate reduction in which small amounts of sulfide are produced and \n\nincorporated into sulfur-containing amino acids, vitamins and cofactors (30). SRO perform \n\ndissimilatory sulfate reduction, i.e. the reduction of sulfate for energy conservation while \n\nproducing large amounts of sulfide, a toxic gas in the protonated form. Moreover, some \n\nsulfate reducers are able to survive in low concentrations of oxygen, showing that these \n\norganisms are not strict anaerobes (31). \n\n 1.2.3 \u2013 Taxonomy \n\n The first SRO to be isolated and described was named Spirillum desulfuricans due to \n\nits morphology and ability to produce sulfide from sulfate (32). This discovery dates from 1895 \n\nand was attributed to the Dutch microbiologist and botanist Martinus Beijerinck; the bacterium \n\nwas later reclassified as Desulfovibrio desulfuricans (Figure 1.7). Classification of these \n\norganisms was based on phenotypic characteristics, which limited the number of species until \n\nthe 1980\u2019s. With the advent of Molecular Biology new methods based on the rRNA 16S gene, \n\nPCR, and genome sequencing started to emerge and were used to discover numerous novel \n\nspecies of SRO (24). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.7 \u2013 The figure is a reproduction of Vibrio desulfuricans, which was painted by Henri\u00ebtte \n\nBeijerinck, the sister of Martinus Beijerinck, and is reproduced courtesy of the Beijerinck Museum \n\n(24). \n\n   \n\n\n\n 9 \n\n There are more than 220 species of 60 genera of SRO described, either from the \n\nBacteria or Archaea Domain. Within the Bacteria Domain, these organisms belong to five \n\ndivisions: Deltaproteobacteria class (including Desulfovibrio and 11 other genus), Nitrospira \n\nphylum (containing the genus Thermodesulfovibrio), Clostridia class (containing the Gram-\n\npositive, spore-forming genus Desulfotomaculum, Desulfosporomusa, and \n\nDesulfosporosinus), Thermodesulfobiaceae family, and Thermodesulfobacteria phylum. \n\nWithin the Archaea Domain, two phyla are distinguished: Euryarchaeota (containing the \n\nArchaeoglobus genus) and Crenarchaeota (containing the genus Thermocladium and \n\nCaldivirga) (Figure 1.8) (24, 29). From these organisms, 72 genome sequences are already \n\navailable according to the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) website. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.8 \u2013 Phylogenetic tree of the SRO described, based on 16S ribossomal RNA (rRNA) \n\nsequences. It is possible to observe five phylogenetic lineages of Bacteria Domain organisms and \n\ntwo of Archaea Domain organisms. The 0.10 scale bar indicates 10 % of sequence difference. \n\nFrom (24). \n\n\n\n 10 \n\n 1.2.4 \u2013 Environmental impact \n\n SRO have an important environmental impact since they intervene in biocorrosion of \n\nferrous metals and also corrosion of concrete and stonework (29). These microorganisms \n\nalso have a negative impact on the petroleum industry since they can contribute to a \n\nphenomenon called \u201coil souring\u201d by sulfide production in oil fields and pipelines. \n\n Since SRO have a very plastic metabolism they have a great biotechnological \n\npotential. These microorganisms are capable of bioremediation of several compounds by \n\noxidation, such as organic compounds, monoaromatic hydrocarbons present in contamination \n\ndue to petroleum spills; reduction of halogenated compounds, which contaminate waters and \n\nsediment, and are used as terminal electron acceptor (dehalorespiration); nitroaromatic \n\nrespiration, such as TNT (trinitrotoluene) which contaminates soils and ground water near \n\nplaces where explosives are manufactured (29). Also, SRO are capable of immobilization of \n\nhazardous and toxic metals released by metallurgic plants, nuclear plants or oil refining \n\nindustry via precipitation as metal sulfides. A restricted group of SRO called DMRB \n\n(dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria) is capable of toxic metal reduction (such as uranium) \n\nposing an important contribution for toxic environment bioremediation. Reduction of azo dyes, \n\nwhich contain an azo bond (N=N) and are abundantly produced in the textile industry, is also \n\nperformed by this group of organisms; finally, SRO are capable of biorecovery of precious \n\nmetals such as gold, platinum, or palladium from industrial waste streams (33). \n\n Concerning the high potential of SRO in biotechnology, the study of the physiology \n\nand full comprehension of the metabolism of these organisms is imperative to further develop \n\nnew and more powerful biotechnological tools. \n\n \n\n \n\n 1.3 \u2013 The Desulfovibrio genus \n \n\n Desulfovibrio is one of many genus of sulfate-reducing bacteria belonging to the \n\nDeltaproteobacteria class. Desulfovibrio species exist in marine environents, but also in hot \n\nsprings, geothermal vents, the human digestive tract, and in soil (34). These bacteria are not \n\nstrict anaerobes as previously considered, since they tolerate oxygen concentration but their \n\ngrowth is limited in aerobic environments. The optimal growth temperature for the mesophilic \n\nDesulfovibrio bacteria ranges from 25 \u2013 40 \u00baC while the optimal pH ranges between 6.6 \u2013 7.5. \n\nSince D. vulgaris Hildenborough was the first SRO to have its genome sequenced and due to \n\nits easy and rapid growth it has been used as a model for studying the physiology, genetics, \n\nand biochemistry of these organisms (35). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 11 \n\n 1.3.1 \u2013 Morphology, biochemistry, and genome features \n\n Desulfovibrio species are non-sporulating curved rod-shaped cells with sizes \n\nbetween 0.5 \u2013 1.3 x 0.8 \u2013 5 ?m (36). These cells are motile with a single polar flagellum and \n\nstain Gram negative. These microbes use hydrogen, organic acids, or alcohols as electron \n\ndonors for sulfate reduction. Lactate is preferentially used for carbon metabolism but \n\npyruvate, formate, and certain primary alcohols also function as carbon sources. The model \n\norganism D. vulgaris Hildenborough was discovered and isolated in 1946 in clay soil near \n\nHildenborough, Kent, England (35). The genome contains two replicons: one chromosome \n\ncontaining 3.57 Mbp and one mega plasmid containing 202 kbp. The GC percentage of the \n\nreplicons is 63.2 and 65.7, respectively (35). \n\n 1.3.2 \u2013 Taxonomy \n\n D. vulgaris Hildenborough belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria and class \n\nDeltaproteobacteria. The order of these bacteria is Desulfovibrionales, the family is \n\nDesulfovibrionacea and the genus is Desulfovibrio. In the last decade several genomes of \n\nSRO were sequenced and deposited in online databases such as MicrobesOnline, Integrated \n\nMicrobial Genomes (IMG), and National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). There \n\nare over 60 known species of the Desulfovibrio genus, from which 43 genomes are available \n\naccording to the IMG website. Very recently, the genome of Desulfovibrio gigas was \n\nsequenced through a collaboration between a group at ITQB and Brazilian researchers (37). \n\n 1.3.3 \u2013 Dissimilatory sulfate reduction \n\n Dissimilatory sulfate reduction occurs in the cytoplasm of SRO and requires the \n\npresence of four soluble enzymes. In order to fully reduce sulfate to sulfide, eight electrons \n\nare necessary and approximately two ATP molecules are used for sulfate activation (Figure \n\n1.9). Sulfate is transported inside the cell by symport with Na\n+\n or H\n\n+\n, depending on the marine \n\nor fresh-water environment, respectively (38). Since sulfate reduction to sulfite is chemically \n\nunfavorable [E\no,\n (SO4\n\n2-\n/SO3\n\n2-\n) = \u2013 516 mV] sulfate requires activation to a more favorable \n\ncompound. In the presence of the ATP sulfurylase or adenylyltransferase (Sat), sulfate and \n\nATP are converted to adenosine-5\u2019-phosphosulfate (APS generating pyrophosphate (PPi). \n\nSome SRO have membrane associated pyrophosphatases that couple the hydrolysis of PPi \n\nto proton translocation across the membrane minimizing the energy costs of sulfate reduction \n\n(20). APS [E\no,\n (APS/SO3\n\n2-\n) = \u2013 60 mV] accepts two electrons being reduced to sulfite and \n\nAMP by the APS reductase enzyme (AprBA). The physiological electron donor to AprBA is \n\nstill unknown but several lines of evidence point to the Quinone-interacting membrane-bound \n\noxidoreductase (QmoABC) membrane complex (39, 40). After sulfite formation, the final \n\nreduction of sulfite to sulfide [E\no,\n (SO3\n\n2-\n/H2S) = \u2013 116 mV] requires 6 electrons and two \n\nmechanisms were proposed to explain this reduction: the trithionate pathway, in which sulfite \n\nis reduced to sulfide in three steps, by the intermediates trithionate (S3O6\n2-\n\n) and thiosulfate \n\n(S2O3\n2-\n\n) (32); and the second mechanism, which explains the 6 electron reduction in only one \n\n\n\n 12 \n\nstep, catalyzed by the dissimilatory sulfite reductase (DsrAB or dSir) without formation of any \n\nintermediates (41). There is evidence that a third protein, named DsrC but not encoded in the \n\nsame operon of DsrA and DsrB, is involved in the final reduction of sulfite to sulfide (41). \n\nDsrC functions not as a subunit of DsrAB but as an interacting protein by entering the cleft \n\nbetween DsrA and DsrB, as the crystal structure of DsrAB-DsrC complex from D. vulgaris \n\nrevealed (41). DsrK (a subunit from the DsrMKJOP membrane complex) functions as the \n\npotential physiological electron donor to DsrC (42). Since the dsrMKJOP gene cluster is in \n\nclose proximity to a gene encoding a Fd, there might be an involvement of a Fd in sulfite \n\nreduction and other soluble electron transfer pathways (20). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.9 \u2013 Schematic representation of the proposed model of dissimilatory sulfate reduction \n\npathway.

Cube \u2013 [4Fe-4S]; diamond - [2Fe-2S];  \u2013 heme b;  \u2013 heme c;  \u2013 \n\nsirohydrochlorine. \n\n \n \n \n\n Immediately downstream from the dsrAB genes a small gene named dsrD which \n\ncodes for a 9 kDa protein is present (43). This gene is specific of SRO, although dsrD is \n\nabsent in some thiosulfate reducers (e.g. Thermosinus carboxydivorans and \n\nThermanaeromonas toyohensis) and is also not present in sulfur-oxidizing organisms (44). \n\nFurthermore, in the anaerobic taurine-degrading gut bacterium Bilophila wadsworthia \n\nRZATAU the dsrD gene is fused to the dsrB gene, forming a DsrB-DsrD fusion protein (45). \n\nInterestingly it has also been shown that dsrD is strongly downregulated in the presence of \n\nsulfide (46). These results suggest a possible involvement of DsrD in the dissimilatory sulfite \n\n\n\n 13 \n\nreduction. However, DsrD was not found associated with DsrAB during the purification \n\nmethods and in vitro studies revealed that this protein binds sulfate, sulfite, and sulfide with \n\nlow affinity (47). Since the structure of DsrD includes a winged-helix motif, a B- and Z-DNA \n\nbinding motif, it has been hypothesized that DsrD is associated to sulfate reduction not in a \n\ndirect biochemical association but via regulation of sulfite reduction genes (Figure 1.10) (48). \n\nDespite some structural, biophysical, and biochemical studies performed with this protein, the \n\nphysiological function of DsrD remains to be solved. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.10 \u2013 (A) Stereo view of DsrD from D. vulgaris Hildenborough at 1.2 \u00c5 resolution.

It was \n\nultimately desired to elucidate and better understand the metabolic importance of this gene \n\ncluster and to analyze in which conditions these genes were more expressed both at a gene \n\nand protein level. \n\n The second part of this thesis focuses on the study of dsrD, a potentially relevant \n\ngene involved in the dissimilatory sulfate reduction whose function in the physiology of SRO \n\nremains a mystery. The main objective of this study is to provide new hints about the function \n\nof this protein both with in vitro and in vivo assays, while contributing to a better \n\nunderstanding of the dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathway, in particular in the sulfite \n\nreduction.\n\n\n\n 15 \n\n   3 \u2013 Materials and Methods \n\n \n\n 3.1 \u2013 hdr-flox gene cluster \n\n 3.1.1 \u2013 Strains and media \n\n The strains used in this work were previously constructed by Fabian Grein (49) and \n\nare listed in Table 3.1. All D. vulgaris Hildenborough strains were grown in anaerobic \n\nconditions, in MOY basal medium (39). MOY medium contains 8 mM MgCl2, 20 mM NH4Cl, \n\n0.6 mM CaCl2, 2 mM K2HPO4-NaH2PO4, 0.06 mM FeCl, 0.12 mM EDTA, 30 mM Tris-HCl pH \n\n7.4, 1 g/L of yeast extract, 6 mL of trace element solution (39), and 1 mL of Thauers vitamins \n\nsolution (50) per liter. Thauer\u2019s vitamin solution contains 82 ?M biotin, 45 ?M folic acid, \n\n468 ?M pyridoxine hydrochloride, 148 ?M thiamine hydrochloride, 133 ?M riboflavin, 406 ?M \n\nnicotinic acid, 210 ?M DL-panthotenic acid, 365 ?M p-aminobenzoic acid, 242 ?M lipoic acid, \n\n14 mM choline chloride, and 7.4 ?M vitamin B12. Additionally, 1.2 mM thioglycolate was used \n\nas a reducing agent and 640 nM resazurin solution was used as a redox potential indicator \n\n(which becomes pink when the potential exceeds 110 mV). The pH was adjusted with 1 M \n\nHCl to the final value of 7.2. MOY was supplemented with different electron donors-acceptors \n\nin five different culture conditions: 60 mM lactate-30 mM sulfate (LS4); 30 mM lactate-20 mM \n\nsulfite (LS3); 60 mM pyruvate-2 mM sulfate (P); 40 mM ethanol-20 mM sulfate (ES4); and \n\nfinally 1 bar hydrogen (H2)-30 mM sulfate supplemented with 10 mM acetate (HS4). The \n\ncultures containing hydrogen as electron donor were gassed at 1 atm pressure with 80% H2 \n\n(v/v) and 20 % CO2 and incubated at 37 \u00b0C in a horizontal position in order to increase the \n\ngas-liquid surface area. \n\n 3.1.2 \u2013 Growth curves \n\n D. vulgaris Hildenborough WT and mutant strain cultures were grown anaerobically at \n\n37 \u00b0C in 100 mL flasks containing a final volume of 50 mL. All flasks were inoculated with 2 % \n\n(v/v) of fresh precultured cells grown on lactate-sulfate medium except for the pyruvate \n\ngrowth (P), in which cells were precultured in pyruvate medium (P), and for the media with \n\nhydrogen, in which 10 % (v/v) of pre-culture cells was used. The optical density (OD at 600 \n\nnm) was monitored at various time points with a spectrophotometer Shimadzu UV-1603. All \n\nreported optical density measurements are the mean of four biologically independent \n\nexperiments. \n\n 3.1.3 \u2013 Ethanol quantification \n\n Ethanol accumulation in the growth medium was determined with an enzymatic kit \n\nfrom NZYTech.

Total RNA was extracted as described in (52).

Cells were then \n\ndisrupted by adding 1 mL of BugBuster\n\u00ae\n Protein Extraction Reagent (Novagen\n\n\u00ae\n) and 10 ?L of \n\nlysonase per g of cells, followed by 20 min incubation with slow stirring at room temperature. \n\nThe soluble crude extract was obtained by centrifugation at 16,000 g and 4 \u00b0C for 20 min. \n\nProtein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum \n\nalbumin as standard (NZYTech). \n\n Protein samples of 25 ?g were run in a SDS-PAGE gel [12 % acrylamide, (v/v)] and \n\ntransferred to 0.45 ?m polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Roche) for 30 minutes at \n\n100 V and 350 mA in a Mini Trans-Blot\n\u00ae\n electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad) containing \n\nTransfer Buffer (48 mM Tris pH 9.2, 39 mM glycine).

The PCR product was cloned into a pET22b(+) \n\nvector (Novagen\n\u00ae\n), allowing the insertion of a 6-His tag at the C-terminus of DsrD protein. The \n\nrecombinant plasmid (pET\n22\n\ndsrD) was heat-shock transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) Gold \n\n(Stratagene\n\u00ae\n) strains which were grown at 37 \u00b0C in Minimal Medium with ampicillin (100 \n\n\u00b5g/mL) until an optical density of 0.4. Then 100 \u00b5M IPTG (isopropyl ?-D-1-\n\nthiogalactopyranoside) was added and cells were permitted to grow for 4 additional hours. \n\n 3.2.1.2 \u2013 DsrD purification \n\n The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with Buffer A (25 mM potassium \n\nphosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole pH 7.2) and frozen to \u2013 20 \u00baC. After thawing and \n\nressuspending with Buffer A the cells were disrupted using a French Press cell in the \n\npresence of DNase. Afterwards, the cell lysate was centrifuged for 15 minutes at 20,000 g in \n\norder to remove cell debris, and then ultra centrifuged for 2 h at 140,000 g to separate the \n\nmembrane from the soluble fraction. The supernatant was injected into a HiTrap Chelating \n\nHP column (GEHealthcare) charged with NiCl2 and equilibrated with Buffer A. The protein \n\nwas eluted with Buffer B (Buffer A with 100 mM imidazole) and dialyzed to 25 mM potassium \n\nphosphate pH 7. The protein purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie \n\nBlue and the concentration was determined at 280 nm using the absorption coefficient of 10 \n\nmM\n-1\n\ncm\n-1\n\n and with the BCA (bicinchoninic acid assay) kit by Pierce\n\u00ae\n. \n\n 3.2.1.3 \u2013 DsrD activity and interaction assays \n\n DsrABC was tested for sulfite reduction activity in the presence of DsrD in order to \n\nanalyze if there was any interaction between these molecules capable of modifying the \n\nreaction rate. The enzymatic activities were performed in a Coy anaerobic chamber [95 %/ 5 \n\n% (v/v) N2/H2] with a Shimadzu UV-1800 spectrophotometer in a stirred cuvette (Hellma), \n\nmonitoring the oxidation of methyl viologen (an electron acceptor reduced by Zn\n2+\n\n) mediated \n\nby DsrABC, which transfers electrons to sulfite. The assays were developed in Wash Buffer \n\n(25 mM KPi pH7) at room temperature, measuring the variation of Abs732 nm through time. \n\n BIAcore experiments were performed with DsrD and DsrABC. BIAcore is a \n\ntechnology based on the Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) principle, which permits the \n\ndetermination of affinity constants between two interacting proteins. DsrD was chemically \n\nimmobilized in a CM5 sensor chip (GE\n\u00ae\n Healthcare) to which DsrABC was injected and \n\ninteraction of these two proteins was measured. The SPR experiments were performed at \n\n25 \u00b0C on a BIAcore 2000 instrument (Biacore Inc., GE\n\u00ae\n HealthCare). \n\n\n\n 20 \n\n Additionally, Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) technique was also performed to \n\nmeasure interactions between DsrD and DsrABC or sulfite. ITC is a biophysical method that \n\nallows the measurement of thermodynamics and binding association of molecules in solution \n\nby detecting the heat change in molecular reactions. The ITC experiments were performed at \n\n25 \u00b0C on a MicroCalTM (GE\n\u00ae\n Healthcare). \n\n \n\n 3.2.2 \u2013 dsrD deletion \n\n 3.2.2.1 \u2013 Strains and media \n\n The strains used in this work are listed in Table 3.1. Escherichia coli ?-Select strain \n\nwas cultured in LB medium (per liter of medium: 10 g tryptone, 10 g sodium chloride, and 5 g \n\nyeast extract). Where indicated, kanamycin or spectinomycin was added to LB medium to a \n\nfinal concentration of 50 \u00b5g/mL and 100 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. All D. vulgaris strains were \n\ngrown at 37 \u00b0C in MOY medium according to (39). Sodium lactate (60 mM) or sodium \n\npyruvate (30 mM) were added as electron donors and sodium sulfate (30 mM for lactate and \n\n3 mM for pyruvate) or sodium sulfite (20 mM for lactate) were added as terminal electron \n\nacceptors Antibiotics were added to the MOY medium as follows: G418 (geneticin) at 400 \n\n\u00b5g/mL or spectinomycin at 100 \u00b5g/mL. G418 was used in place of kanamycin as described by \n\nZane et al. 2010. For solidified MOY medium, 15 g agar per liter was added. \n\n 3.2.2.2 \u2013 Plasmid and strain construction \n\n The pMOIP17 plasmid for insertion of ?Km cassette in dsrD was constructed by SLIC \n\n(sequence ligation independent cloning). The upstream and downstream regions flanking \n\ndsrD were amplified using the primers 97, 98, 99, and 100, respectively, (Table 3.1) and \n\nchromosomal DNA of D. vulgaris was used as template. Also, a spectinomycin resistance \n\ncassette and the pMO719 template containing pUC ori and Kanamycin resistance cassette \n\nwere all amplified by PCR, using pSC27 and pMO719, respectively, as templates and primers \n\n9, 10, 11, and 12. The four PCR products were added to a reaction mix with T4 ligase \n\nincubated for 30 min at room temperature. 1 mM dCTP (deoxycytidine triphosphate) was then \n\nadded the DNA was heat-shock transformed into E. coli ?-Select competent cells and plated \n\ninto kanamycin and spectinomycin containing LA plates. The assembled plasmid (pMOIP17) \n\nwas extracted, sequenced, and electroporated into D. vulgaris cells according to Keller et al. \n\n(2011) from which double recombinants were selected in MOY solid medium with 30 mM of \n\nsodium pyruvate by secondary antibiotic screening as described in (54). G418 was used in \n\nplace of kanamycin as described by Zane et al. (2010). G418 resistant but spectinomycin \n\nsensitive colonies were selected and allowed to grow in G418 containing growth medium. The \n\nabsence of the dsrD gene in the dsrD mutant strain was verified by PCR using the dsrD fw \n\nand dsrD rev primers with the chromosomal DNA extracted from the screened cells.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 21 \n\n 3.2.2.3 \u2013 Growth curves \n\n D. vulgaris Hildenborough WT and dsrD mutant strains were grown anaerobically at \n\n37 \u00b0C in 100 mL flasks with 50 mL of MOY basal medium (39). MOY was supplemented with \n\ndifferent electron donors-acceptors in three different culture conditions: 60 mM lactate-30 mM \n\nsulfate (LS4); 30 mM lactate-20 mM sulfite (LS3); 30 mM pyruvate-3 mM sulfate (Pyr). All \n\nmedia were inoculated with 2 % (v/v) fresh precultured cells grown in pyruvate-sulfate \n\nmedium (Pyr). The OD of the cultures was monitored at various time points with a \n\nspectrophotometer Shimadzu UV-1603. All reported optical density measurements are the \n\nmean of three biologically independent experiments. \n\n  \n\n\n\n 22 \n\n4 - Results \n \n\n 4.1 \u2013 The hdr-flox gene cluster \n\n 4.1.1 \u2013 Growth curves \n\n To evaluate the physiological function of the flox and hdr genes, the strains IPFG01 \n\n(hdrC::?Km) and IPFG02 (?floxA::Km\nR\n) were generated where a kanamycin resistance \n\ncassette was inserted in the hdrC gene, preventing translation of downstream genes \n\n(IPFG01), and the floxA gene was specifically deleted by replacement with a kanamycin \n\nresistance cassette (IPFG02). Additionally, in order to confirm that the phenotype of IPFG02 \n\nwas due to the absence of floxA, a FloxA-complemented strain expressing FloxA from a \n\nplasmid was constructed and named strain IPFG03 (IPFG02 + pMOIP12P). D. vulgaris WT, \n\nIPFG01, and IPFG02 strains were grown in lactate-sulfate (LS4), lactate-sulfite (LS3), \n\npyruvate fermentation (P), ethanol-sulfate (ES4), or hydrogen-sulfate (HS4) medium (Figure \n\n4.1, Table 4.1). The three mutant strains behaved similarly to WT using lactate as an electron \n\ndonor, both with sulfate or sulfite as terminal electron acceptors (Figure 4.1A, 4.1B), whereas \n\nin pyruvate fermentation strains IPFG01 and IPFG02 had a similar growth rate, but the final \n\nOD was slightly lower than the WT and complemented strains (Figure 4.1C). Interestingly, in \n\nethanol-sulfate conditions both mutant strains, IPFG01 or IPFG02, were unable to grow, while \n\nthe complemented strain grew to a similar growth rate and maximum OD compared to the WT \n\n(Figure 4.1D). In HS4 medium strains IPFG01 and IPFG02 grew somewhat slower than the \n\nWT and reached a lower cell density. Since IPFG02 was not capable of growing in ES4 \n\nmedium while WT and IPFG03 did, we can conclude that FloxA is essential for ethanol \n\noxidation in D. vulgaris. Ethanol has also been reported as a metabolic product of D. vulgaris \n\nHildenborough, produced in higher amounts with pyruvate as an electron donor than with \n\nlactate (55). To check whether the Hdr-Flox proteins are involved in the production of ethanol \n\nas a fermentative product during growth on pyruvate, we quantified ethanol accumulated in \n\nthe growth media of the WT and mutant strains. The WT strain accumulated a considerable \n\namount of ethanol in the growth medium, while ethanol was absent in the two mutant strains \n\nIPFG01 and IPFG02 (Figure 4.2). The complemented strain IPFG03 produced similar levels \n\nof ethanol as the WT, confirming a role of Flox-Hdr in ethanol production during pyruvate \n\nfermentation. \n\n \n\n\n\n 23 \n\n \n \nFigure 4.1 \u2013 Growth curves of D. vulgaris WT and mutant strains in (A) lactate-sulfate, (B) lactate-\n\nsulfite (C) pyruvate fermentation, (D) ethanol-sulfate, and (E) hydrogen-sulfate conditions.

The hdrA gene shows the highest expression in \n\nethanol-sulfate (ES4) followed by pyruvate fermentation (P) conditions, and lowest expression \n\nin lactate-sulfite (LS3) and hydrogen-sulfate (HS4) conditions. A similar expression behavior \n\nis observed for the floxA gene, except for the P condition where the expression is lower than \n\nin LS4.

The Western blot analysis confirms that the relative protein expression \n\nlevels of FloxA, HdrA, and Adh1 at middle exponential phase are highest in ES4 conditions. \n\nAgain, HdrA and Adh1 also show strong expression in P conditions. Overall, there is good \n\nagreement between the mRNA levels and the protein levels for the three cases. In the \n\nstationary phase the levels of FloxA decrease, except in ES4 conditions, whereas HdrA \n\nshows a strong decrease in all conditions. In contrast, Adh1 expression is even higher at the \n\nstationary phase for ES4 and LS4 conditions. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n 26 \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.4 \u2013 (A) Western blot of crude cell extracts from the mid-exponential and stationary \n\ngrowth phase of D. vulgaris grown either on lactate-sulfate (LS4), lactate-sulfite (LS3), pyruvate \n\n(P), ethanol-sulfate (ES4), and hydrogen-sulfate (HS4) medium.

Firstly, enzymatic activity \n\nassays were performed in anaerobic conditions adding DsrD to DsrAB and sulfite in a \n\nreaction mixture. Then, protein-protein interaction assays were performed with BIAcore, \n\nwhich is based on the Surface Plasmon Resonance principle and allows the determination of \n\naffinity constants. Protein-ligand interaction assays were performed with Isothermal Titration \n\nCalorimetry, a biophysical technique that allows to determine thermodynamic parameters \n\n[binding affinity (Ka), enthalpy changes (?H), and binding stoichiometry (n)] of the interaction \n\nbetween two or more molecules in solution. Despite all these attempts no evidence was \n\nobtained to support the interaction of DsrD with DsrAB, DsrC, or even sulfite. \n\n \n\n \n\nMid-exponential Beginning stationary \n\nAdh1 \n\nFloxA \n\nHdrA \n\nLS4 LS3 P ES\n4\n\nHS\n4\n\nLS4 LS3 P ES4 HS4 \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\nA \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_affinity\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthalpy\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoichiometry\n\n\n 27 \n\n 4.2.2 \u2013 Growth curves \n\n In order to understand the function of the dsrD gene in the physiology of D. vulgaris \n\ncells, a dsrD mutant was constructed by replacing the dsrD gene with a kanamycin resistance \n\ncassette. Both WT and dsrD deletion mutant were grown in pyruvate, lactate-sulfate, and \n\nlactate-sulfite medium (Figure 4.5). Both strains behaved similarly during pyruvate \n\nfermentation even though the dsrD deletion mutant reached the stationary phase a few hours \n\nafter the WT (Figure 4.5A) A more prominent phenotypic difference appears when both \n\nstrains were cultured in lactate-sulfate medium (Figure 4.5B) in which the dsrD deletion \n\nmutant shows a great increase in the lag phase compared to the WT. After the long lag \n\nphase, the mutant strain grows to a final OD similar to the observed in the WT. Interestingly, \n\nin lactate-sulfite medium (Figure 4.5C), dsrD mutant cells were not able to grow while the WT \n\nstrain reached the stationary phase after around 45 hours. \n\n \n\n \n \nFigure 4.5 \u2013 Growth curves of D. vulgaris WT and dsrD mutant strains in (A) pyruvate \n\nfermentation, (B) lactate-sulfate, and (C) lactate-sulfite medium.

Genomic studies of SRO focusing on genes involved in \n\nenergy metabolism revealed the presence of several proteins similar to enzymes of other \n\norganisms involved in FBEB, suggesting that this energy conservation mechanism is also \n\nrelevant in SRO (20). FBEB is a novel mechanism of energy conservation in anaerobes, \n\nwhich couples an exergonic reaction to the endergonic Fd reduction (56). One example of \n\nFBEB is the HdrABC-MvhADG complex in methanogens, which couples the reduction of Fd \n\nwith the reduction of CoM-S-S-CoB heterodisulfide by H2 (Figure 1.3) (17). The bifurcating \n\nprotein is believed to be the flavoprotein HdrA. HdrA and HdrABC proteins are found in many \n\nSRO, despite the absence of CoM-S-S-CoB heterodisulfide in these organisms (20). A new \n\ngene cluster hdrABC-floxABCD was found in many bacterial SRO and proposed to encode a \n\nnew putative NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (FloxABCD) forming a complex with HdrABC \n\nanalogous to the MvhADG-HdrABC complex of methanogens (20). The floxA gene codes for \n\na FAD and NAD(P)-binding domains protein, similar to the P. furiosus SH subunit ?, while the \n\nfloxB and floxC genes are related to rnfC and both code for iron-sulfur proteins similar to the \n\nP. furiosus SH subunit ? (20).The floxD gene codes for a protein similar to MvhD, which in \n\nmethanogens is involved in electron transfer from Mvh to Hdr (57). The floxC and floxD are \n\nfused into one single gene in several organisms, including D. vulgaris.  \n\n Several genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies have been performed over \n\nthe last years regarding the energy metabolism of SRO, using the model organism D. vulgaris \n\nHildenborough and other Desulfovibrio species (22), (58), (59), (60), (61). The flox-hdr genes \n\nare often affected in these studies suggesting a relevant function in the energy metabolism, \n\nalthough not essential for sulfate reduction. In D. vulgaris, the flox-hdr gene cluster is present \n\nupstream of an alcohol dehydrogenase coding gene (adh1), which is highly expressed in D. \n\nvulgaris grown with lactate, pyruvate, formate, ethanol, or hydrogen as electron donors for \n\nsulfate reduction (22). A mutant lacking this gene was unable to grow in ethanol-sulfate \n\nmedium indicating that Adh1 is the main enzyme catalyzing ethanol oxidation in D. vulgaris \n\n(22). Haveman et al. proposed that the flox-hdr genes code for a hydrogenase:heterodisulfide \n\nreductase complex involved in a hydrogen cycling mechanism (22). However, the flox genes \n\ndo not encode for a hydrogenase subunit (20). \n\n  \n\n\n\n 29 \n\n In this work, we studied the physiological function of the flox-hdr genes in D. vulgaris, \n\nwhich were demonstrated to be part of the same transcriptional unit (49). Gene and protein \n\nexpression analysis of D. vulgaris cells grown with different electron donors for sulfate or \n\nsulfite reduction showed that the highest expression of the floxA and hdrA genes is observed \n\nwhen ethanol is used as electron donor (Figure 4.3 and 4.4). Moreover, as previously \n\nreported (62), the adh1 gene is much more expressed than floxA and hdrA, further indicating \n\nthat adh1 is not part of the same operon as the flox-hdr genes. This difference in gene \n\nexpression was also reflected in the protein purification: although Adh1 was purified without \n\ndifficulty, we were not successful in isolating the Flox or Hdr proteins. FloxA could be easily \n\nidentified by Western blot in protein purification fractions, but no corresponding band would \n\nbe present in Coomassie stain of SDS-PAGE gels, which meant that the levels of FloxA \n\npresent were very low. We concluded that the transcription levels of the Flox-Hdr proteins in \n\nD. vulgaris are low, which agrees with previous microarray results (62). Despite the \n\ngeneration of strain IPFG04, with a tagged FloxA we were not able to isolate the Flox-Hdr \n\nproteins in sufficient amounts for further biochemical studies, even using cells grown in \n\nethanol. \n\n Phenotypic studies of strains IPFG01 and IPFG02 revealed that both strains are not \n\nable to grow using ethanol as an electron donor for sulfate reduction (Figure 4.1D). In the \n\ncomplemented strain IPFG03, growth with ethanol was restored confirming that the Flox-Hdr \n\nproteins and FloxA individually, are essential in the metabolic pathway for ethanol oxidation, \n\nwhich agrees with their higher expression in this condition. The probable pathway involving \n\nAdh1 and Flox-Hdr proteins starts with oxidation of ethanol by Adh1 with reduction of NAD\n+\n to \n\nNADH (Figure 5.1A). FloxA, which has a FAD and a NAD(P) binding domain, oxidizes NADH \n\nand electrons are transferred to FloxB and FloxCD. FloxCD transfers electrons to HdrABC, \n\nprobably through the MvhD-like domain in FloxCD, similarly to what happens in \n\nmethanogens. The electron acceptor of HdrABC remains a question mark. As suggested \n\nbefore (20), we propose that this electron acceptor is the cysteine containing protein DsrC \n\n(44). Since the reduction of Fd by NADH is an unfavourable reaction, and by analogy to the \n\nfunction of HdrABC in methanogens, we propose that the oxidation of NADH by FloxABCD \n\ninvolves the process of FBEB, coupling the endergonic reduction of ferredoxin by NADH to \n\nthe exergonic reduction of DsrC by NADH. Regeneration of NADH involving FloxABCD-\n\nHdrABC is essential for the bioenergetics of D. vulgaris while growing on ethanol-sulfate, but \n\nnot when the cells are growing on lactate-sulfate or pyruvate-sulfate, which agrees with the \n\nidea that pyridine nucleotides are not directly involved in the oxidation of lactate or pyruvate. \n\nWe reasoned that Hdr-Flox could instead be involved in recycling NAD\n+\n produced during \n\nAdh1 reduction of acetaldehyde to ethanol, formed as an alternative pyruvate fermentation \n\nproduct (Figure 5.2). Ethanol production from pyruvate as carbon and energy source has \n\nbeen reported before for D. vulgaris (63). FloxA could reduce NAD\n+\n with electrons coming \n\nfrom Fd oxidation by HdrABC. This reaction is favorable and would not require FBEB. Fd \n\nwould be reduced by the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (Por). Ethanol production was \n\nmeasured from D. vulgaris cells growing by pyruvate fermentation, which confirmed that the  \n\n\n\n 30 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWT strain produced significant levels of ethanol, which was not observed in the IPFG01 and \n\nIPFG02 strains, whereas ethanol production was similar in the complemented IPFG03 strain \n\n(Figure 4.2). These results reveal that the role of the Flox-Hdr proteins in fermentative \n\nconditions is to produce ethanol and thus recycling NAD\n+\n (Figure 5.1B). In conclusion, we \n\nshowed that the recently recognized FloxABCD proteins are essential for ethanol oxidation in \n\nD. vulgaris and are co-expressed with the HdrABC proteins, forming a complex that we \n\npropose to perform the coupled reduction of Fd and a disulfide (the DsrC protein in SRO) \n\nusing the FBEB mechanism. In pyruvate fermentation, the FloxABCD-HdrABC complex \n\noperates in reverse to reduce NAD\n+\n, allowing the production of ethanol and the regeneration \n\nof oxidized Fd. It is clear that the FloxABCD-HdrABC proteins are involved in the metabolism \n\nof pyridine nucleotides and thus this work contributes to a better understanding of the role of \n\nthese cofactors in SRO, which has been poorly defined so far. Importantly, it provides the first \n\nlink between these cofactors and sulfate (sulfite) reduction through the DsrC protein. In a \n\nbroader perspective, it is also important to note that the hdr-flox gene cluster is not exclusive \n\nof SRO, but is widespread among many anaerobic bacteria and thus FloxABCD constitutes a \n\nnovel family of NAD(P)H oxidoreductases. The presence of the hdr-flox gene cluster in many \n\ndifferent Bacteria and the strictly conserved organization of the genes reveal that the so far \n\nunidentified FloxABCD proteins, together with HdrABC, perform a general and important \n\nfunction in the energy metabolism of these organisms. As discussed above, the function of \n\nthis protein complex will be to oxidize NADH with reduction of Fd and a high-redox-potential \n\ndisulfide acceptor, involving the FBEB mechanism. Thus, this work identifies a new set of \n\nproteins possibly involved in FBEB, further demonstrating the importance of this mechanism \n\nin the bioenergetics of anaerobic prokaryotes (64). Future work will focus on trying to isolate \n\nthis complex from other organisms to confirm in vitro the FBEB process.  \n\n\n\n 31 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1 \u2013 Function of the HdrABC-FloxABCD complex. (A) In D. vulgaris growing on ethanol-\n\nsulfate, Adh1 oxidizes ethanol producing NADH that is oxidized by FloxABCD. Electrons are \n\ntransferred to HdrABC, which can then bifurcate them to Fd and a second electron acceptor that \n\nwe propose to be DsrC. (B) In D. vulgaris growing by pyruvate fermentation, Adh1 reduces \n\nacetaldehyde (CH3CHO) to ethanol with NADH. The NAD\n+\n produced is recycled by FloxABCD, \n\nwith electrons coming from Fdred through HdrABC. \n\n \n \n\n \n \nFigure 5.2 \u2013 Pathway of fermentative lactate and pyruvate oxidation in Desulfovibrio spp. Acetyl-\n\nCoA is mainly converted to acetyl-phosphate and this to acetate, producing ATP by substrate-level \n\nphosphorylation.

In D. vulgaris \n\nHildenborough, dsrD is present in the operon dsrABD, in which the first two genes code for \n\nthe dissimilatory sulfite reductase (DsrAB) (43). DsrAB is present in all SRO and together with \n\nDsrC is responsible for the reduction of sulfite to sulfide. Additionally, in the taurine-degrading \n\nBilophila wadsworthia the dsrD gene is fused to the dsrB gene, forming a DsrB-DsrD fusion \n\nprotein (45). These data suggest that DsrD may play a direct biochemical role in reduction of \n\nsulfite to sulfide. However, Hittel et al. have shown that DsrD binds sulfur species such as \n\nsulfite, sulfide, and sulfate with low affinity (47) and also DsrD is not found associated with \n\nDsrAB following purification. The tri-dimensional structure of DsrD reveals protein homology \n\nto DNA binding proteins and the presence of one winged-helix domain (48). Winged helix \n\nproteins, a sub-family of the helix-turn-helix protein family, contain DNA-binding domains that \n\ncould bind either Z- or B-DNA. Furthermore, the proteins in the DsrD family have a well-\n\nconserved sequence (YWSSGSTT) near their C terminus which may be related to DNA \n\nbinding (48). \n\n In this work the purified recombinant DsrD was tested for interaction with DsrAB, \n\nDsrC, and sulfite both by enzymatic activity and biophysical assays (BIAcore and Isothermal \n\nTitration Calorimetry) providing no positive results. Furthermore, a deletion mutant of the dsrD \n\ngene was constructed. In the growth curves we observed that in comparison to the WT, the \n\ndsrD mutant had a long lag phase in lactate-sulfate medium, which was not detectable in \n\npyruvate fermentation medium, therefore allowing us to conclude that dsrD is involved in \n\nsulfate respiration. However, after about 45 hours, the mutant strain started to grow, reaching \n\nthe same OD as the WT. Korte et al. observed the same phenotypic phenomenon when D. \n\nvulgaris cells were grown in the presence of high concentrations of nitrate, an inhibitor of \n\nSRO. They concluded that nitrate resistance in WT cultures was likely conferred by \n\nspontaneous mutations, which allowed cell growth in nitrate-stress after a few days (65). This \n\nresult may tell us not only that the dsrD deleted strain undergoes spontaneous mutations that \n\neventually allow adaptation to sulfate medium but also that dsrD may be regulating dsrAB and \n\nhence affect the respiratory pathway. This adaptation is thought to occur in genes with \n\nredundant function as the one as dsrD, allowing to bypass the mutation phenotype. In sulfite \n\ngrowing cultures it was interesting to observe that the mutant strain was not able to grow. \n\nThis may be caused by the fact that dsrD deletion strain is more susceptible to sulfite in high \n\nconcentrations than the WT due to the importance of this gene in sulfite reduction. This \n\ninteresting result tells us that dsrD is in fact related to sulfate/sulfite respiration, yet at which \n\nlevel and how that regulation is performed are still questions to be answered. Future work will \n\nfocus on determining the ability of DsrD to interact with DNA in vitro, confirming therefore the \n\nregulatory function of this protein in the dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathway. It would also \n\nbe interesting to analyze which genes substitute the function of dsrD allowing adaptation of \n\nthe mutant strain to sulfate medium and also what is the actual contribution of these genes to \n\nthe dissimilatory sulfate reduction. \n\n\n\n 33 \n\nReferences \n \n\n \n\n1.
