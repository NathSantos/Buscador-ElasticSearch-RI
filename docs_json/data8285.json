Visual parameters are influenced mainly by ecological \nfactors, but phylogenetic relationships are also a factor that may explain the \ndistribution of retinal cells in myctophids. In conclusion, all species in this study \nshowed high visual sensitivity and low acuity, suggesting a great adaptation to \nmesopelagic light conditions. \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n1 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable of contents \n\n1.

Introduction \n\nThe mesopelagic zone is the region in the water column between 200 and 1000 m depth, defined \n\nas the oceanic layer where sunlight penetration is insufficient for photosynthesis but allows the \n\nfauna to differentiate between day and night (Douglas et al., 1995; Turner et al., 2009; Robinson et \n\nal., 2010; Sutton, 2013). Known also as dysphotic or twilight zone, the mesopelagic layer \n\nrepresents the transition from the upwards epipelagic photic zone to the aphotic downwards \n\nbathypelagic zone (Salvanes &amp; Kristoffersen, 2001; Robinson et al., 2010; Sutton, 2013). Although \n\nbiophysical conditions become more stable over time and space in the mesopelagic zone, it \n\npresents a gradient in environmental parameters (Robinson et al., 2010; Sutton, 2013). \n\nEnvironmental conditions at mesopelagic depths are very particular, showing mainly dim light, \n\ncold waters with oxygen minimum levels, reduced turbulence, increased hydrostatic pressure, high \n\ninorganic nutrient concentrations and irregular food supply (Robinson et al., 2010; Catul et al., \n\n2011). Mesopelagic zone may be split at 600-700 m depth as upper and lower mesopelagic \n\n(Warrant &amp; Locket, 2004; Sutton, 2013). The upper mesopelagic is illuminated essentially by \n\ndownwelling sunlight and its incidence on objects creates extended light scenes whilst lower \n\nmesopelagic is dominated by bioluminescent flashes, representing a different light scene with point \n\nsource light (Wagner et al., 1998; Warrant &amp; Locket, 2004; Yakir et al., 2013). The adaptation of \n\ndeep-sea fishes to one or both light conditions varies interspecifically, depending on ecological \n\ndrivers, environment (changing nature of visual scenes), and species-specific ecological traits \n\n(natural histories) (Warrant &amp; Locket, 2004).  Camouflage strategies change through the \n\nmesopelagic zone in relation to light source types and regimes. At the upper mesopelagic zone, \n\nfishes generally present silver coloration and large photophores, as an adaptation for predator \n\navoidance in dim light, whilst at the lower mesopelagic zone, where light penetration is diminished, \n\nfishes are dark-coloured, from black to crimson (Warrant &amp; Locket, 2004; Catul et al., 2011; \n\nSutton, 2013).  \n\nAt mesopelagic depths, sources of the available monochromatic and dim light (Fig. 1) are \n\ndownwelling sunlight and bioluminescence (Douglas et al., 1995; Haddock et al., 2010; Johnsen, \n\n2005; Lythgoe &amp; Partridge, 1989). The downwelling light available corresponds only to a narrow \n\nblue-green bandwidth, with wavelength between 470-490 nm (Douglas et al., 1995; Turner et al., \n\n2009).  \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Scheme of light spectra and intensity distributions along the oceanic depths and zones. From \n\nEvans &amp; Fernald (1990). \n\n \n\nConsidering that about 80% of the deep-sea species are bioluminescent and the sunlight is \n\nscarcely penetrating down to these depths, bioluminescence is the most important light source to \n\nanimals living in mesopelagic and deeper depths (Douglas et al., 1995; Douglas et al., 1998; \n\nTurner et al., 2009; Sutton, 2013). Bioluminescence light presents spectral emission maxima \n\n(?Imax) of 450-520 nm (Partridge et al., 1989; Turner et al., 2009). Biological light production by \n\nmesopelagic fishes is used, for instance, for intraspecific identification and communication and \n\ninterspecific purposes - attraction and identification of prey (Turner et al., 2009; Haddock et al., \n\n2010). Bioluminescence is widely used for camouflage functions, mostly for counterillumination, \n\nwhere for instance prey\u2019s ventral photophores match the downwelling light disrupting their \n\nsilhouettes for the downside viewer, the predator with monochromatic retinas (Cocker, 1978; \n\nJohnsen et al., 2004; Turner et al., 2009; Haddock et al., 2010). Other examples of the biological \n\nproduced light function include lures to illuminate prey (e.g. the barbell of stomiids), luminous \n\nflashes, and smokescreen to startle or confuse predators (e.g., squids and crustaceans) (Cocker, \n\n1978; Haddock et al., 2010). \n\nMesopelagic conditions influence distribution and behaviour of fauna, with remarkable \n\nbehavioural, physiological and morphological adaptations (Robinson et al., 2010; Catul et al., 2011; \n\nSutton, 2013). At these depths many animals retreat during daytime from visual predators (\u201canti-\n\npredator-window\u201d), as many species, mostly from the upper mesopelagic zone, perform diel \n\nvertical migrations (DVM) (Salvanes &amp; Kristoffersen, 2001; Robinson et al., 2010; Sutton, 2013). \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDVM behaviour aims at feeding during the night at shallower depths while staying in relative \n\ninactivity at mesopelagic depths during daytime (Robinson et al., 2010; Sutton, 2013). DVM is a \n\ncrucial process for energy exchange between lower and higher trophic levels and it also has an \n\nimportant contribution for the biological pump of organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus at \n\ndeeper waters (Bergstad et al., 2003; Robinson et al., 2010). Over 90% of the organic carbon is \n\nvertically exported from epipelagic and turned back into carbon dioxide by mesopelagic \n\ncommunities from respiration, faecal pellets, predation and dissolved organic matter (Robinson et \n\nal., 2010).  \n\nAs a dim scene of light changing conditions, essentially for DVM species, mesopelagic zone is \n\na habitat where species with the most remarkable visual adaptations are found. Light sensitivity is \n\ncrucial to fishes for DVM both for perceiving bioluminescent signals and for matching its own \n\ncounterillumination to downwelling light (Robinson et al. 2010).  \n\n \n\n1.1. Vision of deep-sea fishes \n\nIn an environment where light has such an important ecological role, mesopelagic fishes rely \n\nmainly on the sense of vision (Cocker, 1978). In fact, mesopelagic fishes have an optic tectum \n\nmore developed than other sensorial brain parts (Collin et al., 2000; Salvanes &amp; Kristoffersen, \n\n2001; Wagner, 2002), and in some cases (e.g. myctophids) the pineal organ presents an extraocular \n\nphotoreceptor and is able to discriminate slow environmental light shifts (Young et al., 1979; \n\nBowmaker &amp; Wagner, 2004). Also, deep-sea fishes may be able to detect dim sunlight down to \n\n1150 m depth (Denton &amp; Warren, 1957). These fishes evolved in order to exceptionally adapt to \n\nthe extreme environmental conditions, by developing sensitive monochromatic vision at dim light \n\n(O\u2019Day &amp; Fernandez, 1976; Pankhurst, 1987; Yokoyama &amp; Yokoyama, 1996). The main ocular \n\nadaptations are: large eyes and pupils, with aphakic gap (Yokoyama &amp; Yokoyama, 1996; Warrant \n\n&amp; Locket, 2004; Turner et al., 2009; de Busserolles et al, 2014); shortwave lens (Douglas et al., \n\n1995; Douglas et al., 1998); fovea (Wagner et al., 1998; Warrant &amp; Locket, 2004); tapetum \n\nlucidum (O\u2019Day &amp; Fernandez, 1976; Pankhurst, 1987; de Busserolles et al., 2014); multiple banks \n\narrangement of the retina (Pankhurst, 1987; Wagner, 2002); pure-rod retina (O\u2019Day &amp; Fernandez, \n\n1976; Pankhurst, 1987; de Busseroles et al., 2014); high density of large photoreceptor cells \n\n(Denton &amp; Warren, 1957; Pankhurst, 1987; Hope et al., 1997; Hunt et al., 2001; Sabat\u00e9s et al., \n\n2003); high photoreceptors-ganglion cells convergence ratio (McNulty, 1976; Locket, 1980; \n\nWagner, 2002); large-sized retinal photoreceptor outer segments (Pankhurst, 1987; Partridge et al., \n\n1989); and high concentration of single pigmented rhodopsin (O\u2019Day &amp; Fernandez, 1976; Cocker, \n\n1978; Partridge et al., 1989; Hope et al., 1997; Hunt et al., 2001).  \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLarger eyes present larger pupils allowing maximization of light entering the eye and, \n\nconsequently long visual range, higher visual sensitivity and acuity (Douglas et al., 1998; Warrant \n\n&amp; Locket, 2004).  \n\nThe aphakic gap is an \u201cextension\u201d of the pupil located between the lens and the iris, permitting \n\nthe entrance of light from oblique angles without passing through the lens (Warrant &amp; Locket, 2004; \n\nde Busserolles, 2013). Therefore, aphakic gaps allow higher visual sensitivity in detriment of acuity \n\n(Douglas et al., 1998; Warrant &amp; Locket, 2004; de Busserolles, 2013). Two types of aphakic gaps \n\nare classified: rostral and circumlental. Rostral aphakic gaps focus frontal light on the temporal part \n\nof the retina, enhancing light projection onto this area, while the circumlental aphakic gap \n\nsurrounds the entire lens, increasing light entrance from all directions (Warrant &amp; Locket, 2004; de \n\nBusserolles, 2013).  \n\nLenses are transparent structures, which grow continually through life, and refract the incident \n\nlight, focusing an image on the retina (Douglas et al., 1998; Warrant &amp; Locket, 2004). It allows \n\ngreater visual acuity proportionally to the lens size, as focal length enhances with lenses\u2019 diameter \n\n(Collin &amp; Pettigrew, 1989; Warrant &amp; Locket, 2004).  \n\nLight enters the eye (Fig. 2A) through the pupil (conditioned by the aphakic gap, when present), \n\nrefracted by the lens and focused on the retina (Warrant &amp; Locket, 2004; de Busserolles, 2013). \n\nThe retina receives the light of the surroundings and sends it through the optical nerve, as an \n\nelectric signal to the animal\u2019s brain (Collin &amp; Pettigrew, 1989; Wagner et al., 1998; Warrant &amp; \n\nLocket, 2004; de Busserolles, 2013). The retina is a thin multi-layered tissue composed by different \n\ntypes of neurons (Fig. 2B) (O\u2019Day &amp; Fernandez, 1976; Wagner et al., 1998; de Busserolles, 2013). \n\nThe retina\u2019s outer side (scleral) is composed by visual cells (photoreceptors (PRs)) that receive and \n\ntranslate the light information into an electrical signal (Wagner et al., 1998; Ullmann et al., 2011; \n\nde Busserolles, 2013). This electric impulse is transmitted synaptically through multi-layered \n\ninterneurons (plexiform layer) to the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) on the inner (vitreal) side \n\n(Wagner et al., 1998; de Busserolles, 2013). \n\nAmong different types of interneurons are the amacrine cells (ACs, Fig. 2D), regulating the \n\ninformation from the interneurons to the RGCs. Teleosts possess around 40 types of ACs, many of \n\nthem with specific functions still unknown (Wagner et al., 1998; de Busserolles, 2013). Unlike \n\nfrom the other neuronal cells, RGCs (Fig. 2D) possesses axons composing the optic nerve, which \n\nare responsible to link the eyes to the brain, sending the electric signals with the perceived \n\nenvironment to the visual centres of the brain, where the electric impulses are interpreted as images \n\n(Wagner et al., 1998; Collin et al., 2000; Warrant &amp; Locket, 2004; de Busserolles, 2013). As the \n\nfish grows, the retinal growing is accompanied by an increase of RGCs number, but the densities \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ntend to decrease (Pankhurst, 1987; Collin &amp; Pettigrew, 1989). Different types of RGCs are \n\nspecialised for different characteristics of the perceived image (e.g. colour, movement, and contrast) \n\nand processed by different brain areas (Wagner et al., 1998; de Busserolles, 2013). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Schematic representation of myctophids retinal structure.

Cones are linked to acute and coloured \n\nvision, and rods to light sensitivity, as they are hundred times more sensitive to light than cones \n\n(Partridge et al., 1988; Lythgoe &amp; Partridge, 1989; Partridge et al., 1989; Yokoyama &amp; Yokoyama, \n\n1996; Douglas et al., 1998). Deep-sea fishes possess mostly pure-rod retinas (Fig. 2C) (Munk, \n\n1977; Cocker, 1978; Lythgoe &amp; Partridge, 1989). As rods detect a narrow interval of shortwaves \n\nthey are linked to scotopic (nocturnal) monochromatic vision (Pankhurst, 1987; Partridge et al., \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1989; Yokoyama &amp; Yokoyama, 1996; Warrant &amp; Locket, 2004; Johnsen, 2005). The diameter of \n\nrods\u2019 outer segments are intra- and interspecific variable (Partridge et al., 1988; Partridge et al., \n\n1989) and cell densities are constant or increase with fish age, as they have in situ origin from \n\nprecursor cells mitosis (Locket, 1980). Multiple banks are photoreceptors arranged in multilayers, \n\nwhich may increase as the fish grows and photoreceptors may cover totally the retinal surface with \n\nvisual pigment (Locket, 1980; Somiya, 1982).  \n\nThe photoreceptors\u2019 outer segments (Fig. 2B) include the visual pigments, transforming the \n\nenergy of the received photons into electrical signals (hyperpolarisation/transduction) and are \n\nresponsible for visual sensitivity - retinal pigment maximum wavelength (?max) absorption  \n\n(Douglas et al., 1995; Turner et al., 2009; de Busserolles, 2013). These pigments are proteins \u2013 \n\nopsins \u2013 covalently bonded to a light absorbing chromophore, derived from vitamin A (Bowmaker \n\net al., 1988; Yokoyama &amp; Yokoyama, 1996; Hope et al., 1997; Hasegawa et al., 2008; Toyama et \n\nal., 2008). Most deep-sea fishes present rhodopsin, a pigment derived from vitamin A1, but some \n\npossess a chromophore derived from vitamin A2 (porphyropsin), which is more sensitive to longer \n\nwavelengths (Lythgoe &amp; Partridge, 1989; Hasegawa et al., 2008; Toyama et al., 2008). Visual \n\npigment is \u201ctuned\u201d by opsin, a chromophore and its interactions (Yokoyama &amp; Yokoyama, 1996). \n\nSpectral information depends on the wavelengths of the photons reaching the photoreceptors and \n\nits retinal pigments (Denton et al., 1985; Bowmaker et al., 1988; Lythgoe &amp; Partridge, 1989; \n\nDouglas et al., 1998). Deep-sea fishes present mainly single pigmented rhodopsin retinas  as its \n\n?max (470 - 500 nm) matches mesopelagic shortwave spectra (Denton &amp; Warren, 1957; Lythgoe &amp; \n\nPartridge, 1989; Douglas et al., 1998; Warrant &amp; Locket, 2004). These shortwave pigments ?max \n\nare an adaptation to maximise signal, contrast and photon reception, and to reduce noise (Denton &amp; \n\nWarren, 1957; Lythgoe &amp; Partridge, 1989; Hope et al., 1997; Douglas et al., 1998).  The pattern of \n\namino acid residues of the opsin is responsible for the sensitivity of deep-sea fishes\u2019 rhodopsin to \n\nthe dim light environment (Crescitelli et al., 1985; Hope et al., 1997; Douglas et al., 1998). On the \n\nother hand, Douglas et al. (1998) and Owens et al. (2012) suggest that deep-sea fishes show ?max \n\nphylogenetic conservatism along with the effect of ecological pressures, for instance, myctophid \n\nspecies have similar ?max despite inhabiting diverse depths and not all performing DVMs. Even so, \n\nthese visual pigments and photoreceptors present in deep-sea fishes are an adaptation to light \n\navailability. Additionally, recent studies pointed to greater sensitivity to bioluminescence rather \n\nthan to the downwelling light (Douglas et al., 1995; Douglas et al., 1998; Turner et al., 2009). \n\nFish retinas grow through life, adding new cells at the periphery, and therefore forcing the older \n\ncells towards the central area, but, as RGCs density decreases, retinal area for each cell information \n\nshould increase with growth in order to keep a constant receptive field of constant visual angle \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(Collin &amp; Pettigrew, 1989). Retinal cells densities are not constant throughout the retina. In fact, \n\ncell topographic distributions reflect the animal\u2019s symmetry of the perceived environment (de \n\nBusserolles, 2013). The patterns of retinal cells reveal two main visual specializations (Fig. 3): area \n\nand horizontal streak (Collin &amp; Pettigrew, 1989; Collin et al., 2000; de Busserolles, 2013). The \n\narea reflects concentric increases of cell densities and is linked to visual acuity in enclosed \n\nenvironments (Collin &amp; Pettigrew, 1989; Collin et al., 2000; de Busserolles, 2013).  Horizontal \n\nstreaks represent elongated zones of high cell density, allowing a panoramic perception, more \n\ncommon in open water species (Collin &amp; Pettigrew, 1989; Collin et al., 2000; de Busserolles, \n\n2013). Many open water teleosts present both visual specializations, a temporal area centralis \n\nprobably used during feeding and a horizontal streak to detect intra- or interspecific movements \n\n(Collin &amp; Pettigrew, 1989; de Busserolles, 2013).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3 \u2013 RGCs topographic maps showing different visual specializations. A) Area centralis on coral cord \n\nCephalopholis miniatus; B) horizontal streak on small-spotted dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula. From de \n\nBusserolles (2013).  \n\n \n\nRGCs and PRs peak densities allow determining the visual sensitivity and acuity, defining light \n\nsensitivity and image quality, respectively. Peak cell densities can be as high as 7.4 x 10\n3\n cell/mm\n\n2\n \n\nin RGCs and to 119 x 10\n4\n cell/mm\n\n2\n  in PRs (Wagner et al., 1998; de Busserolles, 2013).  \n\nVisual acuity might be expressed as the spatial resolving power (SRP), calculated from the \n\npeaks of RGCs density (Collin &amp; Pettigrew, 1989; Ullmann et al, 2011; de Busserolles, 2013). SRP \n\nis determined by the number of cells subtended by one degree of visual arc, e.g., the visual angle \n\n(Collin &amp; Pettigrew, 1989; Ullmann et al., 2011; de Busserolles, 2013). An evolutionary relation \n\nbetween visual acuity and the animal\u2019s depth range can be expected, once acuity is limited by the \n\navailable light (Warrant &amp; Locket, 2004; McFall-Ngai et al, 1986; de Busserolles, 2013). In \n\nteleosts, visual acuity is also influenced by non-retinal characteristics of the eye, such as the pupil \n\ndiameter, which constrains the received light (Warrant &amp; Locket, 2004; de Busserolles, 2013; \n\nNillson et al., 2004). In fact, acuity is directly related to eye size and lens diameter (Pankhurst, \n\n1987; Collin &amp; Pettigrew, 1989; Douglas et al., 1998; de Busserolles, 2013). As stated, visual \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nsensitivity is more important to deep-sea fish than visual acuity. Sensitivity can be given by the \n\nlevel of PRs-RGCs convergence/summation ratio (Collin &amp; Pettigrew, 1989; Ullmann et al, 2011; \n\nde Busserolles, 2013). A high degree of PRs-RGCs convergence ratio is linked to high visual \n\nsensitivity and it increases with fish growth (7:1 to 300:1) (McNulty, 1976; Locket, 1980). \n\n \n\n1.2. Lanternfish vision \n\nMyctophids (or lanternfishes) are mesopelagic fishes belonging to the diverse family \n\nMyctophidae that includes about 250 species and 33 genera in two sub-families: Myctophinae and \n\nLampanyctinae (Moser et al., 1984; Catul et al., 2011). These fishes are characterized by high \n\nabundance populations and worldwide distribution, representing more than 20% of the oceanic \n\nicththyofauna and occupying upper and lower mesopelagic zones (Catul et al., 2011; Sutton, 2013). \n\nMyctophids\u2019 development occurs mainly in the epipelagic zone where they carry most activities \n\nsuch as feeding and reproduction (Catul et al., 2011). Myctophids are dioecious pelagic spawners \n\nand females are oviparous with low fecundity rate (Catul et al., 2011). Eggs and pre-\n\nmetamorphosis larvae are planktonic, and larvae are daytime feeders, contrary to mesopelagic post-\n\nmetamorphic individuals and adults (Moser &amp; Ahlstrom, 1972; Catul et al., 2011). Adult \n\nmyctophid\u2019s size range from 3 to 35 cm (Hulley, 1994), with lifespans of one year for tropical \n\nspecies and more than five years in temperate zones (Moser &amp; Ahlstrom, 1972).  \n\nLanternfishes are also a major component of the DVM aggregations of mesopelagic species. \n\nLanternfishes feed during the night, from dusk to dawn, following zooplankton DVM (Catul et al., \n\n2011; Vieira, 2011). They switch between day inactivity in the mesopelagic zone to night activity \n\nin the epipelagic zone where they feed on zooplankton, mainly copepods, euphasiids and \n\namphipods (Shreeve et al., 2009). Patterns in diel vertical movements depend on life stage, sex, \n\nlatitude, hydrography and season, and do not always involve the entire population (Catul et al., \n\n2011). Therefore, myctophids have an important role in biogeochemical fluxes, acting as a trophic \n\nlink between zooplankton and their predators (e.g., marine mammals, seabirds and cephalopods) \n\n(Trueman et al., 2014).  \n\nMyctophids possess ventrolateral photophores (Fig. 4) used for counterillumination, but also for \n\nintraspecific and, perhaps, interspecific communication (Moser &amp; Ahlstrom, 1972; Mensinger &amp; \n\nCase, 1997). Probably, for intraspecific communication, myctophids rely on species-specific \n\nphotophore emitting light patterns to communicate within a swimming school, individual \n\nidentification and even courtship signalling (Cocker, 1978; Turner et al., 2009; Haddock et al., \n\n2010). Some species present gender specific luminous caudal glands, either supracaudal (males) or \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ninfracaudal (females) (Salvanes &amp; Kristoffersen, 2001; Catul et al., 2011). Some myctophid species \n\npossess luminous organs, which are opaque patches of luminous tissue that differs structurally and \n\nin light signal from the photophores (Moser &amp; Ahlstrom, 1972; Barnes &amp; Case, 1974; Edwards &amp; \n\nHerring, 1977). These organs present a different physiological control and produce quicker and \n\nbrighter flashes than photophores (Barnes &amp; Case, 1974; Edwards &amp; Herring, 1977). Additionally, \n\nsome species show luminous patches on the head which produce bright flashes that may confuse \n\npredators and illuminate prey (e.g. Ceratoscopelus spp. and Diaphus spp.) (Barnes &amp; Case, 1974; \n\nEdwards &amp; Herring, 1977; Haddock et al. 2010). Head photophores or luminous patches enhance \n\nthe myctophids\u2019 visual acuity but may also expose them to predators (Cocker, 1978; Mensinger &amp; \n\nCase, 1997; Haddock et al., 2010; Catul et al., 2011). Some myctophid species might even be able \n\nto detect long wavelength light emitted by other deep-sea species (Turner et al., 2009; Haddock et \n\nal., 2010). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4 - Scheme of generic myctophid photophore pattern. From Moser et al. (1984). Acronyms for \n\nphotophore groups are presented. \n\nBesides the general vision characteristics shared by deep-sea fishes, most myctophids are \n\nmainly adapted to their bioluminescence ?Imax (469-474 nm), as there is a wide interval of \n\nwavelength from their prey or their predators to themselves (Partridge et al., 1988; Turner et al., \n\n2009). Light modulation is under neural control through physiological processes involving nitric \n\noxide; myctophids are able to control ventral photophores luminescence to almost instantly match \n\nthe downwelling light (Cocker, 1978; Young et al., 1979; Mensinger &amp; Case, 1997; Kr\u00f6nstr\u00f6m &amp; \n\nMallefet, 2010). As this wavelength match is not perfect, some predators may distinguish their \n\npreys\u2019 counter-illumination silhouette (Young et al., 1979; Johnsen et al., 2004; Turner et al., \n\n2009). \n\nThe majority of myctophids present retinas with single-pigment rhodopsin, ?max of 480-492 \n\nnm (Mensinger &amp; Case, 1997; Hasegawa et al., 2008). However, according to Mensinger &amp; Case \n\n(1997), Hasegawa et al. (2008) and de Busserolles (2013) there are a few double-pigmented with \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nrhodopsin/pophyropsin or two rhodopsins species, for instance in the genus Myctophum. Non-\n\npaired rhodopsin/porphyropsin may be an adaptation for detecting stomiid predators\u2019 red light \n\n(porphyropsine) and shorter-wave light (rhodopsin) (Mensinger &amp; Case, 1997; Hasegawa et al., \n\n2008). Hasegawa et al. (2008) also suggest the disparity of ?max between the two pigments may \n\nindicate not only larger spectral range but also colour vision for these deep-sea fishes. Two \n\nadditional retinal specializations are present in myctophids: a fundal pigmentation, probably a \n\nmodified pigment of epithelial cells of a visual specialization important at larval stages; and a \n\nphotostable yellow pigment, only found in species of the subfamily Myctophinae, which seems to \n\nbe used to enhance contrast and improve the detection of bioluminescent signals (de Busserolles, \n\n2013).  \n\n \n\n1.3. Aims and objectives \n\nThe main aim of this study is to contribute to the knowledge of how retinal organization can \n\nreflect the visual needs of myctophids in the mesopelagic zone. \n\nThe specific objectives are:  \n\n\u2022 to determine visual specializations of photoreceptors and retinal ganglion cells \n\n\u2022 to estimate visual acuity and sensitivity, particularly sensitivity to downwelling sunlight \n\nand sensitivity to bioluminescence by analysing the topography of photoreceptors, and \n\nretinal ganglion cell densities in adult myctophids of different species; \n\n\u2022 to interpret the data obtained in relation to morphometric, phylogenetic, environmental \n\nand behavioural data available for the myctophid species studied. \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\n2. Materials and methods \n\n2.1. Collection of specimens \n\nAdult myctophids were collected during the R/V Poseidon cruise P446 at Senghor Seamount \n\n(Fig. 5), which is located ca. 60 nm east to the Island of Sal, Cape Verde (Central Eastern Atlantic), \n\non February 2013. Six IKMT (Isaac-Kid Mid-Water Trawl) trawls were conducted between the \n\nsurface and 500 m depth from dusk to midnight. Immediately after recovery of the catch, fishes \n\nwere measured for total length (\u00b1 1 mm) and preserved in a seawater and 4% paraformaldehyde \n\nsolution, until identification and dissection. All the fishes were captured under the same conditions \n\nexcept Symbolophorus sp., which was found on the deck (Table I).  \n\n \n\nNote: This part of the study was not performed by the author. The collection of specimens was \n\ncarried out by  Rui Pedro Vieira. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5 \u2013 Bathymetric maps showing the sampling stations of R/V Poseidon cruise P446 at Senghor \n\nSeamount, next to Cape Verde archipelago.

The following morphometric parameters were \n\nmeasured using ImageJ 1.47V (Rasband, 1997-2014): 1. Total and Standard Lengths\n1\n (TL and SL, \n\nrespectively); 2. Rostrocaudal and Dorsoventral Eye Diameters (RC-ED and DV-ED, respectively); \n\n3. Lens Diameter (LD).  \n\nFishes eyes were enucleated and the retinas extracted and observed under light microscopy \n\n(100x objective for PRs and 40x for ACs/RGCs) for retinal wholemount analyses of PRs, ACs and \n\nRGCs (Appendix I). This procedure allows one to develop density topographic maps for these \n\nneural cells, and subsequently to identify visual specializations and density peaks of neural cells \n\n(Collin &amp; Pettigrew, 1989; Ullmann et al., 2011; de Busserolles, 2013). Horizontal scans of the \n\nretinas were performed to define sampling areas (SAs). Coordinates were registered for each SA \n\nand neural cells were counted to estimate cell densities. SAs coordinates allowed to create \n\ntopographic maps that incorporate cell density values from 200 selected SAs. Finally, a colour \n\ngradient was used to match the cell density value in order to represent the distribution of cell \n\n \n\n \n\n1\n Total length is measured to the tip of the tail while standard length is to the base of the tail (Hulley, 1989). \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\ndensities along the retina. Retinas were stained with Cresyl violet to distinguish RGCs and ACs. \n\nCell counts and production of retinal maps were done with ImageJ 1.47V and GIMP 2.8.10. The \n\nSchaffer Coefficient of Error (CE) was applied to ensure cell number estimation: \n\nCE=1/?Q, where Q represents the number of cells counted. \n\n \n\n2.3. Visual parameters estimations \n\nVisual parameters were estimated following Collin &amp; Pettigrew (1989), Ullmann et al. (2011) \n\nand de Busserolles (2013). Visual sensitivity was calculated from PRs-RGCs convergence, from \n\nthe peak densities of neural cells. Visual acuity, expressed as SRP, was calculated from the peaks \n\nof RGCs density. For SRP estimates, Matthiessen\u2019s ratio was used to calculate the distance from \n\nthe centre of a lens to the retina (posterior nodal distance, PND). Mattthiessen\u2019s ratio states that the \n\nfocal length in fishes is ?2,55 the radius of the lens:  \n\nPND = 2,55 x r, where r is the radius of the lens. \n\n \n\nThe angle (?) subtending 1 mm on the retina is given by: \n\ntan(?) = 1mm/PND. \n\n \n\nSRP is determined by the number of cells.mm\n-1\n\n subtended by 1 degree of visual arch: \n\nCells per degree = density at peak area/PND. \n\n \n\nTo distinguish the light-dark boundaries for 1 cycle of grating of the highest resolvable \n\nfrequency, at least 2 cells are needed: \n\nSRP (cycles per degree) = cells per degree/2. \n\n \n\nVisual sensitivities to downwelling light and bioluminescent point sources were estimated for  \n\nthe different specimens.. Sensitivity to downwelling light (S, extended light scene, expressed in \n\nmm\n-2\n\n.sr\n-2\n\n) was calculated by the following equation: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2\n  Steradian \u2013 SI Unit for solid angle (Warrant &amp; Locket, 2004). \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\nwhere d, k and l are the diameter, absorption coefficient and outer segment length of the PRs, \n\nrespectively. As k is fixed at 0.035 \u00b5m-1, which is the average value for vertebrates, and 1,275 \n\nrepresents a constant that relates the size of pupil and lens, in this equation, S is related to PRs \n\ndiameter and outer segments length (de Busserolles, 2013). The diameter, d, was measured in \n\nmedian density areas of PRs in the retina. The length l was obtained from de Busserolles (2013).  \n\nSensitivity to bioluminescent flashes (N, point source of light, in photons) is given by the \n\nfollowing formula: \n\n \n\n \n\nwhere E represents the number of photon emitted at the source, A is for the pupil diameter \n\n(meters), r is the distance (meters) between the light source and the eye, ? represents the \n\nattenuation coefficient of bioluminescence (combining the scattering and absorption of light by the \n\nwater molecules), and k, l are the absorption coefficient and outer segment length of the PRs, \n\nrespectively. As the pupil diameter was replaced by the lens diameter for A, as E was set at 10\n10\n\n \n\nphotons, r at 1m, ? at 0,05 m\n-1\n\n, and k at 0.035 \u00b5m-1, N is related to the lens\u2019 size and the outer \n\nsegment length of PRs (see Warrant &amp; Locket, 2004; and de Busserolles, 2013).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\n \n \n\n3. Results \n\n3.1.

Yellow \n\npigmented patches were not observed, and fundal pigmentation was not distinguishable in most of \n\nthe retinas analysed. No retinal tapeta were observed. \n\n \n\n3.1.1.

However, the streak specialization for H. taaningi is located through the nasal-ventral \n\nzone of the retina (Fig. 7E) showing a peak density of 692 x 10\n3\n cells.mm\n\n-2\n.

Discussion \n\n4.1. Topography of neural cells\u2019 density and visual parameters \n\n4.1.1. Photoreceptors \n\nAll the species analysed present pure-rod retina with high density of PRs, reflecting the known \n\nhigh visual sensitivity of myctophids\u2019 retinas (O\u2019Day &amp; Fernandez, 1976; Pankhurst, 1987; \n\nWagner et al., 1998; Sabat\u00e9s et al., 2003; de Busserolles, 2013). High visual sensitivity of \n\nmyctophids shows an adaptation to the dim and monochromatic light regimes characteristic of the \n\nmesopelagic zone (Douglas et al., 1995; Douglas et al., 1998; Turner et al., 2009). Additionally, \n\nthese fishes use bioluminescence for communication, feeding and reproduction (Cocker, 1978; \n\nMensinger &amp; Case, 1997; Turner et al., 2009; Haddock et al., 2010). Therefore, the perception of a \n\nfaint point of light is essential to their ecological success. \n\nDistribution patterns of rod densities reflect visual specializations, which can be associated to \n\nthe visual needs and behaviour of the fish (Collin &amp; Pettigrew, 1989; Collin et al., 2000; de \n\nBusserolles, 2013). The analysed myctophid species present different rod specializations. Rod \n\ndensities, given in Table II, differed within the same retina but also between species, suggesting \n\nspecies-specific visual needs (see Fig. 7). In the analysed species the position of the aphakic gap \n\nallows the projection of the light on the retinal zones with high PRs density, except in the species \n\npresenting streak-like PRs specialization. The aphakic gap allows \u201cextra\u201d light on the retina \n\n(Warrant &amp; Locket, 2004; de Busserolles, 2013), while photoreceptors function is to maximize the \n\nphoton catch (Yokoyama &amp; Yokoyama, 1996; Warrant &amp; Locket, 2004; Turner et al., 2009). \n\nConsequently, the retinal zones with higher photon incidence are also the more sensitive areas of \n\nthe retina, enhancing eye\u2019s photon catch. This concordance may depend upon the type of PRs \n\nspecialization, but the examination of a larger number of individuals is required to confirm the \n\nexception found in the species with a streak-like specialization of (e.g. Symbolophorus sp. and \n\nHygophum taaningi,) also observed by de Busserolles  (2013) in other myctophids. Diaphus holti \n\nand Lampadena sp. showed a dorsal-temporal arch, meaning that the incident light in this region \n\nhas origin in the lower frontal area of the fish visual field. This type of arch specializations may be \n\nused to detect bioluminescence sources from below (de Busserolles, 2013). Diaphus rafinesquii \n\nshows a nasal-ventral-temporal arch, capturing light from the upper frontal part of the fish\u2019s visual \n\nfield. This arrangement may be linked to enable the ability to distinguish predators or prey \n\nsilhouettes against the background (de Busserolles, 2013). The distinction of upper silhouettes may \n\nalso be assigned to the ventral streak-like specialized retinas in Symbolophorus sp. and H. taaningi. \n\nRing specializations observed in Lepidophanes guentheri and Ceratoscopelus warmingii might be \n\nrelated to the light projected by the circumlental aphakic gap (see Fig 7). The peak density of rods \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\nin the temporal-ventral zone of C. warmingii retina suggests this region has an important role \n\nreceiving the light coming from the upper front of the fish.  \n\nThe circumlental aphakic gap allows an increased visual field in every direction. PRs ring \n\nspecializations are present in visual generalists or fishes that do not rely much in vision as an \n\nimportant sensorial system (de Busserolles, 2014). Most likely, L. guentheri and C. warmingii are \n\nvisual generalists, once they have several visual stimuli from different directions. Myctophids are \n\nable to produce bioluminescent light, but are also subjected to great light gradients. Therefore, they \n\nseem to rely strongly on vision to succeed in such environment (Young et al., 1979; Partridge et al., \n\n1988; Johnsen et al., 2004; Turner et al., 2009), namely by using it to avoid predators and forage \n\npreys (Catul et al., 2011: Murphy et al., 2007; Shreeve et al., 2009). \n\n \n\n4.1.2. Amacrine cells and retinal ganglion cells \n\nMyctophid neural cells densities here estimated are higher than those obtained by de Busserolles \n\n(2013). This might be explained as an observations bias, but also due to the degradation of the \n\nretinas and some handling procedures (see Appendix II).  \n\nACs and RGCs densities do not seem to vary much across the retina or between species (see \n\nTable III). According to several authors (Collin &amp; Pettigrew, 1989; Wagner et al., 1998; Warrant &amp; \n\nLocket, 2004) this is an indication of low visual acuity. Considering that mesopelagic depths are \n\ncharacterized by dim and monochromatic light, acuity is not crucial to the animals that inhabit this \n\noceanic zone (Pankhurst, 1987; Warrant &amp; Locket, 2004; de Busserolles, 2013). Under these light \n\nregimes the detection of a faint light signal (sensitivity) may be far more important for mesopelagic \n\nfishes than perceiving images with great definition (acuity). \n\nACs and RGCs density estimates were always higher in the retinal periphery and the \n\ntopography of these two types of neurons revealed some similarities (see Fig. 9). Both types of \n\nneural cells show similar distributions (Collin &amp; Pettigrew, 1989). However, ACs functions are still \n\nnot well understood, and the inclusion of these neural cells in SRP calculations may led to an \n\noverestimation of acuity (Wagner et al., 1998; de Busserolles, 2013). Additionally, since RGCs \n\nrepresent the gateway of visual information to the brain (Wagner et al., 1998; Warrant &amp; Locket, \n\n2004), only this cell type will be discussed below.  \n\nEven if RGCs densities showed little variation across the retina in the analysed species, area \n\nspecializations are present, and this indicates that visual acuity is important for these fishes\u2019 visual \n\ncapabilities (Collin &amp; Pettigrew, 1989; Wagner et al., 1998; Collin et al., 2000; de Busserolles, \n\n2013).  Although less precisely than for PRs, aphakic gaps are also coincident with the RGCs peak \n\ndensity zones. The exceptions are the PRs streak specialized retinas of Symbolophorus sp. and H. \n\ntaaningi. These two species also differ in their relative (spatial) alignment of the PRs and RGCs \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\ndensity peaks. As the light emitted by counterillumination presents a wavelength range similar to \n\nthe downwelling light (Partridge et al., 1989; Turner et al., 2009; Haddock et al., 2010) and \n\nmyctophids communicate with light patterns (Moser &amp; Ahlstrom, 1972; Moser et al., 1984; \n\nMensinger &amp; Case, 1997; Catul et al., 2011), some acuity is needed to distinct the silhouette of a \n\nconspecific from a predator or a prey (Cocker, 1978; Yokoyama &amp; Yokoyama, 1996; Johnsen et al., \n\n2004; Turner et al., 2009). This PRs and RGCs alignment may allow a better silhouette distinction \n\nagainst the downwelling background light (de Busserolles, 2013), as stated before for the ventral \n\narch specialization of PRs in D. rafinesquii. The correspondence of PRs and RGCs peak densities \n\nwith the aphakic gaps corroborates that visual acuity may also be important for these fishes.  \n\nThe analysed species presented areae (see Fig. 9), which may reflect similar visual needs for \n\nacuity. Exceptions are Symbolophorus sp. and L. guentheri which do not present any clear RGCs \n\nspecialization which might be linked to an improved visual sensitivity (de Busserolles, 2013). \n\nHowever, these conclusions should be taken carefully, because RGCs specializations were \n\npreviously observed in Symbolophorus species (de Busserolles, 2013). Differences in the present \n\nstudy and results obtained by de Busserolles (2013) might be explained by the degradation of \n\nretinas or methodological issues here. Diaphus holti, D. rafinesquii, Lampadena sp. and H. \n\ntaaningi present areae temporales reflecting an enhanced acuity in relation to the front visual field \n\nof the animal. This may probably facilitate the binocular vision for predation or adaptation to a \n\nstructurally complex habitat (de Busserolles, 2013), which are ecological traits of myctophids, as \n\npreviously stated. Hygophum taaningi seems to show also an area in the nasal part of the retina that, \n\nsimilar to C. warmingii area in the ventral-nasal zone of the retinas but no similar observation was \n\nfound in the available literature. Eye misorientation might have occurred during the RGCs analysis \n\nof C.warmingii retina, since de Busserolles (2013) observed an area ventro-temporalis for the same \n\nspecies. Nevertheless, the presence of a ventral areae in the retina of C. warmingii, suggests \n\nenhanced acuity in relation to the upper part of the visual field, used for distinction of silhouettes \n\nabove the fish. The case of H. taaningi will be addressed later. \n\n \n\n4.1.3. Visual acuity and sensitivity \n\nInvestigation of the retinas of the seven myctophid species in this study revealed that visual \n\nsensitivity was higher for Symbolophorus sp. and Lampadena sp (see Table IV). Both species \n\npresented higher rod peak density and PRs-RGCs convergence, when compared to the other \n\nmyctophids. Diaphus holti and H. taaningi presented lower values of visual sensitivity. Hygophum \n\ntaaningi also showed lower rod peaks density, but that was not found in D. holti. Visual acuity is \n\ncalculated using the lens size. This seems to influence and explain the acuity values, as these are \n\nhigher for Symbolophorus sp. and Lampadena sp which present the larger lenses (Table V), and \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\nlower for L. guentheri with the smaller lens. As referred above, Symbolophorus sp. and L. \n\nguentheri do not present any clear RGCs specialization, which may be linked to increased visual \n\nsensitivity. In fact, this may be corroborated by the fact that both species present higher visual \n\nsensitivity than acuity, when compared to the other analysed species (Fig. 10).   \n\n Sensitivity to downwelling light (S) is linked to higher diameter of PRs, while sensitivity to \n\nbioluminescent light (N) to bigger eyes (see Materials and Methods). PRs diameter are higher for C. \n\nwarmingii (d = 1,00 \u00b5 m) and H. taaningi  (d = 1,04 \u00b5m) and lower for D. holti  and D. rafinesquii \n\n(d = 0,73 and 0,76 \u00b5 m, respectively), corresponding to the higher S values for C. warmingii and H. \n\ntaaningi  and  lower for Diaphus holti.  As N is linked to the size of the eye and the lens, the values \n\nfor N have the same explanation as referred above for visual acuity.  Apart from Diaphus holti \n\nwhich present the lower values for S and N (Fig. 11), the analysed species seem to be more \n\nsensitive to downwelling light (H. taaningi and C. warmingii) or to bioluminescent flashes \n\n(Symbolophorus sp. and Lampadena sp.). These results corroborates the early suggestions that \n\nLampadena sp. PRs arch specialization may be used to perceive bioluminescent flashes and the \n\nring of C. warmingii for perception of silhouettes against the downwelling light background. Low \n\nvalues of visual sensitivity (including S and N) and high visual acuity estimated for Diaphus holti \n\nsuggests it may rely less on sensitivity to light.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 10 \u2013 Dot plot showing the values of visual acuity (SRP, in cycles per degree) and sensitivity (PRs-\n\nRGCs convergence). \n\n \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 11 \u2013 Dot plot showing the values of sensitivity to downwelling light (S, in \u00b5 m\n2\n.sr) and to \n\nbioluminescence (N, in photons). \n\n \n\nAs stated before, aphakic gaps do not coincide with RGCs or PRs peak densities for the PRs \n\nstreak specialized retinas of Symbolophorus sp. and H. taaningi. Also RGCs peak densities do not \n\ncorrespond to PRs ones for these two species. Symbolophorus sp. is more sensitive to \n\nbioluminescence but no clear RGCs specialization (see Fig. 9), so the acuity does not seem \n\nimportant. This corroborates the early suggestion that Symbolophorus sp. uses the ventral aphakic \n\ngap to detect bioluminescent signals from below. On the other hand, H. taaningi is more sensitive \n\nto downwelling light and present RGCs specialization, so the acuity seems to have more \n\nimportance for this species, essentially at the front horizontal axis. Hygophum taaningi seems to be \n\nbetter adapted to distinct silhouettes against the downwelling light background on the upper frontal \n\nvisual field. However, because of the low number of samples this interpretation must be taken with \n\ncaution.  \n\nThese results show that visual acuity is relatively low (SRP from 2.58 to 5.13) and sensitivity is \n\nhigh (PRs-RGCs convergence from 31:1 to 73:1) when compared to other deep-sea fish families \n\n(e.g. Argyropelecus sladeni, SRP = 12:1 and convergence = 8.4; Alepocephalus bairdii, SRP = 22.9; \n\nScopelarchus michaelsarsi, convergence = 29:1, from Wagner et al., 1998). One could expect that \n\nthese observations are due to patterns in mesopelagic light regimes, as already explained above. \n\nEstimated visual sensitivity is low when compared to other myctophids of the same genera in de \n\nBusserolles (2013), but acuity showed higher values. Additionally, estimates of sensitivity to \n\ndownwelling light are lower, while estimates of sensitivity to bioluminescent light are higher, when \n\ncompared with the values obtained by de Busserolles (2013). These values divergences may be \n\nrelated with observation bias and methodological issues (see Appendix II). \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\n4.2. Vision and natural history traits in myctophids \n\n4.2.1. Morphology \n\nEye size is linked to visual parameters, as explained above for SRP and N.  Species with larger \n\neyes (Symbolophorus sp. and Lampadena sp.) present higher visual sensitivity (see Table V), \n\nprobably because the area of retinal tissue is larger and thus contains more rods. Luminous patches \n\nand sexual dimorphism do not seem to relate with any retinal characteristics analysed in this study, \n\nbut a larger sample size is needed to explain these results. de Busserolles (2013) states that \n\nmyctophids with no luminous patches and with deeper distribution profiles possess higher \n\nsensitivity to downwelling light and species with sexual dimorphism possess higher sensitivity \n\n(higher rod densities). \n\n \n\n4.2.2. Depth range and diel vertical migration \n\nInformation on depth ranges was retrieved from Hulley (1989) and vertical migration data is \n\ngiven by Watanabe et al (1999). Since it was not possible to identify the specimens of \n\nSymbolophorus and Lampadena to species level, their depth distribution was inferred from the \n\navailable data on the species of the respective genera present in Cape Verde waters, e.g. \n\nSymbolophorus veranyi and Lampadena urophaos. In fact, species depth ranges do not vary greatly \n\nwithin Symbolophorus and Lampadena genera (Hulley, 1989). The available information on depth \n\ndistribution was used to infer, DVM patterns for species that were not analysed in Watanabe et al., \n\n(1999). Because all the analysed specimens were adults, only the data on adults was used.  \n\nVisual parameters \u2013 sensitivity and acuity - appear to be not related with DVM patterns or \n\ndistances covered by these species, but this was not the case for the PRs specializations. Species \n\nwith arch specializations are Non-migrators (D. rafinesquii) and mid-water migrators (D. holti and \n\nLampadena sp.). The fact that D. rafinesquii inhabits only the upper mesopelagic zone, where \n\ndownwelling light is the main source of light (Wagner et al., 1998; Warrant &amp; Locket, 2004; Yakir \n\net al., 2013), is in agreement with the occurrence of a ventral arch specialization to capture light \n\nfrom above and favouring  silhouette distinction. Results also suggest that Diaphus species might \n\nrely less on sensitivity, which can be related with an upper mesopelagic habitat, where \n\ndownwelling is the main light source (Wagner et al., 1998; Warrant &amp; Locket, 2004; Yakir et al., \n\n2013). The low DVM distances of D. holti and Lampadena sp. may explain the retinal \n\nspecialization found in these species. Arches focus a specific part of the visual field (de Busserolles, \n\n2013), and their specializations in the dorsal region of retinas can detect bioluminescent light from \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\nbelow. Lampadena sp. presents higher sensitivity to bioluminescent flashes than D. holti which \n\nmay be linked to the fact that Lampadena sp. inhabits both upper and lower mesopelagic (Fig. 12).  \n\nStreak-like specializations were found in surface-migrators (Symbolophorus sp. and H. \n\ntaaningi). Their rod specializations capture light from above allowing these species to distinguish \n\nsilhouettes against the downwelling light (Wagner et al., 1998; Warrant &amp; Locket, 2004; Yakir et \n\nal., 2013). However, Symbolophorus sp. seems to be more sensitive to bioluminescent flashes than \n\nH. taaningi.  \n\nMid-water migrators L. guentheri and C. warmingii (Fig. 12) showed ring specializations, \n\nwhich were found in visual generalist species (de Busserolles, 2013). This is probably related to the \n\nfact that these species are able to perform long vertical migrations and, consequently, are exposed \n\nto more dynamic light scenarios. The temporal-ventral peak density of rods in C. warmingii\u2019s ring \n\nmaybe used to further recognise silhouettes from above the fish.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 12 \u2013 Diagram showing DVM patterns and respective depths for the analysed species. Grey bars \n\nrepresent daytime depth distributions and black bars night-time depth. Depth data from Hulley (1989) and \n\nDVM data from Watanabe et al. (1999). \n\n \n\n4.2.3. Phylogenetic relations \n\nde Busserolles (2013) observed a phylogenetic relationship on RGCs specializations, but the \n\nsample size and the number of taxa used in the present study cannot be used to confirm such \n\npatterns.  Nevertheless, the data presented here suggests that PRs specializations are interspecific. \n\nStreak-like specialized retinas only occured in species of the Myctophinae sub-family \n\n(Symbolophorus sp. and H. taaningi) while arches and rings only occurred in species of the \n\nLampanyctinae sub-family (D. holti, D. rafinesquii, Lampadena sp., L. guentheri and C. \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\nwarmingii). In the same way, ring specializations were found in Ceratoscopelus warmingii and \n\nLepidophanes guentheri which accord to Moser et al. (1984) are phylogenetically close. This \n\nshows that besides ecological parameters, such as biotic interactions, depth distributions, DVM \n\npatterns and light regimes, myctophids vision can also be phylogenetically constrained but once \n\nagain, the data presented here must be analysed carefully, since this study only includes one \n\nindividual in each of seven myctophid species. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5. Conclusion  \n\nAll the analysed myctophid species revealed high visual sensitivity and low acuity, showing a \n\nvisual adaptation to the mesopelagic dim and monochromatic light. Higher density and variations \n\nin rods than for RGCs support the fact that myctophids rely more on visual sensitivity than acuity. \n\nEven if some parameters do not vary much between species, some of them (Symbolophorus sp. and \n\nLampadena sp.) seem to be more specialized for sensitivity to bioluminescence, while other (H. \n\ntaaningi and C. warmingii) to the downwelling sunlight. This indicates that species are well \n\nadapted to these two types of light sources, which characterize the mesopelagic zone. The existence \n\nof different visual specializations for PRs and RGCs of the myctophids\u2019 retinas indicates that these \n\nfishes rely on vision for different ecological tasks.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Eye orientation and enucleation \n\n1. Before enucleation external characteristics\n3\n of the eye were annotated, and a digital \n\nphotograph taken (Fig. 1). Photographs were taken to ensure the correct eye orientation. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 \u2013Lepidophanes guentheri showing the left eye before enucleation.  \n\n \n\n2. While holding the fish head with the fine forceps, the eye was gently rotated forward and \n\nthe conjunctiva (Fig. 2) cut with a microknife.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Diagram of eyeball anatomy, showing the conjunctiva. Adapted from De Busserolles, 2013. \n\n \n\n3. The eyeball was gently pulled out from the orbit and the adipose and muscle tissues cut, \n\nwith mini-scissor. The optical nerve was gently cut, leaving a small portion of it. \n\n \n\n \n3\n Mainly, differences in pigmentation of the iris and aphakic gap. \n\n\n\n4. Digital photographs of the enucleated eye were taken and eye dimensions measurement \n\n(Fig. 3). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Enucleated left eye of Lepidophanes guentheri showing the dorsoventral and rostrocaudal eye \n\ndiameters. The white arrow points the dorsal orientation of the eye. \n\n \n\nII. Opening the eye and cornea and lens extraction \n\n1. The eye was placed with the cornea side up. With fine forceps, the cornea was gently hold \n\nto show a small fold, in order to easily be cut with mini-scissors.  \n\n2. The cornea was cut along the edge with mini-scissors, slowly to avoid damaging the iris, \n\nonce its pigmentation is the main orientation reference. Lens was gently pulled out from \n\nthe orbit and the lens muscles cut with miniforceps \n\n3. Digital photographs of the lens were taken to measure the diameter of the lens (Fig. 4). \n\nThen, the lens was kept in PBS buffer. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Lens diameter measured from a digital photograph of a lens extracted from Lepidophanes \n\nguentheri. \n\n\n\nIII. Retinal fixation\n4\n \n\n1. The entire eyecup was submerged in paraformaldehyde with phosphate buffer for 60-120 \n\nminutes. Fixation solution should be 5 times the eyecup volume, at least. When \n\nmanoeuvring the eyecup, special care was taken to hold it from the remaining muscles or \n\noptic nerve, with fine forceps.  \n\n2. The eyecup was removed from the fixation solution and washed in PBS, for approximately \n\n1 minute.  \n\n \n\nIV. Retinal extraction \n\n1. The eyecup was placed in a Petri dish with chilled PBS under the dissection microscope. \n\n2. Using fine forceps and mini-scissors, the iris was gently cut along the edge, with the \n\nexception of the dorsal part, for orientation purposes.  \n\n3. The vitreous humour (and some cornea and iris remains, eventually) was gently pulled with \n\nfine forceps and cut with the mini-scissors. As this is a transparent tissue and it is located \n\nnear the retina, it was not entirely removed, to avoid to damaging the retina.  \n\n4. For orientation purposes, with the mini-scissors. the dorsal position of the retina was gently \n\nmarked, with a deep radial cut, about 2/3 of its radius, with care to do not cut near the optic \n\nnerve. This cut helps to open the sclera. \n\n5. The eyeball was turned with the dorsal side up, to facilitate the access to the scleral cut \n\nmade right before.  \n\n6. The sclera was cut all around, perpendicularly to the radial cut. The cut has to be done \n\nreally gently, since the scissors can get in contact with the retina, damaging it. As the cut \n\ngoes through, the sclera and choroidal tissue detach from the retina by itself, so the \n\ndetached tissue can be gently cut and removed. \n\n7. Sclera was removed with care to avoid damaging the retina. \n\n8. Using a paintbrush, the remaining choroid and retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) were \n\nremoved. When small portions of the RPE were hard to detach from the retinal periphery, \n\nit was not removed to avoid damaging the retina. \n\n9. The remaining optic nerve was gently removed and a digital photograph was taken (Fig. \n\n5A). \n\n \n\n \n4\n For teleosts, Ullmann et al. (2011) and De Busserolles, (2013) recommend retinal fixation prior to removal \n\n\n\n10. Finally, with the mini-scissors, 3-4 clean radial cuts about 2/3 of the retinal radius diameter \n\nwere done, to allow the retina to be flattened without ripping it. A digital photograph was \n\ntaken (Fig. 5B). The radial cuts can be done only when placed the retina on the slide, since \n\nthe retina is more fragile with the cuts \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5 \u2013 Extracted retina from the left eye of Lepidophanes guentheri, showing A) pre- and B) post radial \n\ncuts. Arrows indicates the dorsal side of the eye. \n\n \n\nV. Cover slips and slides preparation \n\nWhen possible, new cover slips were used, when recycled slides were used, they were cleaned with \n\nethanol 96%. \n\nFor RGCs mountings, gelatinized slides are required. For this purpose, cover one side of the \n\nslide with Gatenby\u2019s solution 2 or 3 times. To ensure the slides were dry between coatings, they \n\nwere placed into an oven at 37\u00baC. After the last coating, gelatinized slides were kept at the oven for \n\nminimum 8 hours. \n\nTo avoid any damage to the retina while examining it, a spacer was created from paper strips \n\nand nail varnish, as glue. As the spacer should be slightly thicker than the retina, two paper layers \n\nwere used (Fig. 6). This technique was only used for RGCs permanent mounting, since PRs \n\nmountings were temporary, only a few quantity of glue was used between the edges of the slide and \n\ncover slip. Also, with dry glue it is easy to take off the cover slip without brake it, avoiding glass \n\nfragments on the retina\u2019s surface. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6 \u2013 Scheme of the RGCs mounting showing the spacer and the retina inside. Red lines represent the \n\nlayers of nail varnish and the arrows point to the two paper strips layers (white bands) in it. Dashed lines \n\nrepresent the retina inside the mounting.   \n\n \n\nVI. Retinal wholemounting  \n\nSince RGCs mounting involve gelatinized slides and staining procedures, for visualization of the \n\nneural cells on the same retina, PRs were examined before. For PRs observation, the scleral side of \n\nthe retina has to be upwards, while for RGCs must be observed the vitreal side. \n\nThe extracted retina was floated onto a non-gelatinized slide. This step presented more \n\ndifficulties, because the retina can be easily damaged. In order to facilitate the transferring process, \n\nthe Petri dish used for retinal extraction was filled with PBS, the slide was placed in it, and the \n\nretina was gently carried to the centre of the slide, scleral side up. Then, the slide was taken from \n\nthe PBS and the buffer excess absorbed with a paper towel, with care to avoid touching the retina. \n\nA paintbrush was used to help flatten the retina, avoiding folds. \n\n \n\nVII. Retinal cell visualization \n\nVII.1. Photoreceptors \n\n1. One or two drops of glycerol were placed onto the mounted retina (Fig. 7) in order to \n\nobtain a 50/50 glycerol/buffer.  \n\n2. PRs were observed under the 100x objective of an optical microscope (Fig. 8). A digital \n\nphotograph of the mounted retina was taken after the observation of PRs. Because the \n\nretinas may be squashed and suffer small rips during the observation under the 100x \n\nobjective, a post-observation photograph ensures a more accurate map. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 7 \u2013 Digital photographs of PRs\u2019 mountings from myctophids.

Arrow indicates the dorsal side \n\nof the eye. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8 \u2013 Digital photograph of PRs from a myctophid retina, observed under 100x objective of an optical \n\nmicroscope. \n\n \n\nVII.2. Retinal ganglion cells \n\n1. Using a scalpel, some pressure was gently made onto the glue to detach the cover slip from \n\nthe slide. Once the cover slip was removed, the slide was gently scraped with a scalpel and \n\ncleaned with paper towel, to remove the remaining glue.  \n\n2. Some drops of PBS were placed on the retina to remove the glycerol. \n\n3. The retina was placed on a freshly gelatinized slide, with the vitreal side facing up. For this \n\npurpose, the gelatinized slide was placed on the retina and a small pressure was gently \n\napplied. Then, the slides were turned upside-down and the non-gelatinized slide was slowly \n\npulled up, in order to detach the retina without fragmenting the tissue. With the scleral side \n\nfacing up, for PRs observation, this step places it directly with the vitreal side up, ready for \n\nthe RGCs observation. A paintbrush was used to gently flatten the retina on the gelatinized \n\nslide, to avoid folds, and photographs were taken (Fig. 9A). \n\n\n\n4. In order to dry the retina on the gelatinized slide, it was placed horizontally, on a moist \n\npaper towel inside a Petri dish in the desiccator. The desiccator lid was first placed with \n\njust a little gap to avoid condensation, and it was gently opened every 3 or 4 days until the \n\nretina present a dry aspect (Fig. 9B).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9 \u2013 Digital photographs of the left retina of a Lepidophanes guentheri. A) Before drying; and B) after \n\ndrying. Arrow indicates the dorsal side of the eye. \n\n \n\n5. The retina was stained with 0,1% Cresyl violet, following procedure in Table I: \n\n \n\nTable I \u2013 Procedure for 0,1 Cresyl violet staining. Adapted from Ullmann et al. (2011). \n\nStage Staining tray Time Purpose \n\n1 Histoclear 15 min clearing agent \n\n2 100% ethanol 3 min defatting \n\n3 90% ethanol 2 min rehydration \n\n4 70% ethanol 2 min rehydration \n\n5 20% ethanol 1 min rehydration \n\n6 Distilled water 2 min rehydration \n\n7 0,1% Cresyl violet  20 min staining \n\n8 Distilled water quick rinse rehydration \n\n9 20% ethanol 30 s rehydration \n\n10 70% ethanol 30 s rehydration \n\n11 90% ethanol 30 s rehydration \n\n12 Differentiation solution 1 min differentiation \n\n13 100% ethanol 1,5 min dehydration \n\n14 Histoclear 3 min clearing agent \n\n \n\n6. The staining solution excess was removed with paper towel, and the slide placed on paper \n\ntowel for, at least, 30 minutes, to ensure the remaining histoclear drying.  \n\n\n\n7. The mounting for RGCs (Fig. 10A) was done as explained in the Section V. The nail \n\nvarnish was dry from layer to layer of the spacer and before the mounting media \n\napplication. For this purpose, only one drop of glycerol was placed on the retina. Then, nail \n\nvarnish was gently applied on the spacer, allowing it to glue the cover slip. Finally, the \n\ncover slip was slowly placed on the spacer (Fig. 10B). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 10 - Digital photographs of RGCs\u2019 mountings. A) Full view of a Diaphus holti. mounting; B) Close \n\nlook of a mounted retina from Lepidophanes guentheri. Arrow indicates the dorsal side of the eye. \n\n \n\n8. The retina was observed under the 40x objective of an optical microscope, to avoid the \n\nretina to get squashed and ripped during the observation.  \n\n \n\nVIII. Mapping retinal cell distributions  \n\nVIII.1. Photoreceptors \n\n1. Coordinates of the vertical and horizontal edges were annotated and a value was defined \n\nfor the distance between sampling areas (SAs), in order to obtain more than 200\n5\n SAs in \n\nany single retina. \n\n2. The retinas was then scanned from the top to the bottom by horizontal transects and from \n\nleft to right side in each SA. Horizontal and vertical coordinates were taken for each \n\ntransect and for each SA, respectively. Transects were labelled by a capital letter (in \n\nalphabetic order from the top to the bottom) and the SAs by numbers for each transects. \n\n3. Digital photographs were taken for each SA.Several photographs were taken per SA in \n\norder to focus different parts of the analysed area, as the retina present an irregular surface \n\nwhen mounted. \n\n \n\n \n5\n Value stablished by Ullmann et al. (2011) and de Busserolles, (2013). \n\n\n\n \n\nVIII.2. Retinal ganglion cells \n\nContrary to PRs, RGCs are distinguishable with the 40x objective, so this objective was used for \n\nthese neural cells\u2019 observation. Nevertheless, the procedure for RGCs mapping, was similar to the \n\nPRs. Since the amplification used was lower for RGCs than PRs and the total SAs number rarely \n\napproached 200, the entire retinas was scanned. \n\n \n\nIX. Topographic map\n6\n \n\n1. Digital photographs of the retinas mountings were used to create the topographic maps (Fig. \n\n11A). \n\n2. Vertical and horizontal grids were added to the image and aligned with the respective axis \n\nedges of the outline. \n\n3. To create a preliminary map, 150 SAs were evenly selected and labelled in the image, \n\naligned to the horizontal grid within each transect, and aligned with the vertical grid by \n\ntransect (Fig 11B). \n\n4. The cells counting procedure was the same for PRs and RGCs, but for RGCs, ACs were \n\nsimultaneously counted. One photograph per previously selected SA was chosen and a 100 \n\n\u00b5 m\n2\n grid applied. Five grid squares were chosen as counting replicates, from which a final \n\naverage was calculated to represent the cell density for each selected SA (cells/100 \u00b5 m\n2\n).  \n\n5. The cell densities for the selected SAs calculated in the step above replaced the respective \n\nSAs labels on the map (Fig. 11C). \n\n6. The cell densities were replaced by a numeric scale (Fig. 11D) that corresponds to the \n\ncolour gradient of the topographic map (Fig. 11E).  \n\n7. The layout obtained represents a preliminary map, as stated in (5). For the final map, 50 \n\nnon-selected SAs were included within the high density zones of the preliminary map. This \n\naimed to achieve a greater definition by subsampling higher cell density areas of the retina. \n\n8. The final topographic map (Fig. 11F) should include: 1. retinal outline; 2. iso-density lines \n\nor colour gradation; 3. natural landmarks; 4. retinal orientation; and 5. scale bar.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n6\n For steps (e) (h) (i), ImageJ 1.47V was used. The rest was developed with GIMP 2.8.10. \n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 11 \u2013 Scheme representing the procedure of density topographic mapping for Hygophum taaningi.

Methodological issues \n\n \n\nThe wholemounting technique protocol used in this study was primarily based on Ullmann et al. \n\n(2011), who presented a general procedure for vertebrates. The observation of other retinas from \n\ndifferent fish species (not included in this study) revealed that myctophids possess a singular retina, \n\nand allowed a subsequent optimization of the protocol. In this way, some factors varied between \n\nretinal treatments for different specimens (Table I). For future observations, the transition of the \n\nretinas from the PRs mounting slide to the gelatinized one should be done by floating the retinas in \n\nPBS instead of turning slides upside-down (see Appendix I), in order to avoid a possible \n\ndisplacement of the retinas. Another further improvement should be the use of a permanent \n\nmounting media instead of glycerol, since this solution clears the neural cells, making them harder \n\nto distinguish within a month from the mounting process. The stress caused by the fishing or the \n\npost-mortem condition of the retinae might contribute to the difficulties found during the analysis. \n\nAdditionally, fishes with smaller eyes possess smaller neural cells, and more difficult to distinguish. \n\nSome methodological implications seem to be related with the difficulty to analyse the neural cells: \n\n1) the specimens were already fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (see Material and methods, page 14) \n\nwhen retinas were collected. In the laboratory, an additional retinal fixation was done (see \n\nAppendix I, section III), which could have contributed to the brighter neural cells, making it \n\ndifficult to distinguish; 2) a spacer should have been used to observe PRs, in order to avoid cells to \n\nsquash, which makes it harder to identify these neurons; 3) retinas were not washed and incubated \n\nwith PBS after PRs observations to remove all the remaining glue from the mountings, probably, \n\naffecting the staining conditions and, consequently, making RGCs difficult to distinguish.   \n\nDamaged retinas (see Results) seem to limit the analyses of neural cells, because RGCs \n\nspecializations were not always easy to distinguish (Fig. 1), which could have cause miscounting in \n\nsome retinas (e.g. Symbolophorus sp. and Lepidophanes guentheri). However, the reason for the \n\nneglected condition does not seem to be related with sampling, maintenance or methodology. \n\nUllmann et al. (2011) suggested that the number of cells in the retinal periphery may lead to an \n\noverestimation, due to the relatively thin retinal periphery and the radial cuts and shrinkage of the \n\nretina while treated for RGCs observation. As observed by Collin &amp; Pettigrew (1989), difficulty in \n\ndistinguish ACs from RGCs might be a problem, and it could lead to an overestimation of RGCs.  \n\nMoreover, due to problems already mentioned, most retinas were damaged, which made \n\ndifficult to identify and count RGCs, contributing to differences in results. The results obtained in \n\nthis study differ from those obtained by de Busserolles (2013), most probably due to an observation \n\nbias that led to the overestimation of cells density values, especially for RGCs.  \n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Photographs of degraded and non-degraded retinas, showing the distinguishability of neural cells. \n\nA) PRs photographed under a 100x objective from a degraded retinas of L. guentheri; B) PRs photographed \n\nunder a 100x objective from a non-degraded retinas of C. warmingii; C) ACs and RGCs photographed under \n\na 40x objective from a degraded retinas of L. guentheri; D) ACs and RGCs photographed under a 40x \n\nobjective from a degraded retinas of C. warmingii.
