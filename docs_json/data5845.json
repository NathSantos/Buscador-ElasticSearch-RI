The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) plays a \n\nfundamental role in the oceanography and climate of the Atlantic realm, directly controlling \n\nstratification and distribution of water masses, the amount of heat that is transported by the \n\nocean, and the cycling and storage of chemical species, such as carbon dioxide in the deep \n\nsea. The formation and circulation of Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) is an important \n\ncomponent of the upper branch of the AMOC, involved in the transport of heat and salt within \n\nthe Southern Hemisphere subtropical gyre and driving high\u2013low latitude climatic \n\nteleconnections. Reconstructing intermediate water properties is, therefore, important for \n\nunderstanding feedbacks within the ocean-climate system. However, information on AAIW \n\nevolution remains limited. AMOC oscillations and changes in heat distribution have strong \n\nimplications for the South American climate, influencing moisture influx availability for the \n\nSouth American Summer Monsoon (SASM), via sea surface temperatures and Intertropical \n\nConvergence Zone positioning. Here we reconstruct AAIW isotopic signature during marine \n\nisotope stages 2 and 3 (41-12 cal kyr BP) using carbon and oxygen isotopes from benthic \n\nforaminifera (Cibicidoides and Uvigerina genera) of a radiocarbon dated marine sediment \n\ncore (1100m water depth and 20?S, off the Brazilian coast). We find that AAIW\u2019s physical \n\nand chemical properties changed Heinrich stadials 3 and 4, probably as a consequence of \n\nAMOC decreased strength during these periods.  We also reconstruct Last Glacial Maximum \n\nand deglacial (23-12 cal kyr BP) continental conditions over eastern Brazil based on Ti/Ca of \n\nour marine sediment core as a proxy for Doce River (draining eastern Brazil) terrigenous \n\ninput. Most of the rainfall in the Doce River Basin is related to the activity of the SASM. Our \n\nTi/Ca record together with a speleothem ?18O composite from Lapa Sem Fim Cave, also in \n\neastern Brazil, suggests a major decrease in precipitation during the B\u00f8lling\u2013Aller\u00f8d \n\ninterstadial, likely related to a weakening of the SASM. We further compared our Ti/Ca \n\nresults with the output of the SYNTRACE run of the CCSM3 fully-coupled climate model \n\nwith transient forcing for the last deglaciation. Geochemical records and model output show \n\nconsistent results and suggest that eastern South America experienced the driest period of the \n\nwhole last deglaciation during the B\u00f8lling\u2013Aller\u00f8d and that this dry spell was likely related to \n\ndecreased SAMS intensity. \n\n \n\nKeywords: paleoclimatology, paleoceanography, Quaternary, geochemistry, \n\nforaminifera, AMOC, millennial events, precipitation.   \n\n\n\n iii \n\nResumo \n\nPara dar suporte ao atual debate sobre as consequ\u00eancias clim\u00e1ticas da libera\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nantropog\u00eanica de CO2 na atmosfera, o refinamento do conhecimento sobre mudan\u00e7as \n\nclim\u00e1ticas e oceanogr\u00e1ficas no passado \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio. A Circula\u00e7\u00e3o de Revolvimento \n\nMeridional do Atl\u00e2ntico (CRMA) tem papel fundamental na oceanografia e clima das \u00e1reas \n\nsob influ\u00eancia do Oceano Atl\u00e2ntico, controlando diretamente a estratifica\u00e7\u00e3o e distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nmassas d\u2019\u00e1gua, a quantidade de calor transportada pelo oceano e os ciclo e armazenamento de \n\ncompostos qu\u00edmicos, como o CO2 em mar profundo. A forma\u00e7\u00e3o e circula\u00e7\u00e3o da \u00c1gua \n\nIntermedi\u00e1ria Ant\u00e1rtica (AIA), envolvida no transporte de calor e sal para o giro subtropical \n\ndo Hemisf\u00e9rio Sul e nas teleconex\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas entre altas e baixas latitudes, \u00e9 componente \n\nimportante do ramo superior da CRMA. A reconstru\u00e7\u00e3o de propriedades de massas de \u00e1gua \n\nintermedi\u00e1rias \u00e9, portanto, importante para a compreens\u00e3o dos sistemas de retroalimenta\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nentre oceano-clima. No entanto, informa\u00e7\u00f5es quanto a evolu\u00e7\u00e3o da AIA continuam limitadas. \n\nOscila\u00e7\u00f5es da CRMA e consequentes mudan\u00e7as na distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de calor tem implica\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nimportantes para o clima Sul Americano, influenciando a disponibilidade de umidade para o \n\nSistema de Mon\u00e7\u00f5es Sul Americano (SMSA), via temperatura da superf\u00edcie marinha e \n\nposicionamento da Zona de Converg\u00eancia Intertropical. Neste trabalho n\u00f3s reconstru\u00edmos a \n\nassinatura isot\u00f3pica da AIA durante os est\u00e1gios isot\u00f3picos marinhos 2 e 3 (41-12 cal ka AP) \n\nusando is\u00f3topos de carbono e oxig\u00eanio de foramin\u00edferos bent\u00f4nicos (g\u00eaneros Cibicidoides e \n\nUvigerina) de um testemunho de sedimentos marinhos datados por radiocarbono (1100 m de \n\nprofundidade e a 20?S na costa do Brasil). Conclu\u00edmos que propriedades f\u00edsicas e qu\u00edmicas da \n\nAIA mudaram durante os estadiais Heinrich 3 e 4, provavelmente como consequ\u00eancia de \n\nenfraquecimento da CRMA durante estes per\u00edodos. Tamb\u00e9m reconstru\u00edmos as condi\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ncontinentais do leste brasileiro entre o \u00faltimo m\u00e1ximo glacial e a deglacia\u00e7\u00e3o (23-12 cal ka \n\nAP) baseadas em raz\u00f5es Ti/Ca de nosso testemunho de sedimentos marinhos como \n\nindicadoras de aporte terr\u00edgeno do Rio Doce. A maior parte da chuva que cai na Bacia do Rio \n\nDoce est\u00e1 relacionada a atividade do SMAS. Nosso registro de Ti/Ca em conjunto com ?18O \n\nde espeleotemas da Caverna Lapa Sem Fim, tamb\u00e9m no leste do Brasil, sugere diminui\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nmarcante da chuva durante o interestadial B\u00f8lling\u2013Aller\u00f8d, provavelmente relacionada a \n\nenfraquecimento do SMAS. Ademais comparamos as raz\u00f5es de Ti/Ca com dados de sa\u00edda da \n\nrodada SYNTRACE do modelo clim\u00e1tico CCSM3 com for\u00e7antes transientes para a \u00faltima \n\ndeglacia\u00e7\u00e3o. Os registros geoqu\u00edmicos e a sa\u00edda do modelo mostram resultados consistentes \n\nentre si e sugerem que o leste da Am\u00e9rica do Sul passou pelo seu per\u00edodo mais seco de toda a \n\n\u00faltima deglacia\u00e7\u00e3o durante o interestadial B\u00f8lling\u2013Aller\u00f8d, provavelmente relacionado ao \n\nenfraquecimento do SMAS. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: paleoclimatologia, paleoceanografia, Quatern\u00e1rio, geoqu\u00edmica, \n\nforamin\u00edferos, CRMA, eventos milenares, chuva.   \n\n\n\n iv \n\nList of abbreviations / Lista de abrevia\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nAABW \u2013 Antarctic Bottom Water \n\nAAIW \u2013 Antarctic Intermediate Water \n\nAMOC \u2013 Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation \n\nAMS \u2013 Accelerator mass spectrometry  \n\nBA \u2013 B\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d Interstadial \n\nCa \u2013 Calcium \n\nCDW \u2013 Circumpolar Deep Water \n\nCO2 \u2013 Carbon dioxide  \n\nCorg \u2013 Organic carbon \n\nDO \u2013 Dansgaard-Oeschger Interstadial  \n\nDIC \u2013 Dissolved inorganic carbon \n\n?13C \u2013 Isotopic ratio of 13C relatively to 12C  \n\n?13Cc -

Introduction and objectives / Introdu\u00e7\u00e3o e objetivos \n\n Introduction / Introdu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nThe Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) plays a fundamental role in \n\nthe oceanography and climate of the Atlantic realm. As such, AMOC activity directly controls \n\nstratification and distribution of water masses, the amount of heat that is transported by the \n\nocean, and the cycling and storage of chemical species, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) in the \n\ndeep sea (Kuhlbrodt et al., 2007). Past changes in global atmospheric CO2 concentrations over \n\ninterglacial and glacial cycles may have been driven by changes in ventilation and circulation \n\nof intermediate and deep waters (e.g., Siegenthaler and Wenk, 1984).  \n\nThe formation and circulation of Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) is an important \n\ncomponent of the upper branch of the AMOC, involved in the transport of heat and salt within \n\nthe Southern Hemisphere (SH) subtropical gyre (Talley, 1996). Upon its formation on the \n\nSubantarctic Frontal Zone, AAIW sequesters significant quantities of CO2 (Talley, 1996; \n\nSabine et al., 2004), which are then widely distributed in SH oceans (Lynch-Stieglitz et al., \n\n1994). Reconstructing intermediate water properties is, therefore, important for understanding \n\nfeedbacks within the ocean-climate system. However, information on intermediate water mass \n\nevolution remains limited (Elmore et al., 2015). \n\nThe South American Summer Monsoon (SASM) is one of the major monsoon systems \n\nin the SH and the most important climatic feature in South America (SA; Vera et al., 2006; \n\nCarvalho et al., 2012). Its strength is dependent on insolation with moisture availability \n\nmodulated by Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) positioning (Vera et al., 2006). Given \n\nthat the former is controlled by sea surface temperatures (SST; Nobre and Shukla, 1996), \n\nAMOC oscillations and changes in heat distribution have strong implications for the South \n\nAmerican climate.  \n\nDeglaciation periods offer the possibility to study in detail the impact of rapid climatic \n\nchanges on the environment (Wohlfarth, 1996). The last deglaciation, or Termination I, \n\nstarted between 20 and 18 kyr ago in the SH with continuous increase in temperature and \n\ngreenhouse gas concentration (Petit et al., 1999; Marcott et al., 2014). For over 3 kyr \n\nAntarctica warmed while Greenland and the North Atlantic remained cold. The Northern \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n2 \n\nHemisphere (NH) cold period between 18.1 and 14.7, known as Heinrich stadial 1 (HS1), \n\nended abruptly at the start of the B\u00f8lling\u2013Aller\u00f8d interstadial (Rasmussen et al., 2006). This \n\nabrupt transition was marked by the restart of the AMOC (McManus et al., 2004) and \n\nwarming in NH (Petit et al., 1999), with a corresponding return to cold conditions in the south \n\n(Blunier et al., 1997). \n\nPrevious studies have correlated pulses of terrigenous input with cold events in the NH \n\noff the coast of generally dry northeastern SA (Arz et al., 1998; Arz et al., 1999; Jennerjahn et \n\nal., 2004; Jaeschke et al., 2007; Nace et al., 2014). Yet, the 23-7\u00baS sector of the Brazilian \n\ncontinental margin remains completely void of studies. This is a particularly relevant sector of \n\nthe continental margin for reconstructing the strength of the SASM. Oxygen isotopic \n\noscillations from stalagmites have provided a glimpse of how continental climate responded \n\nto past millennial scale abrupt events (Wang et al., 2008a; Str\u00edkis et al., 2015). However the \n\nseveral other areas of the continent and proximal marine environments are still not resolved.  \n\nThe mere possibility that the AMOC could change was already a strong motivator to \n\nunderstand how it may have oscillated in the past (Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 2007). A recent \n\nstudy confirmed that the AMOC is currently weakening (Rahmstorf et al., 2015), highlighting \n\nthe urgency of researching about the impacts of past AMOC strength oscillations and abrupt \n\nclimatic events during the glacial and deglacial periods.  \n\n Objectives / Objetivos \n\nThe main objectives of this dissertation are: \n\n(i) Investigate the isotopic evolution of southern sourced water masses (i.e., AAIW, \n\nUCDW and their glacial correspondents) in the western tropical South Atlantic throughout the \n\nlast glacial and Termination I, and suggest its driving mechanisms; \n\n(ii) Determine changes in major elements of sediments from the western tropical South \n\nAtlantic throughout the last glacial and Termination I, and suggest its driving mechanisms; \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n3 \n\n2. State of the art / Revis\u00e3o bibliogr\u00e1fica \n\n Modern oceanography and climate / Oceanografia e climatologia \n\nmodernas \n\n2.1.1. The modern Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation / A C\u00e9lula de \n\nRevolvimento Meridional do Atl\u00e2ntico no presente \n\nThe Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), correspondent to the \n\nAtlantic section of the global termohaline circulation, plays a fundamental role in the \n\noceanography and climate of the Atlantic realm. The ocean affects climate through its high \n\nheat capacity relative to the surrounding land, thereby moderating daily, seasonal and \n\ninterannual temperature fluctuations, and through its ability to transport large amounts of heat \n\npolewards, whereas freshwater input to high latitudes and low-latitude evaporation tend to \n\nbrake this flow (Clark et al., 2002). The AMOC is responsible for much of the total oceanic \n\npoleward heat transport in the Atlantic, peaking at about 1.2 \u00b1 0.3 PW (1 PW equals 1015 \n\nWatts) at 24\u00baN (Ganachaud and Wunsch, 2000). The northward-flowing Atlantic surface \n\nwaters are warm, whereas the southward-flowing deep waters are cold defining a meridional \n\nheat flux and a net northward transport of heat (Figure 2.1). \n\nThe AMOC activity directly controls stratification and distribution of water masses, the \n\namount of heat that is transported by the ocean, and the cycling and storage of chemical \n\nspecies, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) in the deep sea (Kuhlbrodt et al., 2007). It can be \n\ndivided in four main branches: upwelling processes bringing older water from depth to near \n\nthe ocean surface, surface currents that transport relatively light warm waters toward high \n\nlatitudes, deepwater formation regions where waters become denser and sink, and deep \n\ncurrents closing the loop. These four branches span the entire Atlantic on both hemispheres, \n\nforming a circulation system that consists of two overturning cells, a deep one with North \n\nAtlantic Deep Water (NADW) and an abyssal one with Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW; \n\nKuhlbrodt et al., 2007).  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n4 \n\nWarm and saline waters from the Southern Subtropical Gyre (SSG), with contribution \n\nof the waters brought by the Agulhas Current from the Indian Ocean, cross the Equator via \n\nthe North Brazil Current (NBC), and ultimately contribute to the northward flowing Gulf \n\nStream. At high latitudes of the North Atlantic, these high salinity surface and intermediate \n\nwaters lose buoyancy as they transmit heat to the atmosphere and sink forming the southward \n\nflowing NADW. \n\nDeep-water formation in the Southern Ocean occurs along the Antarctic continental \n\nshelf in the Weddell and Ross Seas either through intense evaporation or, more typically, \n\nthrough brine rejection that produces dense waters that sink along the slope (Killworth, 1983). \n\nAs a result, the North Atlantic surface is relatively warmer and saltier than its equivalent \n\nin the South Atlantic. South of the Equator, the nutrient poor NADW occupies from 1500 to \n\n4000 m water depth and lies within the density range of the northward flowing Circumpolar \n\nDeep Water (CDW). The latter is then divided in two layers: Upper Circumpolar Deep Water \n\n(UCDW) and Lower Circumpolar Deep Water (LCDW), each of them less saline, richer in \n\nnutrients and lower in oxygen than NADW (Reid et al., 1977; Figure 2.2). UCDW is defined \n\nas a local oxygen and temperature minimum located below the salinity minimum and local \n\noxygen maximum characteristic of the Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW; Tsuchiya and \n\nTalley, 1994). Under LCDW, AABW bathes the South Atlantic sea floor below 4000 m with \n\ncold and nutrient rich waters (Figure 2.2). \n\nFigure 2.1: Global termohaline circulation.

It migrates seasonally towards the hemisphere being warmed in \n\nrelationship to the other, shifting latitudinally in response to zonal sea surface temperatures \n\n(SST) gradients, which itself contributes to the distribution of sea level pressure and winds \n\nFigure 2.2: (a) Position of the Atlantic latitudinal section and (b, c, and d) main characteristics of \n\nAtlantic water masses. (b) Long-term mean salinity along the Atlantic (color-scale shading) (Zweng \n\net al., 2014); (c) Long-term mean oxygen along the Atlantic (color-scale shading) (Garcia et al., \n\n2014a); (d) Long-term mean phosphate along the Atlantic (color-scale shading) (Garcia et al., \n\n2014b). Water masses are shown schematically by their acronyms: AABW \u2013 Antarctic Bottom \n\nWater, AAIW \u2013 Antarctic Intermediate Water, LCDW \u2013 Lower Circumpolar Deep Water, NADW \u2013 \n\nNorth Atlantic Deep Water, and, UCDW \u2013 Upper Circumpolar Deep Water. This figure was prepared \n\nusing Ocean Data View 4 (Schlitzer, 2015). \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n6 \n\n(Nobre and Shukla, 1996; Chiang and Kushnir, 2002; Schneider et al., 2014). The Atlantic \n\nsection of the ITCZ migrates seasonally reaching its northernmost location, 10\u00b0N, in August \n\nand southernmost, 1\u00b0S, in March (mean latitudes at longitude 30\u00b0W; Nobre and Shukla, \n\n1996). Nevertheless, it has been suggested that during abrupt cooling events on the Northern \n\nHemisphere (NH) it migrated further southward of the Equator (e.g., Deplazes et al., 2013).  \n\nThe South American Summer Monsoon (SASM) has its onset in October, when \n\nmoisture influx to the Amazon Basin from the Atlantic Ocean is intensified due to increased \n\nthermal gradients between land and sea, stronger trade winds, and the southward shift on the \n\nITCZ position (Vera et al., 2006). Efficient transport of humidity from the Tropical Atlantic \n\ninto South America (SA), reaches the Amazon Basin, where intense convective activity takes \n\nplace. \n\nThe SASM most active phase is between December and February (austral summer), \n\nwhen a deep continental low forms over the Chaco region (due to insolation increase in the \n\nSouthern Hemisphere, around 25\u00b0S; Seluchi et al., 2003) and forces the easterly winds over \n\nthe Amazon basin to turn southward, channeled via Low Level Jets (LLJ) between the eastern \n\nslope of the Andes and the Brazilian Plateau (Garreaud et al., 2009). During this peak phase, a \n\nprominent warm-core anticyclone establishes itself over the elevated Altiplano of the central \n\nAndes, the Bolivian High (BH), defined by Lenters and Cook (1997) as \u201ca collective response \n\nto precipitation in the Amazon, central Andes, and South Atlantic Convergence Zone \n\n(SACZ), with its position over the Altiplano being largely the result of Amazonian \n\nprecipitation\u201d. The latent heat release over the Amazon Basin and the establishment of the BH \n\nare also connected to the development of SACZ, a transient convective system characterized \n\nby a NW-SE nebulosity band formed by transport of Amazon moisture via LLJ to \n\nsoutheastern SA (Figure 2.3) and the Atlantic (Liebmann et al., 1999; Carvalho et al., 2004; \n\nVera et al., 2006). The intensity of the SASM is mainly influenced by insolation, which is \n\nmodulated by precession and excentricity, and by the dynamics of the ITCZ. Higher (lower) \n\naustral summer insolation over the Southern Hemisphere (SH) strengthens (weakens) the \n\nmonsoon system by increasing (decreasing) the land-sea thermal gradient. On the other hand, \n\nthe ITCZ position modulates the amount of humidity influx to the Amazon Basin and \n\nsoutheastern SA. The SASM has its demise in April (Marengo et al., 2001; Raia and \n\nCavalcanti, 2008).  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3: Monthly long term mean sea surface temperature (SST) (Locarnini et al., 2013) and monthly long term mean precipitation \n\n(Xie and Arkin, 1997).

Figure partially produced with Ocean Data View 4 (Schlitzer, 2015). \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n8 \n\nDuring the austral winter, central SA (including southern Amazonia) experiences the \n\ndry season with maximum continental rainfall occurring to the north of the equator. Further \n\nsouth, precipitation is associated with moisture brought by extratropical cyclones and cold \n\nfronts (Garreaud et al., 2009).  \n\nThe SACZ is evident year round but more intense during austral summer (the SASM \n\nseason), when it is connected with the area of convection over the central part of the \n\ncontinent, producing episodes of intense rainfall over much of southeastern SA (Liebmann et \n\nal., 1999). Warm anomalies in SST in subtropical South Atlantic are associated with \n\nsouthward displacement of the SACZ with contributes to increase precipitation over \n\nsoutheastern SA (Diaz et al., 1998; Barros et al., 2000).  \n\n Paleoceanography and paleoclimatology / Paleoceanografia e \n\npaleoclimatologia \n\n2.2.1. Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation oscillations during the Last Glacial \n\nMaximum and Termination I / Oscila\u00e7\u00f5es da C\u00e9lula de Revolvimento Meridional do \n\nAtl\u00e2ntico durante o \u00daltimo M\u00e1ximo Glacial e a Termina\u00e7\u00e3o I \n\nExtreme, abrupt climate oscillations during the last glacial cycle were modulated by \n\nchanges in ocean circulation and atmospheric forcing (Rahmstorf, 2002). Data and models \n\nboth suggest that abrupt climate change during the last glaciation originated through changes \n\nin the AMOC in response to changes in the hydrological cycle or freshwater input in the high \n\nlatitudes of the NH. Atmospheric and oceanic responses to these changes were then \n\ntransmitted globally through a number of feedbacks (Clark et al., 2002). \n\nAlthough theoretical studies and ocean general circulation model experiments suggest \n\nthat the AMOC may have multiple equilibria, paleoceanographic studies focus on three \n\nAMOC states or modi, characterized during specific timings as the Last Glacial Maximum \n\n(LGM, 19-23 cal kyr BP; Mix et al., 2001), the last deglaciation and modern times (Alley and \n\nClark, 1999). There\u2019s agreement on that transitions between the equilibria states were \n\ntriggered and/or associated to anomalies in the freshwater fluxes at the sea surface (Lynch-\n\nStieglitz et al., 2007). \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n9 \n\nThe existence of different AMOC states in the past has been first proposed and \n\ndiscussed mostly on the basis of nutrient tracers such as ?13C (Sarnthein et al., 1994), that are \n\ninversely correlated to nutrient content and Cd/Ca in tests of benthic foraminifera (see section \n\n4.2.4). Like the major nutrients, Cd is taken up by organisms at the sea surface and released at \n\ndepth as the organic material is decomposed. The agreement between reconstructions based \n\non these two water-mass tracers provides increased confidence in the overall picture.  \n\nDeep and vigorous overturning circulation, similar to the modern state, has persisted for \n\nmost of the last glacial cycle, dominating the oceanic circulation in the Atlantic (B\u00f6hm et al., \n\n2015). During deep glacial conditions (mainly glacial maxima), however, the upper cell of the \n\nAMOC may have been weaker and southern-sourced waters (SSW) advanced northwards and \n\nupwards in the water column, while NADW sank to depths of less than 2.500 m (Labeyrie et \n\nal., 1992). With the decrease of NADW formation, such as during the LGM, high nutrient/low \n\n?13C waters, like the modern SSW (i.e., AAIW, CDW and AABW) may have partially \n\nreplaced nutrient poor NADW and a large part of the deep Atlantic Ocean was bathed by deep \n\nwaters advected from the Southern Ocean (Duplessy et al., 1984; Curry and Oppo, 2005; \n\nLynch-Stieglitz et al., 2007). This shallower NADW is generally termed Glacial North \n\nAtlantic Intermediate Water (GNAIW) in paleoceanographic studies.  \n\nMore significant slowdowns of the AMOC, probably related to iceberg discharges and \n\nincreased freshwater input at the high latitudes of the NH, happened during Heinrich Stadials \n\n(HS; B\u00f6hm et al., 2015). The Heinrich-like mode of the AMOC is characterized as a quasi-\n\nhalt in NADW formation during HS1, for instance (Rahmstorf, 2002; McManus et al., 2004). \n\nIn contrast, the AMOC remained active during Dansgaard-Oeschger Interstadials (DO), \n\nabrupt warm events in the NH defined in ice cores from Greenland (B\u00f6hm et al., 2015).  \n\nFurthermore, McManus et al. (2004) used measurements of 231Pa/230Th to trace the \n\nstrength of the AMOC since the LGM and confirmed that the AMOC was nearly, or \n\ncompletely, eliminated during cold abrupt deglacial intervals in the North Atlantic region, \n\nnamely HS1 and the Younger Dryas (YD; Figure 2.4).  \n\nIn the South Atlantic, low ?13C values (correlated with glacial SSW or more specifically \n\nthe glacial correspondents of AAIW, i.e., GAAIW, and UCDW, in this case) have been \n\ndocumented between ~1600 and 2500 m in the western side of the basin (Tessin and Lund, \n\n2013), and above 1800 m in the tropical Atlantic (Zahn and St\u00fcber, 2002; Lynch-Stieglitz et \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n10 \n\nal., 2014), early in the deglaciation. While a few studies suggested that greater northward \n\nadvection of GAAIW during HS1 caused low ?13C at relatively shallow depths (Rickaby et \n\nal., 2005; Pahnke et al., 2008), more recent studies using cores from modern AAIW depths \n\nsuggest that the northward extent of GAAIW decreased during HS1 and the YD, presumably \n\nin response to a reduced AMOC (Xie et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2014).  \n\nIt is still not clear if the AMOC has always controlled or at times only responded to \n\nabrupt climatic oscillations during the last glacial period (B\u00f6hm et al., 2015). Nevertheless, \n\nice cores show that Antarctica cooled during the major warm phases of the Greenland DO \n\ncycles and vice versa (Blunier and Brook, 2001; EPICA Community Members, 2006), \n\nsupporting the idea of an interhemispheric redistribution of heat (bipolar seesaw; EPICA \n\nCommunity Members, 2006; Barker et al., 2009). WAIS Divide Project Members (2015) \n\nresults demonstrated north-to-south directionality of the abrupt climatic signal, propagated to \n\nthe SH high latitudes by oceanic processes (abrupt Greenland warming led Antarctic cooling \n\nonset by 218 \u00b1 92 years for D\u2013O events, including the B\u00f8lling event, and Greenland cooling \n\nled onset of Antarctic warming by 208 \u00b1 96 years). \n\n  \n\nFigure 2.4: Predominant AMOC modes as derived from the combined \n231\n\nPa/\n230Th records.

Curry and Oppo (2005) updated \n\nthe glacial western Atlantic cross section published by Duplessy et al. (1988) and indicated \n\nthat above 2000 m, the bathymetric ?13C gradients in the South Atlantic revealed the presence \n\nof two main water masses (Figure 2.5). The shallower, between 800 and 1200 m and centered \n\nat 1000 m water depth, was most likely sourced in the Southern Ocean and was interpreted as \n\nthe glacial equivalent of AAIW (GAAIW). Centered at 1500 m and derived from the north \n\nthere was another mid depth water mass, interpreted as the southern expression of GNAIW.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5: Comparison of ?13C distribution along the western Atlantic for the modern \n\nocean (GEOSECS) and during the Last Glacial Maximum.

Oppo and Horowitz (2000) had already identified this water \n\nmass as similar to AAIW but without the relatively high ?13C value caused by air-sea \n\nexchange.  \n\nGNAIW originated in the North Atlantic with a ?13C value of about 1.5\u2030 and reached \n\nthe Brazil Margin with ?13C values of >0.8\u2030. Its much lower ?13C value in the South Atlantic \n\nimplies that GNAIW underwent significant aging along its flow path or its ?13C value resulted \n\nfrom mixing with a water mass of lower ?13C.  \n\nCurry and Oppo (2005) reported LGM AABW as the third main water mass in the \n\nSouth Atlantic (below GNAIW), flowing from the deep Southern Ocean and originating with \n\nan end-member ?13C value of -0.2\u2030 and possibly as low as -0.9% (Ninnemann and Charles, \n\n2002). \n\n2.2.3.

These abrupt warm events were termed \n\nDansgaard-Oeschger (DO). Cold events, defined by concentration of Ice Rafted Debris (IRD) \n\n\u2013rich layers within marine sediment cores from the high latitudes of the North Atlantic were \n\ntermed Heinrich (Bond et al., 1992). \n\nLater on, Peterson et al. (2000), for instance, showed that the abrupt changes described \n\nfor the high latitudes of the NH were also recorded in the tropics. They based their \n\nconclusions in a 90,000-year sediment record from the anoxic Cariaco Basin off the coast of \n\nnorthern Venezuela (Figure 2.6). Variations in the terrigenous input to Cariaco Basin reflected \n\nchanges in the hydrological cycle related to the Atlantic ITCZ, which resulted in color \n\nreflectance variations. Within dating uncertainty, the Cariaco record matches the abrupt \n\nclimate change showed in the Greenland ice cores. Another record, ?18O obtained from \n\nstalagmites from Hulu Cave in China (Figure 2.6), also exhibited strong resemblance to the \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n13 \n\nGreenland ?18O record, showing all major Greenland DOs (Wang et al., 2001). These records \n\nsuggested a strong and fast linkage between the high-latitude North Atlantic temperatures \n\nwith rainfall in the Atlantic ITCZ and Asian monsoon regions.  \n\nHeinrich Stadials impacted continental tropical climates mainly through changes in \n\nintensity of monsoon systems. In SA, during these events, a significant decrease in North \n\nAtlantic SST shifted the ITCZ location southwards, strengthening the SASM (Wang et al., \n\n2004). In the NH, the same southward shift of the ITCZ associated with an expansion of the \n\nSiberian extratropical anticyclone reduced the Asian Monsoon intensity (Wang et al., 2001; \n\nWang et al., 2008b).  \n\nFigure 2.6: Proxy records spanning from 10 to 70 cal kyr BP that demonstrate the close relationship \n\nbetween Greenland temperatures and rainfall records from the tropical Atlantic and China during the last \n\nglacial period.

(2003) highlighted the sensitivity of the Atlantic \n\nITCZ position during the last glacial to changes in both land ice and sea ice extent. Together, \n\nmodeling efforts are consistent with the hypothesis that AMOC variations, and their effect on \n\nheat transport, hemispheric SST patterns, and ITCZ position, can be invoked to explain the \n\nstrong covariation observed between Greenland and Cariaco Basin proxy records (Hughen et \n\nal., 1996; Peterson et al., 2000; Chiang and Friedman, 2012).  \n\nIn Brazil, the first studies on the impact of millennial abrupt events were (Arz et al., \n\n1998; Arz et al., 1999), based in terrigenous input and planktonic foraminifera ?18O off NE \n\nBrazil. They showed increased terrigenous input during Heinrich events due to a southward \n\nshift of the ITCZ. Within the continent, series of ?18O from stalagmites confirmed the \n\nantiphase correlation between the intensity of the Asian and South American monsoon \n\nsystems, demonstrated that stalagmite growth in caves of northeastern Brazil occurred only \n\nduring wet phases synchronous with Heinrich events (Wang et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2007) \n\nand related negative ?18O excursions with SAMS intensification in speleothems from caves in \n\nsoutheastern SA (Cruz et al., 2005a; Cruz et al., 2005b; Cruz et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2007). \n\nOther factors controlling regional paleoclimatic changes included latitudinal variations in the \n\nAMOC (Wang et al., 2007; Cruz et al., 2009). \n\n2.2.4. The B\u00f8lling - Aller\u00f8d Interstadial/ O interestadial B\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d \n\nThe historical and widely employed nomenclature for the main climatic events that \n\noccurred during Termination I include (from oldest to youngest; Mangerud et al., 1974) the \n\nOldest Dryas (OLD), B\u00f8lling, Older Dryas (OD), Aller\u00f8d, and Younger Dryas (YD). These \n\nterms were established in the beginning of the 20th century, primarily describing \n\nbiostratigraphic changes, more specifically changes in the content of palynomorphs in \n\nsediment layers, in Danish lakes. The alternation between layers containing pollen from \n\nDryas octopetala, characteristic of tundra, and remains of Bertulaceae family, adjusted to \n\ntemperate climate, indicated the oscillation between extremely cold and milder climates, \n\nrespectively (Iversen, 1954; Anderson, 1997). \n\nIn this sense, OLD is chronostratigraphically poorly defined, being usually replaced by \n\nHeinrich Stadial 1 because of the apparent synchronicity (Rasmussen et al., 2014). The term \n\nOD, referring to a brief relatively cold phase between Aller\u00f8d and B\u00f8lling warm phases \n\n(Wohlfarth, 1996) around 13.5 cal kyr BP, has not been used because of the little evidence for \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n15 \n\na comparably significant climatic oscillation between Aller\u00f8d and B\u00f8lling warm phases \n\noutside of Northern Europe (Gray and Lowe, 1977), in principle justifying the usage of \n\nB\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d as one continuous warm phase (interstadial). YD is a relative term \n\ndistinguishing between a younger layer chronostratigraphically dated around 12 cal kyr BP \n\nand OD. Among these terms, YD is the most largely used.   \n\nThe B\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d Interstadial (BA), on the other hand, has been consistently \n\ndescribed in tree-rings from Germany (Friedrich et al., 2001), marine sediments from Cariaco \n\nBasin (Hughen et al., 2000), stalagmites in Asia (e.g., Sinha et al., 2005; Cheng et al., 2013), \n\nMg/Ca in planktonic foraminifera from the western South Atlantic (Chiessi et al., 2008), ice \n\ncores from Greenland (e.g., Rasmussen et al., 2014; although in this record BA is referred to \n\nas DO-1), and the South American Andes (e.g., Thompson et al., 1998). \n\nThe BA is one of the most significant abrupt events of Termination I. One of the \n\nreasons relates to the major increase in atmospheric CO2 and CH4 concentrations, around 12 \n\nppmv (parts per million per volume) and 150 ppbv (parts per billion per volume), \n\nrespectively, within a time interval between 50 and 200 years (Marcott et al., 2014), and a \n\nsea-level rise of ~20 m in less than 500 years, namely Melt Water Pulse 1A (MWP1A) \n\n(Deschamps et al., 2012).  \n\nThe mechanisms that explain its occurrence remain unclear, but there have been \n\nindications that increased inflow of warm saline waters from the Indian Ocean entered the \n\nAtlantic via the Agulhas Leakage around 14.9 cal kyr BP (Chiessi et al., 2008), which may \n\nhave contributed for the abrupt resumption  of the AMOC and consequently for the warming \n\nin the NH (McManus et al., 2004). Further on, a study by Thiagarajan et al. (2014) showed \n\nevidence that a thermal inversion (warm waters under cold ones) developed in deep North \n\nAtlantic around 15 cal kyr BP. This metastable thermal inversion was sustained by differential \n\nsalinity content and may have stored heat in deep North Atlantic, triggering the rapid AMOC \n\nrestart at the onset of BA as the built up warmth was released (Thiagarajan et al., 2014). In yet \n\nanother hypothesis, Koehler et al. (2014) defend that a sudden decrease in atmospheric ?14C \n\naround the onset of the BA indicates degassing of an extremely 14C\u2013poor or even 14C\u2013free \n\ncarbon source, possibly connected with thawing of extended areas of NH permafrost, would \n\nhave led to the anomalous northern hemispheric warming during the BA.  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n16 \n\nWhichever may have been the exact mechanism that led to the onset of the BA, it is \n\nwidely accepted that it is synchronous with a rapid switch in AMOC strength (McManus et \n\nal., 2004; Koehler et al., 2014) and that the abrupt atmospheric warming together with oceanic \n\nreorganization had world wide impact, leading to a return to colder conditions in Antarctica \n\n(e.g., Weber et al., 2014), an abrupt warm phase in Bolivian Andes (Thompson et al., 1998) \n\nand, higher terrigenous input as well as relatively warmer SST in Cariaco Basin (Peterson et \n\nal., 2000; Lea et al., 2003). The latter changes in Cariaco Basin probably indicate a northward \n\nshift (comparing to HS1) of the ITCZ during the BA. This condition may have led to a \n\nweakening of the SAMS and drier than normal conditions in central and eastern South \n\nAmerica (Catunda et al., in prep., see attached manuscript) \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n17 \n\n3. Study area, modern oceanography and climatology / \u00c1rea de \n\nestudo, oceanografia e climatologia modernas \n\n Study area / \u00c1rea de estudo  \n\nThe marine sediment cores selected for this project, GeoB3227-2 and GeoB3228-1 \n\n(P\u00e4tzold et al., 1996) (see section 4.1), were collected on the eastern Brazilian continental \n\nslope at the Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin, southward of the Abrolhos Bank and Vit\u00f3ria-Trindade \n\nRidge and close to the Doce River Canyon System (Schreiner et al., 2009). Continental slopes \n\npresent the most unstable sedimentation areas in the oceans, favorable for the development of \n\ncanyons and submarine incisions that serve as channels for the transport of terrigenous \n\nsediments from shallower areas and the continent to the deep ocean by turbidity currents \n\n(Heezen et al., 1959).  \n\nEastern Brazil (30\u00b0S to 15\u00b0S) is characterized by a mountainous landscape, bordered by \n\nnarrow coastal plains, high rainfall, tropical vegetation, and relatively short coastal rivers, \n\nlimiting the terrigenous input to the Eastern South American continental margin between La \n\nPlata and S\u00e3o Francisco rivers (Summerhayes et al., 1976; de Almeida et al., 1981).  \n\nThe Doce River Basin (Figure 3.1) is an important medium sized drainage basin in \n\neastern Brazilian coastal zone (Marques et al., 2004; de Oliveira et al., 2012) with area of \n\n86.715 km2 (http://www.cbhdoce.org.br/; Souza and Knoppers, 2003) constituting the second \n\nlargest drainage basin in eastern Brazil (after the S\u00e3o Francisco River Basin). The Doce River \n\noriginates in the mountainous hinterland, over 1300m of altitude (i.e., Serra da Mantiqueira \n\nand Serra do Espinha\u00e7o) and throughout its 850km course crosses the crystalline Precambrian \n\nbasement, covered by a thick weathered mantle, and the Tertiary coastal iron-rich sediments \n\nof the Barreiras-Formation (Gunnell, 1998; Carmo and Vasconcelos, 2004). \n\nhttp://www.cbhdoce.org.br/\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n18 \n\n \n\nTerrigenous sediments at our marine core sites (Figures 3.1 and 3.2) have been directly \n\ndelivered by the Doce River (Tintelnot, 1995; Tintelnot et al., 1998) during Late Pleistocene, \n\nwhen the river\u2019s mouth was located beyond the current shelf break, locally between 60 and 70 \n\nm water depth (Bastos et al., 2015). Under Pleistocene low sea-level conditions, the likely \n\ntransport path for terrigenous sediment to the study site was via one of the incised valleys of \n\nthe Doce River Canyon System (Brush et al., 2004; Schreiner et al., 2009; Maia, 2013; Figure \n\n3.2). Connections between the river and these incised valleys have been previously suggested \n\nin the scientific literature (Fran\u00e7a, 1979; Alves, 1999; Maia, 2013; Fran\u00e7a et al., 2015). \n\nFurthermore, geochemical measurements at the mid-continental slope of the Abrolhos Bank \n\nand the Doce River shelf (Tintelnot, 1995; Mass\u00e9 et al., 1996) registered high kaolinite \n\ncontents, connected with the eastern and southeastern Brazilian rivers\u2019 mineralogical \n\nsignature, supporting our provenance hypothesis. \n\nFigure 3.1: Location of the Doce River Basin (black line) and marine sediment cores GeoB3227-2 \n\n(1340 mbsl) and GeoB3228-1 (1095 mbsl).

The \n\ndelta formation kept pace with the deglacial rising sea level due to relatively high rainfall in \n\nthe Doce River drainage basin and high amount of total suspended sediments transported by \n\nthe river (Rossetti et al., 2015). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2: Doce River Canyon System and the location of marine sediment cores GeoB3228-1 and \n\nGeoB3227-2.

Starting around 10oS and flowing \n\nsouthward, BC is the western boundary current that closes the SSG (Figure 3.3). It originates \n\nat the bifurcation of the southern branch of South Equatorial Current, that also feeds the North \n\nBrazil Current (NBC; Stramma, 1991; Stramma and England, 1999). The BC starts as a \n\nrelatively weak western boundary current transporting waters warmer than 20\u00b0C and more \n\nsaline than 36 psu, namely Tropical Surface Water (TSW), increasing its transport volume \n\nsouthwards as the South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) reinforces the southward flow \n\n(Em\u00edlsson, 1961; Peterson and Stramma, 1991; Stramma and England, 1999; da Silveira et al., \n\n2000). The latter, is located just below the mixed layer (that has its lower limit around 70 m), \n\nand is described by a straight line between 20?C, 36 psu and 5?C, 34.3 psu in T-S diagrams \n\n(Figure 3.4; Stramma and England, 1999). Although SACW mainly originates in the SSG, it \n\nalso receives contribution from the south Indian Ocean by Agulhas Current intrusions \n\n(Stramma and England, 1999). Only the upper ca. 100 m of the water column are affected by \n\nseasonally varying temperatures and salinities in the western tropical South Atlantic (Peterson \n\nand Stramma, 1991). \n\nThe interaction of the BC, the morphological barrier of the broad and shallow Abrolhos \n\nBank and the Vit\u00f3ria-Trindade Ridge characterize the surface hydrography in the study area. \n\nIn April 1982, Evans et al. (1983) collected data showing that the BC flowed continuously \n\nthrough the passage closest to the coast and continued in a confined and organized way over \n\nthe continental slope. That view was adopted in the works of several following authors, \n\nincluding Peterson and Stramma (1991). However, data from surface drifters revealed the \n\nunexpected oceanographic complexity of the region, that is strongly affected by the temporal \n\noccurrence and migration of the Vit\u00f3ria Eddy (Schmid et al., 1995). It was then confirmed \n\nthat the surface temperatures and productivity on the shelf edge are affected by upwelling of \n\nSACW during austral summer, as previously suggested by Summerhayes et al. (1976). \n\nConsequently, the Doce River shelf presents special conditions, where local land input and \n\nupwelling of relatively nutrient-rich SACW at the shelf edge are significant factors \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n21 \n\ninfluencing the local sedimentation and primary production (Summerhayes et al., 1976; Ekau \n\nand Knoppers, 1996; Knoppers et al., 1999).  \n\nBelow SACW, at intermediate depths (i.e., 500 to 1500 m), the Intermediate Western \n\nBoundary Current transports AAIW and the underlying UCDW equatorwards (Figure 3.4; \n\nTsuchiya and Talley, 1994; Schmid et al., 1995; da Silveira et al., 2004). Compared with \n\nAAIW, SACW is warm and salty (Stramma and England, 1999). AAIW is formed in the \n\nSubantarctic Frontal Zone (Talley, 1996) from a surface region of the circumpolar layer and \n\nits characteristic relative oxygen maximum and salinity minimum were found in the study \n\narea at 800m water depth (Tsuchiya and Talley, 1994; Locarnini et al., 2013). Below AAIW, \n\nUCDW is defined by its very low oxygen content and can be recognized as an oxygen \n\nminimum tongue lying just under the relatively well oxygenated AAIW (Tsuchiya and Talley, \n\nFigure 3.3: (Above) Schematic representation of the \n\nlarge-scale, upper level geostrophic currents and \n\nfronts in the South Atlantic Ocean.

UCDW\u2019s relative potential temperature minimum and oxygen minimum were found \n\naround 1100m.  \n\nAt greater depths, the western tropical South Atlantic is filled by the southward flowing \n\nNorth Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) between ca. 1500 and 3000 m water depth, and two \n\nsouthern sourced northward flowing water masses, namely Lower Circumpolar Deep Water \n\n(LCDW) between ca. 3000 and 3500 m water depth, and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) \n\npresent between ca. 3500 m water depth and the bottom of the ocean (Stramma and England, \n\n1999). While NADW shows relatively high salinities, low nutrient content and high oxygen \n\nvalues, AAIW and UCDW are relatively fresh, show high nutrient content and low oxygen \n\nvalues (Figure 3.4). \n\n  \n\nFigure 3.4: Properties of the water column in the study area.

This seasonality is due to SASM and SACZ activity, fed by moisture \n\nfrom the ITCZ (see section 2.1.2). The average precipitation in the basin is 1400 mm/a with at \n\nleast 80% of the rain falling during the rainy season (October to March; Figure 3.5). \n\nExceptionally, in areas close to the coast, rains are distributed throughout the year, with \n\naustral winter rainfall brought by extratropical cyclones during the winter (Garreaud et al., \n\n2009). The river discharge is also the second largest of the Brazilian eastern coast and is \n\nstrongly seasonal, following the rainfall pattern. The river\u2019s runoff averages at 900 m3/s, \n\nvarying from 500 m3/s, from May to October, to 1300 m3/s, from November to April \n\n(www2.ana.gov.br; runoff measurements from the Colatina Water Station, located 90 km \n\nfrom the river mouth).

Gravity core \n\nGeoB3228-1 presents similar characteristics to GeoB3227-2. It is constituted mostly of olive \n\ngray mud with a reddish brown layer between 66 cm and 150 cm (Figure 4.1). \n\nMarine sediment core GeoB3228-1 was sampled for isotopic analyses every two \n\ncentimeters (276 samples in total) with 10 ml syringes, labelled, weighted while wet, packed \n\nand brought to the Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology Laboratory (P2L) at the School of \n\nArts, Sciences and Humanities of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. \n\nThe sample\u2019s preparation for benthic foraminifera selection was executed in the P2L, \n\nand consisted in drying (50?C maximum oven temperature), weighting the dry samples to \n\ncalculate water content, soaking in a beaker with water overnight, wet sieving over >125\u00b5m \n\nand >63\u00b5m combined meshes, rinsing both fractions with Milli-Q water and final drying \n\n(50?C maximum oven temperature) of the residues. After these steps, both fractions (>125 \u00b5m \n\nand between 125 \u00b5m and 63 \u00b5m) were stored in glass vials, labeled, and weighted.  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n26 \n\nThe sample\u2019s preparation for calibration of the element intensities was executed in \n\nlaboratories from the University of Bremen, Germany.

With this purpose, one AMS 14C dating was performed \n\napproximately every 50 cm for each marine sediment core. \n\nThree AMS 14C ages obtained at 6, 200 and 300 cm core depths of core GeoB3227-2 \n\nwere already available (Chiessi et al., unpublished data; Table 5.1, section 5.1). Similarly, \n\nseven AMS 14C ages at 8, 58, 108, 158, 208, 258 and 508 cm core depths of core GeoB3228-1 \n\nwere also available (Chiessi et al., unpublished data; Table 5.1, section 5.1). \n\nFor this project, 15 samples were chosen to produce detailed age models for both \n\ngravity cores. After sample preparation, 10mg of Globiogerinoides ruber tests (around 600 \n\ntests) of each sample were selected for AMS 14C dating from the >125 \u00b5m fraction using 25-\n\n50X magnification under a binocular microscope. For those cases where not enough G. ruber \n\nspecimens were available, the sample was complemented with Globigerinoides sacculifer. \n\nWhen both species were not enough to reach the desired mass, the amount was completed \n\nwith other planktic species, avoiding deep-dwellers such as Globorotalia truncatulinoides. \n\nThe 15 samples were then sent for analyses via AMS at BETA Analytic Laboratory, Miami, \n\nUSA.  \n\nThe raw radiocarbon ages were calibrated for the reservatory effect (Franke et al., 2008) \n\nand for variations on the original 14C concentration in the atmosphere (Reimer et al., 2013). \n\nFor this calibration we used software Calib 7.0.2 (Stuiver and Reimer, 1993) and the \n\nMarine13 calibration curve (Reimer et al., 2013). Age models were produced based on the \n\nlinear interpolation of the calibrated ages. \n\n4.2.3. Benthic foraminifera selection strategy / Estrat\u00e9gia para sele\u00e7\u00e3o de foramin\u00edferos \n\nbent\u00f4nicos \n\nBefore starting the systematic picking of benthic foraminifera for ?13C and ?18O \n\nanalyses, a preliminary selection of Cibicidoides/Cibicides and Uvigerina genera was \n\nperformed to assess the species availability within the first half of GeoB3228-1. The search \n\nwas conducted to evaluate if there was any unique species of these genera that would be \n\npresent throughout the Holocene and Termination I sections of the core, established using the \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n28 \n\npreliminary age model available. The results of this preliminary search are shown in Table \n\n4.1. \n\nTable 4.1 Results of the preliminary selection of benthic foraminifera from core GeoB3228-1, \n\nconsidering the genera Cibicidoides/Cibicides and Uvigerina (orange and blue background show the \n\nHolocene and Termination I, respectively).

From these latter genera, \n\nthe following species were found (from the more abundant to the less abundant): Cibicidoides \n\nsubhaidingerii (Parr, 1950), Cibicides pachyderma (Rzehak, 1886) and Cibicides \n\nwuellerstorfi (Schwager, 1866). Thus, U. peregrina and Cibicidoides spp. (a mixture among \n\nCibicides and/or Cibicidoides specimes present at each sample) specimens were picked \n\nseparately.  \n\nMicrofossil slides were used to store three to eight tests of U. peregrina or Cibicidoides \n\nspp.. Each test was over 0.3 mm and picked from the >125\u00b5m fraction using 25-50X \n\nmagnification under a binocular microscope. On eventual samples where the Cibicidoides \n\nand/or Cibicides genera were abundant, three to five tests of individual species were picked. \n\nThis aimed to perform a comparison between Cibicidoides spp. isotopic values and species \n\nspecific isotopic offsets available in the scientific literature (e.g., Fontanier et al., 2006). \n\nIn total 441 samples of benthic foraminifera were picked along GeoB3228-1\u2019s full \n\nextension.   \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n29 \n\n4.2.4. ?18O and ?13C of benthic foraminifera / ?18O e ?13C de foramin\u00edferos bent\u00f4nicos \n\nOxygen and carbon stable isotopes are traditional paleooceanographic proxies used for \n\nreconstituting physical and chemical characteristics of water masses and ocean circulation. \n\n?18O in marine carbonates is presently widely applied for assessing past variability in ocean \n\ncirculation (e.g., Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 2006), continental ice volume (e.g., Waelbroeck et al., \n\n2002), ocean water salinity (e.g., Adkins et al., 2002; Weldeab et al., 2006) and, paired with \n\nMg/Ca, temperature (e.g., Emiliani, 1955; Waelbroeck et al., 2002). ?13C of foraminiferal \n\ncalcite provide a wealth of information on the carbon cycling of the oceans, and has been used \n\nto infer the distribution of deep water masses and their geographic and bathymetric \n\ndistributions (e.g., Curry and Oppo, 2005), but also for variations of biological productivity \n\nand variations in the global carbon cycle (e.g., Duplessy et al., 1988).  \n\nIsotopic ratios of stable isotopes are a measurement of fractionation processes. The \n\nisotopic composition of a sample is expressed using the ? notation (i.e., ?18O and ?13C), which \n\nrepresents the difference between the ratio of the least over the most abundant isotope of a \n\nsample and an internationally recognized standard, expressed in parts per thousand (i.e., \u2030). \n\nEquation 1 exemplifies the calculation of ?18O. \n\nEquation 1: \n\n?18??????? = [\n( ?18 ?16? )\n\n??????\n? ( ?18 ?16? )\n\n????????\n\n( ?18 ?16? )\n????????\n\n]?103 \n\n, which can be written as: \n\n?18??????? = [\n( ?18 ?16? )\n\n??????\n\n( ?18 ?16? )\n????????\n\n? 1] ?103 \n\n \n\nFor carbonate isotopic ratios the most used standard is Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite \n\n(VPDB), normalized in relationship to the chemical composition of Belemnitella americana \n\nfossil shells from the cretaceous Pee Dee Formation in the United States and provided by the \n\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, Austria.  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n30 \n\nThe oxygen isotopic composition in marine carbonates varies both with temperature and \n\nthe isotopic composition of seawater, which is in turn dependent on the global ice volume and \n\ncorrelated with local salinity (Waelbroeck et al., 2002; Mulitza et al., 2003). Surface ?18Ow is \n\ngenerally positively correlated to salinity because both parameters are largely controlled by \n\nevaporation and precipitation (Craig and Gordon, 1965). Although the relationship between \n\nsalinity, temperature and foraminiferal ?18O is relatively well understood, the latter cannot be \n\nused as a directly proportionate proxy for either temperature or salinity because both affect \n\n?18O in opposite directions and, therefore, tend to cancel each other out (Curry and Oppo, \n\n2005). Still, the equilibrium calcite ?18O values of water masses originating in the South \n\nAtlantic is generally higher at every water depth and denser than water masses originating in \n\nthe North Atlantic because the difference in temperature dominates the equilibrium ?18O \n\nvalues (Curry and Oppo, 2005). ?18O in benthic foraminifera is a valuable deep water tracer, \n\nwhich values reflect conservative sea water properties and, assuming negligible geothermal \n\nand pressure heating effects, can only change due to mixing between water masses (e.g., \n\nOppo et al., 2015).  \n\nA wide variety of factors affect seawater carbon composition (e.g., biological \n\nproductivity and global carbon cycle) and its isotopic incorporation in foraminiferal calcite \n\n(e.g., species specific vital effects). Despite of that, ?13C is a useful proxy as water mass tracer \n\nbecause it is characteristic of its formation and can only be altered by mixing with water \n\nmasses of another ?13C composition, by the oxidation of low-?13C organic matter or \u2018\u2018aging\u2019\u2019 \n\n(Curry and Lohmann, 1982; Kroopnick, 1985; Curry and Oppo, 2005).  \n\nForaminifera use marine total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) to precipitate their \n\ncalcite tests, recording ?13C of seawater. DIC comprises the sum of the concentrations of CO2 \n\n(aqueous carbon dioxide), HCO3- (bicarbonate), and CO3\n2- (carbonate ion), and seawater pH \n\ncontrols the relative proportion of the different components (Kroopnick, 1985). Biological \n\nprimary production in the euphotic zone, when producers take up nutrients and carbon \n\n(photosynthesis), strongly fractionates stable carbon isotopes concentrating the light isotope \n\n12C in organic matter, and enriching superficial water in 13C (Freeman and Hayes, 1992), as \n\nrecorded by shallow dwelling planktonic foraminifera. Deeper in the water column, the 12C-\n\nrich organic matter is oxidized and remineralized, adding nutrients, and carbon with low \n\n13C/12C, to deep waters (Duplessy et al., 1984). As a result of these processes, nutrients and \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n31 \n\n?13C of DIC are generally negatively correlated, and nutrient-rich southern sourced water \n\nmasses like AAIW, CDW and AABW have relatively low ?13C values, while nutrient-poor \n\nNADW shows high ?13C values (Kroopnick, 1985). High nutrient concentrations and low \n\n?13C in AABW, for example, reflect the longer time these waters have spent away from the \n\nsurface, collecting nutrients and 13C-poor carbon from the decay of organic matter transported \n\nto abyssal depths in particulate and dissolved forms.  \n\nThe ?13C in surface waters is also influenced by air-sea gas exchange, which is favored \n\nin cold, windy regions (Broecker and Maier Reimer, 1992), such as the Subantarctic Frontal \n\nZone. 13C enrichment of dissolved CO2 in surface seawater results from the temperature-\n\ndependent fractionation of 13C/12C during the exchange of CO2 at the water atmosphere \n\ninterface (Mook et al., 1974). Colder waters display a larger fractionation and higher ?13C \n\nvalues for DIC. Gas exchange rates also depend on wind mixing in the surface ocean with \n\nstronger winds allowing the ?13C of DIC in seawater to equilibrate with the atmosphere. \n\nOwing to substantial exchange of CO2 between the atmosphere and the cold surface waters of \n\nthe Southern Ocean, the present-day AAIW, for instance, is more enriched in ?13C by ~1\u2030 \n\nthan would be expected on the basis of its nutrient content and biological productivity \n\n(Ninnemann and Charles, 1997; Ninnemann and Charles, 2002). \n\nThe applicability of ?13C of benthic foraminifera is relatively limited by the scarce \n\nknowledge about the complex effects of ecological, biogeochemical and physical parameters. \n\nTherefore, the comparison of the ?13C signal of different species should consider differences \n\nin metabolism and calcification rate of the organisms, namely species-specific vital effects. In \n\naddition, the ?13C composition of the test carbonate varies with the microhabitat of different \n\nspecies reflecting ?13C gradients of DIC in the pore water (Schmiedl and Mackensen, 2006). \n\nSpecies-specific vital effects in the ?13C signal are caused by differential incorporation \n\nof 13C-depleted metabolic CO2 into the test carbonate (e.g., Erez, 1978). Epifaunal taxa \n\ncommonly calcify close to the isotopic signature of bottom water ?13CDIC, whereas infaunal \n\ntaxa bear a pore water signal which is marked by 13C depletion (Corliss, 1985; Fontanier et \n\nal., 2006). Among genera of benthic foraminifera, the epifaunal Cibicidoides and Planulina \n\nseem to record the bottom water ?13CDIC most reliably (Duplessy et al., 1984; Schmiedl and \n\nMackensen, 2006), although negative deviations in the ?13C values are possible as response to \n\nphytodetritus pulses in regions of very high productivity (Mackensen et al., 1993).  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n32 \n\nThe infaunal Uvigerina peregrina preferentially occupies the uppermost surface \n\ncentimeter, and commonly approaches precipitation in equilibrium with ?18O (e.g., Schmiedl \n\net al., 2004), allowing its use as substitute for the Cibicidoides genera. According to \n\n(Schmiedl and Mackensen, 2006) average metabolic effects amount to \u20130.6\u2030 for \n\nCibicidoides wuellerstorfi and 0.0\u2030 for Uvigerina peregrina in relationship with bottom \n\nwaters ?18O.  \n\nThe assessment of metabolic effects in the ?13C signal of taxa from different \n\nmicrohabitats on and within the sediment is hampered by the dominance of environmental \n\nfactors including gradients between ?13CDIC and CO3\n2- in pore water and near-surface \n\nsediment, controlled by remineralization of organic matter (McCorkle et al., 1990; Schmiedl \n\net al., 2004). Schmiedl and Mackensen (2006) calculated the ?13C differences between \n\nepifauna (C. wuellerstorfi) and shallow infauna (U. peregrina) between 0.16 and 1.35\u2030 in \n\nthe Arabian Sea and interpreted them as changes in organic carbon (Corg) oxidation rates of \n\nbottom waters. Also, in that study, intervals of maximum deepwater oxygenation coincided \n\nwith high benthic foraminiferal diversity and were interpreted as increased admixture of well-\n\noxygenated deepwater masses close to the ocean floor. \n\nThe 441 samples stored in microfossil slides were sent for ?18O and ?13C analysis at the \n\nStable Isotopes Laboratory at the MARUM - Center for Marine Environmental Sciences, \n\nUniversity of Bremen, Germany. \n\nStable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios were measured on a Finnigan MAT 253 gas \n\nisotope ratio mass spectrometer with Kiel IV automated carbonate preparation device. The \n\ninstrument was calibrated using the in house standard (Solnhofen limestone), itself calibrated \n\nagainst the NBS 18 and NBS 19 standard reference materials. Standards and replicate \n\nanalyses are performed to avoid drift in the machine and bias in the results through \n\ncontamination as well as to assess the machine precision and accuracy. The data are reported \n\nin the usual delta-notation against Vienna-PDB. The standard deviations (reproducibility) for \n\nrepeated measurements of the in house standard were 0.03\u2030 for ?13C and 0.07\u2030 for ?18O. \n\nIce volume corrections were done for our Cibicidoides spp. ?18O (?18Oc) and U. \n\nperegrina ?18O (?18Ou) records (corrected records shown only on the discussion, subsection \n\n6.2). Corrections were calculated considering 1.00\u2030 as the global average change in ?18O of \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n33 \n\nseawater due to ice volume (Schrag et al., 2002) distributed in time according to the  \n\n(Lambeck and Chappell, 2001, updated in 2007) relative sea level data. \n\n4.2.5. Fe/Ca and Ti/Ca ratios in oceanic basins as paleoclimatological proxies / Raz\u00f5es \n\nFe/Ca e Ti/Ca como indicadores paleoclim\u00e1ticos  \n\nTerrigenous materials deposited off the tropical and subtropical Atlantic South \n\nAmerican coast are delivered to the ocean via fluvial pathways, which are highly sensitive to \n\nclimate change. High concentrations of terrigenous elements and low Ca concentrations along \n\nthe tropical and subtropical South American and African continental margins reflect the \n\ndominance of terrigenous input in these regions (Govin et al., 2012). A number of studies \n\nhave used major element composition of marine sediment cores to trace changes in \n\nterrigenous input into the Atlantic. In the last decade, the number of studies focusing on the \n\nSouth American Margin increased significantly (Arz et al., 1998; Arz et al., 1999; Peterson et \n\nal., 2000; Haug et al., 2001; Jaeschke et al., 2007; Chiessi et al., 2010). Yet, the 23-7\u00baS sector \n\nof the Brazilian continental margin remains completely void of studies. This is a particularly \n\nrelevant sector of the continental margin for reconstructing the strength of the SACZ and the \n\nSASM (see section 2.1.2).  \n\nThe late advances of this field come as a result of the relatively recent development of \n\nX-ray fluorescence (XRF) core scanners that can obtain nondestructive, almost continuous \n\nand relatively fast measurements of the intensities of major elements directly at the surface of \n\nsediment cores. Its results are usually presented in count rates or intensity of elements, which \n\ncan be calibrated into element concentrations using further Energy Dispersive X-Ray \n\nFluorescence (EDP-XRF) discrete geochemical analysis and an algorithm by (Weltje and \n\nTjallingii, 2008). \n\nFe and Ti within marine sediment cores can be used as tracers of the siliciclastic \n\ncomponents of terrestrial sediments, and vary proportionally to the terrigenous fraction in the \n\nsea floor, whereas Ca in this setting is largely derived from biogenic CaCO3 shell material \n\n(mostly pteropods, foraminifera, and calcareous nannoplankton; Govin et al., 2012). Some \n\nstudies of marine sediments (i.e., Govin et al., 2012) have suggested that single element \n\nconcentrations are sensitive to dilution effects (i.e., enhanced biological productivity, \n\ncarbonate dissolution) to allow reliable reconstructions of terrestrial climate, which can also \n\naffect elemental ratios including Ca (e.g., Fe/Ca). Therefore, in an area where post \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n34 \n\ndepositional carbonate dissolution and/or overgrowth are negligible or ruled out, elemental \n\nratios including Ca (e.g., Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca) can be used to discuss marine versus terrigenous \n\ninput.  \n\nFe/Ca and Ti/Ca ratios have hence been used to trace changes in terrigenous input of \n\nfluvial origin, particularly offshore northeastern Brazil, where repeated authors pointed out \n\nincreases in the terrigenous input during Heinrich events due to southward shifts of the ITCZ \n\n(Arz et al., 1998; Arz et al., 1999; Jennerjahn et al., 2004; Jaeschke et al., 2007; Nace et al., \n\n2014; Str\u00edkis et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015). \n\nThe archive halves of GeoB3227-2 and GeoB3228-1 were scanned for Fe, Ti and Ca \n\nusing an X-ray fluorescence (XRF) Core Scanner II (AVAATECH Serial No. 2, 10kV, and \n\n0.35 mA) at the MARUM \u2013 Center for Marine Environmental Sciences, University of \n\nBremen, Germany. Prior and after daily analysis, the instrument was calibrated against a set \n\nof pressed powder standards (Jansen et al., 1998). The elements\u2019 intensity or counts were \n\ndetermined at 5 mm intervals with 20 seconds of irradiation time directly over the pristine \n\nsurface of the archive halves of the cores. Acquired XRF spectra were processed with the \n\nWinAxil and WinBatch software packages. The resulting data were expressed as element \n\nintensities in counts per second. \n\n4.2.6. Calibration of XRF-scanner data via EDP-XRF / Calibra\u00e7\u00e3o de dados de scanner \n\nde XRF via EDP-XRF \n\nFe, Ti and Ca absolute concentrations were measured using EDP-XRF on a Panalytical \n\nEpsilon 3X spectrometer. Analytical quality of the measurements were assessed by repeated \n\nanalysis of several different certified standard reference materials (e.g. MAG-1; Govindaraju \n\net al., 1994). The measured values were within 1% of accepted values. The standard deviation \n\nof replicated sediment samples was less than 2%. The elements concentrations are expressed \n\nin grams per kilogram (g/kg) of dry sediment.

Unfortunately, since the ages around ~50 cm in both gravity cores were \n\nanomalous it was not possible to estimate sedimentation rates for the shallowest section of \n\nthese cores. Thus, GeoB3227-2 covers the period between 11.9 ka (200 cm) to 31.2 ka (556 \n\ncm - estimated with linear extrapolation of the sedimentation rate), and GeoB3228-1 covers \n\nthe period between 12.25 ka (158 cm) and 41 ka (548cm). \n\n ?18O and ?13C of benthic foraminifera / ?18O e ?13C de foramin\u00edferos \n\nbent\u00f4nicos  \n\nTo evaluate Cibicidoides spp. isotopic values and species specific isotopic offsets, \n\nFigure 5.2 shows ?18O and ?13C of all samples from the uppermost half of GeoB3228-1 \n\ndivided by species. \n\nIn Figure 5.2, ?13C values of Cibicidoides spp. are distributed scatteredly through the Y \n\naxis. This scattering can be explained by the fact that Cibicidoides spp. is composed by a \n\nvariable mixture of different Cibicidoides and Cibicides species with different species specific \n\noffsets, notably C. subhaidingerii (Holbourn et al., 2002) one of the most abundant \n\n(apparently) epibenthic species in the uppermost half of GeoB3228-1. In their work, Holbourn \n\net al. (2002), found that a heavily calcified test morphotype described as C. subhaidingerii \n\nalpha shows lower values of ?13C (0.5\u20131\u2030) when compared with C. subhaidingerii beta and \n\nPlanulina wuellerstorfi / C. wuellerstorfi, plotting closer to values of U. peregrina. Within \n\nour record nevertheless, ?13C of C. subhaidingerii presents ?13C values around 2\u2030 lower than \n\nC. wuellerstorfi samples and between 0.7-1\u2030 lower than U. peregrina. ?18O of C. \n\nsubhaidingerii was also found consistently higher than Planulina wuellerstorfi / C. \n\nwuellerstorfi (~0.65\u2030) and closer to U. peregrina values. Explaining also why the ?13C \n\nvalues of ~1000m deep water for the Holocene and LGM published by Curry and Oppo \n\n(2005) are higher than our record, closer to C. wuellerstorfi isotopic values (Figure 5.2). \n\nTherefore, when integrating isotopic results from the whole marine sediment core, we decided \n\nto exclude the data of all Cibicidoides spp. samples that contained C. subhaidingerii of our \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n38 \n\nrecord (43 out of the 61 samples from the selected time window from 12 to 41 ka). The \n\nepibenthic ?18O and ?13C values showed in Figures 5.3 and 5.4 include the results of the 17 \n\nremaining samples of Cibicidoides spp. along with the monospecific results of C. \n\nwuellerstorfi, C. pachyderma and Cibicides spp.. Intervals of more than 2 kyr without \n\nCibicidoides values were left as gaps. \n\nGiven that the age reversals coincided with the reddish layer, an unusual scattering on \n\n?13C and ?18O data and also a Fe/Ca anomaly (see section 5.3) we decided, for the moment, \n\nnot to interpret the records until the bottom of the reddish layer (i.e., 150 cm core depth). \n\nAlso, as our results were unevenly spaced in time and to preserve the timing of isotopic \n\nvariability, we used the integrated interpolation function embedded on the Analyseries 2.0.8 \n\nsoftware every 1 kyr (Figures 5.3 and 5.4). Within the studied time window (12 to 41 ka), the \n\nreservoir ?18O changed considerably because of expansion and retraction of global ice \n\nvolume. However, a recent paper (i.e., Lund et al., 2015) argues against the use of ice volume \n\ncorrections in benthic foraminiferal data because of depth-dependent timing in the evolution \n\nof melt water ?18O signal, potentially yielding artificially large increases in temperature on ice \n\nvolume corrected benthic foraminifera ?18O. We therefore define the deglacial temperature \n\nincrease using non-corrected data, and plot ice volume corrected data (?18Ocivc and ?\n18Ouivc) \n\nonly for visual comparison in the discussion.  \n\nU. peregrina ?13C record begins with values around -0.7\u2030 at 41.5 ka and decrease to -\n\n0.95\u2030 at 39 ka, the approximate timing of Heinrich stadial 4 (Figure 5.3). It increases by \n\n0.3\u2030 after the event, locally peaking at 37 ka. After that ?13C follows a decreasing trend \n\nreaching a minimum at 30 ka (-1.2\u2030). Until 22 ka, ?13C values oscillate around -1.1\u2030 \n\nwithout increasing or decreasing trends. ?13C values increase to -0.9\u2030 around 20 ka, \n\ndecreasing again to -1.15\u2030 at 17 ka. From this point ?13C consistently increases until values \n\nreach the records maximum around 13 ka (0\u2030). The remaining 0.75 kyr of our record is \n\nmarked by a slight decrease of -0.1\u2030. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n39   \n\nFigure 5.2: Benthic foraminiferal stable oxygen and carbon isotopic records for the uppermost half \n\nof marine sediment core GeoB3228-1, divided by species.

W / 1108 m, Curry and Oppo, \n\n2005).  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n42 \n\nCibicidoides spp. ?13C record presents, as expected, a 13C enriched record in \n\nrelationship to the U. peregrina (Figure 5.3). The difference or offset between ?13Cc and ?\n13Cu \n\n(??13C) oscillated up to 0.9\u2030 (?offset) within our record, from 0.7\u2030 around 12 ka (minimum \n\n??13C) and 1.6\u2030 between 20 and 30 ka (maximum ??13C). The ?13Cc record begins with \n\nvalues around 0.5\u2030 at 41 ka, which increase to 0.65\u2030 at between 40 and 38 ka, during the \n\napproximate duration of HS4. ?13C values decrease to 0.4\u2030 in the period between 36 and 33 \n\nka and increase again to 0.6\u2030 until 30 ka (around HS3). For the next 9 kyr the values follow \n\na decreasing trend reaching 0.4\u2030 at 21 ka. From this point until 18 ka, ?13C values decrease \n\nto the record\u2019s minimum of 0.2\u2030, remaining low between 19 and 18 ka, right before values \n\nbegin a steady rise until 14 ka. At 14 ka values reach the record\u2019s maximum of 1\u2030. From this \n\npeak onwards ?13C values decrease until 0.8\u2030, at 12.25 ka. \n\nU. peregrina ?18O record can be divided in two domains. From the beginning of the \n\nrecord at 41.5 to 17 ka, the values have a general increasing trend varying between 4\u2030 and \n\n4.65\u2030, the record\u2019s maximum. An exception to the decreasing trend is found at 29 ka, \n\nrepresented by an 0.2\u2030 increase, just after HS3. From 17 ka until the end of the record, ?18O \n\nsteadily decrease, interrupted only by a 0.1\u2030 excursion to higher values between 14 and 13 \n\nka. The record\u2019s minimum, 3.65\u2030, is reached at the younger limit of our studied time period, \n\nat 12 ka. \n\nCibicidoides spp. ?18O record follows a similar trend of U. peregrina ?18O, beginning at \n\n3.3\u2030 at 41 ka, and adopting a general increasing trend until 18 ka (4.2\u2030), 1 kyr after U. \n\nperegrina ?18O peaked. From 18 ka until the end of the record, ?18O values steadily decrease \n\nuntil the record\u2019s minimum, 2.7\u2030, at 12 ka. Cibicidoides spp. ?18O values exhibit offset of \n\n0.6\u2030 in relationship with U. peregrina (Holbourn et al., 2002). It is noteworthy that the \n\nHolocene and LGM ?18O (for ~1000m water depth) values published by Curry and Oppo \n\n(2005; Figure 5.4) fit very well our Cibicidoides spp. record (without C. subhaidingerii data). \n\nThis shows that our ?18O record is replicable and coherent with other nearby published \n\noxygen isotopic records.  \n\n Major elements in bulk sediment / Elementos maiores em sedimento total \n\nWe show ln(Fe/Ca) and ln(Ti/Ca), traditional element ratios usually employed to \n\ndiscuss variations of terrigenous input into oceanic basins (e.g., Arz et al., 1998; Jennerjahn et \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n43 \n\nal., 2004; Govin et al., 2012), that should be closely related to effective moisture on the \n\nadjacent continent (Figure 5.5).  \n\nThe EDP-XRF absolute concentrations were used to calibrate the scanner XRF \n\nintensities into calibrated proportions using the regression method described by Weltje and \n\nTjallingii (2008) implemented in the software MATLAB. \n\nFe/Ca and Ti/Ca log-ratios are very similar within each core. GeoB3228-1 log-ratios are \n\nrelatively stable from 42 to 37 ka, slightly increase until 20 ka and decrease subtly from that \n\nage to 15.85 ka. At 15.85 ka the log ratios decrease sharply, showing decrease in Fe and Ti in \n\nrelationship with Ca and the records\u2019 minimum is reached at 13.6 ka. After 13.6 ka the \n\nterrigenous fraction increases again until 12 ka, when log ratios reach previous than 15.85 ka \n\nvalues. Within the period between 12 and 4.3 ka we find the highest ratios. This portion of the \n\ncore corresponds with the reddish layer and contains the age reversal observed on section \n\n4.2.1 (Figure 5.5). From 4.3 ka to the core top at 3.2 ka ln(Fe/Ca) and ln(Ti/Ca) assume \n\nrelatively low values.  \n\nThe EDP-XRF ln(Ti/Ca) and ln(Fe/Ca) used for scanner-XRF calibration show almost \n\nperfect fit to the calibrated values with little divergence on the oldest portion of the records, \n\nbefore 31ka. \n\nThe shorter GeoB3227-2 ln(Ti/Ca) and ln(Fe/Ca) records show a similar trend to the \n\none described for GeoB3228-1. The oldest half of the record, from 31 to 14.7 ka is plateau-\n\nshaped with relatively low amplitude oscillations. At 14.7 ka onwards there\u2019s an abrupt \n\ndecrease of log-ratios values until 13.7 ka, when they are at their lowest from that point to \n\n13.1 ka. At 13.1 ka Ti and Fe proportions in relationship to Ca sharply increase and at 12.6 ka \n\nthey return to previous than 14.7 ka values. From 12.6 to 11.6 ka terrigenous proportions \n\nremain relatively stable. From 11.6 ka onwards it\u2019s possible to observe the same increase in \n\nterrigenous in relationship to (marine) Ca seen on GeoB3228-1. These values are also \n\ncoincident with the reddish sediments layer and the age reversal showed in Figure 5.5 of the \n\nprevious section. The youngest portion of the records (estimated age from 3.5 to 0.5 ka) also \n\npresent relatively low log-ratios values as seen in GeoB3228-1.      \n\nThe discussion about our Fe/Ca and Ti/Ca results can be found on section 5 of the paper  \n\n\u201cSouth American summer monsoon decreased intensity related to the B\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d \n\ninterstadial\u201d (Catunda et al., in prep.), attached to this dissertation.   \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n44 \n\n  \n\nFigure 5.5: Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca records from cores GeoB3228-1 (a and b, respectively) and \n\nGeoB3227-2 (c and d, respectively).

Discussion / Discuss\u00e3o \n\n Sedimentation on the core sites on the passage between the late \n\nPleistocene and Holocene / Sedimenta\u00e7\u00e3o no local dos testemunhos \n\nmarinhos durante a passagem Pleistoceno tardio e Holoceno \n\nToday, sediment and water discharged from the Doce River are entrained in the Brazil \n\nCurrent and accumulate on the continental shelf closer to the river mouth (Bastos et al., 2015). \n\nDuring sea-level lowstand of the last glacial period, however, the Doce River mouth was \n\nlocated below the shelf break depth and the river channel incised the continental shelf and \n\ndischarged directly into the upper continental slope. As the sea level rose during the last \n\ndeglaciation, and overcame the shelf break (~65m water depth, Bastos et al., 2015) the low \n\nangle of the continental platform implied that the Doce River mouth shifted significantly \n\naway from the study site with every additional increment of sea level rise (Figure 6.1, \n\nLambeck and Chappell, 2001, updated in 2007).  \n\nFigure 6.1: Relative sea level (Lambeck and Chappel, 2001; updated in 2007) and \n\nln(Fe/Ca) of GeoB3228-1 and GeoB3227-2 versus age.

The grey rectangle marks the \n\nportion of the gravity cores that was deposited after the sea level overcame the local shelf \n\nbreak (plotted at 65m water depth).  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n47 \n\nWe hypothesize that when sea level overcame the shelf break (~12 ka) our study site \n\nbecame starved of terrigenous sediments, receiving rather occasional input from the adjacent \n\ncontinental shelf brought by slumps or turbidity currents. Sediments previously deposited in \n\nthe Doce River plataform are simultaneously iron-rich, because of Doce River sediments, and \n\nrelatively calcium-poor, because of the shallow depths in which it is located, possibly \n\nexplaining the high Fe/Ca and Ti/Ca ratios in the reddish layers. Our hypothesis justifies the \n\nexclusion of the data obtained from the holocenic reddish layers containing age reversals on \n\nthe studied cores.  \n\n Changes in southern sourced water masses isotopic signature in the \n\nwestern South Atlantic during the late glacial and Termination I \n\nCurrently GeoB3228-1 core site is bathed by UCDW. During the LGM however, our \n\nstudy depth in the western South Atlantic has been reported to be within the Glacial Antarctic \n\nIntermediate Water (GAAIW) depth interval, between 850 and 1200 m (Curry and Oppo, \n\n2005; Makou et al., 2010; Tessin and Lund, 2013). AAIW and UCDW are both formed \n\naround Antarctica and have similar physical properties, being relatively fresh and nutrient rich \n\n(see Figures 2.2 and 4.4) in relationship to NADW, for example. To establish a relationship \n\nbetween GAAIW and the global climatic evolution, considering that AAIW is formed close to \n\nAntarctica, we compared our ?18O and ?13C results with temperature and CO2 data from \n\nAntarctic ice cores (Parrenin et al., 2013, Figure 6.2, and Bereiter et al., 2015, Figure 6.3).  \n\nAs previously mentioned in subsection 4.2.4, benthic foraminiferal ?18O is a function of \n\nboth temperature and the ?18O of the water in which the foraminifera grows (Epstein and \n\nMayeda, 1953), which is in turn affected by changes in salinity and global ice volume \n\n(Waelbroeck et al., 2002). After corrections for global ice volume however, even though \n\ncalcitic ?18O is affected by the interplay of temperature and salinity, the former dominates the \n\nequilibrium ?18O values in the deep ocean (Curry and Oppo, 2005). We therefore interpret \n\n?18O of benthic foraminifera in terms of temperature and global ice volume oscillations \n\n(Figure 6.2). \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n48 \n\n \n\nFigure 6.2: (a) Ice volume corrected Cibicidoides ?18O composite interpolated every 1kyr (light blue line); (b) C. wuellerstorfi (cyan circles), \n\nC. pachyderma (purple circles), Cibicides spp. (green circles) and Cibicidoides spp. (gray squares, samples containing C. subhaidingerii were \n\nexcluded) ?18O record and 1 kyr integrated interpolation (blue line); (c) Ice volume corrected U. peregrina ?18O record interpolated every 1kyr \n\n(grayish blue line) (d) U. peregrina (upside down gray triangles) ?18O record and 1 kyr integrated interpolation (navy blue line); (e) Antarctic \n\ntemperature stack from five different ice cores (EDC, Vostok, Dome Fuji, TALDICE, and EDML, Parrenin et al., 2013). Black circles \n\nrepresent AMS 14C ages in cal kyr BP with respective 2? sigma uncertainty bars. Red crosses represent ?18O of the geographically and depth \n\nclosest, from the study site, for Holocene and Last Glacial Maximum (marine sediment core KNR159-105JPC, 27.35? S / 46.63? W / 1108 m, \n\nCurry and Oppo, 2005). Heinrich Stadials from 1 to 4 are highlighted with gray rectangles (Sarnthein et al., 2001). \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n49 \n\nOverall, likely due to higher resolution and species consistency our U. peregrina ?18O \n\n(?18Ou and ?\n18Ouivc, when referred to ice volume corrected data) and U. peregrina ?\n\n13C (?13Cu) \n\nrecords reflected Antarctic temperature and CO2 evolution better than their Cibicidoides \n\ncounterparts (?18Oc and ?\n18Ocivc, when referred to ice volume corrected data, and ?\n\n13Cc). As an \n\nexample, on ?18Oc, the marked deglacial ?\n18O decrease began before than in the ?18Ou record, \n\nat 18ka. However, between 20 and 16 ka, the ?18Oc record was defined only by 4 samples of \n\nmixed Cibicidoides species, and therefore we decided to base our conclusions regarding ?18O \n\non the ?18Ou record.  \n\nAlthough the Antarctic temperature composite (Figure 6.2; Parrenin et al., 2013) shows \n\nseveral relatively small temperature oscillations between 42 ka and 27 ka, the only oscillation \n\nconsistently found on our ?18O records within this time window is a 1.1\u00b0C increase in \n\nAntarctica during HS3 (at 29.9 ka, pink arrow on Figure 6.2). Contemporaneously, our high \n\nresolution ?18Ou registered an ~ 0.32 \u2030 decrease (pink arrow on Figure 6.2). Considering that \n\nevery ~ 0.25 \u2030 represents around a 1\u00b0C change in cold waters (Marchitto et al., 2014), the \n\n?18Ou 0.32 \u2030 decrease would be equivalent to a 1.25\u00b0C warming in GAAIW but centered at \n\n29.0 ka, with a ~900 years delay. The warming of GAAIW during HS3 could be linked to an \n\nslowdown of the AMOC described by B\u00f6hm et al. (2015) and a consequent long term \n\naccumulation of heat in the Southern Ocean or due to warming of GAAIW at its area of \n\nformation.  \n\nThe most notable change in all ?18O records was the expressive ?18O decrease during \n\nthe HS1 (red arrow on Figure 6.2). On our high resolution ?18Ou record the deglacial decrease \n\ntook place at 17 ka, in accordance with other related studies in western South Atlantic \n\n(Waelbroeck et al., 2011; Lund et al., 2015). Most of the global deglacial warming happened \n\nduring the HS1, when temperatures in Antarctica rose around 2 \u00b0C/kyr from 17.7 to 14.7 ka \n\n(Parrenin et al., 2013). ?18Ou also shows a 0.1 \u2030 increase between 14.0 and 12.6 ka,, which \n\ncan be related with the 1.5\u00b0C temperature decrease in Antarctica during the Antarctic Cold \n\nReversal (14.6 to 12.65 ka, Figure 6.2, Blunier et al., 1997; Stenni et al., 2001).  \n\nForaminiferal calcite ?13C usually reflects a combination of several factors, markedly \n\nthe ones related to nutrient cycling and isotopic fractioning at the oceanic surface due to air-\n\nsea CO2 exchange (?\n13Cas, see subsection 4.2.4). Biological primary production in the \n\neuphotic zone concentrates 12C in organic matter, enriching superficial water in 13C. Deeper in \n\nthe water column, the 12C-rich organic matter is oxidized and remineralized, adding carbon \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n50 \n\nwith low ?13C to deep waters (Duplessy et al., 1984). Air-sea fractionation at cold \n\ntemperatures cause 13C enrichment in seawater, while warmer temperatures lead to 13C \n\nisotopic depletion and reduced ?13Cas values (Mook et al., 1974). Also, for comparisons \n\nbetween the LGM and modern ?13C values Duplessy et al. (1988) calculated an 0.3 \u2030 ?13C \n\ndepletion during the glacial for the whole ocean. Peterson et al. (2014) updated this number to \n\n0.38 \u2030 and suggested that this global oceanic water ?13C decrease during the last glacial \n\nperiod was likely due to terrestrial carbon transfer to the deep ocean as originally proposed by \n\nShackleton (1977)  \n\nCurry and Oppo (2005) at 27\u00baS and during the LGM, characterized GAAIW as a high-\n\nnutrient water mass with ?13Cc values between 0.3 and 0.5\u2030. Makou et al. (2010) combined \n\nthe ?13Cc from Curry and Oppo (2005) with Cd/Ca measurements and calculated the \n\natmospheric contribution to GAAIW ?13C (?13Cas) as 0.23\u2030 (between 899 and 1108 water \n\ndepth) during the LGM, which would represent between 45% and 75% of the total GAAIW \n\n?13C signal. Makou et al. (2010) also noted that there was a steeper gradient between GAAIW \n\nand SACW than with GNAIW, suggesting a greater degree of mixing with the deeper water \n\nmass. Correspondent core top data presented ?13Cas of 1.22\u2030, which implied that GAAIW \n\napparently had a significantly lower air-sea fractioning contribution in comparison to the \n\nmodern AAIW (Makou et al., 2010). Other results from the Pacific and Indian sectors of \n\nGAAIW, however, exhibited much higher ?13Cas values than the ones observed in the \n\nAtlantic, suggesting enhanced ventilation of GAAIW in those regions during the LGM \n\n(Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 1994; Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 1996; Muratli et al., 2010). This apparent \n\ncontradiction led Makou et al. (2010) to hypothesize that connectivity between the different \n\nsections of the Southern Ocean was restricted during the LGM and that their calculated \n\nGAAIW ?13Cas values were specific to the South Atlantic. Later on Huang et al. (2014) used \n\n?Nd from unclean foraminifera, from a marine sediment core section at 10?N, to infer \n\ndecreased latitudinal extent of GAAIW and increased mixture between GAAIW and GNAIW \n\nduring the northern hemispheric cold periods HS1 and YD. The combination between their \n\n?Nd and \n231Pa/230Th (McManus et al., 2004) showed that the decreased GAAIW latitudinal \n\nextent was associated with decreased AMOC strength, which therefore gave support for \n\ndecreased GAAIW ventilation during the LGM and potential ventilation seesawing between \n\nPacific and Atlantic sectors of GAAIW (Makou et al., 2010).  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n51 \n\nFigure 6.3: (a) C. wuellerstorfi (cyan circles), C. pachyderma (purple circles), Cibicides spp. (green circles) and Cibicidoides spp. (gray \n\ndiamonds, samples containing C. subhaidingerii were excluded) ?13C record and 1 kyr integrated interpolation (light green line); (b) U. \n\nperegrina (gray crosses) ?13C record and 1 kyr integrated interpolation (dark green line); (c) Antarctic composite ice core atmospheric CO2 \n\ndata (WAIS, Siple Dome and TALDICE, Bereiter et al., 2015 and references therein).

Red crosses represent the geographically and depth closest, ?13C values for Holocene and Last Glacial \n\nMaximum of marine sediment core KNR159-105JPC (27.35? S / 46.63?

Expected range of ?13C values (0.3-0.5\u2030 for GAAIW during the \n\nLGM, Curry and Oppo, 2005) are marked with a light blue rectangle. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n52 \n\nOur ?13Cc composite data are consistent with GAAIW ?\n13C expected values for the \n\nLGM (between 0.3 and 0.5 \u2030, Curry and Oppo, 2005; Figure 6.3). Notable exceptions, when \n\n?13Cc was not between the 0.3 to 0.5\u2030 range, were during HS4, HS3 and before HS1. \n\nBetween 37.6 and 41 ka, within the HS4 defined time range (Sarnthein et al., 2000), ?13Cc \n\nvalues were relatively higher (~0.65 \u2030), which could be explained by several hypothesis: \n\ndiminished productivity above in the water column, mixture with the higher ?13C bearer \n\nGNAIW, or a general increased air-sea fractionation and 13C-enrichment in GAAIW at its \n\nformation zone, because of decreased temperatures and/or decreased wind mixing. For this \n\nwork we have not analyzed planktic foraminifera, which would allow us to check for the \n\npossible productivity decrease during HS4 in the photic zone, so this possibility can only be \n\nresolved with future analysis. The Antarctic temperature composite temperature (Figure 6.2c, \n\n(Parrenin et al., 2013) shows that during the HS4, temperatures actually increased in \n\nAntarctica, deeming unlikely that the ~0.15 \u2030 ?13Cc increase (in relationship to 0.5\u2030 in ?\n13Cc \n\nduring the LGM and at 27?S, (Curry and Oppo, 2005) was associated to increased air-sea \n\nfractioning at GAAIW\u2019s formation zone.  \n\nCentered at 30.2 ka, within the HS3 time window (Sarnthein et al., 2000), ?13Cc was \n\nagain higher than the LGM expected range (~ 0.57 \u2030). Assuming that HS4 and HS3 ?13Cc \n\nincreases were both due to the same process, recognizing the lack of productivity data from \n\nplanktic foraminifera, as well as an unlikely ?13Cas enrichment during both HS, lead us to \n\nsuggest that our ?13Cc increases were due to higher mixture between southern and northern \n\ncomponent waters. This higher mixture rate implies decreased GAAIW formation at SH high \n\nlatitudes and is supported by reported decreased AMOC strength during NH cold events \n\n(Makou et al., 2010; B\u00f6hm et al., 2015; see Figure 2.4).  \n\nLower than expected ?13Cc values between 20 and 18 ka could indicate increased \n\nproductivity in the photic zone and 12C-rich detritus rainfall to the bottom of the water \n\ncolumn, which should be tested by future analysis in planktic foraminifera. Additionally, \n\ngiven that the three samples available for this interval are a mixture of Cibicidoides species \n\n(Cibicidoides spp.) any interpretation using our ?13Cc record during this period (20 to 18ka) \n\nshould consider possibly unaccounted species-specific offsets effects. In addition, the closest \n\n?13Cc available data, from marine sediment core KNR159-105JPC (27.35? S / 46.63? W / 1108 \n\nm water depth; Curry and Oppo, 2005), does not support a regional productivity increase \n\n(Figure 6.3 and other ?13Cc data from the Brazil Margin transect; Curry and Oppo, 2005; \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n53 \n\nMakou et al., 2010; Tessin and Lund, 2013). The ?13Cc ~ 0.6 \u2030 increase during HS1 began \n\nbetween 18 and 17 ka, in accordance with other published data in the Brazil Margin (Tessin \n\nand Lund, 2013). This long standing ?13Cc increase is probably related to the combination of \n\nseveral factors, among them increased mixture with higher ?13C waters (related with AMOC \n\nquasi-halt during HS1; McManus et al., 2004; B\u00f6hm et al., 2015), increased atmospheric \n\npCO2 at the formation zone of GAAIW (Marcott et al., 2014; Bereiter et al., 2015) and \n\nisotopic adjustment for the global oceanic water ?13C increase since the last glacial (Peterson \n\net al., 2014). \n\nThere have been several suggestions that AAIW/GAAIW could have been a carrier for \n\n14C and 13C-depleted abyssal waters that contributed for global 40 ppm CO2 rise during the \n\n\u201cMystery Interval\u201d (~17.5 to 14.5 ka; Broecker and Barker, 2007; Marchitto et al., 2007). \n\nSortor (2012) investigated the ?14C of GAAIW during the deglaciation and found however \n\nthat it followed the atmospheric trend, excluding Atlantic section of GAAIW as a possible \n\ncarrier for the 14C-depleted carbon that contributed for the large atmospheric warming during \n\nHS1 (Broecker and Barker, 2007; Parrenin et al., 2013). \n\nU. peregrina ?13C (?13Cu) are usually of difficult interpretation because the assessment \n\nof its metabolic effects (i.e., species specific offset) in the ?13C signal is hampered by the \n\ndominance of locally specific environmental factors, including gradients between ?13CDIC and \n\nCO3\n2- in pore water and near-surface sediment, controlled by remineralization of organic \n\nmatter (McCorkle et al., 1990; Schmiedl et al., 2004). Zahn et al. (1986) showed that ?13C \n\nvalues for U. peregrina and C. wuellerstorfi did not run parallel over the past glacial-\n\ninterglacial cycles, which was also described in several other studies (e.g., Elmore et al., \n\n2015). Species of the Cibicidoides genera usually live on top of the sediment (epibenthic), \n\nthereby accurately recording the conditions of the bottom water. Species of the Uvigerina \n\ngenera, however, live in the sediment (endobenthic) and its ?13C signal usually reflects the \n\nconditions of the pore water, strongly influenced by the sedimentation of organic substance, \n\nrather than the true bottom water (Zahn et al., 1986). Therefore, U. peregrina ?13C cannot be \n\nadjusted to C. wuellerstorfi, the most reliable benthic recorder of bottom water ?13CDIC \n\n(Duplessy et al., 1984; Schmiedl and Mackensen, 2006) by any constant which is generally \n\nvalid through glacial and interglacial times. Elmore et al. (2015) calculated the offset between \n\nU. peregrina and Cibicidoides ?13C (??13C) within the Pacific sector of GAAIW and \n\nconcluded that it amounted to ~0.6\u2030 during interglacials and ~1.4\u2030 during glacials (?offset = \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n54 \n\n0.8\u2030 between glacials and interglacials), values which are consistent with our own data (see \n\nsection 5.2) .  \n\nNevertheless, our high-resolution ?13Cu record present good visual agreement with \n\nlong term trends observed in the ?13Cc composite (Figure 6.3).  On millennial time scales \n\nhowever, ?13Cu is decoupled from ?\n13Cc and do not show clear evidence of specific \n\noscillations that could be related with possible HS3 and HS4 AMOC decreased strength \n\n(B\u00f6hm et al., 2015). Hesse et al. (2014) summarized the magnitude of all known factors \n\nwhich influence ?13Cu and concluded that alkalinity, pH and productivity in the water column \n\nhad less impact on ?13Cu than the water ?\n13CDIC itself.  \n\nOur high resolution ?13Cu record presents a striking resemblance with variations on the \n\nAntarctic atmospheric CO2 record (Bereiter et al., 2015), showing a 900 years delay (r\n2=0.85 \n\nbetween Antarctic atmospheric CO2 and our ?\n13Cu, and r\n\n2=0.95 when comparing Antarctic \n\natmospheric CO2 with ?\n13Cu on its age model minus 900 years; Figure 6.4). Its most notable \n\nfeature is the 1.15 \u2030 ?13Cu increase from 17 to 13 ka. Since U. peregrina is usually \n\nconsidered to reflect pore water geochemistry and our ?13Cc supports the interpretation that \n\nGAAIW strength oscillated with AMOC slowdowns (which do not seem to impact our ?13Cu), \n\nthis resemblance creates a conundrum. We suggest that our ?13Cu is primarily recording the \n\nglobal oceanic 0.38 \u2030 ?13CDIC decrease during glacial times (Duplessy et al., 1988; Peterson \n\net al., 2014), in itself correlated with atmospheric CO2. Furthermore, we suggest that the \n\nremaining ~0.77 \u2030 (1.15 - 0.38 \u2030 ) ?13Cu increase registered between 17 and 13 ka is related \n\nto pore water geochemistry oscillations induced by the glacial to deglacial oceanic chemical \n\nchange (?offset = 0.9 \u2030 between 20 and 12 ka, see section 5.2).  \n\nPrimarily the atmospheric CO2 rise, the pore geochemistry variables of which ?offset is \n\nconsisted and the 0.38\u2030 global ocean carbon isotopic difference between glacial and \n\ninterglacial are likely related by a causal link, which not necessarily would be the Antarctic \n\nCO2 rise itself (a \n13C-depleated carbon release from an abyssal oceanic source would also \n\naffect all of them, for example). However, the timing with which our ?13Cu rose implies that at \n\nleast the Atlantic sector geochemical change between glacial and deglacial was almost 1 kyr \n\nlater than the Antarctic CO2 rise. Our data therefore, in agreement with the findings of Sortor \n\n(2012), does not support 13C-depleated degassing from an Atlantic abyssal source.  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n55 \n\nAlso, our results suggest that GAAIW ?13C changes potentially related with AMOC \n\nslowdowns did not impact pore water geochemistry at our study site. However we allow that \n\nour interpretations require further study to be confirmed. Next steps could be investigating \n\nother proxies, such as ?13C of planktic foraminifera and Cd/Ca, to distinguish between \n\npaleoproductivity and ?13Cas variations in our ?\n13Cc and ?\n\n13Cu records.  \n\n South American summer monsoon decreased intensity related to the \n\nB\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d interstadial / Diminui\u00e7\u00e3o da intensidade do Sistema de \n\nmon\u00e7\u00f5es de ver\u00e3o Sul Americano relacionado ao interestadial  B\u00f8lling-\n\nAller\u00f8d \n\nPlease refer to the attached manuscript \u201cSouth American summer monsoon decreased \n\nintensity related to the B\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d interstadial\u201d (Catunda et al., in prep.) for the \n\ndiscussion and conclusions on major elements in bulk sediments of the marine sediment core \n\nGeoB3228-1.  \n\n  \n\nFigure 6.4: Comparison between 1 kyr integrated interpolations of GeoB3228-1 U. peregrina ?13C \n\nrecord (light green line) and Antarctic composite ice core atmospheric CO2 data (red line, WAIS, \n\nSiple Dome and TALDICE, Bereiter et al., 2015 and references therein).

Conclusions / Conclus\u00f5es \n\n? AMOC slowdown potentially led to warming of GAAIW during HS3, which \n\ncan be explained by long term accumulation of heat in the Southern Ocean \n\nduring decreased AMOC strength scenario, which is supported by Cibicidoides \n\n?13C record, or due to warming of GAAIW at its area of formation.  \n\n? During HS4, AMOC slowdown may have led to increased mixture between \n\nGAAIW and GNAIW.  \n\n? We have no sign of an abyssal 13C-depleted carbon release in intermediate \n\nwaters of western South Atlantic during the deglaciation.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n57 \n\n8.

Previous studies have correlated pulses of increased terrigenous input off semi-5 \n\narid northeastern South America with abrupt cold events in the high latitudes of the 6 \n\nNorthern Hemisphere. However, deglacial climate changes in other areas of South America 7 \n\nare still not resolved. Here we reconstruct deglacial (23-11.5 cal ka BP) continental 8 \n\nconditions over eastern Brazil based on (i) Ti/Ca of a radiocarbon dated marine sediment 9 \n\ncore as a proxy for Doce River (draining eastern Brazil) terrigenous input, and (ii) ?18O of a 10 \n\nsuite of U-Th dated stalagmites from eastern Brazil. Our marine core was recovered from 11 \n\n1100 m water depth on the tropical Brazilian continental slope, while our stalagmites come 12 \n\nfrom Lapa Sem Fim Cave. Both the Doce River and Lapa Sem Fim Cave are located in the 13 \n\nhighly populated and economically active eastern Brazil, where most of the rainfall is 14 \n\nrelated to the activity of the South American Monsoon System (SAMS). The Ti/Ca record 15 \n\nis relatively stable, showing high proportions of Ti in relationship to Ca throughout the 16 \n\ndeglacial, with a major excursion towards lower values, indicating a decrease in terrigenous 17 \n\ninput, synchronous to the B\u00f8lling\u2013Aller\u00f8d. Interestingly, speleothem ?18O also displays this 18 \n\nmajor excursion, by recording less negative values. Together, our results suggest a major 19 \n\ndecrease in precipitation, likely related to a weakening of the SAMS. We further compared 20 \n\nour results with the output of the SYNTRACE run of the CCSM3 fully-coupled climate 21 \n\nmodel with transient forcing for the last deglaciation. Geochemical records and model 22 \n\noutput show consistent results and suggest that eastern Brazil experienced the driest period 23 \n\nof the whole last deglaciation during the B\u00f8lling\u2013Aller\u00f8d and that this dry spell was indeed 24 \n\nrelated to a decreased SAMS intensity. 25 \n\n  26 \n\n\n\n1. Introduction 27 \n\nHeinrich stadials (HS) impacted continental tropical climates mainly through 28 \n\nchanges in intensity of monsoon systems. In South America (SA), during these events, a 29 \n\nsignificant decrease in North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SST) shifted the 30 \n\nIntertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) location southwards, strengthening the South 31 \n\nAmerican Summer Monsoon (SASM) (Wang et al., 2004). Modeling efforts are consistent 32 \n\nwith the hypothesis that AMOC variations, and their effect on heat transport, hemispheric 33 \n\nSST patterns, and ITCZ position, can be invoked to explain the strong covariation observed 34 \n\nbetween Greenland and Cariaco Basin proxy records (e.g., Chiang and Friedman, 2012; 35 \n\nHughen et al., 1996; L. C. Peterson et al., 2000).  36 \n\nIn Brazil, the first study on the impact of millennial-scale abrupt events was (Arz et 37 \n\nal., 1999; 1998), based in terrigenous input and planktonic foraminifera ?18O off NE Brazil. 38 \n\nThey showed increased terrigenous input during Heinrich events due to a southward shift of 39 \n\nthe ITCZ. Terrigenous materials deposited off tropical and subtropical eastern SA are 40 \n\ndelivered to the ocean via fluvial pathways, which are highly sensitive to climate change 41 \n\n(Zhang et al., 2015). High concentrations of terrigenous elements and low calcium 42 \n\nconcentrations along the tropical and subtropical South American continental margins 43 \n\nreflect the dominance of terrigenous input in these regions (Govin et al., 2012). Since Arz 44 \n\net al. (1998), a number of studies have used major element composition of marine sediment 45 \n\ncores to trace changes in terrigenous input into the Atlantic (Arz et al., 1999; 1998; Bender 46 \n\net al., 2013; Chiessi et al., 2010; 2009; Govin et al., 2014; Haug et al., 2001; Jaeschke et al., 47 \n\n2007; L. C. Peterson et al., 2000; Str\u00edkis et al., 2015; Voigt et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2015). 48 \n\nYet, the 23-7\u00baS sector of the Brazilian continental margin remains completely void of 49 \n\nstudies. This is a particularly relevant sector of the continental margin for reconstructing the 50 \n\nstrength of the SASM and the South American Convergence Zone (SACZ), the transient 51 \n\nconvective system that transports Amazon moisture to central and southeastern SA (Figure 52 \n\n2) (Vera et al., 2006). 53 \n\nWithin the continent, stalagmite ?18O records from caves in southeastern SA related 54 \n\nnegative ?18O excursions with intensification in the SASM during Heinrich events (Cruz et 55 \n\nal., 2006; Str\u00edkis et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2007).  56 \n\nHere we use two previously unpublished data sets to discuss how global abrupt 57 \n\n\n\nclimate change events impacted central eastern South American climate during Termination 58 \n\n1. We combine a detailed stalagmite ?18O record from central South America with XRF-59 \n\nscanner and EDP-XRF data from a marine sediment core collected from the adjacent 60 \n\nwestern tropical South Atlantic, as well as with the output from a transient forcing model 61 \n\nrun to reconstruct continental climate conditions. Our records show that abrupt temperature 62 \n\noscillations in Greenland during the B\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d (BA) (Rasmussen et al., 2006) 63 \n\nhappened synchronously to changes in hydrological patterns in central South America. 64 \n\nMoreover, the B\u00f8lling and Aller\u00f8d events were related to decreased intensity of the SASM, 65 \n\nseparated by a brief wetter excursion, recognized as equivalent to the Older Dryas.  66 \n\n2. Regional setting 67 \n\nIn this paper we present a record of major elements from marine sediments from the 68 \n\nwestern South Atlantic and a speleothem stable isotope record from eastern South America. 69 \n\nThe marine site is located 105 km from the modern Brazilian coastline and 110 km of the 70 \n\ncurrent mouth of the Doce River, while the stalagmites used here were collected at Lapa 71 \n\nSem Fim Cave (Figure 1). 72 \n\nTerrigenous sediment at the marine core site (Figure 1) have been directly delivered 73 \n\nby the Doce River (Tintelnot, 1995; Tintelnot et al., 1998) during Late Pleistocene, when 74 \n\nthe river\u2019s mouth was located beyond the shelf break, locally between 60 and 70 m water 75 \n\ndepth (Bastos et al., 2015). Nowadays, most of the terrigenous material from the Doce 76 \n\nRiver is deposited at the continental shelf, but under pleistocenic low sea-level conditions, 77 \n\nthe terrigenous sediment was transported to the study site via one of the presently-drowned 78 \n\nchannels of the Doce River Canyon System (Figure 1 inset) (Brush et al., 2004; Maia, 79 \n\n2013; Schreiner et al., 2009). Connections between the modern Doce River and the several 80 \n\nincised valleys which constitute the Doce River Canyon System have been previously 81 \n\nsuggested in the scientific literature (Alves, 1999; A. M. C. Fran\u00e7a, 1979; M. C. Fran\u00e7a et 82 \n\nal., 2015; Maia, 2013), and at the mid-continental slope of the Abrolhos Bank and Doce 83 \n\nRiver shelf Mass\u00e9 et al. (1996) and Tintelnot (1995) registered high kaolinite contents, 84 \n\nconnected with the eastern and southeastern Brazilian rivers\u2019 mineralogical signature. 85 \n\nThe Doce River Basin (Figure 1) is an important medium sized drainage basin in 86 \n\n\n\neastern Brazilian coastal zone (de Oliveira et al., 2012; Marques et al., 2004) with area of 87 \n\n86.715 km2 (http://www.cbhdoce.org.br/; Souza and Knoppers, 2003) constituting the 88 \n\nsecond largest drainage basin in eastern Brazil. The Doce River originates in the 89 \n\nmountainous hinterland, over 1300m of altitude (i.e., Serra da Mantiqueira and Serra do 90 \n\nEspinha\u00e7o) and throughout its 850km course crosses the crystalline Precambrian basement, 91 \n\ncovered by a thick weathered mantle, and the Tertiary coastal iron-rich sediments of the 92 \n\nBarreiras-Formation (Carmo and Vasconcelos, 2004; Gunnell, 1998). 93 \n\nThe Doce River drainage basin is under a hot and humid tropical climate with 94 \n\nmarked rainy summer and dry fall-winter seasons (Cwb, Cwa and Aw K\u00f6ppen-Geiger 95 \n\nclimate types, Peel et al., 2007). This seasonality is due to the SASM and SACZ activity, 96 \n\nand average precipitation in the basin is 1400 mm/a with at least 80% falling during the 97 \n\nrainy season (October to March). Exceptionally, in areas close to the coast, rains are 98 \n\ndistributed throughout the year, with austral winter rainfall brought by extratropical 99 \n\ncyclones (Garreaud et al., 2009). The Doce River discharge follows the rainfall pattern and 100 \n\nis strongly seasonal varying from 500 m3/s, from May to October, to 1300 m3/s, from 101 \n\nNovember to April (source: www2.ana.gov.br, runoff measurements from the Colatina 102 \n\nWater Station, located 90 km from the river mouth). 103 \n\nThe outer shelf and the upper 600 m of the water column over the continental slope 104 \n\nare occupied by the Brazil Current (BC) (Figure 1). Starting around 10oS, the BC originates 105 \n\nfrom the South Equatorial Current as a relatively weak western boundary current (R. G. 106 \n\nPeterson and Stramma, 1991; Stramma and England, 1999) and transports Tropical Surface 107 \n\nWater (TSW) and South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) southwards (da Silveira et al., 108 \n\n2000; Stramma and England, 1999).  109 \n\n 110 \n\nhttp://www.cbhdoce.org.br/\n\n\n 111 \n\n  112 \n\nFigure 1: Location of the geological archives investigated in this study (i.e., GeoB3228-1 and \n\nLapa Sem Fim Cave, LSF) and of the Doce River basin in central eastern South America. \n\nLower inset details the location of GeoB3228-1 and the Doce River Canyon System (DRCS, \n\nseafloor geomorphology digital model extracted from Schreiner et al., 2009).

Figure prepared using topography and \n\nbathymetry data from GEBCO14 (www.gebco.net). Doce River basin contour provided by \n\nthe Brazilian Geological Service (CPRM, http://geobank.cprm.gov.br/).  \n\nhttp://www.gebco.net/\n\n\nThe interaction of the BC, the morphological barrier of the broad and shallow 113 \n\nAbrolhos Bank and the Vit\u00f3ria-Trindade Ridge characterize the surface hydrography in the 114 \n\nstudy area. (Summerhayes et al., 1976) showed that surface temperatures and productivity 115 \n\non the shelf edge are affected by upwelling of SACW during austral summer. Further on, 116 \n\ndata from surface drifters revealed the unexpected oceanographic complexity of the region, 117 \n\naffected by the temporal occurrence and migration of the Vit\u00f3ria Eddy (Schmid et al., 118 \n\n1995). Consequently, the Doce River Shelf presents special conditions, where local land 119 \n\ninput and upwelling of relatively nutrient-rich SACW at the shelf edge are significant 120 \n\nfactors influencing the local sedimentation and primary production (Ekau and Knoppers, 121 \n\n1996; Knoppers et al., 1999; Summerhayes et al., 1976).  122 \n\nBetween 600 and 1200m, the Intermediate Western Boundary Current transports 123 \n\nAntarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) and the underlying Upper Circumpolar Deep Water 124 \n\n(UCDW) equatorwards (da Silveira et al., 2004; Schmid et al., 1995).  125 \n\nLapa Sem Fim Cave (Figure 1) developed in low metamorphic grade limestones of 126 \n\nthe Bambu\u00ed Group (de Almeida et al., 1976), close to center of the modern NW-SE axis of 127 \n\nthe SACZ (Carvalho et al., 2004) (Figure 2), where precipitation occurs almost exclusively 128 \n\nduring the active phase of the SASM (e.g., (Vera et al., 2006). 129 \n\nThe modern climate outside of the cave is tropical semihumid (Aw, K\u00f6ppen-Geiger 130 \n\nclimate type, Peel et al., 2007) with mean annual precipitation around 950 mm 131 \n\n(http://www2.ana.gov.br) and rainfall concentrated in the austral summer (90% of total 132 \n\nrainfall amount is recorded from October to March). Once the monsoon season ends, 133 \n\nrainfall virtually ceases.  134 \n\nThe SASM starts in October, has its most active phase between December and 135 \n\nFebruary, and demise in April (e.g.,(Marengo et al., 2001; Raia and Cavalcanti, 2008). 136 \n\nSASM intensity is mainly influenced by insolation, which is modulated by precession and 137 \n\nexcentricity in orbital timescales, and ITCZ dynamics in millennial to seasonal timescales. 138 \n\nHigher (lower) insolation over the Southern Hemisphere (SH) strengthens (weakens) the 139 \n\nmonsoon system by increasing (decreasing) the land-sea thermal gradients, and ITCZ 140 \n\npositioning is linked to moisture availability to SASM. Nowadays the Atlantic section of 141 \n\nITCZ migrates seasonally reaching its northernmost location, 10\u00b0N, in August and 142 \n\nsouthernmost, 1\u00b0S, in March (mean latitudes at longitude 30\u00b0W, (Nobre and Shukla, 1996), 143 \n\n\n\nNevertheless, it has been suggested that during abrupt cooling events in the Northern 144 \n\nHemisphere it migrated further southward of the Equator, with increased moisture influx to 145 \n\nSASM related to southward shifts on ITCZ (Deplazes et al., 2013; L. C. Peterson et al., 146 \n\n2000; Str\u00edkis et al., 2015).  147 \n\nThe SASM pathway to central and southeastern SA follows the SACZ NW-SE axis 148 \n\n(Figure 2). The latter is defined as a transient convective system characterized by a 149 \n\nnebulosity band formed by transport of Amazon moisture via low level jets to central and 150 \n\nsoutheastern South America (SA) (Vera et al., 2006). SACZ is evident year round but more 151 \n\nintense during austral summer, when it is connected with the area of convection over the 152 \n\ncentral part of the continent, and produces episodes of intense rainfall over much of its 153 \n\nNW-SE axis (Figure 2) (Liebmann et al., 1999).  154 \n\nFigure 2: Monthly long term mean precipitation (Xie and Arkin, 1997) during the austral \n\nsummer (January, February and March; JFM).

Materials and methods 155 \n\n3.1 Materials 156 \n\nThe investigated marine gravity core GeoB3228-1 (19\u00b045\u201936\u201d S, 38\u00b045\u201936\u201d W, 157 \n\n1095 mbsl, 567 cm total length) was retrieved from the Brazilian continental slope during 158 \n\nRV Victor Hensen cruise JOPS II, leg 8 (P\u00e4tzold et al., 1996) (Figure 1). One-meter-long 159 \n\nsections of core GeoB3228-1 were longitudinally split and described, and then stored at 4oC 160 \n\nat the GeoB Core Repository, MARUM-Center for Marine Environmental Sciences, 161 \n\nUniversity of Bremen. Visual core inspection revealed that it is composed mostly of olive 162 \n\ngray mud with no (visual) evidence of disturbance within the discussed interval (158 cm to 163 \n\n308 cm, (P\u00e4tzold et al., 1996). Syringe samples (10 cm3) were collected from the working 164 \n\nhalves at specific depths for AMS 14C and EDP-XRF analyses. 165 \n\nThe stalagmites used in this study, namely LSF15, LSF16 and LSF03, were 166 \n\ncollected from Lapa Sem Fim Cave (16\u00b008\u201952\u2019\u2019S, 44\u00b036\u201938\u2019\u2019W), located in central-eastern 167 \n\nBrazil. The stalagmites were then cut along their growth axis and stored in the Laboratory 168 \n\nof Karstic Systems, Geoscience Institute, University of S\u00e3o Paulo. Visual inspection 169 \n\nrevealed that all three stalagmites are composed of clear and milky white calcite with 170 \n\nvisible growth layers. Carbonate sampling for isotopic analysis was done with a Sherline 171 \n\n5400 microsampler coupled with a digital ruler, allowing up to 0.4 mm resolution.  172 \n\n3.2 Age models 173 \n\nThe age model of marine sediment core GeoB3228-1 was established based on five 174 \n\nAMS 14C analyses spaced between 22 and 50 cm from each other (Table 1). The sample\u2019s 175 \n\npreparation was executed in the Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology Laboratory (P2L) 176 \n\nat the School of Arts, Sciences and Humanities of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, and 177 \n\nconsisted in drying the marine sediment (50?C maximum oven temperature), soaking in a 178 \n\nbeaker with water overnight, wet sieving over >125\u00b5m and >63\u00b5m combined meshes, 179 \n\nrinsing both fractions with Milli-Q water and final drying (50?C maximum oven 180 \n\ntemperature) of the residues. After these steps, both fractions (>125 \u00b5m and between 125 181 \n\n\u00b5m and 63 \u00b5m) were stored in glass vials and labeled. For each sample, 10 mg of tests of 182 \n\nplanktic foraminifera Globigerinoides ruber and Globigerinoides sacculifer were selected 183 \n\n\n\nfor AMS 14C dating from the >125 \u00b5m fraction under a binocular microscope. For the 184 \n\nsample located at 308 cm core depth tests of these species did not amount to 10 mg and the 185 \n\nrequired mass was completed with tests from other shallow-dwelling planktic foraminifera 186 \n\navailable. 187 \n\nRadiocarbon analyses were performed at the Beta Analytic Laboratory, Miami, 188 \n\nUSA or at Poznan Radiocarbon Laboratory, Poznan, Poland. Raw radiocarbon ages were 189 \n\ncalibrated for the reservoir effect (Bard, 1988; Franke et al., 2008) and for variations on the 190 \n\noriginal 14C concentration in the atmosphere (Reimer et al., 2013) using the online software 191 \n\nCalib 7.0.2 (Stuiver and Reimer, 1993) and the Marine13 calibration curve (Reimer et al., 192 \n\n2013). All ages are indicated in calibrated years before present (cal kyr BP, here shortened 193 \n\nas ka, where present is 2000 A.D.). The age model is based on linear interpolation between 194 \n\ncalibrated radiocarbon ages (i.e., interpolated from the 2? ranges) for the entire record. 195 \n\nFor the age model of the Lapa Sem Fim isotopic record, between 100 and 120 mg of 196 \n\nspeleothem carbonate (depending on U concentration) have been dated by U-Th method 197 \n\nusing inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry technique at the University of 198 \n\nMinnesota, USA, following the procedures described by (Shen et al., 2002). All of the total 199 \n\n26 datings yield errors&lt;1% (Table 1), and of these, 14 had already been published by 200 \n\n(Str\u00edkis et al., 2015). The age model was linearly interpolated between U-Th ages for the 201 \n\nentire record. 202 \n\n3.3 Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca in bulk sediments of GeoB3228-1 203 \n\nTi, Fe and Ca counts were determined at 5 mm intervals with 20 seconds of 204 \n\nirradiation time directly over the pristine archive halves of the core, using a X-ray 205 \n\nfluorescence (XRF) Core Scanner II (AVAATECH Serial No. 2, 10kV, and 0.35 mA) at the 206 \n\nMARUM \u2013 Center for Marine Environmental Sciences, University of Bremen, Germany. 207 \n\nPrior and after daily analysis, the instrument was calibrated against a set of pressed powder 208 \n\nstandards (Jansen et al., 1998). Acquired XRF spectra were processed with the WinAxil 209 \n\nand WinBatch software packages. The resulting data were expressed as element intensities 210 \n\nin counts per second. 211 \n\nSubsequently, 10 discrete samples taken every 17 cm, on average, were freeze-212 \n\ndried, powdered and homogenized with an agate mortar, and had Ti, Fe and Ca 213 \n\n\n\nconcentrations measured on an energy dispersive polarization X-ray fluorescence (EDP-214 \n\nXRF) spectrometer (Panalytical Epsilon 3X). We assessed the analytical quality of the 215 \n\nmeasurements by repeated analyzes of several different certified standard reference 216 \n\nmaterials (e.g. MAG-1; Govindaraju et al., 1994). The measured values were within 1% of 217 \n\naccepted values. The standard deviation of replicated sediment samples was less than 2%. 218 \n\nElements concentrations are expressed in grams per kilogram of dry sediment. 219 \n\nThe EDP-XRF absolute concentrations were used to calibrate the scanner XRF 220 \n\nintensities into calibrated proportions using the regression method described by (Weltje and 221 \n\nTjallingii, 2008). The calibrated curve was then also expressed in grams per kilogram of 222 \n\ndry sediment. 223 \n\n3.4 Oxygen isotopes from Lapa Sem Fim stalagmites 224 \n\nCalcite powder (~200 ?m) was analyzed with an on-line, automated carbonate 225 \n\npreparation system (Finnigan Gas Bench) linked to a Finnigan Delta Plus Advantage mass 226 \n\nspectrometer at the Laboratory of Stable Isotopes, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The 227 \n\nproduced oxygen isotope ratios were corrected using a linear regression curve constructed 228 \n\nusing analysis results of four different standards: IAEA-CO-8, NBS18, NBS19 and REI, 229 \n\nthe in house standard. REI and samples were analyzed sequentially on a 1 to 6 ratio. The 230 \n\nanalytic precision of oxygen isotopic ratios is ?0.1\u2030 and values are reported as ?18O 231 \n\nrelative to the Vienna Peedee Belemnite standard. For clarity, on the comparison with 232 \n\nTi/Ca ratios, we interpolated the original data for every 65 yrs (the lowest sampling 233 \n\nresolution throughout the three stalagmites) using the integrated interpolation function of 234 \n\nsoftware AnalySeries version 2.0.8 (Paillard et al., 2011). Since LSF16 and LSF15 are 235 \n\njoined at a sensitive period for our discussion, we show their overlapping signal between 15 236 \n\nand 14.5 ka. LSF16 and LSF03 were joined using their signals overlap as tie point, at 17.33 237 \n\nka.  238 \n\n\n\n4. Results 239 \n\n4.1 Age models 240 \n\nGravity core GeoB3228-1 age model (Figure 3a) show an apparently continuous 241 \n\nsedimentation from 12.30 ka downwards. The sedimentation rates are high, 35 and 20 242 \n\ncm/kyr, between the beginning of the record (23 ka) and 18.35 ka and lower (~8 cm/kyr), 243 \n\nbut stable, between 18.35 ka and the end of the record at 12.30 ka.  244 \n\nDepths and U-Th datings, an important contribution to this work is the robust 245 \n\nchronological control of our Lapa Sem Fim (LSF) speleothem record, from the stalagmites 246 \n\nLSF15, LSF16 and LSF03 were combined in a composite record (Figure 3b). The LSF03 247 \n\nage model section was established with 7 ages and covers the interval from 22.86 until 248 \n\n17.34 ka. The LSF16 age model section was produced with 10 ages spanning from 17.29 ka 249 \n\nuntil 14.53 ka. The LSF15 age model section is based on 8 ages straddling from 15.21 ka 250 \n\nuntil 12.13 ka. The LSF composite growth rate averaged 10.58 cm/kyr and varied from 1.54 251 \n\ncm/kyr between 20.46 ka and 19.35 ka within LSF03 to 77 cm/kyr between 14.75 ka and 252 \n\n14.53 ka within LSF16. At the same period, LSF15 presented an average of 7.7 cm/kyr. 253 \n\n 254 \n\nFigure 3: Age models of marine sediment core GeoB3228-1 (a) and Lapa Sem Fim Cave \n\ncomposite record (b) with respective sedimentation and growth rates, respectively.

Also on average the 260 \n\nproportion by weight between Fe : Ti : Ca on GeoB3228-1 was 0.63 : 0.07 : 1.  261 \n\nEDP-XRF calibrated ln(Ti/Ca) and ln(Fe/Ca) records show virtually identical 262 \n\ncurves for the whole record (23.00 to 12.30 ka) (Figure 3). Elemental ratios remain 263 \n\nrelatively high between the beginning of the record at 23.00 ka and 15.93 ka, forming a 264 \n\nplateau interrupted only by 3 excursions to lower values ranging from 400 to 800 yr in 265 \n\nduration (centered at 20.08, 18.37 and 16.38 ka). After 15.93 ka, ln(Fe/Ca) and ln(Ti/Ca) 266 \n\nbegin a steady decrease, briefly interrupted at 15.67 ka, until 15.23 ka after which they 267 \n\nshow a slight increase. At 14.92 ka, ln(Fe/Ca) and ln(Ti/Ca) sharply resume the decreasing 268 \n\ntrend until 13.69 ka, when they reach minimum values. From 13.69 ka onwards, elemental 269 \n\nratios increase towards plateau values until the end of the record. Since ln(Fe/Ca) and 270 \n\nln(Ti/Ca) present virtually identical records, we decide to use only ln(Ti/Ca) for the 271 \n\ndiscussion.   272 \n\n4.3 Oxygen isotopes from Lapa Sem Fim stalagmites 273 \n\nOur isotope record is composed of 840 ?18O values, yielding a temporal resolution 274 \n\nbetween 3 and 65 yrs (15 yrs on average). The ?18O signal averaged -6\u2030 through the whole 275 \n\nstudied period (23 to 12.30 ka) and oscillated with amplitude of 5.9\u2030. It is worthy of note 276 \n\nthat the ?18O data from LSF16 and part of LSF03 (up until 19.35 ka) was originally 277 \n\npublished by (Str\u00edkis et al., 2015).  278 \n\nThe LSF composite ??18O begins at 22.86 shows -6 \u2030 at the base of the record, 279 \n\ntrending toward less negative values until 21.35 ka, after that values stabilize around -5 \u2030 280 \n\nfor 1.1 kyr and sharply increase at 20.22 ka and remain around -4 \u2030 for ~400 years . At 281 \n\n19.83 ka ??18O values decrease to -6 \u2030 and oscillate around that value for 700 years. At 282 \n\n19.14 ka isotopic values increase 1 \u2030 on a less negative excursion that lasted 800 years 283 \n\nuntil 18.29 ka, when??18O values gradually resume decreasing. From 18.11 ka onwards the 284 \n\nrecord is composed by two consecutive double-plunged shapes. The oldest, between 18.11 285 \n\nto 14.7 ka, characterized by isotopic values oscillating from -8.6 \u2030 and -6 \u2030 is interrupted 286 \n\n\n\nby a lasting less negative excursion centered at 16.38 ka (when values reached ~ -6.5 \u2030) 287 \n\nand a briefer one centered at 17.19 ka (Str\u00edkis et al., 2015). The youngest double-plunged 288 \n\nstructure on the isotopic record ranged from 14.7 ka and 12.58 ka with values oscillating 289 \n\nfrom -6.8  \u2030 and -2.8 \u2030. The latter was interrupted by a more negative excursion around 290 \n\n14.00 ka. 291 \n\n 292 \n\nFigure 4: Lapa Sem Fim Cave ?18O composite record (a), and GeoB3228-1 Ti/Ca (b) and \n\nFe/Ca (c) records.

Discussion 293 \n\n5.1 Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca in bulk sediments of GeoB3228-1 294 \n\nFe and Ti within marine sediment cores can be used as tracers of the siliciclastic 295 \n\ncomponents of terrestrial sediments, and vary proportionally to the terrigenous fraction, 296 \n\nwhereas Ca is largely derived from biogenic CaCO3 shell material (i.e., mostly pteropods, 297 \n\nforaminifera, and calcareous nannoplankton) (Govin et al., 2012). Elemental ratios 298 \n\nincluding Ca (e.g., Fe/Ca) are sensitive to dilution effects (i.e., enhanced biological 299 \n\nproductivity, carbonate dissolution), which can affect reconstructions of terrestrial climate. 300 \n\nNevertheless, in our record, post depositional carbonate dissolution and/or overgrowth were 301 \n\nnot observed and could be ruled out, validating the use of Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca to discuss 302 \n\nmarine versus terrigenous input as described below.  303 \n\nWe assume that Ca fluxes remained relatively constant throughout the recorded 304 \n\nperiod. Only a few studies investigated changes in paleoproductivity in the oligothrophic 305 \n\nwestern South Atlantic Ocean (i.e., Mahiques et al., 2007; Nagai et al., 2010; Toledo, 2008; 306 \n\nToledo et al., 2007). Toledo (2008) developed their work in an area affected by the Cabo 307 \n\nFrio upwelling system (Mahiques et al., 2005) and the changes in productivity were mainly 308 \n\nattributed to increased/decreased upwelling, which do not necessarily correspond to oceanic 309 \n\nconditions in our study area. Mahiques et al. (2007) and Nagai et al. (2010) found increased 310 \n\nproductivity during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 23 to 19 ka, Mix et al., 2001)  and 311 \n\nrelatively stable paleoproductivity values during Termination 1. Even during the LGM our 312 \n\nFe/Ca and Ti/Ca log ratios remained stable, which led us to assume that possible 313 \n\nproductivity changes during our our studied time window did not affect our signal.  314 \n\nSea level rise, however, appears to have modulated our signal. Each of the 315 \n\nprogressively younger decreases in ln(Ti/Ca) has a higher amplitude in relationship to the 316 \n\nprevious one, consistent with progressive distancing of the river mouth from the study site 317 \n\ndue to sea level rise. Between 23 and 12 ka, sea level rose around 65m globally (e.g., 318 \n\nLambeck and Chappell, 2001), with the highest sea level change rates occurring during 319 \n\nMelt Water Pulse 1A (MWP1A, Deschamps et al., 2012). MWP1A began at ~14.65 ka and 320 \n\nwas synchronous to the onset of the BA. At ~14.7 ka, there is indeed a sharp decrease in 321 \n\nour Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca records (Figure 4).  322 \n\n\n\nPrevious works have used Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca ratios to trace changes in terrigenous 323 \n\ninput of fluvial origin of South American rivers, particularly offshore the semiarid 324 \n\nnortheastern Brazil, where repeated authors pointed out increases in the terrigenous input 325 \n\nduring Heinrich events due to southward shifts of the ITCZ (Arz et al., 1999; 1998; 326 \n\nJaeschke et al., 2007; Jennerjahn et al., 2004; Nace et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015).  327 \n\nIn comparison to these studies though, we observe a different trend in our data. The 328 \n\nnoticeable features of our records are the lower terrigenous excursions centered at 20.08, 329 \n\n18.37, 16.38, 15.23 and 13.65 ka representing decrease in terrigenous input to the basin, 330 \n\nwhich translate into dry periods in the catchment area and decreased Doce River runoff.  331 \n\nCuriously, Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca remained stable even during time windows when we would 332 \n\nexpect SASM related terrigenous input to increase (e.g., Str\u00edkis et al., 2015). This can be 333 \n\ntentatively explained by three hypotheses, explored on subsection 5.3. 334 \n\nThe most prominent features observed in our curves is by far the long standing 335 \n\ndecrease in Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca between 15.5 ka and 12.5 ka, which starts before the BA (at 336 \n\n14.7 ka) and ends with ratios increasing again almost to plateau values during the Younger 337 \n\nDryas (YD).  338 \n\n5.2 ?18O in stalagmites from Lapa Sem Fim Cave 339 \n\nSpeleothem ?18O in tropical and subtropical lowlands is usually interpreted as a 340 \n\nprecipitation proxy, indicating changes in precipitation source (Cruz et al., 2006; 2005) 341 \n\nand/or amount (Bony et al., 2008; Risi et al., 2008). The first imply that moisture becomes 342 \n\nprogressively impoverished in 18O as further away from its source it travels, and the second 343 \n\ndescribes the negative correlation between monthly rainfall amount and monthly weighted 344 \n\nmean ?18O. Given that in the LSF area 90% of the annual precipitation is related to SASM 345 \n\nactivity, negative (positive) anomalies in ?18O from LSF stalagmites have been interpreted 346 \n\nto reflect increases (decreases) in precipitation, that, in turn, are related with higher (lower) 347 \n\nintensity of the SASM (Str\u00edkis et al., 2015; 2011).  348 \n\nBased on this assumption, our ?18O signal shows neither too wet nor too dry 349 \n\nconditions between 23 and 18.1 ka. The most remarkable feature during this period being a 350 \n\ndrier excursion between 20.64 and 20.13 ka (which is also related with the smallest growth 351 \n\nrate in our record, the 1.54 cm/kyr between 20.43 and 19.35 ka).  352 \n\n\n\nBetween 14.7 ka and 13.15 ka, the LSF15 ?18O signal can be divided in three phases 353 \n\nrepresenting two drier excursions separated by a relatively wet one, correspondent to the 354 \n\nB\u00f8lling (14.7 - 14.13 ka), Older Dryas (14.13-13.86 ka) and Aller\u00f8d (13.86 \u2013 13.15 ka) 355 \n\nperiods, in chronological order (period names according to Mangerud et al., 1974). On 356 \n\nLSF15 between 13.15 and 12 ka, ?18O are more negative, pointing to SASM intensification 357 \n\nright before and during the YD. It is worthy of note that the LSF record presented here is 358 \n\nthe most detailed record describing precipitation changes within the B\u00f8lling\u2013Aller\u00f8d 359 \n\ninterstadial in South America. 360 \n\n5.3 Integrating elemental ratios and stable isotopes  361 \n\nLSF ?18O records 8 excursions toward less negative values that are synchronous to 362 \n\ndecreases on Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca from GeoB3228-1 (with the exception of one, at 17.20 ka) 363 \n\n(Figure 5). This confirms that excursions toward less negative values on our speleothem 364 \n\nrecord are connected with runoff decrease in the Doce River Basin, as shown by the 365 \n\ndecreases on Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca. Since over 80% of the rainfall on the Doce River basin and 366 \n\nLapa Sem Fim Cave is brought by SASM, we interpret that during these periods the 367 \n\nmonsoon intensity was weakened, likely connected with decrease in moisture influx caused 368 \n\nby relatively northward positioning of the ITCZ.  369 \n\nHowever, the inverse seems not to be valid, i.e., excursions toward more negative 370 \n\n?18O values on LSF are not related to increased Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca log ratios on GeoB3228-1. 371 \n\nThere are two possibly related hypotheses to explain this apparent mismatch, each 372 \n\ninvolving one of our proxies. 373 \n\nFirst, decreases in stable isotopes ratios in speleothems formed under ideal 374 \n\nconditions (i.e., calcite crystallization in isotopic equilibrium with drop water isotopic 375 \n\ncontent) are produced by the amount effect (i.e., 18O impoverishment on rainfall moisture 376 \n\nlinearly correlated with the amount of rainfall (Bony et al., 2008; Risi et al., 2008)) over the 377 \n\nkarstic system or along the moisture path since its departure from the reservoir, which is 378 \n\nprimarily the ocean. Hence, calcite isotopic composition is not necessarily only a recorder 379 \n\nof precipitation amount over the cave itself, as the moisture can have been depleted 380 \n\nprogressively and unequally along its pathway from the reservoir. In this scenario, 381 \n\nincreased precipitation over the Amazon due to southward ITCZ shifts would already 382 \n\n\n\ntransmit 18O-poor moisture to areas under SACZ influence without necessarily increasing 383 \n\nrainfall amount over the cave.  384 \n\n 385 \n\nSecond, different weathering patterns and sediment transport between densely 386 \n\nvegetated tropical eastern SA and the semiarid areas should also be considered. As 387 \n\nmentioned above, previous studies that assessed shifts in precipitation and the related 388 \n\nchanges in Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca were carried out off northeastern Brazil (Arz et al., 1998; 389 \n\nJaeschke et al., 2007; Jennerjahn et al., 2004; Nace et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015). That 390 \n\narea is characterized by semiarid climate (Bsh, K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate type, Peel et al., 391 \n\n2007) which favor a fast response of the terrigenous input to oceanic basins for several 392 \n\nreasons. As the countryside is usually hot and dry, the landscape is dominated by relatively 393 \n\nsparse savanna vegetation (Cole, 1960; Machado et al., 1997) and shallow rock-soil 394 \n\ninterface (B\u00e9tard et al., 2007). Under these conditions, abrupt floods or increased rainfall 395 \n\nFigure 5: Detailed comparison between GeoB3228-1 ln(Ti/Ca) and Lapa Sem Fim Cave ?18O. \n\nBlue circles represent U-Th ages and correspondent error bars. Black circles represent 14C \n\ndatings with correspondent 2? uncertainty. Grey dashed lines connect lower ln(Ti/Ca) values \n\nwith less negative ?18O excursions (red lines). \n\n\n\namount can easily transport weathered material to the ocean, increasing Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca 396 \n\nratios in case of wetter conditions. Inversely, the humid climate of the Doce River Basin 397 \n\nfavors the development of thick weathering profiles and well developed tropical vegetation. 398 \n\nIn this scenario, weathering profiles are better fixated and to some extent protected from 399 \n\nerosion thus, characterizing a vegetational buffer to terrigenous input to the ocean caused 400 \n\nby precipitation increase. The inverse, decrease of rainfall, naturally leads to decreased 401 \n\nriver runoff and terrigenous material transport, in accordance with both our records (Figure 402 \n\n5). 403 \n\nRelying on either one of these hypotheses does not affect our conclusions, that 404 \n\ncentral eastern SA experienced extremely drier than average conditions at specific periods 405 \n\nduring Termination I and LGM, most prominently during the BA. We suggest that these 406 \n\ndrier periods were related to weakened intensity of SASM. 407 \n\n5.4 The B\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d interstadial in South America 408 \n\nA northward shift of the ITCZ during the BA (see Deplazes et al., 2013) and 409 \n\nreferences therein) would have decreased the moisture influx to the SASM, decreasing also 410 \n\nits intensity and, consequently the amount of precipitation in our study area.  411 \n\nWe further compared our Ti/Ca and ?18O records with the output of the 412 \n\nSYNTRACE run of the CCSM3 fully-coupled climate model with transient forcing for the 413 \n\nlast deglaciation or Termination I (45\u00b0W to 37\u00b0W, 20\u00b0S to 13\u00b0S, Liu et al., 2009) (Figure 414 \n\n6a). In this simulation, the HS1 increase in precipitation over the region of the Rio Doce 415 \n\nBasin was relatively smaller than the abrupt decrease due to the onset of the BA. Also, in 416 \n\nagreement with our results, the BA was the driest period within 23 and 12 ka. The model, 417 \n\nhowever, does show the earlier transition to drier conditions in the end of HS1 and before 418 \n\nthe BA, as shown by Ti/Ca ratios in our marine sediment core. We assume this happens 419 \n\nbecause the model was elaborated mainly with Northern Hemispheric forcings (Liu et al., 420 \n\n2009) that exclude the regional variations which can have caused such earlier SASM 421 \n\nintensity decrease in the end of the HS1. 422 \n\nThe marine sediment cores GeoB3129-1 and GeoB3911-3 (Arz et al., 1999; 423 \n\nJennerjahn et al., 2004; Weldeab et al., 2006) (Figure 6e), were collected off northeastern 424 \n\nBrazil, where southward shifts of the ITCZ resulted in increased terrigenous input (Fe/Ca 425 \n\n\n\nratios). Fe/Ca composite from cores GeoB3129-1 and GeoB3911-3 show the same 426 \n\nprecipitation trend implied by LSF ?18O (Figure 6c) and similar to GeoB3228-1 Ti/Ca 427 \n\n(Figure 6d) and Fe/Ca ratios. The HS1 structure described by (Str\u00edkis et al., 2015) can also 428 \n\nbe recognized in the GeoB3129-1 / GeoB3911-3 Fe/Ca composite, showing a prominently 429 \n\nwet HS1c, followed by a dry excursion compatible with HS1b, a brief return to wetter 430 \n\nconditions in the beginning of the HS1a, followed by a transitional passage to drier 431 \n\nconditions that remain during the BA. On both GeoB3228-1 and GeoB3129-1 / GeoB3911-432 \n\n3 Fe/Ca composite the beginning of the B\u00f8lling period is indistinguishable from the end of 433 \n\nHS1a. The Fe/Ca increase (on GeoB3129-1/GeoB3911-3 composite) at 14 ka is relatable 434 \n\nwith the LSF ?18O decrease between B\u00f8lling and Aller\u00f8d periods, possibly explainable by a 435 \n\nbrief southward shift of the ITCZ during the Older Dryas cold period in the Northern 436 \n\nHemisphere. This southward shift would have briefly intensified SASM, reflecting as more 437 \n\nnegative ?18O values on our Lapa Sem Fim Cave composite and not being recorded in our 438 \n\nmarine sediment core due to the intrinsic characteristics of Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca ratios from 439 \n\nDoce River basin, already discussed in the previous subsection.   440 \n\nOn GeoB3228-1 Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca ratios, the 14.7 ka abrupt decrease in the 441 \n\nterrigenous input can be connected to either a rapid decrease in SASM intensity or the fast 442 \n\nsea level rise during MWP1A (Deschamps et al., 2012).  443 \n\nThe comparison between precipitation estimations from SYNTRACE run of the 444 \n\nCCSM3 (Liu et al., 2009), Fe/Ca from marine sediment cores GeoB3129-1 and GeoB3911-445 \n\n3 (Arz et al., 1999; Jennerjahn et al., 2004; Weldeab et al., 2006) and our coupled 446 \n\nGeoB3228-1 Ti/Ca and LSF ?18O allow us to confirm decreased SASM intensity in eastern 447 \n\nSA during the BA, likely related to northward positiong of ITCZ and consequent reduced 448 \n\nmoisture influx to SASM.  449 \n\n\n\n  450 \n\nFigure 6: (a) Annual mean precipitation over eastern Brazil (45\u00b0W to 37.5\u00b0W, 20\u00b0S to 13\u00b0S) \n\nfrom the SYNTRACE simulation (Liu et al., 2009), (b) GISP2 ?18O record on the GICC05 \n\ntime-scale (Rasmussen et al., 2014), (c) Lapa Sem Fim Cave ?18O (parcially published by \n\nStr\u00edkis et al., 2015), (d) GeoB3228-1 ln(Ti/Ca) (this study), and (e) GeoB3129-1 and \n\nGeoB3911-3 Fe/Ca composite (Arz et al., 1999).

Conclusion 451 \n\nThe 2 kyr long B\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d interstadial had a clear impact in South American 452 \n\nclimate, leading to long standing dry conditions in central eastern South America. The 453 \n\nmarkedly dry conditions during B\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d interstadial are related to weakened 454 \n\nintensity of the South American Summer Monsoon, likely caused by reduced moisture 455 \n\ninflux to the continent due to the contemporaneous northward shift of Intertropical 456 \n\nConvergence Zone.  457 \n\n 458 \n\nAcknowledgments 459 \n\nWe thank U.
