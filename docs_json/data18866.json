SIAL\n\nABSTRACT\n\nAn investigation of the tectonic controls of the fluvial morphology and sedimentary processes of an area located\n\nsouthwest of Manaus in the Amazon Basin was conducted using orbital remote sensing data. In this region, low topo-\n\ngraphicgradientsrepresentamajorobstacleformorphotectonicanalysisusingconventionalmethods. Theuseofremote\n\nsensing data can contribute significantly to overcome this limitation. In this instance, remote sensing data comprised\n\ndigital elevation model (DEM) acquired by the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) and Landsat Thematic\n\nMapper images. Advanced image processing techniques were employed for enhancing the topographic textures and\n\nproviding a three-dimensional visualization, hence allowing interpretation of the morphotectonic elements. This led\n\nto the recognition of main tectonic compartments and several morphostructural features and landforms related to the\n\nneotectonic evolutionof this portionof theAmazonBasin. Features suchas fault scarps, anomalousdrainagepatterns,\n\naligned ridges, spurs andvalleys, are expressed in theenhanced imagesas conspicuous lineaments alongNE-SW,NW-\n\nSE,E-WandN-Sdirections.

SILVA et al.\n\nartificial shadowing in different directions and color en-\n\nhancements allows interpreting the terrain features.\n\nIn the Amazon region, morphotectonic analysis is\n\nnot a simple task due mainly to the lack of altimetric\n\ndata at adequate scales. Most of this region has only\n\ncartographic maps in the scale of 1:250,000, without or\n\nonly with a few topographic data, mainly due to low to-\n\npographic gradients. This data constraint occurs mostly\n\nalong the Amazon River channel, where there are only\n\npointaltimetricvalues. Moredetailedcartographyislim-\n\nited to some charts in the scale of 1:100,000, restricted\n\nto the region surrounding the city of Manaus and some\n\nneighboring areas. Furthermore, existing topographi-\n\ncal surveys were carried out in the 1970s and 1980s,\n\nbased on small-scale aerial photographs, with altimetric\n\ndata being estimated on the basis of the height of tree\n\ncanopies, which sometimes does not express the actual\n\nground heights.\n\nA new remote sensing technology based on radar\n\ninterferometry (InSAR) is making it possible to acquire\n\nhigh quality altimetric data (Madsen and Zebker 1998).\n\nUsing this technology, NASA launched the Shuttle Ra-\ndar Topography Mission (SRTM) in 2000, which al-\nlowed the acquisition of altimetric data and the gen-\n\neration of DEMs of nearly 80% of the Earth\u2019s surface\n\n(Rabus et al. 2003). Thesedatawereused in thepresent\n\nstudy in order to overcome the scarcity of information\n\non the topographyof thestudy regionand toenablemor-\n\nphotectonic analysis.\n\nIn spite of the limitations inherent to the region\u2019s\n\nthick vegetation coverage, and the available SRTM data\n\nwith moderate spatial resolution (90 m), DEMs enabled\n\nthree-dimensionalvisualizationoftheregion\u2019slandscape\n\nand contributed significantly to the analysis of the main\n\ngeomorphologic features. The topographic data con-\n\ntained in these DEMs are more precise than those con-\n\ntained in theprevious topographicchartsof thearea, and\n\npermit the extraction of information for the elaboration\n\nof several types of thematic maps. Furthermore, the use\n\nof three-dimensional (3-D) digital visualization tools, in\n\nconjunction with the SRTM data, allows for the recog-\n\nnition of important and previously unknown morpho-\n\nstructural.\n\nA 3-D model has been generated for the region\n\nsouthwestofManausalong theSolim\u00f5esRiver, between\n\nthe towns of Iranduba and Manacapuru, encompassing\n\nabout 23,850 km2 (Fig. 1), for the purpose of morpho-\n\ntectonic analysis. The area comprises an important seg-\n\nment of the Amazon Basin affected by Cenozoic tec-\n\ntonics and has the availability of topographic maps at\n\n1:100,000scaletocompareresultsfromdifferentapplied\n\nmethods. Analyses of the drainage network, landscape\n\nfeatures and geological information were spatially in-\n\ntegrated to support the morphostructural interpretation,\n\nthe field checking of structural features and the spatial\n\nanalysisof theCenozoiccover. Important structural fea-\n\ntures, such as tectonically uplifted and lowered areas,\n\nfault scarps, aligned ridges and spurs, and anomalous\n\npatterns in thedrainage,weredetermined. Such features\n\nwere used to interpret the morphotectonic framework of\n\nthe study area and to compare it to the regional neotec-\n\ntonic model proposed by Hasui (1990) and Costa and\n\nHasui (1997).\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nThe materials used for the morphotectonic analysis in-\n\nclude: a) topographic maps of Manaus and Manaca-\n\npuru at 1:100,000 scale (Manacapuru SA.20-Z-D-II and\n\nManaus SA.20-Z-D-III); b) geological map of Brazil at\n\n1:2,500,000 in digital format, prepared by the Geolog-\n\nical Survey of Brazil \u2013 CPRM (Bizzi et al. 2001); c)\n\nLandsatEnhancedThematicMapper(ETM+)multispec-\n\ntral image (path 231/row 62, acquired on 07.10.2001);\n\nand d) digital elevation model from the Shuttle Radar\n\nTopographic Mission (NASA).\n\nDrainage elements and topographic contours of the\n\navailable topographic maps were manually drawn using\n\na digitizing table and vector-data capture software, for\n\nqualitative comparison with SRTM data. Data obtained\n\nfromthegeologicalmapofBrazilweresuperimposedon\n\ntheDEMwith theuseofgeographic information system\n\n(GIS) software for integrated analysis.\n\nThe Landsat ETM+ image was submitted to geo-\n\nmetrical correction based on known ground control\n\npoints (GCPs). The assessment of positional errors was\n\ncarried out through root mean square (RMS) analysis,\n\nwhichresultedinamaximumerrorof50meters,compat-\n\nible with the working scale. The geometrical correction\n\nof the image was performed with a warping technique.\n\nThe final image was converted into UTM projection,\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2007)79 (4)\n\n\n\nANALYSIS OF TECTONIC FLUVIAL IN THE AMAZON RIVER 695\n\nMANAUS\n\n6\n0\n0\n0\nW\n\no\n\nCities\n\nDrainage\n\nRoad\n\nArea of the study\n\n0 10 205\nkm\n\n61\u00b030'0\"W\n\n61\u00b030'0\"W\n\n61\u00b012'0\"W\n\n61\u00b012'0\"W\n\n60\u00b054'0\"W\n\n60\u00b054'0\"W\n\n60\u00b036'0\"W\n\n60\u00b036'0\"W\n\n60\u00b018'0\"W\n\n60\u00b018'0\"W\n\n60\u00b00'0\"W\n\n60\u00b00'0\"W\n\n59\u00b042'0\"W\n\n59\u00b042'0\"W\n\n59\u00b024'0\"W\n\n59\u00b024'0\"W\n\n4\u00b012'0\"S\n\n3\u00b054'0\"S\n\n3\u00b036'0\"S\n\n3\u00b018'0\"S\n\n3\u00b00'0\"S\n\n2\u00b042'0\"S\n\nB\nR\n-3\n19\n\nAM-070\n\nB\nR\n-1\n7\n4\n\nA\nM\n-0\n1\n0\n\nFig. 1 \u2013 Map of the location of the study area (southwest of the city of Manaus).\n\nzone 20. Lineament extraction and landscape/drainage\n\ninterpretation were made from the geometrically cor-\n\nrected image, using a RGB (red, green and blue) color\n\ncomposition of bands 3, 4 and 5, and also individual\n\nbands 5 and 7.\n\nSRTM data were obtained through NASA\u00b4s web-\n\nsite (http://www.jpl. nasa.gov/srtm/index.html). SRTM\n\nused twodifferent radar systems: CbandandXband. In\n\nthe present study the C band data were used.\n\nThe original spatial resolution of SRTM data is 1\n\narcsecond, equivalent to 30 m on the ground. However,\n\nfor strategic reasons (the mission was funded by the\n\nNational Imagery and Mapping Agency, North-Amer-\n\nican military cartographical agency), SRTM data made\n\navailable to the public for areas outside North Amer-\n\nica have a moderate spatial resolution of 3 arcseconds,\n\nequivalent to about 90 m. Even so, the quality of data is\n\nsufficient to generate 3-D models compatible to scales\n\naround 1:100,000, with horizontal and vertical accura-\n\ncies of about 50 m and 12 m, respectively. This repre-\n\nsentsasignificantadvanceforareaswith limitedaltimet-\n\nric data, such as the Amazon.\n\nThere are some limitations of InSAR technology\n\nfor topographic surveysof vegetation-covered areas that\n\nmust be taken into consideration. The main limitation\n\nis the ability of radar waves to penetrate into vegetation.\n\nFor C band, radar penetration is only partial when the\n\nvegetation is dense. It must, therefore, be expected that\n\nthe DEMs used in this work may not represent with fi-\n\ndelity the true ground surface topography of the study\n\narea, yet theymaycontain topographic valueswhich are\n\nintermediatebetween theplant canopy\u2019s topographyand\n\nthat of the ground.\n\nDEM processing included converting its carto-\n\ngraphicprojection, performingcontrast enhancementby\n\nhistogram adjustments and applying synthetic shading\n\nand 3-D visualization techniques. The altimetric con-\n\ntour lines were extracted from the DEM and compared\n\nwith the available topographic maps.

In this way, the topography, given\n\nby the DEM image, modulates the pixel color intensity\n\nof each of the Landsat ETM+ bands used in the RGB\n\ncolor composite, producing an image in which the in-\n\nformation from the DEM and the Landsat bands is fully\n\nmerged.\n\nThe geomorphologic analysis comprised the iden-\n\ntification and characterization of landscape elements in-\n\ndicative of modern tectonic deformations, such as linear\n\nfeatures, fault scarps, formation of asymmetric terraces,\n\nlow (modern deposition sites) and high (sites prone to\n\nerosion) blocks. Maps of lineaments and relief forms\n\nwere generated to provide support for the interpretation.\n\nTheprinciplesof the relief analysisused in this studyare\n\nbased on Cooke (1990), Summerfield (1993), Stewart\n\nandHancock(1994)andKellerandPinter (1996). Anal-\n\nysis of the drainage network was based on recognition\n\nof drainage patterns associated with structural elements\n\n(weaving, parallel, rectangular, in chandelier patterns,\n\namongothers), channelanomalies (anomalousmeander-\n\ning, rectilinear channels, etc.), formation of lakes and\n\nriverswithdrownedvalleysanddrainage lineaments, as-\n\nsociated to the Cenozoic tectonics. The drainage map\n\nwas used for the interpretation of these features and for\n\ntheextractionofdrainage lineaments. Drainageanalysis\n\nwas based on Howard (1967), Ouchi (1985), Schumm\n\n(1986), Deffontaines (1989), Summerfield (1993) and\n\nStewart and Hancock (1994), among others.\n\nThemapsobtained fromtheanalysisof lineaments,\n\nrelief forms and drainage network were integrated with\n\nSRTM DEM and Landsat ETM+ images used as a basis\n\nfor field checking of the main interpreted features. The\n\nfinal results were integrated as a morphotectonic map,\n\nshowing the tectonic compartments of the study region.\n\nDATA ANALYSIS AND PROCESSING\n\nIn order to evaluate the precision of SRTM topographic\n\ndata, a comparison was made with elevation contours\n\nobtained from the topographic maps Manaus SA.20-Z-\n\nD-III and Manacapuru SA.20-Z-D-II (Fig. 2). Most of\n\nthe topographic contours on the existing maps corre-\n\nspond to the 50 m level, being restricted to limited areas\n\nreaching up to 100 m in altitude (Fig. 2A). To the south\n\nof theSolim\u00f5esRiver, thereareonlya fewareasexhibit-\n\ning50mcontour lines, since the level of theAmazonian\n\nplain is generally lower than 30 m.\n\nIt is possible to generate topographic contour lines\n\nusing SRTM data at any intervals, bearing in mind that\n\nthesedatahaveatheoreticalerrorofabout12minheight.\n\nHowever, a large number of contour lines would hinder\n\nthe comparative analysis. Therefore, contour lines were\n\ngenerated at levels 35, 50and70m(Fig. 2B),which are\n\nrepresentative of the relief of the region and are within\n\nthe theoretical error of the data. The 100 m level was\n\nexcluded, since its occurrence is rare anddoesnot repre-\n\nsent any broad or significant surface. The generation of\n\nthe contour lines relative to these levels was performed\n\nthrough automatic extraction and tracing using digital\n\nimage processing software.\n\nThe comparison between map and SRTM eleva-\n\ntions was done qualitatively, and the results showed that\n\nthey were quite similar. Furthermore, the 30 m contour\n\nclosely follows point values with this height shown on\n\nthemaps. Therefore, theSRTMdatawere considered to\n\nbe satisfactory and appropriate for performing the mor-\n\nphostructural analysis in the study region.\n\nA synthetic directional shading filter was applied\n\nto the SRTM model represented in pseudo-color, for\n\nthe purpose of enhancing the topography and landscape\n\nfeatures(Fig.3A).Theazimuthandelevationvaluesused\n\nin this synthetic shadingmaybevaried interactively, en-\n\nabling the selection of optimal combinations of azimuth\n\nand elevation values to enhance the desired morpholog-\n\nical features. The best combination was found to be an\n\nazimuth of 62? and elevation of 53?, as shown in Fig-\nure 3B. This filtered image was used as the basis for the\n\ninterpretation of the relief compartments and, from this\n\ninterpretation, to infer the main brittle structures (frac-\n\ntures and faults) present.\n\nGEOLOGIC AND TECTONIC CONTEXT\n\nThe study area is located along the Solim\u00f5es-Amazon\n\nRiver system (Fig. 4), in the Amazon Palaeozoic Basin,\n\nwhere the following lithostratigraphic units crop out:\n\nAlter do Ch\u00e3o Formation (Cretaceous), I\u00e7\u00e1 Formation\n\noruppermemberof theSolim\u00f5esFormation (Neogene),\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2007)79 (4)\n\n\n\nANALYSIS OF TECTONIC FLUVIAL IN THE AMAZON RIVER 697\n\nFig. 2 \u2013 Comparison between topographical contour lines obtained from the 1:100.000 topographic charts (A) and those from the SRTM model\n\n(B).

This unit is uncon-\n\nformable with the Alter do Ch\u00e3o Formation and com-\n\nprises interlayeredsandyandmuddydeposits, formed in\n\nan alluvial system. The occurrence of the I\u00e7\u00e1 Forma-\n\ntion in this region is controverse (controversial?), with\n\nmany authors considering only the Solim\u00f5es Formation\n\n(Costa et al. 1978, Louren\u00e7o et al. 1978). Rossetti et\n\nal. (2005) consider that the I\u00e7\u00e1 Formation has a Plio-\n\nPleistocene age, based on the fact that this unit overlies\n\nunconformably the Solim\u00f5es Formation (Miocene).\n\nQuaternary sediments occur along the Amazon\n\nRiver and its tributaries and consist of fluvial sand and\n\nmud formed in meandering bars, floodplains, crevasse\n\nsplays, abandoned meanders and lakes setting (Nasci-\n\nmento et al. 1976, Costa et al. 1978, Latrubesse and\n\nFranzinelli 2002). In the southwest area of the city of\n\nManaus, Latrubesse and Franzinelli (2002) recognized\n\nan ancient alluvial plain dominated by point bars, a\n\nbarred floodplain and a floodplain dominated by chan-\n\nnels along of the Amazon River.

Close to the rivers, however, the relief changes to\n\nwell-dissected and small forms, defininga characteristic\n\ntopographic alignment (Fig. 3C). The Aria\u00fa River re-\n\ngion, between Iranduba and Manacapuru, includes a flat\n\nsurface with levels not higher than 50 m, often flooded\n\nand covered by Quaternary sediments.\n\nThe region to the south of the Solim\u00f5es River, in\n\nthe central area, corresponds to the Amazon Lowered\n\nPlateau, and comprises the towns of Careiro and Mana-\n\nquiri. Its relief is low (around 50 m), with flat and dis-\n\nsected tops and poorly-evolved drainage. In this region,\n\nthe Castanho River marks the boundary between two\n\nlowered surfaces. On its left margin, on the outskirts\n\nof Manaquiri, heightsare typicallybelow30m,whereas\n\nthe right margin exhibits altitudes between 30 m and\n\n50 m. This configuration of the relief shows a gentle\n\nunlevelling that may reach up to 20 m. Moreover, this\n\nsurface is in the same level of the Solim\u00f5es River plain,\n\ngettingmixedupwith terracesof theNegroRiver,Aria\u00fa\n\nRiver and of the right margin of the Manacapuru River.\n\nThisunlevellingbetweenthetwosurfacesbecomesmore\n\nconspicuous when visualized through a 3-D model of\n\nthe DEM with high vertical exaggeration (Fig. 3D).\n\nThe Solim\u00f5es River floodplain comprises an area\n\nwhere the Quaternary sediments are distributed accord-\n\ning to the migrations of the river\u2019s channel. The heights\n\nof thecountless typesofalluvialdeposits (meanderbars,\n\nnatural levee, etc.), usually submerged under the rivers\u2019\n\nhigh waters, do not exceed 25 m. The relief of this re-\n\ngion shows a group of tectonic landforms: fault scarps,\n\nasymmetricvalleysandterraces,depressionsandanoma-\n\nlous drainage patterns (such as rectangular types, mean-\n\ndering forms, and drowned rivers). These features form\n\nanasymmetric relief arrangement,which includes struc-\n\ntural highs and lows, found on several of the relief com-\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2007)79 (4)\n\n\n\n702 CLAUZIONOR L.

This fault controls the margins of\n\nthat river for more than 70 km and it is easily recog-\n\nnized on maps and satellite images as sets of rectilinear\n\nscarps on both margins of the river. Its extension may\n\nbe noted in the western region of the Aria\u00fa River, in the\n\ncontact between the Quaternary sediments and the Alter\n\ndo Ch\u00e3o Formation. It is possible that this fault extends\n\ntowards the Careiro region, forming the various NW-SE\n\nlineaments seen in this region (Silva 2005). According\n\nto Cordani et al. (1984), the Negro River Fault is a pos-\n\nsible extension of structures of the Amazonian Craton,\n\nsuggesting that they were reactivated during the Palaeo-\n\nzoic and Cenozoic times (Fig. 6A e B).\n\nIn the Aria\u00fa River region, some landforms suggest\n\ntheoccurrenceofblockmovements, suchasparallel and\n\nrectangular patterns in the course of the Acajituba River\n\n(rightmarginoftheRioNegroRiver),alignedconfluence\n\nof tributaries andalso theasymmetryof thedrainagebe-\n\ntweentheblocks(longandshort segments). Anexample\n\nof drainage asymmetry is the anomalous trellis pattern\n\nof the Acajituba stream, enclose to the scarp of the Ne-\n\ngro River (Fig. 6B). The parallel disposition of the wa-\n\ntershed between the Acajituba and Miriti streams and\n\nthe asymmetric valleys of the Miriti and Manacapuru\n\nrivers, along the NW-SE direction, are associated to in-\n\nterfluvial zones on the relief.\n\nOther NW-SE lineaments are observed in the Iran-\n\nduba and Cacau-Pir\u00eara region (Fig. 6B). These relief\n\nlineaments represent steep scarpswith altitudesof about\n\n50m, similar to those locatedon thewestern limit of the\n\ncity of Manaus, and are responsible for the rectangular\n\ngeometry of the Iranduba area (Iranduba Block). The\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2007)79 (4)\n\n\n\nANALYSIS OF TECTONIC FLUVIAL IN THE AMAZON RIVER 703\n\nIranduba Block is bounded by Cacau-Pir\u00eara and Iran-\n\nduba lineaments, forming the island where Iranduba is\n\nlocated. In the central portion of the block, the relief\n\nshows residual dissected hills with sub-horizontal tops\n\nthat stand out in the landscape and may be visualized in\n\nthe DEM (Fig. 3C and D).\n\nBetween the scarps of the Negro and Iranduba\n\nrivers there is a depressed region with altitudes up to\n\n50m,with terraces formedonQuaternarysediments, to-\n\ngether with Quaternary sediments from the Aria\u00fa River\n\nplain, both confined among Cretaceous deposits of the\n\nAlterdoCh\u00e3oFormation. In that sector, theAria\u00faRiver,\n\nthat links the Negro and Solim\u00f5es rivers, lies asymmet-\n\nrically on the plain due to the migration of the channel\n\ntowards east. The asymmetry of the channels is also ev-\n\nident in the Acajituba River. Close to the scarp of the\n\nNegro River it presents a trellis pattern, as well as ano-\n\nmalous confluence of its tributaries. The depressed area\n\nis controlled by the Negro River\u2019s Fault. Farther west,\n\nin the region of Manacapuru, the homonymous river\n\nlies oriented NW-SE and presents asymmetric channels\n\nand drowned mouth (the Manacapuru lake). The mor-\n\nphostructural arrangement shows unlevelled areas, with\n\nstrong relief asymmetry, characterized by tectonic land-\n\nforms and drainage anomalies associated to the Negro\n\nRiver Fault.\n\nCastanho River is the main tributary of the Soli-\n\nm\u00f5es River in the southern portion, showing a rectan-\n\ngular pattern associated with ENE-WSW and NW-SE\n\nlineaments and drowned-type drainage anomalies (Figs.\n\n3C, D and 6B). The extensive areas of still waters rep-\n\nresenting drowned rivers are called \u201clakes\u201d, such as the\n\nCastanho Lake. In this area, the formation of drowned\n\nchannels is associated with relief lineaments, which in\n\nturnare responsible for thedevelopmentof the rectangu-\n\nlar patternof the channels. The strongasymmetryof the\n\ntributary channels indicates that the surface is slightly\n\nlowered, dipping gently northward. Tributaries of the\n\nCastanho River also exhibit an arrangement parallel to\n\nthe lineaments ENE-WSW. The rectangular drainage\n\npattern observed in the Castanho River region is con-\n\ntrolled by NW-SE lineaments (Fig. 6A).\n\nAlong its fluvial plain, the Solim\u00f5es River shows\n\nstraight segments with former bar and meander situated\n\nin asymmetric positions (Fig. 6B). To the southwest of\n\nManacapuru, the river suddenly changes its course from\n\nE-W to NNE-SSW, for nearly 50 km. That region em-\n\nbraces a wide low area, with a flat relief which does not\n\nsurpass27m,dominatedbya seriesof lakes, suchas the\n\nCabaliana, Padre, Sacambu and Manacapuru, as well as\n\npresent and ancient bar deposits of the Solim\u00f5es River.\n\nTheboundariesofthealluvialplainsedimentsaremarked\n\nby NE-SW and E-W relief lineaments.\n\nThis extensive lowered region narrows down near\n\nManacapuru, where the river suddenly changes the di-\n\nrection of its course. P.E.L. Bezerra et al. (unpub-\n\nlished data) mentioned the existence of a series of tec-\n\ntonicdepressionswhichcontrol theQuaternarysedimen-\n\ntation along the channel of the Solim\u00f5es River. Silva\n\n(2005) described several strike-slip and normal faults\n\nand transtensive tectonic basins along the left bank of\n\nthe Solim\u00f5es River between Coari and Manaus.Among\n\nthesebasins, theManacapurupull-apartbasinstandsout,\n\nwith its peculiar rhombohedric form.\n\nIn the stretch between Manacapuru and Manaus,\n\nthe Solim\u00f5es River follows an approximate E-W course\n\nfor about70km(Fig. 6B). In that stretch the river shows\n\nevidences of erosion in both, the meander bars and the\n\ndeposits from the Alter do Ch\u00e3o and I\u00e7\u00e1 formations.\n\nThus, an area with a wide and another with a narrow\n\nfloodplain becomes evident along the river. The paleo-\n\ngeographicreconstructionshowsthat theSolim\u00f5esRiver\n\npresentedanE-Worientationon thisentire sector, possi-\n\nblywithmeanderingcharacteristics. Through theanaly-\n\nsis of SRTM and Landsat images, a lineament map was\n\nproduced (Fig. 6A), showing the relationship between\n\nthemorphostructural anomalies andmain structural fea-\n\ntures (Fig. 7).\n\nIn Figure 7 a conspicuous set of lineaments can be\n\nobserved in the older units (Alter do Ch\u00e3o and I\u00e7\u00e1 for-\n\nmations), showinganevendistribution in fourdirections\n\n(NE-SW, NW-SE, E-W and N-S). The analysis of these\n\nlineaments reveals that they represent sheaves or frac-\n\nture zones. The E-W fractures are the most frequent\n\nones and have also longer accumulated length, in spite\n\nof presenting no significant landscape elements. Frac-\n\ntures along N50E and N30-60W are frequent, whereas\n\nthose in the N-S direction are less so.

In the\n\nregion located south of the Solim\u00f5es River there is a\n\nsubsiding area associated with normal faults. Previous\n\nwork by Igreja and Franzinelli (2002) and Silva (2005)\n\nreferred to these NE-SW lineaments respectively as\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2007)79 (4)\n\n\n\nANALYSIS OF TECTONIC FLUVIAL IN THE AMAZON RIVER 707\n\ntransference,normalanddextralstrike-slipfaults. Those\n\nauthorsshowedthat these lineamentsareassociatedwith\n\na strike-slip system.\n\nThe E-W and N-S lineaments are more difficult to\n\ncharacterize because their morphostructural expression\n\ndoes not indicate the associated kinematics. The most\n\nsignificantE-Wfeature is theParicatuba lineament, rep-\n\nresenting the northern boundary of the Aria\u00fa River. In\n\naddition, other E-W lineaments may be seen cutting the\n\ntopography in the region of Manacapuru and Iranduba\n\nand in the south of the Careiro region (Fig. 8). The N-S\n\nstructures are less expressive, represented by scarce sets\n\nof lineaments on the region west of Manaus, in Man-\n\nacapuru and east and west of Careiro. Based on the re-\n\ngional tectonic model proposed by Hasui (1990), E-W\n\nfaults have been interpreted as dextral strike-slip faults,\n\nwhereas those along the N-S direction as normal faults\n\ndipping to the west (Igreja and Franzinelli 2002).\n\nAs a result of the morphotectonics analysis pre-\n\nsented here, three tectonic compartments were recog-\n\nnized in the study area (Figs. 8 and 9). The first com-\n\npartment comprises the northern portion of the area, en-\n\ncompassing thecitiesofManaus, IrandubaandManaca-\n\npuru, and includes the asymmetric graben of the Aria\u00fa\n\nRiver (Fig. 9A and B). The western limit of this graben\n\nis represented by the scarp of the Negro River Fault\n\nscarp, coinciding with the contact between Cretaceous\n\nand Quaternary units.\n\nThe second morphotectonic compartment is loc-\n\natedon the rightmarginof theSolim\u00f5esRiverandcorre-\n\nspondstotheareawithflatreliefandrectangulardrainage\n\npatterns. This compartment is marked by relief linea-\n\nments andaligneddrainage channels following theNW-\n\nSE and NE-SW directions. The lineaments along these\n\ntwo directions induce a parallel arrangement of the\n\ndrainage and relief, such as the fault scarp of Castanho\n\nRiver and portions of the watersheds of its tributaries.\n\nTheyalsocontrol stretchesof that riverandproducecon-\n\nspicuousdrainageanomalies. Thedevelopmentofa typ-\n\nical rectangular pattern and the remarkable relief asym-\n\nmetry,markedbyescarpments, pointout to theexistence\n\nof two blocks unlevelled by about 30 m, similar to the\n\nAria\u00fadepression. Themorphostructural featuresassoci-\n\nated with this compartment also include anomalous par-\n\nalleldrainagepatterns,drownedportionsofCastanhoand\n\nMamori lakes, anomalousbendsandchannelasymmetry\n\n(Fig. 9A). The relief elements and drainage anomalies\n\nshow a significant structural control of the present allu-\n\nvial sedimentation. The extensive abandoned deposits\n\non the left bank of the Solim\u00f5es River result from the\n\nmigration of the channel from NW to S-SE leading to\n\nthe present asymmetric position.\n\nThe third compartment is located west of Mana-\n\ncapuru and is represented by the alluvial plain of the\n\nSolim\u00f5es River. That area comprises part of the Purus\n\nRhombohedral Basin localized in western of this region\n\n(Silva 2005).\n\nThe paleogeographic reconstruction shows that the\n\nIranduba region, bounded by the Cacau-Pir\u00eara and Iran-\n\nduba lineaments, was once part of the left margin of the\n\nNegroRiver (Fig. 10A).Theancient channelof the river\n\nwas probably narrower and flowed along the Aria\u00fa de-\n\npression and, from there, into the Solim\u00f5es River (Fig.\n\n10B). The proto-channel of the Negro River opened by\n\nnormal faulting that formed the Negro River Graben.\n\nThisprocessmadepossible thedevelopmentofsedimen-\n\ntationat theconfluenceof theNegroandSolim\u00f5esrivers,\n\nwhere the Aria\u00fa River is situated today. The continu-\n\nous movement of the E-W binary produced the NW-SE\n\nfaulting observed west of Manaus and at Cacau-Pir\u00eara\n\nand Iranduba, resulting in the formation of fault scarps\n\n(Fig. 10C). Normal faulting generated an opening into\n\nwhich the Negro River was captured, thus changing its\n\nflow direction from south to east and south-east, aban-\n\ndoning the channel where the Aria\u00fa river currently lies\n\n(Fig. 10D). This E-W lineament played an important\n\nrole in the capture process observed in this area. The\n\npresence of ancient bar deposits indicates that the Soli-\n\nm\u00f5es River had meanders and was probably orientated\n\ntowards E-W, as currently seen between Manacapuru\n\nand Manaus (Fig. 10E). The migration of the Solim\u00f5es\n\nRiver towards southeast would be the result of tectonic\n\nprocesses, associated with the formation and evolution\n\nof the Manacapuru Rhombohedral Basin (Fig. 10).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe main tectonic compartments of the western Ama-\n\nzon Basin near Manaus were interpreted by means of\n\nmorphotectonic analysis, supported by orbital InSAR\n\n(SRTM) and optical (Landsat ETM+) images and field\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2007)79 (4)\n\n\n\n708 CLAUZIONOR L.

The tectonic compartmentswerenamed\n\nAria\u00fa Graben, Castanho-Mamori Graben and Manaca-\n\npuru Basin.\n\nThe Aria\u00fa Graben corresponds to an asymmetric\n\ndepression, where unlevelled Quaternary deposits are\n\nbounded by the NW-SE Negro River Fault. Morpho-\n\nstructural features recognized in association with the\n\nAria\u00fa Graben, include terraces, fault scarps, drainage\n\nasymmetry and anomalies, such as rectangular and trel-\n\nlis patterns, beheaded stream and drowned rivers.\n\nThe Castanho-Mamori Graben is a NE-SW rect-\n\nangular asymmetric feature located at the right margin\n\nof the Solim\u00f5es River. Its main tectonic boundary is\n\nthe Castanho Fault, also orientated towards NE-SW and\n\nplunging NW, controlling the course of the Castanho\n\nRiver. Morphostructural features recognized in associ-\n\nation with this graben include relief anomalies, such as\n\nfault scarps of the Castanho River, rectangular drainage\n\npatternsanddrownedriverswhichformedMamori,Cas-\n\ntanhoandJanauac\u00e1 lakes. These features are interpreted\n\nmostly as the result of faulting along NW-SE, NE-SW\n\nand N-S, represented by the relief and drainage linea-\n\nments along the same directions.\n\nThe Manacapuru Basin corresponds to the depres-\n\nsionwhere lakeCabaliana-Padrewasformedanddepicts\n\na rhombohedralgeometry. It is bounded to thenorthand\n\nsouth by E-W strike-slip faults and to the east and west\n\nby NE-SW normal faults, plunging NW and SE. In this\n\narea, the sudden change of the course of the Solim\u00f5es\n\nRiver is caused by faults, marking the boundary of the\n\nManacapuru Basin.\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2007)79 (4)\n\n\n\n710 CLAUZIONOR L. SILVA et al.\n\nThe results presented in this paper strengthen the\n\nimportant role of neotectonics in controlling the fluvial\n\nmorphologyand sedimentationprocesses of thewestern\n\nAmazon Basin. The configuration of relief patterns and\n\ndrainagenetworks, aswell as the spatial distributionand\n\ncharacteristics ofQuaternary sediments in the region lo-\n\ncatedsouthwestofManaus, areunmistakablyassociated\n\nwith the Cenozoic tectonic compartments here defined.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors would like to thanks the Dr. Giorgio Basi-\n\nlici of the Universidade Estadual de Campinas, who re-\n\nviewed parts of the manuscript.

Nessa\n\nregi\u00e3o, o baixo gradiente topogr\u00e1fico representa o principal\n\nobst\u00e1culo para a an\u00e1lise morfotect\u00f4nica usando m\u00e9todos con-\n\nvencionais. O uso de dados de sensores remotos pode con-\n\ntribuir significativamente para superar essa limita\u00e7\u00e3o. Desse\n\nmodo,dadosdesensoriamento remoto, compreendendomode-\n\nlo digital de eleva\u00e7\u00e3o (DEM) obtido pelo Shuttle Radar Topo-\n\ngraphic Mission (SRTM) e imagens Landsat TM, foram uti-\n\nlizados para essa investiga\u00e7\u00e3o.
