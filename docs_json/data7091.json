Reservoirs \nare man-made lakes with the primary purpose \n\nof storing water for power generation, flood \ncontrol and water supply among others. Reservoir \nconstruction markedly modifies the original \naquatic ecosystem interfering with all life forms. \nDams obstruct the water flow causing permanent \n\n\n\n818 PETRERE JR., M., WALTER, T. and MINTE-VERA, C. V.\n\nBraz. J. Biol., 66(3): 817-828, 2006\n\nflooding upriver and increasing water residence \ntime. Sediment transport processes are replaced by \nsediment deposition. The new ecosystem has been \nconsidered intermediate between a river and a lake \n(Margalef, 1983; Tundisi, 1986). \n\nEnvironmental changes resulting from a dam \nlead to considerable modifications in the structure \nof aquatic communities, originally adapted to the \nlotic habitat. The reservoir community results from \nthe restructuring of the original river community \nmainly by local extinction and abundance \nalterations of most populations (Ara\u00fajo-Lima et \nal., 1995). The species that persist are those able to \nreproduce and feed in the new ecosystem (Fernando \n&amp; Holcik, 1991) or in adjacent ecosystems such \nas an upstream floodplain (Agostinho, 1994). In \nBrazil, native and alien species from other river \nbasins and from other continents constitute the fish \nfauna of large reservoirs (Agostinho, 1994; 1996; \n1997; Agostinho et al., 2000; Welcomme, 1988). \n\nIn many Brazilian areas, small-scale fisheries \nare the only source of protein for the poor (McGrath \net al., 1993; Cerdeira et al., 2000), including urban \nareas with water bodies large enough to maintain \nharvestable fish populations, such as the reservoirs \nof Represa Billings in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, Lago \nPampulha, in Belo Horizonte and Lago Parano\u00e1, in \nBras\u00edlia (Petrere, 1995). \n\nThe small-scale fisheries of Represa Billings \n(Paran\u00e1 river basin) were described by Minte-\nVera &amp; Petrere (2000) based on a year round \nstudy (February/1996 to January/1997). The \nmain species, which was caught, was the alien \nNile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus (81.4% of the \ntotal landings in weight, 147,593.5 kg), followed \nby lambari Astyanax eugenmanniorum (13%), \ncommon carp Cyprinus carpio (2.4%), traira \nHoplias aff. malabaricus (2.1%) and the saguir\u00fa \nCyphocarax modestus (1.1%). Other species \nalso landed such as bagre (catfish) Rhamdia sp, \ncascudo (armoured catfish) Hypostomus sp, acar\u00e1 \nGeophagus brasiliensis, Congo tilapia Tilapia \nrendalli. Its fish fauna belongs to the Upper Paran\u00e1 \nProvince (Bonetto, 1986), comparatively well \nstudied in its middle and final stretches (Bonetto, \n1986; Barrela &amp; Petrere, 1994; Barrella &amp; Petrere, \n2003; Beaumord &amp; Petrere, 1994; Agostinho &amp; \nJulio, 1996; Britsk et al., 1999). Minte-Vera (1997) \nestimated the fish production of Represa Billings \nat 63 kg ha-1 year-1. This value is quite high when \n\ncompared to other reservoirs of the Paran\u00e1 basin, \nlike Itaip\u00fa (11.6 kg ha-1 year-1; Petrere, 1996), and \nlow when compared to the Brazilian Northeastern \ndams (from 18 to 667 kg ha-1 year-1; Petrere, 1995). \n\nIn Lago Parano\u00e1, the cast net and gill net small-\nscale fisheries have been prohibited since 1966. The \nonly legal fishery was the recreational hook-and-\nline fishery. The prohibition had no biological basis \nsince the catches were almost exclusively of alien \nspecies such as tilapias and carps, and was most \nlikely related to a security concern in the capital \ncity during the military government. Albeit being \nan illegal activity, there were at least 100 families \nliving exclusively from the Lago Parano\u00e1\u2019s fisheries \nin the Federal District in 1985, where the city of \nBras\u00edlia is. According to the most experienced \nfishers, the annual production was around 200 t \nof fish in 1985 (48.08 kg ha-1 year-1). The landings \nwere totally consumed in the satellite towns around \nBras\u00edlia and the supply was below the demand. \nFishers sold the fish to bar owners and middlemen \nor directly to consumers in street markets (Dornelles \n&amp; Dias Neto, 1985; Walter, 2000). \n\nThrough snowball type interviews, Walter \n(2000) estimated that there were 55 active fishers \nin 1999 in Lago Parano\u00e1 all coming from the \npoorest neighborhood around the Federal District \nof Bras\u00edlia. The annual catch was estimated at \n39 kg ha-1 yr-1, consisting mainly of Nile tilapia \nOreochromis niloticus (84.9% of the 62.5 t total \ncatch), followed by the common carp Cyprinus \ncarpio (11.1%) and 4.1% of other species. Its fish \nfauna also belongs to the Upper Paran\u00e1 Province \n(Ribeiro, 1994), although it has been less studied. \nThe monthly income from the activity was on \naverage U$ 238.7, but very variable among fishers \n(s = U$ 171.8, n = 22). In addition, each fisher \nhired three other people indirectly. Only 39.6% of \nthe fishers were exclusively in fishery activities, \na small percentage when compared to the fishers \nof the Represa Billings, but large when taking \ninto consideration that the fishery was illegal, \nunregulated and unreported at that time.\n\nThe Represa Billings and Lago Parano\u00e1 are \nboth located in large metropolitan cities, subject to \npollution, conflicts concerning water use, disordered \noccupation of its basin, etc. Nevertheless the small-\nscale fisheries in these reservoirs supply the needs \nof the poor and are important sources of income \nand cheap protein. In both reservoirs, the main \n\n\n\n819SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES INCOME IN TWO BRAZILIAN URBAN RESERVOIRS\n\nBraz. J. Biol., 66(3): 817-828, 2006\n\ncaptured species is the Nile tilapia. In the Represa \nBillings the fish is sold filleted to middlemen while \nin Lago Parano\u00e1, it is sold raw and is mainly for \nthe consumers. In addition, in Lago Parano\u00e1 the \ntravel distances are shorter than in Represa Billings \nallowing for the use of non-motorized canoes. \nThese aspects of fishing are likely to have an impact \non the fisher\u2019s profit from both reservoirs. In this \npaper, we carried out a comparative analysis to \nhighlight the factors that are important in defining \nthe income in both reservoirs.\n\nFinancial data are not typically collected in a \nsystematic way in small-scale fisheries. Although \nthese fisheries are complex bio-socio-economic \nsystems, most of the attention is always given to \nbiological data, mainly due to the training of fishery \nbiologists (Hilborn, 1985). Here we have calculated \nthe costs, incomes and profits from two small-scale \nfisheries and use these data in a financial analysis \nin order to compare the two reservoirs.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nStudy areas \n\nRepresa Billings \nRepresa Billings is located in the \n\nmetropolitan region of S\u00e3o Paulo (23\u00b0 42\u2019 and 23\u00b0 \n45\u2019\u2019 S, 46\u00b0 27\u2019 and 46\u00b0 22\u2019\u2019 W), in the headstreams \nof the Tiet\u00ea River, the main left bank tributary of \nthe Paran\u00e1 River in S\u00e3o Paulo state. It has an area \nof 127 km2 and a total volume of 1228.7 x 106 m3. \nIt is divided into two compartments separated by \na barrier (Pedreira with 112 km2 and Rio Grande \nwith 15 km2). The mean depth is 10 m and the \nperimeter is about 900 km (Rocha, 1984). The \naverage water residence time (AWRT) ranges \nbetween 50 to 100 days (CETESB, 1996). The \nreservoir was constructed with the purpose of \nstoring water for hydropower generation for the \ncity of S\u00e3o Paulo. The construction began in \n1925 but only in 1950 was the reservoir prepared \nto reach its maximum quota (Macedo, 1992). A \ncomplex system of pumps, levees and dams let \nthe water flow from the Tiet\u00ea and Pinheiros rivers, \nwhich cross the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, to be reversed \nto the upstream Billings reservoir and further up \nto the Rio das Pedras reservoir. From there, the \nwaters fall 740 m to the Henri Borden generator \n(880 MW, Abreu, 1990) into the city of Cubat\u00e3o \n\nat sea level, in the foothills of Serra do Mar \n(Rocha, 1984). \n\nRepresa Billings has a long history of species \nwhich started in 1948 with the introduction of the \ncommon carp Cyprinus carpio (Rocha, 1984). In \n1953, the Congo tilapia (or black tilapia as it is \nlocally known) T. rendalli was introduced there (and \nfor the first time in Brazil, Rocha et al., 1985). This \nspecies quickly proliferated, becoming dominant. \nAccording to the local fishers, the Congo tilapia \nstarted to decline in 1984, when the Nile tilapia \nOreochromis niloticus started to appear in the \nlandings. There were also attempts of introducing \nnative migratory species, without success (Minte-\nVera, 1997). The present ichthyofauna is dominated \nby the alien Nile tilapia and followed by some \nnative species, (Costa, 1998; Costa et al., 1998) \nseveral of which are a target for the fishers (Minte-\nVera &amp; Petrere, 2000).\n\nThe professional fisheries in the Billings \nreservoir mainly consist of cast nets and gill nets \nin motor canoes made of wood or aluminum with \nengines from 2 to 30 HP, crewed by one or two \nfishers. The gill net may be used actively in a fishery \nlocally known as batida (beating) where the fishers \nbeat the water surface with a bamboo stick to guide \nthe Nile tilapias towards the net (Minte-Vera &amp; \nPetrere, 2000). The tilapias are also caught with \ncast nets. The lambari (Astyanax eigenmaniorum, \nA. bimaculatus), carp (Cyprinus carpio), tra\u00edra \n(Hoplias aff. malabaricus) and sag\u00fciru (Cyphocarax \nmodestus) are caught with passive gill nets. Gill \nnets are set mainly overnight. Most of the fishers \nmaintain an informal commitment of exclusivity \nwith the middlemen (Minte-Vera et al., 1997). Nile \ntilapia catches are higher in areas close to Pedreira \nPumping Station (Minte-Vera, 1997). Besides \nprofessional fishing, a sport called ravine fishing is \nalso practiced by thousands of recreational fishers.\n\nLago Parano\u00e1 \nLago Parano\u00e1 is located in the urban district \n\nof Bras\u00edlia (15\u00b0 48\u2019 S and 47\u00b0 50\u2019 W), the capital \ncity of Brazil. The reservoir was filled in 1959, \nwhen Bras\u00edlia was being built. At that time, the \nconstruction of the reservoir was finished having \nthe aims of increasing the relative air humidity, \ngenerating hydroelectric power, making a recreation \narea and a fish nursery, improving the landscape \nand disposing of sewage and rainwater (Fran\u00e7a et \n\n\n\n820 PETRERE JR., M., WALTER, T. and MINTE-VERA, C. V.\n\nBraz. J. Biol., 66(3): 817-828, 2006\n\nal., 1964). Its hydrographic system belongs to the \nParan\u00e1 river basin and it receives the waters from \nRiver Parano\u00e1, 5 main perennial tributaries and 21 \nsmall streams feed it. The reservoir area is 38 km2, \nwith a volume of 498 x 106 m3, a mean depth of \n13 m, a maximum depth of 40 m, and an AWRT \nof 299 days (Starling, 1998). Lago Parano\u00e1\u2019s \nhydrographic basin has 1,046 km2 and in 1986 \nits main uses were as a preservation area (41%), \nindefinite occupation (19%), urban occupation \n(18%), agriculture and livestock (8%), small farms \n(7%) and water surface (4%, Silva et al., 1998). \nIn spite of having a large preserved area, it joins \na population of 500,000 inhabitants in its margins \nand sub-basins (mainly Riacho Fundo, Gama and \nTorto), who substantially contribute to pollution \n(Silva et al., 1998).\n\nIn 1979, the Company of Water and Sewage \nof Bras\u00edlia CAESB observed that phosphorous was \nthe main limiting nutrient to the eutrophication \nprocess of the lake that was accelerated by \nreceiving non-treated or inadequately treated \nsewage. Aiming to improve the water quality of the \nreservoir, two sewage treatment plants were built: \nETE SUL that started operating in 1993 and ETE \nNORTE in 1994. After three years, Lago Parano\u00e1 \nshowed signs of recovery (Starling, 1998). The \nhealth hazards posed by the consumption of the \nfish were evaluated in a multi-agency study in 1997 \n(ISDF/CAESB/UnB/IBGE, 1997). Heavy metal, \norganochlorine compounds and fecal coliform \nanalyses were carried out in all fish species from the \nLago Parano\u00e1 in several places, including the ones \nclose to sewage discharges and the concentrations \nwere all below the detection level. \n\nSince the construction of the reservoir, several \nfish species were introduced in order to stock the \nreservoir and enhance the small-scale and recrea-\ntional fisheries. Fish surveys done since 1959 have \nfound viable populations of native and alien species \nwith the dominance of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis \nniloticus), common carp, Congo tilapia (Tilapia \nrendalli), lambari (Astianax sp), acar\u00e1 (Geophagus \nbrasiliensis), sag\u00fcir\u00fa (Steindachnerina insculpta), \ntra\u00edra (Hoplias aff. Malabaricus), tucunar\u00e9 (Cichla \nsp), (Dornelles &amp; Dias-Neto, 1985; Grando, \n1989; Starling, 1989; 1998; Lazzaro et al., 1998; \nLebourges-Dhaussy et al., 1998). \n\nThe professional fisheries in Lago Parano\u00e1 \nmainly consist of cast nets and gill nets in rowing \n\ncanoes, crewed by individuals or pairs of fishers. \nFishers sometimes make their own equipment \nin order to reduce costs. The fishers come from \ndifferent satellite-towns around Bras\u00edlia. Some \nof these are outside the DF state, located in the \nstate of Goi\u00e1s. The landing places are scattered \nalong the reservoir shores, however it is possible \nto determine four main areas of concentration of \nfishers: Vila da Telebras\u00edlia (an area which has \nillegally been invaded since 1956), Vila Parano\u00e1 \n(satellite-town close to the dam); around ETE SUL, \nused by fishers coming from the satellite town of \nCeil\u00e2ndia) and around ETE NORTE. In 1999 there \nwere 70 registered legal professional fishers. There \nis also a large number of sport fishers, mainly using \nhooks and lines. \n\nData collection\nData were collected using closed question-\n\nnaires, containing personal information (name, \nsex, age, education, non-fisheries income, number \nof residents in the dwelling, number of dependents, \nfishing experience in years), costs related to the \nfishing activity and to commercialization. The \nquestionnaires were based on current methodology \nin social sciences successfully applied by IBAMA/\nDNOCS/GTZ (1992) in small-scale fisheries in \nNE Brazilian \u201ca\u00e7udes\u201d, where a fisher is initially \ninterviewed and he/she is asked to introduce the \nscientist to another fisher, who takes her/him to \nanother and so on, until all the available fishers are \ninterviewed. This procedure is known as snowball. \nTwo surveys were conducted in each reservoir, one \nin the rainy season and another in the dry season. \nIn Represa Billings, the surveys took place on \nOctober 15 to 16, 1999 and July 15, 2000 and in \nLago Parano\u00e1, on October 10 to 29, 1999 and on \nJuly 26 to 30, 2000. \n\nIn addition to the interviews, a data collection \nsystem was implemented in order to obtain daily \nlanding information. The system was in place \nfrom 15 October, 1999 to 15 January, 2000 and \nfrom 15 July, 2000 to 15 November, 2000 in \nboth reservoirs. In Lago Parano\u00e1, 17 fishers were \nincluded in the daily landing data collection and 12 \nin Represa Billings. The fishers were asked about \nthe catch by species, equipment and craft used, \nand effort in hours. The information was used to \nestimate the fisher\u2019s income to detect the main \nspecies, the equipment type and quantity, as well \n\n\n\n821SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES INCOME IN TWO BRAZILIAN URBAN RESERVOIRS\n\nBraz. J. Biol., 66(3): 817-828, 2006\n\nas the amount of fuel used for the boats (in Billings \nreservoir). Moreover, the prices of the equipment \nand boats were obtained from sellers and fishers.\n\nData analysis \nAfter the surveys, data were stored in a \n\ndatabase to calculate descriptive statistics. The \nformulae used for the computation of fisher\u2019s \nincome, costs and profits, closely follows Ceregato \nand Petrere (2003). \n\nWe tested the hypothesis of equality of the \nmean profit per fisher for the two reservoirs using \na two-tail t-test (Zar, 1996). The power of the test \nwas also computed (Zar, 1996). We used a multiple \nregression analysis (Chatterjee &amp; Price, 1991) \nto identify and quantify the social factors that \ninfluence the profitability of the fisheries. \n\nFirstly, a list of some continuous or discrete \n(dummy) Xji variables that may be important in \ngenerating the profit for the ith fisher (i = 1,2,\u2026,f) \nwere included in a multiple regression linear \nmodel:\n\nThe profit (Y\ni\n) can be expressed as a linear \n\ncombination of the social factors of the fishers: \n\nY\ni\n = b\n\n0\n + b\n\n1\nX\n\n1i\n + b\n\n2\nX\n\n2i\n + b\n\n3\nX\n\n3i\n + ...+ bnXni + e\n\ni\n\nwhere:\nY\n\ni\n - profit of the ith fisher; \n\nb\n0\n, \u2026, b\n\nn-\n parameters to be estimated using sum of \n\nsquares;\ne\n\ni\n - random variable assumed N ~ (0, ?2).\n\nRESULTS\n\nSituation of the fisheries\nThe small-scale fishery in Represa Billings is \n\nin a process of disarray. In 1997, there were 100 \nactive fishers (Minte-Vera et al., 1997). In October, \n1999, 52 fishers were interviewed, and only nine \nclaimed they were still fishing in the reservoir. \nThe others abandoned the activity or moved to \nBarra Bonita reservoir downstream (? 300 km). \nDuring the week, they fish in Barra Bonita and at \nweekends, return to the Represa Billings to stay \nwith their families. The situation was so serious \nthat the middlemen also moved down to Barra \nBonita and the restaurants around Represa Billings \nsold fish which came from Barra Bonita. In the \nCol\u00f4nia community (where there were six active \n\nfishers) the middleman reduced his visits from five \nto three times a week. The disarray was caused by \nan increase in the violence in the metropolitan area \nof S\u00e3o Paulo, mainly in the poor outskirts. The \nformer largest fishing spot of Pedeira (Minte-Vera, \n1997) is close to the Graja\u00fa slum, a very violent \narea. We were told about the occurrence of armed \nrobbery of fishers in canoes in order to steal the \nengines, resulting in the murder of one fisher. The \nnine active fishers moved to less productive fishing \nspots in areas close to their residences, affecting \ntheir profits negatively. \n\nIn the second survey in July 2000, the situation \nhad become even worse. From the nine original \nfishers, only three were still active. The middlemen \nstopped buying fish and one of the fishers sold the \nfish straight to the consumers. The fish was being \nsold cheaper than in the previous survey (R$ 2.80 \na kilo of tilapia filet, instead of R$ 3.00). However, \none of the three fishers started to sell it close to his \nresidence for R$ 4.00 the kilo. \n\nIn Lago Parano\u00e1, there were only 6 active \nfishers in November 1999. This situation was \nmainly due to the activity still being illegal and the \nprohibition being efficiently enforced by the police \n(Walter, 2000). In February 2000, the professional \nfishery with cast nets was legalized. In spite of this, \nin July, 2000 there were only 11 active fishers, \nmainly because of the occurrence of a very cold \nwinter (Walter, 2000). Some of the interviewed \nfishers continued to fish illegally with gill nets: \nfour fished exclusively with gill nets, four fished \nexclusively with cast nets and three with both types \nof equipment. \n\nSocioeconomic aspects of the fishers \nAmong 29 fishers interviewed, just 3 were \n\nfemale, all in Represa Billings. The age varied \nbetween 22 and 68 years, with an average of \n42.5 years (n = 29, s = 12.7), and 27.6% are \nilliterate. From the interviewees, 62.1% were \nmarried. However, Minte-Vera et al. (1997) and \nWalter (2000) point out that in both reservoirs it is \ncommon that the fishers do not differentiate between \nmarriage and cohabitation. In several situations, \nthere could be more residents in the dwelling than \njust the fishers and their dependents, since some \nmay not have enough financial autonomy to live in \nseparate houses. \n\n\n\n822 PETRERE JR., M., WALTER, T. and MINTE-VERA, C. V.\n\nBraz. J. Biol., 66(3): 817-828, 2006\n\nFishing\nThe small-scale fisheries in both reservoirs \n\nare mainly based on Nile tilapia. However, in the \nRepresa Billings the fishers also capture lambaris \nand sag\u00fcirus. In both reservoirs, fishers use active \n(batida) and passive gill nets and cast nets. Fishers \nwork alone or in pairs in small canoes. When in \npairs, fishers share expenses or hire an assistant \npaying a fixed salary or 30% of the catch. Some \nfishers have their children, husbands or wives as \ncrew, concentrating the income inside the family. \nHowever, the main family participation is in the \nfish processing and commercialization, with 31% \nof the relatives helping in both processes.\n\nOn average, the fishers of Represa Billings \nfish for 4.5 days a week (s = 1.5) and those at \nLago Parano\u00e1\u2019s fish for 5.4 days a week (s = 0.8). \nExtrapolating this information for a year, the \nreservoirs are not statistically different (Represa \nBillings: mean = 234.6, n = 12, s = 75.4; Lago \nParano\u00e1: mean = 279.1, n = 17, s = 41.0, t = 1.89, \nP > 0.05). The experience of the fishers in years \ncan be one of the factors that explain differences \nin the profit. The average years of experience of \nLago Parano\u00e1\u2019s fishers is 28 (n = 17, s = 14.2 years) \nand significantly higher than that of the Represa \nBillings which is 17.8 years (n = 12, s = 8.6, t = 2.21, \n0.01 &lt;P &lt;0.05). Aiming to assess whether fishing \nis sufficient in order to maintain the fisher and the \nfamily, two other factors are important: whether the \nfamilies have another source of income and if there \nis a period with no harvests (entressafra). Among \nthe 29 interviewees, 13 families have another \nsource of income besides fishing. On average, \nthese fishers have an \u201cextra\u201d income of R$ 410.9 \n(s = R$ 352.5), ranging between R$ 136.00 and \n\nR$ 1500.00. Minte-Vera (1997) and Walter (2000) \ndid not observe an entressafra in either reservoir. \n\nCosts \nThe costs of fishing mainly result from \n\nexpenses with canoes and the engine, fishing \nequipment and its maintenance and fuel. In the \nRepresa Billings, the boats are built of wood or \naluminum, with an average length of 5.4 m, which \nare more expensive but last more (Table 1). In \nLago Parano\u00e1, the boats are exclusively made of \nplywood, with an average length of 3.8 m which \nare less expensive and durable (Table 1). In Represa \nBillings, the canoes of all but one fisher are powered \nby an engine and in Lago Parano\u00e1 none of the \ncanoes have engines. The main cost of the engine is \nits acquisition and fuel, which in general is bought \nfrom the middlemen. During the data collection \nperiod, the average monthly exchange rate was \n1 U$ = R$ 1.9695 in October/1999, R$ 1.9299 in \nNovember/1999, R$ 1.8428 in December/1999, \nR$ 1.8037 in January/2000, R$ 1.7978 in \nJuly/2000, R$ 1.8092 in August/2000, R$ 1.8392 \nin September/2000, R$ 1.8796 in October/2000 \nand R$ 1.9480 in November/2000 (average for the \nperiod 1 U$ = R$ 1.87).\n\nFuel consumption was estimated to be \non average 2.16 liters for a trip (s = 0.9, n = 12; \nR$ 1.50 liter-1). The average cost of an engine \nwas about R$ 2066.7 (s = R$ 1025, n = 12). Its \nprice varied according to its power and the degree \nof depreciation when acquired (it is common for \nfishers to buy second hand engines). An engine \nlasts on average 12.2 years (s = 7.3, n = 12). \n\nThe two reservoirs present differences in the \nacquisition and maintenance of the equipment.

J. Biol., 66(3): 817-828, 2006\n\nboth reservoirs, there are three different strategies \nto obtain fishing equipment: i) the equipment is \nbought at the local market; ii) the raw materials \nare bought at the local market, but the equipment \nis handmade by the fisher himself and; iii) the raw \nmaterial is bought by the fisher who pays somebody \nelse to make the equipment. A similar situation is \nobserved for equipment maintenance: i) it is done \nby the fisher himself/herself; ii) the fisher hires \nsomebody to do it; iii) no maintenance at all is \ncarried out. According to the strategy adopted, the \ncosts will vary from one fisher to another.\n\nAs we already mentioned, fishers in both \nRepresa Billings and Lago Parano\u00e1 reservoirs use \ngill nets and cast nets. However, in Represa Billings \nit is common for the fishers to have a larger amount \nof extra equipment, unlike Lago Parano\u00e1, where \nfishers have exactly what they use on a daily basis. \nIn the first case, we considered the average length \nof the gill nets used daily to calculate the expenses. \nThe cast net is sometimes used in Represa Billings. \nHowever, it is the only equipment allowed by \nthe legislation in Lago Parano\u00e1. Its cost is highly \nvariable due to the fact that some fishers make it \nand others buy it (Table 2). \n\nOther costs may result from commercialization \nor from expenses related to transport. Taking this \ninto consideration, there are differences between \nthe two reservoirs. In Represa Billings, the main \nproduct is the filleted tilapia and acar\u00e1, followed \nby raw lambari and saguir\u00fa, sold raw. The fillets \n\nare wrapped in Styrofoam trays and sold to the \nmiddlemen (who usually supply the trays). To \nproduce a kilo of fillet, four kilos of raw fish are \nnecessary (Minte-Vera, 1997). In Lago Parano\u00e1, \nthe fish is eviscerated and sold to the consumers \nby kilo or in fish strings of 1 or 2 kg, and to the \nmiddlemen, in cans or by kilo. A can contains, on \naverage, 13.80 kg of fish (Walter, 2000). The fish \nsold to consumers incurs other expenses on ice (on \na lesser scale), the rent of a tent in the market and \ntransportation. A third expense in Lago Parano\u00e1 is \nrelated to transport from their homes to the reservoir, \nsince the fishers live far from the reservoir. Out of \nthe 17 interviewees, 12 fishers reported expenses \non bus tickets. Three reported expenses on fuel for \ntheir cars. On average, they spent R$ 6.2 day-1 on \ntransport (n = 15, s = R$ 5.1), varying from R$ 3.00 \nto R$ 25.00. Five fishers rented a tent in the street \nmarket, with a weekly cost of on average R$ 1.4 \n(n = 5, s = R$ 1.3). \n\nIncome \nThe income is the result of the total catch \n\nexcluding the consumption and donations \nmultiplied by the price of the fish. In the studied \nperiod, the total catch was 40,240 kg (Table 3) and \nthe total comsumption/donation was 199 kg.week-1. \nIn represa Billings, the main commercial species \nwere alien tilapias (51.2%) and the natives acar\u00e1 \n(33.3%), lambari (10.5%) and saguir\u00fa (2.7%). \nOther species correspond to 2.3%.

The high profit in Lago Parano\u00e1 is \nclear, since the intervals do not overlap (t = 44,90**, \ndf =27, with a retrospective power (Thomas, 1997) \nhigher than 0.99 for ? = 0.01). Furthermore, in \nRepresa Billings one fisher was interviewed, \nwho we later discovered (after having calculated \nit) had a loss not a profit! Minte-Vera &amp; Petrere \n(2000) point out that in Represa Billings, there are \ntwo types of fishers: the first group that catches \ntilapias exclusively, with beat gill net fishing \nand the second one that also fishes for lambaris, \nsag\u00fcirus and tra\u00edra with gill nets, catching tilapias \n\nin a smaller proportion. According to the authors, \nthe first group catches more, however only one \nfisher from this group was interviewed during the \nsurveys, showing an extreme profit when compared \nto the others. Finally, we calculated the monthly \nprofit of the fishers multiplying the daily profit by \nthe number of days of the month that they were \nactive for both seasons (Table 5).\n\nFactors that influence the fishers\u00b4 profit \nTo analyse the profits, a multiple linear ex-\n\nploratory regression model was initially consid-\nered with the following variables: dummies \u2013 sex, \nmarital status, fishing period (dry or rainy), fishing \nequipment, kind of partnership (partner/assistant), \nreservoir (Billings or Parano\u00e1); continuous varia-\nbles - number of dependents, years of experience, \nother sources of income, formal education and \ndays of fishing. The variables: fishing equipment \nand kind of partnership are not orthogonal. \nTherefore, three out of four possibilities were \nconsidered: fishing alone (yes = 1, no = 0), \n\n\n\n825SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES INCOME IN TWO BRAZILIAN URBAN RESERVOIRS\n\nBraz. J. Biol., 66(3): 817-828, 2006\n\nfishing with relatives (yes = 1, no = 0), fishing \nin partnership (yes = 1, no = 0), fishing with an \nassistant (yes = 1, no = 0). The variable: fishing \nequipment was also separated into three levels: \ncast net, gill net and beat fishing, only two were \nincluded in the model simultaneously. \n\nThe variable: formal education was trans-\nformed into ranks (Zar, 1996), where: Illiterate = 1, \n&lt;4 years of study = 2, 4 years = 3, > 4 and &lt;8 \nyears = 3, 8 years = 4, > 8 and &lt;12 years = 4. \n\nThe full model is:\nProfit = constant + sex + marital status + \n\nfishing period + fishing equipment + kind of \npartnership + reservoir + number of dependents + \nyears of experience + other sources of income + \nformal education + days of fishing. \n\nThe residuals of this model presented \nheterogeneity of variance. Therefore, asquare rooth \ntransformation in the response variate (Profit) was \napplied. \n\nThe adjusted final (minimum) model was: \n\u2022 (Profit)0,5 = 0.06 + 3.56* reservoir + 0.01* \n\ndays of fishing; and\n\u2022 where reservoir: Parano\u00e1 = 1; Billings = 0; \n\nn = 28, R2 = 0.642; F\n2,25\n\n = 22.4**.\nSo, the new residual analysis did not detect \n\nany violations of the usual assumptions of a linear \nmodel.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nAs explained, the fishers in both reservoirs are \nnot organized, and fishing is unregulated.

V.\n\nBraz. J. Biol., 66(3): 817-828, 2006\n\nthis, the activity supplies fishers\u00b4 needs of income and \nprotein. In both reservoirs, fishing is practised by the \npoor population, as previously shown by Minte-Vera \net al. (1997) and Walter (2000). In Lago Parano\u00e1, \nthe catch is exclusively of Nile tilapia, in contrast \nto Represa Billings\u2019s, where fishers use strategies \nto catch other species, mainly the lambari and the \nsaguir\u00fa apart from the main species, Nile tilapia. \n\nThe profit of Lago Parano\u00e1\u2019s professional \nfishers is far higher than the profit from the \nRepresa Billings fishers. This difference can be \nexplained by several factors: i) the use of cheaper \ncanoes, with no engine and thus no fuel expenses \nby the Parano\u00e1\u2019s fishers; ii) less fishing effort \ndue to shorter fishing trips and lower investment; \niii) direct commercialization to the final buyer in \nLago Parano\u00e1, where the raw and eviscerated fish \nfrom Lago Parano\u00e1 have similar prices to Represa \nBillings, which are the most appreciated filleted \nfish.\n\nHowever, Lago Parano\u00e1 is smaller (38 km2) \nthan Represa Billings (127 km2), with countless \naccesses, which facilitates small displacements and \nuse of rowing canoes. Another factor that explains \nthe presence of cheaper canoes with no engines \nin Lago Parano\u00e1 was the illegality of fishing from \n1966 to 1999, with a great risk of the craft (and \nfishing equipment) being confiscated by the police. \nWhen fishing was legalized in December, 1999 this \ntended to change, so much so that nowadays there \nare already fishers acquiring engines. The increase \nin fishing can mean more income, but its higher cost \ncan reduce their profit. Furthermore, in Represa \nBillings there is a need to use more equipment on \neach fishing trip, increasing the cost of equipment \nmaintenance and replacement.\n\nA second consideration is the commerciali-\nzation strategy of the fishers. In Represa Billings, \nthe fish is filleted, which makes it easier to be \nsold. There is also a strong link to the middlemen, \nnecessary due to the isolation where the fishers \nof the Col\u00f4nia community live that hinders them \nselling it directly and which in turn could increase \nthe income, if the fishers could sell it at the landing \nplace. This is unlikely since the landing places are \nisolated and far from potential markets.\n\nThe profit in both reservoirs, in spite of the \ndisarray of both fisheries, is high when compared \nto other fisheries. Ceregato &amp; Petrere (2003) when \ncomparing the profit of small-scale fisheries in \n\nthe Urubupung\u00e1 complex of reservoirs in the river \nParan\u00e1 downstream, found average daily profits of \nR$ 13.2 (U$ 11.3 as 1 U$ = R$ 1.1628 in July/98) \n(s = 25.4) for the reservoirs of Ilha Solteira (SP) \nand Jupi\u00e1 (SP), of R$ 4.1 (U$ 3.5) (s = 21.3) \nfor the Paran\u00e1 river and of R$ 1.5 (U$ 1.3) (s = \n35.1) for downstream Porto Primavera dam, in \nthe dry period. In the rainy period, the daily profit \nwas: R$ 19.5 (U$ 10.2 as 1 U$ = R$ 1.9231 in \nFebruary/99) (s = 37.4) for the reservoirs of Jupi\u00e1 \nand Ilha Solteira, R$ 12.9 (U$ 6.7) (s = 46.0) for \nthe Paran\u00e1 River between these reservoirs and \nPorto Primavera and R$ 23.0 (U$ 11.97) (s = 29.2) \nbelow the dam. Cetra &amp; Petrere (2001)) calculated \nthe daily income of fishers from the Tocantins \nRiver at US $2.00. Okada et al. (1997) calculated \nthe daily income of the fishers of two reservoirs \nin the Igua\u00e7\u00fa River at US $12.00. The monthly \nprofit of fishing in the Itaip\u00fa reservoir is US $25.00 \n(Agostinho et al., 1994). \n\nIn the present study, the profitability of the \nfishery is mainly explained by its context, i.e. by \nthe reservoir where it is carried out and by the \nnumber of days of fishing. Ceregato &amp; Petrere \n(2003), when studying Rio Paran\u00e1\u2019s professional \nfishers, observed that the profit could be explained \nalso by other variables such as formal education \nand type of fishing equipment.\n\nFisheries are complex bio-socio-economic \nsystems, but they are mainly studied only in \nbiological aspects. Financial data are important to \nunderstand fishers\u00b4 behavior as well as motivations \nand thus to assess how management policies affect \nthem.\n\nEconomic fishery information has been \nseldom collected, even in highly industrialized \nlarge-scale fisheries due to the lack of tradition and \npoor training in the subject by fishery biologists. This \ninformation is usually not taken into consideration \nfor management purposes or in order to give bank \ncredit to a fisher when he/she applies for it trying \nto improve his/her technology. It can be observed \nin this paper that this aim is not difficult to attain, \nas most of the necessary information has been \nobtained just by interviewing the fishers about their \ndaily activities and the financial analysis carried \nout is arithmetic. Therefore this study together with \nAgostinho et al. (1994) and Ceregato &amp; Petrere \n(2003) is another example of applying financial \nanalysis on two small-scale fisheries where a lot \n\n\n\n827SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES INCOME IN TWO BRAZILIAN URBAN RESERVOIRS\n\nBraz.

In view \nof the results here, it is not difficult to assess the \nadoption of different stock management strategies \nin order to increase fishers\u00b4 income and hopefully \nprotect the fish stock.\n\nAcknowledgments \u2014 We are grateful to the fishers from Lago \nParano\u00e1 and Represa Billing for their willingness to participate \nin this study.
