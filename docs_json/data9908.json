The seasonal effect on basic limnological features (thermal regime, oxygen distribution, phyto-\nplankton biomass, etc.) was also examined. The influence of the seasonality on the fluctuation of the zooplankton \ncomposition and abundance was not clearly detected (low degree of recurrent patterns). Rotifers (32 taxa) were the \nmost abundant organisms during almost the entire study period with some seasonal alternations in the maximum \nabundance peaks of the main taxa (Conochilus unicornis, Keratella americana, K. cochlearis and Hexarthra spp.), \nexcept for Polyarthra (mainly P. vulgaris). Only occasionally copepods were numerically dominant. Higher copepod \nabundance was positively associated to periods of increase in the water retention time. Among the Copepoda (10 taxa) \nthe calanoids (mainly Notodiaptomus iheringi) were more abundant, especially in warmer periods. Conversely, cyclo-\npoids had higher abundance in autumn and winter. The species Thermocyclops minutus and T. decipiens co-occurred, \nbut the first attained higher abundance. Some evidence of co-existence strategies between both species are consid-\nered. Cladocera (17 taxa) was never numerically dominant and the main taxa (Bosmina spp., Ceriodaphnia spp. and \nDiaphanosoma spp.) occurred almost the whole study period and did not present a seasonal pattern of fluctuation. \nDiaphanosoma (mainly D. birgei) attained the highest abundance among cladocerans. Most organisms were always \nfound at the surface, but they also occupy the whole water column, even in periods of stratified conditions and low \noxygen concentration in the bottom layers. Among the main zooplanktonic taxa, only Hexarthra avoids deep layers. \nAn exceptionally high concentration of Copepoda nauplii on the surface was influenced by low transparency, high \nconcentration of phytoplankton at this layer and low oxygen concentration at the bottom. In periods of higher reten-\ntion timevariability there was a more heterogeneous distribution of the zooplankton in the water column. The increase \nin the retention time seems also to favor the copepod development. Finally, some inter-decade changes are considered \non the basis of zooplankton assemblage structure observations.\n\nKeywords: tropical reservoir, fluctuation, Cladocera, Copepoda, Rotifera.\n\nFlutua\u00e7\u00f5es do zoopl\u00e2ncton na represa de Jurumirim  \n(S\u00e3o Paulo, Brasil): um estudo de tr\u00eas anos\n\nResumo\n\nDurante tr\u00eas anos consecutivos, foram feitas amostragens mensais do zoopl\u00e2ncton na zona lacustre (barragem) do \nreservat\u00f3rio de Jurumirim.

Introduction\n\nAll temporal changes that occur in ecosystems are \ncomplex and may be responsible for cyclic patterns of \nvariation. Different periods of time, such as days or \nyears, are reflected in the organism. If the individual \nlifetime is short, in relation to environmental changes, \noscillations or fluctuations of the population density are \nexpected. If individual life is long, or if the considered \nperiod is too short, the environmental modifications af-\nfect only the activities, rhythms and behavior, such as in \nfeeding and spatial distribution. This last kind of change \ndoes not influence the total number of individuals in the \npopulation (Margalef, 1974).\n\nThe continuous replacement of species is one of the \nmost remarkable characteristics of the plankton com-\nmunities, being the theme of several classical studies \n(Hutchinson, 1967; Edmondson and Litt, 1982). The \nperiod of time along a seasonal cycle determines con-\nspicuous modifications in the community structure, and \na real ecological succession with changes in the species \ncomposition is expected. Such modifications overlap \nbrief fluctuations and rhythms, partly due to great altera-\ntions in the environment among the seasons, and also due \nto the briefness of the life of the organisms (Hutchinson, \n1967; Margalef, 1974).\n\nThe search for patterns that explain plankton perio-\ndicity has been exhaustive, resulting in a huge literature \nand generating theoretical models especially applied \nto the phytoplankton dynamics in temperate regions \n(Reynolds, 1984). In the case of zooplankton, studies \nstill do not have a synthesis character, and generally the \nfactors that interfere in the temporal dynamics of the \npopulations have been analyzed individually.\n\nAccording to Talling and Lemoalle (1998), despite \nsome comprehensive studies in individual sites, more \ngeneralized approaches focusing on time-variability in \nthe tropics are scanty. For zooplankton, these authors \npointed out that even in environments with a well-de-\nfined stratification-mixing cycle (e.g. Lake Titicaca), the \nchanges in populations do not seem to be closely related \nto thermal regime, showing much irregularity in pat-\nterns.\n\nMore recently, new hypotheses have been posited \nto try to explain temporal variation patterns in plankton \ncommunities, such as the intermediate disturbance hy-\npothesis (Fl\u00f6der and Sommer, 2000), originally devel-\noped to explain the high diversity of coral reefs and trop-\nical forests (Connell, 1978). Most of these studies are \nrelated to phytoplankton assemblages (Reynolds, 1993), \nand few are related to zooplankton. Keppeler and Hardy \n(2004) concluded that the structure of tropical zooplank-\nton communities under the influence of intermediate per-\nturbations (e.g. water level fluctuation) has a disturbed \nsuccessional development, according to the level of the \nestablished diversity.\n\nIn artificial reservoirs, climatological forces (pre-\ncipitation, wind, solar radiation and temperature), and \nother proper mechanisms produced by the system opera-\ntion (residence time, water discharge, level fluctuations, \nadvection currents), lead to complex hydrodynamic pat-\nterns interfering in the spatial distribution and temporal \nsequence of the plankton organisms (Tundisi, 1990). \nThe man-induced variations in reservoirs can directly af-\nfect zooplankton and some population responses are not \nclearly discriminated from seasonal influence (Geraldes \nand Boavida, 2005). Besides the physical parameters, \nbiotic interactions such as fish predation affecting zoo-\nplankton fluctuation has also been intensively discussed \n(Urabe, 1990; Soares and Hayashi, 2005).\n\nRecently new approaches have been used in studies \nof the zooplankton of reservoirs in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo \n(southern Brazil), such as the responses to episodic ver-\ntical mixing promoted by the impact of subtropical cold \nfronts (Tundisi et al., 2004) and the influence of long \nterm degradation processes (biomass versus trophic con-\nditions) (Sendacz et al., 2006).\n\nFor certain reservoirs, such as the ones used for wa-\nter supply, the understanding of zooplankton seasonality \ncan be an important factor to be considered for quality \nmanagement purposes (Garc\u00eda et al., 2002). \n\nIn Jurumirim reservoir, considered in the present \nstudy, several limnological investigations have been \n\n\n\nThree-year study of zooplankton in reservoir\n\n3Braz. J. Biol., 69(1): 1-18, 2009\n\nIt has an area of 484 km2, and its maximum and mean \ndepths are of 40 and 12.9 m, respectively.\n\nDuring the study period the less warm months (mini-\nmum average air temperature of 10 \u00b0C) were August \n1993 and July 1994. The maximum monthly aver-\nage temperature (30 \u00b0C) occurred in November 1993, \nFebruary and December 1994, and January 1995. The \nmean annual precipitation for the three-year study was \n1,658 mm (Jurumirim reservoir Meteorological Station) \nwith the concentration of the rains in summer periods. \nThe winter is characterized as the dry period.\n\nAdditional limnological and climatological informa-\ntion of the reservoir during the study period is provided \nby Henry et al. (2006).\n\n3. Material and Methods\n\nThe fieldwork was carried out monthly (morning \nperiods) in the lacustrine-dam zone (approximate local \ndepth of 30 m) of the Jurumirim reservoir along three \nconsecutive years - from July, 1992 to July, 1995. There \nis no vegetation influence in this area, being representa-\ntive of a real pelagic condition. For qualitative analyses \nzooplankton samples were collected using vertical net \nhauls, and the quantitative ones through water filtration \n(300 L) by a motor pump at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 m, \nsince as it is a deep reservoir stratified in spring and sum-\nmer, it was expected to observe differences between the \nwater layers. For all samples a conical net of 50 \u00b5m of \nmesh size was used. Samples were fixed and preserved \nin 4% formaldehyde, and are deposited in the freshwater \ninvertebrate collection at the Department of Zoology of \nthe State University of S\u00e3o Paulo (campus of Botucatu). \n\nundertaken over recent years. In terms of temporal dy-\nnamics, the monthly variation of the thermal regime and \nstability, oxygen deficit (Henry 1992, 1993a) and prima-\nry production by phytoplankton (Henry, 1993b; Henry \net al., 2006); the influence of hydrological seasonality on \nseston sedimentation and transport (Henry and Maricato, \n1996); the space-temporal variation of phytoplankton \n(Henry et al., 1998), zooplankton (Nogueira, 2001), \nand physical-chemical variables (Nogueira et al., 1999), \nhave all been analyzed. Shorter periods of time have also \nbeen considered for zooplankton studies in Jurumirim: \nshort term (weekly) variability in rainy and dry periods \n(Panarelli et al., 2001) and vertical migration in nictem-\neral cycles (Nogueira and Panarelli, 1997). Some inter-\ndecade information (70\u2019s and 80\u2019s) on the composition \nand abundance of zooplankton has also been provided \n(Sampaio et al., 2002). \n\nThere is no comprehensive theory explaining the \nseasonal changes or successional trends for the zoo-\nplankton community in tropical and subtropical environ-\nments. Thus the present work, carried out in Jurumirim \nreservoir, intended to verify the occurrence of recurrent \ntemporal patterns (along three consecutive years) for the \nzooplankton assemblages. It aimed to contribute for a \nbetter understanding of the factors influencing the com-\npetitive ability of the different species.\n\n2. Study Area\n\nJurumirim is the first of a series of eleven reservoirs \nbuilt in the Paranapanema River, since the 50\u2019s, for elec-\ntric generation. The dam is located at 23\u00b0 12\u2019 17\u201d S and \n49\u00b0 13\u2019 19\u201d W, in S\u00e3o Paulo State (Brazil) (Figure 1). \n\nBrazil\n\nSP\n\n0 5 10 15 20 km\n\nScale 1: 250 000 \n\nRiver Paranapanema\n\n Jurumirim Reservoir\n\nRiver \nTaquari\n\nDam\n\nN\n\nS\n\nW E\n\nFigure 1.

Limnological variables\n\nFigure 2 shows monthly fluctuations of the theoreti-\ncal water retention time. The minimum value (181 days) \nwas recorded for February/93 and the maximum for \nDecember/93 (576 days). The average theoretical water \nretention time (RT) for Jurumirim reservoir during the \nstudy period was 258 days. Despite the strong seasonal \nprecipitation regime in this region, no clear pattern of \nvariation was observed for the water retention time. \nHowever, relatively low values were estimated every \nsummer (February/March, 1993; February/March, 1994; \nJanuary/February, 1995). Higher variability occurred \nover the first period of study (1992 and 1993) but for \n1994, the RT remained very high (above 464 days), ex-\ncept for the mid-summer months. After February 1995, \nthe values were around 350 days.\n\nChlorophyll values (water column mean) were gen-\nerally low (between 1 and 4 \u00b5g.L\u20131) during the whole \nstudy period (Figure 2). An increasing tendency was \nobserved in autumn/winter, and also in certain summer \nmonths (December, 1993 and January, 1994). \n\nWater transparency ranged from 1.37 m (April,1993) \nto 5.16 m (January, 1995) (Figure 3). In general, an in-\ncreasing transparency was observed in summer periods. \nNevertheless, a high transparency was also found in June \nand July, 1994.\n\nFor the quantitative analysis the zooplankton was count-\ned using sub samples. A minimum of 200 individuals \nwas considered in each sample or the total sample was \nanalyzed. \n\nFor representation purposes, it was considered the \nabundance in the euphotic zone for the most representa-\ntive zooplankton species (abundance and occurrence). \nThe graphs illustrating total zooplankton, cladocerans, \nrotifers and copepods considered the six different stud-\nied depths, showing the maximum and minimum densi-\nties, standard deviation and mean values.\n\nIn order to identify the influence of the environment \non the zooplankton dynamics, the following limnological \nvariables were analyzed: Secchi disk transparency, water \ntemperature (surface and bottom) (Toho Dentam ther-\nmistor), chlorophyll-a (0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 m) (cold \nacetone extraction) and dissolved oxygen analysis (0, 5, \n10, 15, 20 and 25 m) (Winkler method) (Golterman et al., \n1978). The theoretical water retention time (Stra\u0161kraba \net al., 1993) was estimated using data of water discharge \nat the dam (monthly mean) and the reservoir volume pro-\nvided by the electric company. Data on phytoplankton \nprimary production, rain precipitation and other limno-\nlogical variables were simultaneously obtained and ana-\nlyzed (Henry et al., 2006).\n\nAnalyses searching for statistical relation among \nthe studied variables (e.g. Pearson correlation, PCA and \nCCA) were performed, but did not produce significant \nresults in terms of correlation.

From this \nmonth on, the distribution became much more homoge-\nneous. This figure also shows the monthly fluctuation of \nabundance (mean water column values), which varied \nfrom 2,180 ind.m\u20133 (November, 1993) to 132,423 ind.m\u20133 \n(April, 1993).\n\nConsidering the relative abundance among the groups \n(Figure 7), Rotifera dominated during most of the study \nperiod, reaching more than 90% of the organisms (e.g. \nin September, 1992). The only period when Copepoda \n(considering all the development stages) prevailed was \nin autumn (58% of total zooplankton in May, 1994 and \n48% in May, 1995). Cladocera was never numerically \ndominant and their higher proportion was observed in the \nspring, 1994 and early summer, 1995, reaching the maxi-\nmum of 25% of the total organisms (January, 1995).\n\nFigures 8 and 9 show the fluctuation of the abun-\ndance of Rotifera and Cladocera, respectively. Due to \ntheir dominance, the rotifers had the same variation pat-\ntern seen for total zooplankton, with relatively higher \nvalues and also more heterogeneous vertical distribution \nin the first study period. Their mean abundance varied \nfrom 972 ind.m\u20133 (November, 1993) to 79,660 ind.m\u20133 \n(August, 1992). The abundance of rotifers varied very \nirregularly during almost the whole study period.\n\nThe cladocerans did not show a clear pattern of \ntemporal fluctuation, but a small decrease of the popu-\n\nFluctuations of surface and bottom temperature at \nthe sampling station showed a tendency to isothermic \nconditions during the autumn/winter and great differ-\nences in the water column during spring/summer peri-\nods (Figure 4). The lowest temperature was observed in \nAugust, 1994 (16.9 \u00b0C - bottom), and the maximum in \nJanuary, 1993 (26.7 \u00b0C - surface). The average of water \ntemperature at the surface and the bottom was, respec-\ntively, 22.3 and 19.9 \u00b0C.\n\nA clear seasonal pattern of variation was observed \nfor the dissolved oxygen concentrations (Figure 5). \nLower mean values for the water column occurred in \nsummer, with the minimum of 6 mg.L\u20131 in March, 1993, \nand higher values in winter, with the maximum mean \nvalue of 9 mg.L\u20131 in August, 1992 and August, 1994. The \noxygen range among depths followed the same tempo-\nral pattern with higher amplitude in summer (the highest \nin March, 1993) and lower in the winter (the lowest in \nAugust,1992).\n\n5.

J. Biol., 69(1): 1-18, 2009\n\nspatially complex with distinct longitudinal and lateral \ncompartments (Henry and Maricatto, 1996; Henry et al. \n1998; Nogueira et al., 1999). Another important feature \nof the reservoir is the association of its upper zone (70 to \n80 km far from the dam) to a group of adjacent ecosys-\ntems (marginal lagoons and riverine mouths), which has \na great importance in the biogeophysical processes and \nsupports a high biological diversity (e.g. Carvalho and \nSilva, 1999; Henry, 2003). \n\nThe lacustrine zone of the reservoir, near to the dam, \ncan be classified as oligotrophic (Henry et al., 1998; \nNogueira et al., 1999) and warm monomictic system \n(Henry, 1993a) with a hypolimnetic oxygen deficit at the \nend of the stratified period (late summer) (Henry, 1992).\n\nThe temporal fluctuation of the Jurumirim reservoir \nlimnological characteristics is mainly influenced by vari-\nation in the rains and water retention time (Henry et al., \n2006). The variation of the precipitation along the an-\nnual cycle is well defined, with rains concentrated in late \nspring and summer. During the study period this seasonal \npattern was very clear. The water retention time (RT) in \nJurumirim is high with the annual mean between 400 to \n600 days (Nogueira et al., 2005). However, variation in \ntotal water discharge and as a consequence in the RT is \nnot clearly defined, because it depends on the market de-\nmand for electricity and level control of the downstream \nreservoirs.\n\nDuring the study period the RT varied irregularly, but \nwith a certain decrease in the rainy periods (summer). The \nminimum RT that was estimated during the study period, \n181 days, is still long enough to affirm that Jurumirim, at \nleast the large region near the dam, is a typical lacustrine \nenvironment. This condition is quite different from other \nreservoirs in the basin, such as Salto Grande and Canoas \nI and II, where the mean RT is less than 2, 7 and 5 days, \nrespectively (Nogueira et al., 2005).\n\nThe influence of the seasonal rains on the studied re-\ngion of the reservoir is not immediate, due to the perma-\nnently high RT. Evidence of this fact is given by the wa-\nter transparency pattern. Higher transparency is observed \nin summer, the period of more intensive rains as said be-\nfore. That is because, as shown by Henry and Maricatto \n(1996), the sedimentation of most of the alloctonous ma-\nterial brought by rains occurs in the upper zones of the \nreservoir, where a conspicuous decrease in transparency \n(pulse effect) occurs in the rainy period (Nogueira et al., \n1999). The material that remains suspended, mostly fine \nmineral particles, will only be detected in the dam zone \nafter a certain time, maybe two or three months depend-\ning on the outflow management.\n\nMost values of chlorophyll (mean for the water \ncolumn) at the dam zone of Jurumirim reservoir were \naround or even lower than 2 \u00b5g.L\u20131. The oligotrophic \ncondition of this ecosystem and low availability of pri-\nmary trophic resources is certainly an important factor \ninterfering in the competitive processes among the zoo-\nplankton species.\n\nOxygen variation followed the well-marked pat-\ntern of temperature/circulation of the Reservoir (Henry, \n1993a). The high oxygenation of the water mass in \nwinter is related to the increase in the mixture rate be-\ntween the surface and the bottom layers, in addition to \nthe temperature decrease. The concentration of dissolved \noxygen only reached low values in the bottom, during \nsummer. Another factor that may also be associated to \nthe oxygen dynamics is the phytoplankton development, \nas an increasing tendency of the chlorophyll values in \nautumn and winter was observed. A similar pattern was \ndetected by Henry et al. (2006) when analyzing phy-\ntoplankton primary productivity data. The authors dis-\ncussed the results in relation to nutrient concentration \nand Z\n\nEU\n/Z\n\nMIX\n ratios. \n\nStatistical analysis (Pearson correlation) showed a \npositive correlation between chlorophyll and RT (e.g. \n1994 data), and between transparency and RT. In the \ncase of oxygen, there was an inverse tendency with the \ntemperature range (amplitude of variation) in the water \ncolumn. However, as the correlation analysis correlation \nscores were very low, the results were not presented. A \nPCA analysis (20 limnological variables) undertaken by \nHenry et al. (2006), for the same sampling period, re-\nvealed that the main factors influencing the variability \namong months were nutrient concentrations and the Z\n\nEU\n/\n\nZ\nMIX\n\n ratio. \n\n6.2. Zooplankton composition and seasonal fluctuation\n\nChanges in temperature might act as a trigger of \nseasonal processes, influencing the zooplankton directly \n(e.g. metabolic rates) or indirectly (e.g. modifications of \nthe phytoplankton structure). In temperate lakes there is \na noticeable decrease on zooplankton density in winter \nand increase and appearance of new species in other peri-\nods. However, this pattern is not so clear in tropical lakes \n(Arcifa et al., 1992), where factors such as precipitation \nregime and light penetration can be more important for \nseasonal dynamics (R\u00e1i and Hill, 1981). In Lake Parano\u00e1, \nan artificial reservoir in Bras\u00edlia (DF), it was observed a \nlower zooplankton density in the rainy period, and also an \nalternation on the seasonal occurrence of certain popula-\ntions of microcrustaceans, with Thermocyclops decipiens \n(Kiefer, 1929) being more abundant in the rainy season \nand Bosmina longirostris (O. F. M\u00fcller, 1785) (Cladocera) \nin the dry period (Pinto-Coelho, 1987).\n\nIn Jurumirim, rotifers were the most abundant or-\nganisms of zooplankton during almost the entire stud-\nied period. These small animals react faster than other \nzoological groups of freshwater zooplankton to changes \nin water conditions, due to their short development cy-\ncle (r-strategists), being considered as the group with \nmore sensibility to the physical and chemical changes \nthat occur in the environment (Gannon and Stemberger, \n1978; Infante, 1982). They can also develop numerous \npopulations using low quality food resources, such as \norganic detritus (Mangas and Garcia, 1991). The op-\nportunistic strategy of rotifers was reported by Nogueira \n\n\n\nThree-year study of zooplankton in reservoir\n\n15Braz. J. Biol., 69(1): 1-18, 2009\n\nand Matsumura-Tundisi (1996), who studied a seasonal \ncycle in a very different kind of reservoir, a small and \nshallow one (Monjolinho reservoir, S\u00e3o Carlos - SP). \nThe authors observed that the succession in plankton as-\nsemblages was very influenced by physical forces. The \ncombination of strong winds, high precipitation and low \nwater retention time (late spring and beginning of sum-\nmer) results in an absolute dominance of rotifers and fila-\nmentous diatoms in the plankton.\n\nAs a general rule the rotifers dominate zooplankton \nin Brazilian natural or artificial inland waters (Rocha \net al., 1995; Nogueira, 2001; Sendacz and Monteiro \nJunior, 2003). But it is important to consider that in terms \nof total zooplankton biomass, they can have only a minor \ncontribution (Matsumura-Tundisi et al., 1989).\n\nThe main taxa of Rotifera in Jurumirim were \nConochilus, mainly C. unicornis Rousselet, 1892 in \nspring, Hexartha spp. in summer, Keratella americana \nCarlin, 1943 and K. cochlearis, especially in summer and \nPolyarthra, mainly P. vulgaris Carlin, 1943, in all seasons.\n\nRotifers were not dominant only during a few months \nof the study period, when copepods were numerically \nmore abundant. Higher copepod abundance was associ-\nated to periods of increase in the water retention time, \nas seen between fall and spring of 1994. This could be \nrelated to the fact that these organisms have longer and \nmore complex biological cycle (k-strategists), requiring \nhigher environmental physical stability.\n\nThe species richness of Copepoda found in the \npresent study was similar to that of the mouth of the \nParanapanema river into the Jurumirim reservoir, includ-\ning two marginal lakes, (3 Calanoida and 6 Cyclopoida \ntaxa) (Casanova and Henry, 2004). A compilation of \ndifferent studies shows that Copepoda (Calanoida and \nCyclopoida of the plankton) in Jurumirim, including the \ndownstream stretch, is represented by 12 taxa (Panarelli \net al., 2003). \n\nCalanoida was more abundant in Jurumirim, in rela-\ntion to Cyclopoida, most of the time. Tundisi et al. (1990) \nstudying the eutrophic Barra Bonita Reservoir, detected \nthe dominance of Cyclopoida among Copepoda, sug-\ngesting that this group is more resistant to the decrease \nin the water quality. \n\nIn our study the abundance of Calanoida was es-\npecially high in late spring and summer. Conversely, a \nhigher proportion of Cyclopoida was observed in au-\ntumn and winter. \n\nAn analysis of spatial patterns (longitudinal) and \nzooplankton distribution in Jurumirim revealed that \nthe proportion of Calanoida increases towards the dam \n(Panarelli et al., 2003), showing that they are better suc-\nceeded in more lacustrine conditions. The authors also \nobserved that Calanoida relative abundance, in relation to \nCyclopoida, was higher in the rainy period. Abundance \npeaks of the large Calanoida Argyrodiaptomus furcatus \n(Sars, 1901) were related to higher temperatures and \nrains in the Lobo Reservoir (SP) (Rocha et al., 1995), \n\nand to oligotrophic regions in the Furnas Reservoir \n(Corgosinho and Pinto-Coelho, 2006).\n\nA higher abundance of nauplii, in relation to copepo-\ndids and adults, was observed for Cyclopoida. In the case \nof Calanoida there was a high proportion of juveniles. \nThese facts may indicate the occurrence of a high rate of \nmortality during the cyclopoids larval phases.\n\nAccording to Rocha et al. (1995) and Silva and \nMatsumura-Tundisi (2005) the trophic state of a lake or res-\nervoir seems to determine what species of Thermocyclops \nwill be found. In oligotrophic waters T. minutus (Lowndes, \n1934) is more frequent while in eutrophic waters it is re-\nplaced by T. decipiens (Kiefer, 1929). In mesotrophic \nlakes both species would be found together or in a sea-\nsonally alternating pattern. Pinto-Coelho (1987), studying \nLake (reservoir) Parano\u00e1 (Bras\u00edlia, DF) had already con-\nsidered that T. decipiens (Kiefer, 1929) had a higher capa-\nbility to grow in more eutrophic conditions, represented \nin that case by the introduction of allocthonous material \nduring the rainy period. \n\nThe co-occurrence of T. minutus (Lowndes, 1934) and \nT. decipiens (Kiefer, 1929), with T. minutus reaching high-\ner abundance, could confirm the transitional state between \noligotrophic to oligo-mesotrophic condition of Jurumirim \nas proposed by Nogueira et al. (2002). Coincidence in ma-\njor abundance peaks of these species was not observed, \nindicating a temporal segregation between them. As ob-\nserved by Panarelli et al. (2001), T. minutus (Lowndes, \n1934) was more abundant in the dry period. \n\nA spatial segregation, among depths, in the same \nperiod, was also considered as a strategy of coexistence \nfor these species by Nogueira and Panarelli (1997), in a \nstudy of zooplankton vertical migration in Jurumirim.\n\nIt is interesting to note that in the 70\u2019s T.  decipiens \n(Kiefer, 1929) was found to be the most frequent Cyclopoid \nin the reservoirs of Paranapanema (Sampaio et al., 2002).\n\nCladocera was never numerically dominant and the \nmain taxa, Bosmina, Ceriodaphnia and Diaphanosoma, \noccurred in almost the whole study period and did not \npresent a seasonal pattern of fluctuation. Diaphanosoma \n(mainly D. birgei Korineck, 1981) reached the highest \nabundance.\n\nThe composition of Copepoda and Cladocera is \nsimilar to the ones found in material previously sam-\npled in Jurumirim (Nogueira, 2001; Sampaio et al., \n2002; Matsumura-Tundisi and Tundisi, 2003) indicat-\ning that there was little change in the plankton micro-\ncrustaceans from the 70\u2019s to 90\u2019s. However, samples \ncollected more recently in Jurumirim show that the zoo-\nplankton has experienced fast and pronounced modifica-\ntions in structure, especially for copepod assemblages. \nThe calanoids Argyrodiaptomus furcatus (Sars, 1901) \nand Notodiaptomus conifer (Sars, 1901), two species \nof major importance in the past (Sampaio et al., 2002; \nMatsumura-Tundisi and Tundisi, 2003) nowadays are \nrare (A. furcatus (Sars, 1901)) or seem to have become re-\ngionally extinct (N. conifer (Sars, 1901)) (Nogueira et al., \nin prep.). Data of this study as well the one of Nogueira \n\n\n\nSartori, LP. et al.\n\n16 Braz. J. Biol., 69(1): 1-18, 2009\n\n(2001), show that these species were firstly replaced by \nN. iheringi Wright, 1935 and presently N. c.f. henseni \nDahl, 1894 is the dominant calanoid (Nogueira et al., in \npreparation). G\u00fcntzel (2000) also observed the substitu-\ntion of A.  furcatus (Sars, 1901) by N. iheringi Wright, \n1935 in Nova Avanhangava reservoir (Tiet\u00ea River, S\u00e3o \nPaulo) as a consequence of the eutrophication process in \nthe last two decades.\n\n6.3. Zooplankton vertical distribution\n\nDespite the permanently high values, the variabil-\nity of the water retention time in Jurumirim may have \na certain influence on the zooplankton assemblages. \nHigher variability in the vertical distribution of the total \nzooplankton that occurred during the first 20 months of \nstudy can be related with higher variability in the water \nretention time in the same period. Nogueira and Panarelli \n(1997) had already observed that the behavior of zoo-\nplankton vertical migration toward the surface during the \nnight is more distinctive in winter, when RT is higher. \n\nThe seasonal stratification regime of Jurumirim \nreservoir and its effects on the limnological conditions \nseems not to be an imperative factor controlling the ver-\ntical distribution of the zooplankton organisms, as most \nspecies could be found in the bottom layer during all \nseasons.\n\nFor copepods, homogeneous distributions in the wa-\nter column were observed even in periods of the year \nwith great differences between surface and bottom tem-\nperatures (e.g. January-February, 1995 for cyclopoids, \nand February, 1995 for calanoids). The most heterogene-\nous distribution occurred in autumn, April, 1993, espe-\ncially due to the nauplii concentrations on the surface \n(about 73,000 ind.m\u20133 for Cyclopoida and 21,000 ind.m\u20133 \nfor Calanoida). In this case a combination of factors cer-\ntainly had a strong influence determining this distribu-\ntional pattern. The transparency was the lowest one con-\nsidering the three year period (less than 1.5 m) and there \nwas a high concentration of phytoplankton on the surface \n(6.46 \u00b5g.L\u20131 of chlorophyll). Thus, the animal distribu-\ntion on this occasion was possibly associated to the feed-\ning resources distribution. It is also important to consider \nthat at this time of the year, the end of thermal strati-\nfication period, there was still a relatively low oxygen \nconcentration in the bottom layer (less than 5 mg.L\u20131), \ndespite the relatively low difference in the surface-bot-\ntom temperature (c.a. 2 \u00b0C in 30 m depth). This could be \nan additional factor limiting a deeper distribution of the \nzooplankton organisms. \n\nRotifers were more abundant at the surface. However, \nthey can occupy the whole water column. Conochilus, for \ninstance, had several peaks of abundance in the bottom \n(up to 40,000 ind.m3), which suggests that the conditions \nin the hypolimnion do not limit the distribution of this \ngenus, mainly represented by C. unicornis Rousselet, \n1892. Among the main taxa of rotifers in Jurumirim, the \nonly one that avoids the bottom layer is Hexarthra.\n\nCladocera were also found in higher abundance at \nthe surface, but the main taxa were always found in the \nbottom as well and, in the case of Diaphanosoma, oc-\ncasionally in relatively high abundance.\n\n7. Conclusions\nSeasonal effects on the limnological features of the \n\nJurumirim reservoir (e.g. thermal regime, oxygen distribu-\ntion, phytoplankton biomass) were verified by this study. \nHowever, the influence of seasonality on the fluctuation of \nthe zooplankton composition and abundance was not clear. \nRotifers were the most abundant organisms with certain \nseasonal alternation in the abundance peaks of the main \ntaxa (Conochilus unicornis Rousselet, 1892, Keratella \namericana Carlin, 1943, K. cochlearis (Gosse, 1851) and \nHexarthra spp.), except for Polyarthra (mainly P. vulgaris \nCarlin, 1943). Only occasionally copepods (including all \ndevelopmental stages) were numerically dominant. Higher \ncopepod abundance was positively associated to periods \nof increasing water retention time. Among the Copepoda, \ncalanoids (mainly N. iheringi Wright, 1935) were more \nabundant, especially in warmer periods. Conversely, cy-\nclopoids had higher abundance in autumn and winter. The \nspecies Thermocyclops minutus (Lowndes, 1934) and T. \ndecipiens (Kiefer, 1929) co-occurred, but the first attained \nhigher abundance, which indicates the oligo-mesotrophic \ncondition of the reservoir. Cladocera was never numeri-\ncally dominant and the main taxa (Bosmina, Ceriodaphnia \nand Diaphanosoma) occurred during almost the whole \nstudy period and did not present a seasonal pattern of fluc-\ntuation. Diaphanosoma (mainly D. birgei Korineck, 1981) \nattained the highest abundance. Most organisms were al-\nways found at the surface, but they also occupy the whole \nwater column, even in periods of stratified conditions \u2013 \nlow oxygen concentration in the bottom. Among the main \nzooplanktonic taxa, only Hexarthra avoided deeper layers. \nAn exceptionally high concentration of Copepoda nauplii \non the surface was influenced by low transparency, high \nconcentration of phytoplankton in this layer and low oxy-\ngen concentration at the bottom. Despite the permanently \nhigh values (more than 180 days), the variability of the \nwater retention time (RT) in Jurumirim may have a cer-\ntain influence on the zooplankton. In periods of higher RT \nvariability, there was a more heterogeneous distribution of \nzooplankton in the water column. The increase in RT also \nseems to favour copepod development.\n\nAcknowledgements \u2014 This study was supported by FAPESP \n(Thematic project coordinated by Professor J. G.
