A major limitation resides in the paucity of direct Deccan volcanism markers and in the geologically short interval where both impact and volcanism occurs, making it hard to evaluate their contributions to the mass extinction. Recently, a new marker for the Deccan Traps has been found just below the KT boundary at Bidart and Gubbio and is identified as aeolian akaganeite interpreted to be formed by interaction of Deccan aerosols with the high atmosphere and latter transported to Bidart and Gubbio via the stratosphere. This akaganeite occurs within an interval of low magnetic susceptibility (MS) interpreted to result from the dissolution of detrital magnetite by Deccan-induced acid rains. Here we conducted an environmental magnetic study of several KT sections worldwide, marine (Tethys) and continental (India) in order to: i) verify the presence of the low MS interval and akaganeite in sediments close and distal to the Deccan and ii) unravel the associated paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic changes. In Bidart and Gubbio, our results confirmed the presence of the low magnetic susceptibility interval coincident with the presence of akaganeite and show that it well corresponds to a loss of detrital magnetite. In Uruxa and Sopelana (Basque Country), the results are inconclusive, probably due to the tectonic deformation and chemical alteration that affected the area. In Iran, we located for the first time the position of the KTB, which is well marked by an abrupt shift in MS values between the Maastrichtian marls and the Danian carbonates. However, no low MS interval has been found there. In the continental (lacustrine) sediments interbedded within the Deccan lavas, higher weathering rates are observed in the Podgawan section (Phase 2) and inferred from the presence of more than four magnetic phases identified after unmixing Isothermal Remanent Magnetization curves. In this section, we found an enigmatic level of high MS corresponding to an abrupt change in facies and color, namely the presence of a black coal level capped by reddish clays, which may be formed by the action of wildfire just after the bolide impact (KTB). This new discovery may definitively link the age of the impact with the age of the Deccan Phase 2.\nKey-words: Deccan volcanism, akaganeite, environmental magnetism, mass extinction, KTB\nResumo\nO vulcanismo da Prov\u00edncia Magm\u00e1tica do Deccan, na \u00cdndia, foi um dos mais intensos na hist\u00f3ria da Terra, e extende-se por uma \u00e1rea compar\u00e1vel \u00e0 da Fran\u00e7a com montanhas com cerca de 3500 m de altura. A partir dos anos 80, o Deccan foi considerado como sendo o respons\u00e1vel pela extin\u00e7\u00e3o em massa do Cret\u00e1ceo-Terci\u00e1rio (KT), que coincide com a extin\u00e7\u00e3o dos dinossauros e com o impacto do Chicxulub na Prov\u00edncia do Yucatan, M\u00e9xico. Apesar do consenso de que o impacto e o vulcanismo do Deccan ocorreram num intervalo de tempo restricto, a contribui\u00e7\u00e3o de cada evento na extin\u00e7\u00e3o em massa do KT \u00e9 ainda mal constringido. A grande limita\u00e7\u00e3o passa por n\u00e3o existirem ainda marcadores directos que liguem o vulcanismo do Deccan \u00e0 extin\u00e7\u00e3o em massa e a proximidade temporal entre o evento do Chicxulub e do Deccan, o que torna complicado avaliar qual foi o respons\u00e1vel pela mesma.\nRecentemente, foi descoberto que o Deccan ocorreu em tr\u00eas principais mega pulsos, que chamamos de fase 1, 2 e 3. Segundo Chenet et al. (2007) a fase 2 ocorreu h\u00e1 cerca de 65.0\u00b10.3 Ma e foi respons\u00e1vel por cerca de 80% do total de lava, enquanto a fase 1 e 3 juntas contribu\u00edram com os restantes 20%. Baseado em f\u00f3sseis de plantas, Wilf et al. (2003) descobriu a ocorr\u00eancia de 2 epis\u00f3deos de aquecimento global, o maior durante o final do Maastrichtiano e que ter\u00e1 terminado alguns milhares de anos antes da fronteira Cret\u00e1cico-Terci\u00e1rio (KTB). Robinson et al. (2009) correlacionou um diminui\u00e7\u00e3o na raz\u00e3o 187Os/188Os no final do Maastrichtiano com a fase 2 do Deccan e valores negativos de \u00f413C reflectem um volume enorme de CO2 emitido para a atmosfera. Tal provocou um ambiente de stress clim\u00e1tico que poder\u00e1 ter contribu\u00eddo para a extin\u00e7\u00e3o em massa do KT. Existe deste modo um consenso elevado que a fase mais activa do Deccan aconteceu pouco antes do KTB. O problema reside na nossa incapacidade de localizar com precis\u00e3o a posi\u00e7\u00e3o estratigr\u00e1fica do vulcanismo do Deccan nos sedimentos marinhos onde est\u00e1 preservado o limite KT. Efectivamente, se o impacto \u00e9 bem marcado em sequ\u00eancias marinhas do mundo inteiro pelo n\u00edvel de ir\u00eddium, os marcadores do Deccan (ejecta, microesferas, etc.) limitam-se as \u00e1reas geogr\u00e1ficas pr\u00f3ximas \u00e0 prov\u00edncia magm\u00e1tica.\nRecentemente, Font et al. (2011) prop\u00f4s um novo marcador para o vulcanismo do Deccan em sedimentos marinhos distantes. Nesse trabalho foi descoberto um intervalo de baixa susceptibilidade magn\u00e9tica precisamente antes do KTB na sec\u00e7\u00e3o de Bidart. Nesse intervalo as curvas de Magnetiza\u00e7\u00e3o Remanescente Isot\u00e9rmica (MRI) detectaram uma componente de alta coercividade, um mineral que foi posteriormente identificado usando microscopia electr\u00f3nica como sendo akaganeite (Font et al., 2013). Os autores interpretaram a forma\u00e7\u00e3o da akaganeite como sendo o produto de uma reac\u00e7\u00e3o entre a pluma vulc\u00e2nica e a alta atmosfera. Modelos num\u00e9ricos recentemente mostraram tamb\u00e9m que no caso de Deccan, apesar de n\u00e3o ser um vulcanismo explosivo, a quantidade de CO2 e de calor \u00e9 tal, que cria uma pluma vulc\u00e2nica capaz de ultrapassar a tropopausa. Sendo que a velocidade de transporte dos aeross\u00f3is na estratosfera \u00e9 muito maior que na troposfera, isto explicaria o seu transporte at\u00e9 Bidart (Ba\u00eda da Biscaia) e Gubbio (It\u00e1lia). A descoberta da akaganeite e do intervalo de baixa susceptibilidade magn\u00e9tica tem implica\u00e7\u00f5es cruciais na avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da contribui\u00e7\u00e3o do Deccan na extin\u00e7\u00e3o em massa do KT, de tal maneira que este modelo precisa ser testado e aplicado a outras sec\u00e7\u00f5es KT do mundo.\nNeste trabalho us\u00e1mos o magnetismo ambiental em sec\u00e7\u00f5es KT marinhas com o objectivo de verificar a presen\u00e7a do intervalo de baixa susceptibilidade magn\u00e9tica e da akaganeite noutras sec\u00e7\u00f5es KT do mundo (Gubbio, Ir\u00e3o, Sopelana e Uruxa). De modo a comparar a assinatura magn\u00e9tica de sedimentos marinhos e continentais da idade da fase 2 e a inferir acerca das condi\u00e7\u00f5es paleoambientais, foram igualmente analisadas sec\u00e7\u00f5es de sedimentos lacustres provenientes da prov\u00edncia magm\u00e1tica do Deccan. Os m\u00e9todos utilizados basearam-se em aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o de dados de Magnetiza\u00e7\u00e3o Remanescente Isot\u00e9rmica (MRI), que foram posteriormente tratados com o software da Kruiver et al. (2001), susceptibilidade magn\u00e9tica (SM), curvas termomagn\u00e9ticas e dados de DRS, isto \u00e9, espectrofotometria da reflec\u00e7\u00e3o difusa.\nJ\u00e1 os resultados mais importantes nos sedimentos continentais da \u00cdndia dizem respeito \u00e0 sec\u00e7\u00e3o de Podgawan, onde os sedimentos foram depositados na fase 2 do Deccan. Nessa sec\u00e7\u00e3o, na an\u00e1lise das curvas MRI usando o tratamento CLG proposto por Kruiver et al. (2001) observa-se a presen\u00e7a de v\u00e1rias (entre 4 a 5) componentes mineral\u00f3gicas. Essas componentes s\u00e3o geralmente de baixa coercividade, o que nos leva a interpretar como sendo magnetite com v\u00e1rios tamanhos de gr\u00e3o. Essa heterogeneidade ter\u00e1 resultado de uma intensa eros\u00e3o/altera\u00e7\u00e3o da magnetite provocada por um ambiente de stress (pCO2 elevadas, chuvas \u00e1cidas, por exemplo). Uma an\u00e1lise \u00e0s mesmas amostras feita por Fantasia (2013) concluiu que \u00e9 precisamente em Podgawan que os \u00edndices de altera\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica (CIA) s\u00e3o mais elevados, o que \u00e9 concordante com a nossa interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o. Igualmente a partir da sec\u00e7\u00e3o de Podgawan foi poss\u00edvel sugerir a presen\u00e7a eventual do limite KTB marcada por uma mudan\u00e7a brusca da cor e da mineralogia magn\u00e9tica dos sedimentos num espa\u00e7o de apenas 13 cm. Estes n\u00edveis correspondem a sucess\u00e3o estratigr\u00e1fica de um n\u00edvel preto de carv\u00e3o seguido de argilas vermelhas. O n\u00edvel de carv\u00e3o preto pode ter sido depositado ap\u00f3s os inc\u00eandios gerados pela radia\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00e9rmica libertada durante o impacto do Chicxulub, enquanto que o n\u00edvel vermelho corresponde a um n\u00edvel rico em pigmentos de hematite e sem mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica. Fotografias de microscopia electr\u00f3nica deste n\u00edvel vermelho, recentemente publicadas, mostram que o mesmo pode ser resultado da forte altera\u00e7\u00e3o de superf\u00edcie devido a aus\u00eancia da cobertura vegetal. Se esta hip\u00f3tese se confirmar no futuro, ser\u00e1 a primeira evid\u00eancia indiscut\u00edvel que demonstra que a Fase 2 do Deccan \u00e9 quase s\u00edncrona com o impacto do Chicxulub.\nPalavras-chave: Cret\u00e1cico-Terci\u00e1rio, vulcanismo do Deccan, extin\u00e7\u00e3o em massa, impacto, magnetismo ambiental.\n1.\tIntroduction...............................................................................1\n2.\tGeological\tSettings......................................................................5\n2.1\tBasque\tCountry.......................................................................5\n2.1.1\tBidart.............................................................................5\n2.1.2\tSopelana and Uruxa.................................................................6\n2.2\tGubbio.................................................................................6\n2.3\tIran...................................................................................7\n2.4\tIndia..................................................................................8\n3.\tMethods....................................................................................8\n3.1\tSample preparation.....................................................................8\n3.2\tMagnetic Susceptibility................................................................9\n3.2.1\tMass specific Bulk Susceptibility..................................................9\n3.2.2\tFrequent dependent susceptibility\t(Kfd)............................................9\n3.3\tIsothermal Remanent Magnetization\t(IRM)..............................................10\n3.3.1\tCumulative Log-Gaussian Functions.................................................10\n3.3.2\tS-ratio...........................................................................11\n3.1\tThermomagnetic curves.................................................................11\n3.2\tDiffuse Reflectance Spectrophotometry\t(DRS)...........................................12\n3.2.1\tThe first derivative of reflectance\tspectra.......................................12\n4.\tMarine\tsections.........................................................................13\n4.1\tResults...............................................................................13\n4.1.1\tBidart............................................................................13\n4.1.2\tBasque Country....................................................................14\n4.1.3\tGubbio............................................................................16\n4.1.4\tIran .............................................................................18\n4.2\tDiscussion ...........................................................................19\n5.\tContinental sections (India) .............................................................21\n5.1\tResults.........................................................................21\n5.1.1\tAnjar.......................................................................21\n5.1.2\tDhapewada...................................................................22\n5.1.3\tDaiwal River................................................................24\n5.1.4\tPodgawan....................................................................25\n5.2\tDiscussion......................................................................26\n6.\tConclusions........................................................................29\n7.\tAcknowledgements...................................................................29\n8.\tReferences.........................................................................30\n9.\tAttatchments ......................................................................33\n1. Introduction\nThe Deccan Traps volcanism is one of the most important Large Igneous Province (LIP) in Earth's history. This importance is recorded today in India, where the exposures of lava cover an area comparable to the size of France and form mountain peaks of 3500 m high despite the erosion suffered through the years. Some of the biggest eruptions spread about 1500 km across India, forming the longest lava flows known on Earth (Self et al., 2008). Due to its magnitude, some scientists pointed the Deccan volcanism as the cause (or at least the major contributor) of the Cretaceous-Tertiary (KT) mass extinction (Courtillot et al., 1986).\nWhen Alvarez et al. (1980) discovered an Iridium anomaly in a thin clay layer at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (KTB), a new theory for the KT mass extinction was born. Iridium is commonly found in extra-terrestrial material (asteroids, comets, cosmic dust or impact ejecta), but very rare on Earth. Alvarez et al. (1980) thus suggest that the mass extinction was attributed to a bolide impact. The impact theory was further reinforced by the discovery in early 1990s of the Chicxulub crater (Hildebrand et al., 1991) and the impact spherule ejecta in Haiti and NE Mexico (Izett et al., 1991). Despite the large acceptation of the impact theory by the scientific community, it has been challenged by proponents of the idea that the Deccan Magmatic province may have contributed or even triggered the KT mass extinction.\nFig. 1 - The Deccan Traps at India (Photo: Steve Self).\nThe crater and the impact spherules discovery proved that an impact occurred, undoubtedly. However, there were still problems dating the Chicxulub impact to confirm that it was precisely of a KT age (i.e. mass extinction boundary). Impact craters are difficult to date with high precision, so the first impact dates were based on 39Ar/40Ar ages. But this method still have about \u00b11% of error, which may lead to a total error of \u00b1500 ky for the KTB, an uncertainty that is too large to identify the Chicxulub impact as KT age. Additionally, most of the impact theory is based on the presence of a sandstone complex that has been found at NE Mexico between the impact spherule layer (ISL) and the Iridium layer (Fig. 2). Supposedly, the ISL should be a marker of the KTB as the spherules are result of the immediate deposition of the impact ejecta emissions, together with the Iridium layer. The sandstone complex was therefore explained as being the result of mega-tsunami waves generated by the impact, with the Iridium settling during the next weeks (Smit et al. (1992)).\nFig. 2 - The Sandstone Complex found in a section at NE Mexico, between the ISL and the KTB (Gerta Keller, Earth Life, 2012).\nHowever, the mega-tsunami theory has been questioned when Adatte et al. (1996) performed a detailed sedimentologic analysis of the sandstone complex in several sections in USA and Mexico, which revealed long-term deposition with multiple storm-related erosion, suggesting a sea-level imprint and so a much larger deposition time for the sandstone complex. The sea-level fall also explains some impact spherules found in the sandstone complex, during Late Maastrichtian (bellow KPB), because sea-level changes are associated with strong erosion, transport and re-deposition of sediments. These results indicate that if the ISL has not the same age than the Iridium anomaly, and if the sandstone complex located between them is not a mega-tsunami but encompassed a larger interval of deposition time, then either two bolide impacts must be evocated or the Chicxulub must predate the KTB. On this base, Keller et al. (2003) suggested that Chicxulub impact must predate the KTB. If the relation between the Chicxulub impact, the Iridium anomaly and the mass extinction is hard to unravel in continental regions close to the impact, it is even harder for distal marine sections. Indeed, if the mass extinction is not well record in continental section (due to erosion and absence of well-dated fossils), it is well marked in marine sections by a typical negative anomaly of 513C and by abrupt change in planktonic foraminifera (Keller et al., 2008). In these marine sections, the Chicxulub impact is well identified by the peak in Iridium but there is no mineralogical or geochemical marker for the Deccan.\nA crucial problem is the age of Deccan volcanism. Recently, Chenet et al. (2007, 2008) propose that Deccan volcanism occurred in three short mega-pulses, called Phase 1, 2 and 3. The second pulse is responsible for nearly 80% of the total Deccan eruptions, with the first and third pulse contributing together for 20% (Fig. 3). The authors calculated a mean age of 67.5 Ma for the Phase 1; 65.0\u00b10.3 Ma for the Deccan phase 2, that corresponds to the C29r (magnetic polarity data); and 64.7 Ma for the Phase 3 and corresponding to the boundary between chron 29n and 29r. Based on the record of the paleosecular variations of individual lava flows, Chenet et al. (2008) suggest a very short eruption duration for the Deccan Phase 2 (on the order of thousands of years). These huge volumes of lava and associated CO2 and acid aerosol emissions should have got a critical impact on the biosphere.\nFig. 3 -The age and relative thickness of Deccan lava flows for its three different phases (Chenet et al. 2007)\nEven if direct markers of the Deccan effect are still lacking, there are several indirect evidences that suggest the Deccan Phase 2 precede the KTB by some 100-200 kyr (Fig. 4). Based on fossil plant material, Wilf et al. (2003) detected a warming event (with an abrupt increase of 2-4\u00b0C) at the late Maastrichtian, which ended ~20-50 kyr before the KTB. Stable carbon and oxygen isotopes from paleosol carbonates indicate the occurrence of two greenhouse episodes with high atmospheric CO2 levels, at 70 to 69 Ma and 500 kyr prior to KTB, respectively. Additionally, a major drop in the marine 187Os/188Os record in chron 29r at different geographic locations suggests a correlation between the end-Maastrichtian warming event and the Deccan Phase 2 (Robinson et al., 2009). Therefore, there is some consensus that the Deccan phase-2 occurred just before the KTB.\nGubbio, Italy\nAge (Ma)\nAge (Ma)\nAge (Ma) Q\nSpecies richness\n30\t60\nKPB\n3 rd phase\n__ Estimated mean annual temperature \u00b0C\n400\t800\t1200\t1600\nAtmospheric CO2 (ppmV)\nT' phase (-68-67 Ma)\nFig. 4 - Global-scale correlations of the Bidart and Gubbio sections with paleoenvironmental proxies for referenced KTB sections worldwide (Font et al., 2011)\n200\t\n165\t\n100\t\n40\t\n10\t\n150\t\n25\t\n25\t\n150\t\nVolume\n(xlO3 km3)\nThe main problem thus resides in our incapacity to locate the stratigraphic position of sediments deposited during the Deccan Phase 2. This is due to the lack of direct mineralogical indicators since volcanic markers, such as aerosols or ejecta, are generally restricted to the vicinity of the crater. However, a recent study using environmental magnetism show an abrupt decrease of the magnetic susceptibility (MS) just below the KTB together with the presence of an enigmatic Cl-bearing iron oxide identified by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM, Fig.5). In this interval, Isothermal Remanent Magnetization (IRM) showed the presence of a very coercive phase consistent with antiferromagnetic akaganeite and a drastic decrease in magnetite content characterizing the low MS interval. This mineral is proposed to be akaganeite (Font et al., 2013), and is now regarded as a possible Deccan volcanism marker. A model for the akaganeite formation had been suggested as being the result of the interaction between the volcanic plume aerosols with the upper atmosphere. The akaganeite would have been transported through the stratosphere (Kaminski et al., 2010) and deposited in Bidart, far from the original volcanic source. A numeric model of alteration suggests that a dissolution mechanism in the continents may explain the magnetite loss (low MS interval) in the interval where akaganeite has been found. This method is highly promising to localize the Deccan Phase-2 in sedimentary sections and needs to be applied in other KT sections around the world.\nDetrital titanomagnetite\nCl-bearing specular iron oxide\nDetrital titanomagnetite\nCl-bearing specular iron oxide\nkeV\no\nu\ni\u2014_IU\u00cd keV\nkeV\n\n\nThe main objective of this work is to study the magnetic mineralogy of some KT sections worldwide (Gubbio in Italy, Galanderud in Iran, Bidart, Uruxa and Sopelana in the Basque Country) in order to verify the presence of akaganeite and of a low MS interval that can be correlated to Deccan phase 2. In addition we investigate lacustrine sediments (Daiwal River, Dhapewada, Anjar and Podgawan) interstratified within the Deccan lavas (Phase 1 and Phase 2) from India in order to check for the presence of akaganeite in very proximal section but also to unravel local paleoenvironmental conditions (such as acid rains) in the vicinity of the Deccan. Our results will bring new insights in the problematic of the Deccan volcanism and its role on KT mass extinction.\n2.\tGeological Settings\n2.1\tBasque Country\n2.1.1\tBidart\nThe Bidart section is considered one of the most complete KT sections in Europe. It belongs to the Basque-Cantabric basin, a deep sea basin. The sedimentation is hemipelagic or pelagic, with the dominance of marls or calcareous marls in the Maastrichtian period while biogenic limestones compose the sedimentation during the Danian. The KTB is easily identified by the typical Iridium anomaly, well preserved in the section and located at the base of the dark clay layer (Bonte et al., 1984). The sedimentation rate is 4.3 cm/kyr for the Maastrichtian and is unknown for the Danian (Vonhof 1997).\nThe low MS interval described by Font et al. (2011) is located in the first 50 cm below the KTB and include an interval where color change from grey to red-yellow. The red color may be due to presence of pigmentary hematite, while the yellow color is interpreted to be due to presence of akaganeite (Torrent and Bardon, 2002).\nFor the present study, the Bidart section has been resampled by focusing on the low MS interval. More than 100 samples has been collected in the field, funded by a FCT project on Volcanism and Mass Extinctions (ref. PTDC/CTE-GIX/117298/2010), and provided by my supervisor Eric Font. Block samples were further cut into small plate-like samples in laboratory (Fig. 6).\nFig. 6 - Geological settings and biostratigraphy of the Bidart section. a, Palaeoenvironmental context of the Biscay Bay. b, The Erretegia Beach showing the white-pink Danian limestones and the Maastrichtian marls cut by a fault. c, The K-Pg boundary showing d, the typical dark clay layer and the yellow-red interval of low MS values in the upper Maastrichtian. e, Example of hand block collected at the outcrop. f, Example of a block cut into small plates, by using a non-magnetic dremel-saw, for subsequent magnetic analyses (modified from Font et al., 2013).\n2.1.2\tSopelana and Uruxa\nFig. 7 - Pictures of the Sopelana section (A) and the Uruxa section (B) during the field trip to Bilbao.\nThe analyzed sedimentary sections in the Basque Country (Sopelana and Uruxa) were formed in the Basque-Cantabric basin, the same as Bidart. Therefore, the characteristics of these sections are similar, with the presence of hemipelagic limestones above the KTB (Danian) and red/grey marls during the Maastrichtian. The Sopelana section is localized in the north coast of Bilbao, Spain. This section is affected by reverse and strike-slip faults in the late Cretaceous period, what may cause stratigraphic repetitions (Rodriguez-Tovar et al., 2011). The Uruxa section is located near the village of Gernika-Lumo, about 20-30 km East from Bilbao. This section is not very well studied. The KTB is well identified in both sections by the Iridium anomaly.\nThe number of collected samples was near 50 for each section (Sopelana and Uruxa) and the sampling interval varied from 2 cm to 20 cm.\n2.2\tGubbio\nKTB\nL______W SJ\nFig. 8 - Gubbio section picture, showing the white limestones under the KTB.\nThe Gubbio section is located in the Umbria-Marche Apennines, north from the town Gubbio, central Italy. It is composed mainly by pink to red limestones and marly limestones that have been thoroughly bioturbated and compacted prior to cementation, except an interval 20-50 cm thick bellow the KTB, which is constituted by white bleached limestone. The KTB is well identified by the presence of the Iridium level (Cronholm et al., 2007). At the late Cretaceous and early Paleocene the Gubbio/Umbria-Marche basin had a depth between 1500 and 2500 m, according to agglutinated foraminifera. The sedimentary rate of the basin at late Creataceous was calculated to be 4 to 6 mm/yr, becoming lower in Paleocene, with 2-3 mm/yr.\nSamples from the Gubbio section have been provided by Prof. Brooks B. Ellwood from the University of Florida (USA) and correspond to those studied in Ellwood et al. (2003). The number of samples is 100 and with a mean sampling interval of 5 cm.\nThe low MS interval at Gubbio is also featured by a characteristic changes in color from pink (with hematite) to white (Fig. 8). Such change in color has been interpreted by Lowrie et al. (1990) to correspond to secondary processes such as the percolation of reducing fluids, probably with origin on the organic matter resultant from the KT mass extinction. Akaganeite was found by Font et al. (2011) in the white levels.\n2.3\tIran\nThe Galanderud section is located in the Alborz mountains about 25 km south of the Royan city and southwest of Noor province, Iran. Its sediments cover the upper part of the Cenomanian (Cretaceous) until the Miocene. The Maastrichtian sediments consist in gray to brown pelagic marls, interbedded with marly limestones. Marly sediments are rich in foraminifera, ostracods and other microfossils including echinoids and inoceramids. An estimative of the KTB position is a transition from brown to dark brown marls at the end of Maastrichtian and a sharp contact with clay and chalk layers at the base of the Danian. No detailed and high-resolution biostratigraphy has been performed near the KTB in this section. The number of samples is 53 and the sampling interval varies from 5 to 10 cm.\nCaspian sea\nFig. 9 - Geographic location and a picture of the Iran section.

The sections are present at different stratigraphic positions, each related to a Deccan volcanism phase. The Daiwal River and Dhapewada sections were deposited during the phase-1, while the Anjar section concerns to the transition between the phase-1 and phase-2 (Fig. 10). The Podgawan section was exposed during the main Deccan phase, the phase-2, where the sediments exhibit the highest chemical alteration index values (Fantasia, 2013). The sediments consist mainly of massive or fissile clays, marls, siliceous to marly limestones and organic-rich rocks. The KTB remains to be determined.\n3.\tMethods\n3.1\tSample preparation\nIn the laboratory, rock powder has been prepared by crushing rock fragments in an agate mortar and subsequently put into cubic plastic boxes of 8 cm3 in volume (Fig. 11), with special cares to avoid any contaminations. Mass is measured for each cube with a precision of 10-3 g. After this procedure, the samples are ready to be measured in the laboratory apparatus.\nFig. 11 - The agate mortar used to prepare the rock powder and the samples prepared in plastic cubes of 8 cm3, ready for measurements.\n3.2\tMagnetic Susceptibility\nMagnetic susceptibility (MS) is a dimensionless quantity that reflects how easy a substance is magnetized when a magnetic field is applied. It is proportional to the concentration of ferromagnetic minerals, so that a sample with higher MS gets a higher magnetization when exposed to a certain magnetic field, as expressed by the equation (1), where J is the magnetization, X is the MS and H is the magnetic field.\nJ = !H\t(1)\n3.2.1\tMass specific Bulk Susceptibility\nThe MS was measured with a MFK1 Kappabridge (AGICO) apparatus in the laboratory. The field intensity was set to 200 A/m and the frequency was F1 (976 Hz). The measurements were made on bulk susceptibility mode, and the results are already referred to a constant volume, which is set to be 10 cm3 by the apparatus. As the cube boxes have a volume of 8 cm3, the results must be corrected using the equation (2). Kb is the bulk susceptibility, V0 is the nominal volume (the 10 cm3 used by the apparatus), V is the real volume of the sample and KT is the total susceptibility, the induced magnetic moment of the sample divided by the nominal volume. The final values presented during this dissertation are reported relative to mass specific m3/kg by dividing by density.\n(2)\n3.2.2\tFrequent dependent susceptibility (Kfd)\nFrequency-dependent susceptibility (Kfd) is a proxy used to evaluate the contribution of very fine (superparamagnetic) particles in a sample. The measurement is based on the fact that SP crystals lose their magnetization in a very short period of time, when the induced magnetic field is removed. A low frequency measurement allows the SP crystals behave as ferromagnetic mineral and contribute fully to the MS signal, whereas at high frequency the SP crystals are paramagnetic. So, it is expected that a sample without SP crystals have the same MS in the two frequencies, but a sample with SP crystals is expected to different MS values in function of the frequency. The Kfd is an index, expressed in percentage, calculated following the equation (3) proposed by Dearing (1994):\nLf -\nKfd =\tx 100\t(3)\n!f\nwhere Lf is the MS measured for low frequency and Hf is the MS for high frequency. A significant contribution of SP particles have Kfd > 10% (Table 1).\nFor the present study, MS was measured using the MFK1 kappabridge at the frequencies F1 (976 Hz) and F3 (15616 Hz). The measurement has been repeated three times each for each sample. In order to reduce measurement errors, a simple mean of the three values was considered for each frequency.\nTable 1- Interpretation on Kfd values (Dearing, 1994).\nKfd (%)\tInterpretation\n&lt;2.0\tVirtually no SP grains (<10%)\n2.0 - 10.0\tAdmixture of SP and coarser non-SP grains, or SP grains&lt;0.005 gm\n10.0 - 14.0\tVirtually all SP grains (>75%)\n> 14.0\tRare values, erroneous measurement, anisotropy, weak sample or contamination\n3.3\tIsothermal Remanent Magnetization (IRM)\nIsothermal Remanent Magnetization (IRM) is a magnetization acquired by a sample when submitted to an induced magnetic field, at constant temperature (usually the room's temperature). The magnetization depends on the magnetic mineralogy of the sample, as only the ferromagnetic mineral with coercivity less than the applied field are magnetized. The applied field intensity is gradually increased in the impulse magnetizer (IM-10-30) and the acquired magnetization measured at each step on a JR6 spinner magnetometer. Once plot on a graph H(mT) versus IRM(A/m), the IRM curve provide two important parameters: SIRM (magnetization saturation) and B1/2 (the field needed to induced half of the saturation; ~mean coercive force).\n3.3.1\tCumulative Log-Gaussian Functions\nRobertson and France (2004) showed that an IRM curve follow a normal Gaussian law and can be transformed into a Cumulative Log-Gaussian function (CLG). Later, Kruiver et al. (2001) developed a new method to analyse the IRM curves, based on the CLG function. The method consists in three curves fitting the IRM data versus the logarithm of the applied field: the first curve is the Linear Acquisition Plot (LAP), with the acquisition curve on a linear scale; the second is the Gradient Acquisition Plot (GAP), with the acquisition curve expressed as a gradient; and the third curve is the Standardised Acquisition Plot (SAP), with the acquisition curve on a probability scale. The IRM curve may be decomposed into a number of CLG curves, each curve referring to an individual ferromagnetic mineral (component) and characterized by three parameters: the saturation IRM (SIRM), B1/2 and dispersion parameter (DP). The total curve is the sum of all the individual curves (magnetic components).\nIn order to find the best fitting curve for the IRM data in the Kruiver et al. (2001) software, we need to identify the number of components and their values of SIRM, log B1/2 and DP by tentative to error. The advantage of the method is that, in addition to SIRM and B1/2 parameters, we obtain a third parameter, the DP parameter, that is the dispersion parameter, so lower values of DP reveal more homogeneous coercivity assemblages.\n3.3.2 S-ratio\nS =\t-1\n^classic\ti\nb\nS\t=a\nBloemendal 7\nb\n(4)\n(5)\nThe S-ratio is a rock magnetic parameter that measures the relative contribution of low and high coercive minerals within a sample. Thompson et al. (1986) proposed the classical S-ratio formula, expressed in equation (4), where a is the IRM for a positive field of 0,3T (because magnetite grains should be saturated by fields of 300 mT) and b is the IRM for a positive strong field of 1 T (most of the cases, it can be considered SIRM). The values of the classic S-ratio vary from -1 (high coercive minerals) to 1 (low coercive minerals). Analyzing the extreme cases, if the S-ratio is 1, a is equal to b, so the magnetization at a 0,3 and 1T of the sample is the same. It means that the sample is completely saturated at 300 mT, indicating it is constituted by low coercive minerals. On the contrary, if the S-ratio is -1, the sample has only acquired magnetization for fields stronger than 0,3 T, meaning that the sample is constituted by high coercive minerals.\nBloemendal et al. (1992) redefined the S-ratio (called S'-ratio) as the ratio of the IRM for a positive field at 300 mT by the IRM for a positive field at 1 T (5). In this case, the S-ratio varies from 0, when the sample has no magnetization after being exposed to a 300 mT field (high coercive minerals), to 1, when the magnetization is the same for a 300 mT and a 1 T field (low coercive minerals). Kruiver et al. (2001) considered the Bloemendal S-ratio definition more logical, so in this work all the S-ratio were calculated on this form.\n3.1\tThermomagnetic curves\nThermomagnetic curves are used to identify the ferromagnetic minerals present in a sample through its Curie temperature (the temperature at which a ferromagnetic mineral loses its magnetic properties and turns paramagnetic). The Curie temperature (Tc) of several minerals is well tabulated, so its determination on a thermomagnetic curve may help us identifying the ferromagnetic minerals. The thermomagnetic curves are done at high (HT) and low temperatures (LT). The HT curves consists in measuring the magnetic susceptibility while the sample is being warmed until 700\u00b0C and then while it is cooling until reaches the room temperature again. The measures are performed on a CS4 furnace in an Argon controlled atmosphere, to avoid sample's oxidation during warming phase. For LT measurements samples are cooled to -192\u00b0C using liquid nitrogen on a CS-L cryostat apparatus. The magnetic susceptibility is measured while the sample is warming up until it reaches the room's temperature again. The MS is measured with a MFK1 Kappabridge (AGICO) and the data is treated by Cureval 8.0 (AGICO) software.\n3.2\tDiffuse Reflectance Spectrophotometry (DRS)\nThe color of the rock is essentially controlled by their mineralogy and notably by the composition of the iron oxides present in the sediment. For example, small amount of pigmentary hematite are needed to give a red color to a sediment. Therefore, coupling color data to magnetic properties is a new approach to characterize the magnetic mineralogy of a sample (Ellwood et al, 2003).\nDiffuse Reflectance Spectrophotometry, also called color, is a rapid and non-destructive technique based on the reflection spectrum of the sample. The samples need to be carefully prepared, smashed until they are transformed into a very fine powder and then packed into a sample holder with a circular hole to form a smooth surface without irregularities (Fig. 12). A beam of incident light is pointed to the prepared sample and diffuse reflectance spectrum data from 390 to 700 nm (with intervals of 10 nm) is stored in a convenient file format on the computer. The spectrum data can be converted into a color by using the Munsell color system, a three dimensional coordinates (L* a* b*) following the Comission International de l\u2019Eclairage (CIE, 1976). The L* axis represents \u201clightness-darkness\u201d, the a* axis \u201credness-greeness\u201d and the b* axis \u201cyellowness-blueness\u201d. Each iron oxide exhibits a color that is mainly a function of the electron transitions allowed by its structure, so that the spectrum data may help identifying the iron oxides present in our samples. Furthermore, in this work is used the CIE values and how it varies over a sedimentary section, in order to evaluate if there is a relation between the color and the magnetic properties. The data were obtained using a X-Rite Colortron spectrophotometer from 86 rock powders, in order to avoid grain size effects. All the samples were measured three times and the mean value was considered.\n3.2.1\tThe first derivative of reflectance spectra\nThe first derivative of the reflectance data may be used to identify iron oxides in sediments. Previous studies have shown that two common iron oxides, hematite and goethite have distinct first derivative peaks, centered at 565 and 435 nm, respectively (Deaton and Balsam, 1991). The first derivative was calculated and represented with a MATLAB program. The program read the notepad files with the spectrum data and automatically calculates and represents the graphs of the first derivative of all samples present in the file at one time. A finite differences method should be enough to have a good approximation on the first derivative curve, but I decided to program a five-point method (Equation 5), which is more accurate. R is the reflectance, X is the wave length (nm) and h is the spacing interval (in nm).\nR'(!)\nR(! - 2h) - 8R(! - h) + 8R(! + h) - R(! + 2h)\n12h\n(6)\nI I >.\nOE uBO\nA\n\u2014\nFig. 12 - The preparation of the\ni 1\nsamples and the measurement of DRS with the spectrophotometer.\n4.\tMarine sections\n4.1\tResults\n4.1.1\tBidart\n[i.e. magnetite)\nMagnetite + Akaganeite\nMagnetite + Akaganeite\nJ\nSIRM/Mass (A/m/g) comp. 2\nFig. 13 - High resolution magnetic data at the Bidart section (France), with Mass specific MS, magnetic parameters obtained by CLG treatment and IRM curves (modified from Font et al., 2013).\n\u25a0 comp. 2 (akaganeite?)\nSIRM contribution (%) comp. 1/\u2014comp. 2\n\nThe high-resolution magnetic study at Bidart (Fig. 13) confirmed the low MS interval described by Font et al. (2011). This low MS interval is right below the KTB and is accompanied by a notable decrease in S-ratio from values next to 1 to values next to 0, indicative of the dominance of a highly coercive component, which is probably akaganeite (referred as component 2). The component 1 is of a low to medium coercivity and probably corresponds to detrital magnetite observed under SEM microscope (Font et al., 2011).\nIn addition to the previous results of Font et al. (2011) we show here that the low MS interval actually corresponds to a loss in detrital magnetite (component 1) as shown by the strong decrease in SIRM/mass values (Fig. 13). The Log B 1/2 profile also detects the presence of the component 2 with a high coercivity in the low MS interval.\nThe IRM acquisition curves were separated by intervals in Fig. 13. In the Dark clay layer interval, above the KTB, the IRM curve is magnetite type, with the samples being totally saturated at low magnetic fields (less than 300 mT). At the top of the low MS interval, the curves are still highly magnetized at low fields, but some of them start to don\u2019t reach the saturation, suggesting a mixture of magnetite and the high coercive mineral (akaganeite). In the middle of the low MS interval, the samples are very resistant to magnetization, indicative of a high coercive phase. In the base of low MS interval the high coercive phase gradually disappears, giving place to a magnetite typical curve in the Maastrichtian marls again.\nStatistic Acquisition Plot\nLinear Acquisition Plot\n0.08\nLow MS interval\nPKB2B2 (-33cm)\nLog B1/2(mT)\n1.6\nN\n0.6\nD\u00cd\nLog B1/2(mT)\nE\n<\n0.04\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1 -2 -3\nC a>\nra\n0\nPK8.A2\n(-74cm)\nMaastritchian\nMarls J\nc a>\n\"O 0.04\nCv\no\n1\t1.5\t2\t2.5\t3\nLog B1/2(mT)\no i \u2014.............................\n0.5\t1\t1.5\t2\t2.5\t3\t3.5\nLog B1/2(mT)\n1\t1.5\t2\t2.5\t3\t3.5\nLog B1/2(mT)\n0-1 ...................\u00b0, ,\u00b0.............\n0.5\t1\t1.5\t2\t2.5\t3\t3.5\nLog B1/2(mT)\nGradient Acquisition Plot\n0.08j\nFig. 14 - CLG treatment of two samples from Bidart, one in the low MS interval to emphasize the coercive mineral and other in the Maastrichtian Marls.\nIn the Fig. 14 two examples of CLG treatment (Kruiver et al., 2001), one in the low MS interval (PKB2B2) and the second in the Maastrichtian marls (PK8A2), are shown. The high coercive phase is visible in the sample PKB2B2, as the LAP is far from saturation and in GAP a phase with a Log Bi/2 with values near 2.5 is well identified. The magnetite phase is also identified in this sample (Log B1/2 around 1.5), but in a very minor contribution. The sample PK8A2 is already saturated at lower magnetic fields as shown in LAP and the GAP evidence the presence of two low coercivity phases, with Log B1/2 values less than 2.\nThe high coercive phase detected in the CLG treatment is explained by the presence of akaganeite as it is an anti-ferromagnetic mineral. This type of ferromagnetic minerals have anti-parallel spins and creates a strong autodemagnetizing internal field, so that a very strong field is necessary to orientate the spins to the same direction.\n4.1.2\tBasque Country\nThe Basque Country studied sections don\u2019t show conclusive results (Fig. 15). The MS in Sopelana is quite constant along the profile, with exception for a high peak near 120 cm. In the DRS data there is nothing to enhance. The Uruxa section results don\u2019t add much to the discussion as well. Just as Sopelana, there is no evidence of a low MS interval under the KTB. The DRS data evidence a color transition about 20 cm under the KTB, tending to a \u201credness\u201d pattern.\nSopelana\nVisible DRS\nBlack\nGreen\nWhite\nUruxa\tVisible DRS\nFig. 15 - Magnetic and DRS data of the Basque Country sections (Sopelana and Uruxa).\n0\t0,002 0,004 0,006 0,008\t-2\t3\t8\t13\t18\nMass Specific Magnetic Susceptibility (10_6m3/kg)\tBlue\t\tYellow\n4.1.3 Gubbio\n\u00cd\nVisible DRS\nFig. 16 - Magnetic and DRS data of the Gubbio section.\nMass Specific Magnetic\nSusceptibility (10 6m3/kg)\nMass Specific Magnetic\nSusceptibility (10'6m3/kg)\n\nJ\nH (mT)\tH (mT)\tH (mT)\nFig. 17 - Comparison between IRM normalized curves from Gubbio at different intervals.\nThe Fig. 16 describes the magnetic data from the Gubbio (Italy) section. It is observed an abrupt change on magnetic properties in the KTB. A low MS interval is found bellow this limit and it is followed by a general decrease in the SIRM of all components. A third coarser component appears in this interval, and the relative contribution of the components change, with the component 2 becoming the major contributor. The S-ratio also starts to decrease bellow the KTB, reflecting the presence of a greater amount of higher coercivity phases. IRM curves (Fig. 17) agree with the presence of a coarser mineral in all section, but in higher concentration in the low MS interval or below, as they don\u2019t reach saturation at lower fields. At least one of the coarser mineral detected in IRM is hematite, as the thermomagnetic curves show a Tc near 680\u00b0C (Fig. 18).\nAccording to DRS data, in the low MS interval the samples present a less \u201credness\u201d and \u201cyellowness\u201d color, and also a less \u201cdarkness\u201d. This agrees with the log description of the sedimentary section, which shows that this low MS interval is constituted by white limestone. The reflectance spectra\u2019s first derivative graphics show two distinct peaks in most of the samples, as illustrated in Fig. 19. These peaks are positioned precisely in the typical wavelengths for Goethite and Hematite (Deaton and Balsam, 1991). However, goethite is not identified in the thermomagnetic curves (Tc=120\u00b0C). Torrent and Barron (2002) pointed that this method may fail to identify akaganeite and other iron oxides because of similar colors and high color variability, what can explain the difficulty using the method.\nFig. 19 -First derivative of the reflectance spectrum data in order to the wave length, for the sample GU45.\n4.1.4\tIran\nThe DRS data from Iran don't show significant trends in the L*, a* and b* curves, except at the chalk levels where an abrupt shifts in the color are observed (Fig. 20). The abrupt shift in the MS value at 140 m is interpreted to correspond to the KTB as it was already observed in other sections worldwide. Note that the exact position of the KTB in the Galanderud section was not yet defined before our study. Our magnetic results provide for the first time the position of the KTB in Iran and well corroborate recent biostratigraphic data (Asgharianrostami et al., 2013). If we assume a correct position for the KTB we do not observe here the typical low MS interval such as in Bidart and Gubbio. The explanation would be that the section is not complete stratigraphicaly or simply because it does not exist in this part of the globe.\nGreen\nRed\nBlack\nVisible DRS\n100\n200\n180\n160\nKTB\n140\n120\n100\nCIE a\nCIE b\nCIE L\nMass Specific Magnetic\nSusceptibility (10'6m3/kg)\n30\nYellow\nWhite\n|l * I * | Limestone E3 Clays\nFig. 20 - Magnetic and DRS data of the Iran section.\n4.2\tDiscussion\nThe Bidart magnetic high-resolution study confirmed the results of Font et al., (2011). The low MS interval is positioned immediately under the KTB and IRM analysis confirmed the presence of the high coercive mineral akaganeite. Its presence was also confirmed by SEM (Fig. 5) and is accompanied by a magnetite loss. These new data are now published in Font et al. (2013). Font et al. (2013) proposed a model for the formation of akaganeite in volcanic events, and for its transport through the stratosphere in order to explain the presence of akaganeite thousands of kilometers away from the Deccan province at the time of the eruptions.\nThe model of akaganeite formation and transport (Fig. 21) starts with the convection generated by the strong heating due to the widespread lava flows. According to Kaminski et al. (2011) this heating is enough to create a buoyancy force capable of transporting the volcanic plume to the high atmosphere and even stratosphere. When the volcanic plume, rich in FeCl2, reaches the high atmosphere, a reaction with water and oxygen occurs to form akaganeite. The volcanic aerosols and akaganeite are then transported through the stratosphere, where it can circle the globe in two weeks (Robock, 2000). Therefore, it is possible that the akaganeite could be deposited thousands of kilometers away from Deccan.\nThe model also explains the loss in detrital magnetite as we demonstrated here by the abrupt decrease of SIRM values (Fig. 13). The hypothesis is based on the effect of acid rains as a consequence of the huge Deccan volcanic gas emissions. The normal rain has a pH of 5.6, but the volcanic rains may have a pH of 3 to 4.5 (Calabrese et al, 2011). As the magnetite can be totally dissolved with a pH<4 (White et al., 1994), the volcanic origin acid rains explains the magnetite loss.\nStratospheric volcanic plume (Aerosol lifetime=l-3 years)\nz\t\\\nO 2Fe2+(aq) + Cl'(aq) + 3/2H2O\n+ 3/4O2(g) = p-Fe2(OH)3Cl(s)\nAkaganeite\nmore reflected solar flux\nTropopause (9-16 km)\nabsorption^\u00ae \\\u2014\nH2S \u00ab\t\u2022 *\nSQ\to NET HEATING Stratosphere\nTroposphere\nHeated mixed layer\nH2SO4\nFeCl2(s)\n\u25b2\nNET COOLING\n(higher 5laO values)\nAcid rains 4 A A\n(PH~4) 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4\n6 A A 6\n6\nMagnetite dissolution\nGubbio\nDeccan Phase 2\n(106 km3 of lavas)\nFig. 21 - Conceptual model of the sedimentary marine record of continental magnetite dissolution caused by volcanic acidic rains (Font et al. 2013).\nThe Gubbio section also presents a low MS interval, although it is not as clear as in Bidart. The presence of akaganeite was confirmed by SEM observations (Fig. 5), but contrary to Bidart its identification by using IRM analyses is more complicated. This is because in Bidart there is no dominance of hematite in the Maastrichtian marls, whereas in Italy it is the main magnetic carrier. Note that hematite and akaganeite are both antiferromagnetic and thus cannot be discriminated by their coercivity on IRM curves. However, in Gubbio, one to two high coercive component is observed in the profile, even in the low MS interval composed by white limestones. However, as few pigment of hematite are needed to give a red color to a sediment, it means that the high coercive phase identified in the low MS interval of Gubbio cannot be hematite. By elimination we suggest that this high coercive phase correspond to the akaganeite identified under SEM by Font et al. (2011).\nLowrie et al. (1990) interpreted this change in color due to reducing conditions (that transform FeIII into FeII) during post-depositional processes, such as the percolation of reducing fluids due to high levels of organic matter probably originated from the KT mass extinction. However, the white beds are 50 cm thick and it is very difficult for fluids to penetrate limestones downward. Secondly, if reducing conditions were prevalent there we should only form reduced iron and thus magnetite. But this is not the case, since antiferromagnetic phase is still present in this interval. We thus conclude that akaganeite probably correspond to the high coercive phase identified in the low MS interval and that the acid rain model proposed by Font et al. (2013) at Bidart may also be applicable to the Gubbio\nsection. The identified hematite in the thermomagnetic curves in the white limestones interval may be a product of akaganeite transformation during the heating of the sample. Yue et al. (2011) affirms the akaganeite can be converted to hematite when exposed to higher temperatures than 300\u00b0C.\nThe other KT sections (Iran and Basque Country) don\u2019t add much to the discussion. The low MS interval is not present. These results are probably due to the tectonic deformation and/or chemical alteration.\n5.\tContinental sections (India)\n5.1\tResults\n5.1.1\tAnjar\n| I Limestone |_\t| Marls\nI I Clays\t|~\u25a1 Basalts\nKFD (%)\tLogB1/2(mT)\tGreen\tRed Visible DRS\nFig. 22 - Magnetic and DRS data of the inter-trappean sediments in Anjar, India.\nThe magnetic and DRS data of Anjar (Fig. 22) don\u2019t show much variety through the sedimentary column. The MS profile follows the facie changes, with lower values in limestone samples and higher values in clay/marl samples. The IRM analysis identified two components. The first component is probably magnetite, with a low coercivity (Log B1/2 close to 1.6). The second component has a high coercivity (Log B1/2 close to 2.5) but its contribution is low (between 15-20%), and it is probably hematite, as the thermomagnetic curve of the sample ANJ-27 (at the distance 349 cm in the log) shows a Tc=680\u00b0C (Fig. 23). The IRM curves and coercivity parameters don\u2019t change considerably through the profile, so we may conclude that similar magnetic mineralogy is shared by all the samples. The Kfd values are almost constant through the profile, indicating a mixture of SP grains and coarser non-SP grains (2<Kfd<10, Table 1).\nA) Podgavan\nKm (10 8SI/g)\n151 V\nB) Anjar\nKm (10'SI/g)\nPoA7 (calcrete)\nTemperature (\u00b0C)\nKm\nTemperature (\u00b0C)\nC) Dhapewada\nAnj27\n(carbonate)\n0 1................\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0..................\n0\t100\t200\t300\t400\t500\t600\t700\nTemperature (\u00b0C)\nPoB9 (clays)\n-> DhaplO\n(day)\n100\t200\t300\t400\t500\t600\t700\nTemperature (\u00b0C)\nKm (10\u201dSI/g)\n14 1 \\\nPoA14\n(coal)\no I...............................\n0\t100\t200\t300\t400\t500\nTemperature (\u00b0C)\nD) Daiwal river\n(10'Sl/g)\nDAI (Basalt)\n100\t200\t300\t400\t500\t600\t700\nTemperature (\u00b0C)\n<-------\nP0AI6 (red clays)\n200\t300\t400\t500\t600\t700\nTemperature (\u00b0C)\nKm (10 \u2019Sl/g)\n5 1\n<-\n4:\nDA10 (diatomite)\nFig. 23 - Thermomagnetic curves of inter-trappean sediments in India.\nTemperature (\u00b0C)\n5.1.2 Dhapewada\nFig. 24 - Magnetic and DRS data of the inter-trappean sediments in Dhapewada, India.\nIn the Dhapewada magnetic data (Fig. 24) stands the sample Dhap-10 and the Dhap-15, at the distance of 85 and 132 cm, respectively. Both samples (with emphasis to Dhap-10) present a peak of higher MS in comparison with the nearest samples and the two mineralogic components have low coercivity values (Log B1/2 less than 1.5 in both components). By the contrary, the other samples have a component 2 with higher coercivity (Log B1/2 higher than 2). The thermomagnetic curve (Fig. 23) of Dhap-10 shows the presence of two minerals, which are magnetite (Tc=580\u00b0C) and probably maghemite. Maghemite has a Tc=645\u00b0C (Dunlop and Ozdemir, 1997), but is thermally unstable and can be destroyed at temperatures higher than 300\u00b0C. In the cooling curve, the transition between 300350\u00b0C observed in the heating curve isn\u2019t present, so we assume the maghemite was destroyed. Also note that maghemite has low coercivity values, what agrees with the IRM data. The magnetite could be a product of the maghemite transformation in the heating process, but in this case it is an original mineral because it had been identified in the IRM curves.\nThe Fig. 25 compares the IRM curves and CLG treatment of Dhap-10 and Dhap-16. In the LAP curves it is visible that Dhap-10 saturates at lower fields what corroborates the two very low coercivity phases identified in the GAP curve. On the other side, Dhap-16 has a second component with a higher coercivity, with a low contribution, but sufficient to do not saturate in the applied fields.\nThe DRS data doesn\u2019t show much variation through the section. The sample Dhap-10, which has the highest MS value, presents a more \u201credness\u201d and dark color. The Kfd values follow the MS profile, but only the samples 3, 4 and 10 may have a small quantity of SP grains (Kfd<2).\nFig. 25 - CLG treatment of two IRM curves from Dhapewada.\n5.1.3\tDaiwal River\nSusceptibility (10\u20196 m3/kg)\nk\nFig. 26 - Magnetic and DRS data of the inter-trappean sediments in Daiwal River, India.\nd\t\t\n\tI\t\n1\t340\t\n\t320\t\n\t230\t\n\t200\t\n\t,40\t\n\t30\tJl v\tV \\\n\t\tv vyv 1\nCL\t40\t\n\t\t\nConcerning the Daiwal River section, it is noted that a third component with very high coercivity is present in some samples. However, its concentration is low, with exception of a particular sample, the DA-3. This sample is from a sediment deposition in a basalt fissure, and has the highest MS in the profile. But the major particularity is that the contribution of the component 3 is higher than the other components. It is reflected on the S-ratio value, with a notable decrease to values below 0.5. The Fig. 27 shows the IRM and CLG treatment for this sample, where it is evident the presence of a very high coercivity phase, resulting in an IRM curve far from saturation.\nThe MS profile doesn't show abrupt variations through the section, with the values becoming higher as they approach the basalts. The DRS data is almost constant along the profile, with exception to the basalt samples, which present a darker pattern as expected. The samples don't have SP grains (Kfd<2) or have a mixture of SP and non-SP grains (2<Kfd<10).\n5.1.4\tPodgawan\nOstracod\nUndulating\nPoA3b)\nWhite\nGreen Blue\n35\t45\nRed Yellow\nVisible DRS\nLog B1/2 (mT)\nKFD (%)\nComp. 1\nComp. 2\nComp. 3\nComp. 4\nComp. 5\nSIRM / Mass (A/m/g)\nMass Specific Magnetic\nSusceptibility (10_6 m3/kg)\n|i 1 I 1 | Limestone\nCalcrete\nE3 Clays\t[_\t| Laminated shales\tGastropods\nSilty Clays\tBasalts\nFig. 28 - Magnetic and DRS data of the inter-trappean sediments in Podgawan, India.\nThe Podgawan section results show a very distinct magnetic mineralogy in comparison with the other sections. The IRM analysis (with the help of CLG functions) identified at least three mineralogic components, reaching four and even five components in some samples. Their coercivity is not very high, as few components identified in this section surpasses a log B1/2 of 2.5, and the highest coercivity minerals have a very low content. Therefore, the S-ratio values are always very high, near 1. The Fig. 29 presents the CLG treatment to three different samples along the section. POA-14 (coal level) can be adjusted considering three components, but POB-3 and POB-9 still needs more components to achieve a good adjustment. The components are probably different phases of magnetite, with a very large distribution of grain sizes (heterogeneous distribution). The thermomagnetic curve of POA-14 shows a magnetite composition, but the POB-9 and POA-16 (red clay) identifies some hematite, along with the magnetite.\nThe MS profile follows the facie changes (higher values on clays and lower on limestones), except a peak of high MS on a red clay level, accompanied by higher SIRM values. It is precisely in this level that the sediments are constituted by SP grains (Kfd>10), what is indicative of alteration. About the DRS data, it shows some abrupt changes in color through the profile.\nr\nA\nk\nFig. 29 - CLG treatment of IRM curves obtained from Podgawan.\ny\n5.2\tDiscussion\nThe results obtained from the magnetic analysis at the Podgawan section were by far the most interesting. The Podgawan sediments were deposited during the phase-2 of the Deccan volcanism, characterized by stressful environmental conditions and a global warming due to the great amount of CO2 input in the atmosphere and acid rains. In fact, our results in Podgawan show an unusual number of low to medium magnetic components, which we interpret as various populations of magnetite (identified through their Curie temperature, Fig. 23) with various amount of Titanium and a large distribution of grain size. We suggest that such heterogeneity result from severe weathering and stressed paleo-environmental conditions during the Deccan phase-2. Ghosh et al. (2006) and Srivastava et al. (2012) analyzed the inter-basaltic bole beds in the Deccan LIP and confirmed that weathering processes were intense during the Deccan volcanism.\nAlicia Fantasia (2013) performed a great variety of geological and geochemical measurements in the same samples and provided similar results. Very negative values of S13C are indicative of the high concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, which was unequivocally due to volcanic input (Fig. 30).\nAlso they evaluated the chemical index of alteration (CIA) of the samples and noted that the Podgawan section had the highest values of CIA (Fig. 31). We thus propose that the number of components is proportional to the deterioration degree of the sample and is indicative of the severe paleoclimatic conditions during its deposition.\nAnother important result from the Podgawan section concerns samples POA-14 (coal level) and POA-16 (red clay), separated by just 13 cm. The POA-14 is composed mostly by magnetite. Although a coarser component (hematite/goethite?) is observed in the IRM curve, its contribution is very low and not depicted in the thermomagnetic curve (Fig. 23). However, the POA-16 presents completely different characteristics: the color (red) and the composition (hematite, identified both in IRM and thermomagnetic curve). Considering their proximity in the sedimentary column, an abrupt change in environmental conditions must had occurred. The Chicxulub impact is supposed to generate a thermal radiation capable of burning forests all around the globe (Belcher et al., 2003). The burned material that resulted from this phenomena may be the origin of the coal level present in POA-14. Subsequently, the posterior deposition would occur in an arid environment, more favourable to oxidation, what explains the red color, and the presence of hematite in POA-16. Presence of organic matter in POA-14 should have created reducing conditions, where only magnetite and iron sulphur remain stable, giving an explanation for the dominance of magnetite in our magnetic data. On the other hand, hematite is only formed via oxidation of iron precursors and thus its dominance in sample POA-16 suggest arid and oxidizing conditions. In Fig. 32 we can detect the hematite (Fe and O peaks in the spectrum) in the form of small spherules, which we interpret as the result of the matrix oxidation. This may be due to the absence of the vegetal cover after the wildfire that favours contact with oxygen and transforms magnetite to hematite.\nThis hypothesis has important implication for the problematic of the KT mass extinction, because we may be able now to locate precisely the position (age) of the meteorite impact and of the Deccan Phase-2 and their link with the mass extinction. Keller et al. (2009) positioned the KTB (and the mass extinction) in the Jhilmili inter-trappean sediments, using biostratigraphy analysis. Figure 33 shows that the Jhilmili sediments were deposited at the end of the Deccan Phase 2, just after the Podgawan sediments. Since the impact is marked on the Podgawan section by the coal level, we suggest that the mass extinction occurred after the impact, as Keller et al. (2003) had already defended.\nFig. 30 - Profile of 613C in the Podgawan section (Alicia Fantasia, 2013).\nDongargaon\tp-i Trapp \u00a1nferieurl\tDaiwal\tTS Governmental ti\tPodgawan\tU Titjlafra ti\tUmaria-lsra\nDinosaures et Megaflora\tRecuperation\n1\tPalynomorphes et Megaflora\nChampignons et M.O biodegradee\nFig. 32 - SEM images of the sample POA-16 (Image courtesy of Eric Font).\n6.\tConclusions\nThe main conclusions of this work are:\n\u2022\tGubbio has similar results to Bidart: i) the low MS interval is present and corresponds to the loss of detrital magnetite and hematite, explaining the disappearance of the red color in this interval. ii) the presence of another very coercive phase that does not correspond to hematite and we interpret as being the akaganeite previously described in literature.\n\u2022\tData from Sopelana and Uruxa was not conclusive, probably due to strong deformation that affected the area after Cretaceous.\n\u2022\tIn Iran, an abrupt transition in MS data was identified and is interpreted as the KTB according to published biostratigraphy data.\n\u2022\tThe Podgawan magnetic data supports the evidence of very high weathering during the phase-2 of Deccan volcanism, due to the presence of several (4 to 5) magnetic components.\n\u2022\tIn addition, a peculiar interval of black (organic matter) and red (hematite) thin sedimentary levels is interpreted as the result of wildfire due to the Chicxulub impact. These data demonstrate for the first time that the Chixculub impact occurred during Deccan phase 2. Moreover, considering that the KTB has been found at the Jhilmili sediments and the Podgawan section is older in age, it's possible that the impact occurred before the KTB.\n\u2022\tThese results provide new insight to check for the contribution of Deccan volcanism and Chicxulub impact in the KT mass extinction.\n7.\tAcknowledgements\nI'm grateful to Prof. Eric Font for advice and by monitoring my work.
