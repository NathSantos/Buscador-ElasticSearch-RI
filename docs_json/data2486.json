waters (blue) come into the system crossing the Makassar strait, \ntransporting about 80% of all ITF volume. Intermediate waters, below the thermocline, carry South Pacific waters \n(red) into the archipelago\u2019s circulation crossing the Lifamatola Passage. Waters flowing through Timor, Ombai \nand Lombok straits represent almost all the volume exported from the ITF system into the Indian Ocean. Values \nindicate the annual mean volume transport, in Sverdrups (1 Sv = 106 m3/s), across the main straits for the inflow \nand the outflow (adapted from Gordon and Fine, 1996). ..................................................................................... 14 \n\nFIGURE 1.2 | Stratification in the Indonesian Seas: samples of waters from different positions labeled as \u201ci, ii, \niii, \u2026 , x\u201d, are shown in the graph and are associated to their own local T-S diagram, representing the temperature \nin the vertical axis and salinity in the horizontal one.

The big hiatus of the mid 20th century is showed to be \nfinished by 1972, and the most recent hiatus should be considered from 2001, to avoid influences due to the \n1997/98 El Ni\u00f1o and the 1999/2000 La Ni\u00f1a events. The last volcanic eruptions of El Chich\u00f3n (1982) and \nPinatubo (1991) are highlighted to show their short-term influence on the surface temperature drop.

The graphic shows the names of sections used \nto estimate the transports. Karimata, Makassar and Moluccas correspond to the inflow pathway; and Timor, \nOmbai, Flores and Lombok to the outflow one. .................................................................................................... 43 \n\nFIGURE 3.2 | Horizontal Map of the flow in the mixed layer considering the average velocity field for the ten \nlast years of the Climatological Run. Makassar Passage is shown as the major inflow passageway for superficial \nflows. In this layer, water coming from Pacific are transported within Flores Sea toward Banda Sea, exiting from \nIndonesian archipelago to Indian Ocean basin by travelling throughout Lombok, Flores, Ombai and Timor straits. \nA smaller intense flow can be observed entering the Indonesian seas by inflowing through Karimata strait. ..... 43 \n\nFIGURE 3.3 | Horizontal Map of flow at 1000 m depth considering the average velocity field in the last ten \nyears of the Climatological Run. The Lifamatola passage is the only pathway for the inflow of deep water from \nPacific Ocean into the Indonesian seas. A southward deep flow is formed in Banda Sea and its trajectory follows \nis affected by topographic boundaries which exist in the sea due to presence of small islands. Lastly, these deep \nwaters exit from the Indonesian archipelago toward the Indian Ocean by outflowing through Ombai strait and \nTimor passage. The graph also marks the 200 m (wider light blue line) and 1000 m (white) bathymetries. The \ngrey area is shallower than 1000 m. ....................................................................................................................... 44 \n\nFIGURE 3.4 | Vertical Structure of major inflow passageway of ITF: Makassar strait (left) and Lifamatola \npassage (right). Current speed across the strait (meridional component) are showed in the graphs on top and \nSalinity and Potential Temperature stratification on bottom. Blue color intensities indicate a southward flow, \nwhile red ones denote a northward flow. In Makassar there is a continuous flux with two cores (above and below \nthe thermocline) and it is not deeper than 800 m. In Lifamatola, HYCOM is representing an alternating direct \nflux, where the deep flux presents a core ?1100 m depth. The stratification patterns show Lifamatola \nsubthermocline waters slightly more saline than ones in Makassar. This suggests origins in North Pacific for waters \nwithin Makassar and South Pacific for Lifamatola deep flow. .............................................................................. 46 \n\nFIGURE 3.5 | Vertical structure of Ombai strait (left) and Timor passage (right) showing the flow across the \nstraits (top) and the stratification profile (bottom).  Blue intensities denote westward velocities and red ones \nmeans eastward velocities crossing the section. In both straits, the flow presents two cores, one above and other \nbelow thermocline, transporting waters which previously passed through Makassar and Lifamatola, respectively.\n ................................................................................................................................................................................ 48 \nFIGURE 3.6 | Maps of the upper 700 m depth-integrated transport. Values are shown for each single grid \npoint, where blue colors denote lower values of transport and red higher. Units are given in 10-9 Sv/m2 (in a 0.08\u00b0 \nhorizontal grid). Arrows represent the wind field. Name of the months are abbreviated in the bottom right corner \nof each map. The change in wind direction along the year is due to a monsoon pattern that drives winds in the \nITF region. As it can be seen in the Figure, this drives seasonal variability of the ITF transports, and consequently \nin the amount of waters exchange from Pacific to the Indian Ocean. ................................................................... 51 \n\nFIGURE 3.7 | Inflow (red) and outflow (black) volume transport in the upper 700 m depth for the \nClimatological Run. The envelopes represent standard errors based on the definition of each curve as being the \nsum of transports in individual straits. Negative values indicate transports southward or westward. Dashed lines \nare the mean annual value for inflow (red) and outflow (black).  Superficial ITF transports presents a high seasonal \nvariability that is driven mostly by the monsoon winds pattern, in a reverse mode increase/decrease for \ninflow/outflow along the year. ............................................................................................................................... 52 \n\n\n\nFIGURE 3.8 | The ITF\u2019s outflow volume transport in the upper 700 m from 1970 to 2015.

In its superficial branch, warm \nwaters are exchanged throughout the world\u2019s ocean basins. The Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) and the Agulhas \nLeakage (AL) are the main processes responsible, respectively, for importing Pacific Ocean waters into the Indian \nOcean, and for exporting Indian Ocean waters into the Atlantic Ocean. Recently, changes in both systems have \nbeen reported and can be related to global warming consequences, processes of air-sea interactions and variabilities \nin the ocean circulation and wind patterns. In the present work, output of a high-resolution, global implementation \nof HYCOM (Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model) from different runs were used, aiming at a study of the structure \nand variability of the ITF, and to evaluate the use of a numerical tool for tracking virtual Lagrangian particles to \ncorrelate circulation patterns of the ITF and the AL. For the ITF, analysis of the models\u2019 output provided a mean \nvolume transport in the upper 700 m depth of about 13 Sv, what is in the range of values reported by observations \nand other numerical simulations in the region. The seasonal variability was found to be related to the monsoons \nwind regimes, and the ITF\u2019s response to the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was evaluated. During five La \nNi\u00f1a events, the mean volume transport was of approximately 16 Sv, and for also five El Ni\u00f1o events, of \napproximately 12 Sv. Results show an abrupt increase in the heat transport between 2002 and 2012, what could \nbe related to changes in the heat content within the Indian Ocean for the same period. Heat transport anomalies \nwere analyzed in the last years of the time series and present a clear correlation with Nino3.4 index, denoting a \nstrong response of the ITF to the 2014/16 El Ni\u00f1o. Numerical test-experiments simulating Lagrangian particles \nhave been performed, to identify and quantify water masses\u2019 origins compounding the ITF and to correlate \nvariabilities signals of ITF in the Indian Ocean\u2019s basin circulation and in the Agulhas Leakage.  \n\n \n\nKeywords: Indonesian Throughflow; Agulhas Leakage; ENSO; Lagrangian tracers \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRESUMO \n\nA Circula\u00e7\u00e3o de Revolvimento Meridional do oceano desempenha um papel importante no sistema clim\u00e1tico da \nTerra, atrav\u00e9s da redistribui\u00e7\u00e3o do excesso de calor ganho pelo planeta em baixas latitudes.

Recentemente, mudan\u00e7as em ambos sistemas \nt\u00eam sido reportados e podem estar relacionados a consequ\u00eancias do aquecimento global, a processos de intera\u00e7\u00e3o \nar-mar e a variabilidades da circula\u00e7\u00e3o oce\u00e2nica e de padr\u00f5es de vento. No presente trabalho foram usadas sa\u00eddas \nde diferentes rodadas usando uma implementa\u00e7\u00e3o global em alta resolu\u00e7\u00e3o do HYCOM (Hybrid Coordinate Ocean \nModel), com o objetivo de estudar a estrutura e variabilidade do ITF e avaliar o uso de uma ferramenta num\u00e9rica \npara rastrear virtualmente a trajet\u00f3ria de part\u00edculas Lagrangianas e correlacionar padr\u00f5es de circula\u00e7\u00e3o do ITF e \ndo VA. Para o ITF, an\u00e1lises dos resultados dos modelos forneceram um valor de transporte de volume de ?13 Sv \npara os primeiros 700 m de profundidade, o qual est\u00e1 em acordo com valores obtidos por observa\u00e7\u00f5es e outras \nsimula\u00e7\u00f5es num\u00e9ricas. A variabilidade sazonal foi demonstrada estar relacionada aos regimes de vento de mon\u00e7\u00f5es, \ne a resposta do ITF para o El Ni\u00f1o-Oscila\u00e7\u00e3o Sul (ENOS) foi avaliada. Durante cinco eventos de La Ni\u00f1a o \ntransporte de volume m\u00e9dio foi de ?16 Sv, e para cinco eventos de El Ni\u00f1o, em ?12 Sv. Os resultados mostram \num aumento abrupto no transporte de calor entre 2002 e 2012, o qual pode estar relacionado a mudan\u00e7as na \nquantidade de calor dentro do Oceano \u00cdndico para o mesmo per\u00edodo. Anomalias no transporte de calor foram \nanalisadas para os \u00faltimos anos da mesma s\u00e9rie temporal e tamb\u00e9m apresentou clara correla\u00e7\u00e3o com o \u00edndice \nNino3.4, configurando uma forte resposta do ITF para o El Ni\u00f1o de 2014/16. Experimentos num\u00e9ricos simulando \npart\u00edculas Lagrangianas foram implementados, com o objetivo de identificar origens de massas de \u00e1guas que \ncomp\u00f5em o ITF e correlacionar sinais de variabilidade do ITF na bacia de circula\u00e7\u00e3o do \u00cdndico e do Vazamento \ndas Agulhas. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Indonesian Throughflow; Vazamento das Agulhas; ENOS; tra\u00e7adores \nLagrangianos \n\n\n\n \n\n1 | INTRODUCTION \n\n1.1 THE INDONESIAN THROUGHFLOW \n\nThe flux of waters at tropical latitudes from the Pacific Ocean (PO) toward the \n\nIndian Ocean (IO) basin, traveling through different straits and seas around the \n\nIndonesian islands, corresponds to the so called Indonesian Throughflow (ITF), which is \n\nalso part of the superficial branch of the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) and, \n\nas such, integrant part of the global climate system (Sprintall et al., 2014). The ITF is \n\nthe only pathway connecting large ocean basins in low latitudes, permitting the exchange \n\nof warm and fresh waters that could carry different climate signals and anomalies \n\n(Godfrey, 1996; Hirst &amp; Godfrey, 1993; Schneider, 1998; Wajsowicz &amp; Schneider, 2001).  \n\nTo describe the ITF pathway, in a general way, one can say that surface waters \n\ncoming from the North Pacific enter the Indonesian seas by flowing through Makassar \n\nstrait (see Fig. 1.1), whose pathway corresponds to approximately 80% of total inflow \n\ntransport. Because of the 680 m deep sill, only upper thermocline waters may flow into \n\nthe Flores Sea. There, to the south of Makassar, the flux bifurcates. The western branch \n\nexits directly towards the Indian Ocean, passing through Lombok strait. The other \n\nretroflects eastward to the Banda Sea, and then exits the ITF system by flowing through \n\nthe Ombai strait or the Timor passage. Deeper waters, from the South Pacific (denser \n\nthan North Pacific ones), come in the system travelling through Lifamatola passage (Fig. \n\n1.1), with 1940 m depth sill. The flux follows toward Banda sea, where these water masses \n\nare modified by different processes, and eventually goes out also flowing through both \n\nsides of Timor island (Gordon, 1995; Gordon and Fine, 1996; Gordon et al, 1999; Gordon, \n\n2005; Mayer et al., 2010; Tillinger and Gordon, 2010; Sprintall et al., 2009). \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION 14 \n \n\n \n \n \n\nFIGURE 1.1 | ITF domain in the globe (left) and water masses route flowing through different straits (right). \nFollowing the surface flow, North Pacific waters (blue) come into the system crossing the Makassar strait, \ntransporting about 80% of all ITF volume. Intermediate waters, below the thermocline, carry South Pacific waters \n(red) into the archipelago\u2019s circulation crossing the Lifamatola Passage. Waters flowing through Timor, Ombai \nand Lombok straits represent almost all the volume exported from the ITF system into the Indian Ocean. Values \nindicate the annual mean volume transport, in Sverdrups (1 Sv = 106 m3/s), across the main straits for the inflow \nand the outflow (adapted from Gordon and Fine, 1996). \n\nPrevious works (Gordon et al., 1999; Susanto and Gordon, 2005; van Aken et \n\nal., 1988) estimated a total ITF volume transport of approximately 10 Sv. However, \n\nrecently, the International Nusantara Stratification and Transport (INSTANT) program \n\nhas made direct measurements (Sprintall et al., 2004; see also:  www.marine.csiro.au/ \n\n~cow074/index.htm) of the ITF in all major inflow and outflow passages, providing \n\nobservational data for more accurate estimates of transports along the flow. The analysis \n\nL\nifa\n\nm\na\nto\nla\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION 15 \n \n\nof data between 2004 and 2006 (Sprintall et al., 2009; Gordon et al., 2010) suggests a \n\ntotal transport considerably larger: average transport through Makassar of ?12 Sv; \nLifamatola ?2.5 Sv; Lombok ?2.6 Sv; Ombai ?4.9 Sv and Timor: ?7.5 Sv. A mean \ntotal inflow transport was estimated in ?12.7 Sv and outflow ?15 Sv.  \n\nNot just being a very intricate ocean flow, and besides promoting an exchange \n\npathway, ITF also plays a key role in the ocean circulation, modifying the original \n\nPacific\u2019s waters characteristics within the Indonesian seas before depositing them into \n\nthe Indian Ocean, creating a very particular stratification profile in that region. As shown \n\nin Fig. 1.2, waters poured into the Indian Ocean from ITF (locations \u201cix\u201d and \u201cx\u201d) reveal \n\nvertical profiles of salinity and temperature quite different of those ones flowing into the \n\narchipelago seas from the Pacific Ocean (locations \u201ci\u201d, \u201civ\u201d, and \u201cv\u201d, for example).\t With \na shallow topography, most of the colder Pacific waters that manage to flow through  \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFIGURE 1.2 | Stratification in the Indonesian Seas: samples of waters from different positions labeled as \n\u201ci, ii, iii, \u2026 , x\u201d, are shown in the graph and are associated to their own local T-S diagram, \nrepresenting the temperature in the vertical axis and salinity in the horizontal one.

This last one, is also fresher and cooler than the \n\nones placed at its inflow pathway in Makassar strait (position \u201cii\u201d) because, as revealed \n\nby the profile of position \u201cix\u201d, this waters flowing out of the ITF, crossing the Lombok \n\nstrait, have been also modified in Java Sea (position \u201cvi\u201d). \n\nOnce incorporated in the Indian Ocean, the waters transported by ITF can be \n\nnow advected toward the African continent, flowing westward with the South Equatorial \n\nCurrent and eventually exit out the Indian Ocean basin, carried mostly by the Agulhas \n\nCurrent, and leaks into the South Atlantic (SA) Ocean (Le Bars et al., 2013). \n\nThus, the states of the Indian and Atlantic oceans are directly affected by the \n\nheat and volume transported by ITF (Lee et al., 2002), modulating the regional climate \n\nwhile regional patterns of precipitation and air-sea interaction vary (Wajsowicz, 2002).   \n\nThe ITF is also reported as being strongly influenced by climate conditions and \n\npresents itself high seasonal and interannual variabilities (Murtugudde et al., 1998; \n\nSchiller et al, 2010), part related to air-sea interaction,  for instance, to the typical \n\nmonsoonal winds of the region, and also due to ocean circulation variability, as revealed \n\nby notable responses of ITF to the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), to the Pacific \n\nDecadal Oscillation (PDO) and to the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) (England &amp; Huang, \n\n2005; Gordon et al., 2010; van Sebille et al., 2014; Wilson et al., 2013; Wunsch, 2010; \n\nZhou et al., 2015; Li et al., 2018). \n\nThe imbalance ~2 Sv was reported by these authors, and it is compatible with \nthe uncertainty of the data and the standard deviation. There are also some issues \n\nconcerning the INSTANT mooring array, leading to poor extrapolations for side-walls \n\nand incomplete measurements in inflow passages. At Lifamatola passage, there is a \n\nreversing direction of the flux (to north in surface, and to south below 1250 m). Also, \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION 17 \n \n\nthe Karimata strait1 (50 m sill), is not considered in the moorings, and it is known that \n\nflows crossing it allows introducing South China Sea water into the Java Sea (Susanto \n\net al., 2013). \n\n1.2 THE AGULHAS LEAKAGE \n\nThe Pacific waters, processed and modified by ITF, once merged into the Indian \n\nOcean, can now be carried away by the South Equatorial Current to the west side of the \n\nIO basin to be incorporated into the IO subtropical gyre. Flowing southward within the \n\nAgulhas Current (AC), eventually, these fully modified waters, that now hold the local \n\nIO properties, can leak into the South Atlantic, through a strongly non-linear flow, \n\nbounded by the South Africa\u2019s coastline, known as the Agulhas Leakage (AL). The whole \n\npathway, from the tropical Pacific to the South Atlantic Ocean, constitutes part of the \n\nglobal MOC \u201cwarm route\u201d, that is fundamental in modulating the state of the Earth\u2019s \n\nClimate System (ECS). Studies with climate models showed, for example, changes in the \n\nMOC can be correlated, in genesis and intensity, to precipitation patterns and decadal \n\nvariabilities of extreme atmospheric events (Hu et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2017). \n\nThe AC is the western boundary current that, similarly to the Brazil Current, \n\nflows along the western portion of the wind driven subtropical gyre in the Indian Ocean \n\n(Lutjeharms, 2006). As in the South Atlantic, the subtropical gyre is bounded to the \n\nsouth by the Subtropical Front, associated to the zone of zero wind stress curl, located \n\nat approximately 45\u00b0S, and corresponds to the region where the Westerlies are maximum. \n\nDifferently from South America, though, the African continent is delimited to \n\nthe north of this latitude. In the absence of any forcing, the AC would tend to flow into \n\nthe Atlantic, advected to the west by planetary waves, forming a \u201csuper gyre\u201d that would \n\n                                       \n1 Karimata strait is located to the southwest of Borneo island, and it is out of the bounds of all \n\nmaps showed in this chapter, which have been extracted or adapted from their original \nreferenced sources. Please, see Figs. 3.1 and 3.3, in Chapter 3, to visualize the ITF straits \nconsidered in this work. \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION 18 \n \n\nconnect both basins (de Ruijter, 1982; de Ruijter et al., 1999). However, forced inertially \n\nsouthward, the current accumulates anticyclonic relative vorticity due to changes in the \n\nlocal planetary vorticity (\u201c\" effect\u201d), and once the current approaches the latitude where \nthe African continent\u2019s margin ends, the bathymetry change enhances this effect, \n\neventually making the movement to deflect to the east, flowing back into the Indian \n\nOcean. This process has been referred as the Agulhas Current retroflection (Lutjeharms, \n\n2006; Beal et al., 2011).  \n\nBut the retroflection is not a stationary phenomenon. The inertial state of the \n\nAC and the location of the line of zero wind stress curl depend on the general distribution \n\nof the wind over the Indian Ocean. Mesoscale (baroclinic and/or barotropic) instabilities \n\ntransfer energy from the main flow, producing the increase of the retroflection loop \n\npredominantly to the west, before the current could flow back toward the IO basin. \n\nEventually, the loop can close and release itself from the current, forming the Agulhas \n\nrings: anticyclonic eddies propagating westward and transporting with them a relevant \n\nvolume of IO waters into the SA Ocean (Speich et al., 2006; Zarkhov &amp; Nof, 2008). \n\nIn addition to the current\u2019s inertia and instability processes, the latitude of zero \n\nwind stress curl, together with the bottom topography and the coastline geometry also \n\ninfluence the rings\u2019 generation, playing an important role in controlling the retroflection. \n\nFor instance, supposing this latitude line was too close to the African continent border, \n\nthe AC would be simply deflected to the east along this latitude, resulting in a reduced \n\nor even in an absence of the IO waters leaking into the Atlantic. Paleoclimate indicators \n\nsuggest this \u201cinertial shock\u201d situation already happened in the past and could be \n\nassociated with climate changes (Peeters et al., 2004).  \n\nOn the other hand, simulations with wind driven ocean models show that \n\nchanges in the atmosphere circulation, in response to global warming, have been \n\nproduced an increase in the AL and, also, a possible weaker MOC (Biastoch et al., 2008). \n\nFig. 1.3 illustrates the process. It shows the pathway connecting different basins: the  \n \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION 19 \n \n\n \n \n\nFIGURE 1.3 | Schematic representation of the wind-driven circulation in the South Atlantic and Indian Ocean, \npointing out subtropical gyres and the Agulhas Leakage. On the right, graphs show the zonal mean of the wind \nstress for two periods: from 1965 to 1974 (blue) and from 1995 to 2004 (red). It reveals the Westerlies \nintensification and the displacement of the latitude lines where these winds are maximum to the south, between \n45\u00b0S and 60\u00b0S. (adapted from Beal et al., 2011) \n\nIndian Ocean, fed with Pacific Ocean waters coming from ITF and the Tasman leakage \n\n(south of Australia), is connected to the South Atlantic Ocean through the Agulhas \n\nSystem. In the west side of the Atlantic basin, part of the flow is incorporated to the \n\nsubtropical gyre, and the other flows northward to form the Atlantic Meridional  \n \n\nOverturning Circulation (AMOC). The line defined by the latitudes in which the \n\nWesterlies are maximum delimits both SA and IO subtropical gyres (black curves), the \n\nSubtropical Front (grey wide line) and a \u201csuper gyre\u201d (dashed grey line): an inter-basin \n\ncirculation pattern, exchanging waters from the South Atlantic to the Pacific, that \n\neventually flows back into the Indian Ocean. The graph on the right shows the meridional \n\nprofile for the westerly wind stress during two different periods. The blue and red arrows \n\nhighlight the latitudes for the maximum shear stress and suggests it can be changing \n\nover recent years, as that position was pushed to the south and the values of wind stress \n\nare higher for the last period (1995-2004) if compared to the first one (1964-1974). \n\nThis phenomenon is known as the southward expansion of the Southern \n\nHemisphere mid-latitude westerly wind (Biastoch et al., 2009), and has been associated \n\nto the anthropogenic global climate change (Biastoch &amp; B\u00f6ning, 2013).

This could cause an increase in the \n\nleakage of waters from the Indian to the Atlantic Ocean, because the Subtropical Front \n\ndelimits the retroflection and the rings\u2019 formation. Thus, once it is shifting southward, a \n\nlonger distance between the south border of Africa and that delimiter line could make \n\nthe loops of the retroflection and the rings of the leakage become also larger, resulting in \n\nan increased inter-basin volume transport (Beal et al., 2011).  \n\nAlthough it is still not a consensus, a possible consequence for the Atlantic would \n\nbe related to the fact that the IO waters are hotter and more saline than the SA ones. \n\nAn increased AL could propagate this anomaly northward in the Atlantic, interfering \n\nwith the North Atlantic Deep Water formation that could lead to a weaker MOC \n\n(Biastoch et al., 2008; Delworth &amp; Zeng, 2008). In addition, numerical experiments \n\nusing low resolution coupled ocean-atmosphere models show anomalies in the region of \n\nthe AC retroflection propagate far away the atmosphere, inside the thermocline, and \n\nresurge to surface in equatorial regions (e.g.: Haarsma et al., 2009), where these \n\nanomalies would be able to change properties of the ocean mixed layer, acting on the air-\n\nsea interaction processes. \n\n1.3 THE GLOBAL WARMING HIATUS \n\nSuch as the Agulhas Leakage, apart from simple correlations with the ECS \n\nvariability modes, the ITF \u2013 as the main pathway to connect the great Indo-Pacific \n\nSystem \u2013 has a fundamental hole on the heat distribution all over the globe, transporting \n\nsignificant energy and transferring anomalies from the tropical upper ocean into the \n\nglobal conveyor belt (Tillinger &amp; Gordon, 2010). \n\nLee et al. (2015), for example, simulated the abrupt increase of the Indian Ocean \n\nheat content in the upper 700 m, as observed in past years, and could establish its origin \n\nin heat budget anomalies of the Pacific Ocean, which was tagged to be abruptly cooling \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION 21 \n \n\nfor the same period. The heat sent to the Indian Ocean, must have traveled from a basin \n\nto the other by flowing westward through the Indonesian islands. In addition, authors \n\npointed out this dynamic could be causally related to the so-called global warming hiatus, \n\nthat hereafter will be referred as the hiatus. \n\nThe hiatus was a phenomenon marked by the slowdown of the Earth surface \n\nwarming observed over the first decade of the 21st century, when the increase rate of the \n\nGlobal Mean Surface Temperature (GMST) was less intense than observed in earlier \n\ndecades, and up to 4 times smaller than the one that had been represented by most \n\nclimate models for that period. This ended to misguide popular and some scientific-like \n\nbeliefs about an apparent \u201cpause\u201d in the global human-induced warmth (Easterling &amp; \n\nWehner, 2009). However, empiric observations of the ECS, such as measurements of the \n\ntop of atmosphere, heat budgets, snow and ice covers, sea level, among others, aligned \n\nwith record levels of carbon emissions, used to keep pointing out a warming planet (Fyfe \n\net al., 2013; Trenberth &amp; Fasullo, 2013; Xie et al, 2016; Seneviratne et al., 2014). \n\nIn fact, \u201chiatuses\u201d are climate change natural fluctuations that happen due to \n\nnonlinear behaviors of the ECS and have been observed for long- and near-term scales \n\nof climate estimation in the past (Lovejoy, 2014; Lewandowsky et al., 2015). The most \n\nrecent one, would have begun just after the 1997/98 El Ni\u00f1o event, classified as \u201cvery \n\nstrong\u201d and once referred as \u201cthe climate event of the 20th century\u201d (Changnon &amp; Bell, \n\n2000; Slingo &amp; Annamalai, 2000), and no longer observed as the effects of the successive \n\nLa Ni\u00f1a events spanning 2010/2012 have been completely gone. \n\nAlthough the causes and abrupt origins of the recent hiatus are not completely \n\nclarified, they have been associated to distinct natural factors, to name a few: internal \n\nclimate variabilities (Watanabe et al., 2014; Trenberth, 2015; Dai et al., 2015), water \n\nvapor (Solomon et al., 2010), volcanic activity (Haywood, et al., 2014; Maher et al., \n\n2014; Ridley et al., 2014; Santer et al., 2014), reduction in the solar radiation forcing \n\n(Folland et al., 2018), and even biases associated to the data utilized in warming \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION 22 \n \n\nestimates (Karl, 2015). It has been claimed, for example, the fast warming of the Arctic \n\ncould have been underestimated (Cowtan &amp;. Way, 2014), what would cause the hiatus \n\nto be statistically insignificant (Huang et al., 2017).  \n\nHowever, Fyfe et al. (2016) suggested that, to make sense of the early-2000\u2019s \n\nsurface warming slowdown, a different historical base-period comprising the 2000/2001 \n\nLa Ni\u00f1a event should be employed to compare increase rates of the GMST rather than \n\nthe usual 1971\u20131998 one, what would clearly reveal different scenarios for the first decade \n\nof the 21st century and the last years of the 20th century.  \n\nFig. 1.4 illustrates this overview. The big hiatus that happened between 1945 \n\nand 1970 is likely related to aerosols effect, that reduced the solar insolation. The Clear \n\nAir acts of the 1970\u2019s ended that era.

In \n\nmost cases, however, the Ocean has been the particular component of the ECS to be \n\nexplored as a fundamental key to analyze the surface warming slowdown for longer than \n\na decade in a human-induced warming planet, as part of a natural variability along the \n\nwarmth process that did not cease (Katsman &amp; van Oldenborgh, 2011; Loeb et al., 2012; \n\nMeehl et al., 2011; Kosaka &amp; Xie, 2013; Aschmann et al., 2014; Cheng et al., 2015; Liu \n\net al., 2016; Song et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017). \n\nPart of the oceanic contribution for the slowdown is, therefore, likely to be \n\nrelated with the thermal capacity of sea water, that makes the ocean a \u201cnatural sink\u201d \n\nfor the atmosphere, acting on the inter-basin heat uptake that plays a fundamental hole \n\non the global vertical distribution of heat (Drijfhout et al., 2014), associated to internal \n\ndynamics of the ocean circulation that presents themselves decadal and multidecadal \n\nvariabilities.  \n\nDespite the fact most of the referenced studies do not agree with which ocean \n\nbasin or variability mode can be associated to the surface warming slowdown, it seems \n\nlike each great basin holds its own time scale of contribution. Although not conclusive, \n\nthe Atlantic Ocean is thought to drive longer scales, being tide to multidecadal \n\nvariabilities of the ECS internal variability, mostly correlated to the AMOC and to the \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION 24 \n \n\nAtlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) \u2013 whose period vary between 60 to 80 years. \n\nThe Pacific Ocean is more likely to contribute to interannual variability especially due \n\nto ENSO, but also to multidecadal variability, linked with PDO in two distinct signals, \n\none almost bidecadal \u2013 period varying 16 to 20 years \u2013 and other multidecadal that is \n\nsomehow connected to AMO (Steinman et al., 2015). \n\nFor all the cases, AMO, ENSO and PDO present themselves chaotic phases, \n\nmaking it difficult to establish a linear causal relation with them and the hiatus. The \n\nIndian Ocean also presents an interannual variability, but it is still not clear if the IOD \n\nis a global mode of variability, although it interacts strongly with ENSO. \n\n1.4 MOTIVATION AND OVERVIEW \n\nThe present work is motivated based on the following evaluations:  \n\n\u2022 the Atlantic Ocean is the basin that has absorbed the biggest amount of \n\nheat since 1970, with a rate of ~2 \u00d7 1022 J per decade, what is almost the \nrate of the Pacific (~1.5 \u00d7 1022  J per decade) and the Indian Ocean \n(~0.5 \u00d7 1022 J per decade) combined, and it would be likely related to an \nenhanced Agulhas Leakage over the last years (Lee et al., 2011). During \n\nthe recent warming slowdown, however, the deep (700 \u2013 1500 m) heat \n\nuptake was observed, and it would be rather related with the \n\nanthropogenic warming than to the hiatus (Liu et al., 2015); \n\n\u2022 Shallow La Ni\u00f1a-like conditions in the Pacific Ocean during the hiatus \n\nare associated with increasing Ocean Heat Content (OHC) in subsurface \n\nin the Indian Ocean (Lee et al., 2015); \n\n\u2022 The Western Indian Ocean has been warmed for more than a century, \n\nand the Indian Ocean is becoming more active, making its strong \n\nconnection with the Pacific Ocean to be gradually weaker in the last years \n\n(Roxy et al., 2014). \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION 25 \n \n\nThat makes the Indonesian Throughflow \u2013 that connects the tropical Pacific \n\nOcean to the Indian Ocean \u2013, and the Agulhas Leakage \u2013 that connects the Indo-Pacific \n\nto the Atlantic \u2013 constitute main oceanic systems to explore correlations of the recent \n\nslowdown of the GMST warming with the upper ocean circulation. \n\n1.5 HYPOTHESES  \n\ni) Changes in the upper Indian Ocean\u2019s heat content during the surface \n\nwarming slowdown hold correlations with ITF trends. \n\nii) The enhanced leakage of waters from the Indian Ocean to the South \n\nAtlantic Ocean, which is increasing in response to global warming, can cause \n\nthe SA Ocean circulation to be directly affected by variabilities and changes \n\nof ITF and in the Agulhas system. \n\n1.6 OBJECTIVES \n\nThe main objectives of the present work are: \n1) to investigate the structure and variability of the Indonesian Throughflow \n\nas represented in output data of a global implementation of an eddy-\nresolving model of the ocean circulation, considering the global warming \nscenario and its recent slowdown; \n\n2) to implement a fully operational Lagrangian Analysis that can establish the \nstudy of direct connections of the South Atlantic Ocean with the Agulhas \nLeakage and the Indonesian Throughflow, using open-source algorithms of \nvirtual particles\u2019 tracking, in a comparison set of numerical experiments \nemploying output data of the high-resolution ocean circulation model. \n\nSome specific objectives can be pointed out: \no analyze results of a global implementation of the ocean circulation model \n\nconsidering climatological and interannual forcings; \n\no evaluate general aspects related to circulation pattern, temperature and \nsalinity profiles of ITF; \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION 26 \n \n\no Study ITF variability in the intraseasonal, interannual, decadal and \nmultidecadal timescales; \n\no Evaluate volume and heat transports related to ITF and their variabilities; \n\no Identify and explore possible long-term trends in the time series obtained; \n\no Design and implement numerical experiments using virtual particle tracking \nthat permits interocean exchange Lagrangian analysis; \n\n \n\nThe remaining of this document is structured in the following way. In Chapter \n\n2 it is presented a brief description of HYCOM, general aspects of the numerical \n\nexperiments conducted and an overview of the Lagrangian models. The results of the \n\nexperiments with HYCOM are described in Chapter 3, together with a comparison with \n\navailable observational data.  In Chapter 4 the status of the effort to develop the \n\nLagrangian tool is presented and discussed, with indications of the additional work \n\nneeded to reach a fully reliable and operational system. Finally, in Chapter 5, a summary \n\nwith main results and conclusions are presented, ending with suggestions for future work \n\nand recent scientific production overview. \n\n\n\n \n\n2 | NUMERICAL TOOLS \n\n2.1 THE OCEAN CIRCULATION MODEL \n\nHYCOM is an Ocean General Circulation Model (OGCM) designed with \n\ndifferent vertical coordinate schemes to better represent the ocean circulation according \n\nto local characteristics (Bleck &amp; Benjamin, 1993; Bleck, 2002). In its \u201chybrid\u201d approach, \n\nthe vertical coordinates remain isopycnic in the stratified regions of the open ocean, below \n\nthe surface mixed-layer and far from the boundaries. In the weakly stratified upper-ocean \n\nmixed-layer, the isopycnic vertical coordinates smoothly transition to z-coordinates and \n\nin shallow water regions the coordinates are dynamically converted to terrain-following \n\nsigma coordinates. In very shallow waters, along the coastal regions, the coordinates are \n\nturned back to z-levels (Fig. 2.1). \n\nThe Laboratory for Modeling and Observations of the Ocean (LABMON) of the \n\nOceanographic Institute of the University of Sao Paulo (IOUSP), in collaboration with \n\nthe Center for Weather Forecasting and Climate Studies (CPTEC), utilized a setup of \n\nversion 2.1 of HYCOM, hereafter referred as GLBa0.08, to perform two numerical \n\nsimulations on the global ocean circulation: Expt. 18.1 \u2013 the Climatological Run \u2013, and \n\nExpt. 18.3 \u2013 the Interannual Forcing Run. \n\nFor the GLBa0.08 setup, the spatial domain used by HYCOM is discretized. \n\nThe horizonal coordinates are represented in terms of elements (&amp;'(, )'() sorted in a \nPanAm mesh: a hybrid projection combining Mercator for latitudes between 79\u00b0S and \n\n47\u00b0N and bipolar to the north of 47\u00b0N, resulting in a tripole global grid (Murray, 1996), \n\nwhere &amp; is the longitude and ) the latitude, + ? [1, 4500] and - ? [1, 3298] are the indices \nassociated to the horizontal grid nodes in eastward and northward directions, \n\n\n\nNUMERICAL TOOLS 28 \n \n\nrespectively. Thus, the spacing between two consecutive grid points in the zonal direction \n\nis:    ?&amp;(() = |&amp;' ? &amp;'? 1|(() = 1 12\u00b0? = 0.08\u00b0 (1) \nand in the meridional direction:   ?)(') = ?)( ? )(? 1?(') = 1 12\u00b0? ? cos )'( (2) \nThe result is a horizontal spacing (see Appendix A) given by:  ?4(() ? 56(') ? 78 1 12\u00b0?180\u00b0 9 cos )'( (3) \nwhere 78  is the mean radius of the Earth, resulting in 54 ~ 6.5 km for mid-latitudes \nand 54 ~ 3.5 km in the Arctic. \n\nFinally, the components of the vector fields are staggered on an Arakawa C-grid \n\n(Arakawa, 1972; Arakawa &amp; Lamb, 1977) to be evaluated on time. \n\nAlthough the model\u2019s equations are described by the hybrid system of vertical \n\ncoordinates (Arakawa &amp; Suarez, 1983; Bleck &amp; Benjamin, 1993; Bleck, 2002), the \n\nvertical structure of the spatial domain is represented by 32 layers of constant :2 = :2(:2 &lt;)  surfaces, where: \n \n\n:2 &lt;=  {28.1, 28.9, 29.7, 30.5, 30.95, 31.5, 32.05, 32.6, 33.15, \n33.7, 34.25, 34.75, 35.15, 35.5, 35.8, 36.04, 36.2, 36.38, 36.52, \n\n36.62, 36.7, 36.77, 36.83, 36.89, 36.97, 37.02, 37.06, 37.1, \n\n37.17, 37.3, 37.42, 37.48}  ( kg ? m-3 ) ; > ?

Each one of \n\nthese fields are evaluated in the grid points as:  B(+, -, A) = B',(,@ (6) \nwhere B represents any of the Eulerian fields given by the model and +, -, A are the indices \nof the spatial grid. \n\nIn addition, to these experiments, output of other one performed by the U.S \n\nNaval Research Laboratory (NRL), using a similar configuration of the same model \n\n(GLBa0.08), and labeled as Expt. 19.1, was considered for comparison and validation, \n\nand it is detailed in Section 2.1.3. \n\n2.1.1 Expt. 18.1 \u2013 Climatological Run \n\nData products of the Reanalysis 1 by National Center for Environmental \n\nPrediction (NCEP) National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) (Kalnay et al., \n\n1996) were used to force the model with atmospheric fields containing wind velocity and \n\nshear stress, heat and radiation fluxes, and precipitation data.  In this experiment (18.1), \n\nmonthly averaged data of the climatological year (mean state obtained by averaging the \n\nwhole time series) were used to force the model for 27 years. The ocean\u2019s initial state \n\nwas an arbitrary realization of a global run available at the HYCOM Consortium (see: \n\nwww.hycom.org). \n\nThat is to say, the model was started from a \u201cwarm\u201d initial condition. Output \n\nof the runs were written every six days, considering the mean values of all output \n\nvariables along the previous six days. Because, despite the \u201cwarm\u201d initialization, the \n\nmodel would take a time to stabilize, the first 10 years of the time series were considered \n\nas transient and were not used in the analyses performed in the present work.

The model\u2019s state in the end of the 20th year of the \n\nClimatological Run was used as initial condition for this experiment. As in the previous \n\nrun, the mean outputs were saved each six days.

The Consortium for Data \n\nAssimilative Modeling has performed some experiments with HYCOM involving the use \n\nof data assimilation, which adjusts the model with real empiric data provided by a certain \n\nreanalysis. Because the HYCOM runs performed by LABMON have no data assimilation, \n\nsome tests were done using results of HYCOM with data assimilation by NRL. \n\n \n\nFIGURE 2.5 | Sea Surface Temperature (SST) on December 1st, 2012 as represented by Expt 19.1 (NRL) \n\n\n\nNUMERICAL TOOLS 33 \n \n\n \n\nAt www.hycom.org is possible to find a description of a few experiments achieved \n\nusing HYCOM and the Navy Coupled Ocean Data Assimilation (NCODA) system \n\n(Cummings, 2005, Cummings &amp; Smedstad, 2013). NCODA considers the model forecast \n\nin a three-dimensional variational scheme and assimilates available satellite, and in situ \n\ndata of Sea Surface Temperature (SST), in situ vertical temperature and salinity profiles \n\nfrom XBTs, ARGO floats and moored buoys, and satellite altimeter observations. \n\nExpt. 19.1 was forced with NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) \n\ndata (Saha et al., 2006) and fulfill a date range from Aug. 1995 to Dec. 2012.

It is a multiscale stochastic Lagrangian framework \n\ndeveloped at the Rosenstiel School of Marine &amp; Atmospheric Science (RSMAS), at the \n\nUniversity of Miami, to study complex migrations and provide probability estimates of \n\ndispersion, connectivity, fate of pollutants, and other Lagrangian phenomena (Paris et \n\nal., 2013). The tool is inherently multiscale, allowing for the seamless moving of particles \n\nbetween grids at different resolutions, for the multi-scale tracking of biotic and abiotic \n\nparticles in the ocean.  \n\nAs a modular software, CMS permits adding or removing behaviors of the \n\nparticles being simulated as such as of the software by itself. Pre-built modules include \n\nthe Parallel, the Multiscale, the Landmask Boundary, the Vertical Movement, the \n\nConnectivity Matrix and the Flexible Input and Output ones. Other Modules also present \n\nin CMS are related to biological studies, such as the Individual Based Model \u2013 which \n\nallows giving particles specific behaviors \u2013 the Buoyancy Module \u2013 applied, for example, \n\nto simulate buoyancy of larval eggs \u2013 and the Seascape Module \u2013 that can be used to \n\nsimulate different marine habitats and their connectivity. \n\n2.2.1 The CMS Algorithm \n\nBasically, CMS works \u201coffline\u201d by reading locally stored data that provide fields  \n\nof the Eulerian velocity components along the time of simulation and spatial domain \n\ndesired. Additional information can be considered, as temperature, salinity, and density, \n\nas such as individual behaviors for each passive or active particle, that can also be \n\nassociated to a specific habitat. In this last case, CMS is able to provide outputs with \n\ninformation connecting initial and final position to the corresponding habitats and their \n\nparticles when released and killed: the outstanding feature of CMS, more frequently \n\n\n\nNUMERICAL TOOLS 35 \n \n\napplied for biological purposes. \n\nUsually, the velocity field is provided by OGCMs output data, that can present \n\nthree components: u (eastward velocity), v (northward velocity), and w (vertical \n\nvelocity); or only two: u and v. The user needs to detail every single particle that must \n\nbe considered for the numerical experiment with CMS, informing, at least, position and \n\ndate of releasing for each single particle, with the condition the offline data must provide \n\nthe velocity fields and other additional variable needed to compute individual behaviors \n\n(as water density and water temperature) at the exact location where the particle is \n\nbeing released for advection. The. multi-scale module permits to utilize data from \n\ndifferent runs and different OGCMs for different spatial domain, by coupling them with \n\na smooth transition. \n\nThen, the user settles details for the advection method, that can be either \n\ndeterministic, following the velocity field in data, or also stochastic, where random small \n\nkicks are given on the particle\u2019s velocity components at every time step desired to \n\nsimulate any dynamic process not solved by the OGCM. For evaluating particle \n\nadvection, CMS uses a 4th order Runge-Kutta scheme, and it is applied both in time and \n\nspace (Paris et al., 2013). \n\nFor position, CMS uses a tricubic interpolation method, where 64 neighboring \n\ngrid nodes are used for each dimension of the OGCM output, by using a third-degree \n\n(cubic) polynomial fitted to the data in every 4 points of each dimension (4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 =64). For the case in which a two dimensional only Eulerian velocity field is given, then \nCMS will compute a simpler bicubic method. That is aimed to set the position of the \n\nparticle in the grid points of the model grid and then compute variables\u2019 values. A simple \n\nlinear interpolation over time is also performed to adjust the instantaneous velocity fields \n\nbetween consecutive snapshots of the integration method and input data, as necessary. \n\nThe particle located at the new numerically integrated position, one time step \n\nahead, is now susceptible to the Eulerian fields interpolated at this new position and \n\n\n\nNUMERICAL TOOLS 36 \n \n\ntime, as provided by the OGCM data. Thus, a new integration process begins, and the \n\ntrajectory of each particle released in the ensemble is saved in an CMS output file. A \n\nbasic flow chart of the complete code is shown in Fig 2.4, adapted from Paris et al., 2013. \n\nCMS is previously prepared to run in multiprocessors computers, through its \n\nparallel module, that uses the Message Passage Interface (MPI) library, so a proper \n\ncompiler that supports MPI is also necessary if parallel computing is intended to be \n\napplied. CMS supports access to on-the-fly ocean circulation data via OPeNADP, and it \n\nis also able to read local files of OGCM data in NetCDF, and write output files (with \n\nthe CMS results) in both NetCDF or ASCII formats. \n \n\n \n \n\nFIGURE 2.6 | Flowchart of CMS, showing the Input process and interpolation grid needs, the Lagrangian \nCode and its modules, and the Output possibilities (adapted from Paris et al., 2013). \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\nNUMERICAL TOOLS 37 \n \n\n2.3 THE PARCELS ALGORITHM \n\nProbably, A Really Computationally Efficient Lagrangian Simulator \n\n(PARCELS) is a set of Python classes and methods developed in the OceanParcels \n\nProject to create customized simulations of particles\u2019 trajectories based on output data \n\nof OGCMs. PARCELS can be used to track passive and active particulates, such as \n\nwater, plankton, plastic and fish (Lange &amp; van Sebille, 2017). It is open source, under an \n\nMIT license, and can be downloaded at https://github.com/OceanParcels/parcels. The \n\nproject also keeps a dedicate webpage at www.oceanparcels.org, where a number of \n\ntutorials on the numerical simulator is available to provide an overview of how to use \n\nthe algorithm and customize experiments. \n\nThis code is designed to match computing needs over the \u201cpetaescale era\u201d: the \n\ncurrent time of human civilization whose technological development allows for \n\nmultiprocessor systems that are capable of achieving computer performances that exceed 1 DEFGHIJD = 1,000,000,000,000,000 logical operations per second. \nFollowing computing evolution, the OGCMs and Climate Models have also \n\nbegun to be implemented in experiments that request an increasingly higher spatial and \n\ntemporal grid resolutions. Higher resolution models usually mean higher fidelity of the \n\nresults obtained from these models and the real life, but with that is brought a significant \n\nincrease in storage and physical memory demand, once amounts of data reaching more \n\nthan hundreds of terabytes represent outputs of a single experiment. \n\nThus, beyond the models themselves, the methods and tools concepted to process \n\nand analyze all that resulting information should also follow the same computing \n\ndevelopment timescale. However, numerical algorithms of Lagrangian Ocean Analysis \n\ncurrently available are not, at the same time, customizable or computationally efficient \n\nenough to match the increasing complexity requests of numerical experiments, the \n\nvolume of data produced by the high resolution OGCMs, and the individual needs of \n\neach simulation proposal, whose may present diversified objectives, spatial domain or \n\n\n\nNUMERICAL TOOLS 38 \n \n\ntimescales of interest, and formats of the OGCMs\u2019 output files. \n\nDeveloped from the ground up, PARCELS tries to fulfill these requirements with \n\na code supposedly prepared for an efficient data communication (API) at the same time \n\nit was designed to operate optimally in high computational performance. Actually, the \n\nmost intriguing aspect of the PARCELS code is the base language chosen by its designers \n\nto accomplish all that: Python.  \n\nPopular among computing enthusiasts and in many fields of Math and Science, \n\nPython gained popularity recently thanks to its more user-friendly interaction when \n\ncompared to more traditional programming languages, such as Pascal, Cobol, Assembly, \n\nC, and Fortran. Nowadays, there are several Python-based tools, freely distributed on \n\ninternet, intended for innumerous tasks, such as bi and three-dimensional graph plotting, \n\ntime series analysis, scientific data processing, web browser and data base servers \n\ncommunicating, etc. But, despite of that, Python also got famous for its reputation of \n\nbeing considerably slower, especially if compared to C or Fortran \u2013 the preferred \n\nlanguages when it comes to efficiency and performance. \n\nTo satisfy this request PARCELS makes use of the CPython library, which \n\ncombines a Python interface with a C-based processing algorithm. Thus, it can generate \n\na low-level C code for routines that demand higher performance, through a run-time \n\ncompilating CPython code (Just-in-time compilation), making it suitable for critical \n\nperforming computation. \n\nThe code, in a general way, presents a deep level of abstraction that hides from \n\nthe user details about inherent aspects of the algorithm work, as grid changing, \n\ninterpolation, units of measurement, etc. The algorithm is able to read data saved in \n\nmost common formats for big datasets (such as NetCDF, ASCII, etc.) and easily scale \n\nthe velocity fields and any other variable, which can be written in almost any spatial \n\ngrid, including the generalized vertical ones (like the :2 one adopted by HYCOM or the \none from curvilinear grids, or even any other Cartesian orthogonal ones). The algorithm \n\n\n\nNUMERICAL TOOLS 39 \n \n\ncan handle missing data and data is used as is, then only the interpolations that are \n\nrequired to evaluate the Eulerian field at a specific particle\u2019s position and instant of time \n\nare performed during the execution of the simulation. The Eulerian fields data may be \n\nprovided by different sources, from different models and grids, the code is also able to \n\nperform a loop over the data boundaries and evaluate the initial particles\u2019 positioning on \n\na line, or an external file, and the same ensemble can be released every customizable \n\ninterval, and they are advected until some specific date and time or until a maximum \n\nsimulation time. These aspects may save a valuable time when it comes to the tuning \n\nand implementation of experiments, and reveal a great advantage over other Lagrangian \n\nsimulators, as the CMS, for example. \n\nFigure 3.1 shows a schematic diagram of the functional abstraction with which \n\nthe model was conceived: The user should define: the variables of the system; the \n\nensemble of particles to be simulated and the customizable routines to be computed \n\nbesides the time advection (the so-called kernels). The algorithm is responsible for \n\nperforming the time integration loop and updating the state of the particle ensemble, \n\nadapting the OGCMs Eulerian fields data as needed and writing the output files. It is \n\nstill possible to visualize, in real time, the simulated movement of the ensemble of \n\nparticles, and the temporal variation of the velocity field or any other property. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFIGURE 2.7 | PARCELS algorithm flowchart. The code was conceived in a high abstraction level, requesting \nfrom the user the strictly necessary input information. (Adapted from Lange &amp; van Sebille, 2017) \n\n\n\nNUMERICAL TOOLS 40 \n \n\nFinally, the user can create as many custom kernels as he wants or needs. A \n\nkernel is the outstanding feature of PARCELS, defined as a customizable and versatile \n\nroutine algorithm, write by the user, that will be evaluated along the simulation, and \n\ncan be a function of any field or variable, allowing the user to assign a special or \n\nindividualized behavior to the particles. That may represent, for example: boundaries of \n\nintegration for each particle in terms of their life time, mortality rate, or habitat; a \n\ndiscretized model for biotic or abiotic tracer; an along trajectory sampling of the fluid\u2019s \n\nproperties \u2013 such as temperature, salinity, nutrients, etc.; any specific actions matching \n\nconditional clauses, useful in cases which the particle may be placed at certain non-\n\nrealistic or killing depth, or if it approaches the coast; etc. \n\nIn a matter of fact, PARCELS and CMS employ the same numerical method for \n\nadvection, the 4th order Runge-Kutta, two- or three-dimensional; but the PARCELS\u2019s \n\nuser can also choose between the Runge-Kutta45 (a varying timestep method) or the \n\nsimpler Euler forward, instead. A stochastic method to simulate horizontal diffusion is \n\nimplemented in the code, described by a simple Brownian motion. \n\nFor post-processing analysis, PARCELS brings a number of scripts and methods \n\nfor graphical visualization of the simulated results, whose output can be written in an \n\nadjustable chunk size NetCDF format, that can be adapted to reduce the final volume \n\nof data saved in disk. In addition, a vast library of Python tools is freely distributed by \n\ndiverse sources, and they can be used with PARCELS\u2019s output files. An extensive \n\ndocumentation and a set of tutorials for PARCELS is supplied by the OceanParcels \n\nwebpage, making the installing process and the initial familiarization with the algorithm \n\nand its features, for any user that holds a minimum knowledge of computer programing, \n\neven if new to Python specifically, to become easy and clear. \n\nHowever, PARCELS is not yet fully prepared for large simulations that considers \n\nlong time series, and high resolution OGCM, once the implementation of parallel \n\nprocessing is a functionality still in development stage and promised for its next versions. \n\n\n\n \n\n3 | EULERIAN ANALYSIS OF THE \nINDONESIAN THROUGHFLOW \n\nThis chapter discusses the ITF based on the HYCOM experiments performed at \n\nLABMON (here referred as Expt 18.1 and Expt. 18.3) and a short analysis for the Expt. \n\n19.1 with HYCOM+NCODA performed by NRL.   \n\nThe output of the climatological run (Expt. 18.1) was analyzed to identify the \n\naverage patterns concerning the ITF circulation and of the vertical profiles of speed, \n\ntemperature and salinity along the straits that compounds the inflow and outflow \n\npathways, considering a Eulerian framework. \n\nThe volume transport was estimated in the upper 700 m depth. The time series \n\nof this run, once there is no interannual variability forcing, was also used to determine \n\nthe seasonal variability of ITF. On the other hand, the run forced with inter-annually \n\nvarying data was studied to analyze interannual ITF  variabilities, the expected responses \n\nto ENSO and long-term trends, considering the volume and heat transports in each strait, \n\nalso in the upper 700 m. \n\nTo obtain a more accurate result, in addition to the estimations of the transports \n\nacross Makassar, Lombok, Ombai and Timor straits, two more regions were also \n\nconsidered: the Karimata Strait, located to southeast of Borneo island; and another small \n\nstrait to the south of Flores Sea. \n\nFurthermore, instead of computing the transports along Lifamatola passage, an \n\nalternative section crossing small islands to south of Maluku Sea was been chosen. Thus, \n\nthe inflow pathway comprehends the Karimata, Makassar and Moluccas sections; and \n\nthe outflow, Lombok, Flores, Ombai and Timor sections. This methodology allows to \n\n\n\nEULERIAN ANALYSIS OF ITF 42 \n \n\nacquire values in more grid points and leads to a closer ITF domain. Fig. 3.1 illustrates \n\nthe names and location of all straits considered for calculations. Lifamatola passage is \n\nhighlighter in Fig. 3.3.  \n\n3.1 AVERAGE FLOW AND PATHWAYS \u2013 CLIMATOLOGICAL RUN \n\nFig. 3.1 illustrates the spatial domain of ITF on the globe (top) and the contouring of \n\nthe average Sea Surface Height (SSH), colored by SSH variance, for the whole ten last \n\nyears of the Expt. 18.1 time series. As it has been previously shown (Mayer et al., 2010), \n\nthe ITF is mostly driven as part of the strong Tropical Pacific Ocean circulation, where \n\nthe western boundary is not completely closed when it reaches the Indonesian \n\narchipelago, allowing the flux to go through ITF straits. Thus, it is possible to note on \n\nnortheastern corner of the region plotted, the pathway of input of superficial waters from \n\nNorth Pacific into the Indonesian seas, where higher values of SSH around this poorly-\n\nclosed boundary indicate an accumulation of volume that cannot easily enter the \n\nIndonesian seas, generating local anomalies on the elevation of surface. Also, high values \n\nof SSH and SSH variance to northwestern of Australia indicate the mean surface flux \n\naround the outflow region. \n\nThe average horizontal velocity field in ITF has been plotted using data of the \n\nclimatological run, considering the mean field in the last ten years of the time series. The \n\nhorizontal map obtained for the mixed layer are shown in Fig. 3.2. For the superficial \n\nflow, as expected, waters coming from North Pacific enters the Indonesian seas mostly \n\nthrough Makassar strait, where one could observe a stronger southward flow, that reaches \n\nFlores Sea and bifurcates. The western branch goes straightly southward in direction of \n\nthe Lombok strait, where it is then injected into the Indian Ocean basin. The other \n\nbranch, in its turn, seems to retroflects to east toward the Banda Sea. A small flux exits \n\nIndonesian archipelago still in Flores sea through a small strait. The major flow keeps in \n\nroute within Banda Sea and goes out toward the Indian Ocean passing through both\n . \n\n\n\nEULERIAN ANALYSIS OF ITF 43 \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFIGURE 3.1 | Location of the ITF\u2019s region on the globe (top) and Mean Sea \nSurface Height (SSH) on the ITF colored by SSH, using output \ndata of Expt. 18.1 (see Section 2.1.1). The graphic shows the \nnames of sections used to estimate the transports. Karimata, \nMakassar and Moluccas correspond to the inflow pathway; and \nTimor, Ombai, Flores and Lombok to the outflow one.  \n\n \n\nFIGURE 3.2 | Horizontal Map of the flow in the mixed layer considering the average velocity \nfield for the ten last years of the Climatological Run. Makassar Passage is shown \nas the major inflow passageway for superficial flows. In this layer, water coming \nfrom Pacific are transported within Flores Sea toward Banda Sea, exiting from \nIndonesian archipelago to Indian Ocean basin by travelling throughout Lombok, \nFlores, Ombai and Timor straits. A smaller intense flow can be observed entering \nthe Indonesian seas by inflowing through Karimata strait. \n\n\n\nEULERIAN ANALYSIS OF ITF 44 \n \n\nsides of Timor island, crossing the Ombai strait and the Timor island\u2019s southern passage. \n\nAll the outflows converge in the Indian Ocean in a westward superficial flux with core \n\naround 11\u00b0S. Another relatively smaller inflow can be distinguished in the figures crossing \n\nthe Karimata strait southward, entering the Java Sea, which is shallower than Flores \n\nand Banda Seas (as it is represented in bathymetry of Fig. 3.3). Another weak flow, \n\nnorth of Australia, seems also to go into the Banda Sea. But the average field shows this \n\nsuperficial flux mixing with other  .superficial Banda\u2019s water forming a flow northward, \n\nexiting the Indonesian seas through Lifamatola passage. \n\nFig. 3.3 depicts the mean velocity field at 1000 m depth. At this depth, the \n\nLifamatola passage acts as a single inflow pathway with subthermocline waters entering \n\nthe Banda Sea through Lifamatola. The southward flow follows the topographic \n\nboundaries of different islands of the sea and eventually enters the Indian Ocean basin \n\nby outflowing through Ombai and Timor straits. In Fig. 3.3 it is also represented the \n \n\n \n \n\nFIGURE 3.3 | Horizontal Map of flow at 1000 m depth considering the average velocity field \nin the last ten years of the Climatological Run. The Lifamatola passage is the only \npathway for the inflow of deep water from Pacific Ocean into the Indonesian seas. \nA southward deep flow is formed in Banda Sea and its trajectory follows is affected \nby topographic boundaries which exist in the sea due to presence of small islands. \nLastly, these deep waters exit from the Indonesian archipelago toward the Indian \nOcean by outflowing through Ombai strait and Timor passage. The graph also \nmarks the 200 m (wider light blue line) and 1000 m (white) bathymetries. The \ngrey area is shallower than 1000 m. \n\n\n\nEULERIAN ANALYSIS OF ITF 45 \n \n\n200 m and 1000 m isobaths. Since the southern Banda Sea is shallower than the \n\nLifamatola sill (van Aken et al., 2009), this passageway controls the deep flow from the \n\nPacific to the Indian Ocean. \n \n \n\n3.2 VERTICAL PROFILES: \nCROSS-SECTION CURRENTS AND STRATIFICATION \u2013 EXPT. 18.1 \n\nThe output of the climatological run was also analyzed to study the vertical \n\nstructure of flows and waters physical properties represented by HYCOM. For that \n\npurpose, major sections have been analyzed: Makassar strait and the Lifamatola passage \n\nfor their importance on inflow pathways and the Ombai strait and Timor passage for \n\ncarrying both shallow and deep ITF outflow. \n\nFig. 3.4 shows vertical sections across two inflow passageways. In this figure, the mean \n\nvertical profiles, for the last ten years of the climatological run, the cross-section velocity, \n\nthe potential temperature and the salinity are plotted for Makassar strait and Lifamatola \n\npassage. Across Makassar, as it was expected, the flow is southward in the whole strait \n\nand occurs in the upper 800 m depth. Two cores appear to be distinguished: the first \n\none closer to surface, at ~ 100 m depth, with mean along-section speed greater than 1.0 \n\nm/s; and the other, below the thermocline, at approximately 500 m, showing a slower \n\nmaximum speeds ~ 0.2 m/s. \n\nThe vertical distribution of velocity in Lifamatola, however, is quite different. \n\nThe graphic in Fig. 3.4 shows two different regimes: one in the upper 450 m depth and \n\nother between 450 and 2000 m below the surface. In the shallower part, it shows, for \n\nthe western portion of the strait, an average surface northward flow, that reverses to \n\nsouthward, at ?100 m depth, and turns back to the north between ?200 m and ?450 m  \n \n\n\n\nEULERIAN ANALYSIS OF ITF 46 \n \n\n \n \n \n\nFIGURE 3.4 | Vertical Structure of major inflow passageway of ITF: Makassar strait (left) and Lifamatola \npassage (right). Current speed across the strait (meridional component) are showed in the graphs on top \nand Salinity and Potential Temperature stratification on bottom. Blue color intensities indicate a southward \nflow, while red ones denote a northward flow. In Makassar there is a continuous flux with two cores (above \nand below the thermocline) and it is not deeper than 800 m. In Lifamatola, HYCOM is representing an \nalternating direct flux, where the deep flux presents a core ?1100 m depth. The stratification patterns show \nLifamatola subthermocline waters slightly more saline than ones in Makassar. This suggests origins in North \nPacific for waters within Makassar and South Pacific for Lifamatola deep flow. \n\n \n\ndepth; but for the eastern portion, only a slower southward flow exists in the upper 200 \n\nm depth. Below 450 m depth, the flux is more intense, directed southward and extending \n\n\n\nEULERIAN ANALYSIS OF ITF 47 \n \n\nto the bottom, with the core at ?1100 m. \n\nThese results concerning the circulation in Lifamatola appear to disagree to \n\nanalyses obtained with INSTANT data. van Aken et al. (2009) observed a northward \n\nflow in the upper 1250 m depth, and the core of the deep southeastward current would \n\nbe closer to the bottom, at ?1900 m depth. However, there are two different approaches: \n\nhere, in order to represent the Lifamatola passage, a zonal section at 1.78\u00b0S has been \n\nchosen, and the vertical profile of the cross-section current is just the meridional \n\ncomponent of velocity; in (van Aken et al., 2009), authors used a different analysis, \n\nconsidering the effect of internal tides on the dynamic, thus, the vertical profile of the \n\nalong-section flow assumes a more realistic current\u2019s component. \n\nOn the other hand, this representation of HYCOM for the throughflow structure \n\nalong the Lifamatola seems to be closer to results achieved by Luick &amp; Cresswell (2001). \n\nAs in INSTANT analyses, authors also used data of a single mooring located in Maluku \n\nSea, and assuming a horizontally homogenous flow they found an average southward \n\ncurrent between 740 m and 1500 m below the surface along the whole Lifamatola \n\npassage, estimating a total transport of 7 Sv, very larger than the 2.5 Sv estimated by \n\nvan Aken et al. (2009). \n\nNevertheless, the temperature and salinity stratification agree to the previous \n\nwork for both inflow straits. In Lifamatola, a relatively more salinity water below the \n\nthermocline is observed, which corresponds to South Pacific subthermocline waters \n\ncarried into Indonesian Seas by the South Equatorial current (van Aken et al, 2009; \n\nMayer et al., 2010). Makassar inflow is mostly formed by North Pacific waters, coming \n\nfrom the North Equatorial current.\t\nThe same representation for Ombai strait and Timor passage is shown in  \n\nFig. 3.5. These are the outflow pathways where the deep waters from Lifamatola exit to \n\nthe Indian Ocean. For both straits, a westward mean flow is observed, with two distinct \n\ncores along the water column. The shallower transports waters inflowing through \n \n\n\n\nEULERIAN ANALYSIS OF ITF 48 \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\nFIGURE 3.5 | Vertical structure of Ombai strait (left) and Timor passage (right) showing the flow across \nthe straits (top) and the stratification profile (bottom).  Blue intensities denote westward velocities and \nred ones means eastward velocities crossing the section. In both straits, the flow presents two cores, one \nabove and other below thermocline, transporting waters which previously passed through Makassar and \nLifamatola, respectively. \n\n \n\nMakassar, at ~ 50 m depth (above thermocline). The other, at approximately 1000 m \n\ndepth in Ombai and 1100 m in Timor (below thermocline). In Timor, the deeper flow \n\n\n\nEULERIAN ANALYSIS OF ITF 49 \n \n\noccurs between 400 m and 1600 m depths. In Ombai strait the flow seems to extend \n\nfrom 400 m below the surface down to the bottom in the middle of strait\u2019s width. These \n\ndeeper cores are related to the deep water coming from Lifamatola. This agrees to direct \n\nestimates using INSTANT data (Sprintall et al., 2009). The stratification profiles show \n\na relatively lesser saline waters passing through both straits if compared to those within \n\nLifamatola. This is a good representation of the model concerning the role of ITF on \n\nchanging the Pacific inflow waters before putting them into the Indian basin.  \n \n \n\n3.3 VOLUME TRANSPORT IN THE UPPER 700 M \n\nTo quantify the volume transported by ITF in Expt. 18.1, the upper 700 m data \n\nwere considered. This depth allows to study variabilities related to air-sea interaction \n\nand anomalies that can be propagated under the thermocline.  \n\n3.3.1 Methodology \n\nThe volume transported by a geophysical flow crossing a vertical section, here \n\nalso referred as vertically (or depth-) integrated volume transport, is: \n\n KL = ? N ? O?Q  dRS  (8) \nwhere N is the velocity vector; T and U are, respectively, the eastward and northward \ncomponents of the velocity field; A is the surface delimited by the section; O?Q  is the \npointing vector normal to the surface A; 4 and 6 are the eastward and the northward \nposition components, respectively; and ? is the depth (see Appendix A). \n\nFor the meridional transport of volume across a vertical section along a fixed \n\nlatitude )V (as for Karimata, Makassar, Moluccas, Lombok and Flores straits), from the \nfree surface down to 700 m depth, using the grid discretization of the HYCOM GLBa0.08 \n\nand GLBu0.08, given by Eq. (2), (5), (6) and (7), the Eq. (8) can be written as (for \n\nlatitudes to the south of 47\u00b0N): \n\n\n\nEULERIAN ANALYSIS OF ITF 50 \n \n\n KLW(+, -()V), A)  =  ? ?

The \n\ntransport KLW is a scalar value, and it is positive for a northward flow and negative for \na southward flow. \n\nThe zonal transport of volume across a vertical section along a fixed longitude &amp;V (as considered for Ombai and Timor straits), from the surface down to 700 m depth, \nusing the grid discretization of HYCOM GLBa0.08 and GLBu0.08, given by Eq. (3), \n\n(5), (6) and (7), the Eq. (8) can be written as (for latitudes to the south of 47\u00b0N): \n\n KL\\(+(&amp;V), -, A)  =  ? ?

KL\\ is \npositive for an eastward flow, but negative for a westward flow.  \n\n3.3.2 Expt. 18.1 \u2013 Climatological Run \n\nIn the ITF region winds are strongly driven by a monsoon system, which forces \n\nseasonal variability of ITF. To illustrate the wind pattern along the climatological year \n\n\n\nEULERIAN ANALYSIS OF ITF 51 \n \n\nand the seasonal variability in the volume transport of the ITF, using data of the \n\nclimatological run and the wind field from NCEP data used as forcing, Fig. 3.6 shows \n\nmaps for each typical (climatologically averaged) month of the upper 700 m depth-\n\nintegrated transport per grid element area (in Sv/m2).

Values are shown for each single grid \npoint, where blue colors denote lower values of transport and red higher. Units are given in 10-9 Sv/m2 (in a 0.08\u00b0 \nhorizontal grid). Arrows represent the wind field. Name of the months are abbreviated in the bottom right corner \nof each map. The change in wind direction along the year is due to a monsoon pattern that drives winds in the \nITF region. As it can be seen in the Figure, this drives seasonal variability of the ITF transports, and consequently \nin the amount of waters exchange from Pacific to the Indian Ocean. \n\n\n\nEULERIAN ANALYSIS OF ITF 52 \n \n\nThe graphs reveal the change of wind directions over the climatological year and \n\nthe answer of the transport in the upper ocean in the spatial domain of ITF. Stronger \n\ntransports occur during the southeast monsoon, from June to September, when winds \n\nblow in the same direction of the outflow and in the opposite direction of the inflow path. \n\nOtherwise, during the northwest monsoon, the surface transport relaxes, the wind over \n\nthe IO blows in opposite direction of the outflow, but in the same direction of the inflow \n\nfluxes over the Indonesian seas. This strong seasonal variability has been also observed \n\nin INSTANT data (Sprintall et al., 2009). \n\nTo estimate the volume transported by ITF, cross-section fluxes in Karimata, \n\nMakassar and Moluccas straits were used to quantify the total inflow volume transported \n\nin the upper 700 m depth. Transports across Lombok, Flores, Ombai and Timor straits \n\ntogether give the total outflow. Fig. 3.7 shows the typical year (climatology-month \n\naveraged) for the Climatological Run the ITF\u2019s inflow and outflow volume transports in \n\nthe upper 700 m depth. \n \n \n \n \n\nIt can be seen the seasonal variability of the ITF and the reverse behavior of \n\noutflow vs inflow change along the year: while February is typically the month when \n\nthere is the lowest outflow transport (negative values), is also the highest mean value for  \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\nFIGURE 3.7 | Inflow (red) and outflow (black) volume transport in the upper 700 m depth for the \nClimatological Run.

The mean annual value for outflow transport has been estimated in \n\n12.3 Sv, and for the outflow, 13.2 Sv. The 0.9 Sv imbalance is proportional to the \n\nstandard deviation of values. \n\n3.3.3 Expt. 18.3 \u2013 Interannual Forcing Run \n\nOutflow and inflow transports are computed as the sum of the individual \n\ntransports across each strait that forms the respective pathway.

A base historical period is taken between 1970 and 1990,  \n\nand an additional period between 1991 and 2000 is also considered. For this middle \n\nperiod, a strong term increasing the transport of volume of ITF was found, specially \n\nbetween 1991 and 1995. A discussion about possible effects will be given in Section 3.4.2.  \n\nAs discussed in Introduction, the ITF is influenced by different modes of \n\nvariability, in different timescales. The ENSO is an important global climate variability \n\nmode that affects the ITF. To measure this relation, output data of the Interannual \n\nForcing Run was used to compute mean values of volume transport across all straits \n\nduring different ENSO events. \n\nTo assess the impact of ENSO, the monthly surface ITF transport across each \n\nof the three main inflow regions (Fig. 3.9) and the four main outflow straits (Fig. 3.10). \n\nThe graphics show the transports considering mean values in all years of the time series, \n\nmean values taken only during five El Ni\u00f1o events and five La Ni\u00f1a events. For El Ni\u00f1o, \n\nthe 1972/73 (strong), 1982/83 (very strong), 1991/92 (moderate), 1997/98 (very strong) \n\nand 2014/15 (very strong) events have been considered. And for La Ni\u00f1a, the 1973/74 \n\n(strong), 1975/76 (strong), 1988/89 (strong), 1999/2000 (moderate), and 2010/11 \n\n(moderate) have been also considered. \n\nFigs. 3.9 and 3.10 show, in a general line, that transports are larger during La \n\nNi\u00f1a and smaller during El Ni\u00f1o events. For the inflow straits, Moluccas shows larger \n\ntransport for both El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a. Previous work (van Sebille et al., 2014; Valsala \n\net al., 2011), have obtained comparable results, but reporting a smaller transport along \n\nMoluccas section during La Ni\u00f1a events, in an opposite behavior with Makassar. \n\nHowever, in this work only the superficial transports are being considered. In Makassar \n\nstrait the mean transport in all years is 12.4 Sv, for La Ni\u00f1a years is 13.5 Sv and only \n\n10.9 for El Ni\u00f1o ones. \n\nFor the outflow straits, as expected, a larger transport for La Ni\u00f1a events occurs \n\nin all straits. Lombok presents a mean transport value for all years of ~ 2.5 Sv, and it \n\n\n\nEULERIAN ANALYSIS OF ITF 55 \n \n\nincreases to 3.0 Sv for La Ni\u00f1a years and decrease to 2.0 for El Ni\u00f1o. In Timor, the \n\nvalues are 6.4 Sv (all years), 7.4 Sv (La Ni\u00f1a) and 5.5 (El Ni\u00f1o). In Ombai, 4.7 Sv (all \n\nyears), 5.4 Sv (La Ni\u00f1a) and 3.9 Sv (El Ni\u00f1o). \n\n \n\nFIGURE 3.9 | Monthly mean volume transport in the upper 700 m across the major three inflow straits, \nconsidering five different El Ni\u00f1o (green) and La Ni\u00f1a (blue) events, in comparison with the mean values \nfor all years (black line).

In addition, Table 3-1 also shows mean values of volume \n\ntransport across the same passages evaluated only during years when significant ENSO \n\nevents occurred; and, as expected, the volume of water changed from the Pacific Ocean \n\nto the Indian Ocean are in average smaller during an El Ni\u00f1o and expressively larger for \n\na year when a La Ni\u00f1a phase is being experienced. \n\n\n\nEULERIAN ANALYSIS OF ITF 58 \n \n\n3.3.4 Expt. 19.1 \u2013 HYCOM GLBu0.08 by NRL \n\nTo validate the output of the Expt. 19.1 with HYCOM, by NRL, in the interest \n\narea of this work, the map in the Fig. 3.14 shows the surface speed for a snapshot \n\nconsidering this run. \n\nThe transport of volume in the ITF outflow were also evaluated for the three \n\nlast years of the timeseries, and a mean value of 16 Sv for the vertically integrated \n\ntransport in the upper 700 m was found, in accordance with the results discussed in \n\nSections 3.4 and 3.5. \n\n \n\nFIGURE 3.11 | Transport of Volume vertically integrated in the upper 700 m for the ITF outflow straits, \nconsidering the last three years of the output data of the Expt. 19.1. the line in red is the linear adjustment \nof the curve and the grey dashed line is the mean value 16.01 \u00b1 8 Sv, close to the results showed in previous \nsections. \n\nA linear trend for the entire timeseries was of increasing 0.008 Sv/year.

O?Q  dRS  (15) \nwhere t is the density of water; uv is the specific heat at constant pressure; ?  is the \npotential temperature and ? x is the referential potential temperature evaluated at an \narbitrary section where the transport is zero for that flow. \n\nUsually, ? x ~ 3 ? is used for ITF, when the referential section is considered \nfrom the southern Australia to Antarctica. But, once this work is concerned about \n\nrelative values of transport between different years, for simplification, the referential \n\ntemperature will be considered as   ? x = 0.0 ? (16) \nFor the Indonesian Throughflow, the meridional (southward) transport of heat \n\nfor the upper 700 m across a vertical section of latitude )V = )V(6V)  will be (see \nAppendix A): \n\n sLW(4, 6V, ?)  = ? uv  ? ? t(4, 6V, ?) ?

Fig. 3.11 shows the time series \n\nfor the heat transport estimated as the sum of the heat transport across each outflow \n\nstrait. The mean value was estimated in 1.20 PW (1 PW = 1015 W), and a linear long-\n\nterm trend of increasing 0.005 PW/year. Interannual variabilities on the heat transport \n\nare also related to ENSO and IOD. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFIGURE 3.12 | ITF heat transport in the upper 700 m estimated across the outflow straits from 1970 to \n2015, smoothed every four months.

As for the volume transport, the ITF\u2019s heat transport \nalso presents a strong interannual and seasonal variability. MEAN total =  -1.20 PW | mean1 = -1.14 PW \n| trend1 = +0.004 PW/year | mean2 = -1.32 \u00b1 0.5 PW | trend2 = -0.01 PW/year | trend_green = -0.10 \nPW/year \n\nLee et al. (2015) showed that the abrupt increase in Indian Ocean heat content \n\nin recent years has an origin in anomalies within the Pacific Ocean. These anomalies \n\ncould be transported into the Indian Ocean via the ITF. For the same period considered \n\nby authors, which also has been observed the global warming hiatus phenomenon, we \n\nalso analyzed the ITF heat transport with HYCOM data. Considering the mean value of \n\n-1.2 PW, acquired in the whole time series, the anomaly on heat transport for the years \n\nbetween 2002 and 2012 were studied. Fig. 3.12 presents this curve. In this particular \n\nperiod, the increase in the heat transported from Pacific to Indian Ocean was much larger \n\nthan the small trend in the entire series. From 2002 to 2012, around 0.05 PW was added \n\nannually to the ITF heat transport in the upper 700 m. This result emphasizes that the \n\n\n\nEULERIAN ANALYSIS OF ITF 61 \n \n\nabrupt increase of the heat content within Indian Ocean has originated in Pacific Ocean \n\nand has been transported from a basin to other via the Indonesian Throughflow, since it \n\nalso shows an abrupt increase for the period on the outflow heat transport. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFIGURE 3.13 | ITF\u2019s heat transport anomaly from 2002 to 2012, bi-monthly smoothed. The anomaly was \ncalculated considering the mean value for the entire time series, and the transports are estimated across \nthe outflow straits. Envelopes are the standard errors. Red line is the fit linear of the points plotted. A \nlarge linear increasing trend of the ITF\u2019s heat transport was observed at this period. \n\n \n\nHowever, this behavior is not verified for the last years of the time series of the \n\nmodel run. In fact, 2014/2015 were years related to a very strong El Ni\u00f1o event, and in \n\nsuch situation, a smaller value for the transport across the ITF should be expected. Fig. \n\n3.13 shows the ITF heat transport anomaly from June/2013 to December/2015, and in \n\nthe same graph is also plotted the Nino3.4 Index anomaly, as provided from the NOAA \n\ndataset (Rayner, 2003). Both curves variate in a similar way for these years: as the \n\nNino3.4 increase, the ITF heat transport decrease (negative values). This represents a \n\nstrong response of the ITF to the 2014/15 and 2015/16 El Ni\u00f1o events, and suggests \n\npossible relations with current anomalies on the heat content within the Indo-Pacific \n\nOcean and possibly with climate change. \n\nTable 3-2 shows the mean values of the heat transport by ITF over 4 different \n\nperiods and their respective linear trends. Revealing, as the graph of Fig. 3.13, that ITF \n\nis becoming stronger since the beginning of the 1990\u2019s decade.

From the surface to the sea floor of this line, there is the transit of many \n\nwater masses of great importance to the global circulation (including cores of the North \n\nAtlantic Deep Water and of the Antarctic Bottom Water). Also, important currents \n\ncross that line: in the upper layers, for example, the Agulhas leakage can be found on \n\nthe east portion of the line and the Brazil Current on the west, part of the South Atlantic \n\nSubtropical Gyre. \n\nOutput data from the Expt. 18.3 (Interannual Forcing Run \u2013 HYCOM \n\nGLBa0.08 by LABMON) and the Expt. 19.1 (HYCOM GLBu0.08 by NRL) were used \n\nfor a set of Lagrangian Analyses employing PARCELS and CMS algorithms, and were \n\nlabeled as: PAR_18.3mix; CMS_18.3 and CMS_19.1. \n\nThe Lagrangian description of the geophysical fluids is based on tracking every \n\n\n\nLAGRANGIAN ANALYSIS 64 \n \n\nmacroscopic particle of the fluid and follow their trajectories (see Appendix B). The \n\nstudy of the movement of particles in complex flows, the case for the Earth\u2019s ocean and \n\natmosphere, should consider chaotic motion, that is found even for the simplest fields of \n\nvelocity for the geophysical fluids. The result of a Lagrangian analysis based on data \n\nfrom Eulerian fields for a discrete treatment, i.e., not considering every single particle of \n\nthe fluid, will be a probabilistic distribution that represents the chance of some variable, \n\nparticle, or property of the fluid being observed at that instant and position. \n\n4.1 METHODOLOGY \n\nTo study correlations between the South Atlantic Circulation and the Indonesian \n\nThroughflow, virtual Lagrangian particles have been tracked from the present days to \n\nthe past, i.e.: an initial ensemble of particles is virtually released at the SAMBA line at \n\nevery time interval. The Eulerian velocity fields are inverted and the particles are \n\nadvected using the 4th order Runge-Kutta numerical integrator for a timestep of 6 hours, \n\ncomputing the trajectories in a backward recovered motion. This approach aims to \n\nanswer the question \u201cwhere did those particles come from?\u201d, i.e., the main objective is \n\nto evaluate the sources of the composition of the waters in the South Atlantic for the \n\npresent days. Output data of the simulations is given every 24 hours.  \n\nTrying to represent chaotic transports, effects of molecular and turbulent \n\ndiffusion and physical processes weakly or not represented in models\u2019 outputs, both \n\nLagrangian algorithms descripted in Chapter 2 (CMS and PARCELS) bring, as usually \n\nis done, numerical modules of stochastic parametrizations that mix stochastic \n\ncomponents to the deterministic advection terms. However, depending on the spatial and \n\ntime resolutions available for the Eulerian fields provided by the OGCM, and on the \n\nprocesses supposedly not solved by the model and that one wishes to represent, adding \n\nstochastic terms can be unnecessary or not efficient at all, besides bringing an additional \n\ncomputing effort. That can be especially true in the case there is sufficient resolution and \n\n\n\nLAGRANGIAN ANALYSIS 65 \n \n\nproper representation of the mesoscale processes (Koszalka et al., 2013; Sebille et al., \n\n2018). \n\nHaving in mind such aspects related to the HYCOM runs whose this work has \n\nutilized, no stochastic noise were added to the advection for the Lagrangian experiments \n\nthat will be studied in this Chapter, for both CMS and PARCELS, once the GLBa0.08 \n\nimplementation of HYCOM was based on resolving mesoscale eddies. Additional \n\nconsiderations about the chaotic behavior of the interoceanic exchange are beyond the \n\npurposes of this work. \n\n4.2 PAR_18.3MIX \n\nThis experiment utilizes the PARCELS algorithm as the numerical tool for \n\nLagrangian Analysis. However, as yet not fully operational, PARCELS holds some \n\nlimitations, as not dealing with particles too close to the coast, and only works at 1 \n\nprocessor at each time. \n\nOutput data of Expt. 18.3 were used to input the Eulerian fields of the barotropic \n\nvelocity and the temperature of the mixed layer, from 2015 backward to 1990. Particles \n\nwere released on the surface at 34.5\u00b0S (0 m depth) every month from 2015 to 2010 and \n\nhorizontally advected, simulating surface drifters. The temperature is interpolated by the \n\ncode along the computed trajectory. If the particle travels beyond the spatial limit of \n\ninterest, it is then excluded from that time instant of simulation. The map with all \n\ntrajectories for the entire simulation time is given in Fig. 4.1. Blue colors denote lower \n\nwater temperature, and the red ones warmer waters. Some patterns of the surface \n\ncirculation can be inferred from Fig. 4.1: Subtropical gyres of the South Atlantic and \n\nIndian Ocean; the ITF (very weak though) coming from the east; the temperature \n\ndifference between the Benguela Current (pink color to the southwest of Africa) \u2013 \n\nmatching a cold water current \u2013 and the Brazil Current \u2013 represented by the warmer \n\ntrajectories as a western boundary current; the region of Brazil-Malvinas Confluence  \n \n\n\n\nLAGRANGIAN ANALYSIS 66 \n \n\n \n\nFIGURE 4.1 | Conjunct of all trajectories of simulation PAR_18.3mix, between 1990 and 2015. Colors indicate \nthe temperature at each trajectory position, in \u00b0C. \n\nbetween 35\u00b0C and 50\u00b0S, with some portion of the Malvinas Current flowing northward \n\ninto the Brazilian coast; and the South Atlantic Current, carrying cooler waters to the \n\neast. \n\nFor a probabilistic approach, it is common to analyze the set of trajectories \n\nthrough the frequency of visits in binned grid. A grid of reasonable size must be scaled \n\nin terms of the time resolution with which the trajectories\u2019 data are written and must be \n\nlarge enough so that all the trajectory points that pass through a grid cell in the \n\nsimulation time are computed. \n\nThe result is a probability distribution map as seen in Fig. 4.2. For that map, \n\nthe colors represent the probability to find any particle at an arbitrary time of the entire \n\nsimulation time considered for the PAR_18.3mix, within a 1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0 horizontally spaced \ncell. This map is, above all, a correlation profile: since all the initial conditions starts \n\nalong the line 34.5\u00b0S (shown as the white dashed line in Fig. 4.2), it is expected that the \n\ngrid cells close to that region are more likely to host some particle for the observation \n\ntime of all trajectories. \n\nHowever, one needs to be in mind that all the Lagrangian analyses that is shown \n\nin this chapter were computed with a negative timestep, that is, from the present to the  \n \n\n\n\nLAGRANGIAN ANALYSIS 67 \n \n\n \n\nFIGURE 4.2 | Probability to observe a particle in a 1\u00b0 X 1\u00b0 horizontal binned grid at the sea surface, considering \nthe simulation time for all trajectories, according to the analysis PAR_18.3mix. The white line shows the SAMBA \nline, the initial position on which particles were released. \n\npast, which investigates the origin of the water parcels present in the initial condition \n\nregion at the initial time. Therefore, the correlation that must be done is that the colors \n\nalso represent a greater or lesser probability of each binned cell being responsible for a \n\ndifferent source of water bodies present in the vicinity of the surface of the SAMBA line \n\nfrom 2010 to 2015 of initial conditions). \n\nAnother point to note is that darker colors, which denote higher probability of \n\nobservation by grid cell, do not necessarily denote a more intense circulation pattern. \n\nInstead, the high frequency of observations may mean recirculation of particles. This \n\nphenomenon is highlighted in black and lilac in the South Atlantic, which, although \n\ndistant from the region of initial condition to the northwest and southwest, coincide with \n\nthe contour of the subtropical gyration, where, especially for the South Atlantic is a \n\nregion of accumulation of (eg McAdam &amp; Sebille, 2018), which in the oceans are floats \n\nthat spread on the surface in a manner similar to the dynamics considered in the \n\nPAR_18.3mix simulation. \n\nAmong the central objectives of the present work is the correlation study \n\nbetween the ITF and the LA, and the developed Lagrangian analyses were designed and \n\nconceived for this purpose. However, as shown in Fig. 4.3, the PAR_18.3mix simulation \n\ndid not provide enough data for such analysis: of all computed trajectories, only three \n\nwere those that connected the two systems for the analyzed period. This result, however,  \n\n\n\nLAGRANGIAN ANALYSIS 68 \n \n\n \n\n \nFIGURE 4.3 | Conjunct of trajectories connecting ITF and AL, according to simulation PAR_18.3mix, \ncorresponding to only 3 trajectories (or 0.05%) of the whole 5912 initial conditions computed. \n\nis not an abnormal not expected result, because surface floats are subject to dynamic \n\nprocesses that rather depend on the superficial pressure oscillation and atmospheric \n\nevents, causing the particles to be confined for long periods in the subtropical turns, \n\nnecessitating longer displacement so that connections between ocean basins can be \n\nverified. Also, the purely horizontal surface movement may not be enough to represent \n\nthe movement in the open ocean (predominantly baroclinic), when it is desired to study \n\nprocesses that depend, among other factors, on vertical flows, as in the case of ITF. \n \n\n4.3 CMS_18.3 \n\nThis experiment considers the CMS as a numerical model for trajectory \n\nsimulation. Virtual particles were released once monthly during the year 2015, along the \n\nSAMBA line and between 0 and 1000 m depth. As the CMS does not interpolate the \n\ninitial values of the particles, the values for the depth are the same made available in \n\nthe HYCOM output files, where some of the 33 vertical levels in meters were considered: \n\n{0, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000}. \n\nAs the systems under study (ITF and AL) occur essentially on the surface and \n\n\n\nLAGRANGIAN ANALYSIS 69 \n \n\nsubsurface of the oceans, depths up to 1000 m are sufficient for this study. In addition, \n\nas we have shown in previous reports, results with Expt. 18.3 in the ITF does not seem \n\nto represent with fidelity the deeper regions. As a cause of this, in other factors, there \n\nmay be the \u201cwarm up\u201d time of the model: the deep ocean requires hundreds of years to \n\nadjust; but for the upper ocean that is just about 50 years (Kantha &amp; Clayson, 2000). \n\nWe consider as input values for the velocity fields in the CMS the results of Expt \n\n18.3 with HYCOM. Outputs are provided with mean values computed every 6 days, \n\ncomprising the zonal, meridional and vertical components of the total velocity, that is, \n\nas HYCOM associates for data output purposes the vertical coordinate with density \n\nlevels, grid to which the CMS does not support, the speed computed in the orthogonal \n\ngrid linearly interpolated and smoothed, and later interpolated once more by the CMS, \n\nconsiders not only the baroclinic component of the velocity in the original grid point of \n\nthe model, but the total component taking possible rotations of adjust to the orthogonal \n\ngrid at z-levels.  \n\nThe simulation is for the period between 1994 and 2015. The particles are also \n\nadvected using Runge-Kutta of 4th order, in the 3 spatial dimensions and in the time \n\nwith negative integration step also of 6h. Results are written every 1 day. \n\nThis simulation brings relevant data regarding the vertical dynamics of the \n\nmovement, considering three-dimensional velocity fields, available from the surface to \n\nthe ocean floor, for the entire analyzed region. Fig. 4.4 shows the complete set of \n\ntrajectories obtained, indicating in red the initial condition points on the line 34.5\u00b0S, \n\nand, in blue tones, the different depths at which the particles were observed. Although \n\nthe largest depth provided as the initial condition was 1000 m, the input data contained \n\nvalues for the entire water column, including values for the vertical velocity component, \n\nwhich allowed the particles to move to shallower or deeper regions. \n\nAs discussed in the previous section, Fig. 4.5 shows the probability distribution \n\nby grid cell, in this case also 1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0 horizontally spaced and vertically extended from  \n \n\n\n\nLAGRANGIAN ANALYSIS 70 \n \n\n \n\nFIGURE 4.4 | Conjuct of all trajectories computed by simulation CMS_18.3 (1994 \u2013 2015).

The same correlation analysis can be done: the color scale denotes a \n\nstronger or weaker probability that each grid cell was a location from which the waters \n\nthat were present between the surface and 1000 m depth along the SAMBA line in the \n\nyear of 2015: the year in which the particles were \"collected\" monthly, that is, strictly, \n\nconsidering the integration of the present into the past, the particles are not \"released\", \n\nbut collected in the position and instant of initial condition (which is in the final condition \n\n\n\nLAGRANGIAN ANALYSIS 71 \n \n\nof the movement). \n\nIn addition to the circulation patterns quoted for the simulation with the surface \n\nfloats of the previous section, the maps of Figs. 4.4 and 4.5 show flow through the \n\nIndonesian straits more intense, with depths varying in ~10 m below the surface. It can \n\nalso be seen a flow through the south of Australia, bringing waters of the South Pacific \n\nthat mix with the subtropical turn of the Indian Ocean: that is the Tasmania Leak \n\n(Speich et al., 2002), less intense than ITF, and with less contribution to the formation \n\nof waters in the South Atlantic (given the color scale \u2013 represented in pink \u2013, compared \n\nto the ITF blue in the Indian Ocean). \n\nAgain, in order to study connections with the ITF and Circulation in the South \n\nAtlantic, the map in Fig. 4.6 shows the overlap of all trajectories connecting the ITF to \n\nthe Agulhas Leak region, that is: once the initial conditions are given in the South \n\nAtlantic, on the SAMBA line, any trajectory observed in the North Pacific region (north \n\nof Australia on the map) must connect the two systems. It is possible to note aspects of \n\nthe pathway descripted by the trajectories, which are maintained in the subtropical gyres, \n\nmerging with the circulation of the Indian basin before finally being distributed in the \n\nSouth Atlantic, with variable depths. \n\nFig. 4.7 shows the same map in terms of probabilities in a horizontal grid. When \n\none considers only the trajectories that certainly connect the South Atlantic to the \n\nPacific, the probability of finding a particle in the Atlantic is smaller when compared to \n\nthe set of particles. Considering the integration of position of the particles being \n\nperformed from the present to the past, then the particles must, for these trajectories, \n\nreturn to the Pacific. Likewise, the probabilities in the Indian Ocean are higher when \n\ncompared to the total set of particles, since for the trajectories that connect the ITF to \n\nthe LA, they must pass through the Indian Ocean. Darker points from the region south-\n\neast of Africa to the coast of Indonesia trace the most likely places to find a particle. \n\nAlso, one can see the decrease of the Tasmania Leak, which has little correlation  \n.\n\n\n\nLAGRANGIAN ANALYSIS 72 \n \n\n \nFIGURE 4.6 | Conjunct of trajectories connecting ITF and AL (6.45% of the whole ensemble), considering the \nsimulation CMS_18.3 (1994 \u2013 2015) \n\n \n\nFIGURE 4.7 | Probability to observe a particle in a 1\u00b0 X 1\u00b0 horizontally spaced grid expanded from the surface \nto the bottom, considering only the trajectories the connect the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, for the complete \ntime of simulation of the analysis CMS_18.3 \n\nwith these specific trajectories. \n\nAn area of high probability density is revealed in Fig. 4.7 for the Agulhas Leak \n\nregion, since all the particles (once sown in the South Atlantic) must pass through, to \n\nhave come from the North Pacific Ocean. In addition, the recirculation of these particles \n\naround this region, traveling with the anticyclonic vortices, the so-called \u201crings\u201d of the \n\nAgulhas, make it a likely region of observation. \n\nAn aspect that must be studied for the simulation CMS_18.3 is the vertical \n\n\n\nLAGRANGIAN ANALYSIS 73 \n \n\nstructure of the trajectories, since it is the only experiment that considers the vertical \n\nmovement of the particles. If there were no vertical movement, the mean value of the \n\ndepth of the set of trajectories should remain constant and equal to the initial condition. \n\nBut it is not what runs him. Figure 4.8 illustrates this behavior, showing a variation of \n\n100 m in the mean depth over time, if only the trajectories linking the three ocean basins \n\nare considered. \n\nFor the open ocean, far from the boundaries and the surface, one can expect a \n\nbaroclinic behavior, and three-dimensional flows traveling on surfaces of constant density \n\n(isopicnals), which usually are not parallel to the surface, leading to changes in the depth \n\nof each particle, and changing the ensemble's average pattern over the time. \n\nMoreover, the histogram of Fig. 4.9 shows that there are among the trajectories \n\nthat connect the Needle and ITF Systems a predilection for greater depths when \n\ncompared to the set with all trajectories: it is more likely to observe the entire set of \n\ntrajectories between 0 and 150 m depth, between the trajectories that connect the two \n\nsystems, the probability is greater between 50 and 200 m depth. \n\n \n\nFIGURE 4.8 | Evolution of the mean depth of the conjunct of trajectories connecting ITF and AL, over the \ntime of simulation of CMS_18.3 \n\nFurthermore, Fig. 4.10 shows that when we consider only trajectories in which \n\nthe depth remained above 100 m for the entire period, only two of these trajectories are \n\nthose that cross the Indian Ocean and link the ITF to the South Atlantic. \n\n\n\nLAGRANGIAN ANALYSIS 74 \n \n\n \n\nFIGURE 4.9 | Probability to observe a particle at different depths, over the simulation time of CMS_18.3, \nconsidering the complete conjunct of trajectories (grey) and the conjunct of trajectories connecting ITF and AL \n(red). \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFIGURE 4.10 | Conjunct of trajectories that have kept themselves in the upper 100 m of depth during the \nentire time of simulation \n\n\n\nLAGRANGIAN ANALYSIS 75 \n \n\n \n\nFIGURE 4.11 | Average behavior of the conjunct of trajectories connecting ITF and AL: colors represent the \nmean depth of the whole ensemble, being closer to the surface when traveling over in the Indian Ocean basin, \nconsidering the simulation CMS_18.3. \n\nAnd if we consider a mean fictitious trajectory, considering the average of the \n\nhorizontal and vertical positions of the trajectories that connect ITF and AL, we see the \n\nbehavior which is shown in Fig. 4.11, where mean shallower depths of 100 m are revealed \n\nduring the average trajectory trajectory within the Indian Ocean basin when compared \n\nto the mean depths in the horizontal positions corresponding to the South Atlantic and \n\nNorth Pacific Oceans. \n\nAn analysis of the simulation time, counted as days before the initial conditions \n\n(given in the course of the year 2015), that each trajectory takes to actually be observed \n\nin the Pacific, passing through the ITF, shows in Fig. 4.12 that the highest probability \n\nis that the trajectories are only observed in the ITF region at the end of the simulation \n\ntime series between 5500 and 7800 days (15-20 years). This means that the trajectories \n\nremain most of the simulation time confined, first, to the subtropical South Atlantic swirl \n\nand then to the Indian basin before finally being found in the Indonesian region. A time \n\nof 10 to 30 years was also found by Durgadoo et al. (2017) so that ITF waters left the \n\nIndian Ocean basin through the Agulhas Leakage in a similar Lagrangian analysis. This \n\nresult and those of Figs. 4.10 and 4.11 are in accordance with the graph of Fig. 4.8, which \n\n\n\nLAGRANGIAN ANALYSIS 76 \n \n\nshows: greater depths for short simulation times, what means they are closer to the initial \n\nconditions \u2013 (Atlantic basin); smaller depths for average times - Indian Ocean; and, then \n\nagain, larger depths for the final simulation times: ITF region and North Pacific Ocean. \n\nThis means that although the flow through the ITF is primarily superficial, \n\ndynamic processes in subsurface directly influence the system and model the \n\ncharacteristics of the masses of water that will be transported from one basin to another. \n\nA more precise analysis for this hypothesis would be to consider the interpolation of \n\nparameters such as density, temperature and salinity of the particles along the trajectory. \n\nAlthough CMS was designed to perform this activity, none of the temperature data we \n\nprovided in all experiments with the CMS were correctly interpolated, returning values \n\nclose to zero for the entire geographic distribution. \n\n \n \n\n. \n\n \n\nFIGURE 4.12 | Probability of transient time observed for the pathway between the SAMBA line and the ITF \nSystem, considering the conjunct of trajectories that connect both regions in the simulation CMS_18.3 \n\n4.4 CMS_19.1 \n\nThe initial conditions of this simulation are as close as possible to the simulation \n\nCMS_18.3. But, in this case, particles were released every month in the course of the \n\nyear 2012, on the line 34.5\u00b0S, with some difference in the initial depths, as described in \n\n\n\nLAGRANGIAN ANALYSIS 77 \n \n\nEq. (7): {0, 4, 0, 25, 25, 50, 70, 100, 125, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, \n\n900, 1000}. \n\nAlthough the temporal resolution of data availability for velocity fields is greater, \n\nwe maintained the integration step in 6h and results written in 1-day frequencies for \n\ncomparison purposes. The Expt. 19.1 does not provide prediction for the vertical \n\ncomponent z of the velocity. So, even if we consider initial conditions at different depths, \nthe CMS integrates a purely horizontal displacement keeping the depth constant. In the \n\nopen ocean, predominantly baroclinic, such an analysis may not be adequate. \n\nThis simulation evaluated the movement of particles between the surface and \n\n1000 m depth, considering the largest time series continuously available for Expt. 19.1 \n\nwith HYCOM GLBu0.08, which goes from November 28, 1996 to December 31, 2012. \n\nData prior to November 1996 are not complete and have not been used. \n\nAs the data in Expt. 19.1 do not bring values for the vertical component of the \n\nvelocity field, and we did not consider stochastic terms of vertical diffusivity, the particles \n\nare advected horizontally and remain at the same depth for the entire simulation period. \n\nFig. 4.13 shows the overlap of all trajectories obtained. \n\nAlthough it has a total of 5 years less than the time considered in the CMS_18.3 \n\nexperiment, the maps of Figs. 4.4 and 4.13 can be compared. Like those in Figs. 4.5 and \n\n4.14. In the Atlantic basin of the map it is possible to note a meridional transport of \n\nparticles, where is shown the northern portion of the Atlantic Ocean present on the map \n\nmuch less dense in the CMS_19.1 simulation than in the CMS_18.3. In the Indian, the \n\nsame can be observed, with the trajectories concentrated below the equatorial line, \n\nmaking in general the trajectories for the simulation CMS_19.1 are mostly confined to \n\nthe subtropical region. In the small portion of the North Pacific that is presented in the \n\nextreme northeast of the maps, Figs. 4.13 and 4.14 show a flow of particles moving in \n\nthe South China Sea and Gulf of Thailand (marked in red in Figures 4.13 and 4.14) \n\nwhich are not verified in the maps of Figs. 4.4 and 4.5. These flows converge to the ITF  \n \n\n\n\nLAGRANGIAN ANALYSIS 78 \n \n\n \n\nFIGURE 4.13 | Conjunct of all trajectories computed by simulation CMS_19.1 (1997 \u2013 2012).

An analysis like the CMS_19.1, for which the OGCM velocity \n\nfields do not allow such vertical flows, and where we did not impose stochastic terms on \n\nthe Lagrangian code that could simulate vertical displacements (via diapycnal diffusion, \n\nfor example), it is probable that the trajectories are not conveniently representing the \n\nprediction that the outputs of the HYCOM GLBu0.08 model from Expt 19.1 are in fact \n\nproviding. \n\nStill qualitatively, Figs. 4.6 and 4.7 can be compared to the maps of Figs. 4.15 \n\nand 4.16 and show, respectively, the overlap of the set of all the trajectories that connect \n\nthe ITF to the South Atlantic and the probability distribution per grid cell to observe a \n\nparticle belonging to this set at any time in the simulation period . With noticeable \n\ndifference from the results of the CMS_18.3 simulation, Figs. 4.15 and 4.16 show \n\ntrajectories connecting the three ocean basins through flows that, as already mentioned, \n\npass to the northwest of the island of Brunei, coming from the South China Sea with \n\ngreat recirculation and probabilities of observations (marked in red in Fig. in contrast to \n\nthe flows across the Makassar Strait that should be most likely (marked on the yellow \n\narrow). The waters leave the ITF by straits that are not representative for the flow, such \n\nas the Singapore Strait, and a small shallow passage to the west of Jakarta. In the Indian \n\nOcean, trajectories weakly join the subtropical gyre, but rather, similar to a meandering \n\nzonal flow, propagate westward to the east coast of the African continent, and rapidly \n\njoin the Agulhas System, which transmits all trajectories to the South Atlantic, without \n\nrepresenting the retroflexion of the Agulhas Current, which could take the particles back \n\nto the Indian Ocean circulation, merging the particles back to the subtropical gyre of \n\nthis basin. \n\nFig. 4.17 shows a plot of the probability distribution of the average depth of the \n\ntrajectories, considering the complete set of Lagrangian particles and only the set of \n\ntrajectories that connect ITF and AL. The distributions of the histogram occur in peaks \n\nof values, since the depth of each particle remains constant throughout the movement. \n\n\n\nLAGRANGIAN ANALYSIS 80 \n \n\n \n\nFIGURE 4.15 | Conjunct of trajectories connecting ITF and AL (5.22% of the whole ensemble), considering \nthe simulation CMS_19.1 (1997 \u2013 2012) \n\n \n\nFIGURE 4.16 | Probability to find a particle in a 1\u00b0 X 1\u00b0 spaced horizontal grid cell, expanded from surface to \n1000 m of depth, considering the analysis CMS_19.1, for the trajectories connecting the Pacific Ocean and the \nSouth Atlantic Ocean for the whole time of the simulation CMS_19.1. \n\nUnlike the graph shown in Fig. 4.9, where there was a preference for regions of \n\ngreater depth for the connection trajectories in relation to the whole ensemble, in this \n\nsimulation CMS_19.1 the particles collected in the South Atlantic and that certainly \n\ncame from the ITF moved preferentially in more superficial regions when compared to \n\nthe set of all the trajectories considered. \n\nThis is another indication of the inadequate representation of three-dimensional \n\nflows without considering the vertical displacements that are part of the dynamics of  \n \n\n\n\nLAGRANGIAN ANALYSIS 81 \n \n\n \nFIGURE 4.17 | Probability to observe a particle at different depths, over the time of simulation for the \nexperiment CMS_19.1, considering all trajectories (green) and the trajectories connecting ITF and AL (blue) \n\nwater mass transformations that are known to be part of the circulation systems and \n\npatterns studied here. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 | CONCLUSION \n\nAn implementation of HYCOM in a global, eddy-resolving resolution experiment \n\nwas used to study the Indonesian Throughflow. Output data of the run forced with \n\nclimatology of atmospheric data have been utilized to study the ITF structure, mean \n\npaths for horizontal flow and seasonal variability. The fluxes on surface and the mean \n\npath of inflow and outflow are represented satisfactorily. However, the deep flow in \n\nLifamatola passage is not in accordance to the INSTANT data. \n\nThe ITF volume transport has been estimated for surface flows, in the upper \n\n700 m depth. Results have shown the seasonal ITF variability is mostly driven by the \n\nmonsoon winds system that acts on the region. A maximum flow is observed when winds \n\nblow in the same direction of the ITF superficial outflow path, between June to \n\nSeptember. The values of volume transport estimated for the surface are in accordance \n\nwith INSTANT data and other works. \n\nUsing the output data of the run forced with atmospheric fields varying on years, \n\nit was possible to study the interannual variability of the ITF. A response to ENSO \n\nevents is being well represented by the model. El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events cause the ITF \n\ntransport decrease and increase, respectively. Analyzing each ITF\u2019s strait individually, \n\nwas also possible to verify the response of each region. \n\nThe ITF heat transport has been estimated in the upper 700 m depth. Both \n\nvolume and heat transports present a small trend of increase, in the whole time series, \n\nbut it seems not to be related to real changes in the system. \n\nAnomalies in the heat transport for three different periods of the time series have \n\nbeen studied in order to understand the representation of HYCOM concerning the abrupt \n\n\n\nCONCLUSION 83 \n \n\nincrease of heat content within the Indian Ocean during the global surface warming \n\nslowdown. Between 2001 and 2012 the simulation with HYCOM shows a strong change \n\nin the surface heat transport of the ITF, increasing the amount of energy carried from \n\nthe Pacific to the Indian Ocean in the same period. This could help explaining changes \n\nin the heat content within the Indian Ocean and also corroborate the hypothesis that \n\ncorrelates the phenomenon with the global warming hiatus. \n\nHowever, another period, between 1991 and 1995 revealed that the ITF is getting \n\nstronger one decade earlier than the beginning of the hiatus, and other events could be \n\ncorrelated for that, like the Pinatubo volcanic eruption that happened in 1991. The fact \n\nis that the Indian Ocean is being more active than in the past and its connection with \n\nthe Pacific Ocean is becoming weaker. \n\nIn addition, the analysis of the ITF heat transport in the last three years of the \n\nexperiment shows a strong correlation to Nino3.4 Index and an evident response to El \n\nNi\u00f1o event, where the increase before observed in the ITF heat transport now is \n\nconverted in a hard decrease. Further analysis should be considered concerning the state \n\nof Indian Ocean\u2019s heat content after 2012, and the ITF for beyond the year 2015. \n\nThe experiments with HYCOM demonstrate good representation concerning the \n\nITF structure and its variability. Once it has been used a global implementation, other \n\nsystems can be studied in order to find further correlations. A global eddy-resolving \n\nresolution can permit, for example, to analyze the coherence of the ITF with Agulhas \n\nleakage and a better understood of the global MOC and its importance in the global \n\nclimate system and in the recent climate changes. \n\nNumerical experiments of Lagrangian analyses for the flow represented by \n\ndifferent runs of the OGCM. The goal of this additional effort was to establish a \n\nnumerical tool that could be used in future studies that consider output of forced ocean \n\nmodels and of coupled ocean-atmosphere models, looking for contributions concerning \n\nthe ITF and the AL circulation patterns, net transports, and their variability in different \n\n\n\nCONCLUSION 84 \n \n\ntimescales. \n\nThe outputs of 2 different runs were used to carry out the main investigation of \n\nthe ITF variabilities and to force different test-experiments simulating the backward \n\nmotion of virtual Lagrangian particles from the South Atlantic Ocean. Then, the \n\ncomputed pathways can be used to describe qualitative and quantitatively the flow \n\nparcels connecting ITF to the South Atlantic Ocean, carried by the Agulhas rings and \n\nthe Indian Ocean circulation. \n\n \n\n5.1 SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE WORK \n\nUntil now, the experiments performed using CMS and PARCELS allowed us to \n\na fully understanding the methodology once proposed. \n\nThat allows to evaluate volume and heat transport through the ITF and the \n\nAgulhas Leakage using the Lagrangian data that will be compared with transports \n\nevaluated in the Eulerian frame. \n\nAs a natural continuation of the present work, it is suggested that an evaluation \n\nof changes and variability of the ocean heat budget in the Indian Ocean and in the South \n\nAtlantic Ocean be performed in the global warming hiatus period, considering possible \n\ncorrelations with the ITF and the Agulhas Leakage. \nChanges and variability of water masses exchange can be computed. Eulerian \n\nfields from a coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model could help to establish correlations \n\nwith these changes by tracking the flow, the forcing winds and climate events associated. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nAPPENDIX A \nGEOGRAPHIC COORDINATE SYSTEMS \n\nIn this work, two coordinate systems have been referred and used, for example, \n\nin the estimates of transports.

(A-5) \nwhere: \n\n\u00e0 78 = 6.371 \u00d7 106 m (A-6) \n is the mean radius of the Earth considered approximately spherical; \n\n\u00e0 4 is the eastward arc length related to the angle &amp; measured from latitude ), [4] = m; \n\u00e0 6 is the northward arc length related to the angle ), [6] = m; \n\u00e0 ? is the depth, measured vertically downward from the Earth\u2019s surface; [?] = m. \n\nThe unit vectors are related to each other system as:   l? = |? ;  m? = } ?;  ? ? = ? ~? (A-7) \nThe system of coordinates (4, 6, ?) is usually called quasi-Cartesian, and an \n\nelement of volume in space can be simply described for these coordinates as: \n\n 5V =  54 56 5? ?  [?3] (A-8) \nIf 5 ? 0, then:  d4 = 78 9180\u00b0 cos ) d&amp; (A-9)  dV = d4 d6 d?  ?      d6 = 78 9180\u00b0 d) (A-10)  d? = d? (A-11) \nwhere dx and dy are infinitesimal line elements of the arc lengths in the eastward and \n\nthe northward directions, respectively, while dz is an infinitesimal downward distance. \n\nIf instead of continuous, the geographical space was discretized into + \u00d7 - \u00d7 A \nfixed-points located at  {'(@ = (&amp;'(, )'(, ? ?@), (A-12) \nwhere i,j are indices of a horizontal grid and k of a vertical grid in which those points \n\nwere placed, then  ?'(@ = 4'(l? + 6'(m? + ?@? ?

(A-18) \n \n\n \n\n   \n\n\n\n \n\nAPPENDIX B \nEULERIAN AND LAGRANGIAN REPRESENTATIONS OF \nTHE GEOPHYSICAL FLUID FLOWS \n\nThe Newton\u2019s Second Law of motion stablishes that the net force acting over a \n\nmoving particle is the responsible for the time variation of the particle\u2019s linear \n\nmomentum, in other words:  ? ?? ? = ddF (?N) = ? d2?dF2 + d?dF d?dF  (B-1) \nwhere: \n\n\u00e0 ? ?? ? is the net force; \n\u00e0 N = d?d? is the velocity vector; \n\u00e0 d2?d?2 = ? is the acceleration vector; \n\u00e0 m is the mass of the particle; \n\n\u00e0 t is the instant of time. \n\nHowever, this statement is only valid for an inertial referential, a physical \n\nconcept defined by the Newton\u2019s First Law. To describe a movement in terms of the \n\nNewton\u2019s Second Law in a non-inertial referential, the case of an observer placed in a \n\nrotating system, for example, inertial forces must be added to the dynamics. Physically, \n\nthose forces do not exist, but they are felt by whatever is moving following a non-inertial \n\nframe. Thus, if N is measured at position ? by a fixed observer placed somewhere in a \nrotating system, the Eq. (B-1) can be given, for m constant on time, as: \n\n 1? ? ?? ?  =  [ ddF + ? \u00d7 ] [( ddF + ? \u00d7 ) ?]  =  [ ddF + ? \u00d7 ] (N + ? \u00d7 ?)  =  =  dNdF  +  2? \u00d7 N +  ? \u00d7 (? \u00d7 ?)  +  d?dF \u00d7 ? (B-2) \nwhere: \n\n\n\n 89 \n \n\n\u00e0 ? is the position vector with coordinates system fixed in the rotating frame; \n\u00e0 N = d?d? is the velocity measured in the rotating frame; \n\u00e0 ? is the angular velocity of the frame;  \n\u00e0 ? \u00d7 ? is the linear velocity of the rotating frame itself at position r; \n\u00e0 d?d?  is the variation in time of the velocity measured in the rotating frame; \n\u00e0 2? \u00d7 d?d?  is the acceleration due to the Coriolis inertial force; \n\u00e0 ? \u00d7 (? \u00d7 ?) is the acceleration due to the centrifugal inertial force; \n\u00e0 d?d? \u00d7 ? is the acceleration due to the Euler inertial force, that is zero if ? does \n\nnot vary on time. \n\nFor each single constant mass parcel of water that moves in the ocean with \n\nvelocity v measured at some point on the Earth, rotating with constant angular velocity ?, there will be accelerations due to the sum of forces that can drive the Eq. (B-2) to \nset up the form of the Navier-Stokes Equation:  DNDF + 2? \u00d7 N = ? 1t \u00a1D + \u00a2 + \u00a3t \u00a12N (B-3) \nwhere: \n\n\u00e0 N = N(?, F) is the Eulerian velocity field, at position ? in the instant t;  \n\u00e0 D = D(?, F) is the pressure field;  \n\u00e0 t = t(?, F) is the particle\u2019s density field; \n\u00e0 \u00a3 = \u00a3(?, F) is the dynamic viscosity; \n\u00e0 ? = ?(?) is the gravitational potential; \n\u00e0 ? \u00a5v\u00a6  is the Pressure Gradient Force per unit of mass; \n\u00e0 \u00a2 = ? \u00a1? ? ? \u00d7 (? \u00d7 ?) is the Gravity Force per unit of mass; \n\u00e0 \u00a7\u00a6 \u00a12N describes frictional forces per unit of mass; \n\u00e0 and the material derivative, is defined as:   DDF ? ??t + N ? \u00a1 (B-4) \n\nThe Eq. (B-3) describes the fluid in terms of fields, and each property is \n\nevaluated at a desired fixed point ? in space by an also fixed observer placed somewhere \n\n\n\n 90 \n \nin the Earth. This approach for characterizing the geophysical fluids is known as the \n\nEulerian description, and assumes a continuous or discrete space. \n\nOn the other hand, instead of analyzing the motion at arbitrary positions, the \n\nLagrangian description considers the referential frame following the flow by representing \n\nthe entire fluid as a sufficiently large number of indivisible particles (but not molecules), \n\nand evaluating the system state along the pathway, or, the trajectory, of those parcels \n\nof fluid. A complete Lagrangian formulation for the Earth\u2019s Ocean, therefore, provides a \n\ncontinuum description by tracking every single parcel of sea water in the world. \n\nFor a simpler discrete Lagrangian representation of the flow, consider a finite \u00aa  \nset of \u00ab  different particles with constant mass ?(\u00ac ), for \u00aa = 1,2,3, \u2026 , \u00ab . If each particle \nrepresents only one fluid parcel, the motion described by Eq. (B-2) can be written for \n\neach particle as:   1?(\u00ac ) ? ?(\u00ac )?? = [ ddF + ? \u00d7 ] [( ddF + ? \u00d7 ) \u00ad(\u00ac )] = ( ddF + ? \u00d7 ) (\u00af\u00b0(\u00ac ) + ? \u00d7 \u00ad(\u00ac )) (B-5) \nwhere:  \u00ad(\u00ac ) = \u00ad(\u00ac )(F) ? ?(\u00b20(\u00ac ), F) (B-6) \nis the vector function that describes the trajectory of the single particle P along time t, \nthat depends on its initial position \u00b20(\u00ac ) = \u00ad(\u00ac )(F0) = ?(\u00b20(\u00ac ), F0); \nand  \u00af\u00b0(\u00ac )(F) ? ddF \u00ad(\u00ac )(F) = D?DF \u00ad(\u00ac )(F) = \u00b4?F \u00ad(\u00ac ) (B-7) \nis defined as the Lagrangian velocity of the particle P at the instant of time t, and it \n\nrepresents the velocity that is felt by that particle, and by an observer that is moving \n\nwith the particle, at the instant t. \n\nIf N(?, F) describes the velocity of the fluid at the position ? = ?(\u00ac )(F) in space \nwith respect to a fixed referential frame, for an arbitrary instant t, from Eq. (B-3), (B-4) and (B-7), it can be seen that: \n\n\n\n 91 \n  N(?, F)|?= ?(\u00b5 ) = ddF ???= \u00b7(\u00b5 ) = ddF ?(\u00b20(\u00ac ), F) = ddF \u00ad(\u00ac )(F) ?  \u00af\u00b0(\u00ac )(F) (B-8) \nEq. (B-8) states that the Eulerian velocity v of the fluid evaluated at a fixed-point r in \n\nspace is equal to the Lagrangian velocity \u00af\u00b0, that is the velocity actually felt by the \nreferential frame of the fluid parcel P that occupies that position in space at that instant \n\nof time. \n\nIf the Eulerian velocity field N = N(?, F) is known, the pathways \u00ad(\u00ac ) = \u00ad(\u00ac )(F) \nfor each particle P, representing a discrete set for the Lagrangian frame, can be computed \n\nfrom Eq. (B-3), (B-6) and (B-8): \n\n \u00ad(\u00ac )(F) ? ?(\u00b20(\u00ac ), F) = ? N(?, F?)??0 dF? +  \u00b20(\u00ac ) (B-9) \nIn Eq. (B-7), the operator:  D?DF ? ??t (B-10) \n\nis called the Eulerian derivative, that added up to the Lagrangian derivative (or also \n\nmaterial derivative: the one that tracks the \u201cmoving material\u201d) given by Eq. (B-4) \n\nconstitute the transitioning connection between both descriptions. That enacts Eulerian \n\nand Lagrangian descriptions to be equivalent, but, in a practical way, they are also \n\ncomplimentary, once the choice for which one to employ should support the practical \n\nmethodology or fits to the objectives, that could be focused on studying motions of the \n\nfluid that happens at (fixed) desired positions or limited space or on tracking specific \n\nflows from some initial position. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nALLAN, R.P.
