Introduction\n\nRiparian forest zones exhibit hydrological, ecologi-\ncal and limnological functions important to the biotic and \nabiotic integrity of river systems (Zalewski et al., 2001, \nBarrella et al., 2000). According to these authors, in the \nstretches where the water volume is relatively small, the \ninfluence of vegetation is large. This is because vegeta-\ntion regulates the water flow, provides shelter and or-\nganic matter and substrate for algae and periphyton at-\ntachment.\n\nThe removal of bank vegetation causes many changes \nin lotic systems, including increased water temperature, \nsubstitution of a heterotrophic for an autotrophic system \nand the loss of sediment and nutrient retention capacity \n(Angermeier and Karr, 1983; Allan, 1995).\n\nEnvironmental analyses based on fish assemblage \nhave numerous advantages due to the information avail-\nable about the life cycles of a large number of species \n\nand to the inclusion of several feeding habits (omnivores, \nherbivores, insectivores, planktovores, carnivores), al-\nlowing the understanding of both the aquatic and ter-\nrestrial resources. Another advantage is the possibility \nof encountering this group at the top of the food chain, \nwhich provides an integrated vision of the aquatic envi-\nronment (Harris, 1995).\n\nThis study examines if there are associations be-\ntween fish species and the state of conservation of the \nriparian forest in the Corumbata\u00ed River Basin, in the state \nof S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. \n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\n2.1. Description of the study area\n\nThe Corumbata\u00ed River Basin includes an area of \napproximately 1690 km2 that contains around 13% \n\nECOLOGY\n\n\n\nCetra, M. and Petrere Jr., M.\n\nBraz. J. Biol., 67(2): 191-195, 2007192\n\nof the hydrographical basin of the Piracicaba, Jundia\u00ed \nand Capivari rivers, which is a S\u00e3o Paulo State Water \nResource Management unit. The study area is located \nbetween the meridians of 47\u00b0 30\u2019 and 47\u00b0 50\u2019 West and \nthe latitudes of 22\u00b0 05\u2019 and 22\u00b0 30\u2019 South (ATLAS..., \n2002).\n\nThe climate is of the Cwa type in the K\u00f6ppen classi-\nfication, which is subtropical, dry in the winter and rainy \nin the summer, with annual mean temperatures varying \nbetween 20 and 23.7 \u00b0C in January and between 14.9 and \n17.1 \u00b0C in July (ATLAS..., 2002).\n\nThere is currently only 9% of the original vegeta-\ntion cover, 6% of which corresponds to riparian for-\nest fragments in the Corumbata\u00ed River Basin and these \nfragments assume the key role as \u201cbiodiversity islands\u201d \n(Viana &amp; Mendes, 1997).\n\nThe waters of the Piracicaba River Basin are in a \ncritical state, while those of the Corumbata\u00ed River Basin \nare of high quality. Despite its being located on the bank \nof the voluminous Piracicaba River, the high quantity of \nchemical residues requires that the city of Piracicaba use \n100% of the water of the Corumbata\u00ed system to supply \nits population (ATLAS..., 2002).\n\nRio Claro is the most important city of the \nCorumbata\u00ed Basin with a population of 163,000, which \nrepresents 79.5% of the total population in this basin. Of \nthe total pollution generated in the Corumbata\u00ed Basin, \naround 30% is of industrial origin, while 70% comes \nfrom the sewage systems. Of all of the generated domes-\ntic sewage 98% is collected, however, only 5% of that is \neffectively treated. It is estimated that in Rio Claro, 97% \nof the pollution comes from sewage and the other 3% is \nof industrial origin (ATLAS..., 2002). Therefore sewage \nis the main pollutant in the Corumbata\u00ed system.\n\nThe Ribeir\u00e3o Claro River shows large anthropic \nalterations, including two dams. The one in the middle \nstretch is used to supply water to the city of Rio Claro. \nBelow this dam, untreated sewage is drained into the \nriver along a stretch of about 3 km. The other dam is in \nthe low stretch, and was previously used for the genera-\ntion of energy.\n\n2.2. Fish sampling \n\nDuring 2001, 2 collections were performed at \n12 sites: one from March to June and the other between \nSeptember and December. The collections were per-\nformed in four of the main rivers of the basin: the Passa \nCinco, the Cabe\u00e7a, the Corumbata\u00ed and the Ribeir\u00e3o \nClaro. In each river, three stretches of around 150 m \nwere sampled in the downstream direction.\n\nFishes were sampled with a series of gillnets (3 to \n9 cm mesh, opposite knots) and with 3 pairs of sieves. \nThe nets and sieves were placed in the afternoon (be-\ntween 15 and 18 hours) and left until the following \nmorning (between 7 and 9 hours). Nets were placed and \ndistributed along the margins in each point in a random \nway. Pairs of traps were placed in suitable places along \nthe channel.\n\n2.3. Habitat elements\n\nThe following habitat elements were recorded: the \norder of the rivers (4, 5 and 6); the preservation level \nof the riparian forest: preserved, partially deforested and \ntotally deforested; the shade level: 0-25, 26-50, 51-75 \nand above 76%; Eucalyptus sp.: presence or absence; \nsugar cane: presence or absence; pastures: presence or \nabsence; sewage drainage: presence or absence; the sur-\nrounding declivity stability: low or high.\n\n2.4. Data analysis\n\nTo analyze the structure of the fish assemblages a \ndetrended correspondence analysis (DCA) was applied \n(Gauch, 1982). The first two axes of the DCA, and the \nscores of the 35 collected species, were used to visualize \nthe data in two dimensions. The weight of the rare spe-\ncies was reduced. \n\nA principal component analysis (PCA) was applied \nto reduce the dimensionality of the data of the habitat \nelements. The number of principal components was de-\ntermined by the Kaiser-Guttman criterion (components \nwith eigenvalue less than one were removed) (McGarigal \net al., 2000).\n\nA nonparametric analysis of variance was applied \n(Kruskal-Wallis test) for the axes 1 and 2 of the DCA. \nThe different rivers were considered as independent \ngroups. \n\nMultiple regression analyses were applied to quan-\ntify the relationship between species richness, different \naxes of the PCA and species abundance (number of indi-\nviduals) (Marsh-Matthews &amp; Matthews, 2000).\n\n3. Results\n\nThe detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) indi-\ncated that Astyanax fasciatus (Afas), Pimelodella gracilis \n(Pgra) and Hypostomus regani (Hreg) are associated with \npoint 2 of the Corumbata\u00ed, just as Triportheus angulatus \n(Tang), Parodon tortuosus (Ptor) and Hyphessobrycon \neques (Hequ) are associated with site 3 (Figure 1). \nHoplosternum littorale (Hlit) is associated with point 3 \nof the Ribeir\u00e3o Claro river. Maximum abundance of \nSalminus hilarii (Shil), Prochilodus lineatus (Plin) and \nLeporinus octofasciauts (Loct) was found in points 1 and \n2 of the same river.\n\nThe cascudo Hypostomus strigaticeps was frequent-\nly captured in the Corumbata\u00ed River Basin, especially \nat points with shade between 0-25% (248 individuals). \nWithin the four categories of shade, this species was as-\nsociated with points of low shade (X2 = 437.13; df = 3; \np &lt;0.01).\n\nThe principal components analysis (PCA) based on \nthe habitat elements data indicates a positive association \nbetween the first axis with the river order (35.72% of \nexplication), the second axis with the vegetative cover \nand the preservation state of the riparian forest (27.96% \nof explication) and an negative association between the \nthird axis with pasture presence (12.54% of explication) \n(Table 1). \n\n\n\nFish assemblage and riparian vegetation in the Corumbata\u00ed River Basin (SP)\n\nBraz. J. Biol., 67(2): 191-195, 2007 193\n\nIn the analysis of variance (ANOVA), a signifi-\ncant difference was not found between the differ-\nent rivers (axis 1: X2 = 7.308; df = 3; p = 0.063 and  \naxis 2: X2 = 5.519; df = 3; p = 0.137).\n\nSpecies richness was significantly predicted by the \nnumber of individuals and the scores derived from the \nsecond principal component (r2 = 0.974; F = 184.98;  \np &lt;0.001) (Table 2 and Figure 2).\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThe DCA results indicate a low spatial heterogeneity \nwhen the primary structure of the fish assemblage (spe-\ncies composition and distribution abundance) is consid-\nered (Figure 1). This is supported by the ANOVA, where \na significant difference was not found between the rivers \nusing the scores of the axes 1 and 2 of the DCA. \n\nThese results coincide with those of Toepfer et al. \n(1998), because of the small size of the Corumbata\u00ed \nRiver Basin, which is around 1700 km2. These authors \nstate that there exists a smaller assemblage gradient in \necoregions, or in this case, in the hydrographic basin, \nthan in larger regions, principally because of the high \nmobility of the fish.\n\n80\n\n80\n\n40\n\n40\nAxis 1\n\nA\nxi\n\ns \n2\n\n0\n0\n\nco2\n\nco3\nco1\n\nca2\n\nca3 rc1\nrc3\n\nrc2pc2\n\npc1\n\npc3\n\nca1\n\n80\n\n80\n\n40\n\n40\n0\n\n0\n\nA\nxi\n\ns \n2\n\nAxis 1\n\nPtor Hequ\nTang\n\nHlit\n\nLoct Plin Shil Afas Hreg\n\nPgra\n\nFigure 1.

J. Biol., 67(2): 191-195, 2007194\n\nThe logarithm of the number of individuals was a \ngood predictor of species richness (Table 2). This can be \ninterpreted as a result of the sample size effect (Connor \nand McCoy, 2001). \n\nAccording to classic ecological models like the spe-\ncies-area relationship (MacArthur and Wilson, 1967) \nand the river continuum concept (Vannote et al., 1980), \nit is expected that an increase in the number of spe-\ncies will be found as the order of the river increases \n(Angermeier and Schlosser, 1989; Osborne and Wiley, \n1992). In accordance with these models, river sections \nnear to the headwaters show lower species richness than \nthose downstream in the Corumbata\u00ed River Basin (Cetra, \n2003). This was found at point 1 of both the Cabe\u00e7a and \nCorumbata\u00ed rivers. \n\nThe preceding descriptive models are insufficient \nto understand the complex landscape of the Corumbata\u00ed \nRiver Basin. It is necessary to consider the relationships \nwithin the river together with its surroundings because \nthe landscape consists of a mosaic made up of small ar-\neas connected by corridors that permit contact between \nthe environments.\n\nThe results of this work agree with the idea that the \nriparian forests is associated to fish fauna. Although they \nare located in the more elevated river sections, point 1 \nof the Passa Cinco and Ribeir\u00e3o Claro rivers exhibit \nthe best conditions in terms of riparian forest conserva-\ntion, and more species were captured at these locations  \n(Figure 2). \n\nThis situation can be explained through the environ-\nmental characteristics of these points. The first site of the \nPassa Cinco River is characterized by a typical \u201ccuesta\u201d \nrelief with rocky outcrops and steep but stable run-off \ntrenches. The marginal vegetation is responsible for  \n51-75% shading, with partial deforestation, thin trees, \nbushes and herbs and some areas covered by grasses. \nThe river bed is rocky and graveled with a small amount \nof sand. A large quantity of habitats occur, amongst them \npools, runs and riffles. This point is frequented by sport \nfishermen seeking lambaris Astyanax spp. \n\nAt the first site of the Ribeir\u00e3o Claro River, 16 spe-\ncies and 39 individuals were captured, which could be \nconsidered outliers in the relation of species richness to \nabundance. This can be explained by the environmen-\ntal characteristics of this point: a lightly undulated relief \nwith planar areas, a steep and stable river bank, flooded \nareas and conserved riparian vegetation, with shading \nabove 75%. The presence of tabaranas Salminus hilarii \nat this point (Figure 1), a predator population, suggests \nthe biological integrity of this location. This indicates \nthe high diversity of other species in this area, due to \nthe high degree of the environmental selectivity of this \nspecies and its position in the food chain (Alves and \nPompeu, 2001).\n\nThe low richness of point 3 of the Ribeir\u00e3o Claro \nRiver may be a function of the intense anthropic ac-\ntions. It is located 1 km above the confluence with the \nCorumbata\u00ed River, which theoretically indicates the \n\npossibility of high species richness. But, its location up-\nstream from the second dam and downstream from the \nuntreated Rio Claro sewage outlet contributes to a most-\nly organic river bed. In addition, the marginal vegetation \nis made up of pasture grasses, vines and Eucalyptus sp., \nproviding 0 to 25% shading. The aquatic vegetation con-\nsists of floating macrophytes and grasses. Eighteen indi-\nviduals of caborja Hoplosternum littorale were collected \nat this point from September to December. The occur-\nrence of this species is explained by its ability to cease \nfeeding and use its intestine strictly for aerial breathing \n(Signorini,1999).\n\nLike Power (1984), the data of this study suggest an \nassociation between a low shade level and the cascudos \nHypostomus strigaticeps. Hahn et al. (1997) classify it \nas a detritivore, having identified various generas of dia-\ntoms, filamentous algae, insect larvae (Chironomidae) \nand Nematoda in its stomach, which confirms that these \nfish are important controllers of alga populations. This \ndata also indicates that with low levels of shade, these \nsites become autotrophic (Angermeier and Karr, 1983; \nAllan, 1995), creating more food for this species. \n\nThe interpretation of these results cannot be ignored. \nIt demonstrates that intense anthropic action has caused \nthe elimination of natural heterogeneity, the presence \nof which would have theoretically supported greater \nbiological and environmental diversity (Magurran, 2004; \nBegon et al., 1996).\n\nAcknowledgments \u2014 The authors are grateful to the anonymous \nreviewer for suggestions and coments on an earlier version of \nthe manuscript.\n\nReferences\n\nALLAN, JD., 1995.
