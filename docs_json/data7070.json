It's not easy, because life \n\nuses only a subset of the elements in the periodic \n\ntable. And we use all of them, even the toxic ones.\u201d \n\n (Janine Benyus, 1958) \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\n \n\nRenewable resources are earning special attention as substitutes \n\nfor petroleum-based compounds, considering the future shortage of \n\nfossil supplies and also due to a sense of environmental awareness. In \n\nthis context, biobased polymers obtained from vegetable oils are \n\nconsidered a promising \u201cgreen\u201d alternative to fossil-derived polymeric \n\nmaterials and present potential biodegradability and low toxicity, \n\nallowing their application for high value added and/or biomedical \n\npurposes. Acyclic Diene Metathesis (ADMET) and thiol-ene reactions \n\nappear as successful and versatile techniques to obtain high molecular \n\nweight polymers from renewable raw materials, enhancing the \n\npossibilities for the synthesis of vegetable oil-based polymers via \n\nchemical modifications. Additionally, besides avoiding the use of \n\norganic solvents, working with an environmentally friendly system, \n\nminiemulsion polymerization enables the production of polymeric \n\nnanoparticles with unique characteristics and vast commercial interest, \n\nwith the possibility of using and/or incorporating water-insoluble \n\ncompounds for a wide range of applications. Herein, it is reported the \n\nsynthesis and characterization of biobased polymeric nanoparticles \n\nusing a 100% renewable ?,?-diene-diester monomer obtained by \n\nesterification reaction of 10-undecenoic acid (derived from castor oil) \n\nwith 1,3-propanediol (derived from glycerol, which is also derived from \n\ncastor oil). ADMET and thiol-ene polymerization reactions were \n\nsuccessfully performed in miniemulsion and yielded polymers with \n\nweight average molecular weight up to 15 kDa (Mn), depending on \n\ndifferent parameters and type of reactants (comonomers, surfactants, \n\ncatalysts) employed. Then, the poly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles were \n\nmodified by the oxidation of their sulfur atom to sulfoxide and sulfone \n\ngroups, aiming the development of nanoparticles with high potential for \n\nthe encapsulation and release of bioactive compounds. Lastly, results \n\nrevealed that the synthesized poly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles derived \n\nfrom renewable resources did not present any cytotoxic effect on murine \n\nfibroblast (L929) and human cervical cancer (HeLa) cells and showed \n\nhigh blood biocompatibility, assuring their viability for biomedical \n\napplications. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Biobased polymers.

Neste contexto, biopol\u00edmeros obtidos a partir de \n\n\u00f3leos vegetais s\u00e3o considerados uma promissora alternativa ecol\u00f3gica \n\naos materiais polim\u00e9ricos derivados de fontes f\u00f3sseis, apresentando \n\npotencial biodegradabilidade e baixa toxicidade, permitindo sua \n\naplica\u00e7\u00e3o para prop\u00f3sitos de alto valor agregado e/ou fins biom\u00e9dicos. \n\nAs rea\u00e7\u00f5es de met\u00e1tese de dienos ac\u00edclicos (ADMET) e tiol-eno \n\naparecem como t\u00e9cnicas bem sucedidas e vers\u00e1teis para a obten\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\npol\u00edmeros de elevada massa molar derivados de mat\u00e9rias-primas \n\nrenov\u00e1veis, aumentando as possibilidades para a s\u00edntese de pol\u00edmeros \n\nderivados de \u00f3leos vegetais a partir de modifica\u00e7\u00f5es qu\u00edmicas. Al\u00e9m \n\ndisso, a polimeriza\u00e7\u00e3o em miniemuls\u00e3o \u00e9 um sistema ambientalmente \n\namig\u00e1vel, livre de solventes org\u00e2nicos e permite a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nnanopart\u00edculas polim\u00e9ricas com caracter\u00edsticas \u00fanicas e de grande \n\ninteresse comercial, com a possibilidade de utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o e/ou incorpora\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde compostos e comp\u00f3sitos insol\u00faveis em \u00e1gua para uma vasta gama de \n\naplica\u00e7\u00f5es, inclusive para fins biom\u00e9dicos. A possibilidade da obten\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde pol\u00edmeros em meio aquoso, cuja s\u00edntese tradicional \u00e9 sens\u00edvel \u00e0 \u00e1gua, \n\ntais como poli\u00e9steres, \u00e9 uma grande vantagem das rea\u00e7\u00f5es de \n\npolimeriza\u00e7\u00e3o ADMET e tiol-eno em miniemuls\u00e3o. Al\u00e9m disso, muitos \n\noutros tipos de materiais podem ser obtidos como, por exemplo, \n\nnanocomp\u00f3sitos, nanoc\u00e1psulas e part\u00edculas h\u00edbridas. Como vantagem \n\nadicional, pol\u00edmeros que contenham grupos \u00e9ster na cadeia principal \n\npodem sofrer hidr\u00f3lise, permitindo a sua degrada\u00e7\u00e3o em ambiente \n\nfisiol\u00f3gico, fator de grande import\u00e2ncia para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas ou \n\nmesmo para a elimina\u00e7\u00e3o do material polim\u00e9rico no meio ambiente. \n\nDessa forma, o objetivo do presente trabalho foi a s\u00edntese e \n\ncaracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o de nanopart\u00edculas polim\u00e9ricas utilizando um mon\u00f4mero \n\n?,?-dieno-di\u00e9ster 100% renov\u00e1vel, obtido atrav\u00e9s da rea\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nesterifica\u00e7\u00e3o do \u00e1cido 10-undecenoico (derivado do \u00f3leo de mamona) \n\ncom o 1,3-propanodiol (derivado do glicerol, que tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 derivado do \n\n\u00f3leo de mamona). Rea\u00e7\u00f5es de polimeriza\u00e7\u00e3o ADMET e tiol-eno em \n\nminiemuls\u00e3o foram realizadas com sucesso e produziram pol\u00edmeros com \n\nmassa molar m\u00e9dia de at\u00e9 15 kDa (Mn), dependendo de diferentes \n\npar\u00e2metros e do tipo de reagentes (comon\u00f4meros, surfactantes, \n\ncatalisadores) utilizados. No estudo das rea\u00e7\u00f5es ADMET, a grande \u00e1rea \n\nsuperficial da fase org\u00e2nica nas rea\u00e7\u00f5es em miniemuls\u00e3o provavelmente \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\naumentou a remo\u00e7\u00e3o de etileno (subproduto) do meio reacional, \n\nfavorecendo a rea\u00e7\u00e3o ADMET e atingindo pol\u00edmeros com massas \n\nmolares maiores do que os pol\u00edmeros obtidos por polimeriza\u00e7\u00e3o em \n\nmassa. Atrav\u00e9s dos resultados obtidos, foi observado que o catalisador \n\nUmicore M2 e o surfactante n\u00e3o-i\u00f4nico Lutensol AT80 formaram a \n\ncombina\u00e7\u00e3o mais adequada para a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de rea\u00e7\u00f5es ADMET em \n\nminiemuls\u00e3o. Quando rea\u00e7\u00f5es tiol-eno foram realizadas em \n\nminiemuls\u00e3o, tr\u00eas diferentes mon\u00f4meros ?,?-dienos (1,7-octadieno, 1,3-\n\npropileno dipenta-1-enoato e 1,3-propileno diundeca-10-enoato) e dois \n\nditi\u00f3is diferentes (1,4-butanoditiol e 2-mercaptoetil \u00e9ter) foram testados \n\ne os resultados foram comparados. O iniciador AIBN apresentou uma \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o ideal (1 mol%) para a s\u00edntese de pol\u00edmeros com massa \n\nmolar mais elevada, diferente do comportamento esperado em \n\npolimeriza\u00e7\u00f5es tradicionais via radicais livres. Em seguida, as \n\nnanopart\u00edculas de poli(tio\u00e9ter-\u00e9ster) obtidas foram modificadas atrav\u00e9s \n\nda oxida\u00e7\u00e3o do \u00e1tomo de enxofre em grupos sulf\u00f3xido e sulfona, \n\nvisando \u00e0 obten\u00e7\u00e3o de nanopart\u00edculas com elevado potencial para o \n\nencapsulamento e libera\u00e7\u00e3o de compostos bioativos. An\u00e1lises de DLS \n\n(Espalhamento Din\u00e2mico de Luz) e MET (Microscopia Eletr\u00f4nica de \n\nTransmiss\u00e3o) asseguraram a estabilidade de tamanho/polidispers\u00e3o e \n\nmorfologia das nanopart\u00edculas mesmo ap\u00f3s o processo de oxida\u00e7\u00e3o; \n\nan\u00e1lises de FTIR e TGA confirmaram a presen\u00e7a de grupos sulf\u00f3xido e \n\nsulfona ap\u00f3s a oxida\u00e7\u00e3o. Por \u00faltimo, foram realizadas an\u00e1lises de \n\nbiocompatibilidade das nanopart\u00edculas de poli(tio\u00e9ter-\u00e9ster) obtidas. \n\nResultados revelaram que as nanopart\u00edculas de origem renov\u00e1vel n\u00e3o \n\nexibiram efeito citot\u00f3xico em c\u00e9lulas de fibroblasto murinho (L929) e \n\nc\u00e2ncer cervical humano (HeLa) e, al\u00e9m disso, apresentaram alta \n\nhemocompatibilidade, viabilizando futuras aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas como \n\nsistemas carreadores de f\u00e1rmacos. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Biopol\u00edmeros.

interest in biobased polymers as \n\nsubstitutes for petroleum-based compounds has been observed in the last \n\nyears, considering the depletion of fossil oil reserves and especially due \n\nto a sense of environmental awareness for waste management (MEIER, \n\n2009; T\u00dcR\u00dcN\u00c7; MEIER, 2011; Z. BEYAZKILIC et al., 2015). In this \ncontext, vegetable oils are one of the most important renewable raw \n\nmaterials for the polymer industry due to their relatively low cost, ready \n\navailability and value added application possibilities (SHARMA; \n\nKUNDU, 2006; BELGACEM; GANDINI, 2008; MEIER, 2011). \n\nMoreover, only a few minor modification reactions (if necessary) have \n\nto be performed in order to obtain suitable monomers for many different \n\napplications (MONTERO DE ESPINOSA; MEIER, 2011).  \n\nThe main components of vegetable oils are triacylglycerols \n\n(triglycerides), which are highly functionalized molecules, and, \n\ntherefore, have been used in the synthesis of different types of \n\nmonomers and polymers (G\u00dcNER; YA?CI; ERCIYES, 2006; \n\nMONTERO DE ESPINOSA; MEIER, 2011). Also, the hydrolysis of \n\ntriglycerides provides glycerol (which is widely used as building block \n\nin polymer science finding application in the synthesis of polyurethanes, \n\npolyesters, or telomers) and a mixture of saturated and unsaturated fatty \n\nacids (that are largely studied as renewable building blocks for the \n\nsynthesis of polymers with high added value and specific properties). \n\nThe reactivity of the unsaturated bonds of both triglyceride and isolated \n\nfatty acids allows vegetable oils to be employed in a variety of \n\npolymerization reactions (KARAK; RANA; CHO, 2009; MUTLU, \n\n2012; T\u00dcR\u00dcN\u00c7, 2012). \n\nContributing for sustainable development not only consists in \n\nusing renewable raw materials, but also involves the application of \n\nenvironmentally friendly and high efficient processes. In this line, \n\nmetathesis and click chemistry reactions have arisen as a great step \n\nforward for \u201cgreen chemistry\u201d and have opened new paths for the \n\nsynthesis and modification of polymeric materials with targeted \n\nproperties (PORRES, 2013; MONTERO DE ESPINOSA; MEIER, \n\n2011). Besides, Acyclic Diene Metathesis (ADMET) and thiol-ene \n\npolymerization reactions enhance the possibilities for the synthesis of \n\nvegetable oil-based polymers via chemical modifications through the \n\ndouble bonds of ?,?-diene monomers (T\u00dcR\u00dcN\u00c7; MEIER, 2011).  \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\nOrganic solvent-free miniemulsion polymerization reactions \n\nenable to work with an environmentally friendly system and afford \n\npolymeric nanoparticles with microstructures inaccessible by other \n\npolymerization techniques (PECHER; MECKING, 2007). In addition, \n\nminiemulsion polymerization is a versatile technique and presents some \n\nattractive advantages such as easier temperature control and radical \n\ncompartmentalization inside the polymer particles (promoting high \n\npolymerization rates and allowing to obtain high molecular weight \n\npolymers) with the possibility of using and/or incorporating water-\n\ninsoluble compounds for a wide range of applications, including \n\nbiomedical purposes (EL-AASSER; MILLER, 1997; ASUA, 2002; \n\nANTONIETTI; LANDFESTER, 2002; SCHORK et al., 2005; \n\nCARDOSO; ARAUJO; SAYER, 2013).  \n\nThere is a high demand for polymeric systems that satisfy a \n\nnumber of requirements, such as biodegradability and biocompatibility, \n\nfor biomedical applications (T\u00dcR\u00dcN\u00c7; MEIER, 2011). Such novel \n\nmaterials have been widely used in temporary implants, tissue \n\nengineering and drug delivery systems (MACHADO; SAYER; \n\nARA\u00daJO, 2016). In this field, biobased polymers obtained from \n\nvegetable oils are considered very promising due to their potential \n\nbiodegradability (it is possible to include functional groups or even \n\nchemical bonds that may facilitate biodegradation) and low toxicity \n\n(BIERMANN et al., 2000; SHARMA; KUNDU, 2006; LLIGADAS et \n\nal., 2010). \nBased on the above facts, ADMET and thiol-ene polymerization \n\nin miniemulsion are being recently investigated (PECHER; MECKING, \n\n2007; 2010; CARDOSO et al., 2014; JASINSKI et al., 2014; LOBRY et \nal., 2014; AMATO et al., 2015; MACHADO et al., 2016), but works \n\nportraying the polymerization of renewable monomers through these \n\nreactions in aqueous media are still uncommon in the literature \n\n(WURM; WEISS, 2014; MACHADO et al., 2016). Furthermore, apart \n\nfrom the advantages already mentioned, ADMET and thiol-ene \n\nreactions allow the synthesis of high molecular weight polyesters in \n\naqueous dispersed medium and thereby are suitable for the production of \n\npolymeric nanoparticles containing ester groups in the main chain, \n\nwhich can undergo hydrolysis (RYDHOLM; BOWMAN; ANSETH, \n\n2005; RYDHOLM; ANSETH; BOWMAN, 2007) enabling their \n\ndegradation in physiological environment. These characteristics are of \n\ngreat importance for biomedical applications or material disposal \n\n(JASINSKI et al., 2014; MACHADO; SAYER; ARA\u00daJO, 2016). \n\n  \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\n1.1 OBJECTIVES \n \n\n1.1.1 General Objectives  \n \n\nThis work, in collaboration with Professor Dr. Michael A.

Firstly, the synthesis of vegetable oils-derived monomers \n\nfor the production of new polymers is introduced. Then, metathesis and \n\nthiol-ene reactions are presented, describing characteristics, conditions \n\nand applications. Lastly, miniemulsion polymerization is discussed, with \n\nits mechanisms and specificities. \n\n \n\n2.1 SYNTHESIS OF MONOMERS FROM VEGETABLE OILS \n \n\nCurrently, vegetable oils are one of the most important sources of \n\nrenewable raw materials for the chemical industry (in Germany, for \n\nexample, 30% of the 2.7 million tons of raw materials from renewable \n\nsources consumed in 2005 were vegetable oils) and they are widely used \n\nfor manufacturing surfactants, cosmetics and lubricants (MEIER; \n\nMETZGER; SCHUBERT, 2007). These renewable raw materials show \n\ngreat potential as sustainable resources for the polymer industry because \n\nthe synthetic potential of naturally occurring fatty acids can be exploited \n\nfor monomer and polymer synthesis without many reaction steps. \n\nAdditionally, thermoplastic materials having linear and hyperbranched \n\narchitectures, resulting in polymers with tunable properties, can be \n\nprepared from fatty acids and their derivatives (T\u00dcR\u00dcN\u00c7, 2012; \n\nKARAK; RANA; CHO, 2009). \n\nAccording to Meier (2011), the use of vegetable oils as a \n\nrenewable raw material in the polymer industry is a challenge and an \n\nopportunity that may allow the replacement of existing polymerization \n\nprocesses based on petroleum compounds. This approach is not only \n\nenvironmentally friendly (green chemistry) because the potential use of \n\nrenewable natural resources is exploited in an efficient manner, but it \n\nwill also be necessary in a few decades due to the depletion of fossil \n\nresources. \n\nThe main constituents of vegetable oils are triacylglycerols \n\n(Figure 1), derived from the esterification of glycerol with three fatty \n\nacids, which make up 95% of the total weight of triglycerides. \n\nDepending on the fatty acids content, each vegetable oil has specific \n\nchemical and physical properties (MONTERO DE ESPINOSA; MEIER, \n\n2011; G\u00dcNER; YA?CI; ERCIYES, 2006), which are affected by the \n\nstereochemistry of the double bonds of the fatty acids chains, the \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\nunsaturation degree and the carbon chain length (MEIER, METZGER; \n\nSCHUBERT, 2007). \n\n \nFigure 1. Chemical structure of triglycerides. R1, R2 e R3 correspond to the fatty \n\nacid chains. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nSource: Author. \n\n \n\nDepending on the used vegetable oils, the separation process can \n\nlead to a wide variety of fatty acids (saturated or unsaturated), each one \n\nhaving different types of functional groups (-OH, epoxy, triple bonds, \n\netc.). Table 1 presents the fatty acid content and number of double bonds \n\nper triglyceride of the most common commodity vegetable oils.  \n\n \nTable 1.

The most commonly fatty \n\nacids used in polymer chemistry are: oleic, linoleic, linolenic, ricinoleic \n\nand erucic acids; their structures are shown in Figure 2. \n\n \nFigure 2. Chemical structures of the fatty acids most commonly used in the \n\npolymer chemistry. (a) oleic, (b) linoleic, (c) linolenic, (d) ricinoleic, (e) erucic. \n\n \n \n\nSource: Adapted from ESPINOSA; MEIER, 2011. \n\n \n\nTypically, a triglyceride chain presents 5 chemically reactive \n\nsites, shown in Figure 3, suitable for posterior modification and \n\nsynthesis of different types of monomer (MUTLU, 2012). However, \n\nresearches about chemical modifications of vegetable oils basically \n\npresent simple variations of the acyl group of the fatty acid. Regarding \n\nthe use of vegetable oils and fatty acids in chemical industries, the most \n\nclassic and well-established chemical transformations is directed to the \n\ncarboxyl and ester groups and relatively underachieved in the side chain \n\n(MEIER; METZGER; SCHUBERT, 2007; GANDINI, 2008; \n\nRONDA et al., 2011; MONTERO DE ESPINOSA; MEIER, 2011). \nWhen using these conventional modification reactions in the carboxylic \n\ngroup, fatty acids are converted into fatty alcohols, soaps, esters, \n\nthioesters, amides or amines hydrazides (KREUTZER, 1984; HEDMAN \n\net al., 2003; TAKAGAKI et al., 2006; BARRAULT; POUILLOUX, \n\n1997). \nIn the past few decades, the selective functionalization of the fatty \n\nacids alkyl chains has been extensively researched with particular \n\nattention to the double bond of unsaturated compounds. Surprisingly, \n\nonly a few reactions using the double bond of unsaturated fatty \n\ncompounds are currently applied in the chemical industry: \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\nhydrogenation, epoxidation and ozone cleavage (BIERMANN et al., \n\n2011). Radical, electrophilic, nucleophilic and also pericyclic additions \n\nto the double bond of unsaturated fatty acids may lead to a large number \n\nof novel oleochemicals with interesting characteristics. \n \n\nFigure 3. Reactive sites of a generic triglyceride.  \n\n \nSource: Adapted from MUTLU (2012). \n\n \n\nRegarding chemical modifications through the double bonds, \n\nolefin metathesis and thiol-ene reactions appear as alternative and \n\nefficient processes, enhancing the possibilities for synthesis of vegetable \n\noil-based polymers. These two types of reactions are described \n\nseparately in the following sections (2.2 e 2.3).  \n\n \n\n2.1.1 Castor oil as renewable raw material \n \n\nIn addition to the above mentioned possible chemical \n\nmodifications of existing reactive sites in triglycerides, some fatty acids \n\nnaturally present different functional groups in their alkyl chains. Today, \n\nthe only commercial source of a substituted fatty acid is castor oil, \n\ncultivated all over the world in temperate zones (MUTLU, 2012). Castor \n\noil is a triglyceride composed of fatty acids and glycerol, like any other \n\nvegetable oil, and 90% of its fatty acid content consists of ricinoleic acid \n\n- whose carbon chain has a hydroxyl, a very reactive radical. The high \n\nlevel of this fatty acid is the reason for the high value of castor oil and \n\nits several application possibilities in the chemical industry (MUTLU; \n\nMEIER, 2010). \n\nPyrolysis of castor oil (Figure 4) splits the ricinoleate molecule in \n\nheptaldehyde and undecenoic acid, as well as light gases and a small \n\nfraction of free fatty acids (saturated and unsaturated) from C10 to C18. \n\nThese two products, heptaldehyde and 10-undecenoic acid, are \n\nimportant raw materials for cosmetics (C11 and C7 aldehydes are used \n\nin soaps, shampoos, talcum powders and perfume formulations), \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\npharmaceutical and polymeric compounds. Furthermore, heptaldehyde \n\nis used as a solvent for rubbers, resins and plastics and 10-undecenoic \n\nacid may be directly used for applications as bactericides and fungicides \n\nagents (MUTLU; MEIER, 2010). \n\nAdditionally, 10-undecenoic acid proved to be an important \n\nprecursor for the synthesis of antitumor compounds, antibiotics and, \n\nespecially, is one of the oldest renewable \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d used in the \n\nindustry as precursor for Nylon 11 (MUTLU; MEIER, 2010; VAN DER \n\nSTEEN; STEVENS, 2009). Due to the presence of hydroxyl groups in \n\nits chain, castor oil can be used in the synthesis of a wide variety of \n\npolyurethane products, ranging from coatings, thermoplastic elastomers, \n\nrigid and semi-rigid foams, sealants and adhesives for flexible foams, \n\nclearly showing that castor oil is one of the most promising renewable \n\nraw materials for the chemical and polymer industry (SHARMA; \n\nKUNDU, 2008; PETROVIC, 2008; MUTLU, 2012). \n\n \nFigure 4. Synthesis of two of the most used chemicals in the chemical industry, \n\nderived from castor oil by pyrolysis: heptaldehyde and 10-undecenoic acid. \n\n \n\n \nSource: Author. \n\n \n\n2.2 OLEFIN METATHESIS \n \n\nAmong the wide range of organic and organometallic reactions \n\nallowing obtaining new unsaturated molecules, olefin metathesis \n\nappears as a very versatile tool that enables chemical transformations \n\nthat were challenging (or even impossible) to perform by any other \n\nmeans (RYBAK; FOKOU; MEIER, 2008). Through metathesis \n\nreactions it is possible to obtain structurally simple olefins having \n\ndifferent chain lengths and unsaturation degrees, as well as mono- and \n\ndiesters compounds (IVIN; MOL, 1997). \n\nOlefin metathesis, or transalkylidenation, is a chemical reaction \n\ninvolving the position (in Greek: tithemi) exchange (meta) of alkene \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\nfragments generated by the scission of carbon-carbon double bonds. The \n\nterm \"olefin metathesis\" was firstly introduced by Calderon and \n\ncoworkers in 1960, although there were already reports of \n\ntransalkilidenation reactions since 1950 (CALDERON; CHEN; SCOTT, \n\n1967; CALDERON, 1972). Proposed for the first time by H\u00e9risson and \n\nChauvin in 1971, the accepted mechanism for this transformation \n\nreaction proceeds, in a reversible manner, through a cycloaddition \n\n[2 + 2] of an olefinic double bond with a metallocarbene, and the \n\nconsequent cycloreversion of the metallacyclobutane in the opposite \n\nsense leads to a new olefin and a metal alkylidene, as shown in Figure 5 \n\n(H\u00c9RISSON; CHAUVIN, 1971). \n\n \nFigure 5. Mechanism for the olefin metathesis reaction proposed by Chauvin. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nSource: Adapted from H\u00c9RISSON; CHAUVIN (1971). \n\n \n\nOlefin metathesis, as depicted in Figure 6, occurs mostly via five \n\nkinds of chemical reactions, including ring-opening metathesis (ROM), \n\nring-closing metathesis (RCM), ring-opening metathesis polymerization \n\n(ROMP), acyclic diene metathesis polymerization (ADMET) and cross-\n\nmetathesis (CM) (MUTLU, 2012; MATOS et al., 2007). Cross-\n\nmetathesis is a reaction using olefins from two different types, ring-\n\nopening metathesis is characterized by the formation of non-conjugated \n\ndienes from cyclic olefins and it is the reverse reaction of the ring-\n\nclosing metathesis. In addition, polymerization reactions may occur \n\nbetween acyclic dienes (ADMET) or involving a chain-growth of cyclic \n\nalkenes to linear unsaturated polymers (ROMP) (FREDERICO; \n\nBROCKSOM; BROCKSOM, 2005).  \n\nMetathesis reactions are generally reversible and, with an \n\nappropriate catalyst system, equilibrium can be reached in a matter of \n\nseconds, even with substrate/catalyst ratios of 10\n4\n (IVIN; MOL, 1997). \n\nDespite being an excellent tool for organic synthesis, studies about \n\nolefin metathesis reaction had only a significant advance since the 90s, \n\nafter the development of organometallic compounds by Schrock and \n\nGrubbs (IVIN; MOL, 1997). The Schrock catalysts, based on neutral \n\ntungsten and molybdenum alkylidene complexes, are highly reactive \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\ntowards different substrates with different steric and electronic \n\nvariations, capable of reacting with internal and terminal olefins, but \n\nthey show sensitivity to polar functional groups, humidity, oxygen, and \n\nimpurities present in the solvent, restricting their usage (SCHROCK et \n\nal., 1980).  \n \n\nFigure 6. Most important types of olefin metathesis reactions: CM (Cross-\n\nMetathesis), RCM (Ring Closing Metathesis), ROM (Ring Opening \n\nMetathesis), ROMP (Ring Opening Metathesis Polymerization) and ADMET \n\n(Acyclic Diene METathesis).  \n\n \n \n\nSource: Author. \n\n \n\nKinetic and mechanistic studies were fundamental to the \n\ndevelopment of the so-called well-defined catalysts for metathesis \n\nreactions, known as first and second-generation Grubbs catalysts, which \n\nare ruthenium catalytic systems, more robust in air and with various \n\npolar functional groups. Furthermore, these catalysts enable reactions \n\nunder mild conditions, such as atmospheric pressure and temperatures \n\nbelow 100 \u00b0C, which may be conducted in common solvents without \n\nprior purification (GRUBBS, 2004). In 2005, Robert H. Grubbs, Yves \n\nChauvin and Richard R. Schrock shared the Noble Prize in chemistry for \n\ntheir contributions to olefin metathesis (MATOS et al., 2007; \n\nFERREIRA; SILVA, 2005). \n\n \n\n2.2.1 ADMET polymerization \n \n\nThe development of Acyclic Diene Metathesis (ADMET) \n\npolymerizations, as for all metathesis reactions, has been closely linked \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\nto the development of catalysts presenting improved activity, selectivity \n\nand stability (MUTLU; MONTERO DE ESPINOSA; MEIER, 2011).  \n\nThe ADMET reaction has been intensively studied since \n\nWagener and colleagues (1990a; 1990b) reported the first examples of \n\nhigh molecular weight polymers obtained by polymerization of ?,?-\n\ndienes. This reaction follows a step-growth mechanism and it is driven \n\nby the release of a low molecular weight condensate, usually ethylene \n\n(Figure 7). This metathesis reaction produces well-defined and strictly \n\nlinear polymers with (modified) unsaturated polyethylene backbones\n \n\n(BAUGHMAN; WAGENER, 2005) and can only reach high molecular \n\nweights at high monomer conversion, like all traditional condensation \n\npolymerizations (MUTLU; MONTERO DE ESPINOSA; MEIER, \n\n2011). \n\n \nFigure 7. Schematic representation of an ADMET (Acyclic Diene METathesis) \n\npolymerization. \n\n \nSource: Adapted from MUTLU; MONTERO DE ESPINOSA; MEIER (2011). \n\n \n\nThe mechanism of the ADMET polymerization cycle is well \n\nestablished (Figure 8). The olefin coordinates to a metal-carbene \n\ncomplex, and then a cycloaddition reaction occurs forming a \n\nmetallacyclobutane intermediate (1). At this stage, the productive \n\ncleavage of the intermediate complex (1) leads to the formation of the \n\nalkylidene complex (2). A subsequent reaction with the double bond of \n\nanother diene produces a metallacyclobutane ring (3), which \n\nsubsequently leads to the polymer formation. The cycle continues with \n\nthe coordination of another diene or growing polymer, followed by \n\nproductive cleavage and release of ethylene. Once all the species \n\ninvolved in the catalytic cycle are in equilibrium, ethylene is generally \n\nremoved from the reaction medium by applying vacuum or using a \n\nconstant flow of an inert gas, such as argon or nitrogen, promoting the \n\npolymer formation (MUTLU, 2012). \n\nThe discovery and usage of the Schrock and Grubbs catalysts \n\npaved the way for the synthesis of polymers with different architectures \n\nand functionalities through ADMET reactions. For example, \n\napplications of the ADMET reaction enabled the development of \n\nsynthetic routes for obtaining perfectly linear polyethylenes and a wide \n\nrange of polyethylenes functionalized and branched with alkyl groups \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\nspecifically placed along their main chain (OPPER; WAGENER, 2011). \n\nGraft copolymers with \u201cperfect comb\u201d structures are also accessible via \n\npolymerizing ADMET (O\u2019DONNELL et al., 2001). \n \n\nFigure 8. ADMET polymerization mechanism. \n \n\n \n \n\nSource: Adapted from MUTLU; MONTERO DE ESPINOSA; MEIER (2011). \n\n \n\nRecently, Meier and coworkers (RYBAK; MEIER, 2008; \n\nMONTERO DE ESPINOSA et al., 2009; MUTLU et al., 2010; \n\nFOKOU; MEIER, 2010) investigated the synthesis and posterior \n\npolymerization of ?,?-diene monomers derived from vegetable oils. \n\nUsing 10-undecenoic acid (which is the major product of castor oil \n\npyrolysis) due to its terminal olefin, different types of ?,?-dienes were \n\nprepared and submitted to ADMET reactions for obtaining new \n\npolymeric structures. Thus, acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) reaction \n\nis a promising technique to obtain high molecular weight polymers from \n\nrenewable raw materials (WARWEL et al., 2001; MEIER; METZGER; \n\nSCHUBERT, 2007). \n\n \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\n2.3 THIOL-ENE REACTIONS \n \n\nThe first publication on addition of mercaptans to unsaturated \n\ncompounds was in 1905 when Posner noted that thiols and alkenes \n\ncould react spontaneously with each other or in the presence of an acid \n\n(POSNER, 1905). In 1926, thiol-ene reactions were presented as a \n\npolymerization reaction for the very first time, when Braun and Murjahn \n\nfound out that alkyl mercaptans spontaneously gelled upon heating \n\n(BRAUN; MURJAHN, 1926). However, the widespread polymerization \n\nmechanism mediated by free radicals, including the individual steps of \n\nthe reaction, was only elucidated by Kharasch, Read and Mayo (1938) \n\njust before the Second World War in 1938 (CLAUDINO, 2011). \n\nIn the half of the twentieth century, thiol-ene chemistry was a \n\nwidely used method for crosslinking polymers, but the technique fell out \n\nof favor due to the preference for high molecular weight polymers \n\nwhich were not covalently cross-linked (KADE; BURKE; HAWKER, \n\n2010). Currently, thiol-ene chemistry is especially used for the \n\nbiofunctionalization of polymers and particles/nanoparticles surfaces for \n\nbiomedical usages; however, there are several different applications \n\nsuch as UV curable resins, high impact absorption materials, electronic \n\ncoating and others (STENZEL, 2013; HOYLE; LEE; ROPER, 2004). \n\nThiol-ene reactions are based on easily abstractable hydrogens of \n\nthe thiol group due to the low energy of the sulfur-hydrogen bond \n\n(RS\n?\n\u2014H\n\n?+\n), 368.44 kJ.mol\n\n-1\n. It occurs because the electron-poor \n\nhydrogen atom is bonded to a sulfur atom, which is not as \n\nelectronegative as an oxygen atom of an alcohol group (for example, the \n\nenergy of the OH bond of a methyl alcohol (MeO\u2014H) is \n\n435.43 kJ.mol\n-1\n\n). Disruption of the S-H bond may occur through direct \n\nphotolysis or thermolysis, or indirectly via nucleophilic initiators which \n\ngenerate free radicals and chemically attack the thiol group; this bond \n\ncleavage generates electrophilic thiyl radicals (RS\u2022) which are extremely \n\nreactive and can be added to a wide diversity of unsaturated compounds. \n\nThe addition reaction, known as hydrothiolation of C=C bonds, is \n\nexothermic, typically between -10.5 and -22.6 kcal.mol\n-1\n\n, and \n\nenergetically favorable because a carbon-carbon ?-bond (~370 kJ.mol\n-1\n\n) \n\nis formed instead of a ?-bond, weaker (~235 kJ.mol\n-1\n\n) (HOYLE; \n\nBOWMAN, 2010). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\n2.3.1 Thiol-ene polymerization \n \n\nLike a traditional free-radical polymerization, thiol-ene \n\npolymerization reaction proceeds divided into three stages: initiation, \n\npropagation and termination, plus a chain transfer step (Scheme 1). \n\nFirstly occurs a thermal decomposition of the initiator in a pair of active \n\nradicals and the reaction of a thiol with an active radical produced, \n\nresulting in a primary radical RS? (I). Propagation involves a reaction \n\nbetween RS? and an alkene, generating an intermediary compound (II); \n\nthus, the intermediary compound abstracts a hydrogen from another \n\nmolecule of thiol (III), resulting in the thiol-ene addition product and a \n\nnew radical RS?. Termination (IV, V, VI) occurs through radical (RS? \n\nor carbon-centered radical) combination rather than dispropornation \n\n(CARLSON; KNIGHT, 1973).  \n\n \nScheme 1. Thiol-ene reaction steps: initiation (I), propagation (II), chain-\n\ntransfer step ( III) and termination (IV, V and VI).  \n \n\n \n \n\nSource: Author. \n\n \n\nFigure 9 presents the characteristic two steps mechanism of the \n\nthiol-ene polymerization reaction, divided into initiation, propagation \n\nand termination, as mentioned above. Firstly, the reaction begins with \n\nthe thiol decomposition into thiyl radicals through hydrogen abstraction, \n\nwhich can be induced by photo- or thermoinitiation with the aid or not \n\nof initiators. The resulting thiyl radical is then added to one of the \n\ndouble bonds of the diene (step I), generating an intermediary ?-carbon \n\nradical, followed by the chain transfer to a second thiol (step II), \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\nresulting in the primary product of the thiol-ene addition, which still \n\npossess a double bond available for the propagation of the polymer \n\nchain. Once the mechanism regenerates the thiyl radical, there is no \n\nconsumption of the thiol groups and, hence, the polymerization \n\ncontinues in a cyclic sequence. Termination reactions are often \n\nconsidered insignificant compared to the propagation rates and generally \n\ninvolve bimolecular combination of ?-carbon or thiyl radicals, although \n\nthese processes have not yet been fully elucidated (CLAUDINO, 2011). \n \n\nFigure 9. Propagation cycle of a thiol-ene polymerization: addition of a thiyl \n\nradical to a double bond (I); chain-transfer from a carbon-centered radical to a \n\nthiol-group. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nSource: Adapted from CLAUDINO (2011). \n\n \n\nThiol-ene addition kinetics is strongly influenced by the type of \n\nthe unsaturated compound (terminal, internal, conjugated, non-\n\nconjugated and substituted) and, depending on the thiol structure, the \n\nreactivity order can be slightly modified (HOYLE; BOWMAN, 2010; \n\nLOWE, 2010). Hoyle, Lee and Roper (2004) classified the reactivity of \n\ncertain unsaturated compounds in thiol-ene addition as follows: \n\nNorbornene > Vinyl ether > Propenyl > Alkene ~ Vinyl ester> N-Vinyl \n\namides > Allyl ether ~ Allyltriazine ~ Allylisocyanurate > Acrylate > \n\nUnsaturated ester > N-substituted maleimide > Acrylonitrile ~ \n\nmethacrylate > Styrene > Conjugated dienes. Additionally, it was found \n\nthat 1-hexene is 8 times more reactive than trans-2-hexene and 18 times \n\nmore reactive than trans-3-hexene, showing the strong effect of the \n\ndouble bond position in the alkene compound. \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\nOne of the most important advantages offered by the thiol-ene \n\nchemistry over classical free-radical polymerizations is the high ability \n\nto overcome oxygen inhibition. In the case of radical polymerization \n\nusing (meth)acrylates, the oxygen interacts with the radical of a growing \n\npolymer chain and the chain will immediately terminate due to the \n\nformation of an alkyl peroxy radical, which has insufficient reactivity to \n\ncontinue the propagation step, resulting in short chains fragments \n\n(HOYLE et al., 2003).  In turn, for thiol-ene polymerization reactions, \nthe formation of such radicals due to oxygen presence does not inhibit \n\nthe polymerization because peroxy radicals are capable of abstracting \n\nthe hydrogen from thiol groups and thus generate thiyl radicals, \n\ncontinuing the propagation step with new alkenes. Therefore, the \n\npresence of oxygen in thiol-ene reactions has only a minimal effect on \n\nthe main reaction route but does not affect their products (O'BRIEN; \n\nCRAMER; BOWMAN, 2006). As hydrogen donor groups, thiols can be \n\nadded (even in small amounts) to formulations with acrylic monomers to \n\nsuppress oxygen inhibition in the polymerization reaction, by trapping \n\nthe peroxy radicals.  \n\nAlthough known for over a century, thiol-ene addition reactions \n\nhave become very popular in the recent years due to their \"click\" \n\ncharacteristics, such as speed, robustness and efficiency, as well as low \n\nformation of by-products (HOYLE; BOWMAN, 2010). Even though the \n\nefficiency of this type of reaction requires terminal unsaturation and \n\nstrongly depends on the thiol used, polymerization reactions of ?,?-\n\ndienes with dithiols have been successfully applied in order to obtain a \n\nwide variety of new polymers (KREYE; TOTH; MEIER, 2011; \n\nT\u00dcR\u00dcN\u00c7; MEIER, 2012; 2013; FIRDAUS et al., 2014).  \nFor being an effective tool in several areas, used for \n\npolymerization, curing and polymer modification reactions, thiol-ene \n\nreactions may be considered as a versatile and efficient tool for the \n\nsynthesis of monomers and high added-value chemicals, and also for \n\nsynthesis and modification of polymers derived from fully renewable \n\n?,?-diene monomers bearing, for example ester, ether, or amide \n\nfunctional groups in the backbone chain (MACHADO; SAYER; \n\nARA\u00daJO, 2016). In addition, by using monomers with different \n\nfunctionalities, it is possible to tune some properties of the monomer, \n\nsuch as degradability, crosslinking, shrinkage stress and other physical \n\nfeatures.  \n\nDue to their electronically rich double bonds, vegetable oils and \n\nderivatives allow the radical addition of different types of molecules, \n\nespecially thiols (MUTLU, 2012). Examples of reactions between \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\nvegetable oils or derivatives and thiols are found in the literature, such \n\nas the synthesis of telechelic alcohols from 10-undecenoate allyl by \n\nthiol-ene addition with mercaptoethanol (LLUCH et al., 2010); the \nfunctionalization of methyl 10-undecenoate, a derivative of castor oil, \n\nwith mercaptoethanol or 1-thioglycerol (T\u00dcR\u00dcN\u00c7; MEIER, 2010); the \n\ncopolymerization of fatty acid derivatives with ferulic acid derived \n\ncompounds with 1,4-butanedithiol (KREYE; TOTH; MEYER, 2011), \n\nand others. \n\nApart from the already mentioned advantages, thiol-ene reactions \n\nare considered environmentally friendly because may be carried out \n\nwithout solvent, under mild reaction conditions (by photochemical \n\ninitiation, for example) and without using catalysts consisting of \n\npotentially toxic metal compounds, commonly employed in other \"click\" \n\nreactions (KADE; BURKE; HAWKER, 2010; HOYLE; LOWE; \n\nBOWMAN, 2010). In addition, biocompatible and biodegradable \n\npolymers can be synthesized through thiol-ene polymerization for \n\nbiomedical application (WANG et al., 2013; VANDENBERGH et al., \n\n2014; AMATO et al., 2015).  \n\n \n\n2.4 MINIEMULSION POLYMERIZATION \n \n\nOver the last years, miniemulsion polymerization has been \n\nearning importance and the development of innovative and more \n\naccessible polymeric materials obtained by this technique has become \n\nmore common due to the combination of some attractive advantages \n\nsuch as the absence of solvents, easier temperature control, and radical \n\ncompartmentalization inside the polymer particles (promoting high \n\npolymerization rates and allowing to obtain high molecular weight \n\npolymers) with the possibility of using and/or incorporating water-\n\ninsoluble reactants and compounds (EL-AASSER; MILLER, 1997; \n\nASUA, 2002; ANTONIETTI; LANDFESTER, 2002; SCHORK et al., \n\n2005), such as several vegetable oils (CARDOSO; ARAUJO; SAYER, \n\n2013).  \n\nMiniemulsions are characterized by a heterophase system in \n\nwhich submicrometric droplets (size ranging from 50 to 500 nm) of the \n\nmonomer phase (which are formed with the aid of high shear devices) \n\nare dispersed in a continuous phase, usually water. In these systems, the \n\nsmall droplets are protected against coalescence by using an appropriate \n\nsurfactant and the monomer diffusion can be controlled by the addition \n\nof a costabilizer (LANDFESTER et al., 1999; ASUA, 2002; \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\nLANDFESTER, 2006). A simplified schematic of the miniemulsion \n\npolymerization process is shown in Figure 10. \n \n\nFigure 10. Principle of miniemulsion polymerization. \n \n\n \n \n\nSource: Adapted from Landfester (2006). \n\n \n\nIn contrast to emulsion polymerization, that presents micellar \n\nnucleation, miniemulsion polymerization features droplet nucleation \n\nand, therefore, each droplet is the polymerization locus, acting like a \n\nbulk polymerization nanoreactor (UGELSTAD; EL-AASSER; \n\nVANDERHOFF, 1973). According to Asua (2002), not every droplet is \n\nnecessarily nucleated. Nevertheless, the fact that all or nearly all \n\ndroplets are nucleated allows the reduction or total elimination of the \n\nneed for mass transport of the monomer in the aqueous phase, featuring \n\nan important advantage of the miniemulsion polymerization process \n\ncompared to conventional emulsion.  \n\nIn addition to the droplets nucleation, other nucleation \n\nmechanisms may possibly occur, such as micellar and homogeneous \n\nnucleation. Therefore, miniemulsion systems require an evaluation of \n\nthe necessary parameters for the maximization of droplet nucleation. As \n\nmentioned by Asua (2002), if water-soluble initiators are used, the \n\ndroplets nucleation depends on a sequence of processes. First, there is \n\nradical formation in the aqueous phase by the initiator decomposition. \n\nDue to the high water solubility of the radicals, they are not able to enter \n\nthe monomer droplets or micelles. Thus, the radical polymerization \n\nstarts in the aqueous phase by monomer desorption from the droplets, \n\nresulting in oligomers. As the oligomers grow, they become more \n\nhydrophobic until they reach a critical length and then enter the \n\nmonomer droplets, characterizing the droplets nucleation, or even enter \n\nthe pre-existing micelles, the so-called micellar nucleation. If the radical \n\ngrows until it reaches a second critical size, further increasing its \n\nhydrophobicity and inhibiting its entry in the nanodroplets, this growing \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\noligomer precipitates, yielding a new particle and featuring a \n\nhomogeneous nucleation (GILBERT, 1995). \n\nIt is known that the surfactant concentration in miniemulsions \n\nshould be below the critical micelle concentration (CMC) in order to \n\nprevent the formation of micelles. In the absence of micelles, the \n\ndroplets nucleation depends only on the number of radicals which enters \n\nthe nanodroplets, whilst the resultant radicals precipitate in the aqueous \n\nphase (homogeneous nucleation). However, Hansen and Ugelstad \n\n(1979) observed that the presence of micelles also depends on the \n\nhomogenization process used. Using hexadecane as costabilizer and \n\napplying a low-intensity agitation, the authors reported the formation of \n\nlarge droplets of monomer, decreasing the total surface area of \n\nnanodroplets and, consequently, causing the presence of free surfactant \n\nin the aqueous phase, yielding micelles and favoring micellar \n\nnucleation. In contrast, increasing the dispersion intensity resulted in \n\nsmaller droplets and the absence of micelles. Therefore, it can be \n\nconcluded that micelles formation should be avoided combining proper \n\nhomogenization conditions and surfactant concentration below the CMC \n\nin the aqueous phase. \n\nThe nucleation mechanisms discussed to this point refer to \n\npolymerization in miniemulsion carried out with a water soluble \n\ninitiator, because when an organic-soluble initiator is applied, the \n\nnucleation of the monomer droplets is predominant, since the initiator is \n\nalready inside the drop. For this reason, organic-soluble initiators can \n\nreduce homogeneous nucleation and diffusional degradation \n\noccurrences, once the radicals are generated inside the droplets and there \n\nis no need for mass transfer of the monomer through the aqueous phase. \n\nHowever, the small volume of the nanodroplets limits the efficiency of \n\nthe hydrophobic initiator due to the higher probability of recombination \n\nof the newly formed radicals (AUTRAN; CAL; ASUA, 2007). \n\nOnce the miniemulsions are formed, there are two mechanisms \n\n(shown in Figure 11) which can change the number and size of the \n\ndroplets: diffusional degradation (Ostwald ripening) and coalescence \n\nbetween the droplets; and both can lead to the destabilization of the \n\nminiemulsion. Diffusional degradation is characterized by mass transfer \n\nof monomer from smaller to larger droplets and the coalescence occurs \n\nwhen two or more droplets are sufficiently close to permit their contact, \n\nthereby forming a single larger drop. \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\nFigure 11.  Coalescence and diffusional degradation schemes. \n\n \n\nSource: Author. \n\n \n\nTo avoid coalescence, an effective surfactant must be added, \n\npromoting electrostatic and/or steric stabilization of the droplets \n\n(CHOU; EL-AASSER; VANDERHOFF, 1980). According to El-Aasser \n\nand Miller (1997), surfactants must satisfy the following requirements: \n\n(i) their structure must have polar and non-polar groups; (ii) they must \n\nbe more soluble in aqueous phase and be readily available for adsorption \n\non the droplets surface, (iii) they must adsorb strongly and not be easily \n\ndisplaced when two droplets collide; (iv) they must be effective at low \n\nconcentrations; (v) they should be relatively inexpensive, non-toxic and \n\nsafe to handle. \n\nDiffusional degradation can be suppressed by the presence of a \n\nhydrophobic compound, called costabilizer, in the dispersed phase. \n\nAccording to Schork et al. (2005), the costabilizer retards the diffusion \nof monomer from smaller droplets to larger droplets and must have \n\ncharacteristics such as high solubility in the monomer, low solubility in \n\nwater and low molecular weight. Costabilizers cannot be able to diffuse \n\nthrough the aqueous phase from one droplet to another; therefore, a \n\ndifference in concentration of costabilizer inside the droplets, which \n\nincreases with decreasing droplet size, creates a counterforce upon \n\nmonomer diffusion. Thereafter, an osmotic pressure builds up and \n\ncounteracts the Laplace pressure responsible for diffusional degradation \n\n(ANTONIETTI; LANDFESTER, 2002; ASUA, 2002; LANDFESTER, \n\n2003; SCHORK et al., 2005). It is important to mention that the \nsurfactant and costabilizer choice is a very important factor for the \n\nminiemulsion formulation because these compounds remain in the final \n\npolymer and may have a negative effect on the properties of the \n\nresulting latex.  \n\nBesides many possibilities for radical polymerization reactions in \n\nminiemulsion systems, other polymerization routes can be adapted to be \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\nperformed in miniemulsion, ranging from anionic, cationic and \n\nenzymatic polymerization to polyaddition and polycondensation \n\n(LANDFESTER; MUSYANOVYCH; MAIL\u00c4NDER, 2010). \n\n \n\n2.4.1 ADMET and thiol-ene reactions in miniemulsion \n \n\nThere is a growing interest to perform metathesis and thiol-ene \n\nreactions in an aqueous phase aiming to work with an environmentally \n\nfriendly system, but only few works were reported. Additionally, \n\nbesides avoiding the use of organic solvents, the miniemulsion process \n\nenables the production of polymeric nanoparticles with unique \n\ncharacteristics and vast commercial interest - e.g. structured \n\nnanoparticles presenting different morphologies (LANDFESTER, \n\n2009): hollow, hybrid, well-defined microstructure, and nanocapsules \n\nfor inorganic solids\n \n(ROMIO et al., 2013; STAUDT et al., 2013) or drug \n\nencapsulation (BERNARDY et al., 2010).  \nPecher and Mecking\n\n \n(2007, 2010) performed aqueous \n\nminiemulsion polymerizations to obtain poly(phenylene-vinylene) \n\nconjugated nanoparticles by ADMET polymerization. This first attempt \n\non producing polymer nanoparticles by ADMET miniemulsion \n\npolymerization resulted in polymers with very low molecular weights, \n\nMn around 1.5kDa, using Grubbs 2\nnd\n\n generation and Hoveyda-Grubbs \n\n2\nnd\n\n generation as catalysts and the cationic surfactant DTAC \n\n(dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride) for colloidal stabilization of the \n\nnanodroplets/polymeric nanoparticles. Although producing polymers \n\nwith low molecular weights (below 2 kDa), these published studies have \n\nshown that carrying out metathesis reactions in miniemulsion may allow \n\nto obtain polymeric nanoparticles with microstructures inaccessible by \n\nother polymerization techniques (PECHER; MECKING, 2007). \n\nRecently, Lobry et al. (2014) and Jasinski et al. (2014) reported \n\nthe synthesis of poly(thioether) nanoparticles via thiol-ene reactions in \n\nminiemulsion using diallyl adipate and ethylene glycol dithiol as \n\ncomonomers. The reactions performed via photopolymerization yielded \n\npolymers presenting a glass transition temperature (Tg) of -63 \u00baC and a \n\nmelting temperature (Tm) of 18 \u00baC. Due to their high crystallinity, the \n\npolymers were insoluble in most of the organic solvents and, therefore, \n\nthe authors presented the molecular weight only for the soluble part \n\n(Mn = 30 kDa). \n\nAmato and coworkers (2015) also performed thiol-ene \n\nphotopolymerization reactions in miniemulsion in order to obtain cross-\n\nlinked poly(thioether) nanoparticles. The work investigated the effects \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\nof surfactant concentration, organic phase/water phase ratio and the \n\ninfluence of a costabilizer in the miniemulsion. Furthermore, non-\n\nstoichiometric thiol-ene polymerization reactions were performed and \n\nnanoparticles presenting either thiol or ene functional groups on the \n\nsurface were obtained. \n\nThe possibility of obtaining polymers containing water sensitive \n\nmoieties, such as polyesters, in aqueous dispersed medium is a great \n\nadvantage in performing ADMET and thiol-ene polymerization in \n\nminiemulsion. In addition, many other types of interesting materials \n\ncould be obtained, e.g. nanocomposites, nanocapsules and hybrid \n\nparticles. Moreover, polymers containing ester groups in the main chain \n\ncan undergo hydrolysis, enabling its degradation in physiological \n\nenvironment, which is of major importance for biomedical applications \n\nor even the polymeric material disposal. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\nCHAPTER III \n\nThis chapter is part of a publication entitled \u201cADMET reactions in \n\nminiemulsion\u201d published in the Journal of Polymer Science Part A: \n\nPolymer Chemistry, 52: 1300\u20131305, 2014. \n\n \n\n3 ADMET REACTIONS IN MINIEMULSION \n \n\n3.1 INTRODUCTION \n \n\nVegetable oils show a high potential as alternative resource for \n\nthe production of polymeric materials because of their renewability, \n\nworld wide availability, relatively low prices, and value added \n\napplication possibilities. These advantages make them very attractive for \n\nthe chemical industry, since their use could replace some petroleum \n\nbased compounds (BELGACEM; GANDINI, 2008; MONTERO DE \n\nESPINOSA; MEIER, 2011; MEIER, 2011; T\u00dcR\u00dcN\u00c7, MEIER, 2011). \n\nFurthermore, these renewable resources are considered to be very \n\nimportant for the production of biobased polymers due to, for example, \n\ntheir low toxicity and inherent biodegradability (BIERMANN et al., \n\n2000; SHARMA; KUNDU, 2006; LLIGADAS et al., 2010). \n\nVegetable oils primarily consist of triacylglycerols (triglycerides). \n\nFatty acids are 95% of the total weight of triglycerides and can be easily \n\nobtained by hydrolysis (or alcoholysis to obtain the respective esters). \n\nDepending on the fatty acid distribution, each type of oil has specific \n\nphysical and chemical properties. Fatty acids have been studied as \n\nrenewable building blocks for the synthesis of compounds with high \n\nadded value and specific properties. Furthermore, often only a few \n\nminor modification reactions have to be performed prior to their \n\napplication (MONTERO DE ESPINOSA; MEIER, 2011; G\u00dcNER; \n\nYA?CI; ERCIYES, 2006). \n\nSince many fatty acids are unsaturated, metathesis generally is a \n\nsuccessful and versatile tool to derivatise their double bonds in order to \n\nobtain new monomers and polymers (IVIN; MOL, 1997; MEIER; \n\nMETZGER; SCHUBERT, 2007; RYBAK; FOKOU; MEIER, 2008; \n\nMEIER, 2009; BIERMANN et al., 2011). In this context, the acyclic \n\ndiene metathesis (ADMET) reaction is a promising technique to obtain \n\nhigh molecular weight polymers from renewable raw materials (MEIER; \n\nMETZGER; SCHUBERT, 2007; RYBAK; FOKOU; MEIER, 2008; \n\nWARWEL et al., 2001; MUTLU; MONTERO DE ESPINOSA; \n\nMEIER, 2011; OPPER; WAGENER, 2011). The ADMET process has \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\nbeen intensively studied since Wagener et al. (1990a; 1990b) reported \n\nthe first examples of high molecular weight polymers obtained by \n\npolymerization of ?,?-dienes. ADMET polymerization follows a step-\n\ngrowth mechanism and is driven by the release of a low molecular \n\nweight condensate, usually ethylene. This metathesis reaction produces \n\nwell-defined and strictly linear polymers with (modified) unsaturated \n\npolyethylene backbones (BAUGHMAN; WAGENER, 2005) and can \n\nonly reach high molecular weights at high monomer conversion, like all \n\ntraditional condensation polymerizations (MUTLU; MONTERO DE \n\nESPINOSA; MEIER, 2011). Rybak et al. (2008) showed high molecular \n\nweight polymers (Mn up to 45 kDa) synthesized from undecylenyl \n\nundecenoate, a 100% castor-oil-derived monomer. \n\nThe synthesis of polymeric nanoparticles has been intensely \n\ninvestigated from a fundamental point of view to studies directed for \n\nspecific applications (MEHNERT; MADER, 2001; TIARKS; \n\nLANDFESTER; ANTONIETTI, 2001; LANDFESTER, 2006; \n\nPECHER; MECKING, 2007; CAPEK, 2010; LANDFESTER; \n\nMUSYANOVYCH; MAIL\u00c4NDER, 2010). Nanoparticles are frequently \n\nobtained by free radical polymerization, where an organic phase is \n\ndispersed in an aqueous phase. In heterophase polymerization \n\ntechniques, the synthesized polymer is not water-soluble and the \n\nmonomer presents low solubility in water. Emulsion polymerization is a \n\nvery well-established system used to synthesize polymeric \n\nnanoparticles.  \n\nOn the other hand, miniemulsion polymerization has been earning \n\nimportance in this field. The number of publications has increased and \n\nthe development of novel polymeric materials obtained by this \n\ntechnique has become more common due to the combination of some \n\nattractive characteristics from conventional emulsion polymerization \n\nand the possibility of using and/or incorporating water insoluble \n\nreactants and compounds (EL-AASSER; MILLER, 1997; ASUA, 2002; \n\nANTONIETTI; LANDFESTER, 2002; SCHORK et al., 2005), such as \nseveral vegetable oils (CARDOSO; ARAUJO; SAYER, 2013). \n\nTherefore, the miniemulsion process enables the production of \n\npolymeric nanoparticles with unique characteristics and vast commercial \n\ninterest - e.g. structured nanoparticles presenting different morphologies \n\n(LANDFESTER, 2009): hollow, hybrid, well-defined microstructure, \n\nand nanocapsules for inorganic solids (ROMIO et al., 2013; STAUDT et \n\nal., 2013) or drug encapsulation (BERNARDY et al., 2010). \n\nThere is a growing interest to perform metathesis reactions in an \n\naqueous phase aiming to work with an environmentally friendly system, \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n\nbut only few works were reported. For example, Lynn et al.(1996) \n\ninvestigated living ROMP reactions of norbornene derivatives in \n\naqueous emulsion and Pecher and Mecking (2007; 2010) performed \n\naqueous miniemulsion polymerizations to obtain poly(phe-\n\nnylenevinylene) conjugated nanoparticles by ADMET polymerization. \n\nThis first attempt on producing polymer nanoparticles by ADMET \n\nminiemulsion polymerization resulted in polymers with very low \n\nmolecular weight, 1.5 kDa, using Grubbs 2nd generation and Hoveyda-\n\nGrubbs 2nd generation as catalysts and a cationic surfactant \n\n(dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride, DTAC) for colloidal stabilization \n\nof the nanodroplets/polymeric nanoparticles. The absence of organic \n\nsolvents in ADMET reactions in miniemulsion afforded polymeric \n\nnanoparticles with microstructures inaccessible by other polymerization \n\ntechniques (PECHER; MECKING, 2007). \n\nTherefore, this Chapter aims to contribute to the study of \n\nADMET reactions in aqueous miniemulsion polymerization evaluating \n\ndifferent types of catalysts and different surfactants (anionic, cationic \n\nand non-ionic). A set of ADMET polymerizations of 1,3-propylene \n\ndiundec-10-enoate (Figure 12), a diester monomer derived from castor \n\noil, was used to evaluate the performance of different types of \n\nruthenium-based catalyst (Hoveyda Grubbs 2\nnd\n\n generation, Grubbs 1\nst\n \n\ngeneration and Umicore M2) and surfactants (sodium dodecyl sulfate - \n\nSDS, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide - CTAB, and Lutensol AT80, \n\nwhich is a C16C18 fatty alcohol ethoxylate with 80 ethylene oxide units). \n\n \nFigure 12.

After 20 min \n\nof magnetic stirring, 1 and 2 were sonicated separately (Branson \n\nUltrasonics Corp., Branson Digital Sonifier W450) for 1 min with an \n\namplitude of 60%, using a \u00bd\" tip. Then, the miniemulsions were mixed \n\nand sonicated again for 2 more minutes. An ice bath was used to reduce \n\nthe temperature increase during the sonication. In the case where bulk \n\nreactions were performed, monomer (1 g) and 1 mol% of the catalyst \n\nwere mixed at the reaction temperature.  \n\nFigure 15 shows the schematic representation of the procedure \n\nadopted for the miniemulsion reactions. At first, two different attempts \n\nwere performed adding the catalyst directly to the monomer before and \n\nduring the sonication. However, in both cases, the resulting \n\nminiemulsion was not stable. \n \n\nFigure 15.

The molecular weight distributions were determined relative to \n\nPMMA standards (Polymer Standards Service, Mp 1100 \u2013 981000 Da). \n\n \n\n3.2.6 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance \n \n1\nH NMR and \n\n13\nC NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 on \n\nBruker AVANCE DPX spectrometers operating at 300 and 600 MHz. \n\nChemical shifts (?) are reported in parts per million relative to the \n\ninternal standard tetramethylsilane (TMS, ? = 0.00 ppm).  \n\n \n\n3.2.7 Differential scanning calorimetry  \n \n\nDSC experiments were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere \n\n(30 mL min\n-1\n\n) at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min\n?1\n\n on a Mettler Toledo DSC \n\n823 calorimeter. The melting temperature, Tm, was recorded from the \n\nsecond heating ramp from -50 \u00baC to 180 \u00baC. \n\n  \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\n3.3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\nTo start our investigations, the ?,?-diene monomer 1,3-propylene \n\ndiundec-10-enoate was prepared by a procedure found in the literature \n\n(MUTLU et al., 2010b) using 1,3-propanediol, which can be prepared \n\nfrom glycerol by fermentation, and 10-undecenoic acid, a commercial \n\nderivative of castor oil and an important raw material for cosmetics, \n\npharmaceuticals, and polymeric compounds (MUTLU et al., 2010a).\n \n\nADMET polymerizations of the 100% renewable monomer were \n\nperformed to study the effect of the catalyst and the surfactant type at \n\ndifferent temperatures (45 and 85 \u00b0C), under miniemulsion (Mini) and \n\nbulk (B) conditions, after 6 h reaction time and the results are shown in \n\nTable 2.  \n\nThe reactions resulted in particle sizes in the range of \n\n150-350 nm, depending on the type of surfactant employed. The amount \n\nof SDS and CTAB were fixed to 0.3 wt.% related to water and the non-\n\nionic Lutensol was fixed to 3.0 wt.%. The weight fraction difference \n\nbetween the surfactants is due to the much higher molecular weight of \n\nLutensol AT80 (~3.8 kDa).When comparing the mole fraction of the \n\nsurfactants related to water, Lutensol and CTAB present almost the \n\nsame mol fraction, 0.014 and 0.015 mol%, respectively. Although SDS \n\npresented the higher mol fraction, 0.019 mol%, the stabilization of the \n\nmonomer droplets was less effective, with an average diameter around \n\n300 nm and highly disperse particle size distribution (PDI superior to \n\n0.2). SDS is usually a very effective surfactant, but our results indicate \n\nthat there was an interaction between the SDS and the catalyst HG2 \n\ndecreasing the stabilization efficiency of SDS and the catalyst activity. \n\nA first set of experiments (Table 2, entries 1 and 2) showed that \n\nno polymerization occurred when employing the HG2 catalyst in the \n\npresence of the anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at either 45 or \n\n85 \u00b0C. A similar behavior was observed by Pecher and Mecking (2007) \n\nusing SDS to polymerize 1,4-dipropoxy-2,5-divinylbenzene by ADMET \n\npolymerization in aqueous miniemulsion using Grubbs 2nd generation \n\nand HG2 as catalyst, where no polymerization occurred. It has also been \n\nreported by Lynn and coworkers (1996) that low yields of \n\npolynorbornene were produced by living ROMP using G1 as catalyst \n\nand the anionic surfactant SDS. Higher yields were achieved when \n\nchanging to the cationic surfactant DTAB (dodecyltrimethylammonium \n\nbromide) in this case.  \n\n \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\nTable 2.

However, lower \n\nmolecular weights were obtained when compared to a bulk reaction \n\n(Table 2, entry 5). It should be mentioned here that no efforts were taken \n\nto remove the ethylene from this bulk reaction (i.e vacuum or inert gas \n\nflow) in order to make the results more comparable to the miniemulsion \n\nreactions. Of course, much higher molecular weights can be achieved, if \n\nsuch experimental set-ups are chosen. In any case, these results may be \n\n\n\n58 \n\n \n\nattributed to partial HG2 catalyst decomposition in water (PECHER; \n\nMECKING, 2007). Increasing the reaction temperature from 45 to 85\u00b0C \n\nresulted in some increase in the molecular weight due the increased \n\ncatalyst activity (MUTLU et al., 2010b) \n\nThe effect of the catalysts type (G1, HG2, UM2) in miniemulsion \n\nwas investigated under similar conditions in terms of concentrations of \n\nreagents in the organic phase and temperature (Table 1, entries 4, 7 and \n\n10) using CTAB as surfactant. The molecular weight distribution was \n\nanalyzed by GPC (Figure 16). The number average molecular weight, \n\nMn, of the resulting polymer followed the order UM2 (~7 kDa) >> HG2 \n\n(~2 kDa) > G1 (~1 kDa). This result is in accordance with previous \n\nworks that showed that all indenylidene Ru-catalysts, like UM2, were \n\nmore robust under similar reaction conditions compared to their Ru-\n\nbenzylidene counterparts, like G1 and HG2 (MUTLU et al., 2010b; \nBURTSCHER et al., 2008; MONSAERT et al., 2008; ADEKUNLE et \n\nal., 2010). \n \n\nFigure 16. GPC traces of ADMET polymerizations in miniemulsion performed \n\nwith HG2 (P4), G1 (P7) and UM2 (P10) as catalyst and CTAB as surfactant. \n\n \n \n\nReactions using the non-ionic surfactant Lutensol AT80 with \n\ndifferent catalysts (Table 2, entries 6, 8 and 11) produced polymers with \n\nhigher molecular weight (Figure 17) by comparison to the reactions \n\nusing the same catalyst but with the cationic surfactant CTAB (Table 2, \n\nentries 4, 7 and 10; Figure 16). This effect is more pronounced when \n\ncomparing the polymers P10 (Mn= ~7 kDa) and P11 (Mn= ~15 kDa), \n\nobtained with CTAB and Lutensol AT80, respectively, and UM2 as \n\n\n\n59 \n\n \n\ncatalyst. The higher reactivity observed in the reactions with the non-\n\nionic surfactant indicates that the electronic charge of the surfactants \n\naffected the catalyst activity, although the cationic surfactant did not \n\ndeactivate the catalyst to the same extent as the anionic surfactant did.  \n\nDSC results (Figure 18) showed that polymer P11 (Table 2, entry \n\n11), obtained with UM2 and Lutensol AT80, exhibited a quite sharp Tm \n\npeak at 30.0 \u00b0C, indicating a higher structural regularity by comparison \n\nto polymer P10 (Table 2, entry 10), obtained with UM2 and CTAB, \n\nwhich presented a broader melting transition peak probably because of \n\nits broader molecular weight distribution with peaks of low molecular \n\nweight polymer. \n \n\nFigure 17. GPC traces of ADMET polymerizations in miniemulsion performed \n\nwith HG2 (P6) and UM2 (P11) as catalysts and Lutensol AT80 as surfactant. \n\n \n \n\nThe molecular weight of the reaction performed in miniemulsion \n\nusing the catalyst UM2 and Lutensol AT80 as surfactant (Table 2, entry \n\n11) was more than three times higher than the molecular weight of the \n\nreaction in bulk (Table 2, entry 12). Apparently, the much higher surface \n\narea of the organic phase in miniemulsion polymerization improved the \n\nrelease of the ethylene formed during the metathesis reaction from the \n\npolymer particles as the bulk reaction was performed without any \nattempt, such as vacuum or nitrogen flow, to remove the ethylene from \n\nthe reaction medium. Therefore, results showed that using Umicore M2 \n\nand the non-ionic Lutensol AT80 resulted in the highest molecular \n\nweight obtained in the present work.  \n\n \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \n\nFigure 18. DSC traces of ADMET polymers P10 and P11. \n \n\n \n \n\n3.4 CONCLUSION \n \n\nADMET reactions were successfully performed in miniemulsion. \n\nThe studied process produced polymers with weight average molecular \n\nweight up to 15 kDa (Mn), depending on the catalyst and the surfactant \n\nemployed. The Ru-indenylidene catalyst, UM2, has presented higher \n\nactivity in water by comparison to the Ru-benzylidene catalysts, G1 and \n\nHG2. In addition, the catalysts activity was significantly affected by the \n\ntype of the surfactant. The large surface area of the organic phase in \n\nminiemulsion probably enhanced ethylene removal from the reaction \n\nlocus, promoting ADMET polymerization and achieving higher \n\nmolecular weights than in bulk. Moreover, Umicore M2 catalyst and the \n\nsurfactant Lutensol AT80 were found to be the most suitable \n\ncombination for ADMET reactions in miniemulsion polymerization.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \n\nCHAPTER IV \n\nThis chapter is part of a publication entitled \u201cBiobased polymeric \n\nnanoparticles from castor oil derivatives by thiol-ene miniemulsion \npolymerization\u201d under submission. \n\n \n\n4 THIOL-ENE REACTIONS IN MINIEMULSION \n \n\n4.1 INTRODUCTION \n \n\nThiol-ene polymerization is considered as a click-chemistry \n\nreaction because it can be carried out under mild conditions and \n\nnormally provides a high yielding and generation of inoffensive by-\n\nproducts (HOYLE; LEE; ROPER, 2004; HOYLE; BOWMAN, 2010). \n\nIn addition, thiol-ene reaction has been shown as a versatile tool to \n\nproduce polymers from fully renewable ?,?-diene monomers bearing, \n\nfor example ester, ether, or amide functional groups in the backbone \n\nchain (FIRDAUS; MONTERO DE ESPINOSA; MEIER, 2011; \n\nT\u00dcR\u00dcN\u00c7, 2012; T\u00dcR\u00dcN\u00c7; MEIER, 2013).  \n\nThere is a growing interest in developing novel biomaterials \n\naiming applications in drug delivery systems, tissue engineering and \n\nenvironmental issues. In this context, thiol-ene reactions have been \n\nearning attention due to the improved mechanical properties, unique \n\ncrosslinking structure and tunable degradability behavior provided by \n\nthese click reactions (KADE; BURKE; HAWKER, 2010; HOYLE; \n\nLOWE; BOWMAN, 2010; REDDY; ANSETH; BOWMAN, 2005). \n\nMoreover, thiol-ene mechanism provides clean and environmentally \n\nharmless reactions, without using organic solvents and toxic metal \n\ncatalysts, which are commonly employed in other \"click\" reactions and \n\nalso in metathesis reactions (such as ADMET).  \n\nApart from the advantages already mentioned, thiol-ene reactions \n\nallow the synthesis of high molecular weight polyesters in aqueous \n\ndispersed medium and thereby are suitable for the production of \n\npolymeric nanoparticles containing ester groups in the main chain, \n\nwhich can undergo hydrolysis, enabling their degradation in \n\nphysiological environment, which is of great importance for biomedical \n\napplications or material disposal (JASINSKI et al., 2014; MACHADO; \n\nSAYER; ARA\u00daJO, 2016).  \n\nBesides avoiding the use of organic solvents, miniemulsion \n\npolymerization possesses some advantages over other types of \n\npolymerization such as bulk and solution polymerizations, because it \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \n\nyields products with low viscosity and therefore mass, heat and \n\nmomentum transfer is improved. Additionally, the miniemulsion process \n\nenables the production of polymeric nanoparticles with unique \n\ncharacteristics and vast commercial interest (EL-AASSER; MILLER, \n\n1997; ASUA, 2002; ANTONIETTI; LANDFESTER, 2002). Thiol-ene \n\nstep-growth polymerization in miniemulsion is being currently \n\ninvestigated and only a handful of articles have been published in the \n\nliterature (JASINSKI et al., 2014; LOBRY et al., 2014; AMATO et \nal., 2015; MACHADO et al., 2016). Furthermore, works portraying the \n\npolymerization of renewable monomers through thiol-ene \n\npolymerization in aqueous dispersed medium are still uncommon.  \n\nHerein, it is presented the synthesis and characterization of \n\npoly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles via thiol-ene polymerization in \n\nminiemulsion using a fully renewable ?,?-diene monomer (derived from \n\ncastor oil and glycerol). Furthermore, little is known about the reactivity \n\nof different diene monomers in thiol-ene reactions, especially in the \n\npresence of water. Thus, the goal of this chapter is to provide basic \n\ninformation regarding this matter.  \n\n \n\n4.2 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE \n \n\n4.2.1 Materials \n \n\n10-Undecenoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%), 1,3-propanediol \n\n(Sigma-Aldrich, 99.6%), p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (Sigma-\n\nAldrich, 98.5%), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), \n\n1,4-butanedithiol (Sigma-Aldrich, >97%), 2-mercaptoethyl ether \n\n(Sigma-Aldrich, 95%), 4-pentenoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, 97%), 1,7-\n\noctadiene (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%), Lutensol AT80 (BASF), which is a \n\nC16C18 fatty alcohol ethoxylate with 80 ethylene oxide units (molecular \n\nweight ca. 3.8 kDa). All materials were used as received. Distilled water \n\nwas used in all experiments.  \n\n \n\n4.2.2 Monomer synthesis \n \n\nThe 100% renewable ?,?-monomer 1,3-propylene diundec-10-\n\nenoate was  prepared following the procedure described in Chapter 3, \n\nsession 3.2.2.  \n\nFor the short ?,?-diene diester monomer, 4-pentenoic acid \n\n(27.0 g, 0.27 mol), 1,3-propanediol (8.4 g, 0.11 mol), p-toluenesulfonic \n\nacid (3 g, 0.0157 mol) and toluene (200 mL) were added to a round-\n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\nbottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a Dean-Stark \n\napparatus. The resulting mixture was heated to reflux and water was \n\ncollected as the reaction proceeded. Once the reaction was completed, \n\nthe reaction mixture was allowed to cool. Figure 19 shows a scheme of \n\nthe esterification reaction. After removing the toluene under reduced \n\npressure, the residue was filtered through a short pad of basic aluminium \n\noxide with hexane as eluent. Hexane was removed and the crude product \n\nwas dissolved in diethyl ether (200 mL) and washed two times with \n\nwater (200 mL). The organic fraction was dried over anhydrous MgSO4 \n\nand the solvent removed under reduced pressure. The desired product \n\nwas isolated in 62% yield (16.4 g) and analyzed by \n1\nH NMR (Figure 20) \n\nand \n13\n\nC NMR spectroscopy. \n\n \nFigure 19.

The organic \n\nphase was prepared mixing ?,?-diene monomer (1.0 g) and, if used, \n\norganic-soluble initiator (AIBN) under magnetic stirring until complete \n\ninitiator solubilization. The aqueous phase was added to the organic \n\nphase and, after 10 min of vigorous magnetic stirring (500 rpm), a pre-\n\nemulsion was obtained. Then the dithiol was added to the system (1:1 \n\ndithiol-to-diene molar ratio) with a micropipette and the mixture was let \n\nunder mild magnetic stirring (250 rpm) for 5 minutes. The final \n\nemulsion was sonicated for 2 minutes with amplitude of 60% in a pulse \n\nregimen (10 seconds of sonication, 2 seconds of pause), using a Branson \n\nDigital Sonifier model W450 and a \u00bd\" tip. An ice bath was used to \n\nreduce the temperature increase during the sonication.  \n\nFigure 21 shows the schematic representation of the procedure \n\nadopted for the miniemulsion reactions.  \n \n\nFigure 21.

After 3 h, the reactions mixtures were diluted in \n\nTHF and the residue was precipitated into cold methanol for polymer \n\nisolation by filtration and subsequent polymer analysis.  \n\n \n\n4.2.4 Particle Size Measurements \n \n\nIntensity average diameters of the polymer particles (Dp) and the \n\npolydispersity indexes (PDI) were measured by dynamic light scattering \n\n(DLS - Malvern Instruments, Zeta SizerNano S). The latex samples \n\nwere diluted approximately 1:15 with distilled water prior to DLS \n\nanalysis. \n\n \n\n4.2.5 Molecular weight  \n \n\nMolecular weight distributions were determined using a \n\nShimadzu SEC System LC-20 A equipped with a SIL-20A auto \n\nsampler, GPC pre-column PSS SDV analytical (5\u00b5m, 8\u00d750mm), main-\n\ncolumn PSS SDV analytical 10000 \u00c5 (5 \u00b5m, 8\u00d7300mm) and a RID-10A \n\nrefractive index detector in THF (flow rate 1 mL\u00d7min\n-1\n\n) at 50 \u00b0C. The \n\nmolecular weight distributions were determined relative to PMMA \n\nstandards (Polymer Standards Service, Mp 1100 - 981000 Da). \n\n \n\n4.2.6 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance \n \n1\nH NMR and \n\n13\nC NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 on \n\nBruker Ascend 600 spectrometer operating at 600 MHz. Chemical shifts \n\n(?) are reported in parts per million relative to the internal standard \n\ntetramethylsilane (TMS, ? = 0.00 ppm). Analyses were performed at the \n\nLaborat\u00f3rio de Resson\u00e2ncia Magn\u00e9tica Nuclear \u2013 LRMN, University of \n\nBras\u00edlia \u2013 UnB, Brazil. \n\n \n\n4.2.7 Differential scanning calorimetry  \n \n\nDSC experiments were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere \n\n(30 mL min-1) at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min\n?1\n\n on a Mettler Toledo DSC \n\n823 calorimeter. The melting temperature, Tm, was recorded from the \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \n\nsecond heating ramp, from -50 \u00baC to 180 \u00baC. \n\n \n\n4.2.8 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) \n \n\nParticle morphology characterization was performed by \n\nTransmission Electron Microscopy using a JEM-1011 TEM (100 kV). \n\nFor this analysis, the sample was diluted in distilled water down to \n\n0.01% of solids content and one single drop was placed on a carbon-\n\ncoated copper grid. Then the grid was dried under room conditions \n\novernight. These analyses were performed in the Laborat\u00f3rio Central de \n\nMicroscopia Eletr\u00f4nica (LCME), Federal University of Santa Catarina.  \n\n \n\n4.2.9 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) \n \n\nAttenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-\n\nFTIR) spectroscopy was performed on a Bruker spectrometer, model \n\nTENSOR 27, in the range of wavenumbers 4000-600 cm\n-1\n\n by \n\naccumulating 32 scans at a resolution of 4 cm\n-1\n\n. The polymer samples \n\nwere analyzed (as powder) in the Laborat\u00f3rio de Materiais (LABMAT) \n\nat the Mechanical Engineering Department of the Federal University of \n\nSanta Catarina. \n\n \n\n4.3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n \nTo start our studies, three different ?,?-diene monomers (M1, \n\nM2, M3) and two different dithiols (BDT and MEE) with different chain \n\nlengths and functional groups (Figure 22) were chosen to perform thiol-\n\nene polymerization reactions under miniemulsion and bulk conditions. \n\nM1 (1,7-octadiene) is commercially available and is obtained from non-\n\nrenewable resources. This monomer does not present any ester group \n\nand therefore the polymer derived from this monomer does not undergo \n\nhydrolysis. M2 and M3, both ?,?-diene diester monomers, were \n\nsynthesized by a esterification procedure using 1,3-propanediol; M2 was \n\nprepared using 4-pentenoic acid and M3, using 10-undecenoic acid.  \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\nFigure 22.

When using the \n\nmonomer 1,3-propylene dipent-4-enoate (B4, B5, and B6), reactions \n\npresented the same  behavior, resulting in Mn around 5 kDa, regardless \n\nof initiator concentration. On the other hand, reactions using 1,3-\n\npropylene diundec-10-enoate  (B7, B8, B9 and B10) showed  an  \n\nincrease  in  the molecular  weight when increasing the initiator \n\nconcentration (Figure 23). Generally, molecular weight in radical \n\npolymerization drifts to lower values with the increase in initiator \n\nconcentration (ODIAN, 2009); in thiol-ene polymerization, however, \n\nthis behavior was not observed. One possible reason is the unique \n\nmechanism of thiol-ene polymerization, based on two main steps: the \naddition of a thiyl radical across the ene double bond followed by the \n\nelectron transfer from the carbon centered radical to a thiol group. \n\nTherefore, molecular weight in thiol-ene polymerization is more likely \n\n\n\n69 \n\n \n\nto depend on functional group conversion than on initiator \n\nconcentration. \n \n\nFigure 23. GPC traces of poly(thioether-ester) samples obtained using monomer \n\nM3 under different concentrations of AIBN.  \n\n \n \n\nComparing the three monomers, only thiol-ene polymerization \n\nwith 1,3-propylene diundec-10-enoate (M3) had an increase in \n\nmolecular weight with the increase of initiator. This might be due to the \n\ndifference in kinetics intrinsically attained to different types of \n\nmonomeric structures. It is likely that the thiol-ene polymerization \n\nkinetics with both M1 and M2 monomers are faster than with monomer \n\nM3, and thus achieving in shorter reaction times, or lower initiator \n\namounts, high degrees of polymerization up to the maximum. At \n\nfunctional group conversion limit due to kinetic issues, such as low \n\nmobility of polymeric chains, there is no increase in molecular weight. \n\nThus possibly monomers M1 and M2 reached the degree of \n\npolymerization limit, the functional group conversion limit, regardless \n\ninitiator concentration, whilst monomer M3 possess a slower \n\npolymerization kinetics and presents an increase in degree of \n\npolymerization, i.e. molecular weight, with the increase of initiator \n\nconcentration. Polymers with monomer M3 reached higher molecular \n\nweight (Figure 24) because 1,3-propylene diundec-10-enoate has a \n\nhigher molecular weight (408.3 Da) than 1,7-octadiene(110.2 Da) and \n\n1,3-propylene dipent-4-enoate (240.3 Da) (see Figure 22). This \n\n\n\n70 \n\n \n\nexplanation based on the monomer\u2019s molecular weight can be further \n\nconfirmed when the polymerization reactions with monomers M1 and \n\nM2 are compared, even though there is only a slight difference in the \n\npolymers\u2019 molecular weight. \n\n \nFigure 24.GPC traces of poly(thioether) samples obtained using 0.5 mol% of \n\nAIBN and different types of diene monomers (M1, M2 or M3).  \n\n \n \n\nThe melting point (Tm) of polymeric samples was checked by \n\ndifferential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and results are displayed in \n\nFigure 25. As observed, the synthesized poly(thioether)s presented sharp \n\nmelting endotherms, a characteristic  of semicrystalline polymers, \n\nsimilar to other thioether containing polyesters. This phenomenon for \n\nthioether containing homopolyesters was already mentioned and \n\nattributed to melting and recrystallization processes occurring during the \n\ncalorimetric run (LOTTI et al., 2006). Figure 25 also reveals a variation \nof the Tm from 42 \u00baC to 72 \u00baC, depending on the diene monomer \n\ncopolymerized with 1,4-butanedithiol; the higher Tm of B9 is due to the \n\nlonger chain length of M3 (if compared to M1 and M2) and a more \n\nregular structure of the polymer (spacing of the ester groups), both \n\nallowing a better crystallization of B9. In addition, the polymers \nexhibited double melting endotherms revealing that the polymers first \n\nundergo a melting process causing an increase in chain mobility and \n\nleading to a crystallization, which is followed by a second melting (YU \n\net al., 1983; T\u00dcR\u00dcN\u00c7, MEIER, 2010). \n\n\n\n71 \n\n \n\nIt is important to mention that the glass transition temperature of \n\nthe polymers was not possible to observe by DSC analysis due to their \n\ncrystallinity; however, the Tg could be determined by relaxation methods \n\nsuch as dynamic mechanical and dielectric spectroscopies (FOCARETE \n\net al., 2001). \n\n \nFigure 25.

These \n\nresults are not shown herein because we only wanted to compare results \n\nwith the same formulation (without costabilizer). \n\nWhen M2 or M3 were employed, reactions resulted in particle \n\nsizes in the range of 114-290 nm, depending on the monomer used, and \n\npolydispersity index (PdI) around 0.2. Reactions using 1,3-propylene \n\ndipent-4-enoate (M2) presented larger average particle diameters due to \n\nits higher hydrophilicity (shorter carbon chain) compared to M3. \n\nAgain, thiol-ene polymerization with M3 presented an increase in \n\nmolecular weight with the increase of initiator concentration (Figure \n\n26), achieving its maximum Mn at the concentration of 1 mol% of AIBN \n(Mini 6) and turning to decrease when the amount of AIBN was further \n\nincreased to 1.5 mol% (Mini7).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n73 \n\n \n\nFigure 26. GPC traces of poly(thioether-ester) samples obtained using monomer \n\nM3 under different concentrations of AIBN in miniemulsion. \n\n \n \n\nContinuing the investigation, polymerization reactions of the \n\nfully renewable monomer M3 were carried out under new conditions, \n\nsuch as different types of surfactant (SDS or Lutensol AT80) and dithiol \n\n(1,4-butanedithiol and 2-mercaptoethyl ether), to evaluate the effect on \n\nmolecular weight distribution. The experiments in miniemulsion (shown \n\nin Table 5) resulted in particle sizes in the range of 114 \u2013173 nm and \n\npolydispersity index (PdI) below 0.2, depending on the surfactant \n\nemployed.  \n\nWhen comparing reactions using M3, BDT and 1 mol% of AIBN \n\nin bulk (B9) and miniemulsion (Mini6), it can be noticed similar results \n\nfor molecular weight (Mw = 33 kDa), evidencing that thiol-ene reactions \n\nin miniemulsion yielded comparable results to those in bulk. However, \n\nreaction Mini8, using Lutensol AT80, presented lower molecular weight \n\nthan reaction Mini6, using SDS; this result is probably due to the higher \n\naverage particles diameter (Dp) obtained using Lutensol as surfactant \n\n(173 nm), since an increase in the droplet size may increase bimolecular \n\ntermination probability due to the higher content of radicals inside the \n\ndroplet. In miniemulsion systems, radical compartmentalization allows \n\nfaster polymerization rates and higher molecular weights \n\n(LANDFESTER, 2003; COSTA et al., 2013); however, thiol-ene \n\nreactions not just depend on average number of radicals per particle but \n\nmostly on the stoichiometry (CRAMER et al., 2003). Therefore, radical \n\n\n\n74 \n\n \n\ncompartmentalization effect occurs only if the stoichiometric balance is \n\nnot impaired in the polymerization locus (MACHADO et al., 2016).  \n\n \nTable 5.

As mentioned before, thiol-ene polymerization is \n\nsensitive to variations in stoichiometry and thus molecular weight is not \n\nallowed to further increase.

Three different ?,?-diene monomers \n\n(1,7-octadiene, 1,3-propylene dipent-1-enoate and 1,3-propylene \n\ndiundec-10-enoate) and two different dithiols (1,4-butanedithiol and 2-\n\nmercaptoethyl ether) were evaluated and the results were compared. \n\nReactions yielded polymers with weight average molecular weight up to \n\n15.3 kDa (Mn), depending on the comonomers employed and the \n\n1 \u00b5m 1 \u00b5m \n\n1 \u00b5m 1 \u00b5m \n\n\n\n77 \n\n \n\ninitiator concentration. Additionally, AIBN (initiator) presented an ideal \n\nconcentration (1 mol %) to achieve higher molecular weight, a different \n\nbehavior of the observed in traditional free radical polymerization. \n\nMoreover, the synthesized poly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles derived \n\nfrom renewable resources present potential degradability properties \n\n(hydrolysable bonds in the main chain) and biocompatibility; therefore, \n\nthe (bio)degradation of these particles and cytotoxicity/biocompatibility \n\ntests should be performed for future biomedical applications. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n79 \n\n \n\nCHAPTER V \n\n \n\n5 OXIDATION OF POLY(THIOETHER) TO POLYSULFONE \nNANOPARTICLES \n\n \n\nThis chapter is part of a publication entitled \u201cOxidation of \n\nPoly(thioether) to Polysulfone Nanoparticles\u201d, under submission. \n\n \n\n5.1 INTRODUCTION \n \n\nThiol-ene \u201cclick\u201d reactions can be effectively used in a large \n\nnumber of applications, ranging from synthetic processes for basic \n\nchemical synthesis to the fabrication of a wide range of polymeric \n\nmaterials and new applications, including optical displays, nano-\n\nimprinting, holographic diffractive materials, microfluidic devices, high-\n\nimpact energy-absorbing devices, complex surface patterns, optical \n\nswitching arrays, and functionalized linear polymers. However, \n\napplications requiring materials with high glass transition temperature \n\n(Tg), such as dental restoratives, optical components and automotive/ \n\naerospace repair resins, are not readily achievable using most traditional \n\nthiol\u2013ene combinations, since thioether-linkages are characterized by \n\nflexible sulfide bonds (LI, 2007; CARIOSCIA et al., 2007; HOYLE; \n\nBOWMAN, 2010).  \n\nTherefore, easy post polymerization modification of polymer \n\nbackbones appears as an important and challenging concept in polymer \n\nscience. Hydrophobic thioether can be oxidized to more polar sulfoxide \n\nor sulfone derivatives (POTAPOV et al., 2011). The presence of polar \nsulfone groups in polymer backbones generates interesting properties \n\ndue to the strong interactions between sulfone groups (dipole moment of \n\n4.5 Da). The high polarity of these functional groups tends to increase \n\nthe Tg and thermal stability of the material, leading to a modified \n\npolymer surface energy with improved adhesion characteristics, \n\npaintability or pigment wetting (VAN DEN BERG et al., 2013). \n\nFurthermore, sulfone groups present in polymer chains can also lead to \n\nliquid crystallinity (ZHANG 1994). \n\nBecause of the very low dipole moment of thioethers, these \n\ncompounds are generally hydrophobic; upon oxidation, they are \n\nconverted to high-dipole-moment sulfoxides and/or sulfones, leading to \n\nan increase in affinity towards water (VO; KILCHER; TIRELLI, 2009). \n\nTherefore, oxidation could act as a trigger that converts a material from \n\nhydrophobic to hydrophilic. Thus, due to the associated morphological \n\n\n\n80 \n\n \n\ntransitions promoted, such as the swelling of a polymer network or the \n\nsolubilization of individual macromolecules, poly(sulfone) nanoparticles \n\ndispersed in a hydrophilic solvent could be used for releasing \n\nencapsulated bioactive compounds or for uncovering groups capable of \n\nspecific interactions with cells (JASINSKI et al., 2016).  \n\nSo far, Rehor, Tirelli and Hubbell (2002, 2005) studied the \n\nsynthesis of oxidation responsive poly(thioether) nanoparticles through \n\nemulsion ring-opening polymerization of propylene sulfide. Recently, \n\nJasinski and coworkers (2016) reported the synthesis and application of \n\npoly(thioether-ester) latexes via thiol-ene miniemulsion \n\nphotopolymerization. The combination of thioether and ester bonds in \n\nthe same polymer backbone could provide nanoparticles potentially \n\nsensitive to oxidation and hydrolysis, acting as dual-stimuli-responsive \n\nnanocarriers (JASINSKI et al., 2016). \nAmong the different oxidants and catalysts useful for the \n\noxidation of thioethers, hydrogen peroxide is known as the most \n\nversatile and environmentally friendly. Furthermore, the oxidation of \n\nsensitive sulfides by hydrogen peroxide usually proceeds under \n\nrelatively mild conditions and, in several cases, only a small excess of \n\nH2O2 is required (NOYORI; AOKI; SATO, 2003; POTAPOV et al., \n\n2011). In addition, due to its solubility in water, hydrogen peroxide is \n\nvery suitable for oxidizing poly(thioether) particles dispersed in aqueous \n\nmedia (JEANMAIRE et al., 2014).   \n\nHerein, it is presented the post polymerization oxidation of \n\npoly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles, synthesized in Chapter IV, using a \n\nhydrogen peroxide solution, a well-known process to oxidize the sulfur \n\natom successively to sulfoxide and sulfones. Morphology and thermal \n\nproperties of the oxidized polymers were analyzed and compared to the \n\noriginal polymers (before oxidation). Furthermore, FTIR spectra of the \n\nsamples were evaluated to verify the structure of the obtained materials. \n\n \n\n5.2 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE \n \n\n5.2.1 Materials \n \n\nPolymeric samples from reaction Mini6, obtained previously in \n\nChapter IV. Hydrogen peroxide solution (35 wt.%, Sigma-Aldrich), \n\nsodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) and sodium \n\nbicarbonate (Vetec, 99,7%). All materials were used as received. \n\nDistilled water was used in all experiments.  \n\n \n\n\n\n81 \n\n \n\n5.2.2 Oxidation procedure \n \n\nFor solid polymer samples (previously precipitated in methanol), \n\n0.2 g of polymer was dissolved in chloroform (20 mL) and, \n\nsubsequently, hydrogen peroxide solution (35 wt.%, 0.6 mL) was added \n\nto the reaction flask (S-OXI). \n\nFor latex samples, 2 g of miniemulsion (0.2 g of polymer, \n\napproximately) was mixed with 6g of a SDS solution (0.25 wt.% in \n\nwater) and then 0.6 mL of hydrogen peroxide solution (35 wt.%) was \n\nadded dropwise (L-OXI). \n\nAfter 3 h of reaction at 64 \u00b0C, the formed polymer was \n\nprecipitated in a methanol\u2013water (60:40) mixture. The precipitated \n\npolymer was then washed successively with sodium bicarbonate \n\n(100 mL), water (100 mL), and methanol (100 mL) prior to drying in a \n\nvacuum oven at room temperature. The procedure adopted was found in \n\nthe literature (VAN DEN BERG et al., 2013). \n \n\n5.2.3 Particle Size Measurements \n \n\nIntensity average diameters of the polymer particles (Dp) and the \n\npolydispersity indexes (PdI) were measured by dynamic light scattering \n\n(DLS - Malvern Instruments, Zeta SizerNano S). The latex samples \n\nwere diluted approximately 1:15 with distilled water prior to DLS \n\nanalysis. \n\n \n\n5.2.4 Differential scanning calorimetry  \n \n\nDSC experiments were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere \n\n(30 mL min-1) at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min\n?1\n\n on a Mettler Toledo DSC \n\n823 calorimeter. The melting temperature, Tm, was recorded from the \n\nsecond heating ramp, from -50 \u00baC to 180 \u00baC. \n\n \n\n5.2.5 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) \n \n\nAttenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-\n\nFTIR) spectroscopy was performed on a Shimadzu spectrometer, model \n\nIRprestiage-21, in the range of wavenumbers 4000-400 cm\n-1\n\n by \n\naccumulating 32 scans at a resolution of 4 cm\n-1\n\n. The polymer samples \n\nwere analyzed as mulls, prepared by mixing the polymer with dry KBr \n\npowder and pressing into a transparent KBr pellet. \n\n \n\n\n\n82 \n\n \n\n5.2.6 Thermogravimetric Analyses (TGA) \n \n\nThermal decomposition was studied by thermogravimetric \n\nanalysis (TGA, STA 449 F3 Jupiter, NETZSCH). Approximately 10 mg \n\nof each sample was weighed in a platinum pan and heated from 50 \u00baC to \n\n800\u00b0C, at a heating rate of 5 \u00baC min\n-1\n\n, under a nitrogen flow rate of 20 \n\nmL/min.    \n\n \n\n5.2.7 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) \n \n\nParticle morphology characterization was performed by \n\nTransmission Electron Microscopy using a JEM-1011 TEM (100 kV). \n\nFor this analysis, the sample was diluted in distilled water down to \n\n0.01% of solids content and one single drop was placed on a carbon-\n\ncoated copper grid. Then the grid was dried under room conditions \n\novernight. These analyses were performed in the Laborat\u00f3rio Central de \n\nMicroscopia Eletr\u00f4nica (LCME), Federal University of Santa Catarina.  \n\n \n\n5.3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\nAiming to modify the backbone of the polythioether samples \n\nsynthesized in Chapter IV and thus obtain materials with different \n\nproperties, the thioether-linkages of the polymer chains were oxidized to \n\nsulfones and sulfoxide linkages, using hydrogen peroxide solution. In \n\nthe process, 4 eq. of hydrogen peroxide (in relation to the sulfur function \n\nin the polymer chain) was used. In order to compare the oxidation \n\nprocesses for the nanoparticles and for the polymers obtained in bulk, \n\none aliquot of the latex obtained from reaction Mini6 (Mn=15.3 kDa; \n\nChapter IV) was precipitated in cold methanol, the polymer was \n\nsolubilized in chloroform and oxidized in solution (S-OXI), while other \n\naliquot was oxidized in latex (aqueous miniemulsion) form (L-OXI), i.e. \n\nwithout polymer precipitation. After 3 hours of reaction, the resultant \n\nmaterials were precipitated in methanol and purified prior to \n\ncharacterization analyses. One aliquot of the latex material (L-OXI) was \n\nreserved for DLS and TEM measurements. \n\nDLS measurements assured the stability of the latex after \n\noxidation, showing that the particles size remained at 140 nm \n\n(PDI = 0.13). Figure 30 displays the Particle Size Distribution (PSD) for \n\nthe nanoparticles before (Mini6) and after (L-OXI) oxidation. Also, \n\nFigure 31 shows TEM images of the oxidized latex (L-OXI) confirming \n\n\n\n83 \n\n \n\nthat the morphology of the nanoparticles was maintained even after the \n\noxidation process.  \n\n \nFigure 30.

It can be noticed a thermal \n\ninstability around 250 \u00baC for the oxidized polymers, which did not \n\nhappen with the non-oxidized polymer (Mini 6). This behavior probably \n\noccurred due to the cracking of the sulfoxide groups to sulfenic acid and \n\nalkene (LEE; LITT; ROGERS, 1998). Thus, in order to further verify \n\nthe degradation of the oxidized polymers, sample L-OXI was submitted \n\nto thermal decomposition up to 250 \u00baC (for 30 min, under nitrogen flow) \n\nand the product was analyzed by FTIR (Figure 34). The thermal \n\ninstability at 250 \u00baC of the sulfoxide groups was confirmed by the \n\nreduction of the peak observed in 1022 cm\n-1\n\n (sulfoxide specific IR \n\nabsorption) and the intensification of the peaks in 3450 cm\n-1 \n\n(O-H \n\nstretch; indicating the sulfenic acid formation) and 1640 cm\n-1\n\n (C=C \n\nstretch; evidencing the alkene formation). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n85 \n\n \n\nFigure 33.

FTIR spectra of the oxidized polymer L-OXI and its form after \n\nthermal decomposition up to 250 \u00baC (L-OXI-250). \n\n \n \n\nThe oxidation process resulted in a significant increase of the \n\npolymers melting temperature (Tm) from 73 \u00baC to around 132 \u00b0C (Figure \n\n35). Both methods, oxidation in solution (S-OXI) or latex (L-OXI), \n\npresented similar results, corroborating the success of the oxidation \n\n\n\n86 \n\n \n\nprocess for the nanoparticles in aqueous miniemulsion. In addition, it \n\ncan be noticed that oxidized polymers presented broader peaks in \n\ncomparison to the sample before oxidation; such behavior is attributed \n\nfor the recrystallization of different crystal forms in polar polymeric \n\nmaterials (VAN DEN BERG et al., 2013). \n \n\nFigure 35. DSC traces of poly(thioether) samples without oxidation (Mini6) and \n\noxidized in solid form (S-OXI) and latex (L-OXI). \n \n\n \n \n\nAs expected, all the oxidized polymeric samples were no longer \n\nsoluble in any solvent tested, including THF; therefore, it was not \n\npossible to determine their molecular weights by GPC. Moreover, other \n\nanalyses, such as tensile testing and AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy), \n\nmust be performed in future works for further characterization of the \n\nobtained polymers and biocompatibility and cytotoxicity tests of the \n\nmodified nanoparticles should be evaluated for future biomedical \n\napplications.  \n \n\n5.4 CONCLUSION \n \n\nHerein, poly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles, previously obtained \n\nthrough thiol-ene reactions in miniemulsion, were modified by post-\n\npolymerization oxidation of the thioether groups. A well-established \n\nprocess to oxidize the sulfur atom was performed using a hydrogen \n\nperoxide solution. For comparison of the results, the polymeric samples \n\n\n\n87 \n\n \n\nwere submitted to oxidation in latex and solution forms. FTIR \n\nmeasurements assured the appearance of sulfoxide and sulfone groups \n\nafter the oxidation and TGA-analyses showed a thermal instability \n\naround 250 \u00baC, which was attributed to the sulfoxide groups and \n\nconfirmed by FTIR. The melting temperature (Tm) of the oxidized \n\npolymers increased to 132 \u00baC and broader melting peaks were observed, \n\nprobably due to the recrystallization of different crystals in polar \n\npolymeric materials. In addition, the size/dispersion stability and \n\nmorphology of the nanoparticles after oxidation was confirmed by DLS \n\nand TEM images. Lastly, oxidized nanoparticles obtained herein present \n\nhigh potential for the release of bioactive compounds and, therefore, \n\nbiocompatibility/cytotoxicity analyses should be performed for future \n\nbiomedical applications. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n89 \n\n \n\nCHAPTER VI \n\n6 CITOTOXICITY AND BIOCOMPATIBILITY OF THE \nPOLY(THIOETHER-ESTER) NANOPARTICLES \n\n \n\n6.1 INTRODUCTION \n \n\nPolymeric nanoparticles have been earning significant attention \n\nas drug carriers due to many advantages, such as protective effect \n\nagainst drug degradation, controlled or sustained release, possibility of \n\ndrug delivery within the target tissue, and reduction of side effects (DE \n\nJONG; BORM, 2008; FELICE et al., 2014; FEUSER et al., 2016). In \nthis field, miniemulsion polymerization allows the synthesis of \n\npolymeric NPs with unique characteristics and great commercial \n\ninterest, with the possibility of using and/or incorporating drugs with \n\nlow solubility in the continuous phase for a wide range of applications. \n\nFurthermore, miniemulsion polymerization is a versatile technique and \n\npresents some attractive advantages such as easier temperature control \n\nand radical compartmentalization inside the polymer particles \n\n(promoting high polymerization rates and allowing to obtain high \n\nmolecular weight polymers) (EL-AASSER; MILLER, 1997; ASUA, \n\n2002; ANTONIETTI; LANDFESTER, 2002; SCHORK et al., 2005; \nCARDOSO; ARAUJO; SAYER, 2013).  \n\nIn this context, biobased polymers obtained from vegetable oils \n\npresent potential biodegradability and biocompatibility, allowing their \n\napplication for biomedical purposes. Thiol-ene reactions appear as \n\nsuccessful and versatile techniques to obtain high molecular weight \n\npolymers from renewable raw materials, affording products with \n\nimproved mechanical properties, unique crosslinking structure and \n\ntunable degradability behavior (KADE; BURKE; HAWKER, 2010; \n\nHOYLE; LOWE; BOWMAN, 2010). In addition, thiol-ene reactions \n\nallow the synthesis of polyesters in aqueous dispersed medium and \n\nthereby are suitable for the production of polymeric nanoparticles \n\ncontaining ester groups in the main chain, which can undergo \n\nhydrolysis, allowing their degradation in physiological environment, \n\nwhich is of great importance for biomedical applications or material \n\ndisposal (JASINSKI et al., 2014). However, little attention has been \n\npaid to the synthesis of biocompatible and biodegradable polymers \n\nthrough thiol-ene polymerization. Studies regarding the use of thiol-ene \n\nbased polymeric nanoparticles in the biomedical field, portraying \n\n\n\n90 \n\n \n\nbiocompatibility and biodegradation, are still underexplored (ZOU et \n\nal., 2011; MACHADO; SAYER; ARA\u00daJO, 2016).  \n\nThereby, the goal of this study was to characterize the biobased \n\npoly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles synthesized in Chapter IV, focusing \n\non future biomedical applications. Biocompatibility assays were \n\nperformed in murine fibroblast (L929) cells and human cervical cancer \n\ncells (HeLa). Morphological analyses of the cells were carried out by \n\ninverted microscopy. Additionally, the effect of the nanoparticles in \n\nnormal red blood cells (RBC) was verified by hemolysis assay. \n\n \n\n6.2 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE \n \n\n6.2.1 Biocompatibility assay on L929 (murine fibroblast) cells \n \n\nThe L929 cell lines were selected to evaluate cytotoxicity as a \n\ndirect contact test, as recommended by ISO 10993 for in vitro toxicity. \nThe cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s medium \n\n(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 \n\nunits/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/mL), and 4 mM/L of glutamine at \n\n37 \u00b0C in tissue culture flasks with 5 % CO2. For experimental purposes, \n\ntrypsinized cells were adjusted to a concentration of 1x10\n4\n cells plated \n\nin a 96-well flat bottom culture plate. For the cytotoxicity study, the \n\ncells were incubated for 24 h (5% CO2, 37 \u00b0C) in five different \n\nconcentrations (25, 50, 75, 100 and 200 \u00b5g/mL) of the polymeric \n\nnanoparticles (PTEE-N) dispersed in PBS 7.4. After 24 h of incubation \n\nthe nanoparticles were washed three times with PBS (phosphate \n\nbuffered saline) and cell viability was assessed using the classical MTT \n\nassay (Sigma, MO, USA). \n\n \n\n6.2.2 Cytotoxicity assay on HeLa (human cervical cancer cells) \n \n\nHeLa cell lines were obtained from the Adolfo Lutz Institute (S\u00e3o \n\nPaulo). HeLa cells were grown in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) \n\ncontaining 7.5% fetal bovine serum and maintained at 37 \u00b0C in a \n\nhumidified incubator containing 5% CO2. The HeLa cells were seeded \n\nat 1x10\n4 \ncells/well in a 96-well flat bottom culture plate. After 24 h, the \n\ncells were incubated with a medium containing polymeric nanoparticles \n\n(PTEE-N) dispersed in PBS 7.4 at five concentrations: 25, 50, 75, 100 \n\nand 200 \u00b5g/mL (5% CO2, 37 \u00b0C). After 24 h of incubation the cells were \n\nwashed three times with PBS (7.4) and the MTT cell viability assay was \n\n\n\n91 \n\n \n\nperformed.  The cytotoxicity assay was carried out in triplicate, with \n\nthree wells for each condition. \n\n \n\n6.2.3 MTT viability assay \n \n\nThe MTT cell proliferation assay was employed to assess cell \n\nviability after both cytotoxic assays. Briefly, 200 ?L aliquots of MTT \n\nsolution (5 mg.mL\n?1\n\n) were added to each well and incubated for 3 h \n\n(37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2), to allow the formazan-formation reaction. \n\nFollowing incubation, the medium containing the MTT solution was \n\nremoved and the formazan crystals were dissolved in DMSO. The \n\nabsorbance was measured at 550 nm using an Infinite 200 TECAN \n\nmicroplate reader. The results are presented as survival percentage \n\n(100%), where the control group contained 1% DMSO (v/v). \n\n \n\n6.2.4 Morphological analyses \n \n\nMorphological analyses, consistent with observation of changes \n\nin cells morphology, were carried out by inverted microscopy (40X). \n\nCells were incubated with poly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles (PTEE-N) \n\nat the concentration of 50 \u00b5g/mL. As negative controls, cells were \n\nanalyzed without incubation (control group). The morphological \n\nchanges of the cells were observed 24 h after the incubation. \n \n\n6.2.5 Hemolysis Assay \n \n\nIn order to analyze the effect of nanoparticles in normal red blood \n\ncells (RBC), five human blood samples were collected according to the \n\nethics committee requirements (CEPSH n\u00b0 913/2010). Briefly, 4 mL of \n\nwhole blood was added to 8 mL of a sterile solution of sodium chloride \n\nin water (saline) and the RBCs were isolated from serum by \n\ncentrifugation at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 5 min.  The RBCs were further washed \n\nfive times with saline solution, after that, the RBCs were diluted in 2 mL \n\nof saline solution. Then 120 \u00b5L of the diluted RBC suspension was \n\nadded to 880 \u00b5L of water or saline. Samples were incubated with \n\npolysulfone nanoparticles (PS-N) at a concentration of 50, 100 and \n\n200 \u00b5g/mL. All samples were prepared in triplicate and the suspension \n\nwas briefly vortexed before undergoing a gentle stirring at 37 \u00b0C for \n\n60 min. Afterwards, the mixture was briefly vortexed again and \n\ncentrifuged at 10.000 \u00d7 g for 5 min. 100 ?L of supernatant was \n\ntransferred to a 96-well plate. The absorbance value of hemoglobin at \n\n\n\n92 \n\n \n\n570 nm was measured with the reference wavelength at 540 nm. 120 \u00b5L \n\nof the diluted RBC suspension incubated with 880 \u00b5L of water and \n\nsaline were used as the positive and negative control, respectively \n\n(WANG et al., 2009; YU; MALUGIN; GHANDEHARI; 2011). \n\nHemolysis percentage was calculated according to Eq. 1: \n \n\n?????????

One-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni post hoc \n\ntest were used to compare the cytotoxicity of the samples at different \n\nconcentrations. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical \n\nPackage for Social Sciences for Windows (SPSS Inc. version 13.0, \n\nUSA). The statistical significance level was set at p &lt;0.05 for all \n\nanalyses.  \n \n\n6.3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\nCytotoxic effects of the synthesized poly(thioether-ester) \n\nnanoparticles (PTEE-N; Mini6 from Chapter IV) were evaluated by \n\nMTT assay on HeLa and L929 cells. Figure 36 and Figure 37 show the \n\ncytotoxicity profiles of HeLa and L929 cells, respectively, incubated \n\nwith different concentrations of PTEE-N nanoparticles. It could be \n\nobserved that the nanoparticles did not present any cytotoxic effect.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n93 \n\n \n\nFigure 36.

(p &lt;0.05 compared to \n\ncontrol group, using ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni post hoc test). \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n94 \n\n \n\nAdditionally, Figure 38 shows that there were no significant \n\nchanges in cell morphology after the incubation with PTEE-N \n\nnanoparticles on HeLa (a) and L929 (b) cells. The non-cytotoxicity of \n\nthe L929 cells is an important factor; ISO 10993-5 recommends in vitro \n\ncytotoxicity assay of new materials for biomedical application. \n\nAccording to ISO 10993-5, cell viability &lt;70% compared to untreated \n\ncells are considered cytotoxic (MADERUELO; ZARZUELO; LANAO, \n\n2011). Therefore, after the observed results, it can be said that \n\npoly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles obtained in this work are \n\nbiocompatibles.  \n\n \nFigure 38.

(Magnification 40X). \n \n\n  \n\n  \n \n\nMoreover, the impact of the poly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles \n\n(PTEE-N) on human red blood cells (RBCs) was evaluated by \n\nhemolysis assay (Figure 39). The quantification of hemoglobin in the \n\nsupernatant of the nanoparticle-RBC mixture was done by recording the \n\nabsorbance of hemoglobin at 540 nm. Treatments with 50 \u00b5g/L, 100 \n\n\u00b5g/L and 200 \u00b5g/L were not able to cause hemolysis of RBCs, \n\n\n\n95 \n\n \n\nsuggesting that these systems do not have hemolytic capacity, even \n\nwhen administered at high concentrations. These results reveal that \n\nPTEE-N nanoparticles have high blood biocompatibility, making them a \n\npotential alternative to carry drugs intravenously. \n\n \nFigure 39. Hemolysis assay.

The presence of hemoglobin in the supernatant (red) was observed at 540 \n\nnm. Data are mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3).  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n        \n\n \n6.4 CONCLUSION \n\n \n\nThis work has demonstrated that the synthesized poly(thioether-\n\nester) nanoparticles (PTEE-N) derived from renewable resources did not \n\npresent any cytotoxic effect in murine fibroblast cells (L929) and human \n\nC+ C- \n50  \n\n\u00b5g/mL \n\n100 \n\n\u00b5g/mL \n \n\n200  \n\n\u00b5g/mL \n \n\n\n\n96 \n\n \n\ncervical cancer cells (HeLa). Also, it was observed no significant \n\nchanges in cell morphology after the incubation with PTEE-N on HeLa \n\nand L929 cells, confirming the biocompatibility of the poly(thioether-\n\nester) nanoparticles and assuring their viability for biomedical purposes. \n\nIn addition, hemolysis assays revealed that PTEE-N nanoparticles have \n\nhigh blood biocompatibility, making them a potential alternative as drug \n\ncarrier systems for intravenous applications. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n97 \n\n \n\nCHAPTER VII \n\n7 FINAL CONSIDERATIONS \n \n\n7.1 CONCLUSION \n \n\nIn this work, the synthesis and characterization of a 100% \n\nrenewable diene-diester monomer derived from 10-undecenoic acid (a \n\ncastor oil derivative) and 1,3-propanediol (derived from glycerol) was \n\nreported. This green monomer was submitted to ADMET and thiol-ene \n\npolymerization reactions in miniemulsion aiming the development of \n\nbiobased polymeric nanoparticles.  \n\nADMET reactions were successfully performed in miniemulsion \n\nand the obtained polymers achieved weight average molecular weight \n\nup to 14.7 kDa (Mn), depending on the catalyst and the surfactant \n\nemployed. It was observed that the Ru-indenylidene catalyst (Umicore \n\nM2) presented higher activity in water by comparison to the Ru-\n\nbenzylidene catalysts (Grubbs 1\nst\n and Hoveyda-Grubbs 2\n\nnd\n), \n\ncorroborating previous results from the literature concerning the higher \n\nrobustness of indenylidene catalysts. Additionally, the catalysts activity \n\nwas significantly affected by the type of the surfactant, depending on its \n\nelectronic charge. Moreover, ADMET reactions in miniemulsion \n\nfavored the production of polymers with higher molecular weights than \n\nin bulk, probably because of the large surface area of the organic phase \n\nin miniemulsion, which causes the improvement of the ethylene removal \n\nfrom the reaction locus. \n\nAlso, thiol-ene polymerization reactions in miniemulsion were \n\nsuccessfully performed and poly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles \n\n(confirmed by TEM analyses) were obtained from the fully renewable \n\ndiene-diester monomer. Three different ?,?-diene monomers (1,7-\n\noctadiene, 1,3-propylene dipent-1-enoate and 1,3-propylene diundec-10-\n\nenoate) and two different dithiols (1,4-butanedithiol and 2-\n\nmercaptoethyl ether) were tested and the results were compared. \n\nReactions yielded polymers with number average molecular weight up \n\nto 15.3 kDa (Mn), depending on the comonomers employed and the \n\ninitiator concentration. Moreover, the initiator AIBN presented an ideal \n\nconcentration (1 mol %) to synthesize polymers with higher molecular \n\nweight, differing from the expected behavior in traditional free radical \n\npolymerization. Furthermore, the synthesized nanoparticles from \n\nrenewable raw materials present properties (such as hydrolysable bonds \n\nin the polymeric main chain) that could enhance their degradability and, \n\n\n\n98 \n\n \n\ntherefore, the (bio) degradation of these particles will be investigated for \n\nfuture applications. \n\nThereafter, the poly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles were modified \n\nby a post-polymerization reaction using hydrogen peroxide in order to \n\noxidize their sulfur atom to sulfoxide and sulfone groups. DLS and TEM \n\nimages assured the stability of size/dispersion and morphology of the \n\nnanoparticles even after the oxidation process. FTIR and TGA analyses \n\nconfirmed the presence of sulfoxide and sulfone groups after the \n\noxidation. The melting temperature (Tm) of the oxidized polymers \n\nincreased from 73 \u00baC to 132 \u00baC and broader melting peaks were \n\nobserved, attributed to the recrystallization of different crystals in polar \n\npolymers.  \n\nFinally, since the biobased polymeric nanoparticles obtained \n\nherein present high potential for the release of bioactive compounds, \n\nbiocompatibility/cytotoxicity analyses were performed and results \n\nrevealed that the synthesized nanoparticles did not present any cytotoxic \n\neffect and showed high blood biocompatibility, assuring their viability \n\nfor biomedical purposes. \n\n \n\n7.2 FURTHER WORK \n \n\n?

To further investigate the kinetics of thiol-ene reactions, in order \nto explain the ideal concentration of AIBN for improved \n\nmolecular weight; \n\n?
