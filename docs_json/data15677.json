Larval dispersal is crucial in the \n\nunderstanding of population dynamics and connectivity, which have important implications in \n\nthe design and maintenance of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).  The marking of calcified \n\ntissues with the antibiotic tetracycline is a frequently used methodology in scientific studies, \n\nand in the past decades it has been used to study population connectivity through larval \n\ndispersal. The main goal of this work was to validate the procedure for tetracycline tagging of \n\nthe otoliths of embryos of two gobiesocid species found in the Portuguese coast: Lepadogaster \n\npurpurea and Lepadogaster lepadogaster. This meant determining what would be the \n\nminimum tetracycline concentration needed to mark the larvae\u2019s otoliths with an immersion \n\ntime of only 30 minutes, and to assess if these immersions had any effect on the larvae\u2019s \n\nsurvival rates. For this purpose, eggs, in the pigmented-eye stage, were immersed for 30 \n\nminutes in different concentrated tetracycline solutions, in order to determine the appropriate \n\nconcentration for successful marking of otoliths. In addition, the possible effects of tetracycline \n\nin larvae\u2019s survival rates were also analyzed. Observation of otoliths of larvae of different ages, \n\nunder a fluorescence microscope, showed a high percentage of autofluorescence, both in \n\ncontrol and treatment samples, with no otoliths being considered as truly marked. Comparison \n\nof results from 30-minutes immersions and longer ones indicate that for this tagging \n\ntechnique, the immersion time also plays a key role, having the 2 and 15-hours immersions \n\nproduced positively- tagged otoliths. However, after statistical analysis, no correlation \n\nbetween the different tetracycline treatments and the levels of mortality was found, indicating \n\nthat this immersion in tetracycline solutions for a time period of 30 minutes had no effect on \n\nthe larvae\u2019s survival rates.  \n\nKey Words: Gobiesocidae, larvae, tetracycline marking, otoliths, larval dispersal \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\niv \n \n\n  \n\n\n\nv \n \n\nResumo \n\nRecentemente, cada vez mais aten\u00e7\u00e3o tem sido dada \u00e0 problem\u00e1tica da perda da \n\nbiodiversidade dos ambientes marinhos, assim como da deple\u00e7\u00e3o dos stocks de pesca. Uma \n\nsolu\u00e7\u00e3o encontrada \u00e9 a cria\u00e7\u00e3o de Zonas Marinhas Protegidas (ZMP). Por\u00e9m, para uma \n\ncorrecta cria\u00e7\u00e3o e manuten\u00e7\u00e3o destas zonas, \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio um profundo conhecimento da \n\ndin\u00e2mica existente entre as popula\u00e7\u00f5es locais. \n\nA conectividade entre popula\u00e7\u00f5es \u00e9 geralmente definida como a liga\u00e7\u00e3o demogr\u00e1fica existente \n\nentre popula\u00e7\u00f5es atrav\u00e9s da dispers\u00e3o de indiv\u00edduos sob a forma larvar. O n\u00edvel de \n\nconectividade entre popula\u00e7\u00f5es determina se estas ser\u00e3o consideradas como \n\ndemograficamente \u201cabertas\u201d ou \u201cfechadas\u201d. \n\nA maioria dos organismos marinhos possui um ciclo de vida bipartido, constitu\u00eddo por uma \n\nfase dispersiva, normalmente sob forma larvar pel\u00e1gica, e uma fase bent\u00f3nica, que geralmente \n\nse refere \u00e0 fase adulta da vida do indiv\u00edduo. A fase dispersiva desempenha um papel fulcral na \n\nconectividade entre popula\u00e7\u00f5es, sendo que a grande maioria da dispers\u00e3o se d\u00e1 nesta fase de \n\nvida. Assim sendo, \u00e9 muito importante para uma correcta constru\u00e7\u00e3o e manuten\u00e7\u00e3o das ZMP \n\num bom conhecimento das liga\u00e7\u00f5es existentes entre as popula\u00e7\u00f5es locais atrav\u00e9s da dispers\u00e3o \n\nlarvar. \n\nTradicionalmente, as larvas de organismos marinhos eram consideradas como part\u00edculas \n\npassivas, n\u00e3o tendo qualquer papel activo sobre a sua dispers\u00e3o, sendo que esta era \n\nmaioritariamente ditada pelo seu Per\u00edodo Larvar Pel\u00e1gico e pelas correntes oce\u00e2nicas \n\nsuperficiais. Assim sendo, os estudos de dispers\u00e3o larvar eram bastante mais simples, \n\nbastando uma an\u00e1lise dos padr\u00f5es das correntes oce\u00e2nicas superficiais para se ter uma ideia \n\nda conectividade entre popula\u00e7\u00f5es. \n\nPor\u00e9m, avan\u00e7os recentes nos estudos de gen\u00e9tica e comportamento larvar revelam que as \n\npopula\u00e7\u00f5es n\u00e3o s\u00e3o t\u00e3o demograficamente abertas como era de esperar se as larvas tivessem \n\num papel completamente passivo na sua dispers\u00e3o. Estes estudos permitiram concluir que as \n\nlarvas desenvolvem capacidades que lhes permitem escolher a sua direc\u00e7\u00e3o, contrariar as \n\ncorrentes locais, e selecionar um habitat para assentar, tendo assim um papel activo na sua \n\ndistribui\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nPor conseguinte, os estudos de dispers\u00e3o larvar assumem uma complexidade que \n\nanteriormente n\u00e3o tinham. Com o objectivo de estudar a conectividade entre as popula\u00e7\u00f5es \n\natrav\u00e9s da dispers\u00e3o larvar, in\u00fameras metodologias de marca\u00e7\u00e3o foram desenvolvidas. Estas \n\nt\u00e9cnicas de marca\u00e7\u00e3o podem envolver marcas naturais ou artificiais.  \n\nDe entre as marcas naturais podem contar-se as marcas gen\u00e9ticas, que contam com a \n\nheterogeneidade gen\u00e9tica naturalmente presente nas popula\u00e7\u00f5es selvagens, ou as marcas \n\ngeoqu\u00edmicas, cuja identifica\u00e7\u00e3o se baseia nas assinaturas isot\u00f3picas deixadas nos tecidos \n\ncalcificados dos indiv\u00edduos pelas caracter\u00edsticas fisico-qu\u00edmicas das diversas massas de \u00e1gua \n\nque atravessam durante a sua vida. \n\n\n\nvi \n \n\nJ\u00e1 as marcas artificias, mais amplamente aplicadas, podem utilizar variados compostos \n\nqu\u00edmicos, desde os compostos fluorescentes, que ser\u00e3o utilizados neste trabalho, aos is\u00f3topos \n\nradioactivos est\u00e1veis que s\u00e3o transmitidos \u00e0s larvas por via materna. \n\nEste estudo fez uso do composto qu\u00edmico tetraciclina. Este composto qu\u00edmico pode ser \n\nadministrado de v\u00e1rias formas aos indiv\u00edduos marcados. No presente trabalho que consistiu na \n\nmarca\u00e7\u00e3o de ovos de peixe, o m\u00e9todo de marca\u00e7\u00e3o escolhido foi a imers\u00e3o das posturas em \n\nsolu\u00e7\u00f5es com diferentes concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de tetraciclina. Este composto deposita-se nos tecidos \n\ncalcificados dos indiv\u00edduos, como os ot\u00f3litos, os quais s\u00e3o depois visualizados sob uma luz \n\nfluorescente, onde assumem o aspecto de um anel brilhante. A metodologia de imers\u00e3o difere \n\nde estudo para estudo, sendo mais frequente uma imers\u00e3o mais prolongada numa solu\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\ntetraciclina com uma concentra\u00e7\u00e3o reduzida.  \n\nO principal objectivo deste trabalho consistiu no desenvolvimento de uma metodologia de \n\nmarca\u00e7\u00e3o dos ot\u00f3litos das larvas destas esp\u00e9cies atrav\u00e9s da imers\u00e3o numa solu\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\ntetraciclina. Uma vez que esta metodologia tem como objectivo ser aplicada directamente no \n\ncampo, na zona de entre-mar\u00e9s, durante a mar\u00e9 baixa, o tempo de imers\u00e3o ideal seria de 30 \n\nminutos. Neste sentido, foram testadas imers\u00f5es de 30 minutos em solu\u00e7\u00f5es com v\u00e1rias \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00f5es de tetraciclina, de maneira a determinar qual a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00ednima \n\nnecess\u00e1ria para efectivamente marcar os ot\u00f3litos das larvas. Paralelamente, o efeito da \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o de tetraciclina na mortalidade das larvas foi avaliado. \n\nEste trabalho teve como objecto de estudo duas esp\u00e9cies de Gobiesocidae frequentemente \n\nencontradas na costa Portuguesa: Lepadogaster purpurea (Bonaterre, 1788) e Lepadogaster \n\nlepadogaster (Bonaterre, 1788). Estas esp\u00e9cies s\u00e3o morfologicamente muito semelhantes, \n\ndiferindo apenas nas \u00e9pocas reprodutivas (L. purpurea reproduz-se durante o Inverno e L. \n\nlepadogaster durante a Primavera). Possuem uma distribui\u00e7\u00e3o que vai desde a costa sul da \n\nEsc\u00f3cia, no Mediterr\u00e2neo at\u00e9 ao Senegal. A ecologia destas esp\u00e9cies est\u00e1 muito parcamente \n\nestudada, provavelmente devido ao seu pequeno tamanho e ao seu habitat cr\u00edptico, por baixo \n\nde rochas em praias de seixos rolados.  \n\nAs recolhas de ovos e adultos de L. purpurea (recolhas de Janeiro a Mar\u00e7o) e L. lepadogaster \n\n(de Mar\u00e7o a Junho) foram realizadas na praia de Alpertuche, localizada no Parque Marinho \n\nLuiz Saldanha, na Arr\u00e1bida. Ap\u00f3s recolha, os ovos e adultos foram levados para as instala\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nlaboratoriais no Instituto Superior de Psicologia Aplicada (ISPA) em Lisboa, onde foram \n\nmantidos em aqu\u00e1rios. Ap\u00f3s o estudo concluido, todos os adultos e juvenis sobreviventes \n\nforam libertados no local de recolha. \n\nAs posturas foram imersas em tetraciclina quando os ovos atingiram um estado de \n\ndesenvolvimento em que era j\u00e1 poss\u00edvel reconhecer os olhos dos embri\u00f5es pigmentados, pois \n\n\u00e9 nesta fase que os ot\u00f3litos iniciam a sua forma\u00e7\u00e3o. Para L. purpurea foram realizadas \n\nimers\u00f5es de 30 minutos em solu\u00e7\u00f5es com as seguintes concentra\u00e7\u00f5es: 400 mg.L\n-1\n\n; 600 mg.L\n-1\n\n; \n\n800 mg.L\n-1\n\n; 1000 mg.L\n-1\n\n e 1400 mg.L\n-1\n\n. Adicionalmente, v\u00e1rias larvas rec\u00e9m-eclodidas foram \n\nimersas em solu\u00e7\u00f5es de tetraciclina com 1000 mg.L\n-1\n\n durante 1, 2 e 15 horas para efeitos de \n\ncontrolo positivo, e desta forma avaliar visualmente a marca de fluoresc\u00eancia. No caso de L. \n\nlepadogaster foram realizadas imers\u00f5es de 30 minutos com as seguintes concentra\u00e7\u00f5es: 600 \n\n\n\nvii \n \n\nmg.L\n-1\n\n; 800 mg.L\n-1\n\n e 1000 mg.L\n-1\n\n. Para ambas as esp\u00e9cies, v\u00e1rias posturas foram deixadas sem \n\ntratamento a fim de servirem como grupos controlo. \n\nAp\u00f3s marca\u00e7\u00e3o, as posturas foram colocadas em aqu\u00e1rios separados, onde eclodiram e as \n\nlarvas foram desenvolvidas. As larvas foram sacrificadas em diferentes estados de \n\ndesenvolvimento, e conservadas em etanol a 96% a fim de posteriormente se extra\u00edrem os \n\not\u00f3litos para observa\u00e7\u00e3o ao microsc\u00f3pio. Diariamente o n\u00famero de larvas vivas em cada \n\ntratamento e cada replicado foram contabilizadas, para avalia\u00e7\u00e3o de taxas de mortalidade. \n\nDepois da extrac\u00e7\u00e3o, os ot\u00f3litos foram montados em l\u00e2minas e observados num microsc\u00f3pio \n\nde fluoresc\u00eancia. Os ot\u00f3litos do controlo positivo foram observados, de maneira a que uma \n\ncaracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o da marca fluorescente pudesse ser realizada a fim de ser comparada com os \n\nresultados das outras observa\u00e7\u00f5es. Ap\u00f3s observa\u00e7\u00e3o e dependendo do aspecto da sua marca \n\nfluorescente, os ot\u00f3litos foram classificados em tr\u00eas categorias diferentes: 0 (\u201cSem \n\nfluoresc\u00eancia\u201d), 1/0 (\u201cMarca n\u00e3o n\u00edtida\u201d ou \u201cCom Autofluoresc\u00eancia\u201d) e 1 (\u201cMarca N\u00edtida\u201d). O \n\ntratamento com maior percentagem de ot\u00f3litos classificados como 1 seria considerado o \n\ntratamento \u00f3ptimo. \n\nEm termos de efici\u00eancia de marca\u00e7\u00e3o dos ot\u00f3litos, as imers\u00f5es de 30 minutos revelaram-se \n\ninfrut\u00edferas, n\u00e3o tendo nenhum ot\u00f3lito ficado marcado, independentemente da esp\u00e9cie e da \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o aplicada. Por\u00e9m, quando se comparou os resultados das imers\u00f5es de tempos \n\ndiferentes em solu\u00e7\u00f5es com 1000 mg.L\n-1\n\n, observou-se um melhoramento da qualidade da \n\nmarca fluorescente com o aumento do tempo de imers\u00e3o. Ou seja, pode-se concluir que, para \n\nestas esp\u00e9cies, o sucesso de uma marca\u00e7\u00e3o de ot\u00f3litos de larvas atrav\u00e9s da imers\u00e3o de \n\nposturas em solu\u00e7\u00f5es de tetraciclina n\u00e3o depende s\u00f3 da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o da solu\u00e7\u00e3o, mas \n\ntamb\u00e9m do tempo de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o.  \n\nPor\u00e9m, n\u00e3o foi encontrada nenhuma rela\u00e7\u00e3o estatisticamente significativa entre as imers\u00f5es \n\nde 30 minutos e as diferentes taxas de mortalidade dos respectivos grupos. Assim sendo, \n\np\u00f4de-se concluir que imers\u00f5es de 30 minutos em solu\u00e7\u00f5es de tetraciclina at\u00e9 1400 mg.L\n-1\n\n n\u00e3o \n\nafectam as taxas de mortalidade de L. purpurea, e imers\u00f5es de 30 minutos em solu\u00e7\u00f5es com \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00f5es at\u00e9 1000 mg.L\n-1\n\n n\u00e3o t\u00eam efeito sobre as taxas de mortalidade de L. \n\nlepadogaster. \n\nOs resultados sugerem, desta forma, que imers\u00f5es de apenas 30 minutos n\u00e3o marcaram os \n\not\u00f3litos de larvas de L. purpurea nem de L. lepadogaster. Para o sucesso da marca\u00e7\u00e3o ser\u00e3o \n\nnecess\u00e1rios tempos de imers\u00e3o mais prolongados. Estudos futuros que testem diferentes \n\nm\u00e9todos de marca\u00e7\u00e3o de larvas dever\u00e3o ser levados a cabo. \n\nPalavras-chave: Gobiesocidae, larvas, marca\u00e7\u00e3o com tetraciclina, ot\u00f3litos, dispers\u00e3o larvar \n\n   \n\n\n\nviii \n \n\n  \n\n\n\nix \n \n\nIndex \n\nAcknowledgements ........................................................... i \nAbstract ............................................................................ iii \nResumo ..............................................................................v \nIndex ................................................................................. ix \nIntroduction ..................................................................... 1 \nMaterials and Methods \n\nCollection and handling of breeding adults and eggs ............................................................... 9 \nExperimental design and tetracycline marking ....................................................................... 10 \nLarval rearing and sampling .................................................................................................... 10 \nOtolith extraction, preparation and analysis .......................................................................... 11 \n\n     Data Analysis ........................................................................................................................... 12 \n\nResults \nTetracycline marking ............................................................................................................... 13 \n\nPositive control otoliths ...................................................................................................... 13 \nTreatment otoliths .............................................................................................................. 14 \n\n Classification of samples ..................................................................................................... 18 \n     Mortality rates ........................................................................................................................ 20 \n\nDiscussion ....................................................................... 23 \nReferences ...................................................................... 29 \n\n \n\n    \n\n\n\nx \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n1 \n \n\nIntroduction \n\nImpact of human activities on fishing stocks and natural populations has been a \n\npressing matter for quite some time, gaining more and more attention by scientists, \n\npoliticians and the general public in the past few years (Sale et al., 2005; Cowen, 2007; \n\nJones et al., 2007). The establishment of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) has been \n\npointed as a solution to contradict the global decline of fishery resources and \n\nbiodiversity (Sale et al., 2005; Leis, 2006; Mora et al., 2006; Cowen et al., 2007; Jones \n\net al., 2007). In order to correctly define the boundaries of these MPAs, a profound \n\nknowledge of the connectivity between local populations is needed.  \n\nPopulation connectivity usually refers to \u201cthe demographic linking of local populations \n\nthrough the dispersal of individuals among them as larvae, juveniles or adults\u201d (Sale et \n\nal., 2005). The levels of connectivity among local populations will determine whether \n\nthey function as essentially isolated, \u2018\u2018almost closed\u2019\u2019 populations, or as a \n\nmetapopulation, with the separate dynamics of individual populations being buffered \n\nby subsidy of recruitment from other populations (Sale 2004).  \n\nTherefore, the effectiveness of MPA\u2019s as management tools is highly dependent on the \n\nscale of demographic connectivity of local populations. If the populations resident in \n\nthe MPA are effectively open, they will be dependent on populations located in other \n\nareas to be seeded with new recruits. This way, the MPA\u2019s populations may be \n\nvulnerable to events outside its borders and as a result, might not fulfill its biodiversity \n\nand conservation roles (Leis, 2006; Jones et al., 2007). However, the MPA may still be \n\nsuccessful in fulfilling its fishery replenishment role if it exports propagules into the \n\nopen populations of its associated fish species, thereby providing recruits to fished \n\nareas outside its borders. In contrast, if the fish populations of a MPA are largely self-\n\nrecruiting (closed), then because it supplies most of its own young, the MPA should be \n\nable to fulfill its biodiversity role, but not a fishery replenishment role (it exports few \n\npropagules, thus the scale of demographic connectivity is too small) (Leis, 2003). A \n\nthird MPA may fulfill both roles by having a moderate degree of self recruitment, yet \n\nstill be exporting large numbers of propagules to fished areas (Leis &amp; Carson-Ewart, \n\n2003).  \n\n \n\nThe vast majority of marine organisms have a complex life cycle involving a change \n\nbetween a dispersive stage and a relatively sedentary benthonic life stage (McCormick \n\n&amp; Makey, 1997; Roberts, 1997; Leis, 2002; Leis, 2006; Pineda et al., 2007). This is the \n\ncase with marine reef fishes. Their life cycles are bipartite, being composed of a \n\ndispersive pelagic larval stage and a sedentary benthonic adult stage (Leis, 2002; Jones \n\net al., 2009). \n\n\n\n2 \n \n\nThe pelagic larval phase plays an extremely important role in population dynamics and \n\nconnectivity, fact that has been recognized since early last century (Hjort, 1926 and \n\nThorson, 1946 in Levin, 2006). In order to stipulate reserve location, size and spacing, it \n\nis very important to understand how different areas are connected through larval \n\nexchange, which populations serve as source and which serve as sinks (Levin, 2006). \n\nTherefore, there\u2019s a general consensus on the importance of understanding fish \n\npopulation dynamics and connectivity in designing and maintaining MPAs (Jones et al., \n\n2005; Levin, 2006; Roy, 2008; Jones et al., 2009), in order to maximize the protection \n\nto the nursery areas that provide larvae to the surrounding locations. \n\nTo fully understand larval dispersal and population connectivity, one needs to (1) \n\nunderstand the biological and hydrodynamic processes involved in the transport of \n\nlarvae and (2) derive larval origins and dispersal pathways using geochemical, genetic \n\nor artificial markers (Cowen et al., 2007).  \n\nThe time spent by the larvae in the pelagic environment is usually referred to as the \n\nPlanktonic Larval Duration (PLD). This period starts at hatching and concludes days to \n\nweeks later when the larva settles and starts to adopt a benthic existence in a reef \n\n(Victor, 1983). The importance that the PLD phase has in the mechanisms of larval \n\ndispersal has been highly overestimated in the past decades (Cowen &amp; Sponaugle, \n\n2009). Traditionally, larvae have been considered as passive elements, flowing in the \n\nocean currents with the plankton (Roberts, 1997; Fuiman, 2002; Leis, 2002; Levin, \n\n2006). This being the case, it was assumed that all fish populations were \n\ndemographically \u201copen\u201d populations, connected through larval dispersal (Roberts, \n\n1997; Leis, 2002; Leis, 2006). This way, a simplifying assumption (Leis, 2006) \n\npresupposed that larval behaviour doesn\u00b4t have any significant effect on their \n\ndispersal, and fish larvae are planktonic animals with little control over their \n\ntrajectories, rather than strong-swimming nektonic animals (Leis, 2006). Being so, \n\nlarval dispersal would be primarily dictated by their pelagic larval-stage duration and \n\nocean currents (Roberts, 1983; Leis, 2006; Cowen et al., 2007). With this assumption in \n\nmind, the analysis of larval transport routes was much simpler. Being larval dispersal \n\ncompletely dependent of oceanic factors, all that was needed was an analysis of the \n\nsurface current patterns. The oceanographic models were then highly used in the \n\ndesign of MPA\u2019s, to change the protection status of reefs, and to argue that marine \n\nreserves can maintain both local and outer biodiversity through the supply of \n\npropagules (Leis, 2002).  \n\nHowever, genetic and behavioural studies on reef fishes revealed that demographic \n\nconnectivity and dispersal are not as largely-scaled as often assumed, presenting much \n\nmore modest scales of dispersal (Jones et al., 1999; Swearer et al., 2002; Jones et al., \n\n2005; Pineda et al., 2007). These studies show that there are some population-isolating \n\nmechanisms that enhance local retention (Katz et al., 1983). In the last decade, \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nresearch on the early life-stages of marine fish larvae has revealed behavioural abilities \n\nthat dethrone the simplifying assumption about the passive nature of fish larvae (Leis, \n\n2002; Leis, 2006).  \n\nIt was concluded that larval behaviour plays a much more relevant role in larval \n\ndispersal than initially thought (reviews by Leis, 2006; Pineda et al., 2007). It was found \n\nthat fish larvae develop both swimming and sensory abilities during their pelagic \n\nphase, as well as behavioural mechanisms to avoid stronger currents by occupying the \n\nepibenthic boundary layer (Leis, 2002; Leis, 2006). This way, they are able to actively \n\ninfluence their dispersal by escaping stronger surface currents and swimming at \n\nspeeds greater than the mean speed of currents encountered in their oceanic \n\nenvironments (Leis &amp; Carson-Ewart, 1997), and this behaviour may be triggered by a \n\nnumber of different stimuli, such as reef sounds, changes in light, chemical cues or \n\neven floating objects such as seaweeds (Leis, 2006; Pineda et al., 2007; Kohn &amp; \n\nClements, 2011). Therefore, the traditional assumption that all populations are \u201copen\u201d \n\nis discredited, with populations having higher rates of retention than suspected (Leis, \n\n2002; Levin, 2006).   \n\nWith the purpose of estimating the dispersal rates of larvae, efforts have been made \n\nto develop tagging strategies for use in the aquatic system (Thorrold et al., 2002). \n\nThese methodologies use tags applied to egg batches or newly-hatched larvae, which \n\ncan be of an artificial nature, inserted in the larvae, or natural markings (Thorrold et \n\nal., 2002; 2007; Levin, 2006). Later, these individuals are recaptured when they recruit \n\nto the adult population, and the marked individuals are identified and accounted for. \n\nAfter this, using an extrapolation of the percentage of the population\u2019s total larvae \n\nthat were effectively tagged, an estimate of self-recruitment is made from the \n\npercentage of marked recaptured individuals (Jones, et al., 1999; 2005; Thorrold et al., \n\n2007). \n\nIn order to generate successful results, the tagging method has to fulfill certain \n\nprerequisites (Thorrold et al., 2002): \n\n- Marked individuals must be unambiguously identifiable some time after the \n\napplication of the mark. To do so, the mark has to have an appropriate \n\nretention time, and that all marked individuals are easily recognizable; \n\n- The tagging must not have any effects on the mortality, development and \n\nbehaviour of the marked individuals. Therefore, tags must be invisible to \n\npredators, non-toxic and have no potential effects on the individuals; \n\n- The tagging techniques must allow the marking of multiple individuals at a \n\ntime, preferably in a cost-efficient manner; \n\n- The mark must be quick and inexpensive to detect. \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nBoth artificial and natural tags present advantages and disadvantages, but the only \n\nmethod for marking larvae that remains completely unequivocal is the presence of \n\nartificial tags in recaptured individuals (Thorrold et al., 2002). \n\nNatural tags rely on natural genetic heterogeneity or differences in environmental \n\nconditions to generate population-specific tags. These tags always have a more \n\nequivocal interpretation but, being naturally present, eliminate the need to tag the \n\nindividuals physically. Geochemical signatures of calcifying structures and genetic \n\nmarkers fall in the category of natural tagging. The geochemical markings are \n\ngenerated naturally by variations on environmental conditions, such as salinity, \n\ntemperature and water chemistry. These variations in the environmental conditions \n\nthe larvae faces are naturally \u201cengraved\u201d in its calcifying tissues in the form of differing \n\nisotopic signatures, structural attributes and trace elements (Leis, 2006; Thorrold et al., \n\n2007). This way, as larvae travel through different kinds of waters, each with its \n\nparticular profile of chemical and physical attributes, their travels are \u201crecorded\u201d in the \n\ncalcifying structures (Thorrold et al., 2007). Therefore, one can deduce where the \n\nlarvae originated from, or where it has passed, from the multi-elemental signatures \n\ninduced by a certain quality of water. However, in order to correctly deduce the \n\nlarvae\u2019s origin or route, one must have knowledge and sampling of many elemental \n\nsignatures, and their respective sources, and establish that these signatures are stable \n\nover time (Thorrold et al., 2002; 2007; Levin, 2006). \n\nMethodologies for assessing larval dispersal based on genetic markers have many \n\ndifferent approaches. They can use the genetic variability present in natural \n\npopulations, paternal genetic analysis, natural spawning variation, or even use \n\nindividuals that have been genetically modified in laboratory (Thorrold et al., 2002; \n\nJones et al., 2009). However, these tagging methodologies present many \n\ndisadvantages when compared with other marking methods. Besides being more \n\ncostly to analyze and to apply, the information resulting from these methodologies is \n\nnot easy to interpret and often is unpredictable (Thorrold et al., 2002). \n\nThe marking of the calcifying structures of larvae (otoliths, statoliths, shells) using \n\nchemical artificial markers is a methodology which has been frequently used in larval \n\ndispersal studies (Beltran et al., 1995; Jones et al., 1999; 2005; Almany et al., 2007). \n\nThese marks can be produced by immersion in a solution containing the chemical \n\nmarker, or through supply of food marked with the chemical compound (Thorrold et \n\nal., 2007). The markers more frequently used in this methodology are fluorescent \n\ncompounds, such as tetracycline or oxytetracycline, calcein (Levin, 2006; Thorrold et \n\nal., 2007), radioactive isotopes, such as \n137\n\nBa (Almany et al., 2007; Roy, 2008), \n\nelemental markers (rare earth elements), or physical marks made through extreme \n\nenvironmental changes, such as thermal signals (Thorrold et al., 2002). \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nRare elemental markers use natural elements that are usually found or present in very \n\nlow concentrations in the natural environment and in the larval\u2019s tissues (Thorrold et \n\nal., 2002). This method allows for an easy identification of the marked individuals, as \n\nwell as a good application of the marking to a large number of individuals. However, \n\nmost of the times the elemental tag does not get absorbed or does not have a \n\nretention time long enough for it to serve as a marker, making this tagging technique \n\nhighly unreliable. Besides these disadvantages, the costs associated with preparation \n\nand analysis of the samples is very high when compared to other methodologies with a \n\nhigher level of successful markings (Thorrold et al., 2002). \n\nThermal markings are usually applied to analyze hatchery grown fish, but it is being \n\napproached as a valid methodology to study marine organisms. This methodology \n\nexposes incubating larvae to extreme temperature fluctuations that result in \n\ndistinctive structural banding in the otoliths (Volk et al., 1999). This methodology \n\npresents practically no costs at all for the preparation, and analysis has a cost similar to \n\nother methods using artificial marking and recapture of juveniles (Volk et al., 1999). \n\nSimilarly to the other artificial marking methods, the radioactive isotope labeling \n\nmethodology consists in an artificial marking of the larvae and posterior recapture, \n\nidentification and accounting of tagged juveniles. In this methodology, gravid females \n\nare injected with trace amounts of rare, stable isotopes that are transferred to the \n\noffspring through the egg yolk (Thorrold et al., 2006; Almany et al., 2007; Roy, 2008). \n\nThe retention time of most of these stable isotopes in the female\u2019s body is long \n\nenough that, with a single injection, multiple batches of eggs are marked, producing a \n\nlong-lasting mark in the center of the larvae\u2019s otoliths. These marks can be identified \n\nthrough isotope ratios of the otoliths and are analyzed through Inductively Coupled \n\nPlasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Almany et al., 2007; Roy, 2008). Both Thorrold et \n\nal. (2006) and Roy (2008) studies did not detect any negative effects of the injection of \n\nlow concentrations of stable isotopes on the reproduction rates of the females, or \n\nnegative effects of the isotope labeling on the survival and development of the larvae. \n\nHowever, the materials needed for this methodology are very expensive and, adding \n\nto the laborious work of recollecting the otoliths from the recaptured juveniles, very \n\nspecialized equipment and technicians are needed for the analysis of the isotopic \n\nratios. \n\nTagging with artificial fluorescent compounds is the most widely used of the artificial \n\n-\n\nhn, 1992; Jones et al., 1999). The chemical compound tetracycline is a chemical \n\nartificial marker used to produce a fluorescent mark in the larvae\u2019s otoliths. \n\nTetracycline, as well as oxytetracycline, is an antibiotic and fluorescent compound that \n\nis integrated into the calcifying tissues of the fish, namely the otoliths. Its mark gets \n\nincorporated into the daily growth ring corresponding to the date of the tagging, being \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nvisible under fluorescent light. In cases in which the tagging is done on fish embryos or \n\nlarvae, the tagging is made through immersion of the individuals in a tetracycline \n\ncontaining solution during a preset period of time (Geffen, 1997). Tagging the larvae \n\nthrough tagged food is a problematic methodology since food intake may be irregular \n\nand livi - hn, 1992).  \n\nNumerous authors have developed studies in which they use and/or analyze \n\ntetracycline tagging of larval calcifying structures by immersion in tetracycline \n\nsolutions (Schmitt, 1984; Ts\n\n- , 1992; Beltran et al. 1995; Jones et al., 1995; \n\n1999; 2005; Reinert et al., 1998; Champigneulle &amp; Cachera, 2003; Kingsford et al., \n\n2010; Kohn &amp; Clements, 2011). However, the methodology used for the immersion \n\ndiffers from study to study. In the vast majority, the tagging results from a long-term \n\nimmersion in a low-concentration solution. The time of immersion vary from 1,5 to 24 \n\nhours, and the concentration of the solutions spans from 350 mg.L\n-1\n\n to 1000 mg.L\n-1\n\n \n\n(see Table 10) (Tsukamoto, 1985; Dabrowski &amp; Tsukamoto, 1986; Reinert et al., 1998). \n\nThere are also some works, that use shorter immersions of just a couple of minutes in \n\na saline solution (to cause osmotic shock) with a high concentration of tetracycline \n\n(Alcobendas et al., 1991; 1992; Beltran et al., 1995; Champigneulle &amp; Cachera, 2003), \n\nbut these methodologies are usually employed in studies that focus in lacustrine \n\nspecies. \n\nThe species on wich this study focuses were chosen as model species as their life \n\ncycles\u2019, ecology and behaviour have been studied and described in detail before \n\n(Gon\u00e7alves et al., 1998; Hofrichter &amp; Patzner, 2000; Faria &amp; Gon\u00e7alves, 2010; Tojeira et \n\nal., 2011). Both are benthic spawners, and present parental care behaviours, with the \n\nmale providing protection and aeration of the eggs though fanning and rubbing \n\nbehaviours. They are easily captured during the low tides and maintained and \n\nreproduced in controlled conditions, and larvae can be reared up to settlement. \n\nDistributional (Borges et al., 2007) and behavioural (Faria &amp; Gon\u00e7alves, 2010) studies \n\nsuggest these species may be retained close to shore.  Taken together, these species \n\nare a promising model species to study larval dispersal and retention. \n\nLepadogaster purpurea (Bonnaterre, 1788) and L. lepadogaster (Bonnaterre, 1788) are \n\ntwo abundant species of clingfish (Gobiesocidae family) with a very similar \n\nmorphology. The similarity is such that until recently they were considered two \n\nsubspecies of the same species (Lepadogaster lepadogaster purpurea and \n\nLepadogaster lepadogaster lepadogaster) (Henriques et al., 2002). They have a \n\ndistribution that ranges from the coast of Scotland to Senegal, the Canary and Madeira \n\nIslands and the Mediterranean (L. purpurea) and from the northern coast of Spain \n\n(Galicia) to northeast Africa, the Canary and Madeira Islands and the Mediterranean (L. \n\nlepadogaster) (Henriques et al., 2002). \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nKnowledge of Gobiesocidae ecology and behaviour is relatively poor, particularly due \n\nto their small size, which enables them to occupy very cryptic microhabitats (Gon\u00e7alves \n\net al., 1998; Hofrichter &amp; Patzner, 2000). Both species are common in rocky shores and \n\nbanks of large pebbles and boulder fields, being found underneath rocks. They adhere \n\nto the rocky substractum by means of a sucking disc, which gives an extra adaptation \n\nto small habitats and also allows them to resist to the high water currents typical of \n\nthe sublitoral (Hofrichter &amp; Patzner, 2000). Some species of Gobiesocidae are \n\nconsidered \u201camphibious fish\u201d, being adapted to living conditions in a strongly exposed \n\nhabitat, such as the upper sublitoral that gets exposed each low-tide period (Hofrichter \n\n&amp; Patzner, 2000). \n\nAlthough morphologically similar, these two species differ in their breeding season - L. \n\npurpurea\u2019s breeding season occurs mainly during the winter months until the \n\nbeginning of spring, while L. lepadogaster\u2019s breeding season is during the spring, till \n\nthe beginning of summer (Henriques et al., 2002).The main goal of this work was to \n\nvalidate the procedure for tetracycline tagging of the otoliths of embryos of these two \n\ngobiesocids. In particular, the minimum tetracycline concentration required to ensure \n\nthe marking of the embryo\u2019s otoliths was determined and the possible effect the \n\ndifferent tetracycline concentrations have on the larvae\u2019s survival was tested.\n\n\n\n8 \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\n \n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n1) Collection and handling of breeding adults and eggs  \n\nLepadogaster purpurea egg \n\nbatches and adults were \n\ncollected, during the low tide, \n\nbetween January and March \n\n2012, and Lepadogaster \n\nlepadogaster eggs and adults \n\nwere captured between March \n\nand June 2012 at Alpertuche \n\nbeach (38\u00b028\u2019 N; 8\u00b059\u2019 W) \n\nlocated at the Luiz Saldanha \n\nArr\u00e1bida Marine Park (Fig.1). The \n\negg batches and adults were \n\nrelocated and maintained in the \n\nfacilities located in ISPA-IU \n\n(Instituto Superior de Psicologia \n\nAplicada- Instituto Universit\u00e1rio), \n\nLisbon. After the laboratory work \n\nwas concluded, all the surviving \n\nadults and juveniles were \n\nreleased in the same area. \n\nEgg batches, larvae and adults were kept at an average temperature between 14-16\u00b0C \n\nduring the Winter months, and 15-17\u00b0C during the Spring and Summer months, with a \n\nphotoperiod of 14L:10D. Adults were kept in larger aquariums, with a substratum \n\ncomposed of rocks gathered in Alpertuche beach, some opaque PVC tubes and roof \n\ntiles. This substratum mainly served as shelter and breeding sites for the adults. They \n\nwere daily fed a mix of shrimps, clams and mussels. As hatching approached, rocks \n\nwith eggs were removed from the parental aquaria and transferred to 30 l larval \n\nrearing tank.  \n\n2) Experimental design and tetracycline marking \n\nEggs were immersed in the tetracycline solutions, for 30 minutes, as soon as they \n\nreached the pigmented-eye stage, when the otoliths begin formation (Beltran, et al., \n\n1995; Tojeira, et al., 2011). This time period was chosen as this is usually the time \n\navailable between tides, and this methodology is meant to be used directly in the field \n\nduring the low-tide period. \n\nFig. 1: Sampling site location, on the Portuguese West Coast \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nFor L. purpurea egg batches, solutions with the following tetracycline concentrations \n\nwere used: 400 mg.L\n-1\n\n; 600 mg.L\n-1\n\n; 800 mg.L\n-1\n\n; 1000 mg.L\n-1\n\n and 1400 mg.L\n-1 \n\n(Table 1). In \n\naddition, and for validation purposes, newly-hatched larvae were immersed for longer \n\nperiods of time (1, 2 and 15 hours) in 1000 mg.L\n-1 \n\nsolutions. These batches worked as a \n\npositive control, and were used to ascertain the appearance of the fluorescent \n\ntetracycline mark. For L. lepadogaster egg batches, the following three tetracycline \n\nconcentrations were used: 600 mg.L\n-1\n\n, 800 mg.L\n-1\n\n and 1000 mg.L\n-1\n\n (Table 1).  \n\nSix egg batches from L. purpurea and 5 egg batches from L. lepadogaster were \n\nassigned to a control group, being immersed in \u201cclean\u201d water for the same 30 minute \n\nperiod.  \n\nTable 1: Number of replicates (egg batches) for each treatment for Lepadogaster purpurea and L. lepadogaster. \n\n \n\n \n\n3) Larval rearing and sampling \n\nAfter immersion, eggs were placed back to the rearing aquaria, where larvae \n\nhatched.   Aquaria were maintained at 14-15 \u00baC for Lepadogaster purpurea and 16-\n\n17 \u00baC for L. lepadogaster, which was consistent with the mean water temperature \n\nat the sampling area in the testing dates (Henriques et al. 2002). All tanks were \n\nmaintained at a salinity of 34-35 PSU, with a photoperiod of 14L:10D. Larvae\u2019s diary \n\ndiet was composed of Artemia salina and rotifers (supplied by Aqu\u00e1rio Vasco da \n\nGama), and fed ad libitum. L. purpurea could not be reared until settlement, unlike \n\nL. lepadogaster, which was successfully reared until the end of its pelagic phase. \n\nLarvae were sacrificed in different developmental stages, and preserved in 96% \n\nalcohol.  \n\nTo examine the effects of the different tetracycline concentrations on mortality \n\nrates,   the number of live larvae was daily counted in each tank. Mortality rates \n\nwere determined for two different development periods: \n\na) 5 days after hatching; \n\nb) 10 days after hatching. \n\n \n\nTreatment \nN\u00ba de Replicates \n\nL. purpurea L. lepadogaster \n\nControl 6 5 \n400 mg.L\n\n-1\n 3 - \n\n600 mg.L\n-1\n\n 3 5 \n800 mg.L\n\n-1\n 3 3 \n\n1000 mg.L\n-1\n\n 3 3 \n\n1400 mg.L\n-1\n\n 5 - \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\nThese time limits were chosen as they represent critical steps in larval \n\ndevelopment: mortality is higher in the first 5 days (A. Faria personal observation), \n\nafter which it starts to decrease; and larvae of L. lepadogaster start spending more \n\ntime close to the bottom around 10 days after hatching (A. Faria personal \n\nobservation).  \n\n \n\n4)  Otolith extraction, preparation and analysis \n\nOtoliths were removed and mounted in preheated microscope slides using \n\nCRYSTAL BOND\u2122. Samples were kept in opaque boxes, in order to avert \n\ntetracycline degradation due to sunlight exposure. Otoliths were observed under a \n\nfluorescence microscope Olympus BX-50. Two different fluorescence filters were \n\nused, so that the presence or absence of fluorescence from tetracycline could be \n\nmore accurately determined. Tetracycline has an excitation peak at 390 nm and an \n\nemission peak at 560 nm (Skinner &amp; Nalbandian, 1975; Pautke, et al., 2010). The \n\nfilters used had and excitement specter from 450 to 480 nm and an emission \n\nspecter starting at 515 nm (Olympus U-MWB (WB)), and an excitement specter \n\nfrom 330 to 385 nm and an emission specter between 420 and 700 nm (Olympus \n\nU-MWU (WU)). After observation of the positive control otoliths (from larvae \n\nimmersed in 1000 mg. L\n-1\n\n tetracycline solution for 1, 2 and 15 hours), a \n\ncharacterization of the different ranks that would later on be used to categorize \n\nthe other otoliths was made. This characterization would analyze the thickness and \n\nshape of the fluorescent marking and the contrast between the otolith and the \n\nsurrounding medium. The measuring of the fluorescent marking was made using \n\nAxioVision V. 4.8.2.0. software. \n\nSamples were classified in three categories, according to the visibility of the \n\ntetracycline marks: Clear marking (1); Not clear/ With Autofluorescence (1/0); No \n\nFluorescence (0). The treatment with the biggest proportion of samples classified \n\nas 1, would be considered the most successful one. This analysis methodology is \n\nsimilar to the one used by Tsukamoto (1985) and by Dabrowski &amp; Tsukamoto \n\n(1986). \n\n5) Data analysis \n\nThe mortality rates were calculated from the percentage of total dead larvae from \n\neach day, for each replicate. When all the percentages were collected from each \n\nreplicate, and these values used for statistical analysis. \n\nIn order to verify the existence of statistically significant relations between \n\ntreatments applied to larvae and the tetracycline markings and the mortality rates, \n\na variance analysis of the results was made. The assumptions for the ANOVA were \n\nverified for every set of data, having used the Shapiro-Wilk\u2019s test to verify \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\nnormalcy, and the Lavene test for homocedasticity. When these prerequisites were \n\nnot fulfilled, the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was applied. When the \n\nrequisites were fulfilled, a one-way ANOVA was used.  \n\nAll statistical analysis were made using StatSoft Inc. (2011) STATISTICA  software \n\n(version 10). \n\n  \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\n Results \n\n1. Tetracycline marking  \n\nTesting began with immersion of L. purpurea larvae in low-concentration solutions \n\n(400, 600 and 800 mg.L\n-1\n\n). After viewing these samples in the fluorescence microscope \n\nand assessing that no markings or fluorescence were visible, immersions were made \n\nusing higher-concentrated solutions (1000 and 1400 mg.L\n-1\n\n). The samples resulting \n\nfrom these immersions exhibited fluorescence, but no defined and clear tetracycline \n\nmarking. \n\nWith these results in mind, when immersions of L. lepadogaster larvae began, high-\n\nconcentrated tetracycline solutions were used from the start (800 and 1000 mg.L\n-1\n\n). A \n\nlower- concentrated solution was also used (600 mg.L\n-1\n\n) after viewing fluorescence in \n\nsamples resulting from the 800 mg.L\n-1\n\n immersions.    \n\n1.1. Positive control otoliths \n\nFor the validation of the marking technique, newly-hatched L. purpurea larvae were \n\nimmersed in a 1000 mg.L\n-1\n\n tetracycline solution for 1, 2 and 15 hours.  \n\nWhen observing otoliths from these treatments, a vast difference in fluorescence and \n\nmarking quality was observed between the samples that came from the 1 and 2 hours \n\nimmersion and the samples that came from the 15 hours one. The samples from the \n\n15 hour immersion-period (N=2) displayed a much better and distinct tetracycline \n\nmarking (Fig. 2).  These samples were then used for validation purposes, by comparing \n\nthe obtained fluorescence mark to the mark produced by the treatments being \n\ninvestigated.  \n\nIn these samples, the tetracycline marking in the otoliths presented a minimum \n\nthickness of 2.0 \u00b5m. This kind of sample is an example of an otolith with a clear \n\ntetracycline fluorescent mark, and would be classified as 1 (\u201cClear Marking\u201d) in the \n\nMarking Efficiency Analysis (see Methods). In this sense, in order to an otolith to be \n\nranked as 1 (\u201cClear Marking\u201d), its fluorescent mark must have a thickness of at least \n\n2.0 \u00b5m. In order to determine if with a lower-concentration solution the tetracycline \n\nmarking would be thinner, the markings present on the otoliths from the 2-hour \n\nimmersion treatment (N=2) were also measured. Similarly to the other validation \n\notoliths, the tetracycline markings found in the 2-hour immersion otoliths had a \n\nthickness bigger than 2 \u00b5m, not differing much from the measurements taken from the \n\n15-hour immersion otoliths.  \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 2: Photographs of an otolith removed from a 4 days-old L. purpurea larva that had been immersed in a 1000 \n\nmg.L\n-1\n\n solution for 15 hours. The larva was immersed right after hatching, and sacrificed 4 days after hatching. The \n\narrows indicate the tetracycline mark. The same otoliths were seen under fluorescent light using two different \n\nfilters. A: WB (excitement specter from 450 to 480 nm and an emission specter starting at 515 nm); B: WU \n\n(excitement specter from 330 to 385 nm and an emission specter between 420 and 700 nm). \n\nFrom these results, the characterization of the different ranks was as follows: \n\n Rank 1: \u201cClear Marking\u201d: \n\no When observed under fluorescent light, the otolith shows a clear and \n\ndiscernible tetracycline marking in the form of a bright ring; \n\no The marking must completely surround the otolith (whole ring); \n\no It has to have a good contrast with the surrounding medium; \n\no The tetracycline marking has to have at least 2.0 \u00b5m thickness. \n\n Rank 1/0: \u201cNo Clear Marking\u201d or \u201cWith Autofluorescence\u201d: \n\no When observed under fluorescent light the otolith shows fluorescence, \n\neven in the control treatment; \n\no Does not show a visible and discernible tetracycline mark (&lt;2.0 \u00b5m). \n\n Rank 0: \u201cNo Fluorescence\u201d: \n\no When observed under fluorescent light, the otolith is not visible. \n\n \n\n1.2. Treatment otoliths \n\nA comparison of all otoliths was made through visual inspection of otoliths. In addition, \n\na measurement of the thickness of tetracycline mark was made. For this visual \n\nanalysis, the photographs used were the ones taken under fluorescent light using the \n\nOlympus U-MWU (WU) filter, as the tetracycline marks are more visible with this filter \n\ncompared to the photographs taken using the Olympus U-MWB (WB) filter (Fig. 2). \n\nThe positive control treatment enabled the visual comparison of L. purpurea otoliths \n\nexposed to the same tetracycline concentration (1000 mg.L\n-1\n\n), but increasing \n\nimmersion times (30 minutes, 1, 2 and 15 hours). Otoliths from the 30 minute \n\nA B \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\nimmersion period (N=11) did not all display fluorescence; the ones that had \n\nfluorescence were blurry and did not present a distinct tetracycline mark. Nonetheless, \n\nthere were some tetracycline marks, but none of them had a thickness larger than 2.0 \n\n\u00b5m (biggest had 1.31 \u00b5m). \n\nThe otoliths from the 1 hour immersion period (N=7) all presented strong \n\nfluorescence. However, none of them had a clear, distinct tetracycline mark.  \n\nThe otoliths from the 2 hours immersion period presented a strong fluorescence and a \n\ngood contrast with the background of the sample. The tetracycline mark is visible, but \n\nthe autofluorescence is still present. In all samples the tetracycline fluorescent \n\nmarking\u2019s thickness is bigger than 2 \u00b5m (2.07 and 2.74 \u00b5m). \n\n \n\nFig. 3: Photographs of otoliths from L. purpurea larvae, using a fluorescence microscope with the WU filter. All \n\nlarvae were immersed in a tetracycline solution of 1000 mg.L\n-1\n\n for different periods of time: A- immersion of 30 \n\nminutes (7 days-old larva); B- immersion of 1 hour (7 days-old larva); C- immersion of 2 hours (4 days-old larva); D- \n\nimmersion of 15 hours (4 days-old larva). \n\nRegarding the otoliths from the different concentration treatments (30 minutes \n\nimmersion period), there was not a clear distinction between otoliths from control \n\ngroups and otoliths from treatment groups. In addition, some control otoliths \n\nappeared to have a tetracycline mark (Fig. 4), but none of the so-called tetracycline \n\nmarkings had the necessary thickness in order to be considered a true fluorescent \n\nmarking (0.76 \u00b5m for otolith C and 0.46 \u00b5m for otolith D). \n\n  \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 4: Photographs of otoliths from L. purpurea larvae, using a fluorescence microscope with the WU filter. All \n\notoliths come from control group larvae, i.e. larvae that did not suffer immersion in a tetracycline solution. Otoliths \n\nA and B are examples of how the vast majority of control samples look like. Otoliths C and D appear to have a \n\ntetracycline marking around the edge of the otolith. Otoliths were extracted from larvae with the following ages: A- \n\n5 days; B- 7 days; C- 5 days; D- 1 days. \n\nDespite this, an increase in autofluorescence with increasing concentration of \n\ntetracycline solution in which the larvae were immersed was observed (Fig. 5). Only \n\nthe samples that came from treatment group with a T400 mg.L\n-1\n\n did not display any \n\nsigns of fluorescence. However, no sample showed signs of a distinct tetracycline \n\nmarking and many preparations did not show a satisfactory contrast with the \n\nbackground.  \n\n \n\nFig. 5: Photographs of otoliths from L. purpurea larvae, using a fluorescence microscope with the WU filter. All \n\nlarvae were immersed in tetracycline solutions of different concentrations, for a time period of 30 minutes. The \n\ndifferent concentrations were: A- 600 mg.L\n-1\n\n; B- 800 mg.L\n-1\n\n; C- 1000 mg.L\n-1\n\n; D-1400 mg.L\n-1\n\n. Otoliths were extracted \n\nfrom larvae with the following ages: A- 0 days; B- 0 days; C- 7 days; D- 11 days. \n\nSimilarly to what was verified for L. purpurea, there was a lot of autofluorescence in all \n\nsamples of L. lepadogaster, regardless of the provenience of the otolith (treatment or \n\ncontrol) (Figs 6 and 7). There were cases in which some marks were observed, but \n\nnone had the minimum thickness (2 \u00b5m) to be ranked as a \u201ctrue\u201d tetracycline mark.  \n\nHowever, as the solution\u2019s concentration increased, so did the intensity of the otoliths \n\nfluorescence. This increase in brightness translated in an increase of contrast between \n\nthe sample\u2019s otoliths (see Fig. 7). \n\n \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 6: Photographs of otoliths from L. lepadogaster larvae, using a fluorescence microscope with the WU filter.

Otoliths \n\nA and B are examples of how the vast majority of control samples look like. Otoliths C and D appear to have a \n\ntetracycline marking around the edge of the otolith. Otoliths were extracted from larvae with the following ages: A- \n\n0 days; B- 0 days; C- 20 days; D- 12 days. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 7: Photographs of otoliths from L. lepadogaster larvae, taken using a fluorescence microscope with the WU \n\nfilter. Otolith A came from a control group larva, and otoliths B through D came from larvae that were immersed in \n\ntetracycline solutions of different concentrations, for a time period of 30 minutes. The different concentrations \n\nwere: B- 600 mg.L\n-1\n\n; C- 800 mg.L\n-1\n\n; D- 1000 mg.L\n-1\n\n. Otoliths were extracted from larvae with the following ages: A- 0 \n\ndays; B- 0 days; C- 7 days; D- 8 days. \n\nFigure 8 shows, in more detail, the comparison of a control otolith (A) and a treatment \n\notolith, immersed for 30 minutes in a tetracycline solution of 600 mg.L\n-1\n\n (B). As it can \n\nbe seen, there is very little difference between the two otoliths. \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 8: Photographs of otoliths from L. lepadogaster larvae, taken using a fluorescence microscope. The photo to the \n\nleft was taken using white light, and the one to the right was taken under fluorescence light with the WU filter. \n\nOtoliths marked with A came from a larvae belonging to a control group, and the otolith marked with B came from a \n\nlarvae that had been immersed in a 600 mg.L\n-1\n\n tetracycline solution. \n\n1.3. Classification of samples \n\nThere were no L. purpurea otoliths showing a clear and obvious tetracycline mark \n\n(Table 2). There is a very high percentage of otoliths classified as 1/0 (\u201cNo Clear \n\nMarking\u201d or \u201cWith Autofluorescence\u201d), being the control, T1000 mg.L\n-1\n\n and T1400 \n\nmg.L\n-1\n\n groups the one with the higher percentages (75, 100 and 86,36%, respectively). \n\nThe only group that showed no fluorescence whatsoever was the T400 mg.L\n-1\n\n \n\ntreatment group, with 0 otoliths ranked as 1/0 or 1.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\nTable 2: Result, in percentages, of classification of L. purpurea otoliths, where 0 is classified as \u201cNo fluorescence\u201d; \n\n1/0 as \u201cNo clear marking\u201d or \u201cWith Autofluorescence\u201d; and 1 as \u201cClear marking\u201d. \n\nTREATMENT \nPERCENTAGES N \n\n(otoliths) 0 1/0 1 \n\nControl 25.0% 75.0% 0.0% 16 \n\n400 mg.L\n-1\n\n 100.0% 0.0% 0.0% 3 \n\n600 mg.L\n-1\n\n 60.0% 40.0% 0.0% 6 \n\n800 mg.L\n-1\n\n 50.0% 50.0% 0.0% 4 \n\n1000 mg.L\n-1\n\n 0.0% 100.0% 0.0% 11 \n\n1400 mg.L\n-1\n\n 13.6% 86.4% 0.0% 23 \n\n \n\nFrom the otoliths classified as 1/0 (\u201cNo clear Marking\u201d or \u201cWith Autofluorescence\u201d), \n\nthe otoliths with a possible tetracycline marking and their respective thickness are \n\npresented in Table 3. \n\nTable 3: Thickness measures in \u00b5m of possible tetracycline markings in otoliths of L. purpurea larvae from the \n\ndifferent treatment groups and from the control groups. \n\nL. purpurea \n\nTreatment \n\nN\u00ba of \npossibly \ntagged \notoliths \n\nAverage \nthickness \n\n(\u00b5m) \n\nTotal \notoliths \n\n% \n\nControl 2 0.61 16 12.5% \n\n400 mg.L\n-1\n\n 0 - 3 0.0% \n\n600 mg.L\n-1\n\n 0 - 6 0.0% \n\n800 mg.L\n-1\n\n 0 - 4 0.0% \n\n1000 mg.L\n-1\n\n 2 1.11 11 18.2% \n\n1400 mg.L\n-1\n\n 1 0.92 23 4.4% \n\n \n\nIn order to ascertain if a statistically significant relation between the different \n\nthickness measures and the treatments a statistical analysis of variance was made. \n\nSeeing as these data do not have the necessary homocedasticity to apply a one-way \n\nANOVA, a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was applied. This test produced a p value \n\nof 0.2326. Being large that 0.05, this means the H0 is accepted, and that no significant \n\ndifferences between the variances were detected.  \n\nSimilarly to the pattern observed for L. purpurea, there were no L. lepadogaster \n\notoliths classified as having a clear and distinct fluorescent tetracycline marking (Table \n\n4). The percentages of otoliths ranked as 0 and 1/0 in the control group are very \n\nsimilar to the ones observed in L. purpurea. The same applies to the other treatment, \n\nexcept for the T600 mg.L\n-1\n\n group.

The \n\nthicknesses of these markings and their respective groups are presented in Table 5.  \n\nTable 5: Thickness measures in \u00b5m of possible tetracycline markings in otoliths of L. lepadogaster larvae from the \n\ndifferent treatment groups and from the control groups. \n\nL. lepadogaster \n\nTreatment \n\nN\u00ba of \npossibly \ntagged \notoliths \n\nAverage \nthickness \n\n(\u00b5m) \n\nTotal \notoliths \n\n% \n\nControl 7 1.06 43 16.3% \n\n600 mg.L\n-1\n\n 2 1.03 61 3.3% \n\n800 mg.L\n-1\n\n 4 1.44 45 8.9% \n\n1000 mg.L\n-1\n\n 0 - 26 0.0% \n\n \n\nAs these data fulfilled the necessary normality and homocedasticity assumptions, a \n\none-way ANOVA variance analysis was performed.

Mortality rates \n\nThe effects of tetracycline concentration on the larvae\u2019s survival rates in the first 5 \n\ndays after hatching are shown in Fig. 9,  \n\n \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 9: Mortality rates up to 5 days post-hatching for Lepadogaster lepadogaster and Lepadogaster purpurea for each treatment. \n\n \n\nThere were no statistically significant effects of tetracycline tagging on the survival \n\nrates of L. purpurea (F=0.86; p>0.05) and L. lepadogaster (F=1.34; p>0.05) larvae up to \n\n5 days post-hatching.  \n\nIt was not possible to determine mortality rates up to 10 days post-hatching for L. \n\npurpurea since out of the 25 different treatment groups, only 5 of them had larvae \n\nthat survived till that age. On the other hand, L. lepadogaster had 10 out of 16 \n\ndifferent groups with larvae that survived, at least, until 10 days post-hatching. \n\nTherefore, it was only possible to determine and analyze mortality rates up until 10 \n\ndays post-hatching for L. lepadogaster. \n\n \n\n0% \n\n10% \n\n20% \n\n30% \n\n40% \n\n50% \n\nL0 L1 L2 L3 L4 L5 \n\nM\no\n\nrt\na\n\nli\nty\n\n (\n%\n\n) \n\nControl \n\nLep purp \n\nLep lep \n\n0% \n\n10% \n\n20% \n\n30% \n\n40% \n\n50% \n\nL0 L1 L2 L3 L4 L5 \n\nM\no\n\nrt\na\n\nli\nty\n\n (\n%\n\n) \n\n600 mg.L-1 \n\nLep purp \n\nLep lep \n\n0% \n\n10% \n\n20% \n\n30% \n\n40% \n\n50% \n\nL0 L1 L2 L3 L4 L5 \n\nM\no\n\nrt\na\n\nli\nty\n\n (\n%\n\n) \n\nT800 mg.L-1 \n\nLep purp \n\nLep lep \n\n0% \n\n10% \n\n20% \n\n30% \n\n40% \n\n50% \n\nL0 L1 L2 L3 L4 L5 \n\nM\no\n\nrt\na\n\nli\nty\n\n (\n%\n\n) \n\nT1000 mg.L-1 \n\nLep purp \n\nLep lep \n\n0% \n\n10% \n\n20% \n\n30% \n\n40% \n\n50% \n\nL0 L1 L2 L3 L4 L5 \n\nM\no\n\nrt\na\n\nli\nty\n\n (\n%\n\n) \n\nT400 mg.L-1 \n\nLep purp \n\n0% \n\n10% \n\n20% \n\n30% \n\n40% \n\n50% \n\nL0 L1 L2 L3 L4 L5 \n\nM\no\n\nrt\na\n\nli\nty\n\n (\n%\n\n) \n\nT1400 mg.L-1 \n\nLep purp \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\nResults show that there were no statistically significant effects of the tetracycline \n\ntagging on mortality rates of L. lepadogaster larvae up to 10 days post-hatching \n\n(F=0.25; p>0,05).\n\n\n\n23 \n \n\nDiscussion \n\nIn the vast majority of studies using tetracycline tagging, the mark has been described \n\nas a fluorescent ring present in the daily increment correspondent to the day the \n\ntagging occurred (Schmitt, 1984; Tsukamoto, 1984; Dabrowski &amp; Tsukamoto, 1986). \n\nHowever, the markings observed from this work\u2019s samples did not match the \n\ndescriptions. Most observed otoliths presented a homogeneous fluorescence spread \n\nthroughout the whole otolith, without any conspicuous fluorescent rings. Many \n\notoliths presented the core as being a little brighter than the rest of the structure; in \n\nsome of them, the fluorescence was blurry; and in others the otolith structure \n\nappeared vividly. There have been many studies of validation or daily increment \n\ndeposit rates on the otolith that use a tetracycline fluorescent marking in the otolith as \n\nreference. In this case, all resulting fluorescence marks were so blurry and indistinct, \n\nthe number of daily increments occupied by the tetracycline marking was not possible \n\nto validate. \n\nIn tetracycline tagging studies, observations of autofluorescence of otoliths are \n\nfrequent (Schmitt, 1984; Tsukamoto, 1985). These studies described the \n\nautofluorescence as a faint fluorescence around the edges and occasionally along \n\ncracks and the surface of the otolith. In this work, autofluorescence was observed, but \n\nin a much more obvious mode. Most otoliths (12 for L. purpurea and 26 for L. \n\nlepadogaster) that were extracted from control group larvae (without treatment) \n\nshowed, unexpectedly, clear fluorescence. In most of these cases, the fluorescence \n\nobserved in control otoliths was stronger and more noticeable than fluorescence in \n\ntreatment otoliths (Figs. 4 and 6). This autofluorescence in control group otoliths \n\ncould, in fact, be mistaken for a true tetracycline marking. Therefore, it was concluded \n\nthat autofluorescence was present in most otoliths, independently of the treatment.   \n\nNeither of the 30-minutes immersion treatments yielded positive results, i.e. no \n\notoliths displayed a clear and distinct tetracycline fluorescent marking. However, there \n\nis a very high percentage of otoliths classified as 1/0 (\u201cNo Clear Marking\u201d \n\nor\u201dAutofluorescence\u201d), which could either mean autofluorescence or a weak and \n\nindistinct tetracycline marking. Statistical analysis of the otoliths that had a possible, \n\nbut not clear tetracycline marking confirms that there were no significant relations \n\nbetween the thicknesses found in these indistinct marks and the treatment groups \n\nthey belonged to (see Table 6). This facts, adding to the high number of false positives \n\nfound in the control groups (see Tables 3 and 4) indicates that 30-minutes immersions, \n\nindependently of the concentration of the tetracycline solutions, do not produce \n\nreliable markings.  \n\nWhen comparing control group otoliths and treatment group otoliths, most of the \n\ntimes they are indistinguishable from one another due to strong presence of \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\nautofluorescence in the untreated otoliths. This would result in an inability to indentify \n\nthe marked recruits from the unmarked ones, at the time of recapture and \n\nquantification, leading to extremely erroneous estimations of the self recruitment of \n\nthe target population.   \n\nWhen comparing the visual aspect of otoliths from larvae that were immersed in a \n\n1000 mg.L\n-1\n\n tetracycline solution for different periods of time (1, 2 and 15 hours), an \n\nincrease in the quality of the fluorescent marking and in the contrast between the \n\notolith and the surrounding medium could be verified. Through this visual analysis, it \n\nwas possible to see that, up to 2 hours of immersion in a 1000 mg.L\n-1\n\n tetracycline \n\nsolution, otolith tagging is extremely difficult. However, as the immersion time \n\nincreased from 2 to 15 hours, the quality and intensity of the fluorescence of the \n\ntetracycline marking increased, reaching a fluorescent intensity that even masked the \n\nautofluorescence, translating in a better contrast between the otolith and the \n\nbackground (see Fig. 3). This comparison of effectiveness between longer and shorter \n\nperiods of immersion was not accomplished for L. lepadogaster, and therefore a \n\npositive control treatment for this species is lacking. Taken together, these results \n\nsuggest that the key-factor in a successful tagging of fish larvae\u2019s otoliths is not only \n\nthe concentration of the tetracycline solution, but mainly the immersion time. In most \n\nof the studies that make use of tetracycline tagging of larvae\u2019s otoliths, the immersion \n\ntime is never inferior to a 1,5 -hour period (see table 10). \n\nTable 6: List of various authors and immersion times and tetracycline solution concentrations used in their \n\nrespective studies. All studies targeted marine fish species. \n\nAuthor(s) \nImmersion \n\ntime(s) \nConcentration(s) \n\nused \n\nSchmitt, 1984 12 h 250 mg.L\n-1\n\n \n\nTsukamoto, 1985 1,5 - 48 h 0 - 2000 mg.L\n-1\n\n \n\nSiegfried &amp; Weinstein, 1989 24 h 400 mg.L\n-1\n\n \n\nReinert et al., 1998 6 - 8 h 350 - 400 mg.L\n-1\n\n \n\nWelsford, 2003 24 h 200 mg.L\n-1\n\n \n\nJones et al., 2005 2 h 250 mg.L\n-1\n\n \n\nKingsford et al., 2011 24 h 375 mg.L\n-1\n\n \n \n\nAs can be seen in Table 10, most of the authors use a longer immersion period and \n\nsolutions with lower concentrations than the one used in this study. Tsukamoto \n\n(1985), for example, tested a vast array of immersion times and different concentrated \n\nsolutions. The shorter immersion, of 1,5-hour,  did not yield any positive markings, \n\nhaving his results pointed that, for egg marking, the tetracycline tagging starts to be \n\neffective only from a 6-hour immersion in a 300 mg.L\n-1\n\n solution. Jones et al. (2005), on \n\nthe other hand, use a fairly short-time immersion with a low-concentrated solution \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\n(2h, 250 mg.L\n-1\n\n). These apparently contradictory results may be attributed to \n\ndifferences in seawater temperature in which the immersion was made. Dabrowski &amp; \n\nTsukamoto (1985) study the possible effects that temperature may have in the \n\nincorporation of the tetracycline mark. They concluded that lower temperatures result \n\nin a much thinner tetracycline marking, suggesting that this may be related to the \n\ndifferent metabolism and growth rates that larvae have at different temperatures. \n\nBeing so, this difference in immersion times and concentration may come from the \n\nfact that while Tsukamoto (1985) worked with ayu fish (Plecoglossus altivelis) using \n\nwater at 20\u00b0C, Jones et al. (2005) worked with the tropical panda clownfish \n\n(Amphiprion polymnus) in Papua New Guinea where sea surface temperature goes \n\nfrom 24 to 31\u00b0C. Vigliola (1997) also considers the possibility that salinity might affect \n\ntetracycline incorporation as well. He states that one hypothesis for the difference \n\nverified in the successfulness of this marking method between freshwater and marine \n\nfish was the chelating reaction that tetracycline has with the divalent cations of \n\nseawater. However, when the marking immersion was tried using a NaCl solution \n\ninstead of seawater\n\n-\n\n-\n\n(1992). In their work, they successfully tagged coregonid larvae\u2019s otoliths with an \n\nimmersion time of only one hour. However, they came to the conclusion that, in order \n\nto have a clear marking, the minimum concentration needed was 1000 mg.L\n-1\n\n.  \n\nSo it seems that, in order to have successful markings, one needs to have several \n\nvariables in mind, such as the nature of the species (marine vs lacustrine) and water \n\ntemperature. Finally, the necessary concentration of the tetracycline solution will \n\nhighly depend of the immersion times that will be applied.  \n\nOne of the goals of this study was to assess the successfulness and reliability of this \n\nmethodology to tag otoliths of gobiesocidae larvae using an immersion time of only 30 \n\nminutes. This immersion time limit was established in order to proceed with the \n\ntetracycline marking of egg batches directly in the field during the low-tide period. \n\nAccording to the results, an immersion of at least 2 hours is necessary in order to \n\nproduce a clear and distinct tetracycline marking in the larvae\u2019s otoliths. Being so, it \n\ncan be concluded that this tagging methodology is not the best suited for this study\u2019s \n\nneeds. However, seeing as the 2-hour immersion produces good and clear tetracycline \n\nfluorescent markings, an alteration in the methodology is possible. Instead of \n\nproceeding with the immersions only during the low-tide period, a two-hour \n\nimmersion in tetracycline would be made, and the egg batches would be returned to \n\ntheir original location through scuba-diving. It\u2019s not as practical as the orginal \n\nmethodology, but it\u2019s a good alternative. \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\nDespite the unsuccessful tagging, the immersion of larvae in tetracycline solutions did \n\nnot exhibit any significant effects on survival rates of both species in the first 5 days \n\npost-hatching (Fig. 9), as well as close to settlement in Lepadogaster lepadogaster. \n\nThese results are in accordance to other studies, such as Tsukamoto (1985) and \n\nDabrowski &amp; Tsukamoto (1986). These authors concluded that not only the tagging \n\ndoes not affect the larvae\u2019s development and survival rates, but the tetracycline may \n\nin fact aid in the larvae\u2019s survival through its antibiotic properties (Dabrowski &amp; \n\nTsukamoto, 1986; Beltran et al., 1995). Rearing of L. purpurea was not as successful as \n\nL. lepadogaster and estimates of mortality rates close so settlement were not possible. \n\nRearing fish larvae in laboratory conditions is extremely difficult, and time consuming. \n\nFish larvae are very sensitive, they die very easily (Holt &amp; Riley, 1999- unpublished \n\ndata), and it\u2019s not always an easy task to find the best conditions for maintenance in \n\nartificial environments. The longer pelagic larval duration of L. purpurea in contrast to \n\nL. lepadogaster (Tojeira et al. 2012) may explain the unsuccessful rearing of the former \n\nspecies, but also, there were some logistic problems in the laboratory\u2019s aquarium \n\nsystem that caused a very high mortality of L. purpurea larvae, drastically decreasing \n\nthe available N for this species. In addition, these species produce a low number of \n\neggs, and therefore the number of larvae at hatching was never high.  \n\nAlthough this methodology revealed itself to be unsuitable to the needs of this study, \n\nother tagging techniques may prove more adequate. One of these methodologies is \n\ntagging via radioactive stable isotopes, such as \n137\n\nBa (Thorrold, 2006; Almany et al., \n\n2007; Roy, 2008). The mark is deposited in the larvae\u2019s otoliths and, when applied in \n\nthe correct dosages, this procedure has little to no effect on development and survival \n\nof the tagged subjects, nor on the reproduction of the injected females (Thorrold et al., \n\n2006; Roy, 2008). However, it does present numerous advantages and disadvantages \n\nwhen compared with the tetracycline tagging method. The main disadvantage is the \n\ncost. The materials used in tagging are much more expensive and the equipment \n\nnecessary to proceed with the observations require a much more specialized and \n\ntechnical approach. However, with this tagging technique a single application of the \n\nradioactive tag has the potential to mark simultaneously numerous egg batches. Due \n\nto its high retention time in the gravid female\u2019s organism, a single injection has the \n\npotential to mark every single egg that female will produce in that reproductive period, \n\nmaking this method much easier to apply to a larger number of larvae. Not only this, \n\nbut receiving this mark via maternal transmission means that the individual will remain \n\ntagged for the rest of its life (Thorrold, 2006), eliminating the retention time dilemma., \n\nThe tagging through radioactive stable isotopes technique is a very good and reliable \n\nmarking method for large number of larvae and, seeing as the only procedure \n\nnecessary for the marking is an injection, seems adequate for in situ application on the \n\ngravid females. However, notwithstanding the unsuccessfulness of this tetracycline \n\ntagging methodology, in order to execute a survey of larval dispersal of a marine fish \n\nspecies, several estimates are necessary, and most of the times they are extremely \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\ndifficult to obtain. First, an extrapolation of the percentage of total spawned larvae \n\nfrom the target population that were actually marked is necessary. This would involve \n\na survey of the number of egg batches produced by the target population, and of the \n\nmean number of eggs in each batch, plus a later estimate of natural mortality rates \n\nsuffered by the young larvae. Secondly, it would be necessary to recapture as many \n\nrecruits as possible, and estimate the percentage of the total population of recruits \n\nthat were captured. And then, using these population extrapolations and counting how \n\nmany of the recaptured recruits bear the chemical marking, an estimate of self \n\nrecruitment of the target population can be ascertained. As can be deduced, these \n\nextrapolations and estimates are extremely difficult to make, and can be even \n\nimpossible if the target population has a widespread residential area, or a high rate of \n\nlarval dispersal. For example, Jones (2005) made a successful estimate of self \n\nrecruitment of a population, but the target species was a fish species whose habitat \n\ncomes down to a single anemone. Due to this extremely limited habitat, it became \n\neasier to proceed with tagging and recapturing that enveloped practically the entire \n\npopulation.  In the case of L. purpurea and L. lepadogaster, their habitat in Luiz \n\nSaldanha Arr\u00e1bida Marine Park is relatively limited, seeing as both species\u2019 \n\ndistributions in that area are practically limited to Alpertuche beach. With this limited \n\nhabitat and the fact that these species\u2019 larvae have a morphology and ontogeny that \n\nsuggest a mainly benthic development, indicating a high probability of retention in \n\ntheir spawning location, make these species an ideal subject for this type of survey. \n\nIn conclusion, the methodology for tagging larvae otoliths with the chemical \n\ncompound tetracycline using an immersion time of only 30 minutes revealed itself \n\nunsuccessful and unreliable. In order to effectively tag the larvae, a longer period of \n\nexposure to the artificial tag was necessary. However, seeing as these species present \n\nideal characteristics for a larval dispersal study, an opportunity to further develop \n\nknowledge on temperate reef fish ecology should not go to waste. Although longer \n\nimmersion periods are not possible in field tagging, the testing and study of another \n\ntagging technique, such as stable isotope labeling, is needed. \n\n\n\n28 \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n29 \n \n\n \n\nReferences \n\nAlcobendas, M., LeComte, F., Castanet, J., Meunier, F., J. and Maire, P.
