The primary attention was centered on A(Mn,Nb)O3-? (A = Sr, Ca) \nand (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-based systems, lanthanum chromite substituted with \nacceptor-type and variable-valence cations, and various Ni-containing cermets. \nEmphasis was given to phase stability of the materials, their crystal structure, \nmicrostructure of porous electrode layers and dense ceramics, electronic \nconductivity, Seebeck coefficient, oxygen permeability, thermal and chemical \ninduced expansion, and anodic overpotentials of the electrodes deposited onto  \n(La,Sr)(Ga,Mg)O3- and La10(Si,Al)6O27- based electrolyte membranes. In \nselected cases, roles of oxygen diffusivity, states of the transition metal cations \nrelevant for the electronic transport, catalytically active additives and doped \nceria protective interlayers introduced in the model electrochemical cells were \nassessed. The correlations between transport properties of the electrode \nmaterials and electrochemical behavior of porous electrodes showed that the \nprincipal factors governing anode performance include, in particular, electronic \nconduction of the anode compositions and cation interdiffusion between the \nelectrodes and solid electrolytes. The latter is critically important for the silicate-\nbased electrolyte membranes, leading to substantially worse anode properties \ncompared to the electrochemical cells with lanthanum gallate solid electrolyte. \nThe results made it possible to select several anode compositions exhibiting \nlower area-specific electrode resistivity compared to known analogues, such as \n(La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-?. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nTable of contents \n\n \n\nIntroduction           9 \n \n\nChapter 1.

Consequently, \n\nreducing the operation temperature of the fuel cell is one of priority tasks. Since significant performance \n\nlosses originate from insufficient electrochemical activity of the electrodes, especially pronounced at low \n\ntemperatures due to high activation energies of rate-determining processes, significant efforts are focused on \n\nthe search of optimum electrode compositions exhibiting high and stable performance. Conventional Ni-\n\ncontaining composite anodes suffer from chemical, mechanical and microstructural instability [1, 2, 4, 7] \n\nwhich requires search of alternative materials possessing high and stable performance. In last years, selected \n\nperovskite compositions have been proposed as promising candidates capable to substitute the cermets for \n\nelectrochemical applications [8-13]. However, the information on relationships between the anode material \n\ncomposition, its functional characteristics and electrochemical activity is scarce and contradictive. \n\nAs discussed in Chapter 1, the choice of materials is restricted to oxide-based compositions, \n\nprimarily those with the perovskite-like structure. The selection of the objects is associated with the stability, \n\nthermomechanical, transport and electrochemical characteristics of the materials as well a wide variety of \n\ndopants capable to modify their properties and optimize the anode behavior. Moreover, recent studies \n\nrevealed a potential of so-called \u201csymmetric cells\u201d with the cathode and anode composed of the same \n\nmaterial, in SOFC technology [9, 14]. In particular, fewer number of the materials utilized facilitates the \n\nprocedure of the cell preparation, reduces the costs and enables to switch the cathode and anode atmosphere \n\nin order to eliminate carbonaceous species deposited in hydrocarbon-containing atmospheres while periodical \n\nalternation of p(O2) and current direction might avoid irreversible degradation of the electrode layer. \n\nWhile promising characteristics have been observed on (La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-?, (La,Sr)(Ti,Mn)O3-?, \n\n(La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-?, (La,Sr)(Cr,Ni)O3-?, (La,Sr)(Cr,Ru)O3-? anodes [8, 10, 15-18], in most studies the anodes \n\nwere covered with catalytically-active metal pastes which can barely be utilized in industrial scale. On the \n\nother hand, the presence of the additional layer obscures the electrochemical properties relevant to the oxide \n\nmaterial and does not allow to evaluate the relationships between the anode performance and the bulk \n\nproperties of the anode material. Selected compositions, such as Nb-doped manganites, are suggested to \n\npossess acceptable anode properties [19, 20], although no reports on their electrochemical behavior have \n\nbeen found. In a search of potential anode materials, the present study is focused on characterization and \n\nevaluation of the electrode activity of the relative compositions, such as (La,Sr)(Mn,Cr,Ti)O3-?, \n\n(La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-?, Sr(Mn,Nb)O3-?, (La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-?, (La,Sr)(Cr,Mg,Ni)O3-? and corresponding \n\ncomposites. \n\nAnother strategy of the work is to evaluate the potential of lanthanum silicate-based materials as \n\nsolid electrolytes in SOFCs. In recent years this group of compositions with apatite-type structure has \n\nreceived much attention due to their satisfactory transport characteristics and low costs [21-24]. However, the \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\navailable information on electrochemical properties of apatite-based cells is scarce and requires further \n\ninvestigations, especially in terms of the long-term stability. \n\nThe present study is focused on synthesis, characterization and assessment of the electrode activity \n\nof perovskite-type chromite-, manganite- and titanate-based compositions and studying the relationships \n\nbetween the electrode properties and functional characteristics. With respect to the goals indicated above, the \n\nparticular tasks are as follows: \n\n1. Analysis of available data on the functional characteristics and electrochemical properties of \n\nchromite-, manganite- and titanate-based compositions. \n\n2. Characterization of perovskite-like (La,Sr)(Mn,Cr,Ti)O3-?, (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-?, Sr(Mn,Nb)O3-?, \n\n(La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-?, (La,Sr)(Cr,Mg,Ni)O3-? as potential electrode materials. Evaluation of \n\nelectrochemical activity and stability of the perovskite-based cathodes and anodes. \n\n3. Comparative assessment of the anode activity of cermet or oxide-based anodes in contact with \n\napatite- and gallate-based solid electrolytes, evaluation of performance-determining factors. \n\n4. Analysis of the correlation between stability, transport, thermomechanical properties of perovskite-\n\nbased materials and performance of the corresponding anodes. \n\nIn accordance with the tasks of the study, the work is composed of five chapters. Chapter 1 is \n\ndevoted to a survey of the available literature data on the possible groups of SOFC anode materials based on \n\nthe binary oxides or oxide-based compositions, primarily with the perovskite-type structure. The stability and \n\ntransport properties of the potential anode materials under operation conditions restrict their choice to \n\nchromites, titanates, selected manganites stabilized by introduction of donor-like cations as well as to some \n\nrepresentatives of double perovskites, primarily based on molybdates. The overview of the electrode \n\nmaterials involves the consideration of the phase and structural relationships, mixed electronic and ionic \n\nconductivities, thermomechanical characteristics, analysis of the electrochemical behavior and the \n\napplicability of the corresponding anodes for practical utilization in hydrogen or natural gas-based fuels. \n\nPossible limitations associated with specific features of the given group of materials are considered as well. \n\nThe description of the experimental techniques, characteristics of the apparatus used, methods of \n\nsynthesis of the materials studied and fabrication of the electrode layers is presented in Chapter 2. In this part \n\nthe methods of calculation of physico-chemical parameters and routes of the treatment of the experimental \n\ndata are also considered. \n\nChapters 3 and 4 are devoted to investigation of chromite- and manganite-based materials, \n\nrespectively. The characterization includes structural and microstructural studies, assessment of the phase \n\nrelationships associated with the behavior of the materials on thermal or redox cycling, evaluation of the \n\nparameters related to the mixed electronic and ionic conductivity. In terms of the electrode behavior, anodic \n\nand in some cases cathodic activity is considered, without any detailed analysis of the factors responsible for \n\nthe electrochemical properties, routes of optimization of the anode performance etc. \n\nChapter 5 is focused on comparison of the anode properties of mixed-oxide and some metal-ceramic \n\n(cermet) anodes, assessment of the relationships between the electrode behavior and stability or transport \n\nproperties of the anode/electrolyte materials. In order to provide more complete information on the \n\nphenomena related with the electrolyte utilized, a brief review of the stability and transport characteristics of \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\napatite- and gallate-based solid electrolytes known from the literature is presented. As a possible route to \n\noptimize the anode performance, selected electrode layers were impregnated with catalytically-active species; \n\nanother approach involved preliminary deposition of the protective ceria-based layers on the electrolyte \n\nsurface to avoid the interaction and cation exchange between the cell components. \n\nThe principal conclusions based on the results obtained are presented in a separate section. The \n\nsymbols and abbreviations, as well as the references used are listed in the end of the work. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\n1. Literature review. Functional properties of chromite-, manganite- and titanate-\n\nbased perovskite oxides for SOFC anode applications. \n\n \n1.1. Stability limits and transport properties of transition metal oxide compounds: a brief \n\noverview \n \n\nIn order to achieve high and stable performance of the SOFC, the anode material should satisfy a list \n\nof requirements. These, primarily, include chemical and microstructural stability under the operation and \n\nfabrication conditions, high electronic and ionic conductivity, chemical and thermomechanical compatibility \n\nwith solid electrolytes, high and stable electrochemical activity towards fuel oxidation and low cost [1-4]. By \n\nfar, no ideal compound or composite material has been found to satisfy all the requirements. \n\nIn literature, one can found a large number of studies devoted to development of anodes alternative \n\nto commonly used Ni-containing cermets, mainly based on complex oxides possessing the perovskite-type \n\nstructure. Prior to analyzing their behavior, it would be reasonable to consider some of characteristics of \n\nindividual oxides, since the properties of the binary compounds may have a strong influence on the \n\ncharacteristics of their derivatives. Moreover, some of the individual oxides satisfy most of the requirements \n\nto the anodes and may be considered as the electrode component or a precursor for the electrode fabrication. \n\nThe advantage of individual oxides relates to their low cost and simplicity of production. Numerous \n\noxides possess mixed electronic and ionic conduction which is beneficial for the electrochemical \n\napplications. Unfortunately, direct comparison of the functional characteristics, primarily conductivity and \n\nvapour pressure under operating conditions, is complicated due to poor availability of the literature data. \n\nThe comparison will be restricted by 3d, 4d and 5d transition metals and selected representatives of \n\n4f elements. The most s- and p-elements are stable in an unique oxidation state ([25, 26] and references cited) \n\nand an acceptable level of the electronic conduction in these elements may be expected only in metallic state \n\nwhich cannot be attained under the anode environments. Another concern relates to a high tendency of these \n\nelements to form volatile products, especially in wet atmospheres [26-29]. \n\nMost oxides of elements of IIB, IIIB, IVB groups (Sc2O3, Y2O3, ZrO2, ZnO etc.) as well as 4f- and \n\n5f-elements are also stable in their maximum oxidation state in a wide domain of conditions [25, 26], with \n\nresultant negative effect on the electron transfer. Therefore, their transport properties are mainly determined \n\nby the presence of defects or impurities in the crystal lattice rather than by intrinsic properties of the parent \n\noxide. On the other hand, these oxides and their derivatives may offer a relatively high level of the ionic \n\nconductivity [26, 30, 31]. Utilization of oxides of 4f- and 5f-elements as anodes is limited by their low \n\navailability, high prices and, in case of 5f-elements, complexity of production and nuclear instability. \n\nMost elements of VIIIB group (Rh, Ru, Pt, Os, Ir, Pd) and IB group (Ag, Au) are characterized by \n\nstability in metallic state under a wide range of p(O2) [26, 32, 33]. Due to high electronic conductivity and, in \n\nsome cases, electrochemical activity, some representatives have been assessed as components of composite \n\nanodes [32-35]. However, industrial application of these metals is restricted by their high price, low \n\navailability, tendency of metallic particles towards sintering and adsorption/dissolution of hydrogen with \n\nresultant deterioration of the transport, mechanical or electrochemical characteristics [15, 36-38]. \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\nBeing stable under the anode conditions, metallic Fe, Co, Ni, Cu are susceptible to formation of \n\noxides at higher p(O2) [25, 39-42]; the corresponding conditions of the oxidation are shown in Fig. 1.1.1. \n\nWhile oxides with low oxygen content (FeO1\u00b1?, Cu2O1\u00b1? etc.) still possess an acceptable level of the \n\nelectronic conduction (Table 1.1.1), subsequent oxidation may deteriorate the transport properties and cause \n\nirreversible dimensional changes, microstructural degradation, etc. Another concern relates to fragility of Fe, \n\nCo, Ni in H2 atmosphere [57-59]. \n\nMnO1\u00b1? is stable in a wide domain of conditions  including the anode atmosphere. The composition \n\nexhibits the p-n transition in a broad p(O2) range (~10\n-10-10-4) atm [26] and an occasional oxidation is \n\nassumed not to influence critically the transport behavior. On the other hand, oxidation of MnO1\u00b1? into \n\nMn3O4\u00b1? occurring at 10\n-10-10-11 atm at 1073 K (Fig. 1.1.1) is undesirable since  the formation of the new \n\nphase may cause strong and irreversible volume changes. The processing conditions of MnO1\u00b1?-based anodes \n\nare restricted by low melting point of metallic Mn (~1473 K at 10-19 atm [25]); this factor should also be \n\naccounted for when operating with unstable Mn-based compositions which produce MnO1\u00b1? under reducing \n\nconditions. At the same time, at small amounts of MnO1\u00b1? phase, the formation of the liquid phase may \n\nensure the adhesion of the electrode to electrolyte. This indicates the preferability of manganites compared \n\nwith pure MnO1\u00b1?. \n\n \n\n0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1\n\n-26\n\n-20\n\n-14\n\n-8\n\n-20\n\n-15\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\nlo\ng \n\np(\nO\n\n2)\n (\n\nat\nm\n\n)\n\n0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1\n\n103/T, K-1\n\n-28\n\n-23\n\n-18\n\n-13 Ti2O3/ Ti3O5 [43]\nMn3O4/MnO [39]\n\nMnO/Mn [40]\nFe3O4/FeO [41]\n\nFeO/Fe [41]\nCoO/Co [41]\nNiO/Ni [41]\nCu2O/Cu [25]\n\nLa0.85Sr0.15CrO3-?

The \n\nconductivity is essentially p(O2)-independent under oxidizing and moderately reducing conditions due to \n\nsmall variations of the oxygen content. At low oxygen partial pressures, the determination of the conductivity \n\nis complicated by a strong volatility of Cr-containing compounds and a slow equilibration between the solid \n\nand gas phase. Moreover, the conductivity behavior is strongly affected by the presence of donor- and \n\nacceptor-type impurities in Cr2O3; examples are shown in Table 1.1.2. Whatever the transport mechanism, \n\nbasically the conductivity of Cr2O3-based materials does not exceed 1 S/cm which is insufficient for the \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nanode applications. Another concern is related with the vaporization of chromia-based compounds; this \n\nphenomenon and related problems will be discussed in Chapter 1.2.7. \n\nA promising group of oxides for potential anode applications is represented by Ti, V, Nb, W oxides. \n\nUnder extremely reducing conditions and elevated temperatures shown in Fig. 1.1.1, oxides TiO1\u00b1?, VO1\u00b1?, \n\nNbO1\u00b1? exhibit a metallic-like conduction, while in anode environments TiOx, VOx, NbOx and WOx are n-\n\ntype conductors; both mechanisms are favorable for electrochemical applications. Similar to Cr2O3, the \n\nconductivity is strongly dependent of the presence of impurities in the cation sublattice. At the same time, the \n\npractical utilization of this group of oxides as well as studying their transport characteristics is complicated \n\nby a large variety of phases existing at different M:O ratio [26, 42, 66, 68, 69]. The phase transitions on \n\noxidation (Fig. 1.1.1) are accompanied by strong irreversible drops of the conductivity (Fig. 1.1.2) and \n\ndimensional changes. Interaction of V-, Nb-, Ta-containing phases with hydrogen causes the deterioration of \n\nmechanical properties (toughness, plasticity) [59, 70, 71]. \n\n \n\n-18 -12 -6 0\n\nlog p(O2) (atm)\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nlo\ng \n\n?\n (\n\nS\n/c\n\nm\n)\n\nWOx, 1023 K [68]\n\nNbOx, 1373 K [66]A\n\n \nFig. 1.1.2. Variation of total conductivity of NbOx and WOx on isothermal oxidation/reduction \n\n \n\nAmong 4f-elements, one may emphasize the behavior of CeO2-? and its derivatives due to promising \n\ncombination of the stability, electronic and ionic transport properties and catalytic activity towards \n\nelectrochemical processes. Pure and doped CeO2-? have been widely studied as individual anodes or as \n\ncomponents of anode composites. Detailed characterization of the oxides may be found elsewhere [72-75]. \n\nOne of the most critical disadvantages of doped CeO2-? for anode applications is insufficient electronic \n\nconductivity which requires the presence of metallic phase in the composite, and a high chemical expansivity \n\non redox cycling which necessitates lowering its fraction in anodes [74, 76, 77]. \n\nThe domain of operation conditions for most d-element oxides is restricted by the formation of \n\nvolatile compounds. As evaluated by Sfeir at al. [44], the losses of a substance can be considered significant, \n\nif the partial pressure of volatile species exceeds 10-8 atm. The volatilization is essentially critical for Cu-, \n\nAg-, Au-, MoOx- and WOx-containing anodes [27, 28, 78-80]. At the presence of VOx- and Cr2O3-based \n\nphases, an oxidation of the anode material in wet atmosphere should be avoided [78, 79, 81-85]. In some \n\nextent, the volatilization of Mn-, Fe-, Co-, Ni-containing compounds might be problematic [27, 78, 80], \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\nwhile electrodes containing NbOx phase should be operated at temperatures lower than 1573-1673 K [86]. \n\nApart from the loss of the material, the vaporization may result in microstructural degradation, especially for \n\nliquid phase-assisted processes. Subsequent precipitation of the volatile species into the electrode porous \n\nstructure may block the pores or cause mechanical failure of the layer, while deposition from the gas phase \n\nonto the surface of other components of the cell may cause their poisoning; examples of chromia-related \n\ncontamination will be presented in Chapter 1.2.7. \n\nThe functional characteristics of individual oxides may be modified by appropriate doping with \n\ndonor- or acceptor-type cations. Among this group of materials, CeO2- and ZrO2-based materials have \n\nreceived much attention, since due to their adequate ionic conductivity, thermomechanical properties, \n\ncontribution into the electrochemical processes, etc., the related oxides may be utilized both as electrolytes \n\nand constituents of the composite electrodes ([73, 87-89] and references cited). As for other oxide-based \n\nmaterials, one should mention the studies on NbOx-, TiOx-based solid solutions [90-92] which properties are, \n\nhowever, strongly affected by the processing conditions. Although their electrochemical activity has been \n\nreported to be insufficient for practical applications, one should not underestimate the potential of this type of \n\nmaterials since a wide choice of dopants enables to find an optimum combination of the stability, transport \n\nand mechanical properties. \n\nWide possibilities may be achieved by fabrication of oxide-based compositions with the structure of \n\nperovskite-related phases, spinels, pyrochlores, etc. Among possible combinations of mixed oxides \n\ncomposed of large-size cations in so-called A-sublattice (mainly alkali-earth or rare-arth cations) and small \n\ncations in B-sublattice (transition metal cations), we will briefly consider Ti-, Mn-, Fe-, Ni-, Co- Ti-, Nb- and \n\nW-based composition where the molar ratio A:B differs from 1. Characteristics of selected compositions in \n\nterms of stability, conductivity and electrode activity are presented in Fig. 1.1.1 and Tables 1.1.2, 1.1.3. \n\nAlthough the reduction stability of manganites, ferrites and other oxides with Ruddlesden-Popper \n\n(RP) structure (Ln,A)n+1BnOx (where Ln is rare-earth metal, A is an alkali-earth metal and B is a transition \n\nmetal element) is somewhat improved in comparison with perovskite analogues (Fig. 1.1.1), the level of the \n\nelectronic and ionic conductivity is rather small to consider these materials as anodes [48, 93-95]. \n\n(La,Ca,Sr,Ba)0.6NbO3-?-based phases with tungsten bronzes-like structure generally exhibit sufficient level of \n\nthe electronic conductivity which may even be superior compared with corresponding perovskites [96-98]. \n\nHowever, the performance of the bronze anodes studied in [98] is poor, while the problems associated with \n\nstability, interaction with YSZ, oxygen diffusion limitations associated with ordering phenomena due to high \n\ncation vacancy concentration, and extremely low TEC values [98] significantly constrict their utilization. \n\nRegardless these disadvantages, some research in the field of electrochemical characteristics of perovskite-\n\nrelated layered phases and tetragonal bronzes has been carried out [95, 99-101]. \n\nPylochlore-type materials (Gd,Ca)2Ti2O7-? might be considered as an alternative to titanate \n\nperovskites due to their high stability in a wide p(O2) range which ensures their tolerance towards oxidation. \n\nThe materials exhibit dominant oxygen ionic conductivity, while the comparatively low electronic \n\ncontribution and catalytic activity necessitate distribution of metallic phases, ceria-based compositions, \n\nsurface modification, etc. [108-102]. \n\n \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\nTable 1.1.2.

Analysis of the low-p(O2) \n\nstability limits (Fig. 1.1.1) restricts the choice of the perovskite-type anode materials to chromites, titanates, \n\nmolybdates and vanadates. Moreover, appropriate doping of ferrites and manganites with a cation which \n\nensures the low-p(O2) stability without substantial deterioration of the transport and catalytic properties \n\nenables to consider these compounds as another group of potential anode materials. \n\nAmong the perovskite compounds, in the present study the primarily attention will be focused on \n\nchromite, titanate and manganite groups, since ferrites and cobaltites are insufficiently stable in fuel \n\nconditions [46-49]. Some authors report application of thermodynamically unstable perovskites such as \n\n(La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-? as SOFC anodes [101] or catalysts for hydrocarbon oxidation [118, 121]. One should \n\nnote, however, that the requirements for catalyst materials differ from those to anodes, in particular in terms \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\nof the electrocatalytic activity, compatibility with solid electrolytes, etc, while catalysts can generally be \n\nprepared and replaced by a simpler technology which imposes less stringent requirements to their stability. \n\nAnother large group of potential anodes includes vanadate-based perovskites [110, 111, 122] and \n\nthe perovskites with large fraction (?50 mol.%) of V, Mo, Nb. In particular, attractive characterisctics have \n\nbeen reported for A2(B,Mo)O6-? ordered perovskites, where A is alkali-earth metal and B corresponds to Mg \n\nor transition metal cation [123-126]. Perovskite-type materials containing V, Mo, Nb etc. cations are \n\nregarded especially promising when working with S-containing fuels; however, their mechanical and \n\ntransport characteristics are strongly susceptable to redox cycling [20, 111, 117, 127-130].  Nevertheless, a \n\nmoderate content of these cations in chromites and manganites may ensure the optimum combination of the \n\nfunctional properties; the related compositions will be considered in the following sections. \n\n \n\n1.2. Chromite-based perovskite solid solutions \n \n\n1.2.1. Solubility of dopants \n\n \nSolid solutions of perovskite LnCrO3-? are formed for Ln = La - Lu, Y, except for cerium which \n\nforms chromites stable only under reducing conditions [131]. In La2O3 - Cr2O3 system, LaCrO3-? is the only \n\nsingle phase compound [132]. The perovskite chromites of various lanthanides are similar to each other and \n\nare characterized by a relatively narrow field of the forming solid solutions [131]. The stability of LnCrO3-? \n\ndecreases with lowering Ln ionic radius; the trend is especially obvious under reducing conditions [17]. \n\nAlkaline-earth cations are most common dopants for chromites, mainly due to their acting as \n\nelectron acceptors on the Ln or Cr sites and resultant contribution to the p-type electronic conductivity. \n\nAmong dopants, Ca, Sr and in some cases Ba were studied as A-site substitutions. Mg is more appropriate for \n\nB-site doping due to its smaller radius [133]. In accordance with [44, 132, 134], the solubility of Ca in \n\nLaCrO3-? varies from 12% at 923 K to 50% at 1673 K. Single phase perovskites may be synthesized at \n\n(La+Ca)/Cr ratio in the range of 0.96 - 1.04 [135]. Annealing at p(O2) = 10\n-9 atm at 1873 K decreases the \n\nsolubility limit down to 22% [132]; the worse stability of (La,Ca)CrO3-? at low p(O2) is confirmed in [134]. \n\nConsidering other lanthanide chromites, Ln1-xCaxCrO3-? is stable at 0?x?0.4 for Ln = Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Y; \n\n0?x?0.2 for Ln = Tb and 0?x?0.15 for Ln = Yb ([131, 136] and references therein). \n\nAn excess of Ca results in formation of La2O3, CaO, CaCrO4, Ca3(CrO4)2, Ca5(CrO4)3OH in air [44, \n\n132]. The phases La2O3, CaO, ?-CaCr2O4, Ca(CrO2)4 and RP-chromites ((La,Sr)2CrO4, (La.Sr)3Cr2O7, \n\n(La,Sr)4Cr3O10) were identified in Ca-rich (La,Ca)CrO3-? under reducing conditions [132]. Strong oxidation \n\nof (La,Ca)CrO3-? causes formation of Cr\n6+ species on the surface and segregation of La2CrO6 and Cam(CrO4)n \n\nphases. The process is promoted by higher Ca content, lower temperature and higher p(O2) [132, 137, 138]. \n\nSr is assessed to have worse solubility in LaCrO3-? than Ca, consistently with larger difference in \n\nionic radii between La and alkali-earth cation. The data on solubility limit of Sr are more scattered, possibly \n\ndue to discrepancies in the preparation procedure or slower equilibration in La2O3-SrO-Cr2O3 system \n\ncompared with Ca-containing analogues [132, 139]. The latter factor can be attributed to smaller ionic radii \n\nand higher mobility of Ca cations [133, 140]. As reported by Peck et al. [139], Sr is soluble up to 10% at \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\n1223 K in air, while other authors indicated a higher solubility of Sr: 15% at 1073 K [141] and 20% at 1173 \n\nK [138]. After sintering at elevated temperatures (1673 K) and subsequent quenching, the solubility limit of \n\nSr increases up to 25% [44, 139]. Ln1-xSrxCrO3-? are single phase perovskites at 0?x?0.15 for Ln=Pr, Eu and \n\n0?x?0.05 for Ln = Tb, Y [131]. In opposite to Ca-doped chromites, Sr solubility is reported to increase on \n\nreduction from 10% in air to 31% at 10-9 atm (under strong vacuum conditions) [44, 139]; however, one \n\nshould account for large difference between the synthesis temperature in both studies. The authors attribute \n\nthe improved stability under low p(O2) to formation of RP-chromites which achieve a fast equilibrium with \n\nthe perovskite phase, in contrast to SrCrO4 and Sr2.67(CrO4)2 phases dominant in air. The dominant secondary \n\nphases in La1-xSrxCrO3-? are SrCrO4, Sr2.67Cr2O8, La16Cr7O44, Sr5(CrO4)3OH in air [44, 139] and La2Sr2O5, \n\nLa4SrO7, Sr2CrO4, Sr(CrO2)2, Sr(CrO2)4 and RP-chromites at low p(O2) [139, 142]. \n\nFormation of single phase perovskites Ln1-xBaxCrO3-? was observed at 0?x?0.1 for Ln = La, Pr; \n\n0?x?0.05 for Ln = Eu, Gd, Tb, Y [131, 143]. The low solubility of Ba may be attributed to both large \n\ndifference in ionic radii between Ba and Ln cations and high stability of BaCrO4 and BaCr2O4 phases which \n\nare frequently present as impurities in Ba-rich chromites [143, 144]. \n\nGenerally, LnCrO3-? are orthorhombic perovskites exhibiting a phase transition into the \n\nrhombohedral structure at ~563 K; no transition up to at least 1173 K was observed on PrCrO3-?, NdCrO3-?, \n\nSmCrO3-?, YCrO3-? [131, 145-147]. Ca-doping allows to increase the transition temperature [131, 148]; this is \n\nconsistent with the similarity of Ca2+ and La3+ ionic radii. Increasing Ca content in La1-xCaxCrO3-? up to x = \n\n0.5 is predicted to produce the cubic perovskite structure [135]. Introduction of large Sr and Ba atoms \n\nreduces the temperature of the orthorhombic-rhombohedral transition and promote the stabilization of the \n\nrhombohedral structure ( 3R c ) at room temperatures [131, 143, 149]. \n\nDue to the small radius, Mg is incorporated into B-sublattice; attempts to obtain A-site substituted \n\n(Ln,Mg)CrO3-? result in formation of MgCr2O4 spinel [143]. Depending on Ln cation radius and preparation \n\nconditions, the solubility limit of Mg in LnCr1-xMgxO3-? is assessed to be 0?x?0.4 ([131] and references \n\ntherein). For LaCr1-xMgxO3-? the maximum Mg content was found to be 46% in air and 7.5% at p(O2) = 10\n-16 \n\natm at 1573 K [142], while for NdCrO3-? the limit is 25% at 1173 K [150]. At least 20% of Mg can be \n\nintroduced into La0.8Sr0.2Cr1-xMgxO3-? [151]. An excessive Mg content may cause precipitation of MgO phase \n\nat the grain boundaries [142]. Under reducing conditions, Mg solubility in LaCrO3-? is evaluated as >10% \n\n[17]. Mg-doped chromites generally possess the orthorhombic struture [142, 150] transforming into the \n\nrhombohedral symmetry on reduction [112]. \n\nThe series of La0.9Ca0.1Cr1-xAlxO3-? with 0?x?0.9 was studied in the p(O2) region 10\n-21 - 1 atm [152], \n\nwhile the electrochemical properties of La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Al0.5O3-? were studied in air and in wet 5% H2 [9], with \n\nno emphasis on the phase stability. In YbCrO3-? Al is soluble up to 0.35 [131]. Doping with Al enables to \n\nstabilize the rhombohedral structure at low temperatures [153, 154]. \n\nTi has unlimited solubility in B-sublattice of (La,A)(Cr,Ti)O3-? (A = Ca, Sr), provided that the \n\nintroduction of Ti is compensated by appropriate acceptor doping or creation of A-site vacancies [155-157]. \n\nAt Ca:Ti&lt;1, the formation of secondary intergrowth phase Lan(Ti,Cr)nO3n+2 can be observed. The materials \n\nare orthorhombic perovskites (S.G.: Pbnm) for Ca(Sr) and Ti content lower than 60 - 70 mol.% [156, 158] \n\nand exhibit a stability at least down to 10-21 atm, with Ti solubility increasing on reduction [146, 155, 159]. \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\nAt least 5 mol. % of V can be doped into La0.85Sr0.15Cr1-xVxO3-? [160] and La0.8Ca0.15Sr0.05Cr1-xVxO3-? \n\n[161] forming perovskites with rhombohedrally-distorted structure. The solubility of V may be enhanced by \n\nreduction or acceptor doping. The formation of single phase Ce0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5V0.5O3-? under low p(O2) with \n\ntetragonal structure was reported. However, high V content may induce phase transitions on oxidation or \n\nreduction, detrimental for the electrochemical applications [162]. An excess of V in (La,A)(Cr,V)O3-? (A = \n\nCa, Sr) causes formation of A3(VO4)2-based phases [160, 161, 163]. \n\nMn, Fe and Co have been reported to have unlimited solubility in LaCrO3-? or in (La,A)CrO3-? under \n\natmospheric conditions and with moderate amount of alkali-earth dopants [131, 164-166]. The composition \n\nLaCr0.8Co0.2O3-? was shown to consist of a mixture of orthorhombic LaCrO3-?- and rhombohedral LaCoO3-?-\n\nbased phases [167], while at other ratios Cr/Co single phase perovskites are produced. Similar mixtures of the \n\northorhombic and rhombohedral phases were found for LaCr0.4Mn0.6O3-? [168] and for \n\nLa0.33Sr0.67Cr0.33Fe0.67O3-? [169]. \n\nMn-, Fe-, Co-substituted chromites are unstable towards high content of alkali-earth dopants or \n\noxygen deficiency. Depending on the cation composition, the stability limits may be located close to anodic \n\nconditions. In most studies, the decomposition or low-p(O2) equilibration is hindered kinetically which \n\nresults in discrepancies between the literature data on the phase stability or crystal structure. As an example, \n\na precipitation of metallic Co from LaCr0.9Co0.1O3-? at 10\n-18 - 10-16 atm at 1273 K was reported [146], while \n\nno decomposition of La0.7Ca0.3Cr0.8Co0.2O3-? was detected under similar conditions [170], although the high \n\nquantities of Ca and Co should destabilize the structure. While LaCr0.5Mn0.5O3-? exhibits a separation of \n\ntraces of La2O3 in wet H2 [171], (La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-? are stable in typical anode atmospheres [8, 10], despite \n\nthe expected destabilization induced by introduction of Sr. \n\nLaCr1-xMnxO3-? preserve the orthorhombically-distorted structure for 0?x?0.5, while for x?0.7 the \n\nmaterial adopts the rhombohedral symmetry [168, 171]. The data on the crystal structure of reduced LaCr1-\n\nxMnxO3-? are scarce due to insufficient phase stability; according to Deleebeck et al. [171], in wet H2 \n\nLaCr0.5Mn0.5O3-? becomes cubic. LaCr1-xFexO3-? perovskites form a series of solid solutions with \n\northorhombic crystal lattice in air, typical for both end members [172, 173]. \n\nIncreasing Co content in LaCr1-xCoxO3-? above x = 0.25 causes rhombohedral distortion of the \n\nstructure [167, 173]; the behavior of Mn- or Co-doped chromites is consistent with the symmetry of \n\northorhombic LaCrO3-? and rhombohedral LaMnO3-? and LaCoO3-? [49, 131, 174, 175]. The orthorhombic \n\nand rhombohedral structure is preserved on reduction of LaCr1-xCoxO3-? with 0?x?0.15 and 0.25?x?0.4, \n\ncorrespondingly, while for 0.5?x?0.8, high oxygen losses induce formation of cubic perovskites [167]. \n\nSimilar to (La,Sr)CrO3-?, La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.9B0.1O3-? (B = Mn, Fe, Co) are rhombohedral perovskites \n\n[176]. Increasing Mn content up to 50 mol. % preserves the rhombohedral structure [9, 113, 131, 177], while \n\nfor Fe-doped analogues, the symmetry transforms into the orthorhombic one [9, 178]. \n\nA gradual phase transition rhombohedral-cubic is observed for La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? at 770 - \n\n1270 K [177]. The rhombohedral structure of La1-xSrxCr0.5Mn0.5O3-? with x = 0.2 is maintained on reduction \n\nin wet 5% H2, while the compositions with x = 0.25 and x = 0.3 exhibit a transformation into the \n\northorhombic and cubic structure, respectively [113]. La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Fe0.5O3-? is orthorhombic in air. On \n\nreduction, traces of metallic Fe can be detected, while the perovskite adopts the rhombohedral symmetry [9, \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\n178]. Increasing Cr content in La0.3Sr0.7Fe1-xCrxO3-? above 33% may induce formation of SrCrO4. Subsequent \n\nreduction results in dissolution of SrCrO4 phase, with simultaneous formation of Fe(Fe,Cr)2O4 spinel and \n\nprecipitation of metallic Fe [169, 179]. \n\nNi has a limited solubility in chromites which increases at lower T and higher p(O2) [131]. The \n\ncomposition with ~60 mol. % of Ni was found to consist of LaCrO3-?- and LaNiO3-?-based phases [180]. In \n\nLnCr1-xNixO3-? (Ln = Gd, Yb), Ni can be dissolved up to x = 0.15 [131]. The stability of La(Cr,Ni)O3-? under \n\nreducing conditions is reported for 50 - 60 mol.% of Ni at 1173 - 1273 K [181, 182], although the phase may \n\nbe stabilized kinetically. LaCr1-xNixO3-? are orthorombic perovskites at x<0.6 and rhombohedral at x>0.7 at \n\nroom temperature [181]. The phase transition shifts to lower temperatures on Ni-doping [183]. Introduction \n\nof A-site acceptor-type dopants and/or reduction decrease the solubility of Ni in (Ln,A)(Cr,Ni)O3-? down to \n\n10 - 20 mol. % [184, 185]. Reduction induces subsequent lowering of Ni solubility, although the \n\ndetermination of exact values is difficult due to kinetic reasons. The formation of submicron Ni particles at \n\nlow p(O2) is important in terms of potential electrochemical applications [17, 184, 186]. For La1-xSrxCr1-\n\nyNiyO3-?, the transition orthorombic-rhombohedral occurs at x = 0.2 - 0.25 and y = 0.05 - 0.1 under ambient \n\nconditions [176, 187]. \n\nSimilar to Ni-doped chromites, an attention was attracted by Ru-containing analogues due to their \n\nelectrocatalytic activity. Up to 20 - 25 mol.% of Ru can be accommodated by La0.8Sr0.2Cr1-xRuxO3-? [15, 188]. \n\n \n\n1.2.2. Key defect chemistry mechanisms \n\n \n\nThe basic relationships of the defect chemistry of chromites can be found elsewhere [134, 146, 189, \n\netc.]. Here, 3 simplified possibilities will be considered which include (La,A)CrO3-? and La(Cr,B)O3-? \n\nperovskites where A and B are dopant cations with a fixed oxidation state, and La(Cr,B)O3-? where B is a \n\ntransition metal cation with variable valence.  \n\nReplacement of 3-fold charged lanthanum cations \nLa\n\nLa\n\u00d7 with 2-fold charged cations of the dopant \n\nLa\nA?  necessitates charge compensation realized by formation of equivalent amount of oxygen vacancies \n\nO\nV\nii or increasing the fraction of Cr4+ species (\n\nCr\nCr\n\ni ). Therefore, the predominant defects in La1-xAxCrO3-? are \n\nLa\nA? , \n\nO\nV\nii  and \n\nCr\nCr\n\ni . The distribution of the defects in the chromite crystal lattice is considered to be random, \n\nin accordance with [152, 190], while no structural transitions are taken into account. Although in literature \n\none can find a possibility of existence of chromium or oxygen interstitials or cation vacancies ([131, 191, \n\n192] and references cited) in chromites, these aspects will not be addressed. \n\nThe charge compensation via formation of \nCr\n\nCr\ni  species is realized in a wide p(O2) range, including \n\nthe atmospheric conditions, while the formation of oxygen vacancies dominates at lower p(O2). The \n\nrelationship between the defects can thus be expressed by equation of charge conservation: 2? + p = x, where \n\n?, p and x correspond to the concentration of \nO\n\nV\nii , \n\nCr\nCr\n\ni  and \nLa\n\nA? , respectively. Taking into account lattice site \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\nconservation condition, the concentration of \nCr\n\nCr\n\u00d7  and \n\nO\nO\n\n\u00d7  may be expressed as (1-p) and (3-?), respectively. \n\nThe oxygen exchange between the perovskite and gas phase induced by reduction of the material may be \n\ndescribed by equation \n\n \n\n\u00d7 \u00d7\n2 O Cr O Cr1/2O +V 2Cr O 2Cr+ = +\n\nii i\n\n  (Eq. 1.2.1) \n\n \n\nTaking into account the conditions of charge and lattice site conservation, the equilibrium constant of the \n\nprocess described by Eq. (1.2.1) may be formulated as \n\n \n\n2 2\n1/ 2 2 3\n\n1 2 2\n1 4\n\n3 2\n(O )\n\n1 2\n\nx\nK p\n\nx\n\n? ?? ?\n\n? ? ? ?\n? ? ?? ?? ?\n\n= ? ?? ?\n? +? ?? ?\n\n  (Eq. 1.2.2) \n\n \n\nwhere \n1\n\n? ,\n2\n\n? ,\n3\n\n? ,\n4?  correspond to the activity coefficients of CrCr\n\n\u00d7 ,\nCr\n\nCr\ni ,\n\nO\nO\n\n\u00d7 and\nO\n\nV\nii . Due to the high ionic \n\nstrength in the crystal [189], the activity coefficients are considered independent of the defect concentrations.  \n\nEq. (1.2.2) assumes a linear relationship between log ? and log p(O2) for ?<<x/2, with the \n\nproportionality coefficient equal to -\u00bd, as shown on the inset in Fig. 1.2.1. Since variations of the oxygen \n\ndeficiency in oxidative atmospheres are below 10-2, the absolute value of the oxygen content is nearly p(O2)-\n\nindependent in a wide range of oxygen pressures. Therefore, the electronic conductivity in this domain of \n\np(O2) is essentially unaffected by reduction while the the ionic conduction and chemically-induced strains \n\nwhich are proportional to the deficiency, are low. Further reduction induces a gradual decrease of the oxygen \n\ncontent; the proportionality between log ? and log p(O2) is preserved. The onset of extensive oxygen losses is \n\ndetermined by the nature and amount of A-site dopants and by temperature, being shifted to more oxidative \n\nconditions on heating or increasing the dopant content. \n\nAs shown in Fig. 1.2.1, the oxygen losses observable on Ca- and Sr-doped chromites are close, with \n\n(La,Sr)CrO3-? exhibiting slightly larger oxygen deficiency [134, 190]. This may be attributed to a larger cell \n\nvolume of Sr-substituted chromites which facilitates the oxygen losses, or stronger tendency of rhombohedral \n\nstructure to the formation of oxygen vacancies. At extremely low p(O2), the dependence log ? vs. log p(O2) \n\ndeviates from the linearity, while the absolute value of oxygen content approaches the value corresponding to \n\ncomplete reduction of Cr into 3+. Obviously, for La1-xAxCrO3-? the limiting value of oxygen \n\nnonstoichiometry should be equal to x/2.  However, in practice, this saturation for most chromites occurs in a \n\nregion of extremely low p(O2) located beyond the experimental conditions (unless B-site substituted \n\nchromites are reduced) or stability domain of the perovskites. \n\nThe equilibrium constant in Eq.

Isothermal dependencies of oxygen \ncontent in selected B-site doped chromites vs. p(O2) \n\n \n\n \n\nOn approaching the low-p(O2) limit of the oxygen deficiency, the amount of \nCr\n\nCr\ni  becomes negligible in \n\ncomparison with \nO\n\nV\nii  and \n\nLa\nA? , while the concentration of \n\nCr\nCr\n\n\u00d7  is hardly affected by p(O2) variations. This \n\nyields a linear relationship p = k \u00d7 p(O2)\n1/4, where k is constant involving the equilibrium constant and \n\nequilibrium concentrations of \nLa\n\nA? , \nO\n\nO\n\u00d7  and \n\nCr\nCr\n\n\u00d7 . As shown in following sections, the electronic conductivity \n\nof chromites is determined by the population of Cr4+ species. Therefore, in the region of large oxygen losses, \n\na linear relationship between log ? and log p(O2) with the slope +1/4 is expected. \n\nIf LaCrO3-? is doped into B-sublattice by a 2-fold charged cation, with the oxidation state stable \n\nwithin the experimental conditions (i.e. Mg2+), the basic equations are similar to (La,Sr)CrO3-?. In accordance \n\nwith the coexistence of 3 types of species (Cr3+, Cr4+ and B2+), the equilibrium constant of the process Eq. \n\n(1.2.2) adopts the form (assuming that the activity coefficients are p(O2)-independent) \n\n2\n\n1/ 2\n1 2\n\n3 2\n(O )\n\n1 2 2\n\ny\nK p\n\ny\n\n? ?\n\n? ?\n? ? ?? ?? ?\n\n= ? ?? ?\n? +? ?? ?\n\n  (Eq. 1.2.4) \n\n \n\nThe similarity between Eqs. (1.2.2) and (1.2.4) assumes that the behaviour of Mg-doped chromites \n\nshould not essentially differ from that of A-site substituted (La,A)CrO3-? considered previously. The \n\nnonstoichiometry curve still exhibits 2 saturations and one continuous drop of oxygen content. Similar to the \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\n1st situation, the low-p(O2) saturation corresponds to complete reduction of Cr into 3+ state, with the \n\ncorresponding assymptotic value of oxygen deficiency equal to y/2. \n\nB-site doping induces larger variations of the oxygen content variations then substitutions into A-\n\nsublattice (Fig. 1.2.2). Even doping of cations with relatively high oxidation state accompanied by equivalent \n\nintroduction of acceptor-type dopants shifts the onset of oxygen losses to higher p(O2) [152, 191]. This may \n\nbe attributed to comparatively weak B-O bond strength and more significant destabilization of the structure \n\nby B-site doping. Obviously, replacement of Cr with cations stable with oxygen coordination lower than \n\noctahedral should increase the effect of the doping.  \n\nThe last case considered involves the situation when both B-site cations possess variable oxidation \n\nstate under working conditions. For simplicity, the situation when only 2 oxidation states can be realized for \n\nboth cations will be considered. Apart from the relationships valid for the previous situations, the transition \n\nmetal cations participate in the process of electrone exchange with the equilibrium constant \n\n \n\n* Cr Cr\n2 \u00d7\n\nCr Cr\n\n[B ][Cr ]\n=\n\n[B ][Cr ]\nK\n\n\u00d7\n\n? i   (Eq. 1.2.5) \n\n \n\nCombination of Eqs. (1.2.2) and (1.2.5) with modified conditions of lattice site and charge \n\nconcervation yields 6 equations with 6 variables. The system can be solved analytically, but the final \n\nexpression is rather complex. In practice, the proposed model is generally complicated by numerous factors; \n\namong those one may emphasize the following: \n\n1. Most d-elements may adopt more than 2 oxidation states, involving the process of charge \n\ndisproportionation under the experimental conditions [10, 191, 194]. \n\n2. Extensive oxygen losses may induce phase decomposition or structural transformations, while the \n\ncoexistence of 2 or more phases significantly affects the equilibration kinetics [146, 191]. \n\n3. The presence of lattice defects may impose constrictions on their cation or anion environment due to \n\nelectrostatic or steric factors [152]. \n\nIn some studies, the defect model of chromites doped with transition metals is simplified; the most \n\ncommon assumption relates to neglecting the electron exchange and considering chromium or the dopant \n\ncation to be stable in a definite oxidation state. Although this approach satisfactory describes the data \n\npresented in works [191, 196, 197], more studies on perovskite systems are required in order to make certain \n\nconclusions about the processes responsible for the behavior of doped chromites. \n\n \n\n1.2.3. Total conductivity \n\n \n\nThe conductivity in LnCrO3-? is essentially electronic; the ionic transference numbers are less than \n\n10-4 [131, 198]. The electronic transport in chromites proceeds by hopping electron holes along Me-O-Me \n\nnetwork in B-sublattice (p-type conductivity). Chromites are characterized by relatively strong electron \n\nlocalization on Cr atoms [199] which favors small polaron conduction and enhanced activation energies of \n\nthe hole mobility. In the absence of structural transformations, the isothermal conductivity should be \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\ngoverned by the population of charge carriers which is equivalent to the concentration of \nCr\n\nCr\ni . \n\nCorrespondingly, the basic trends shown in the previous section can be applied for characterization of the \n\nelectronic transport behavior. \n\nPreparation conditions strongly affect the transport properties. This may originate from incomplete \n\nsynthesis, oversintering, volatilization of Cr-containing species at high temperatures ([131, 134] and \n\nreferences therein). The scattering between the literature data is especially strong for undoped LnCrO3-?, \n\nwhere the content of charge carriers is mainly governed by the presence of impurities [200]. LaCrO3-?-based \n\nmaterials exhibit a degradation of the conductivity [141, 201], especially pronounced at low p(O2). \n\nLaCrO3-?-based perovskites generally exhibit larger conductivity under ambient conditions \n\ncompared with other lanthanides, as shown in Fig. 1.2.3. The conductivity of LnCrO3-? decreases in the row \n\nLa>Nd>Y>Sm [131]. This behavior correlates with the corresponding activation energies and is attributed to \n\nhigher overlapping integral of the d- and p-orbitals of chromium and oxygen atoms, respectively, and faster \n\nhole mobility for larger Ln radius. Kunifusa et al. [150] reported the conductivity of NdCrO3-? to be \n\nsignificantly higher compared with LaCrO3-? [199] and YCrO3-? [202], although the activation energy is \n\nminimum for LaCrO3-? (0.20 eV vs. 0.22 - 0.23 eV for other chromites). In some studies, a higher \n\nconductivity of PrCrO3-?-based perovskites in comparison with other LnCrO3-? analogues in air or under \n\nreducing conditions was reported [136, 184]. \n\nCe-containing chromites show a drastic change of the activation energy of the electronic \n\nconductivity in air with temperature (0.15 eV in low-temperature vs. 0.20 - 0.25 eV in the high-temperature \n\nregion) [203]. The difference in the slopes decreases on introducing Ca, presumably due to an effect of the \n\nequilibrium between Ce4+/3+ and Cr4+/3+ on variations of the temperature and resultant change of the content \n\nof mobile charge carriers, although the low stability of Ce-containing chromites in air and the possibility of \n\nthe phase transition should also be considered [131, 204]. \n\nThe conductivity of (Ln,A)CrO3-? where A is an alkali-earth metal gradually increases with the \n\nacceptor dopant amount. This trend is limited by separation of secondary  non-conductive phases at high \n\ndoping levels, in particular those containing Cr6+ species [132, 134, 139]. The conductivity of Ca-doped \n\nchromites is generally slightly higher as compared with Sr-doped analogues [112, 134, 143] (Fig. 1.2.3). Ba-\n\ndoping seems to result in strong lattice strains which hamper the electronic transfer [143] compared with Ca- \n\nor Sr-doped counterparts. This behavior is consistent with the ionic radii of the alkali-earth metals, with Ca \n\npossessing the radius close to that of La3+ and smaller resultant lattice distortions [133, 134, 143]. \n\nMg-doping enhances the conductivity, although the effect is smaller compared with Sr and Ca. \n\nApart from increasing the amount of p-type charge carriers, introduction of Mg results in lower content of Cr \n\natoms available for the electron transfer and blocks Cr-O-Cr bonds [114, 134]. \n\nAl-doping suppresses the conduction of chromites due to blocking of conductive Cr-O-Cr paths and \n\nby facilitating oxygen removal from chromites on reduction [152, 153, 205]. On the other hand, Al-doping \n\ninto acceptor-rich chromites should increase the amount of Cr4+ species. As an example, introduction of 12 \n\nmol. % of Al into La0.75Ca0.25Cr0.92-xCo0.08AlxO3-? slightly enhances the conductivity in air and reduces the Ea \n\ndown to 0.11 eV [154], possibly due to structural factors. \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\n0.0\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n1.2\n\n1.6\n\nlo\ng \n\n?\n (\n\nS\n/c\n\nm\n)\n\n-0.6\n\n0.0\n\n0.6\n\n1.2\n\n1.8\n\nLaCrO3-?

Temperature dependencies of total conductivity of chromites in air \n\n \n\nThe effect of introduction of transition metal (Mn, Co, Fe, Ni, Cu) into B-sites of chromites on the \n\nelectronic transport is controversial, while the approaches to describe the electronic state of transition metal \n\ncations are significantly different. Basically, available data on the total conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, \n\noxygen nonstoichiometry, XPS studies suggest that the electronic transfer either dominates by hole migration \n\nover B-O-B network (where B is the transition metal dopant) with preservation of the stable state Cr3+ [113, \n\n167, 189, 191] or involves participation of chromium species in the redox equilibrium [10, 17, 164-166, 170, \n\n189, 206, 207]. In particular, slight doping LaCrO3-? and (La,Sr)CrO3-? with Mn/Co sharply decreases the \n\nconductivity in air and enhances the corresponding activation energy [164-166, 170]. This behavior assumes \n\nthat the hole transfer in moderately doped chromites proceeds over Cr atoms while isolated Mn3+/Co2+ \n\ncations act as hole traps. At higher Mn or Co content (~30% for La(Cr,Mn)O3-?) Mn-O-Mn paths become \n\npercolating which increases the conductivity and diminishes the corresponding activation energy. The \n\nequilibrium between Cr4+/Cr3+ and Mn4+/Mn3+/Mn2+ species was considered to analyze the temperature and \n\np(O2) dependence of the conductivity and Seebeck coefficient of (Ln,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-? [10]. In \n\n(Ce,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-?, Cr atoms are regarded as only hole traps, without significant contribution into the \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\nelectronic transport [207]. Whatever the transport mechanism, the conductivity values in air exceed 10 - 20 \n\nS/cm at 973 K for (Ln,A)(Cr,Mn)O3-? with Mn content  above 40 - 50% and for (Ln,A)(Cr,Co)O3-? with Co \n\ncontent higher than 10% [8, 10, 164-166, 170] (Fig. 1.2.3). Introduction of Ni or Fe into LaCrO3-? or \n\n(La,A)CrO3-? monotonously increases the conductivity in air and decreases the activation energy [131, 183], \n\nalthough the stability of Ni-rich chromites is arguable [131] and the corresponding data were obtained in O2 \n\n[183]. Cu-doping within the solubility limit also increases the conductivity in air [131, 134]. \n\nIn view of potential anode applications, much attention is focused on low-p(O2) conductivity, since \n\nthe electrocatalytic properties are generally governed by the transport characteristics. The conduction at \n\nreduced p(O2) is determined by both the conductivity in air and the reducibility of the composition and \n\nresultant drop of the amount of charge carriers; selected examples are shown in Figs. 1.2.4, 1.2.5 and Table \n\n1.2.1. Obviously, in order to achieve a reasonable low-p(O2) conductivity, one should find the optimum \n\ncontent for each dopant to ensure the high concentration of the charge carriers and moderate reducibility of \n\nthe perovskite. Because of differences in the preparation conditions of the materials, measuring procedure, \n\nuncertainties in the literature data, we will give only a brief overview of basic trends observed on reduced \n\nchromites, and discuss their applicability as anodes in terms of the electronic transport. \n\n \n\n-20 -15 -10 -5 0\n\nlog p(O2) (atm)\n\n-0.2\n\n0.4\n\n1.0\n\n1.6\n\n2.2\n\nlo\ng \n\n?\n (\n\nS\n/c\n\nm\n)\n\n1173 K\nLa0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-?

This region is followed by the conductivity drop \n\ncharacterized by the proportionality between the conductivity and p(O2)\n1/4. The slope may be reduced for \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\ntransition metal-doped chromites (Figs. 1.2.4 - 1.2.5) in the case of electron exchange between the \n\ncorresponding redox couples [8, 113, 184, 209]. The onset of the drop is determined by the nature and \n\namount of dopants and temperature. \n\nThe maximum low-p(O2) conductivity of (La,Ca)CrO3-? and (La,Sr)CrO3-? is observed for ~20 \n\nmol.% of the acceptor (Table 1.2.1) [112], although the exact knowledge of p(O2) is required for more \n\naccurate conclusions. For slightly doped (La,A)CrO3-?, the conductivity of Ca-containing chromites is \n\nsomewhat higher, while doping above 10% results in higher conduction of (La,Sr)CrO3-? [112, 143]. The \n\nconductivity of Ba-substituted LaCrO3-? is substantially lower; taking into account the poor stability [143], \n\nthis material is inappropriate for anode utilization. \n\nMg-doping negatively influences the low-p(O2) transport properties due to a substantial conductivity \n\ndrop originating from extensive oxygen losses [112]. On the other hand, introduction of bivalent Mg atoms \n\nmay improve the oxygen ionic conduction and suppress the chemical expansion. Introduction of small \n\namounts of Ni, Co, Fe, Mn or noble metals is considered to be a promising way to improve the \n\nelectrocatalytic activity, since the conductivity remains on the level 1 - 10 S/cm at partial oxygen pressure of \n\n10-20 - 10-15 atm (as shown in Table 1.2.1), while formation of small quantities of metallic or oxide phases \n\nshould not be detrimental for the electron transport characteristics (Table 1.1.1). High amounts of the dopants \n\nresult in a degradation of the conductivity with time, possibly associated with phase instability [17, 210]. \n\nThe donor dopants decrease the high-p(O2) conductivity and may annihilate the positive effect \n\ninduced by the presence of acceptor cations [155, 157, 159, 215]. At the same time, the introduction of \n\ndonors may improve the low p(O2) transport. For example, the conductivity of (La1-xCax)yCr1-zTizO3-? is \n\nsignificantly influenced by Ca:Ti ratio. Unless affected by kinetic factors, the conductivity basically exhibits \n\na p-n transition: in the high p(O2) region Ti is essentially in +4 state while the electron transport proceeds via \n\nhole hopping over Cr3+ and Cr4+ species. On further reduction, the formation of Ti3+ starts contributing while \n\nCr is essentially in +3 state; this combination provides the n-type transport behavior, although the existence \n\nof equilibrium amounts of Ti3+ and Cr4+ in the high- and low-p(O2) range, respectively, should also be \n\naccounted for more accurate analysis of the conductivity mechanism. Increasing La or Ti content or lowering \n\nthe A-site deficiency results in shifting the p-n transition to more oxidative region. However, these trends \n\nmay be obscured by the slow equilibration kinetics, especially typical for Ti-rich perovskites. The n-type \n\nconductivity, typical for ferrites, was also observed on Fe-doped chromites with large quantities of Fe at low \n\np(O2), when the contribution of Fe\n3+/Fe2+ couple is realized (Fig. 1.2.5). Depending on the composition and \n\nexperimental conditions, the conductivity of (La,A)(Cr,Fe)O3-? may achieve 5 - 10 S/cm at low p(O2) [212].  \n\n \n\n1.2.4. Thermal and chemical expansion \n\n \nThe data of the thermal expansion of chromites are contradictory; this primarily relates to undoped \n\nLnCrO3-? perovskites (Table 1.2.2) since their functional properties are strongly affected by the preparation \n\ntechnique, measurement procedure, purity of the material and other factors. Basically, in LnCrO3-? series the \n\nthermal expansivity behavior is consistent with Ln radii [131, 185, 203] showing the maximum thermal \n\nexpansion coefficients (TEC) for LaCrO3-?. \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\nTable 1.2.2.

Although the \n\nexpansion behavior of undoped LnCrO3-? is expected to be p(O2)-independent [112] due to negligible oxygen \n\nlosses, the thermomechanical properties may be affected by other factors influenced by p(O2), such as the \n\npresence of minor amounts of transition metals, temperature- or p(O2)-induced phase transitions, Cr \n\nvolatilization in oxidative or H2O-rich atmospheres, formation of Cr\n6+ species in oxidizing conditions, etc. \n\nIntroduction of alkali-earth cations into A-sublattice increases TECs, as shown in Table 1.2.2. Since \n\nthe radius of Ca ions is close to that of La, the higher expansion may be related with the phase transition or \n\nmore extensive oxygen losses [131, 225]. The effect of facilitated formation of oxygen vacancies on thermal \n\nexpansion is consistent with the correlation observed between the TEC and oxygen nonstoichiometry [131, \n\n194, 226]. The same factors should also contribute to the expansion of Sr- and Ba-doped chromites; in \n\ncombination with their larger ionic radii and shifting the phase transition to lower temperature, the TEC \n\nvalues are higher compared with Ca-doped analogues. The expansivity is partially suppressed by increasing \n\nfraction of relatively small Cr4+ ions with alkali-earth dopant content; this is supported by a decrease of the \n\ncell parameters of A-site doped chromites at room-temperature on doping [112, 143, 153]. \n\nMg introduction into B-sublattice of LaCrO3-? increases the thermal expansion, consistently with \n\nlarger ionic radius of Mg2+ in comparison with Cr3+ and Cr4+ [112]. The TECs of chromites doped with \n\nalkali-earth cations are in the range (8.0 - 12.0)\u00d710-6 K-1, which is close to those of commonly used solid \n\nelectrolytes [72, 227, 228]. Introduction of transition metal cations into B-cites of perovskite lattice of \n\nchromites basically results in an enhanced thermal expansion (Table 1.2.2); this may be attributed to larger \n\nionic radii of the guest ions, structural transitions, easier reducibility of the corresponding cations or that of \n\nCr4+ [8, 153, 179, 229]. The expansion behavior may also be influenced by electron exchange between the \n\ntransition metal cations [10, 207], variations of the spin state of cations [153] or other factors. Whatever the \n\neffect, the TECs remain moderate on doping with Al, Ti, Mn. Limited solubility of Ni, Cu, Zn in chromites \n\n[131, 181] also enables to keep the expansion below the critical level. Introduction of large amounts of easily \n\nreducible Fe and Co atoms in combination with A-site acceptor doping may increase TECs above 20\u00d710-6 K-1 \n\n[131, 179, 213] which is inappropriate for fuel cell applications. \n\nSimilar to other perovskite groups containing transition metal cations, chromites generally exhibit \n\nan expansion on reduction. The isothermal expansion behavior of chromites was studied by numerous \n\nauthors; the volume changes were attributed to increasing coulombic repulsion between charged cations close \n\nto a vacancy [194, 233], variation of the radius of transition metal ions [194, 196, 234-236], phase transitions \n\n[8, 236], microstructural phenomena or segregation/dissolution of impurities [169, 233, 235]. \n\nIn subsequent equations, the value of absolute oxygen deficiency ? will be used instead of more \n\ncorrect ?? which characterizes relative changes of the oxygen content. This simplification is based on \n\nobservations that chromites are nearly stoichiometric under high-p(O2) conditions [190, 197]. As observed in \n\nnumerous studies, the chemical expansion ?ch exhibits nearly linear dependence on the oxygen deficiency ?, \n\nwith the proportionality factor k represented by averaged linear expansion coefficient: \n\n \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\n0\nch\n\nL\nk\n\nL\n? ?\n\n?\n= =\n\n   (Eq. 1.2.6) \n\n \n\nIn the model proposed in [234], following assumptions were suggested: 1. mobile holes are located \n\non transition metal cations; 2. a closely packed lattice of oxides is formed by ions with rigid spheres; 3. the \n\nexpansion is isotropic in each of 3 directions. According to this approach, the generalized equation for the \n\nexpansion is as follows \n\n \n\n( )0\n\n0\n\ni i i i\n\ni\n\nch\n\ni\n\ni\n\nc r c r\n\nc r\n?\n\n?\n\n=\n?\n\n?\n\n  (Eq. 1.2.7) \n\n \n\nwhere ci and ri are the concentration and ionic radii, correspondingly, of i\nth ion of ABO3-? perovskite. The \n\nsubscript 0 relates to the reference state (which generally corresponds to the stoichiometric compound for \n\nchromites) at given temperature. \n\nIn accordance with [196, 234], the value ?ch/? should be essentially independent on temperature and \n\nalkali-earth dopant nature and amount. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1.2.6, the expansion behavior vs. ? is \n\ntemperature-independent within the experimental errors. However, comparison of (La,Sr)CrO3-? and \n\n(La,Ca)CrO3-? shows that the strains are slightly larger for Ca-substituted chromites and enhance with dopant \n\nlevel. In framework of the model in [234], the effect of dopant nature may be attributed to larger Sr radius \n\ncompared with Ca, while higher dopant amount yields more Cr4+ species in stoichiometric perovskites. Both \n\nfactors decrease the denominator in Eq. (1.2.7) for higher dopant content and for Sr-substituted chromites. \n\n \n\n0.04\n\n0.12\n\n0.20\n\n0.28\n\n0.36\n\n0.01 0.03 0.05 0.07\n\n0.03\n\n0.09\n\n0.15\n\n0.21\n\n0.00 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08\n\n?\n\n0.03\n\n0.09\n\n0.15\n\n0.21\n\n?\n =\n\n ?\nL\n\n/L\na\n\nir\n, \n\n%\n\nLa0.8Ca0.2CrO3-?\n1273 K [193]\n1173 K [190, 235]\n1073 K [190, 235]\n\nLa0.8Sr0.2Cr0.97V0.03O3-?\n1273 K [193]\n1073 K [196]\n\nLa0.8Sr0.2CrO3-?\n1273 K [194]\n1173 K [196]\n1073 K [196]\n\nLa0.95Ca0.05Cr0.84Al0.16O3-?

Isothermal dependencies of relative elongation of chromite-based ceramics vs. p(O2) \n\n \n\nRegardless of the effects indicated, the difference between the value ?ch/? for the examples above is \n\nnot substantial, and the expansion behavior should generally correlate with that of oxygen nonstoichiometry \n\nvariations. As shown in Figs. 1.2.6 - 1.2.7, the expansion is promoted by higher acceptor content and \n\nelevated temperature. LaCrO3-?-based materials exhibit larger expansivity compared with other LnCrO3-? \n\ncounterparts [160, 193, 233]. An exception was observed on Ce-doped chromites, where reduction of Cr4+ is \n\nsuppressed by formation of Ce3+. As the influence of changes in A-site cation radii on the expansion is \n\nsmaller, the presence of Ce4+/Ce3+ couple is suggested to have a buffering effect on the expansivity [203]. \n\nAs follows from Eq. (1.2.7), the value ?ch/? decreases on introduction of Mg or other acceptor-type \n\ndopants into B-sublattice. The effect of B-site doping into chromites on the expansion behavior is more \n\nsubstantial compared with substitutions in A-sublattice, as shown in Figs. 1.2.6 - 1.2.7. Al, Ga-doping into \n\nchromites shifts the onset of the expansion towards oxidative conditions, consistently with facilitated oxygen \n\nlosses [152, 235]  (Fig. 1.2.7). \n\nThe effect of doping with cations with strong reducibility is less obvious. Basically, the preference \n\nof a dopant to lower oxidation state is expected to provide larger oxygen losses and expansivity, as was \n\nobserved for Mn-, Co-, Ni-, Cu-doped chromites. On the other hand, Fe-doped chromites exhibit surprisingly \n\nlower chemically-induced strains decreasing with Fe content. Apart from possible experimental errors, the \n\neffects of the electron exchange between the cations, charge disproportionation, ordering phenomena, phase \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\ntransformations or spin state transitions on reduction [8, 10, 207, 237, 238] could also be responsible for the \n\nbehaviour observed. One should also account for possible formation or dissolution of secondary phases and \n\nmicrostructural factors, which result in slow equilibration or mechanical failure [163, 169]. Whatever the \n\nexpansion-determining factors, introduction of reducible cations into chromites suppresses the expansivity of \n\n(La,A)CrO3-?. On the other hand, doping with B-site cations shifts the onset of the length changes towards \n\noxidative conditions (Fig 1.2.7). \n\nThe data on the expansion of chromites indicate that this group of perovskite materials possesses a \n\nmoderate level of the thermally- and chemically-induced strains, in comparison with conventional Ni-YSZ \n\nanodes [239-241]. The parameter ?chem/? in chromites is basically lower compared with fluorites [237] which \n\nensures their lower sensitivity to nonstoichiometry variations caused by p(O2) changes or polarization, in \n\ncomparison with, for example, CeO2-based cermet anodes. Taking tensile modulus of chromites as 150-200 \n\nGPa and Poisson ratio as 0.3 [242], an expansion of 0.25 - 0.3% in isothermal conditions will cause the \n\nstresses 500 - 800 MPa, increasing on reduction [194]. Obviously, application of chromite-based anodes \n\nensures their better chemical and thermomechanical compatibility with chromite interconnects. \n\n \n\n1.2.5. Oxygen diffusivity \n\n \n\nThe process of the oxygen ionic transfer in perovskites ABO3-? is governed by the passage of an \n\noxygen anion through a bottleneck formed by a triangle A-B-A with A and B atoms located in the \n\nneighboring positions ([243] and references cited). The diffusion coefficient of oxygen atoms \nO\n\nD  may be \n\nschematically expressed as \n\n \n\n2\nO OV\n\nf m aH H H\n\nR TD a e\n\n? +? +?\n?\n\n?? ? ? ?? ?\nii\n\n?\n  (Eq. 1.2.8) \n\n \n\nwhere a stands for pseudocubic cell parameter and the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient is \n\ndetermined by thermal effect of the formation of oxygen vacancies (?Hf), their migration (?Hm) and \n\nassociation (?Ha). Generally, the vacancy formation term dominates among the enthalpies, since this value \n\ninvolves breaking of B-O bonds and lowering the coordination of B-cation. The energy required for the \n\nbreaking of B-O bond decreases in the sequence Ti>Cr>Mn>Cu>Fe>Co [17, 146, 244]. The migration \n\nenthalpy of oxide ions is essentially governed by their facility to pass through the triangle A-B-A and is \n\ninfluenced by the nature (electronic structure, dimension etc.) of large A-site cations and lattice distortions; \n\nthe minimum energy required to penetrate through the triangle is expected for cubic perovskites. The defect \n\nassociation-related phenomena are basically observed at high oxygen deficiency; examples include vacancy \n\nordering, coulombic interaction between the defects, etc. [243, 245, 246]. \n\nOxygen ionic transport in chromites is slow due to small oxygen vacancy concentration and the \n\nstrong preferability of Cr atoms to octahedral environment with oxygen atoms [46, 149], while the presence \n\nof Co, Mn, Ga and other cations with a flexible coordination number in B-sublattice promotes the formation \n\nand transfer of oxygen vacancies [247-249]. \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\nTable 1.2.3.

The \n\nactivation energies of the chemical diffusion or ionic conductivity in (Ln,A)CrO3-? are assessed as 100 - 160 \n\nkJ/mol decreasing on B-site doping with Fe or Ni [198, 251, 252]. The diffusivity of oxygen vacancies in \n\nchromites is, however, assessed to be comparable to that in cobaltites and ferrites [251] which indicates that \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\nthe difference in the ionic conduction is primarily associated with much smaller oxygen deficiency and its \n\nlow sensitivity towards variations in oxygen chemical potential. \n\nOn the other hand, small oxygen deficiency in chromites allows to avoid the ordering phenomena \n\ntypical for ferrites and cobaltites [114, 245, 246, 251]. Even Cr content as low as y = 0.1 in La0.33Sr0.67Fe1-\n\nyCryO3-? make it possible to prevent the ordering of oxygen vacancies due to random distribution of Cr atoms \n\nin B-sublattice and suppressed formation of FeO4 tetrahedra [179]. Increasing concentration of oxygen \n\nvacancies via acceptor doping or by reducing p(O2) ensures a higher level of the ionic transport in chromites, \n\nas shown in Tables 1.2.3 - 1.2.4. This behavior is in accordance with a general observation that the ionic \n\ntransport correlates with the expansion behaviour of perovskites [226, 253]. However, the increased oxygen \n\ndiffusivity should be compromised by worse stability, enhanced expansion and lower electronic conductivity \n\nin reducing atmospheres. \n\n \n\nTable 1.2.4.

This factor, in particular, \n\nmight induce an increase of the ionic conductivity proportionally to p(O2)\n1/2 in high-p(O2) range [192, 198]. \n\nThe surface exchange rates over chromites basically correlate with the ionic diffusion, assuming a \n\nmajor role of oxygen vacancies in the surface kinetics [252, 255]. However, the results are strongly \n\nsusceptible to material processing and experimental conditions, while slow equilibration results in a strong \n\nscattering of the data. As observed in Table 1.2.4, the exchange coefficients exhibit lower activation energies \n\ncompared with the diffusion coefficients and are less sensitive to p(O2) variations or acceptor doping. This \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\nindicates that the role of the surface-related limitations is expected to be more pronounced at lower \n\ntemperatures [252, 256], more reducing conditions [192] or higher content of dopants in A or B-sublattice \n\n[173, 252]. Irrespective of the trends observed, the low level of the ionic conductivity and slow surface \n\nexchange for LaCrO3-?-based materials does not allow to expect any substantial contribution of the bulk \n\nphase of the anode to the electrochemical process. This necessitates an optimization of the electrode \n\nmorphology or addition of ion-conductive components into the anode. \n\n \n\n1.2.6. Electrode performance \n\n \n\nThe electrochemical activity of chromite anodes strongly depends on the processing conditions, \n\nwhile comparison of experimental data is complicated by the lack of information on such important details as \n\nthe composition of the solid electrolyte, fuel gas atmosphere, fractions of the components in composite \n\nelectrode, etc. In most studies the perovskite anodes are covered with a layer of dispersed metallic particles \n\nsputtered or coated in form of paste, inks, etc. Althouth these particles are suggested to serve only as an \n\nelectron-conductive component, without any effect on the activity, the contribution of metal-containing \n\ncomponents can be neglected only when no surface spreading or metal penetration into the electrochemically \n\nactive zone occurs. As shown by previous studies [261-263], Pt, Ag, Au and other noble metals possess non-\n\nnegligible catalytic activity which may be significantly higher compared to that of chromites. A wide \n\nutilization of noble metals in industrial scales is limited by high costs, while conventional current collectors \n\nmade of stainless steels or LaCrO3-?-based ceramics have significantly higher bulk and contact resistance.  \n\nPure or A-site doped LaCrO3-? basically possess extremely low electrochemical activity (Table \n\n1.2.5); for instance, the polarization resistance of La0.7Cr0.32CrO3-? anode is reported to be ~86 Ohm\u00d7cm\n2 at \n\n1123 K [201]. Therefore, chromites basically serve as chemically and mechanically stable electron \n\nconductive matrix in combination with ionic conductors (CeO2-, ZrO2-based oxides) or catalytically-active \n\ncomponents (Ni, Pd, VOx). A large fraction of the stable perovskite phase diminishes risks of microstructural \n\nchanges occurring on the additional components. Obviously, compared with conventional Ni-YSZ anodes, \n\nchromites are less susceptible to contamination with Cr species originating from the contact with interconnect \n\nmaterials. The activity can be to some extent improved by introducing A- or B-site dopants, especially those \n\nwhich form catalytically-active centres on the perovskite surface (Mn, Fe, etc.) or dispersed metallic particles \n\n(Ni, Ru). Extensive doping may induce a destabilization of the perovskite phase and enhance the chemical \n\nexpansion [17, 146, 264, 265]. \n\nThe electronic conductivity is one of critical factors determining the activity of perovskite-based \n\nanodes for hydrogen or hydrocarbon oxidation [10, 14, 265, 266]. As shown in Table 1.2.1, the conductivity \n\nis significantly reduced under anode conditions below 1 - 5 S/cm. Accounting for the porous microstructure \n\nof the electrode layer, the role of the current collector and addition of metallic or other electron conductive \n\nphases in most cases becomes more substantial than the intrinsic properties of the perovskite phase. On the \n\nother hand, appropriate A- or B-site doping may modify the transport and electrochemical properties. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\nTable 1.2.5.

Detailed description of the corresponding anodes and relationships between their \n\nfunctional properties and electrochemical performance will be presented in a separate section. One should \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\nnote that basically increasing the electronic transport in (Ln,A)(Cr,Mn)O3-? perovskite results in higher \n\ncatalytic or electrocatalytic activity, emphasizing the role of the electronic conduction. Similar observations \n\nwere made for (La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-?-based perovskite anodes. The performance generally increases with Fe \n\ncontent, possibly due to better electronic conductivity and improved ionic transport. The polarization \n\nresistances for (Ln,A)(Cr,Mn)O3-? and (Ln,A)(Cr,Fe)O3-? are comparable, although the results in various \n\nstudies are contradictory [9, 212]. \n\nDissolution of Ni or Ru cations in the perovskite phase with their subsequent segregation on \n\nreduction allows to produce submicron dispersed metallic particles which possess a high catalytic activity. \n\nOne of benefits of such an approach relates to partial or complete dissolution of the metals on oxidation [15, \n\n201] which improves the stability of the anodes on redox cycling. The precipitation of the metallic phases \n\nfrom the perovskite structure provides better electrochemical performance than preparation of mechanical \n\nmixtures with similar fraction of perovskite and metal [15]. In terms of microstructural stability, Ru-doping is \n\nmore preferable compared with Ni due to higher melting point of Ru and, as a result, its suppressed \n\nvaporization and sintering [188, 267]. In La1-xSrxCr1-yRuyO3-?, the compromise between the optimum \n\nelectrochemical activity and stability was achieved for x = 0.3 and y = 0.08 [15]; this composition is close to \n\nLa0.7Sr0.3Cr0.95Ni0.05O3-? which exhibited the maximum CH4 conversion compared with other \n\n(La,Sr)(Cr,Ni)O3-? catalysts [265]. \n\nApart from the electrochemical activity of chomite electrodes, one should take into account their \n\ncompatibility with solid electrolytes. As the reactivity of electrode materials is governed by their stability, the \n\nchemical compatibility of chromites with commonly used solid electrolytes is generally better than that of \n\ncobaltites, ferrites and manganites. Interaction of Ca- or Sr-doped LaCrO3-? with solid electrolytes is strongly \n\nassociated with cation demixing and formation of Ca-Cr-O or Sr-Cr-O secondary phases [141]. (La,Sr)CrO3-? \n\nare basically more compatible with YSZ electrolytes [134, 138, 275]. Reactivity of Ca-doped LaCrO3-? with \n\nYSZ originates from formation of CaO, Cam(CrO4)n phases [143], which are in most cases segregated at high \n\ntemperatures during synthesis of the chromite perovskites, or from high diffusivity and solubility of Ca in the \n\nfluorite structure [154, 276]. Obviously, A-site deficiency suppresses the formation of Ln2Zr2O7-?, SrZrO3-? or \n\nCaZrO3-? phases [134]. The cation demixing may be promoted by exposure of the electrode to hydrocarbon- \n\nor CO/CO2-containing atmospheres or by polarization ([44, 259] and references cited). \n\nThe presence of Sr2VO4 and Sr2CrO4 impurities in (La,Sr)(Cr,V)O3-? enhances the reactivity of the \n\nanode with YSZ at temperatures as low as 1273 K in both oxidizing and reducing atmospheres, which is \n\ninappropriate for SOFC applications [231]. The chemical compatibility of (La,Ca)(Cr,Ti)O3-? [155], \n\nLa0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? [8, 277], Pr0.7Ca0.3(Cr,Mn)O3-? [210] and (La,Sr)(Cr,Ru)O3-? [186] with YSZ \n\nelectrolytes was observed at least up to 1573, 1573, 1473 and 1373 K. \n\nThe interaction with LaGaO3-?-based electrolytes is primarily associated with a high tolerance of \n\ngallate phases towards B-site substitution and a gradient of La chemical potential between the components \n\ninducing La diffusion and formation of interfacial LaSrGaO4 and LaSrGa3O7 phases with low ionic \n\nconductivity [278-280]. With respect to anode materials, the presence of Fe, Ni, Co-containing compositions \n\nin direct contact with LSGM is undesirable [9, 10, 278]. For example, the onset of interaction between \n\n(La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-? and LSGM is located at relatively low temperatures (1073 - 1173 K) resulting in cation \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\nexchange [278] or formation of LaSrGa3O7 [264]. The interaction of La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Al0.5O3-? with LSGM \n\nstarts at 1473 K producing SrCrO4, LaCrO3-? and LaGaO3-?-based phases and causing the electrode \n\ndelamination [9]. La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? reacts with LSGM at temperatures as high as 1623 - 1673 K with \n\nformation of LaSrGaO4 and LaSrGa3O7 [279, 280]. Similar to LSGM, the compatibility of CeO2-?-based \n\nelectrolytes is determined by solubility and mobility of cations in the fluorite structure. La0.7Ca0.3CrO3-? was \n\nreported to be compatible with CGO [268] at 1473 K. No chemical interaction between (La,Sr)CrO3-? and \n\nCGO was reported up to 1873 K, however, the presence of CaCrO4, SrCrO4 or Cr2O3 impurities causes a \n\nstrong cation interdiffusion and formation of new phases [281]. No interaction of Ce0.9Sr0.1Cr0.5Fe0.5O3-? with \n\nCe0.8Sm0.2O2-? was found at 1173 K in N2 [223]. \n\nApart from the interaction with electrolyte material, the long-term performance of chromite-based \n\nanodes is strongly affected by the presence of components with low chemical and/or microstructural stability \n\n(metallic phase, VOx, doped CeO2-?, etc.) which may undergo a loss of catalytic activity, vaporization, \n\nchanges in porous anode microstructure due to sintering and lowering the active electrode surface area, \n\nblocking the pores, strong volume changes, cracking of the electrode layer or its delamination from the \n\nelectrolyte. As an example, stable operation was found in H2 and CH4 for La0.7Sr0.3Cr0.95Ru0.05O3-? - YSZ \n\n[186], while increasing Ru fraction results in a coalescence of the metallic particle and reduces the activity \n\n[15, 188]. While the performance of Ce0.9Sr0.1Cr0.5V0.5O3-? anode was stable in H2S - CH4 for more than 15 \n\nhours at 1123 K, the composite Ce0.9Sr0.1Cr0.5V0.5O3-? - YSZ - Ni showed a degradation rate of 10% per 15 \n\nhours at the same conditions [162]. Comparable degradation rate was detected for La0.8Sr0.2Cr0.98V0.02O3-? - \n\nCGO - Ni (48 - 48 - 4 wt. %) in hydrocarbon atmosphere at 873 - 1023 K [274], while no drop of the \n\nperformance was observed for anode La0.8Sr0.2Cr0.97V0.03O3-? - CGO (75 - 25 wt.%) impregnated with Ru (1 \n\nmg/cm2) in wet CH4 [282]. This observation confirms that the stability is mainly governed by the nature and \n\namount of metallic or other microstructurally-unstable phases rather than by the perovskite degradation. B-\n\nsite doping of chromites with transition metals may also promote the degradation processes; in particular, the \n\ninitial high performance of Mn-, Fe-, Ni- and Ru-doped chromite anodes is in most cases followed by a rapid \n\ndecay [186, 212, 283].   \n\nOther factors which influence the stable operation of chromite electrodes are thermal or redox \n\ncycling; the latter may be induced by changing the gas environment or by oscillating polarization. As the \n\nelementary electrode steps are affected by p(O2) by various manner, the final result is not obvious. For \n\nexample, the polarization resistance of La0.8Sr0.2Cr0.97V0.03O3-? anode decreased after reoxidation in air [201], \n\nwhile La0.8Sr0.2Cr0.98V0.02O3-? - CGO - Ni showed a drop of activity on oxidation in air, followed by a rapid \n\nrecovery after switching back to H2 or C3H8. This composite anode could withstand up to 11 redox cycles of \n\n1 hour [274]. In [283], the performance of La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? - YSZ composite anode was deteriorated \n\non cycling in wet H2 - reformate - wet O2 at 1173 K by 15% per 4 cycles; however, the initial performance \n\ndrop was followed by subsequent stabilization. The performance of La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? - CGO (33 - 67 \n\nwt. %) showed a slight (3%) decrease after cycling in wet CH4 at 1123 K for 50 hours under currents \n\noscillating in the range 200 - 400 mA/cm2 [284]. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\n1.2.7. Cr-poisoning phenomena in SOFCs \n\n \n\nThis section is devoted to the phenomena of contamination of SOFC components with Cr species. \n\nThe poisoning is mainly associated with application of Cr-containing interconnect materials. The primary \n\nfunction of interconnects is to ensure mechanical and electrical contact between the cathode/anode of \n\nadjacent cells and to provide the separation of the fuel gas from the oxidant. This imposes stringent \n\nrequirements on the interconnect material such as chemical stability towards oxidative and reductive \n\natmospheres, impremeability of gases, high electronic and negligible ionic conduction, chemical and \n\nmechanical compatibility with SOFC components, low costs [3, 6]. \n\nCurrently, 2 types of interconnect materials are employed. One group is represented by metallic \n\nalloys, mainly Fe-based materials due to their low costs and relatively high tolerance towards oxidation due \n\nto formation of Cr2O3-based scales on the surface. The oxidation resistance as well as mechanical properties \n\nmay be tuned by addition of Al, Cr, Si, Mo and other elements. The percentage of Cr in metal-based \n\ninterconnect materials is basically higher than 10 wt.%, although this amount should not overcome 26 wt.% \n\nto avoid formation of brittle phases [285]. \n\nCeramics with acceptable electronic conductivity compose the other group of interconnect materials. \n\nAs shown in previous sections, the characteristics of LnCrO3-?-based materials satisfy the most requirements; \n\nin particular, the negligible ionic conductivity of chromites is more advantageous for interconnects rather \n\nthan for anodes. However, poor thermal conductivity, possibility of cracking and insufficient density restricts \n\nthe application of chromites as interconnects. Generally, the choice of interconnect material is determined by \n\nthe range of working and fabrication temperatures. While metal-based interconnects suffer from oxidation at \n\nhigh temperatures, chromite-based ceramic materials are stable in a wide p(O2) range ([46, 134] and \n\nreferences therein). On the other hand, the conductivity of chromites is substantially activated by temperature \n\n[112, 160, 187]; consequently, this group of interconnects is mainly considered for high-temperature \n\nutilization. Decreasing the temperature reduces the risk of oxidation of metallic interconnects which makes \n\nthese more appropriate for intermediate- and low-temperature electrochemical cells. \n\nIrrespective of the type of the interconnect, most materials contain substantial amount of Cr which \n\ncan cause contamination of other SOFC components and subsequent degradation of the performance. Even if \n\nCr content in interconnect is moderate and its reactivity is suppressed by binding to a stable composition or \n\napplication of protective layers, Cr penetration into electrode compartments may proceed via flowing in gas \n\nphase from upstream cell components like manifolds, heat exchangers, etc. \n\nAs reported above, for Cr-containing alloys, protective Cr2O3-based scales are formed on the \n\nsurface. The formation was observed under both cathode and anode conditions, although in the latter case, \n\nthe growth rate was much lower. In numerous cells, the Cr2O3 layer is the most resistant component, while its \n\ncontinuous enlargement results in a progressive increase of Ohmic losses [286]. In contact of Cr2O3 with Co, \n\nFe, Mn, Ni-containing electrodes, the formation of spinel phases (Cr,M)3O4 was observed [241, 285, 287]. \n\nThese phases are more preferable in comparison with Cr2O3 in terms of conductivity, especially Co-rich ones \n\n[241], although the resistance is still too high for achieving reasonable power densities of the cell, while the \n\ndepletion of the electrode with a transition metal may reduce the catalytic activity. \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\nOne of the most detrimental phenomena in terms of the cell degradation is Cr penetration into the \n\nelectrode layers. In literature, two ways of Cr incorporation are discussed: surface diffusion and deposition \n\nfrom the gas phase. The diffusion was shown to be strongly promoted by the presence of Co-, Mg-, Mn-, Sr-, \n\nand Au-containing species [285, 288, 289]. Among cathode materials, the most susceptible ones to diffusion-\n\nrelated Cr contamination are manganite- and cobaltite-based compositions [285]. \n\nAnother mechanism Cr poisoning processes involves chromia vaporization and subsequent \n\ndeposition on the surface of cell components [82-85]. The latter process is especially pronounced at elevated \n\ntemperatures due to enhanced activation energy [285]. As shown in Figs. 1.2.8 - 1.2.9, the most abundant Cr-\n\ncontaining species in gas phase are CrO3, CrO2(OH)2 and CrO2(OH). Occasional penetration of water vapors \n\ninto the cathode compartment results in an enrichment of the atmosphere with Cr oxihydroxides. The \n\npresence of Cr-containing volatile species may subsequently result in their reduction and deposition on the \n\ncathode or electrolyte surface or at the interface cathode-electrolyte. \n\nThe deposition of Cr-containing compounds from the gas phase may be catalyzed electrochemically \n\n[85, 290], by reduction in oxygen-depleted atmosphere near the triple phase boundary (TPB) [83, 290] or \n\nchemically; in the latter case, the deposition is ensured by the presence of catalytically-active species (i.e. \n\nMn2+, Co2+ or SrO) [84, 285, 291]. The latter mechanism is confirmed by the fact that in manganite- and \n\ncobaltite-based cathodes, the deposition proceeds in the entire electrode layer. \n\nBasically, Cr is deposited in form of spinel phase; examples of the chemical reduction processes are \n\nshown in Eqs. (1.2.9) - (1.2.12): \n\n \n\n( ) ( ) ( )3 2 3 22CrO  = Cr O + 3 2 Og s g      (Eq. 1.2.9) \n\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )2 2 3 2 222CrO OH  = Cr O +2H O 3 2Og s g g+\n   (Eq. 1.2.10) \n\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\n( ) ( )\n\n1-x x 3-? 2 3 1-x x 1-y y 3-?' 1-y y 4/3-?\"\n\n2\n\nLa Sr MnO +1 2 Cr O  = La Sr Mn Cr O + Cr Mn O +\n\n+ 1 6+?'+?\"-? 2 O\n\ns s s s\n\ng\n\n (Eq. 1.2.11) \n\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\n\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\n1-x x 3-? 2 3 1-x x 1-y y 3-?'\n\n1-y y 4/3-?\" 2\n\nLa Sr MnO + ZrO2+ 1 - 2 Cr O  = La Sr Mn Zr O +\n\n+ Cr Mn O + 1 6 +?'+?\"-?+ 2 2 O\n\ns y y s s\n\ns y g\n\n  (Eq. 1.2.12) \n\n \nDeposition of Cr2O3 causes lowering the pressure of Cr-containing phases which favors subsequent \n\nvaporization of Cr from interconnect and resultant depletion with chromium. Accumulation of the spinel \n\nphase results in gradually increasing concentration polarization, while the volume changes may cause a \n\npropagation of cracks [83, 290]. \n\nThe electrochemically-assisted deposition process is supported by observations that cathodic \n\npolarization promotes the degradation, while the formation of spinel phase takes place predominantly near \n\ncathode-electrolyte interface [82, 83, 290].

Isothermal dependencies of partial pressure of \nselected Cr-containing gaseous species over solid Cr2O3 \nand chromites vs. p(H2O). The data are taken from [82]. \n\nFig. 1.2.9. Temperature dependencies of selected Cr-\ncontaining gaseous species over solid Cr2O3. The \ndata are taken from [82]. \n\n \n\nThe deposition of Cr2O3 and subsequent interaction with cathode and electrolyte materials (Eqs. \n\n(1.2.11), (1.2.12)) result in blocking TPB by the products, while the participation of electrons in the \n\nsecondary processes reduces the efficiency of the cell. Estimations carried out in [82] showed that under \n\nworking conditions, the deposition rate of chromia at the cathode exceeds 8\u00d710-9 g/m2\u00d7s, i.e., considering the \n\ntotal cathode surface, this value corresponds to formation of a Cr monolayer in 2.4 s. \n\nSimilar to the surface diffusion, the maximum Cr deposition from the gaseous phase was observed \n\non (La,Sr)MnO3-? and (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-?-based cathodes [285, 291, 292]. A strong tendency of Fe-\n\ncontaining cathodes, i.e La0.8Sr0.2Co0.75Fe0.25O3-?, LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-?, La0.8Sr0.2FeO3-? to degradation in contact \n\nwith Cr-containing materials was reported by Montero et al. [293], although in other publications, \n\nLa(Ni,Fe)O3-? compositions were found to be tolerant towards Cr contamination [285, 294]. At high content \n\nof alkali-earth cations in cathode material, the phases CaCrO4, SrCrO4 or BaCrO4 can be formed at the \n\ninterface cathode-interconnect or on the cathode surface [44, 293] with resultant deterioration of transport \n\nand mechanical properties or loss of the electrochemical activity. \n\nThe anode conditions are generally not favorable for Cr vaporization and a substantial enrichment of \n\nthe gas atmosphere with Cr species may be only as a result of an occasional penetration from other \n\ncompartments of the cell or by an accidental oxidation of Cr-containing anodes. Moreover, the \n\nelectrochemical oxidation at the anode side should suppress the processes Eqs. (1.2.13) - (1.2.15). Possibly, \n\none should take precautions with Cr chemical deposition on the anode surface, in particular when operating \n\nwith Mn-containing since the presence of Mn2+ or MnO species and low p(O2) may induce the reduction of \n\ngaseous Cr6+-containing species and their deposition. However, such phenomena have not been found in \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\nliterature. More concerns are related with Cr, Fe and Ni interdiffusion between the anode and interconnect \n\nmaterials resulting in formation of insulating Cr2O3, (Cr,Ni)3O4 and FeO phases [288, 293, 295, 296]. One \n\nshould notice that Cr2O3-based phases possess a worse conductivity under low-p(O2) conditions [115, 288] \n\nwhich may be caused by H2 dissolution in chromia [297]. Similar to cathode degradation process, the \n\nformation of the secondary phases may result in blocking pores in the top layers of the electrode, and risks of \n\nmechanical failure due to chemical expansion [296]. \n\nAmong solid electrolytes, gallate-based perovskites are strongly susceptible to deposition of \n\nchromia onto the surface from the vapour phase or to the surface diffusion in contact with an interconnect \n\n[285]. A slight bulk diffusion of Cr and Mn from (La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-?-based electrodes into LSGM was \n\nreported [10, 218]. The poisoning effect of Cr on fluorite-type electrolytes is less studied. A slight diffusion \n\nof Cr along the surface of YSZ and CGO was observed, without any traces of Cr2O3 precipitated from the gas \n\nphase [285], in contrast to the mechanism expressed by Eq. (1.2.12) [82]. The contamination of the \n\nelectrolytes is attributed to catalyzing effect of Y2O3 and Gd2O3 additions, while the parent phases ZrO2 and \n\nCeO2 are insusceptible towards Cr penetration [285]. \n\nIn order to prevent the problems associated with the contamination of SOFC components with Cr, \n\nseveral modifications were undertaken, with the primary focus on inhibition of volatilization of Cr-containing \n\ncompounds or suppressing the diffusion. In particular, the vaporization may be suppressed by utilization of \n\nceramic chromite-based interconnects. As shown in Fig. 1.2.8, the partial pressure of CrO3, CrO2(OH)2 and \n\nCrO2(OH) over chromite perovskites are 3 - 4 orders lower than over Cr2O3, although their behavior with \n\nchanges of p(H2O) or temperature is similar. A positive effect may be achieved by reducing the operation \n\ntemperature. One should note that most studies on Cr vaporization or diffusion phenomena from metallic \n\ninterconnects have been carried out at the temperatures above 973 K, while the Cr-containing alloys are \n\ndesigned for operation in the intermediate- or low-temperature ranges. \n\nIn LnCrO3-?-based interconnects, the vaporization of chromia during preparation or operation \n\nprocedure was shown to be suppressed by creation of Cr deficiency in the perovskite [135], appropriate \n\ndoping into A- or B-sublattice [153, 189, 209] or introduction of components ensuring better densification \n\n[160]. Thin layers of LaCrO3-?- or LaMnO3-?-based perovskites ([288, 290] and references cited), spinel-type \n\n(Mn,Co,Cr)3O4  [293, 296] or CeO2-based materials [296] were shown to prevent the interdiffusion between \n\nthe corresponding materials or to suppress chromia vaporization from the surface, although their application \n\nmay result in increasing Ohmic drops of the cell. \n\nFinally, one should notice that Cr is not the unique component which causes the cell degradation. \n\nFe-diffusion from interconnects is stronger than that of Cr, and may also cause the formation of insulating \n\nphases [288, 296]. Numerous interconnect alloys contain Mo-, Si- and other elements capable to generate \n\nvolatile compounds with more detrimental effect on the properties of SOFC components.  \n\n  \n\n1.3. Manganite-based perovskites and their limitations \n\n \n\nManganite-based perovskites have been widely studied as cathode materials due to their high \n\nelectronic conductivity, moderate thermal expansion, acceptable catalytic activity and suppressed (in \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\ncomparison with other cathodes) interaction with SOFC components. Reduction of manganites, although \n\nbeing attractive in terms of an improvement of the ionic transport and mofification of the electrochemical \n\nproperties, results in destabilization of the perovskite phase. On the other hand, the number of studies \n\ndevoted to assessment of manganites as anode materials or evaluation of their low-p(O2) characteristics has \n\nbeen growing in recent years. The present section is focused on comparison of manganite perovskite as \n\npotential anode materials, with a primary attention on their tolerance towards reducing atmospheres. \n\n \n\n1.3.1. Thermodynamic stability \n\n \n\nThe behavior of manganite perovskites in terms of the defect equilibrium is generally similar to that \n\nof chromite analogues, and most equations described in the corresponding section may be applied for \n\nLnMnO3\u00b1?-based compositions. However, manganite perovskites exhibits some peculiarities: \n\n1. High flexibility of Mn cations in terms of the oxygen coordination and the capability to adopt the \n\noxidation state +2 significantly increase the oxygen nonstoichiometry of manganites in comparison with \n\nchromite analogues. The stability of Mn in +2, +3 and +4 oxidation states makes it necessary to account for \n\nthe process of Mn3+ disproportionation in modeling the defect equilibrium. \n\n2. Manganites are capable to accommodate excessive oxygen in the crystal lattice. Since the \n\nperovskite structure is not tolerant to incorporation of oxygen into the interstitial sites, the overstoichiometry \n\nis accompanied by generation of cation vacancies [298-300]. Although at low p(O2) the cation vacancies \n\ndisappear, the processes associated with variations of oxygen content may be characterized by phase \n\ntransitions and dimensional changes which should be taken into account when fabricating the anode layers. \n\nDefect models explaining the behavior of manganite perovskites have been elaborated in numerous \n\nstudies [234, 244, 300-305]. In [303], a model which included the coexistence of 9 type of lattice defects in \n\nLa, Mn and O sublattices in p(O2) range of 10\n-30 - 10-5 atm was proposed using numerical methods of \n\ncalculation. Selected approaches involved consideration of the interactions between the defect species, \n\nformation of defect clusters, etc [224, 304, 305]. In the model elaborated by Mizusaki et al. [300] for Sr-\n\nsubstituted manganites, the energy levels of the states \nMn\n\nMn? , \nMn\n\nMn\n\u00d7 , \n\nMn\nMn\n\ni  are assumed to be close, and the \n\nthermodynamic parameters are governed essentially by the average Mn oxidation state. However, this \n\napproach is valid only in a limited range of Mn oxidation states, where the concentrations of Mn species may \n\nbe considered comparable. Moreover, the model does not describe adequately the experimental data. \n\nRegardless the approach describing the behavior of manganite perovskites, the stability of Mn in 2+ \n\nstate significantly enhances the maximum oxygen deficiency in comparison with chromites. While La1-\n\nxAxCrO3-? shows the high- and low-p(O2) saturations at ? = 0 and x/2, for manganite-based analogues these \n\nregions are expected to transform into a plateau-like dependencies, followed by subsequent variations of \n\noxygen content [303]. The width of the low-p(O2) plateau is determined by the equilibrium constant of Mn\n3+ \n\ndisproportionation. In practice, no plateau-like behavior at ? = x/2 has been observed, as shown in Fig. 1.3.1. \n\nFor most compositions, this phenomenon is associated with low tolerance of the perovskite structure towards \n\nextensive oxygen losses, preventing formation of large quantities of Mn2+ species. \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\n \n\n-15 -10 -5 0\n\nlog p(O2) (atm)\n\n2.85\n\n2.90\n\n2.95\n\n3.00\n\n3.05\n\n3.10\n\n2.80\n\n2.85\n\n2.90\n\n2.95\n\n3.00\n\n-24 -18 -12 -6 0\n\n2.7\n\n2.8\n\n2.9\n\n3.0\n\n3.1\n\n3.2\n\n3-\n?\n\nLaMnO3-?

Isothermal dependencies of oxygen content in manganites vs. p(O2) \n\n \n\nApproximate phase boundaries of selected manganite-based perovskites are shown in Fig. 1.3.2 and \n\nTable 1.3.1. Consistently with the defect model, alkali earth dopants enlarge the oxygen losses and reduce the \n\nstability of manganites. Depending on the doping level, decomposition of (La,Sr)MnO3\u00b1? leads to formation \n\nof MnO, SrMnO3-? and (La,Sr)2MnO4\u00b1? phases, with La:Sr ratio similar or somewhat lower (for La-rich \n\ncompositions) than that in the parent perovskite [309, 310]. On increasing Sr content, an enrichment of the \n\nsurface with Sr was observed, promoted by low p(O2) [311-313]. The stability of LnMnO3\u00b1? decreases with \n\nlowering the radius of A-cation [45], as shown in Fig. 1.3.2. \n\nWhile replacement of chromium in LnCrO3\u00b1?-based perovskites promotes oxygen losses even when \n\nthe doping cations are stable towards reduction, the effect of B-site cation substitution in manganites is less \n\nobvious. Introduction of easily reducible Fe, Co, Ni, Cu enhances the oxygen losses and deteriorates the \n\nstability of the manganites towards reduction; selected examples of variations of the oxygen content in Co-\n\ndoped manganites are presented in Fig. 1.3.1. [226, 307, 308]. \n\nIntroduction of 3-fold charged cations, like Sc, has no obvious effect on the oxygen \n\nnonstoichiometry [306], although more results for B-site substituted manganites are required for more certain \n\nconclusions. Doping of PrMnO3\u00b1?-based compositions with In diminishes oxygen losses on reduction at 973 \n\nK compared with In-free analogue, while at 1273 K the trend is opposite [314]. This might indicate a strong \n\neffect of the substituents on the enthalpy of vacancy formation, kinetic factors or individual peculiarities of \n\ndoping cations with respect to oxygen environment. \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\n0.75 0.80 0.85 0.90 0.95 1.00\n\n103/T, K-1\n\n-24\n\n-20\n\n-16\n\n-12\n\n-8\n\nlo\ng \n\np(\nO\n\n2)\n (\n\nat\nm\n\n)\n\nLaMnO3-?

Stability limits of manganite perovskites \n \n \nIntroduction of 3+, 4+, 5+-charged cations generally results in thermodynamic or kinetic \n\nstabilization of manganites at low p(O2), as shown in Table 1.3.1. Single-phase LnMnO3\u00b1?-based perovskites \n\nwere detected at p(O2) as low as 10\n-20 atm at 973 - 1173 K, which is quite acceptable for the anode \n\napplications. One may observe contradictions between the results presented in Table 1.3.1. In particular, \n\nLa0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? is reported to decompose at 10\n-20 atm at 1173 K [191], although in [8] the stability \n\nof the perovskite phase was observed down to at least 10-21 atm. While Pr0.7Ca0.3Cr0.4Mn0.6O3-? was found to \n\nbe stable in dry 5% H2 - Ar [210], a similar composition doped with 25% of Sr and 50% of Mn showed \n\ninsufficient stability in more mild reducing atmospheres [8], although the lower content of the alkali earth \n\ncation and Mn are expected to improve the tolerance towards reduction. La0.8Sr0.2Mn0.8Sc0.2O3-? is stable at \n\n1123 K in H2 - Ar mixture with p(O2) = 10\n-21 atm and in wet CH4 (p(O2) = 10\n\n-23 atm) [315]. On the other \n\nhand, in CO - CO2 atmosphere with p(O2) = 10\n-18 atm at 1123 K the same material shows the formation of \n\nsecondary phases [316]. In the latter case, the presence of CO or CO2 might promote the decomposition of \n\nthe perovskite while poor conversion of CH4 over the perovskite might ensure insufficiently reductive \n\natmosphere, thus maintaining its stability. \n\nIn the high p(O2) range, manganites with moderate quantities of acceptor-type substituents exhibit a \n\nso-called oxygen overstoichiometry (LnMnO3+?), presumably due to preferability of formation of the \n\nvacancies in A- or B-sublattice is arguable. Small size of B-cations favors their incorporation into A-\n\nsublattice, which, on the other hand, is hindered by strong bonds B-O. In literature, the equivalent \n\nconcentration of A- and B-site vacancies as well as their dominant formation in one of the sublattices can be \n\nfound [298-300, 321, 322]; currently, most approaches consider the preferability of the formation of A-site \n\nvacancies [298-300]. The cation exchange between A and B-perovskite positions enlarges the range of \n\nacceptable Ln:Mn ratios; for LaMnO3\u00b1?, formation of single phase was observed for Mn/(La+Mn) of 0.45 - \n\n0.52 at 1123 K, the region expanding on cooling [302]. \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n\nTable 1.3.1.

[300] detected a tendency towards saturation of the oxygen overstoichiometry, close \n\nto 3+??3.2 for LaMnO3+? and decreasing with Sr content. The limit is especially pronounced at temperatures \n\nlower than 700 - 800 K and Sr-substituted manganites. The maximum amount of the cation vacancies is \n\nevaluated to be 1/9 which corresponds to LaMnO3.19 [300]. Alkali-earth doping results in a linear decrease of \n\nthe maximum oxygen content which the perovskite structure may accommodate; at doping level higher than \n\n~30%, the oxygen excess disappears. These results as well as the corresponding defect model should be \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \n\nconsidered with precautions due to hindered mobility of the cation vacancies, especially at lowered \n\ntemperatures, retarding the equilibration kinetics. This causes a wide scattering between the experimental \n\ndata; in particular, under p(O2) = 200 bar at low temperatures formation of LaMnO3.29 was reported [322]. \n\nIrrespective to the oxygen excess, the transport behavior of manganites is essentially unaffected by \n\np(O2) variations in oxidative atmospheres [301, 323]. According to [300, 323], an electron from a sublevel \n\nbelonging to an oxygen atom is suggested to hop into a t2g level of Mn and the hole remaining in the oxygen \n\nsublevel is excluded from the transfer mechanism. Another possibility is associated with the fact that the \n\ncharge transport proceeds along Mn-O-Mn paths and formation of cation vacancies in B-sublattice \n\ncompensates the increase in hole concentration [322]. \n\nIn terms of potential anode applications, consideration of the functional properties will be focused \n\nprimarily on the behavior at low p(O2). Therefore, the choice of the manganite perovskites will be limited by \n\nthe materials stable under reducing conditions. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.3.2. Mixed electronic-ionic conductivity in reducing atmospheres and thermomechanical \n\nproperties \n \n\nIn the present section, available data on the behavior of manganites under low oxygen pressures will \n\nbe overviewed, with a brief discussion of selected properties of the materials under atmospheric p(O2) and \n\ntheir behavior on reduction. More detailed characterization of Mn-rich perovskites under atmospheric \n\nconditions can be found elsewhere ([4, 131, 266, 323, 324] and references cited]). \n\nSimilar to LnCrO3-? perovskites, manganites are electronic conductors with a minor contribution of \n\nthe oxygen ionic transport. The conductivity behavior of manganites with a moderate (<50%) content of \n\nacceptor-type dopants in A-sublattice shows trends typical for p-type electronic conductors. According to the \n\ntransport model proposed by Mizusaki et al. [300, 323], the electron transfer is promoted by participation of a \n\nvacant eg sublevel in 3d-level of \nMn\n\nMn\ni . The conductivity of (La,Sr)MnO3\u00b1? in air increases with acceptor \n\ncontent, achieving the maximum for doping level of 20 - 50 mol.% [266, 323, 324]. As discussed in the \n\nprevious section, no effect of excessive oxygen content on the transport properties has been found. Formation \n\nof Mn2+ species does not result in a noticeable contribution of n-type conductivity, and the total conductivity \n\nis substantially suppressed under reducing conditions, as shown in Figs. 1.3.3 - 1.3.5. Due to substantial \n\noxygen losses and worse stability of manganites doped with alkali-earth cations, the effect of the acceptor \n\ncontent under low p(O2) conditions is not obvious; examples are shown in Table 1.3.2 and Fig. 1.3.3. \n\nIn terms of the total conductivity, manganites seem more preferable in comparison with chromite \n\nanalogues; the values of the electronic transport of (La,Sr)MnO3\u00b1? may be as high as 50 - 100 S/cm at p(O2) = \n\n10-18 -10-15 atm [323]. One should note that the p(O2) range indicated is located close to the decomposition \n\nboundary and the high level of the electronic transport may be attributed to kinetic stabilization of the \n\nperovskite phase or a contribution of the decomposition products into the overall conductivity. Therefore, \n\nlong-term tests are required to assess the stability of the transport characteristics of manganites. \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \n\n-20 -15 -10 -5 0\n\nlog p(O2) (atm)\n\n1.2\n\n1.6\n\n2.0\n\n2.4\n\n2.8\n\n3.2\n\nlo\ng \n\n?\n (\n\nS\n/c\n\nm\n)\n\n1223 K\nLa0.96Ba0.04MnO3\u00b1?

As a general \n\nrule, increasing the content of stabilizing dopant (Cr, Ti, Sc, Ga, Al etc.) reduces the conductivity in both \n\noxidizing and reducing conditions [16, 315, 319], attributable to a decrease of the concentration of sites \n\navailable for the electronic transport. No contribution of n-type conductivity has been found for Ti- or Nb-\n\ndoped manganites [16, 19, 20] which indicates that a preliminary reduction step might be required to activate \n\nelectron charge carriers, similar to other Ti- or Nb-rich compositions [73, 97, 98, 105].  \n\n \n\nTable 1.3.2.

Isothermal dependencies of the total conductivity of selected manganites vs p(O2) at 973 - 1223 K \n \n \n\nIn case of decomposition of stabilized manganites, formation of phases enriched with Al, Ga, Ti, \n\netc. with high resistivity is expected which may be more detrimental in terms of the transport properties and \n\ncatalytic activity than formation of RP-manganites or MnO. As shown in p(O2) dependencies of the \n\nconductivity (Figs. 1.3.3 -1.3.5), larger values of the electronic transport were exhibited by (La,Sr)MnO3\u00b1? or \n\nmanganites substituted by Fe, Co or Ni cations, despite their insufficient stability. Therefore, one should find \n\nthe compromise between the transport properties, stability and other characteristics. \n\nAnother limitation of manganite-based anodes, especially those stabilized by cations in B-sublattice \n\nrelates to their enhanced activation energy at low p(O2) which amounts to 30 - 50 kJ/mol for perovskites with \n\n~50 mol.% of Mn and increases with the concentration of B-site dopant [16, 20, 319, 325]. This necessitates \n\napplication of high temperatures to achieve reasonable anode performances, with a risk to promote the \n\ninteraction between the cell components. \n\nDilatometric curves of LaMnO3\u00b1? in air exhibit a change in slope on heating at 550 - 600 K, possibly \n\nassociated with the onset of oxygen losses and resultant transformation of the low-temperature orthorhombic \n\nstructure into the rhombohedral symmetry [131, 299]. Doping with alkali-earth cation increases the TEC \n\n(Table 1.3.3), more pronounced for the dopants with larger ionic radii.

While the chemical strains in LaCrO3-? are essentially negligible within the \n\nuncertainties of the experimental technique, LaMnO3\u00b1? on reduction exhibits the expansion up to 0.1%. \n\nConsistently, among the perovskites with substantial amount of Mn, the lowest strains were found for \n\n(La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-?-based compositions. In the oxygen-deficient region, the thermomechanical behavior of \n\nmanganites is governed by relationships similar to those described in the corresponding section for chromites \n\n[234, 236]. In some cases, redox cycling of manganites is accompanied by irreversible microstructural \n\nchanges, resulting in mechanical degradation [16, 317]. \n\nThe expansion behavior of manganites in oxygen-excessive region is less obvious. Appart from the \n\ncommon factors responsible for the thermomechanical properties of most perovskites, such as variations of \n\nthe oxidation state of Mn species, generation of cation vacancies leading to an enhancement of the number of \n\nunit cells [331-334], the expansivity of manganites may be influenced by slow equilibration, ceramics \n\ndensification, cracking, etc [16, 238, 335]. \n\nThe dimensional instability in the high p(O2) range makes it necessary to suppress the oxygen \n\noverstoichiometry. Even if the reduction of oxygen-rich manganites causes a shrinkage which might \n\ncompensate the subsequent low-p(O2) expansion, exposure of the material to periodic volume changes may \n\nbe detrimental for the mechanical integrity of the anode layers. While chromites show nearly linear \n\nrelationship between the amount of alkali-earth dopant and chemical strains on reduction, for manganite \n\nperovskites the presence of moderate quantities of acceptor dopants is beneficial which, however, should be \n\ncompromised by stability and dimensional behavior at low p(O2). \n\n \n\nTable 1.3.4.

The ionic transfer proceeds via vacancy mechanism, and the diffusivity may to some extent \n\nbe enhanced by formation of oxygen vacancies generated by introduction of alkali-earth cations or reduction, \n\nas shown in Tables 1.3.5 - 1.3.6. However, under low p(O2) conditions, the effect of acceptor content is weak \n\n[305]. Generation of A-site deficiency basically has no substantial effect on the ionic transport which may \n\nindicate the defect association or that the charge compensation in the latter case is realized by Mn oxidation \n\nrather than by the formation of oxygen vacancies [336].  \n\nA correlation between the chemical diffusion and surface exchange kinetics for (La,Sr)(Mn,Co)O3-? \n\nperovskites was found [337, 338] indicating that the oxygen exchange processes are governed by the \n\navailability of the oxygen vacancies on the surface. Although the oxygen ionic transport in manganites is \n\nhigher in comparison with chromite analogues, this level is still insufficient to expect a substantial promotion \n\nof the electrochemical processes; for example, the ionic conductivity of La1-xSrxMnO3-? (x = 0.05 - 0.2) is as \n\nlow as 10-7-10-6 S/cm at 1273 K under oxidizing conditions. Similar to chromites, the diffusion may be \n\ncontributed by oxygen transport along the grain boundaries [336, 339]. \n\nThe values of the activation energy of the chemical or oxygen vacancy diffusion in manganites are \n\ngenerally larger (200 - 300 kJ/mol) in comparison with those for chromite analogues. Such a difference is \n\nattributed to high enthalpies of the vacancy formation in manganites [338], variations in Mn-O bond strength \n\nowing to variations in Mn oxidation state [336], or defect interactions [305, 327, 336, 340]. The dominant \n\ncontribution of the enthalpy of oxygen vacancy formation into the activation energy was confirmed by \n\nincreasing activation energy with Sr-doping [336, 338], while facilitation of oxygen release by introduction \n\nof Fe or Co results in lower activation energies [338, 339]. \n\n \n\nTable 1.3.5.

As discusses above, the equilibration in this domain of conditions is slow, \n\nand the experimental results are affected by material preparation route and experimental procedure. \n\nTherefore, direct comparison of the experimental data under high p(O2) is complicated (Table 1.3.5).  \n\n \n\n1.3.3. Electrochemical behavior in reducing atmospheres \n \nComparing the polarization resistance and power densities of electrochemical cells based on \n\nmanganite anodes (Fig. 1.3.6 and Table 1.3.5) with those for chromite analogues, one may notice a somewhat \n\nsuperior activity of the manganites. In particular, while non-modified La0.85Sr0.15CrO3-? anode showed \n\n\n\n59 \n\n \n\nextremely low electrode performance [17], a satisfactory anode activity was detected for La1-xSrxMnO3-? \n\nanodes, increasing with Sr content up to 630 mW/cm2 for x = 0.5 at 1273 K in 3% H2O - H2 [95]. However, \n\nno compositional or microstructural modifications or anode current collectors were indicated in both cases \n\nwhich complicates the comparison. Higher Sr content in manganites allows to reduce Ohmic and polarization \n\nlosses; both contributions to the overall resistance show a correlation with the electronic conductivity of the \n\nperovskites in oxidative atmospheres indicating that the phase decomposition of (La,Sr)MnO3-? expected \n\nunder anode conditions might be hindered by kinetic reasons. The electrodes are tolerant towards one redox \n\ncycle, although more severe stability tests are necessary, especially accounting for the large chemical \n\nexpansivity of the materials. \n\nFor Al, Sc, Ti, Ga-doped manganites, the performance is basically better for Mn-enriched electrode \n\ncompositions. The preferability of Mn-rich perovskites as well as higher activity of manganites over other \n\nperovskite anodes such as chromites and titanates may be associated with the following factors: \n\n1. High Mn content ensures enhanced electronic conductivity (compare the data in Table 1.3.2 and \n\nTable 1.2.1) and promotes higher oxygen diffusion under reducing conditions, although the presence of \n\nmoderate amounts of 3-valent cations in B-sublattice is also favorable for the ionic transport [320, 328]. The \n\nsufficient level of the electronic and ionic conductivity provides a reasonable rate of supply/removal of \n\nelectrons, oxygen vacancies to/from the electrochemically active sites on the electrode surface or at the TPB. \n\n2. Mn cations are stable in multiple oxidation states (+2, +3 and +4), as discussed in Chapter 1.3.1 \n\n[234, 300, 324], and may adopt various oxygen coordination (tetrahedral, square pyramidal, octahedral) \n\n(examples may be found in [249, 344-346] and references cited). This favors stabilization of numerous forms \n\nof Mn-containing species participating in the electrochemical processes and allows to maintain catalytically-\n\nactive species on the anode surface.

High solubility of Mn in zirconia provides good adhesion of the manganite electrode layers to \n\nZrO2-based electrolytes which may contribute the performance due to microstructural factors, especially in \n\nYSZ-containing composites [306, 349-352]. \n\nIn accordance with the factors listed above, promising power densities were produced for \n\nLa0.8Sr0.2Mn0.9Sc0.1O3-? perovskite anode activated by CeO2, Ag, Pd and impregnated into YSZ scaffolds \n\n(~700 mW/cm2 in 3% H2O - H2 and 450 mW/cm\n2 in 3% H2O - CH4 at 1073 K) [306]. The power density as \n\nhigh as ~360 mW/cm2 at 1129 K in wet H2 was yielded for La0.4Sr0.6Mn0.6Ti0.4O3-? - YSZ (50 - 50 wt.%) with \n\nYSZ electrolyte of 200 \u00b5 m thickness. This value of the power density is not a limit for this cell, since it \n\ncorresponds to the voltage of 0.7 V. The result is, however, interfered by the presence of Au paste. The anode \n\npolarization resistance under given conditions is ~0.3 Ohm\u00d7cm2 [16]; a close value was obtained for A-\n\ndeficient (La0.8Sr0.2)0.94Mn0.5Al0.5O3-? - YSZ (65 - 35 vol.%) composite anode covered with Au paste [317]. \n\nThe level of the polarization resistances observable for manganite anodes studied in the present section is \n\nsomewhat higher in comparison with Cr-substituted manganites. One should note that the latter group of \n\ncompositions has been studied more extensively and more compositional and microstructural improvements \n\nhave been elaborated. \n\nThe insufficient stability of manganites, large chemical expansion and strong reactivity with \n\nelectrolytes make the problem of long-term performance critical for their practical applications as anodes. \n\nWhile the anode La0.4Sr0.6Mn0.6Ti0.4O3-? - YSZ showed only a slight initial increase in polarization and Ohmic \n\nresistance in H2 at 1068 K (~10% per 200 hours) [16], the degradation rate for La0.8Sr0.2Mn0.5Al0.5O3-? - YSZ \n\nunder similar condition was more than 100% in terms of the overvoltage for 100 hours of testing. While the \n\nOhmic drop might be recovered by redox cycling, the increase in the polarization resistance was irreversible, \n\napparently due to mechanical degradation [317]. \n\nLa0.8Sr0.2Mn0.8Sc0.2O3-? exhibited a rapid degradation of performance (70%/3 hours) in CO under \n\nopen circuit voltage (OCV) while oxidation of the anode induced by anodic polarization or addition of CO2 \n\ninto the fuel allowed to suppress the drop of the power density indicating that the material is close to the \n\nphase boundary under anode environments [316]. However, similar anode material showed a satisfactory \n\nstability towards fuel cell tests in CH4 [315], possibly due to inhibited methane reforming over the manganite \n\nwhich enables to preserve the local oxygen pressure high enough to stabilize the perovskite. \n\nSummarizing the results observable on manganite-based anodes one should note that the dominant \n\npart of the electrodes studied contains large amounts of additives, in particular a layer of metal-containing \n\npaste. These modifications do not allow to evaluate the applicability of manganite-based anodes in industrial \n\nscale. One should take into account that high-temperature utilization of manganites may be detrimental in \n\nterms of poor chemical stability, drop in the electronic conductivity, microstructural changes and mechanical \n\ndegradation of the electrode layers. Therefore, for industrial application of (La,A)MnO3-?-based anodes \n\nwithout expensive modifications one should achieve reasonable performances at comparatively low \n\ntemperatures (950 - 1100 K). Reviewing the available data on manganites, no proper anode composition has \n\nbeen found by far. At the same time, the attractive characteristics of manganite perovskites offer many \n\npossibilities to improve both activity and stability by compositional modifications. \n\n \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \n\n1.4. La(Cr,Mn)O3-?-based electrode materials \n\n \n\nA brief description of (Ln,A)(Cr,Mn)O3-?-based materials (LnACM) and corresponding anodes has \n\nbeen given in the sections devoted to chromites and manganites. One of the most widely studied \n\nrepresentatives is La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-?, since this material possesses a good combination of the chemical \n\nand thermomechanical properties, electronic transport and catalytic activity. On the other hand, further \n\noptimization of the composition can be achieved. This material and its derivatives are characterized by a \n\nstructural transition on heating or reduction which, however, has no detrimental effects on the transport or \n\nthermomechanical properties [113, 177]. In reducing atmospheres, small quantities of MnO and Ln2O3 or \n\nRP-phases may be separated [207, 216, 222], while Ruiz-Morales et al. reported a possibility of formation of \n\nordered structures, which, however, might also relate to the RP-manganites [353]. While under oxidizing \n\nconditions the conductivity increases on A-site doping (Ca>Sr>Ba) [144] and with Mn content [210], in \n\nanodic atmospheres this trend depends on the facility and kinetics of the oxygen losses, as shown in Fig. \n\n1.2.4 and Table 1.2.1. The conductivity of LnACM materials at low p(O2) varies in the range 0.2 - 5 S/cm, \n\nclose to the minimum acceptable for the anode application. \n\nThe thermal expansion coefficients of LnACM are close or slightly higher than those of SOFC \n\nelectrolytes or interconnects. The chemical expansivity for Ln = La is 0.2 - 0.3 % at 1073 - 1273 K, p(O2) = \n\n10-18 - 10-13 atm [10, 235]. Replacement of La by Ce increases the expansion up to 0.45 - 0.7% on mild \n\nreduction and causes the phase decomposition at p(O2) lower than 10\n-14 - 10-11 atm [207]. Due to variations of \n\nionic radii of the B-cations, different reducibility and electron exchange between Cr and Mn species and \n\nMn3+ disproportionation, the effect of Mn:Cr ratio at various cation compositions on the expansion may be \n\nopposite [10, 207, 235]. Despite the moderate expansivity, poor adhesion of La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? to YSZ \n\nwas reported [354]; this drawback can be solved by fabrication of composites. \n\nIn comparison with Cr-rich perovskites, the ionic transport and surface kinetics are substantially \n\nenhanced for LnACM, especially under reducing conditions [10, 258]. This is attributed to higher tendency \n\nof Mn-containing perovskites towards formation of oxygen vacancies [8]. The presence of Mn is expected to \n\npromote participation of bulk oxygen in oxidation processes [347]. At the same time, the ionic transport is \n\nobviously insufficient for adequate performance; in particular, this is reflected by reducing the polarization \n\nfor composites of LnACM with ionic conductors (Figs. 1.4.1 - 1.4.2, Table 1.4.1)  \n\nLa0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? and Pr0.7Ca0.3(Cr,Mn)O3-? are chemically compatible with YSZ at 1573 and \n\n1473 K, respectively [8, 210, 277]. Despite the decreased phase stability, the presence of Ce ensures better \n\nchemical compatibility with YSZ in air, while in Ar or H2, formation of SrZrO3 and strong interdiffusion \n\nwere observed [222]. In contact of La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? with LSGM, the interaction was observed at \n\n1623 - 1673 K [279, 280]. No interaction or interdiffusion between La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? and Co-\n\nsubstituted LSGM was detected up to 1573 K [355]; the anode material exhibited also the chemical \n\ncompatibility with Ni at 1673 K which facilitates the fabrication of composites. \n\nOn the other hand, Mn possesses enhanced diffusivity [324, 356], and analogously with manganite-\n\nbased electrodes, application of LnACM necessitates application of buffer layers between the electrode and \n\nelectrolyte. The diffusivity of Mn is promoted by A-cation deficiency; however, one should take into account \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\nthat for cation-stoichiometric perovskites, depletion with Mn induces phase decomposition with formation of \n\nphases enriched with A-cations. Since electrodes based on cation-stoichiometric perovskites basically require \n\nelevated preparation temperatures [357] and are more susceptible towards the high-temperature interdiffusion \n\nor decomposition, application of A-deficient perovskite electrodes may be beneficial. \n\nOne of advantages of LnACM-based compositions is some catalytic activity towards oxidation \n\nprocesses; this makes the materials attractive as a component of catalysts or anodes in hydrocarbon fuels. In \n\nparticular, higher content of La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? in composite with CGO increases the open circuit \n\nvoltage of a cell with CH4-containing atmosphere on the anode side, indicating an enhanced conversion over \n\nLa0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? [284]. As suggested in [348, 358], Mn-doping into LnACM promotes the oxidation \n\nprocesses which proceed via Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism where the bulk oxygen ions participate in the \n\noxidation; the activity is higher for Mn-enriched perovskites [347]. The effect of Mn species originates from \n\nthe capability of Mn3+ species to accept electrons in chemisorption step producing low-coordinated Mn2+ and \n\nrelease CO2 and H2O [218]. In H2, the oxidation process is considered to be limited by the chemisorption step \n\nrather than by diffusion of O2- and subsequent oxidation of Mn2+. Formation of Mn2+ reduces the electronic \n\nconduction and decreases the number of available sites for chemisorption [218]. This behaviour is consistent \n\nwith observation of McIntosh et al [347] where formation of oxygen vacancies reduces CH4 conversion over \n\nLa0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? and increases the fraction of CO in the product mixture. The material promotes \n\nessentially partial oxidation and dry reforming, while the rate of the wet reforming is slow. \n\nWhatever the oxidation mechanism, the catalytic activity of pure LnACM perovskites is insufficient \n\nfor utilizing these materials as individual anode [348]; in combination with the disadvantages caused by the \n\ntransport properties, compositional modifications of the electrodes are required. Positive effects of additions \n\nof Pd, Rh, Fe, Ni or ceria have been demonstrated [10, 14, 359, 360], possibly due to improved catalytic \n\nactivity. In particular, surface modification of the perovskite electrodes with Pd was shown to improve the \n\nactivity in CH4 and ethanol, without significant effect on the performance in H2 [361-363]. \n\nAt the same time, the most important factor determining the performance of LnACM anodes is \n\ninsufficient electronic conductivity. In particular, for non-modified La0.7A0.3Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? anodes, the \n\nperformance increased in the order Ba<Sr<Ca, consistently with the electronic conduction and stability of the \n\nmaterials [144]. A similar correlation was observed for LaCr0.5Mn0.5O3-? and La0.8Sr0.2Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? anodes, \n\nwhere the former composition possesses higher electronic conduction and catalytic activity at low p(O2) \n\n[171]. Analogously, increasing Mn content in Pr0.7Ca0.3Cr1-xMnxO3-? from x = 0.2 to 0.8 leads to ~1 order \n\nenhancement of the conductivity and anode performance [210]. Apart from increasing the polarization \n\nresistance, the insufficient conductivity leads to higher Ohmic drops [171]. On the other hand, the anodic \n\npolarization may induce partial oxidation of the perovskite resulting in higher electronic transport. \n\nThe role of the electronic conductivity of LnACM in the electrochemical processes is also \n\nconfirmed by positive effects of addition of metallic phase or optimization of the current collector on the \n\npolarization. In particular, an improvement of the anode performance by impregnation of \n\nLa0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? with Cu was demonstrated in [218, 361, 353, 364]. Since contribution of Cu into the \n\ncatalytic activity is suggested to be insignificant [353, 364, 365], the smaller polarization losses are attributed \n\nto the improved electronic transport. \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \n\nTable 1.4.1.

The presence of CeO2-?-based phases in the composite anode also diminishes the Ea, possibly due to \n\ncontribution to the electronic transport, although increased ionic conduction or catalytic activity may have the \n\nactivating effect as well. At the same time, introducing YSZ into the anode increases the activation energy \n\nattributable to worse percolation of the electron-conductive paths in the composite or to a change of the \n\nelectrode mechanism. \n\nThe anode La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? with Au paste current collector exhibited quite reasonable \n\npower densities (400 - 600 mW/cm2 at 1073 K) in H2 - H2O - Ar fuel with LSGM electrolyte as thick as 2 \n\nmm; however, no stability was checked in the study [279]. Impregnation of the anode with Pt and Cu allows \n\nto achieve power densities as high as 850 mW/cm2 in dry H2 at 1123 K and 450 mW/cm\n2 in dry CH4 at 1073 \n\nK [218]. Stable performance (for at least 24 hours) of 320 - 550 mW/cm2 and R? of  0.18 - 0.29 Ohm\u00d7cm\n2 at \n\n1223 K was observed for La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? - YSZ - Pt composite electrode in wet H2 atmospheres, \n\nwhile in wet CH4, the power density and R? were 350 mW/cm\n2 and 0.26 Ohm\u00d7cm2, respectively [366]. \n\nComposite anodes based on (La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-? showed a noticeable activity towards conversion of wet C3H8 \n\n[367], wet ethanol [368] (stable for 60 hours), 0.5% H2S - CH4 [212]. The preferability of \n\nLa0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? - Cu anodes over analogous CGO - Cu cermets was reported [364]. \n\n \n \n1.5. Perovskite-related titanates with high electronic conductivity \n\n \n\nThe present section concerns phase and structural relationships, their influence on the electronic, \n\noxygen- and hydrogen ionic conductivity as well as on the thermomechanical and electrochemical behaviour. \n\nA particular attention is focused on kinetic factors which are essentially important for titanate-based \n\nmaterials. Although Ti-enriched solid oxides include several structural groups such as pyrochlores, tungsten \n\nbronzes, spinels, etc. which may also be regarded as potential candidates for the anode utilization ([7, 14, 91, \n\n102, 103] and references cited), the present consideration will be restricted by ATiO3-? (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) \n\ncompositions and their derivatives possessing the perovskite structure. \n\n \n\n1.5.1. Defect chemistry mechanisms under oxidizing and reducing conditions \n\n \nThe defect structure of titanate-based compositions significantly differs from that of previously \n\nconsidered perovskites. Since Cr and Mn can exist in 4+/3+ or 4+/3+/2+ oxidation state, respectively, in a \n\nwide operational range of oxygen pressures, the corresponding compositions are tolerant towards reasonable \n\nintroduction of aliovalent dopants, without any significant formation of secondary phases, while the \n\nfunctional characteristics of the materials continuously change with the concentration of the substituent. In \n\ntitanates, Ti4+ dominates under oxidizing conditions; the onset of generation of noticeable fractions of Ti3+ is \n\nlocated at p(O2)<10\n-7 atm at 1473 K [371]. Therefore, titanates are much less flexible towards doping in \n\nterms of the phase purity, and their defect chemistry is strongly related with variations in the phase \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\ncomposition. For simplicity, the basic relationships of the defect chemistry will be given for model \n\ncomposition SrTiO3-? and its derivatives, although similar equations are also relevant for CaTiO3-?- and \n\nBaTiO3-?-based analogues. \n\nGeneralized approaches consider that the defect species in undoped SrTiO3-? are electrons ( e? ), holes \n\n( hi ) and vacancies in Sr, Ti and O sublattices, denoted as \nSrV??\n\n, ''''\nTiV\n\n and \nOV\nii . The corresponding concentrations \n\nare denoted as n, p, \nSr[V ]??\n\n, ''''\nTi[V ]\n\n and \nO[V ]\nii . Moreover, most titanates are susceptible towards minor amounts of \n\nacceptor-type impurities [372-375] and the conductivity trends may adequately be described only assuming \n\nthe presence of acceptor cations in A or B sublattice, schematically denoted as \nCA?\n with the concentration \n\nC[A ]?\n. Within the model considered below, the distribution of the acceptor between A- and B-sublattices is \n\nconsidered to be non-important in terms of the transport properties. \n\nThe defect chemistry in undoped SrTiO3-? is associated with the processes of oxygen vacancy \n\nformation and dissolution of SrO in the perovskite structure, with the expression of the equilibrium constants: \n\n \n\n2 +1/2\nO 2=[V ] p(O )reK n\nii   (Eq. 1.5.1)  \n\n'''' 2\nSr O Ti O\n\nSrO\n\n[Sr ][O ][V ][V ]\n=\n\na\nB\n\nK\n\u00d7 \u00d7 ii   (Eq. 1.5.2) \n\n \n\nThe equilibrium is governed by the electron-hole generation and the processes of Shottky-disorder as: \n\n \n\n=\ni\n\nK np     (Eq. 1.5.3) \n\n'' '''' 3\nSr Ti O=[V ][V ][V ]SK\n\nii   (Eq. 1.5.4) \n\n \nDepending on the values of the equilibrium constants and the level of intentionally introduced or \n\nbackground impurities \nC[A ]?\n\n, the compensation mechanism is strongly affected by the cation stoichiometry \n\nand oxygen pressure. Selected examples of the compensation mechanisms for BaTiO3-? as well as the slopes \n\nof the fraction of p- and n-type carriers vs. p(O2) (in logarithmic scale) are shown in Fig. 1.5.1. \n\nOne of peculiarities of titanate-based perovskites is the appearance of p-type and n-type branches of \n\nthe total conductivity, observable even on undoped titanates. The generation of large amounts of holes is \n\ncompensated by formation of cation vacancies in A- or B-sublattice. In accordance with the diagram, the \n\nslopes in the logarithmic plot of the total conductivity vs. p(O2) for SrTiO3-? should change in the order -1/6, -\n\n1/4, +1/4, +1/6 upon oxidation, assuming comparable mobilities of p- and n-type electronic carriers. In \n\npractice, the value of p(O2) corresponding to the change in the value of the positive slope is generally located \n\nbeyond the experimental conditions. Increasing the temperature favors the formation of oxygen vacancies \n\nand thus shifts the changes in the compensation mechanisms to higher values of p(O2). Although the oxygen \n\ndeficiency as large as 0.28 was observed in SrTiO3-? [376], under typical experimental conditions variations \n\nin the oxygen content on redox cycling in SrTiO3-? and BaTiO3-? do not exceed 0.002 - 0.004 per perovskite \n\nformula unit [248, 377-379]. Nevertheless, even such negligible changes in the defect concentration cause a \n\n~2-fold enhancement of the n-type conductivity. \n\n\n\n68 \n\n \n\n \nFig. 1.5.1. Diagrams showing the defect equilibria in BaTiO3-? [372] depending on the equilibrium constants, \ncontent of acceptor-type dopant, p(O2) and activity of BaO. The equations correspond to the compensation \nmode; m is the slope of the dependencies log p = m log p(O2) and log n = -m log p(O2) under given \nconditions. Red lines correspond to cation-stoichiometric composition. \n\n \n\nIn accordance with the diagrams (Figs. 1.5.1 - 1.5.2) even minor deviations from the cation \n\nstoichiometry or a contamination of titanates with donor- or acceptor-type impurities significantly affects the \n\ndefect equilibrium ([372, 373, 380] and references cited). This leads to large discrepancies between the data \n\non the total conductivity obtained in various studies; the difference is especially pronounced in the range of \n\np-n transition and on the branch of p-type conductivity, due to a relatively small concentration of the charge \n\ncarriers and their strong susceptibility towards the factors discussed above. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 1.5.2. Isothermal dependencies of equilibrium dopant concentrations (A, B, C) and n-type charge carriers \nconcentration (D) vs. p(O2) for selected titanates. The diagrams are taken from [374, 381, 382] \n\n\n\n69 \n\n \n\nDue to relatively small cation radii of Ca and Sr, the formation of A-site cation vacancies dominates \n\nin CaTiO3-? and SrTiO3-? [381, 383-385]. Whenever the cation vacancy compensation mechanism is realized \n\nin CaTiO3-? or SrTiO3-?, this results in separation of Ca- or Sr-enriched phases or, more likely, generation of \n\ndomains of RP-intergrowths in the perovskite structure [375, 381, 385]. The ratios of Ca:Ti or Sr:Ti where \n\nsingle perovskite phase exists are scattered in the literature and strongly depend on the processing conditions. \n\nThe acceptable level of Ca- or Sr-deficiency varies in the range 0.1 - 10% [376, 386-390], while Sr:Ti ratio as \n\nlow as 0.8:1 causes formation of superstructures with ordering in A- and O-sublattice [391]. For Ca1+xTiO3-?, \n\nthe maximum acceptable value of x was assessed up to 0.01% [392]; similar value for Sr1+xTiO3-? was \n\nevaluated as 0.2% [390]. \n\nIn contrast, the high-p(O2) charge compensation in BaTiO3-? is accompanied by dominating \n\nformation of Ti vacancies [371, 393, 394] causing separation of Ti-enriched phases, such as BaTi2O5, \n\nBa6Ti11O40, etc. [371, 381, 382, 395]. The perovskite phase exists in a narrow domain of Ba:Ti ratio; the \n\nexcess of Ba or Ti should not exceed 0.1 - 1 mol.% [382, 396].  No formation RP-phases has been reported \n\nfor BaTiO3-? [381, 397]. On the other hand, an enrichment of BaTiO3-? with rare-earth cations allows to \n\nstabilize the RP-structures [398]. \n\nAn important feature of the titanates of alkali-earth metals is their complex structural behavior. \n\nCaTiO3-? is orthorhombically-distorted perovskite (S.G.: Pbmn) adopting the tetragonal perovskite structure \n\nat 1500 - 1600 K, followed by the transformation into the cubic symmetry at 1635 K [399, 400]. On heating \n\nfrom the room temperature, BaTiO3-? consequently exhibits transformations from tetragonal (S.G.: P4mm) \n\ninto cubic (393 K) and into hexagonal structure (~1700 K) possessing S.G.: P63/mmc [401, 402]. In terms of \n\nthe structural stability, SrTiO3-? is more preferable for the high-temperature applications, since this perovskite \n\nexists in the cubic modification ( 3Pm m ) at T>105 K, without transformations on heating [403, 404]. \n\nIntroduction of nonreducible rare-earth donor cations (i.e. Ln) into A-sublattice is accompanied by \n\neither electronic compensation at low p(O2) or cation vacancy formation taking place under oxidizing \n\nconditions [388, 405]. The 3rd possibility involving the formation of ordered structures where Ti may be \n\nstabilized in 3+ state at atmospheric oxygen pressure is beyond the present consideration. If the cation \n\nstoichiometry does not support any of the mechanisms, the compensation is accompanied by the formation of \n\nsecondary phases. For example, stoichiometric (Sr,La)TiO3-? may be synthesized at low p(O2) due to \n\nequivalent formation of Ti3+ species; however, their oxidation destabilizes the  perovskite structure with \n\nresultant formation of  Sr-enriched impurities or, as a particular case, RP-titanate intergrowths in the \n\nperovskite structure (schematically denoted as SrO) [406, 407]: \n\n1-x x 3 2 1-3x x 3\n2\n\n2 x x\n Sr La TiO  +  O  =  Sr La TiO  +  SrO\n\n2-x 4 2\n   (Eq. 1.5.5) \n\n \n\nIn contrast, generation of appropriate amounts of cation vacancies results in stabilization of titanates \n\nin air. However, the coexistence of vacancies in A- and O-sublattice in reducing atmospheres makes the \n\nexcess of Ti unfavorable in terms of the phase stability which results in separation of Magneli phases TinO2n-\n\n1, Magneli layers accommodated into the perovskite structure or other Ti-rich compositions [377, 388, 406]: \n\n\n\n70 \n\n \n\n2-3x x 3 2-3x 2x 3 2 2\n2 2-x 2-x\n\n2 x x\n Sr La TiO  =  Sr La TiO  +  TiO  +  O\n\n2-x 2-x 4-2x\n (Eq. 1.5.6) \n\n \n\nSimilar relationships were observed on introduction of donor dopants into B-sublattice. In particular, \n\nNb5+ is less reducible in comparison with Ti4+, and Nb-substitution into BaTiO3-? with overall deficiency of \n\nB-cations results in formation of single phase perovskite in air and segregation of Ba-enriched impurities in \n\nN2. In contrast, BaTi0.94Nb0.06O3-? is single phase perovskite when prepared in N2, while oxidation provokes \n\ngeneration of Ti-vacancies in the perovskite and decomposition into Ti-enriched compounds. Such a behavior \n\nis consistent with the examples presented for (Sr,La)TiO3-? system, with the exception that BaTiO3-? shows \n\nthe tendency towards Ti vacancy formation ([395] and references cited). \n\nWhatever the phase relationships, donor doping into ATiO3-? induces the appearance of a region \n\nwhere the amount of charge carriers (and, consequently, the electronic conductivity) is independent of p(O2) \n\n(Fig. 5.2). One should note that within the defect model considered by most authors ([381, 395] and \n\nreferences therein), the defect concentration is considered to be independent of Ln content under fixed p(O2) \n\nin the low oxygen pressure region. However, such a simplification assumes an equal level of the oxygen \n\ndeficiency for titanates with various donor amounts. Analysis of the literature data on reducibility does not \n\nallow to verify this suggestion since apparent variations of oxygen content upon redox cycling might be \n\nattributed to formation/dissolution of the secondary phases capable to accommodate/release large oxygen \n\namounts [247, 248, 408-410]. \n\nHigher amounts of donor dopants increase the n-type conductivity in the intermediate- and high-\n\np(O2) regions and expand the domain of p(O2)-independent conductivity. Considering the behavior of Nb- or \n\nV-doped titanates, one should mention that under severe high-temperature reducing conditions Ti3+ coexists \n\nwith the corresponding cations in low oxidation states. This leads to a substantial oxygen uptake observable \n\non oxidation (0.05 - 0.1 per perovskite formula unit) in comparison with other titanate materials [410, 411] \n\nand may cause significant irreversible changes of the functional properties. \n\nReduction of cation stoichiometric Sr1-xLaxTiO3-? enables to dissolve up to x = 0.3 - 0.4 with \n\npreservation of single cubic perovskite structure [412, 413]. In air, the solubility drops down to 4% [414, \n\n415]; on further doping, La2Ti2O7 is separated. A possibility of preparation of heavily-doped (30 - 40%) Sr1-\n\nxLaxTiO3-? in air has been reported [105, 409]; in [105], the cubic perovskite phases were stable on annealing \n\nat 1923 K in air and under reducing conditions. These results seem to be affected by kinetic stabilization or \n\nlow sensitivity of the examination techniques towards formation of impurities or superstructures, since \n\nSr0.6La0.4TiO3-? should contain at least 40% of Ti\n3+, which is hardly possible in oxidizing atmospheres. More \n\nreliable in this respect seems the separation of Sr-rich phases which forms Sr-O layers in the perovskite \n\nstructure with A-site deficiency, similar to RP-phases (mainly, Sr2TiO4-?, Sr3Ti2O7-?, etc.)  [408, 416, 417]. \n\nSuch a structure enables to accommodate both Sr vacancies (in perovskite blocks) and excessive oxygen and \n\nstrontium (in Sr-O planes) and thus realize the charge compensation in air. \n\nIntroducing equivalent amounts of A-site cation vacancies in Sr1-3x/2LaxTiO3-? ensures La solubility \n\nup to x = 0.4 in air [377, 418] with the preservation of the cubic structure; further generation of cation \n\nvacancies induces short- or long-range ordering in A-sublattice [96, 418, 419]. Sr0.7La0.2TiO3-? was reported \n\n\n\n71 \n\n \n\nto be stable under reducing and oxidizing conditions [420], possibly due to kinetic factors. Increasing La \n\ncontent up to 20 - 40% promotes the transition tetragonal-cubic at 300 - 450 K on heating in air [418]. \n\nThe solubility of Y in cation-stoichiometric SrTiO3-? is as low as 1% [414]; reduction allows to \n\naccommodate up to 7% of Y without destabilization of the cubic perovskite structure. On the other hand, \n\naccording to Das et al. [421], Ca1-xYxTiO3-? and Sr1-xYxTiO3-? solid solutions exist in the entire compositional \n\nrange. The maximum content of Y in A-site vacancy-compensated (Sr,Y)TiO3-? is assessed to be 4 - 8% [406, \n\n410, 414] and may be preserved down to reducing conditions. Exceeding Y content results in separation of \n\nY2Ti2O7 and TiO2 rather than to generation of RP-phases [406, 414, 422]. \n\nCaTiO3-?-based perovskites exhibit essentially the same phase relationships as SrTiO3-?-based \n\nanalogues. Ca1-xLaxTiO3-? might be produced single-phase in air with presumably GdFeO3-like orthorhombic \n\nstructure (S.G.: Pbnm) in the range 0?x?0.3 [423]. Further enrichment with La results in transition into \n\nthe 3R c  symmetry and a gradual accumulation of Ca2La4Ti6O20 and CaLa4Ti5O17 phases [423]. Similar to Sr- \n\nor La-rich (Sr,La)TiO3-?, formation of RP-titanate superstructures is also relevant to (Ca,La)TiO3-? [380, 392]. \n\nFor A-site deficient Ca1-3x/2LaxTiO3-?, simple orthorhombic perovskite phase, slightly contaminated by TiO2, \n\nwas obtained up to x = 0.33 exhibiting a phase transition on La-doping owing to tilting the octahedra or \n\ncation vacancy ordering [424]. Ba1-xLaxTiO3-? may accommodate as much as 3% of La in air, the symmetry \n\nincreasing with La content [371, 425]. At higher La amounts, phases like Ba6Ti11O40 or Ba6La8Ti18O54 are \n\nseparated confirming the preferential formation of Ti vacancies in BaTiO3-?-based perovskites. \n\nNb solubility in air without intentional creation of cation vacancies may be accomplished up to 2% \n\nin SrTi1-xNbxO3-? [426]; the excessive amount is separated as Sr2NbO4 phase. On the other hand, Nb can be \n\nstabilized in the titanate structure by Ti/Nb reduction at low p(O2) or enhanced temperatures; in the latter \n\ncase, formation of Sr(Ti,Nb)O3-? may be achieved in air up to 9% Nb even with 1% deficiency in B-sublattice \n\n[413]. The cubic structure of Sr(Ti,Nb)O3-? is maintained on Nb-doping within the solubility domain. \n\nIntroducing Nb with simultaneous generation of cation vacancies (Sr1-x/2Ti1-xNbxO3-?) allows to substitute up \n\nto 40% of Ti; the materials are stable in air and under reducing conditions [96, 97]. Further enrichment with \n\nNb necessitates an additional amount of A-site vacancies for charge compensation, which causes formation \n\nof secondary phase with tetragonal tungsten bronze structure [96, 97]. For Nb-doped BaTiO3-?, Ti deficiency \n\nis necessary for Nb dissolution; the composition BaTi0.926Nb0.06O3-? was found to be stable in air forming Ba-\n\nrich phase on reduction [395]. \n\nComparing the behavior of acceptor-doped and so-called pure SrTiO3-? (Fig. 1.5.1), one may \n\nconclude that the presence of acceptors shifts the p-n transition of the total conductivity towards more \n\nreducing conditions and introduces an additional domain in the p-type conductivity branch, where the \n\nconcentration of charge carriers is essentially determined by the concentration of acceptor cations, i.e. the \n\nconductivity is p(O2)-independent. However, under experimental conditions, any accurate separation of the \n\ncompensation regimes is complicated by kinetic factors and a strong contribution of the ionic conductivity. \n\nThus, typical p(O2) dependencies of the conductivity exhibit a wide p-n transition, where the conductivity \n\nremains on a nearly constant low level. \n\nThe presence of transition metal cations which vary their oxidation state under operation conditions \n\nmay have a multiple effect on the defect chemistry of titanates, depending on the redox potential, \n\n\n\n72 \n\n \n\nconcentration, the presence of irreducible acceptor or donor atoms (including impurities), defect interactions \n\netc. As shown in Fig. 1.5.2, in Mn-doped BaTiO3-?, Mn species in the oxidation state +3 and +4 may coexist \n\nwith the electrons delocalized in 3d-conduction band of Ti atoms. Details of the defect equilibrium for \n\n(A,Ln)(Ti,B)O3-? systems (A = Ca, Sr, Ba, B = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) may be found elsewhere [155, 372, 374, \n\n412, 427-431]. Generally, the p-n transition also shifts to lower p(O2) attributable to increasing contribution \n\nof electron holes. Doping of reducible Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu promotes higher oxygen losses (0.03 - 0.05 per \n\nperovskite formula unit) [247, 335] and may significantly affect the behavior of the parent compositions. \n\nThe solubility of acceptor-type dopants with a fixed or variable oxidation state in CaTiO3-?, SrTiO3-?, \n\nBaTiO3-? has been studied in [432-439] and references cited. Depending on the oxidation state, reducibility \n\nand ionic radius of the guest atom as well as on the nature of A-cation in the titanate, the solubility of the \n\nacceptor-type cations varies in the range 5 - 40 mol. %. For example, up to 40% Al might be incorporated \n\ninto CaTiO3-?, while for SrTiO3-? analogue the solubility was limited only by 20%, possibly due to \n\ncomparatively small radius for Al3+ and Ca2+ cations ensuring the optimum tolerance factor. At the same \n\ntime, both Ca(Ti,Fe)O3-? and Sr(Ti,Fe)O3-? form a continuous series of solid solutions, with formation of \n\nordered structures at 40 - 50% of the dopant [428, 440-442]. The solubility of acceptors in titanates as well as \n\ntheir phase and structural stability may be modified by the presence of appropriate quantities of Ln3+, Nb5+ or \n\nother donor-type cations [16, 429, 431, 443, 444]. Depending on the cation ratios and synthesis conditions, \n\nsingle phase perovskites (A,La)(Ti,B)O3-? (A = Ca, Sr, B = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co) may be produced in the entire \n\nrange of Ti:B ratios, especially when Sr(Ca):Ti ratio is preserved close to 1. The crystal structure exhibits \n\northorhomic distortions on increasing Fe or Cr amount, while Mn- promotes the transition to rhombohedral \n\nsymmetry. For Co-doped (Sr,La)TiO3-? the structure was refined to be orthorhombic or rhombohedral, \n\ndepending on La and Co content [12, 16, 156, 158, 352, 431, 444, 445]. In terms of the application in a wide \n\np(O2) and temperature range, one should take into account possible phase decomposition and structural \n\ntransformations on thermal or redox cycling observable for Mn, Fe, Co or Ni-substituted titanates at low \n\np(O2) [16, 372, 429, 437, 440-442, 446]. \n\nOn the other hand, the presence of acceptor-type dopants increases the solubility limit of donor \n\nsubstituents which enables to tune the functional properties of titanates. In particular, doping of (Sr,La)TiO3-? \n\nwith Sc enables to introduce larger quantities of La with preserving the cubic perovskite structure [447]. \n\nSimilar improvement of the solubility of donor-type cations was observed for Sr0.9(Ti,Ga,Nb)O3-? and \n\n(Ca,Na)(Ti,Ta)O3-? perovskites; in the latter case,  co-introduction of Na and Ta into A- and B-sublattice of \n\nCaTiO3-? allows to stabilize the composition up to the complete substitution in both sublattices [448, 449]. \n\n \n\n1.5.2. Redox kinetics \n\n \n\nOne of most important factors influencing the functional characteristics of titanate perovskites is a \n\nstrong effect of the relaxation kinetics upon p(O2) changes on the functional properties. An incomplete \n\nequilibration causes a poor reliability of the experimental results, large scattering between literature data, \n\nhysteresis behavior of the material properties on redox cycling and their strong dependence on the synthesis \n\nconditions and measurement procedure; examples of such a behavior are presented in Fig. 1.5.3. The kinetics \n\n\n\n73 \n\n \n\nstrongly depends on the ceramics microstructure. Equilibration of porous ceramics proceeds faster, due to \n\nlarge surface area and shorter distances from the surface to the bulk phase [247, 377, 420]. However, \n\nutilization of porous ceramic samples is inappropriate for determination of the ionic conductivity while the \n\ntotal conductivity requires a correction for the porosity. At the same time, for porous anode layers, the \n\nequilibration is expected to proceed in a reasonable period. The grain size, utilization of single crystal or film \n\nsamples has also a great influence on the relaxation indicating a different rate of the bulk- and grain \n\nboundary-related processes [247, 248, 377, 450]. \n\n \n\n0 8 16 24\n\ntime, hours\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nlo\ng\n\n ?\n (\n\nS\n/c\n\nm\n)\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n0 4 8 12 16\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n<\n\n10\n3\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nSr0.85Y0.1TiO3-?

Equilibration of the total conductivity and oxygen content variations for selected titanates upon \np(O2) changes \n\n \n\n \n\nIn accordance with most studies, the redox kinetics for dense ceramic titanate-based materials is \n\ngoverned by slow oxygen diffusion in the bulk [247, 248, 377, 414]. Correspondingly, the basic trends in the \n\nequilibration rate and mechanism of the relaxation are generally consistent with the behavior of the oxygen \n\nionic conductivity. Analysis of the literature data does not allow to make a conclusion whether the rate of \n\noxidation is superior to that of reduction or contrary [105, 247, 249, 411, 420]; the faster kinetics of any of \n\nthe processes is primarily associated with individual characteristics of the sample rather than with general \n\ntrends. Most authors note that both processes proceed rapidly on the initial stage followed by subsequent drift \n\nwith much slower rate. Such a behavior indicates that oxygen incorporation/elimination into/from ceramics \n\n\n\n74 \n\n \n\nproceeds in several steps. A possible mechanism suggests that the penetration of oxygen initially occurs into \n\nregions at the interfaces between the grains. In accordance with the defect model of titanates, this results in a \n\ndrop of the population of oxygen vacancies and n-type carriers in the oxidized regions of the ceramics \n\ncausing a sharp initial decrease of the electronic conductivity. Subsequent oxidation of the material is \n\ndetermined by oxygen exchange between the oxidized exterior zone and reduced grain core. Although the \n\nprocess is driven by a large gradient in oxygen chemical potential between these states, the rate of the latter \n\nprocess is much lower [247, 248, 377, 414]. \n\nAnalogously, on the onset of supply of reductive atmosphere to preliminary oxidized titanate-based \n\nmaterials, fast reduction of the layers close to the surface of the sample or grain boundaries provides \n\npercolative paths for the electronic transport thus ensuring the initial rise of the total conductivity. Further \n\npropagation of reducing front into the grain is limited by slow oxygen diffusivity of the oxidized domains, \n\nwhile the contribution from deeper layers into the total conductivity is less significant. The decaying kinetics \n\nis also affected by increasing distance from the grain surface to the reductive front [377, 247]. \n\nIn accordance with higher oxygen vacancy concentration, an acceleration of the redox processes for \n\n(Sr,Ln)TiO3-? was observed upon introduction of low-valent Ga, Al, Sc, Fe, Co or Cu, while decreasing the \n\noxygen deficiency on V-, Nb-, La-doping inhibits the oxygen diffusion-related processes thus suppressing the \n\nequilibration rates [247, 380, 414, 447]. As a particular example, introduction of Ga into (Sr,La)TiO3-? \n\npromotes the reducibility of the parent composition due to lower oxidation state of Ga and its flexibility \n\ntowards variations in the oxygen environment. On the other hand, evaporation of Ga in reductive \n\natmospheres results in formation of Ga-depleted layer on the surface with a poor oxygen ionic conductivity, \n\nthus making the material more tolerant towards oxidation [248]. \n\nAnother important factor affecting the redox kinetics is associated with formation/dissolution of \n\nsecondary phases induced by variations of oxygen pressure. Basically, variations in the phase composition \n\nare accompanied by appearance of large stresses in the material structure or microstructure; therefore, the \n\nprocesses described by Eqs (1.5.5) - (1.5.6) proceed with inhibited rates. Moreover, the secondary phase-\n\nrelated proceses are determined by cation diffusion which is low in titanates [395, 406]. The slow rate of \n\nformation/dissolution of the impurities as well as phase transitions on redox cycles may lead to formation of \n\ninhomogeneous zones where the local composition deviates from the average one (donor-rich regions, \n\ndomains with ordered oxygen vacancies, etc.) [371, 413, 451]. \n\nSlow equilibration may significantly affect the theoretically expected behaviour, primarily in terms \n\nof electronic transport. Generally, most p(O2) dependencies of the conductivity are affected by the degree of \n\noxidation or reduction in each point rather than by the variations in the charge carrier concentration predicted \n\nby the defect model; the influence of parameters determining the kinetics on the transport properties is \n\ndemonstrated in Fig. 1.5.4. \n\nIn terms of anode applications, the slow equilibration kinetics necessitates a preliminary high-\n\ntemperature reduction of titanate-based anodes in order to achieve maximum electronic and ionic \n\nconductivity of the material. On the other hand, the susceptibility of titanates towards oxidation and resultant \n\nirreversible drop of the conductivity (Fig. 1.5.3), necessitates to avoid an occasional oxidation of the anodes. \n\nThese requirements represent one of the most serious disadvantages of titanate anodes [105, 411, 452]. \n\n\n\n75 \n\n \n\n-20 -15 -10 -5 0\n\nlog p(O2) (atm)\n\n-3.0\n\n-1.5\n\n0.0\n\n1.5\n\n3.0\n\nlo\ng \n\n?\n (\n\nS\n/c\n\nm\n)\n\n-4.5\n\n-3.0\n\n-1.5\n\n0.0\n\nprepared in air [393]\nSr0.1La0.9TiO3-?\nSr0.3La0.7TiO3-?\n\ndense ceramics [464]\nSr0.4La0.4TiO3-?\nSr0.8Ti0.6Nb0.4O3-?\nSr0.925Ti0.85Nb0.15O3-?\n\nporous ceramics [464]\nSr0.4La0.4TiO3-?\nSr0.8Ti0.6Nb0.4O3-?\nSr0.925Ti0.85Nb0.15O3-?\n\nprepared in H2-Ar [393]\nSr0.1La0.9TiO3-?\nSr0.3La0.7TiO3-?\n\n1203 K\n\nprepared in air,\npre-reduced\n\n-1/6\n\n-1/4\n\n1273 K\n\n-1/4\n\n-1/6\n\nA\n\nB\n\n \n\nFig. 1.5.4.

Total conductivity \n\n \n\nDepending on the composition, structural or microstructural characteristics, preparation conditions \n\nand measurement procedure, titanate materials may exhibit dielectric, semiconducting, metallic-like, \n\nsuperconducting or ferroelectric properties [453-456]. The present consideration will be restricted primarily \n\nby the behaviour in the high-temperature interval. \n\nIn cubic perovskite lattice, Ti atom is located in the octahedral environment with oxygen. This \n\nresults in splitting of the orbitals in 3d-level of Ti into eg and t2g sublevels, while 2p orbitals from oxygen \n\nsplit into high-energy 2p(?) and low-energy 2p(?) levels. The overlap between 3eg and 2p(?) as well as \n\nbetween 3t2g and 2p(?) orbitals causes formation of ?- and ?-like bands in the electronic structure of the \n\ntitanates. The electrons of alkali earth metals occupy preferentially low-energy bands, since the bands \n\nassociated with the corresponding cations are characterized by significantly higher energies [457, 458]. Such \n\nelectron structure of the titanate-based compositions ensures location of Fermi level between the completely \n\noccupied bonding P? band and shallow ?*(t2g) band. The bandgap of \u201cideal\u201d SrTiO3-? is as large as 3.1 - 3.8 \n\neV which ensures the insulating nature of the material [458, 459]. On the other hand, reduction of Ti induced \n\nby formation of oxygen vacancies or introduction of donor cations results in a partial occupation of the \n\n?*(t2g) conduction band with electrons and appearance of band-type conduction mechanism which is \n\nespecially pronounced under reducing conditions. The electron mobilities are proportional to T-M, where M \n\nvaries from 2.7 at room temperature down to 1.5 - 2 at 1000 K [381, 457, 460]. \n\n\n\n76 \n\n \n\nVariations in the charge carrier concentration or band structure may induce changes in the effective \n\nmass of the electrons and partial localization of the electrons ensuring large polaron or small polaron \n\nconduction mechanism, while the electron transport changes from the metallic-like to semiconducting \n\nbehavior. One should note that the Arrhenius-like behavior, typical for semiconductors and observable on \n\ntitanates under oxidizing conditions might also be associated with temperature-induced minor oxygen losses \n\nleading to generation of additional electrons. Whatever the mechanism of the charge carrier formation and \n\ntheir transport, the conductivity of undoped or donor-doped ATiO3-? (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) under reducing \n\nconditions may exceed 100 - 1000 S/cm and slightly increases on cooling, beneficial for the IT-SOFC \n\napplications. Kinetic limitations may induce deviations between the experimental results and theoretically \n\npredicted dependencies; selected examples are presented in Fig. 1.5.4. Such a behavior complicates \n\ncomparison of the literature data and only outlines the basic trends typical for titanates. \n\nIn accordance with the defect model, in the high-p(O2) range, titanate-based materials are \n\ncharacterized by p-type electronic conduction, attributable to the formation of cation vacancies and \n\nequivalent generation of electron holes. One should note that the appearance of the p-type conductivity \n\nbranch in oxidizing atmospheres with the same slope has been observed on doped ZrO2, HfO2 and related \n\ncompositions [26, 461, 462]. \n\nThe intrinsic conductivity in \u201cpure\u201d ATiO3-? (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) in the region of p-n transition is \n\nnegligible due to the low concentration of charge carriers. In practice, however, the materials are strongly \n\nsusceptible to the presence of impurities, self-disordering and other factors which induce the excitation of \n\ncharges. This results in huge discrepancies between the experimental data, much more pronounced in \n\ncomparison with LaCrO3-?, LaMnO3-? and other p-type conductors, possessing non-negligible levels of \n\nintrinsic charge carriers without intentional doping. Another consequence of the low concentration of the \n\ncharge carriers in titanates relates to a strong effect of minor (1 - 2 mol.%) quantities of acceptor- or donor-\n\ntype dopants on the level of the total conductivity and the transport mechanism, as shown in Fig. 1.5.5. \n\nConsistently with the relationships presented in the defect model, donor-doped titanates exhibit the \n\nn-type conductivity in a wide p(O2) range. Upon reduction, the interval characterized by the slope of the \n\nconductivity vs. p(O2) in the logarithmic scale equal to -1/4 transforms into the region where the conductivity \n\nweakly depends on p(O2) followed by the domain with the slope of -1/6. As expected from the model, the \n\nintermediate-p(O2) region, where a weak influence of the oxygen pressure on the conductivity is observed, \n\nexpands on donor-doping (Fig. 1.5.5). The concentration of mobile charge carriers in the intermediate p(O2) \n\nrange is suggested to be temperature-independent [381, 460]. \n\nAs follows from the defect model, in the low-p(O2) region the conductivity should be independent of \n\nthe donor content under fixed p(O2), and the p(O2)-dependencies of the conductivity for titanates with various \n\ndopant level should converge into a single line (Fig. 1.5.2). This behavior cannot be verified due to the lack \n\nof experimental data in extremely reducing atmospheres, where such a regime should be realized. In \n\noxidizing and moderately reducing conditions, the presence of donor-like dopants increases the fraction of \n\nthe electrons in the conduction band, shifts the Fermi level and causes the appearance of additional levels in \n\nthe bandgap facilitating the electron transitions [105, 381, 406, 412, 414, 460]. \n\n \n\n\n\n77 \n\n \n\n-20 -15 -10 -5 0\n\nlog p(O2) (atm)\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n-3.0\n\n-1.5\n\n0.0\n\n1.5\n\nlo\ng \n\n?\n (\n\nS\n/c\n\nm\n)\n\nSrTiO3-?

Isothermal dependencies of the total \nconductivity vs. p(O2) of selected titanates with donor-\ntype dopants in A- or B-sublattice \n\n \n \n \nIn this respect, the maximum effect is observed on doping with Nb cations, since the orbitals of 4d \n\nlevel of Nb have comparable energies to those of 3d level of Ti, which ensures a contribution of Nb species \n\ninto the electron transfer, improves the overlapping between Ti 3d and O 2p orbitals and induces more \n\nsignificant modifications in the band structure, in particular shifts the conduction band towards lower \n\nenergies [406, 407, 413]. Ru-doping has also been shown to improve the electron transport, possibly due to \n\ndonation of an electron from Ru4+ to generate Ti3+ (Fig. 1.5.6) [463]. \n\nAccording to the defect model of titanates doped with irreducible acceptor-type cations, the p-n \n\ntransition should be shifted towards reducing conditions, while in the oxidative domain a region of p(O2)-\n\nindependent electronic conductivity should appear on the high-p(O2) branch. In practice such a behavior is \n\ngenerally obscured by slow equilibration and dominating oxygen ionic conductivity which may exceed 80 - \n\n90% of the total one. As a result, such materials exhibit an extended (~10 orders of p(O2)) domain where the \n\ntotal conductivity is preserved on nearly constant low level (10-4 - 10-2 S/cm) (Fig. 1.5.7). The effect of \n\nacceptor content on the magnitude of the electronic conductivity may be multiple; as a general rule, the p-n \n\ntransition shifts to lower p(O2) upon doping, while replacement of Ti with inert cations above a definite level \n\nhampers the electron mobility due to a smaller degree of overlapping between Ti 3d and O 2p orbitals. \n\n\n\n78 \n\n \n\n-20 -15 -10 -5 0\n\nlog p(O2) (atm)\n\n-5.0\n\n-4.0\n\n-3.0\n\n-2.0\n\n-1.0\n\n-4.5\n\n-3.0\n\n-1.5\n\n0.0\n\n1.5\n\nlo\ng \n\n?\n (\n\nS\n/c\n\nm\n)\n\nCaTi0.9Sc0.1O3-?

As shown in Fig. \n\n1.5.8, the compositions exhibit a definite p-n transition, possibly due to faster equilibration or larger \n\nelectronic transference numbers, whereas the behavior in the p- and n-conductivity branches depends on the \n\nnature and content of the dopant cation [155, 159, 372, 427, 428, 441, 443, 444]. The conductivity of \n\nA(Ti,B)O3-? (A = Ca, Sr, Ba, B = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) in the low p(O2) range is within 1 - 5 S/cm, but \n\nmay be substantially increased by simultaneous donor-doping (Fig. 1.5.9.). In particular, Ga-, Mn-, Fe- or \n\nCo-doped (Sr,Y)TiO3-? or (Sr,La)TiO3-? are considered as promising materials for low-p(O2) applications, due \n\nto acceptable (up to 100 S/cm) electronic conductivity and sufficient tolerance towards moderate oxidation \n\n[247, 248, 335, 427]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n-20 -15 -10 -5 0\n\n-3.0\n\n-1.8\n\n-0.6\n\n0.6\n\n1.8\n\n-3.2\n\n-1.6\n\n0.0\n\n1.6\n\nlo\ng \n\n?\n (\n\nS\n/c\n\nm\n)\n\n-1.2\n\n-0.4\n\n0.4\n\n1.2\n\n2.0\n\n-20 -18 -16 -14\n\nlog p(O2) (atm)\n\nprepared in H2\nSr0.88Y0.08Ti0.95Cr0.05O3-?

Isothermal dependencies of the total conductivity vs. p(O2) of selected (A,Ln)TiO3-?-based \ncompositions substituted with acceptor-type dopants with variable oxidation state \n\n \n \n\n\n\n80 \n\n \n\nThe transport properties of titanate-based ceramics are substantially governed by microstructural \n\ncharacteristics, essentially pronounced at reduced temperatures. As can be inferred from literature data, the \n\nconductivity behavior for single crystal, film or ceramic materials with various grain size may be quite \n\ndifferent [248, 380, 381, 465-467]; selected examples are shown in Fig. 1.5.5. One of the most common \n\norigins of the complex behavior is a non-uniform cation or defect distribution over the grain, such as an \n\nenrichment of the grain surface with Ti or acceptor-type dopants [451, 468, 469]. Slow oxygen diffusion \n\ninto/out of the bulk phase on redox cycling also causes compositional differences over the grain, varying with \n\ntime [247, 377]. Accumulation of immobile charges at the boundaries results in non-uniform distribution of \n\nelectrons, holes or oxygen vacancies over the grain, deformation of the valence and conduction band with \n\nsubsequent changes in their occupation with electrons and in the width of the bandgap [468, 470-472]. The \n\nfactors indicated significantly affect the resistive properties of the grain exterior layers, while their large \n\ncapacitance may cause trapping of the mobile charge carriers [384, 468, 473]. In particular, the conductivity \n\nof Ni-doped SrTiO3-? within a layer of the thickness of 30 - 200 nm at the grain interface was found to be 4 \n\norders lower compared with that in the bulk phase. Apart from the non-uniform cation distribution, formation \n\nof defect clusters [413, 474, 475] and phase separation at the grain boundaries were reported [371, 409, 413]. \n\nOne should note that the grain surface-related limitations are typical for most mixed ionic/n-type conductors \n\n[30, 72, 476-478] and their effect reduces at elevated temperatures. More details on the grain boundary \n\ncontribution into the electronic transport in titanates may be found in [380, 451, 468, 471, 479, 480] and \n\nreferences cited. \n\n \n \n\n1.5.4. Oxygen ionic and protonic conductivity: selected examples \n\n \nDue to complex defect chemistry of titanates and multiple transitions of the compensation \n\nmechanism, the chemical diffusion coefficient is strongly affected by changes in the concentration of p-, n-, \n\nOV\nii  and other charge carriers on variations of p(O2) or temperature, with resultant influence on the \n\nenhancement factor. In particular, in the region of p-n transition, the ionic conductivity becomes comparable \n\nor even higher than the electronic contribution (Table 1.5.1), while the ambipolar diffusion becomes limited \n\nby both ionic and electronic transport. Such a behavior is different from that of chromites and manganites, \n\nwhere the electronic transference number are close to unity in the entire p(O2) range. Basically, in the region \n\nof p-type conductivity, the chemical diffusion in titanates increases on reduction, exhibiting a maximum \n\nwithin the p-n transition region. Subsequent decrease in p(O2) reduces the diffusivity due to lowering the \n\nenhancement factor, while in the low-p(O2) range, the behavior is more scattered [492-494]. Such a complex \n\nbehavior of the diffusion coefficients yields large discrepancies between experimental data which achieve 2-3 \n\norders of magnitude (Tables 1.5.2 - 1.5.3). In combination with incomplete equilibration and grain boundary-\n\nrelated effects, the ionic transport becomes strongly influenced by preparation conditions, measurement \n\nprocedure or the microstructure of the sample. Moreover, large variety of the experimental techniques and \n\ntesting conditions complicates a direct comparison of the data on diffusion in titanates with those obtained for \n\nother perovskite groups. \n\n\n\n81 \n\n \n\nTable 1.5.1.

One should note \n\nintroduction of Ln cations into (A,Ln)TiO3-? may be accompanied by equivalent introduction of cation \n\nvacancies which might also be responsible for smaller diffusion coefficients and larger activation energies \n\nobserved [377, 496-498]. \n\nObviously, the ionic conductivity should be promoted by the presence of acceptor-type cations in B-\n\nsublattice, with fixed or variable oxidation state [412, 428, 434, 441, 495, 499-501]. The effect of acceptor \n\ndoping originates from lowering average oxidation state of B-site cations, weaker B-O bonds and more \n\nflexible oxygen coordination around cations in B-sublattice which facilitates formation of oxygen vacancies. \n\nGenerally, the oxygen diffusivity proportionally increases with the dopant amount up to a definite \n\nlevel, while further doping induces the separation of secondary phases, structural transformations, defect \n\ninteractions and formation of vacancy-ordered superstructures; two latter phenomena are especially \n\npronounced for titanates enriched with Fe, Co, Ni or cations with the oxidation state lower than +3 [428, 434, \n\n436, 439, 441, 499, 501-503]. In accordance with calculations [441], the maximum oxygen diffusivity is \n\nexpected for titanates doped with 20% of Fe; this doping level was confirmed by experimental data [441, \n\n503, 504]. Co-introduction of donor- and acceptor-type dopants into titanates has 2 opposite effects on the \n\noxygen deficiency and ionic transport [427, 448, 501]; on the other hand, the presence of Ln-cations in A-\n\nsublattice improves the stability and suppresses the vacancy ordering [501]. \n\n\n\n83 \n\n \n\nTable 1.5.3.

This might be associated with wide \n\nuncertainties in the determination of the surface kinetics-related parameters due to dominant limitations by \n\nthe bulk diffusion [247, 377, 492, 497, 505]. Ti atoms located at the surface significantly differ from those in \n\nthe bulk phase in terms of crystal symmetry, oxygen coordination, strength of B-O bonds etc., which ensures \n\nfaster rates of the surface processes [506, 507]. Selected experimental results presented in Tables 1.5.2 - 1.5.3 \n\nand the equilibration behavior of titanates discussed earlier confirm accelerated rates of the oxygen exchange. \n\nSubstitution of transition metal cations for titanium increases the contribution of the surface limitations \n\nwhich become essentially pronounced at elevated temperatures [439, 499, 508] due to more substantial \n\nimprovement of the bulk ionic transport in comparison with the surface exchange. \n\nFinally, one should briefly consider a possible contribution of the protonic conduction into the \n\noverall ionic transport in titanates. The proton transport in most perovskites proceeds via so-called Grotthus \n\nmechanism which involves hopping of proton species from OH- groups located in the oxygen sites of the \n\nperovskite lattice to neighboring oxygen atoms ([514, 515] and references cited). Nevertheless, the nature of \n\nthe protonic charge carriers in titanate-based perovskites is arguable. In particular, temperature- and p(O2)-\n\ndependent behavior of the electromotive force (e.m.f) across a titanate-based membrane was attributed to \n\nmigration of hydride species (H-) or associates of neutral hydrogen atoms or protons with electrons [514]. \n\nAlthough such a possibility was predicted from molecular dynamic simulations [516], formation of \n\nsubstantial amounts of hydride ions may be achieved only at extremely low p(O2) (<10\n-20 atm), located \n\nbeyond testing conditions. Moreover, most cations, in particular Ti4+, cannot coexist with hydride species \n\nwhich may cause decomposition of the perovskite phase [517]. More reliable seems the assumption of \n\nparticipation of OH- groups in the protonic transfer mechanism. Generation of \nOOH\ni  species in the oxygen \n\nsublattice proceeds in accordance with the process [502, 514, 515]: \n\n2 O O O\nH O V O 2OH\n\n\u00d7\n+ + =\n\nii i\n\n  (Eq. 1.5.7) \n\n \nThe protonic conductivity of an acceptor-doped titanate may be formulated as \n\n( )\n\n2\n\n2\n1 2 1 2 2 2\n\nH Ti H OA[ ] (1/ )\nw mw\n\nH HS\n\nR RTp T e e?\n\n? ? + ??\n\n??   (Eq. 1.5.8) \n\n \nAs follows from Eq. (1.5.8),  the protonic diffusion is determined by proton migration enthalpy ?Hm and \n\nsolubility of water in the perovskite structure. Since the enthalpy of the hydration process ?Hw is negative, \n\nthe term (?Hw + 2?Hm) may adopt both positive and negative value; in the latter case, the protonic \n\nconduction should decrease on heating. \n\nLocalization of protons on oxygen sites is considered to promote the transfer of \nOOH\ni  species due to \n\ntheir smaller charge and ionic radius in comparison with \nOO\n\u00d7 . On the other hand, formation of \n\nOOH\ni  groups \n\ninduces lattice deformations, i.e. elongation of Ti-OH bonds and reduction of O-OH bonds in comparison \n\nwith proton-free perovskite structure which causes additional stresses contributing into the overall activation \n\nenergy of the protonic migration [518-520]. As shown by molecular dynamic simulations [518], CaTiO3-?- \n\nand SrTiO3-?-based perovskites support both the mechanism of the protonic hopping between two adjacent \n\n\n\n85 \n\n \n\noxygen atom within the same octahedron (intra-octahedral mechanism) and the mechanism involving \n\nparticipation of next-nearest neighboring O positions (inter-octahedral mechanism). \n\nRegardless of the specific mechanism of the migration, the protonic conductivity in titanates is \n\nrather low (10-5 - 10-4 at 873 - 1073 K, as can be observed from Table 1.5.4), which is primarily associated \n\nwith low water solubility in titanates (<1 mol.% [521]). \n\n \n\nTable 1.5.4.

In this respect, the expansion behavior of doped \n\ntitanates is less obvious in comparison with the perovskites enriched with easily reducible cations. For \n\nexample, no obvious compositional dependence of the thermally-induced strains was detected for Sr1-\n\nxLaxTiO3-? series [105]. Generation of A-site cation vacancies basically results in lower TECs [420, 527] due \n\nto hindered oxygen losses or suppressed formation of RP-phases (Table 1.5.5). \n\nOn the other hand, a decrease in TEC on Ln doping is well pronounced for transition metal-\n\nsubstituted titanates, where the electronic compensation of the variations in cation composition may be \n\nrealized [501]. Introduction of reducible cations generally increases the thermally-induced strains; such a \n\nbehavior is consistent with lower TECs of Ti-substituted ferrites, manganites, cobaltites, etc. and is primarily \n\nassociated with the contribution of the oxygen losses into the overall dimensional changes [438, 501, 528]. \n\nLarger ionic radius of Ti3+ compared with that of Ti4+ (0.67 vs 0.605 \u00c5 in 6-fold coordination [133]) \n\nis expected to enlarge the cell volume with oxygen losses on reduction. Indeed, an enhancement of the cell \n\nparameters of the perovskite phase upon reduction has been observed on numerous titanate-based \n\n\n\n87 \n\n \n\ncompositions [16, 377, 414, 422]. On the other hand, similar to manganite perovskites, formation of cation \n\nvacancies induced by oxidation may generate additional unit cells with resultant increasing of the total \n\nvolume [529, 533]. Furthermore, the thermomechanical behavior of ATiO3-?-based systems is in most cases \n\ninterfered by slow equilibration, formation or dissolution of secondary phases on redox cycling, while \n\naccumulation of stresses in the perovskite lattice may provoke formation and propagation of cracks. These \n\nfactors lead to large discrepancies between the experimental results which obscure the comparison of the \n\nliterature data. Therefore, no unambiguous correlation between the defect equilibria and chemical expansion \n\nbehavior has been found [70, 527, 529, 533]. \n\nFor pre-oxidized samples, the volume changes generally occur towards a slight expansion on \n\ndecreasing p(O2) due to an enlargement of Ti cations upon reduction, although densification of initially \n\nporous specimens as well as kinetics or secondary phase-related factors may result in a slight shrinkage, as \n\nshown in Table 1.5.6. The linear expansivity of air-sintered (Sr,Ln)TiO3-? on reduction is generally within \n\n0.02 - 0.03% [105, 527, 529], while the presence of reducible cations basically induces more substantial \n\ndimensional variations [16, 531]; in the latter case, the thermomechanical behaviour is determined by the \n\nreducibility of the corresponding cations. \n\n \nTable 1.5.6.

The origins of \n\n\n\n88 \n\n \n\nsuch a behaviour may be complex and are associated with a slow re-distribution of the defects in the \n\nperovskite structure which may delay from fast p(O2) variations, cracking or contribution of secondary \n\nphases/ordered domains at high p(O2) into the volume changes. In accordance with large variations in the \n\noxygen nonstoichiometry, pre-reduced titanates doped with donor-like Ln or Nb cations show larger volume \n\nchanges, at least in terms of the cell parameters [407, 464, 529]. \n\nAs discussed in previous sections, a preliminary step of high-temperature reduction is generally \n\nrequired in order to improve the transport and electrocatalytic properties of titanates. Therefore, any \n\noxidation of preliminary reduced anode material should be avoided; in particular, p(O2) changes in the range \n\n~10-16 - 10-10 atm induce ~0.5% linear strain of pre-reduced Sr0.7La0.3TiO3-?, unacceptable for the \n\nelectrochemical applications [533]. \n\n \n \n\n1.5.6. Electrochemical properties \n\n \nAnalogously with other perovskite-based anodes, the electrochemical performance of titanates is \n\nstrongly influenced by preparation and testing conditions. Apart from the common origins of the \n\ndiscrepancies, for the present system the behavior is complicated by the slow equilibration kinetics, and a \n\ncomparison of results obtained for different titanate-based anodes in various studies is in most cases \n\nunreasonable. \n\nSelected results on the electrochemical behaviour of titanate-based anodes and related composites \n\nare shown in Figs. 1.5.10 - 1.5.12 and Table 1.5.7. Despite the high electronic conductivity of ATiO3-?-based \n\nperovskites under low-p(O2) conditions (above 100 - 1000 S/cm) reported in numerous studies [13, 105, 406, \n\n460], most titanate anodes are coated with Pt, Au or other metallic paste. Comparing the level of the \n\npolarization resistances obtained for the covered anodes with a few data for uncoated ones, one may conclude \n\nthat such a modification indeed results in a strong improvement of the electrochemical performance, \n\nprimarily due to a promotion of elementary steps involved in the oxidation process [7, 388, 416, 536]. \n\n \n\n0.85 0.90 0.95 1.00 1.05 1.10\n\n103/T, K-1\n\n0.0\n\n1.2\n\n2.4\n\n3.6\n\nlo\ng \n\nR\n?\n (\n\nO\nhm\n\n<\ncm\n\n2\n)\n\nfuel: wet H\n2\n; c.c.: Au paste\n\nLa0.4Sr0.6Mn0.6Ti0.4O3-?

Polarization resistance of selected titanate-based composite anodes deposited onto YSZ \n\nelectrolyte \n \n\n \n\nAs a confirmation of the small effect of the electronic conductivity on the electrochemical \n\nperformance, highly-conductive donor-doped titanates show extremely poor performances [215, 411, 537], in \n\naccordance with lowering the oxygen ionic conduction on increasing dopant amount [407, 450, 501]. \n\nMoreover, the characteristics of such electrodes are strongly related with the conditions of the electrode \n\nprocessing. In particular, individual anodes Sr0.94Ti0.9Nb0.1O3-? deposited onto YSZ and covered with Pt paste, \n\nshowed polarization resistance in the range 0.5 - 160 Ohm\u00d7cm2 at 1123 K, depending on the sequence of \n\nreduction or oxidation runs [411, 538]. \n\nThe anode characteristics can be improved by fabrication of composite anodes (Fig. 1.5.11, Table \n\n1.5.7). For example, the anode Sr0.88Y0.08TiO3-? - Ce0.5La0.5O2-? (50 - 50 wt.%) deposited onto LSGM \n\nelectrolyte with Ce0.5La0.5O2-? buffer layer showed the power density in dry H2 at 1123 K as high as 450 \n\nmW/cm2, which might be enhanced up to 1000 mW/cm2 by Pd impregnation into the anode, in accordance \n\nwith improved catalytic activity [539]. Composite anodes (Sr,La)TiO3-? - YSZ (50-50 wt.%) covered with Au \n\npaste rendered the polarization resistances in the range 0.9 - 1.3 and 2.0 - 2.5 Ohm\u00d7cm2 at 1173 K in wet H2 \n\nand CH4, respectively. Power densities observable on cells with the corresponding anodes were as high as \n\n100 - 120 mW/cm2 at 1173 K with pure hydrogen as fuel; the major performance losses were associated with \n\na large electrolyte thickness (2 mm). Although the results obtained for anode compositions with various \n\ndoping level were scattered, somewhat better results were obtained for 25 - 29% of La [416]. This amount of \n\ndonor atoms was shown to be acceptable to ensure a high level of the electronic conduction, while further La-\n\ndoping might induce formation of ordered domains and hamper the ionic conduction. \n\n\n\n91 \n\n \n\nNevertheless, most studies have been carried out with derivatives of Sr0.67La0.33TiO3-?, containing a \n\nlarger amount of donor cations (Figs. 1.5.11 - 1.5.12). Such a choice was related with the necessity to \n\nsuppress the decrease in the concentration of n-type charge carriers induced by introduction of acceptor \n\ncations; on the other hand, the presence of low-valent cations ensured a better structural tolerance towards La \n\nintroduction and provided an enhanced level of the ionic conduction. Quite promising results were obtained \n\nfor Mn-doped Sr0.67La0.33TiO3-?-based anodes, yielding the polarization resistance as low as 0.45 and 1.2 \n\nOhm\u00d7cm2 at 1173 K in wet H2 and wet CH4 fuels, although the information on the anode processing is scarce \n\n[12].

Polarization curves of selected titanate-based anodes \n \n \nA positive impact of Fe-doping into Sr0.67La0.33TiO3-? on the anode characteristics has been reported \n\n[542, 543]; the optimum performance was found for ~50% of Fe. The polarization resistance of composite \n\nanodes varied in the range 1 - 2 Ohm\u00d7cm2 at 1173 K in wet hydrogen; more promising results were obtained \n\nfor Sr0.92Y0.08Ti0.75Fe0.25O3-?-based anodes (0.7 Ohm\u00d7cm\n2 at 1073 K) [528]. Acceptable electrode activity was \n\nachieved upon doping with Sc [447], Co [536], Ni [544], consistently with larger amount of oxygen \n\nvacancies, higher ionic conductivity and/or catalytic activity towards fuel oxidation processes. Introduction \n\nof Cr possessing a low catalytic activity caused large polarization resistances [163, 212, 538] (Fig. 1.5.12). \n\nIn accordance with transport and thermomechanical properties, the electrochemical activity of \n\ntitanate anodes may be improved by preliminary high-temperature reduction [13, 105, 464]. Unfortunately, \n\nno literature data on comparative behaviour of preliminary reduced vs. oxidized anode layers are available, \n\n\n\n92 \n\n \n\nprimarily due to peculiarities of the procedure of the cell preparation and operation. In this respect, one may \n\nnote studies on cone-shaped Sr0.94Ti0.9Nb0.1O3-? anode on polarization cycling, where preliminary cathodic \n\npolarization accelerates the subsequent electrode processes and reduce the polarization resistance [411]. \n\nSimilar to the transport and thermomechanical behaviour, most titanate-based electrodes showed a specific \n\nfeature, associated with fast and in some cases irreversible performance deterioration observable on \n\noxidation. For example, the composite anode Sr0.94Ti0.9Nb0.1O3-? - YSZ showed a 2-fold increase in the \n\npolarization resistance after exposures to high p(O2) and subsequent switch to H2 [411]. Sr0.895Y0.07TiO3-? - \n\nYSZ - Ni anode showed a satisfactory tolerance towards cycling between H2, N2 and air at 1073 K, while a \n\nsimilar procedure at 973 K induced a 35% loss in the power density after 200 cycles [452]. On the other \n\nhand, Ni-cermet anode with Sr0.8La0.2TiO3-?-based support was shown to be capable to endure at least 5 \n\ncycles dry H2 - air, without degradation of the performance; considering a poor tolerance of Ni-based anodes \n\ntowards oxidation, the presence of titanate layer seems beneficial [545]. \n\nTitanate-based electrodes are characterized by a satisfactory chemical compatibility with YSZ \n\nelectrolyte, although the stability may be deteriorated by Ti diffusion into the electrolyte. No reaction \n\nproducts between (Sr,Ln)TiO3-? and YSZ could be observed up to 1623 - 1823 K [247, 377, 416, 537]. The \n\npresence of transition metal cations, such as Fe, in the perovskite structure significantly affects the \n\ncompatibility [501, 528, 531]: in particular, interaction of SrTi1-xFexO3-? with YSZ was detected at \n\ntemperatures above 1273 K, irrespective to Ti:Fe ratio [501]. On the other hand, the interaction may be \n\nsuppressed by appropriate doping with Ln cations or introduction of A-site cation vacancies [407, 420, 501]. \n\nIn contrast, studies by Burnat et al. showed a worse compatibility of Sr0.7La0.2TiO3-? in comparison with the \n\nstoichiometric analogue [546]. Incorporation of Ti into the zirconia lattice is detrimental for the ionic \n\ntransport ([89, 103] and references cited) which necessitates a search of the optimum cation ratio in the \n\nperovskite composition in order to expand the temperature range acceptable for the electrode preparation. \n\nPromising results were obtained for Sr0.94Ti0.9Nb0.1O3-?, chemically compatible with YSZ in air and 9% H2 - \n\nAr at 1523 K [411]. No secondary phase formation between Sr0.7La0.2TiO3-? in contact with CGO10 was \n\ndetected at 1573 - 1673 K [546].  \n\nSummarizing the behaviour of titanate-based electrodes, one may note that addition of titanates in \n\nappropriate proportions to ionic conducting and/or catalytically active components significantly widens the \n\napplicability of the related electrochemical cells. The main concern, however, remains the low tolerance \n\ntowards oxidizing atmospheres leading to strong and irreversible changes in the anode microstructure, \n\ndegradation of the functional characteristics of the electrode constituents, etc.  \n\n \n \n1.6. Molybdate-based double perovskites as alternative anode materials \n\n \nConsidering the stability under reducing conditions, the choice of potential anode materials may be \n\nextended to other perovskite-related structural groups. A remarkable success in terms of electrochemical \n\napplications has been achieved with doped molybdates A2(Mo,B)2O6-? (A = Ca, Sr, Ba, B = Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, \n\nNi) ordered in B-sublattice due to large differences between the charges and/or sizes of molybdenum and \n\n\n\n93 \n\n \n\nsubstituent cation. Formation of oxygen-deficient perovskite-like structure becomes possible due to \n\ncoexistence of highly-valent Mo species ensuring the conservation of oxygen sublattice and the cations in \n\nlow oxidation states capable to adopt multiple oxygen coordination which stabilizes oxygen vacancies. The \n\nability of Mo to accept electrons and form low-coordinated molybdyl ions is also beneficial for providing the \n\nelectronic and ionic conductivity [1, 129, 551]. Reasonable activity of Mo-containing compounds towards \n\nreforming processes [552-554] is expected to promote the performance of molybdate anodes in natural fuels. \n\n \n\n \nTable 6.1.

The presence of the secondary phases is undesirable for the electrochemical applications and \n\npreliminary reduction step is required in order to achieve an acceptable electronic conductivity. Selected \n\nfunctional properties of molybdate-based double perovskites are shown in Table 6.1. The conductivity of the \n\ndouble perovskite Sr2MgMoO6-? and its derivatives after reduction varies in the range 5 - 10 S/cm which is \n\nclose to the limit acceptable for anode applications, while the material shows reasonable chemical and \n\nstructural stability and tolerance of the functional characteristics towards moderate oxidation [129, 556, 557].  \n\n\n\n94 \n\n \n\nPre-reduction of Sr2MgMoO6-? and subsequent annealing in air during the process of the preparation \n\nof electrode layers enables to obtain anodes with promising level of the electrochemical activity [126, 129]; \n\nin particular, the polarization resistances in the range 0.2 - 1 Ohm\u00d7cm2 were observed, as shown in Table 6.2.  \n\nThe power density of cells with Sr2MgMoO6-? anode (coated with Pt paste) and LSGM electrolyte of 300 \u00b5 m \n\nof the thickness separated with CeO2-based sublayer achieves 840 mW/cm\n2 at 1073 K in dry H2 [126]. The \n\nperformance remains on a constant level on introduction of 5 ppm H2S and shows only a 2.5% drop after 50 \n\ncycles (Fig. 6.1). An advantage of molybdate-based anodes is high performance in hydrocarbon fuels \n\namounting to 440 and 350 mW/cm2 at 1073 K in dry CH4 and 97% CH4 - 3% H2O, respectively [126, 129]. \n\nAn improvement of the performance with La doping up to 40% was reported, possibly due to generation of \n\nadditional n-type charge carriers [557]. The power density drop after 50 operation cycles in CH4-containing \n\nfuel achieves 10 - 15% [126, 557]. \n\nApplication of Sr2MgMoO6-?-based materials imposes stringent requirements on the operation \n\nconditions, primarily due to formation of SrMoO4 on oxidation. On the other hand, reduction at temperatures \n\nabove 1173 K is accompanied by decomposition into Sr3Mo2O7-based phase, MgO and Mo [555]. High \n\ncontent of alkali-earth cations in both sublattices makes the material susceptible towards the presence of H2O, \n\nCO2, SOx in fuel atmosphere, while the presence of molybdenum induces volatilization or surface-diffusion \n\nphenomena ([14, 80, 266] and references cited). Another concern relates to insufficient chemical \n\ncompatibility of Sr2MgMoO6-? with solid electrolytes which necessitates introducing buffer layers [129, 556]. \n\n \n\n \n\n0 15 30 45\n\ncycle number\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\nP\nm\n\nax\n, m\n\nW\n/c\n\nm\n2 480\n\n600\n\n720\n\n840\n\nfuel: H\n2\n\nSr2NiMoO6-?

In particular, for A2FeMoO6-? double \n\nperovskites, decreasing A-site cation radius promotes delocalization of electrons in 2p, 3d and 4d bands of \n\noxygen, iron and molybdenum. This, in particular, leads to increasing conductivity in the order Ba2FeMoO6-\n\n?<Sr2FeMoO6-?<Ca2FeMoO6-? and transition from small polaron to metallic-type behavior [560]. \n\nOn the other hand, the degree of the ordering and the stability is lower for smaller A-site cations; for \n\nexample, Ca2FeMoO6-? synthesized in H2 - Ar atmospheres shows a substantial decomposition into the \n\nbrownmillerite phase and CaMoO4 on placing into N2 environments [560]. Introduction of transition metal \n\ncations other than Fe into B-sublattice was shown to be less beneficial, primarily due to poor stability. In \n\nparticular, Sr2CoMoO6-? and Sr2NiMoO6-? showed decomposition in 5% H2 - Ar at 1073 K [562], although \n\nthe formation of metallic phases might promote the oxidation processes. \n\nA promising electrode activity was found for Sr2FeMoO6-?-based anodes, due to the optimum \n\ncombination of oxygen vacancy concentration, stability and expansion behaviour. In particular, the power \n\ndensity of dry H2-fuelled cell achieved 830 mW/cm\n2 at 1123 K, exhibiting the drop of 2.7% per 20 hours \n\n(Fig. 6.1). In commercial city gas contaminated with H2S, the power density shows a decrease per initial 3 \n\n\n\n96 \n\n \n\nhours of operation down to 436 mW/cm2 at 1073 K followed by stable working, without detectable carbon or \n\nsulfur deposition [560]. Nevertheless, the overall performance of Sr2FeMoO6-? anodes is inferior in \n\ncomparison with Mg-substituted analogue. \n\n \n\n1.7. Final remarks. \n\n \n\nIn accordance with literature data on alternative anode materials, most studies have been focused on \n\ntitanates, chromites and manganites. Briefly, their potential for electrochemical applications may be \n\nsummarized as follows.  \n\nTitanates. ATiO3-?-based compositions offer a high level of the electronic conductivity at low p(O2), \n\nmoderate thermal expansion, stability in reducing atmospheres, contribution of the ionic transfer, chemical \n\ncompatibility with solid electrolytes, while titanate-based anodes showed a tolerance towards hydrocarbons \n\nor S-containing gas species. However, the optimum properties of most titanates can only be achieved after \n\npreliminary high-temperature reduction which complicates the procedure of the cell preparation. From this \n\nviewpoint, an oxidation often leads to drastic and irreversible chemical or structural transformations with \n\nresultant deterioration of mechanical and transport characteristics. Similar features are relevant to other n-\n\ntype conductors, such as vanadates, niobates, molybdates, etc. \n\nChromites. LnCrO3-? and their derivatives are notable due to their high stability in a wide p(O2) \n\nrange, reasonable thermal and chemical expansion, suppressed reactivity with commonly used solid \n\nelectrolytes. The perovskite structure enables to accommodate a wide range of dopants which allows to tune \n\nthe functional properties. On the other hand, the low p(O2) drop of the conductivity makes the issue of the \n\nelectronic transfer critical for electrochemical applications, while the low level of oxygen transport and \n\ncatalytic activity necessitates introduction of additional components into the anode. The volatility of Cr-\n\ncontaining species and the tendency towards formation of secondary phases on the surface impose stringent \n\nrequirements on the gas atmosphere composition and the cell processing conditions. \n\nManganites. Manganite perovskites possess a high level of the electronic conductivity, which can be \n\nkinetically conserved even under anodic conditions, especially if the composition is stabilized with an \n\nappropriate dopant. Most authors report an enhanced ionic transport and catalytic activity towards oxidation \n\nprocesses. However, the formation of secondary phases and the conductivity drop under low p(O2) \n\ndeteriorates the electrode performance which, in particular, induces degradation of the long-term \n\nperformance. Manganites exhibit enhanced chemically-induced expansion or contraction; the \n\nthermomechanical behaviour is complicated by formation/consumption of cation and oxygen vacancies for \n\nthe same composition in a wide p(O2) region. Moreover, high cation diffusivity affects the sintering \n\nbehaviour which may cause microstructural problems for the electrode layers. High mobility of Mn and \n\nreduced stability of the perovskite phase promote the interaction/interdiffusion phenomena at the interface \n\nelectrode/electrolyte. Similar peculiarities are typical for Fe- or Co-enriched perovskites. \n\nAs shown by the examples, no alternative anode composition has been elaborated so far capable to \n\ncompete with conventional Ni cermets. On the other hand, an appropriate combination of the positive \n\ncharacteristics relevant to the groups presented may offer a possibility to achieve satisfactory electrode \n\n\n\n97 \n\n \n\nperformance and stability. To some extent, such an approach has been realized by preparation of \n\ncompositions at the joints between the groups i.e. (La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-?, (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-?, (La,Sr)(Cr,Ni)O3-\n\n?, (La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-?, etc. However, the relationships between chemical composition, functional \n\ncharacteristics and anode properties for most materials are unclear, while promising results have been \n\nessentially obtained on composite electrodes, in particular those modified by distribution of metallic phase \n\nover the anode layer. With this respect, it would be attractive to reveal the intrinsic properties of the \n\nperovskite phases responsible for the polarization behaviour of the corresponding electrodes. The present \n\nstudy will thus evaluate selected derivatives of chromites, manganites as well as complex compositions like \n\n(La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-? and (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-? in terms of the structural, microstructural, transport and \n\nthermomechanical characteristics as well as their electrode activity. \n\n \n\n\n\n98 \n\n \n\nChapter 2.

Synthesis of nano-sized CGO20 was carried out by cellulose-precursor \n\ntechnique; the details can be found in [567]. \n\nMost compositions were prepared by the glycine-nitrate process (GNP), a self-sustaining \n\ncombustion technique which enables to produce submicron-sized homogeneous powder with a large surface \n\narea. The method is essentially preferable when the solid state synthesis is stagnated due to kinetic reasons. \n\nThis technique was employed for the synthesis of perovskite-type (La1-xSrx)0.95Mn0.5Cr1-xTixO3-?

Irrespective of the initial products, the \n\naqueous mixture was placed into a beaker with the volume of 1 - 2 L, covered with a steel grid and \n\nevaporated on a hotplate until autoignition. The resultant foam-like powders were annealed at 1073 - 1273 K \n\nfor 2 hours to remove organic impurities. Due to low homogeneity of Ti-containing materials, additional \n\nannealing steps at 1473 - 1573 K with intermediate regrinding in a planetry ball-mill with zirconia balls were \n\nperformed. The series (La1-xSrx)1-yMn0.5Ti0.5O3-? (y = 0 - 0.03) was synthesized using GNP technique in the \n\nInstitute of Solid State Chemistry, Chernogolovka, Russia, by A.I. Ivanov and Dr. S.I. Bredikhin. \n\nSynthesis of SrMn1-xNbxO3-?, CaMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? and La10Si5AlO26.5 was carried out by a standard \n\nceramic technique. The stoichiometric quantities of precursors indicated in Table 2.1 were mixed, placed into \n\nalundum crucibles and heated up to 1073 - 1273 K. Afterwards, the reaction mixture was ground in a ball-\n\nmill and subjected to 3 - 5 additional annealing steps in 1073 - 1573 K temperature range, with 5 - 20 hours \n\ndwell at the target temperature. The processing of LSGM and La10Si5AlO26.5 solid electrolytes is described in \n\nTable 2.2. \n\nThe powders obtained by the techniques described were uniaxially pressed into discs (12 - 20 mm in \n\ndiameter) of various thicknesses. The pellets were sintered in air under conditions indicated in Table 2.1. \n\nHeating and cooling was carried out with the rate 2 - 5 K/min, in order to approach to the complete \n\nequilibrium with the gas atmosphere. In order to access possible effects of the microstructure on the ionic \n\ntransport properties, samples of (La0.35Sr0.65)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.1Ti0.4O3-? were synthesized for 15 or 50 hours. \n\nCeramic pellets for oxygen permeability measurements were subjected to gas-tightness test. This \n\nprocedure involved attaching a disc-shaped sample preliminary polished to the necessary thickness to a \n\nlateral side of 8YSZ tube (13 mm of outer diameter) with glue (Super Cola 3). After drying the glue, the \n\npellet was immersed into water and the inner volume of the tube was exposed to the pressure of ~2 atm. The \n\nquality of the ceramics was checked visually by the absence/presence of air bubbles on the outer surface of \n\nthe pellet. \n\n\n\n9\n9\n\n \n\n  T\na\n\nb\nle\n\n 2\n.1\n\n.

Optionally, the powders were additionally \n\nannealed at 1273 - 1573 K prior to the analysis in order to release gaseous species adsorbed from ambient \n\natmosphere. For dilatometric tests and conductivity or Seebeck coefficient measurements, bar-shaped \n\nspecimens were cut from the pellets using a cut-off machine (Struers) and polished to obtain cuboid-like \n\nsamples which might be placed and equilibrated on either facet on a flat surface. \n\n \n\nX-ray diffraction, Mossbauer spectroscopy \n\n \n\nPhase relationships in intermediate and final products were studied using XRD analysis carried out \n\non powdered samples. XRD patterns were collected in atmospheric air on a series Rigaku D/Max-B X-ray \n\npowder diffractometer. The scans were obtained in Cu-K? radiation (?=0.154178 nm), within 2? range 10 - \n\n80\u00ba. The patterns were collected with scanning rate 3\u00ba /min or with 0.02\u00ba step with exposition time of 1 - 2 \n\nseconds. \n\nIn order to evaluate phase changes occurring in the materials upon temperature variations, ceramic \n\nsamples were quenched from the given temperature into liquid nitrogen. Selected compositions were \n\nannealed in Ar or in wet 10% H2 - N2 flow with subsequent slow cooling (2K/min) or quenching in the \n\ncorresponding gas flow. The oxygen partial pressure in the gas atmosphere was controlled using an oxygen \n\nsensor placed into the same or a separated furnace. In the latter case, the sensor was connected to the reaction \n\ncompartment with gas communication systems, while the values of p(O2) around the sample were calculated \n\nfrom the sensor response corrected for the temperature difference between the corresponding furnaces. \n\nVariations in the crystal structure on heating in situ were examined using high-temperature XRD \n\ntechnique. The measurements, carried out at the North Carolina A&amp;T State University by Dr. S.N. \n\nYarmolenko, were performed with AXS-Bruker D8 Discover diffractometer with Cu K? X-ray radiation \n\nsource and Eurlean cradle. Parallel beam optics was used to minimize errors associated with sample \n\ndisplacement and surface roughness. Anton Paar H-900 high temperature stage mounted on XYZ-positioning \n\nstage was used for measurements at temperatures up to 1173 K. Ceramic samples were polished down to 0.5 \n\nmm thick tablet form for better contact with heater. HTXRD scans were performed in the interval 2? of 20 - \n\n\n\n101 \n\n \n\n80\u00ba with speed 5s/point and step 0.01\u00ba. Calculation of the cell parameters of single- or multiple-phase \n\ncompositions as well as verification of the lattice symmetry was performed using the Fullprof software [568]. \n\nMossbauer transmission studies were carried out in collaboration with Dr. J.C.B. Waerenborgh and \n\nDr. E.V. Tsipis at the Centro de Ci\u00eancias e Tecnologias Nucleares, Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Universidade \n\nde Lisboa. The spectra were acquired at room temperature and 4 K using a conventional constant-\n\nacceleration spectrometer and a 25 mCi 57Co source in Rh matrix. ?-Fe foil was selected for velocity \n\ncalibration. The adsorbers were obtained by pressing the powdered samples into perspex holders. Isomer \n\nshifts are related to metallic ?-Fe at room temperature. The 4 K spectra were collected using a JANIS bath \n\ncryostat (SVT-400), with the sample immersed into liquid He. The spectra were fitted to Lorentzian lines \n\nusing a non-linear least-squares method [569]. The relative areas and line widths of both peaks in a \n\nquadropole doublet and one of the symmetrical peaks constituting a magnetic sextet were constrained to \n\nremain equal. The distribution of magnetic splittings was fitted with the histogram method [570]. \n\n \n\nMicrostructural analysis \n\n \n\nThe microstructural studies of ceramic and powdered samples as well as inspection of the electrode \n\nlayers were performed by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive spectroscopy \n\n(SEM/EDS) on microscopes Hitachi S4100 (Rontec UHV detector, electron beam voltage 25 kV) and SU-70 \n\nEDS (Everhart Thornly Secondary Electron Detectors, accelerating voltage 0.5 - 30 kV). Examination of \n\nceramic materials was carried out on fractured or polished surface; in the latter case, mechanical polishing \n\nwas performed using silicon carbide papers #600-2400 supplied by Struers coated with a small amount of \n\ndiamond paste \u00bc - 9 mkm (Cafro), sequentially decreasing the abrasive roughness. Afterwards, the samples \n\nwere ultrasonically cleaned in ethanol or acetone and thermally etched for 0.1 - 1 hour in order to remove the \n\norganic residues and to visualize the grains. The annealing temperature was selected as 150 - 200 K below \n\nthe sintering temperature. Obtained ceramics was attached to the sample holder using carbon cement (Gocke) \n\nor carbon tape (NEM TAPE). In order to avoid surface charging during microscopic analysis, the samples \n\nwere covered with a thin layer of carbon using evaporating machine EMITECH K950X. \n\nTo observe possible microstructural or compositional changes taking place in the electrode layers \n\nduring the electrochemical tests, the half-cells subjected to the polarization measurements or duplicates \n\nprepared by the corresponding procedure and exposed to the same environments as the cells for the \n\nelectrochemical studies were attached to the holder by such a manner so as to keep the electrode layer on the \n\ntop. Another approach involved breaking the half-cell across the electrode and electrolyte layers, \n\nperpendicular to the interface, and exposure of the fractured surfaces and the boundary between the half-cell \n\ncomponents to the microscopic studies. The latter method allowed to examine the morphology of the \n\nelectrode layer and detect possible interactions, cation interdiffusion, etc. \n\nTEM analysis was carried out at the University of Aveiro under the supervision of Dr. A.L.B. Lopes \n\nwith a Hitachi H-9000 microscope (electron beam energy 300 kV). Additional experiments were made at the \n\nNorth Carolina A&amp;T State University by Dr. S.N. Yarmolenko using the microscope Hitachi-H600AB (100 \n\nkEv). The procedure of preparation of submicron powdered samples involved their deposition onto copper or \n\n\n\n102 \n\n \n\ncarbon grid holders from ultrasonically-dispersed suspension in ethanol followed by drying and deposition of \n\ncarbon. The microstructural studies were combined with EDS analysis to control the elemental composition \n\nof the regions examined. \n\n \n\nThermal analysis \n\n \n\nDilatometric studies were performed on rectangular bar samples in a vertical dilatometer Linseis \n\nL75/N1. Calibration of the dilatometer was carried out on Al2O3 bar subjected to the same measurement \n\nprocedure as the samples studied. Depending on the gas atmosphere and kinetics of equilibration of the \n\nmaterial, the data were collected in two regimes. The 1st included continuous heating up to 1373 K and \n\nimmediate cooling with the rate of 3 K/min down to the ambient temperature; such a procedure was \n\nessentially employed during measurements in flowing air. The 2nd approach involved heating (3 K/min) up to \n\n1243 - 1273 K, maintenance at the upper  temperature for 2 - 70 hours, with consecutive cooling (2 K/min) \n\nand measurements under isothermal conditions in the temperature range 973 - 1273 K with the step of 50 K. \n\nBasically, the collection of data on each temperature continued until the complete equilibration; for selected \n\ncompositions in the series (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-? the stable length could not be attained during a reasonable time \n\nperiod, and the isothermal tests were restricted by 20 - 40 hours. The thermal expansion coefficients and \n\nchemically-induced isothermal expansion were evaluated in the flow of air, Ar or CO-CO2; the latter mixture \n\nwas formed by preliminary passing CO2 through an electrochemical oxygen pump where oxygen was \n\nevacuated from the gas mixture under fixed current of 300 mA. The oxygen partial pressure was controlled \n\nby an oxygen sensor located on the exit from the dilatometer. The isothermal chemical expansion in the \n\ncorresponding atmosphere with respect to air at a given temperature T was calculated as \n\n \n\n0 ,\n\n0 ,\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n\natm T\n\nC\n\nair T\n\nL\nL\n\nL\nL\n\n?\n\n? ??+ ? ?\n? ?\n\n= ?\n? ??+ ? ?\n? ?\n\n   (Eq. 2.1) \n\n \n\nwhere ( )0 ,atm TL L?\n and ( )0 ,air TL L?\n\n correspond to relative elongation of the sample on heating from the 300 K \n\nup to the temperature T in the corresponding atmosphere or in air, respectively. \n\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a Setaram SetSys 16/18 instruments in a flow \n\nof air, Ar or 10% H2 - N2 mixture dried with silicagel prior to entering the measuring chamber. Since \n\ncomplete reduction of the materials studied into compositions with a certain stoichiometry could not be \n\nachieved under the experimental conditions, the obtained data were analyzed using relative mass changes \n\nupon thermal or redox cycling with respect to 573 K in air or, in the case of isothermal measurement, with \n\nrespect to the mass in air under given temperature. For evaluation of the kinetics of oxygen exchange, \n\ntransient studies were carried out under isothermal conditions by sequential replacement of air atmosphere by \n\nAr and 10% H2 - N2 until the equilibration and in the reverse order. Al2O3 powder was used as the reference \n\nsample for the calibration of the equipment. \n\n\n\n103 \n\n \n\n \n\nTotal conductivity and Seebeck coefficient measurements \n\n \n\nThe total conductivity of bar-shaped ceramic specimens was measured by 4-probe DC technique. A \n\nscheme of the samples for the conductivity and Seebeck coefficient measurements as functions of p(O2) and \n\ntemperature is shown in Fig. 2.1. Optionally, in order to ensure a better contact between Pt leads and the \n\nsample, the surface region where the contact takes place was preliminary coated with Pt paste (supplied by \n\nHeraeus or GEM). For measurements of the conductivity in air, the current leads were pressed to the lateral \n\nfacets of the bar, in order to provide more uniform current flow through the sample. The activation energy Ea \n\nof the total conductivity ? was evaluated using the standard Arrhenius equation: \n\n \n\n0= exp - a\nA E\n\nT RT\n?\n\n? ?\n? ?\n? ?\n\n  (Eq. 2.2) \n\n \nwhere A0 is the pre-exponential factor, T is the temperature, R is the gas constant. \n\nThe cell for isothermal measurements of the total conductivity and Seebeck coefficient consists of \n\nan electrochemical oxygen pump and sensor (Fig. 2.2) isolated with a glass sealant layer which suppresses a \n\ndirect impact of current flux through the pump on the signal from the sensor originating from distribution of \n\nthe current within YSZ. For the thermoelectric power measurements, the sample was fixed between two B-\n\ntype thermocouples (Fig. 2.1) one end of each also served as a potential probe for measuring thermal e.m.f. \n\nof the sample.  \n\n,\n\n,\n\nthermocouple\n\nthermocouple\n\nA\n\nV  \n\n,\n\n,\n\nA\n\nV\n\nvacuum\npump\n\nO2-CO\n\noxygen\npump\n\nsamples\n\nglass\nsealant\n\noxygen\nsensor\n\nthermocouple\n\nthermocouple\n\nFig. 2.1.

Schematic representation of the cell for the \nconductivity and Seebeck coefficient measurements \n\n\n\n104 \n\n \n\nThe thermopower was determined under a temperature gradient of 15 - 20 K; the higher potential \n\nwas formally assigned to a hotter end of the sample. Prior to the tests, the cell was evacuated with a vacuum \n\npump and filled with O2 - CO2 mixture. In the process of measurements, the p(O2) required was adjusted by \n\nelectrochemical pumping of oxygen in/out of the cell and controlled by the sensor. The studies were \n\nperformed in 973 - 1223 K. After each reduction run, selected points were re-collected on oxidation in order \n\nto control possible structural transitions, phase decomposition or ceramics failure. The equilibration criteria \n\nof the sample after a change in either p(O2) or temperature included the relaxation rates of the conductivity \n\nand thermopower less than 0.05%/min and 0.001 \u00b5 V/K\u00d7min, respectively. Due to stagnated gas diffusion \n\nand compositional instabilities at p(O2) in the range 10\n-11 - 10-6 atm, and resultant hysteresis phenomena, the \n\ndata in this region were basically excluded from consideration. \n\nThe measured values of the total conductivity and Seebeck coefficient were used for calculation of \n\nthe concentration of charge carries and their mobility. For the materials with predominant p-type electronic \n\ntransport, the Seebeck coefficient ? is related with the charge carrier concentration p using the Heikes \n\nformula [21, 166] \n\n \n\n? ln\nk N p\n\ne p\n\n?\n= ?    (Eq. 2.3) \n\nor \n\n? ln\nk N p\n\ne p\n\n? ?\n= ?   (Eq. 2.4) \n\n \n\nwhere N is the number of states, k is Boltzmann constant, e is the elementary charge and ? in Eq. (2.4) is a \n\nconstant related with spin-degeneracy factor. In Eq. (2.3), any spin-degeneracy phenomena are neglected. \n\nThe hole mobility (\u00b5p) was evaluated from the conductivity data as \n\n \n\n/\np fu uc\n\nep N V? \u00b5= ?   (Eq. 2.5) \n\n \n\nwhere Nfu is the number of formula units per unit cell, Vuc is the unit-cell volume, and p is calculated from \n\nEqs. (2.3) - (2.4) and is related to formula unit. In the case when the exact value of the number of states N \n\ncannot be determined, the analysis is carried out operating with the values (p/N) and (\u00b5p\u00d7N) which are \n\ncalculated from Eqs. (2.3) - (2.5). \n\n \n\nDetermination of oxygen permeation fluxes, bulk oxygen tracer diffusion and surface exchange \n\ncoefficients \n\n \n\nThe oxygen transport-related parameters were determined only for gas-tight ceramics. The oxygen \n\npermeability (OP) through a ceramic membrane is associated with simultaneous migration of oxide ions and \n\nelectrons induced by a gradient of oxygen chemical/electrochemical potential at the membrane surfaces. \n\n\n\n105 \n\n \n\nUnder the absence of external electrical current, the oxygen flux j through a dense mixed conductor of the \n\nthickness L, placed under the oxygen chemical potential gradient, is given by [571, 572]: \n\n \n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n216\nion e\n\nO\n\nion e\n\nRT\nj d\n\nF L\n\n\u00b5\n\n\u00b5\n\n? ?\n\u00b5\n\n? ?\n=\n\n+?\n  (Eq. 2.6) \n\n \n\nwhere ?ion and ?e denote the ionic and electronic conductivity of the membrane material and \u00b5 1 and \u00b5 2 \n\ncorrespond to oxygen chemical potential at the permeate and feed side, respectively. For clarifying the effects \n\nof surface kinetics-related limitations, one should introduce the value of specific oxygen permeability J(O2) \n\n[573]: \n\n \n\n( )\n1\n\n2\n2\n\n2 1 1\n\nln\npjRTL\n\nJ O jL\np\u00b5 \u00b5\n\n?\n? ?\n\n= = ? ?\n? ? ?\n\n  (Eq. 2.7) \n\n \n\nwith p1 and p2 corresponding to oxygen partial pressures at the membrane permeate and feed sides, \n\nrespectively. In the case of fast exchange kinetics at the membrane/gas interfaces, the value J(O2) should be \n\nthickness-independent, while the permeation flux is expected to be proportional to reciprocal thickness. \n\nWhen the oxygen transport is determined exceptionally by the rates of the surface processes, the permeation \n\nflux is thickness-independent, while the specific permeability linearly increases with the membrane \n\nthickness. \n\nThe experimental cell for electrochemical measurements of OP is schematically illustrated in Fig. \n\n2.3. The cell consists of an electrochemical oxygen pump and a sensor made of 8YSZ. The contacts between \n\nthe Pt leads and zirconia surface were ensured by multiple coating and firing Pt paste. In order to eliminate \n\nany direct influence of current through the pump on the sensor, an additional zirconia ring was introduced \n\nbetween the electrochemical parts and fixed with glass-ceramic sealant (Tseal = 1440 - 1450 K). After sealing \n\nthe ceramic membrane of the material studied (Tseal = 1360 - 1380 K), a series of direct currents Ipump was \n\npassed through the pump in the direction of elimination of oxygen out of the cell, corresponding to the \n\npermeation fluxes in accordance with \n\n \n\n4\npump\n\nI\nj\n\nFS\n=    (Eq. 2.8) \n\n \n\nwhere S relates to the active area of the membrane which the permeation flux proceeds through.

As follows from Eq. (2.6), for materials with dominant electronic conductivity at the absence of the \n\nsurface-related limitations, the partial oxygen ionic conductivity ?O may be evaluated from the oxygen flux \n\nusing the expression [3]: \n\n \n\n( )\n[ ]\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n1\n\n16\n\nln\nO\n\np\n\nF d j\np\n\nRT p\n?\n\n? ??\n= ? ?? ??? ?\n\n  (Eq. 2.10) \n\n \n\nIn the case of simultaneous limitations of the surface exchange kinetics and bulk diffusion, their relative roles \n\nwere estimated using an approximate relationship derived in [320]: \n\n \n\n2\n-1 -12\n\n2 1\n1\n\n1 16\nln\n\namb\n\np F d\nk k\n\nj p RT?\n\n? ?\n? = + +? ?\n\n? ?\n  (Eq. 2.11) \n\n \n\nwhere amb?  is the ambipolar conductivity (equivalent to the ionic conductivity for materials with dominant \n\nelectronic transport) averaged over the range p1 - p2, and the values k1 and k2 relate to the surface exchange \n\nrates at the permeate and feed sides, respectively. Solving the system of equations, where each corresponds to \n\nEq. (2.11) with a definite membrane thickness d, yields the values amb?  and \n-1 -1\n\n2 1k k+  under the given \n\ngradient p2/p1. No attempts to separate k1 and k2 were undertaken in the framework of the study. \n\nAn alternative technique of OP measurements involved placing the membrane studied under the \n\ngradient of flowing air vs. H2 - H2O - N2 gradient. The variations of the oxygen content in the gas atmosphere \n\nat the permeate side were evaluated using electrochemical oxygen sensors at the inlet and outlet of the \n\ncorresponding compartment of the cell. The measurements were carried out by Dr. A.A. Yaremchenko, the \n\ndetails of the method and calculations can be found elsewhere [574]. \n\n\n\n107 \n\n \n\nThe bulk oxygen tracer diffusion (D*) and surface exchange (k) coefficients were assessed using the \n18O/16O isotopic exchange depth profile method carried out in the Institute of Solid State Physics, \n\nChernogolovka, Russia, by Dr. S.I. Bredikhin and Yu.S. Fedotov. Prior to 18O/16O exchange annealing, the \n\npolished and cleaned ceramic samples were equilibrated in air of normal isotopic abundance.  Afterwards, \n\nthe chamber was evacuated and labeled oxygen (95 % enriched 18O2) was introduced to reach p(O2) = 0.2 \n\natm. The samples were annealed at 1023 -1223 K for 1 - 45.5 hours followed by quenching. The 18O \n\npenetration profiles were determined by time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) using a \n\nTOF-SIMS.5-100P instrument (ION-TOF GmbH, Germany) operated in the depth profile mode, with a 45\u00b0 \n\nincidence 25 keV Bi+ primary ion beam and 45\u00b0 incidence 2 keV Cs+ sputter ion beam. The crater depth was \n\nmeasured after the SIMS analysis by surface profilometry (Taylor\u2013Hobson Talystep). An example of 18O \n\npenetration profile obtained for La0.5Sr0.5Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? is shown in Fig. 2.4. \n\n \n\n  \n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\nExchange conditions:\nT = 1173 K, 20 h\n\np(\n18\n\nO\n2\n) = 0.2 atm\n\nLa\n0.5\n\nSr\n0.5\n\nMn\n0.5\n\nTi\n0.5\n\nO\n3-?\n\nC\n (\n\nx\n,t\n\n)\n\nx, \u00b5m\n \n\nFig. 2.4. Example of the 18O penetration profile for \nLa0.5Sr0.5Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? at 1223 K. \n\n \n\nThe rate of isotopic exchange across the gas/solid interface is assumed to be directly proportional to \n\nthe difference in isotope concentration (C) between the gas and the solid, leading to the boundary condition \n\n[337, 575]: \n\n( )g s\n0x\n\nC\nD* k C C\n\nx =\n\n?\n? = ?\n\n?\n (Eq. 2.12) \n\nwhere x is the depth, and Cg and Cs are the \n18O isotope ratio in the gas phase and in the surface, respectively. \n\nAssuming that the isotope concentration in the gas phase is constant, the diffusion equation for this boundary \n\ncondition and a semi-infinite medium is formulated as [337, 575]: \n\n2\nbg\n\ng bg\n\n2\nerfc exp erfc\n\n2 2\n\nC( x,t ) C x kx k t x kt\n\nC C D*D* t D* t\n\n? ? ?+ +? ? ? ?\n= ? \u00d7? ?? ? ? ?\n\n? ? ? ? ?? ?\n (Eq. 2.13) \n\nwhere C(x,t) is the 18O isotope fraction, t is the exchange annealing time, and Cbg is the natural background \n\nlevel of 18O (0.20%). D* and k were obtained by non-linear least squares fitting of the SIMS data to Eq. \n\n(2.13). \n\n \n\n\n\n108 \n\n \n\nPreparation of the electrode layers and polarization measurements \n\n \n\nPolarization measuremets were performed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy using 3-\n\nelectrode configuration. The cell geometry is shown in Fig. 2.5.; such a location of the counter (CE) and \n\nreference electrodes (RE) was selected in accordance with [576, 577]. The tests were carried out on cells \n\ncomposed of perovskite, perovskite-based composite or cermet electrodes. Gas-tight pellets LSGM or \n\nLa10Si5AlO26.5 of 16 - 18 mm diameter and 1.5 - 2.0 mm thickness were used as solid electrolytes. The \n\nconditions of the fabrication of the cells with perovskite-based anode and cathodes are listed in Table 2.3. \n\nBasically, the deposition of the woring electrode (WE) layers (diameter 5.0 - 6.0 mm) involved preparation \n\nof ethanol-based suspension of the material studied followed by paint-brushing the layer onto the substrate \n\nwith subsequent firing in air. Optionally, a layer of submicron CGO20 powder mixed with 2 wt.% \n\nCo(NO3)2\u00d74H2O in ethanol was preliminary applied onto the electrolyte to achieve the surface density of 3 - \n\n5 mg/cm2 followed by firing at 1473 K in air and subsequent deposition of the electrode layer. \n\n \n\nTable 2.3.

Schematic representation of the set-up for \npolarization measurement in reducing atmospheres \n\n \n\nThe CE was applied on the opposite side of the electrolyte membrane symmetrically with respect to \n\nthe WE. The RE (0.9 - 1.3 mm of diameter) was placed on the distance of 7.0 - 9.0 mm from the nearest edge \n\nof the WE; both CE and RE were prepared by coating a thin layer of Pt paste (Heraeus) subsequently fired at \n\n1203 - 1373 K. In order to ensure appropriate current collection, Pt gauze was pressed to the WE and CE. \n\nThe point contact with the RE was provided by pressing the tip of a thick wire (0.5 mm of diameter). No \n\ncoverage of the WE with Pt or other metal paste was carried out in order to avoid an interference of \n\nadditional catalytic effects on the electrochemical properties. \n\n\n\n111 \n\n \n\nThe equipment for electrochemical measurements in reductive atmospheres is shown in Fig. 2.6. \n\nThe cell was placed onto a tip of an alumina tube (14.5 mm of inner diameter), simultaneously ensuring the \n\ncontacts between the electrodes and the current collectors, while the lateral surface of the electrolyte was \n\ncovered with a thick layer of ethanol-based suspension of sealing glass powder (Tseal = 1173 - 1223 K). Prior \n\nto the measurements, the WE and CE compartments were flushed with humidified 10% H2 - N2 (50 ml/min) \n\nand air (12.5 ml/min), respectively. The composition of the gas fluxes was settled with Bronkhorst mass-flow \n\ncontrollers and controlled by oxygen sensors. For evaluation of cathode performance, a simplified setup was \n\nused, without oxygen sensors and necessity for gas separation. \n\nThe electrochemical tests were carried out in galvanostatic mode using Autolab PGSTAT302 \n\nEquipment. The impedance data between the WE and RE were recorded in the frequency range from 1 MHz \n\nto 1 mHz; the amplitude of the alternating current varied in the range 0.5 - 2.0 mA. The overpotential (?) was \n\ncalculated as \n\n \n\n? = U - IROhm  (Eq. 2.14) \n\n \n\nwhere U is the potential difference between the WE and RE, I is the current flowing between WE and CE, \n\nand IROhm is the ohmic contribution into the total potential drop. In order to estimate the electrode \n\npolarization resistance the values of the corresponding ohmic resistance ROhm were extracted from impedance \n\nspectra. The ohmic and polarization resistances were evaluated from the intersection of the high- or low-\n\nfrequency arcs with the axis Z\u2019 in accordance with Fig. 2.7: \n\n \n\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n\n10\n\n30\n\n50\n\n70\n\n-Z\n\",\n\n O\nhm\n\n<\ncm\n\n2\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n0 4 8 12\n\nZ', Ohm<cm2\n\nelectrode: (La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-?\n(CeO2-, Ni-modified)\n\n873 K\n10% H\n\n2\n-N\n\n2\n-H\n\n2\nO\n\n1073 K\n\np(O\n2\n)=0.21 atm\n\nelectrode: (La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-?\n(PrOx-modified)\n\nelectrolyte: La10Si5AlO26.5\n\nohmic resistance\n\nohmic resistance\n\nA\n\nB\n\npolarization\nresistance\n\npolarization\nresistance\n\n \n\nFig. 2.7.

Pseudobinary (La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-? - SrTiO3-? system and alternative \n\nLaCrO3-?-based materials \n\n \n\nChromite perovskites represent a wide group of alternative anode materials possessing high redox \n\nstability and acceptable thermomechanical behaviour, while the transport and electrochemical properties may \n\nbe optimized by an appropriate cation doping [8, 9, 15, 18, 113, 210, 212]. On the other hand, partial or \n\ncomplete replacement of Cr cations is desirable for high-temperature applications, in order to avoid the \n\nformation of volatile chromium oxides, hydroxides and other compounds containing high-valent Cr species \n\nor to suppress the reactivity with other cell components [44, 82, 139, 142, 285]. In accordance with numerous \n\nreports, the systems (La,A)CrO3-?, (La,A)MnO3-? and (La,A)TiO3-? exhibit an unlimited mutual solubility \n\nprovided that B-site doping is accompanied by appropriate variations of the cation ratio in A-sublattice [16, \n\n131, 155-159, 164, 168, 171, 352], while cation modifications in B-sublattice may ensure a promising \n\ncombination of the functional characteristics such as the tolerance towards a wide range of operation \n\nconditions, electronic and ionic transport, thermomechanical properties and catalytic activity [8, 10, 16, 212]. \n\nThe present section is devoted to studying phase and structural stability, thermal and chemical expansion, \n\nmixed electronic and ionic conduction of (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-? and applicability of the title \n\nmaterials for anode or cathode utilizations. \n\nDoping LaCrO3-based compositions with Fe is considered as another approach to reduce the \n\npolarization resistance of chromite-based anode layers. However, the literature data on the phase and \n\nstructural behaviour upon redox cycling, oxidation state of the constituent transition metal cations as well as \n\ntransport mechanism in Fe-doped chromites are contradictive [9, 17, 44, 178, 179, 191, 206, 212]. The \n\nelectrode performance of (La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-? has been reported to be somewhat lower or comparable to that of \n\n(La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-? analogues [9, 212, 264], but Fe-doped compositions exhibited an enhanced reactivity \n\nwith gallate-based electrolytes [9] leading to higher ohmic losses and raising the problem of the long-term \n\nstability. This drawback can be to some extent avoided by applying buffer layers between the components of \n\nthe electrochemical cell. Moreover, the insufficient chemical stability and enhanced chemical expansion may \n\ncause long-term degradation of (La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-? anodes. In order to clarify the effect of Fe-doping into \n\nchromites, the following part concerns functional characteristics of (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? (x = 0.3, 0.4) \n\nperovskites and polarization behaviour of the corresponding anodes in contact with LSGM electrolyte with \n\nCGO20 sublayer. \n\nIn recent years, much attention has been drawn to a strategy of segregation from the perovskite \n\nstructure of catalytically active phases, in particular highly dispersed metallic particles [15, 17, 184, 186, 188, \n\n215, 544]. The presence of metal droplets with a large surface area has been reported to accelerate the \n\nelementary steps related to gas/solid interface and allow to catalyze the oxidation processes [15, 186, 211, \n\n544]. Cation-stoichiometric perovskites may be thermodynamically intolerant towards simultaneous lowering \n\nthe amount of B-site cations and oxygen atoms in anionic sublattice leading to separation of lantanide- or \n\nalkali-earth metal-enriched secondary phases upon reduction [15, 135]. This issue can be partially resolved \n\nby introduction of cation vacancies into A-sublattice. On the other hand, generation of substantial amounts of \n\n\n\n114 \n \n\nthe metallic phase and their subsequent agglomeration may lead to performance instability of the anode \n\nlayers, and the control of the concentration of dopant cations and reduction process is required. The final part \n\nof the present chapter is addressed to appraisal of (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? perovskites as cathode \n\nand anode materials for IT-SOFCs. The presence of Mg is expected to ensure a contribution of the ionic \n\ntransport and surface exchange into the overall electrode mechanism. Furthermore, even if a slight excess of \n\nB-cations in the perovskite causes separation (Mg,Ni)O secondary phase, its presence might promote the \n\nformation of dispersed Ni particles upon reduction [578, 579]. \n\n \n\n3.1.

Thermal expansion \n\n \n\nThe results of dilatometric measurements are summarized in Figs. 3.3 - 3.4 and Tables 3.2 - 3.5. The \n\naverage linear thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) of (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-? vary in the \n\nrange (10.8 - 14.5)\u00d710-6 K-1, similar to the other chromite- and manganite-based materials, as shown in \n\nTables 1.2.2. and 1.3.3. Careful examination of the thermal expansion data shows that the TECs tend to a \n\nmodest increase with strontium and titanium additions. An increase of the TEC with alkali-earth metal \n\ncontent is typical for perovskites [112, 131, 143, 329], while introduction of reasonable amounts of Ti into \n\nchromites and manganites is known to suppress the expansion [16, 131, 156, 163, 231]. \n\n \n\nTable 3.2.

In particular, all the compositions showed a gradual increase in TECs \n\nat elevated temperatures, consistently with the chemical contribution into the overall expansion. At the same \n\ntime, the oxygen losses on heating in air are minor (???0.002) even for (La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-?, and the \n\nincrease in TEC values with temperature and x observable in Fig. 3.3 and Table 3.2 results primarily from \n\nshifting redox equilibria in the perovskite lattice. Namely, co-doping with Sr2+ and Ti4+ or increasing the \n\ntemperature seems to promote disproportionation of manganese: \n\n\n\n118 \n \n\n2Mn3+ ? Mn4+ + Mn2+  (Eq. 3.1) \n \n\nThe process leads to raising the concentration of p-type electronic change carriers and facilitates \n\noxygen losses on heating. Moreover, in accordance with ionic radii of Mn2+, Mn3+, Mn4+ (0.83 \u00c5, 0.645 \u00c5, \n\n0.53 \u00c5, respectively, suggesting the octahedral coordination and high-spin state of the cations [133]), the \n\ndisproportionation of Mn3+ should indeed result in an overall enlargement of the cation sizes. On the other \n\nhand, Mn4/3+ and Cr4+/3+ species should be interrelated by redox equilibrium \n\n \n\n Cr4+ + Mn3+ ? Mn4+ + Cr3+  (Eq. 3.2) \n \nand the concentration of the chromium and manganese species is also affected by temperature or the doping \n\ndegree. The contribution of both processes into the thermal expansion behavior is consistent with chemically-\n\ninduced expansivity and with the variations of electronic conductivity and Seebeck coefficient, discussed in \n\nfollowing sections. \n\nAnalyzing the dependence of TECs on p(O2), one may observe that reduction of \n\n(La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? leads to a decrease of the thermal expansivity (Table 3.3). On the other hand, \n\nsimultaneous introduction of Sr and Ti gradually reverses this trend; such a behaviour is in accordance with \n\ndecreasing the chemical expansivity on heating or cooling (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? and \n\n(La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-?, respectively, as demonstrated below. \n\n \n\nTable 3.3.

Another possibility \n\nmight relate to a minor mechanical failure of (La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? on reduction; such a phenomenon \n\nhas been observed on related compounds [16, 105, 317]. One should note that a slight lowering of TECs at \n\nlower p(O2) is typical for chromite perovskites (Table 3.3) which are characterized by an obvious correlation \n\nbetween the oxygen stoichiometry variations and dimensional changes. \n\n \n\n3.1.3.

[10], the chemically-induced expansion of \n\nTi-substituted compositions on decreasing p(O2) down to 6\u00d710\n-4 atm is negligible, lower than 0.03% (Fig. 3.4 \n\nand Table 3.4).

Temperature dependencies of the relative \nlength changes of LSMCT3 (A) and LSMCT5 (B) \nceramics in air, Ar and CO-CO2 atmospheres \n\n \n\nIn accordance with the model described in Chapter 1.2.4, the p(O2)-induced dimensional changes of \n\nperovskite-type materials containing transition metal cations are primarily associated with variations of their \n\noxidation state and ionic radii [193, 196, 234, 236]. The level of the chemical strains indicated in Table 3.5 is \n\nclose to that observable for La0.8Sr0.2Mn0.5Al0.5O3\u00b1? and La0.4Sr0.6Mn0.6Ti0.4O3\u00b1? perovskites (0.6 - 0.7% upon \n\nreduction from air into H2 - H2O - Ar atmosphere). Taking into account the high and close Mn concentration \n\nin the perovskites indicated and in (La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? as well as comparatively facilitated \n\nreducibility of Mn4+ species, one may suggest that the redox couple Mn4+/3+ is primarily responsible for the \n\ndimension behaviour observed. In particular, extensive oxygen losses on reduction and contribution of the \n\nprocesses described by Eqs. (3.1), (3.2) is confirmed by trends in the total conductivity and Seebeck \n\ncoefficient with p(O2), in particular, by the conductivity drop at low oxygen pressures, shown in following \n\nsections. Again, the chemically induced expansion of (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-? increases with \n\nincreasing x, thus confirming that Sr and Ti co-doping promotes oxygen losses and shifts redox equilibria \n\nbetween Mn4+/3+/2+ and Cr4+/3+ cations. \n\nIrrespective to the compositional trends, the overall level of the thermal and chemical expansion \n\nobserved in the wide range of conditions is moderate. This makes it possible to use the title materials in \n\ncontact with solid oxide electrolytes, such as stabilized zirconia, CeO2-based compositions, LSGM or \n\nLa10Si5AlO26.5 [30, 227, 580, 581]. Nonetheless, one should still be cautious concerning the strains at \n\nelevated temperatures necessary to fabricate electrochemical cells. For example, cooling \n\n(La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? from 1373 to 973 K in air leads to the contraction within ?T ? -0.54%. If \n\n\n\n121 \n \n\nassuming that a relatively thin layer of solid electrolyte with a TEC of 11.1\u00d710?6 K?1 is fired onto a thick \n\n(La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? substrate, reaching an unstrained condition at 1373 K in air, the expected strain \n\ndifference after cooling down to 973 K is in the order of ?? ? 0.10%. The compressive stresses imposed on \n\nthe thin solid-electrolyte layer can then be estimated as ?C ? ??E/(1-?) ? -179MPa, using typical values of the \n\nelastic constants E = 125 GPa and ? ? 0.3 known for LSGM at 973 K [582]. These low and compressive \n\nstresses should be acceptable for applications of the electrochemical cells. However, the thermal and \n\nchemical strain components of (La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? almost compensate each other under reducing \n\nconditions, for instance, (?T+?C) ? -0.02% at 973 K and p(O2) = 10\n-19 atm. Under these conditions, the strain \n\ndifference between the layers becomes ?? ? -0.44%, imposing excessive tensile stresses on the thin \n\nelectrolyte layer (for the above-quoted elastic constants, ?C ? 786 MPa). On the other hand, actual stresses \n\nmay be significantly lowered when one of the contacting layers is very porous, as for the deposition of a thin \n\nporous electrode onto a thicker solid electrolyte support. In the latter case, the stresses under reducing \n\nconditions revert from tensile to compressive, thus providing better thermomechanical stability. \n\n \n\n3.1.4. Total conductivity \n\n \n\nThe conductivity in (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-? is predominantly electronic; the oxygen \n\npermeation data presented below show that the oxygen-ionic contribution is lower that 10-3 %. Fig. 3.5 \n\ndisplays the temperature dependencies of total conductivity (?) of the ceramic materials studied at \n\natmospheric p(O2). In air, the conductivity has a thermally-activated character; the activation energies Ea, \n\ncalculated in accordance with Eq.

The numbers 1, 2, 3 show \ncharacteristic conditions corresponding to changes in the redox behaviour (see text) \n\n\n\n123 \n \n\nIntroduction of Sr into LaCrO3-? or LaMnO3-? is known to promote the electronic transport and \n\nreduce the activation energy [121, 131, 143]. Moreover, SrTiO3-? and SrMnO3-?-based compositions exhibit \n\nbroadband conduction mechanism in reductive atmospheres [320, 381, 457, 583], and the reduction of the \n\nactivation energies might be associated with partial transition in the transport mechanism and corresponding \n\ntrends in the electronic charge carrier mobility. In turn, temperature dependencies of the charge-carrier \n\nconcentration should be governed by two factors having opposite effects, namely thermal excitation and \n\nincreasing oxygen deficiency when temperature increases. \n\nThe oxygen partial pressure dependencies of the electrical properties (Figs. 3.6 - 3.7) exhibit a series \n\nof specific features typical for LaMnO3- and LaCrO3-based solid solutions [184, 214, 226, 323]. First of all, \n\nboth the Seebeck coefficient (?) and conductivity are essentially p(O2)-independent in oxidizing and \n\nmoderately reducing environments, indicating that the oxygen stoichiometry changes are minor. Increasing x \n\nlowers the thermopower down to negative values at x > 0.2. This trend is not surprising taking into account \n\nthat strontium titanate exhibits n-type electronic transport. However, reducing oxygen pressure below a \n\ncertain level, marked as \u201c1\u201d in Fig. 3.6B, gives rise to increasing oxygen deficiency, resulting in increasing \n\nSeebeck coefficient and decreasing conductivity. This type of behavior observed for all compositions \n\nprovides an argument in favor of dominant p-type electronic transport, despite the negative ? values for Sr- \n\nand Ti-rich materials. \n\n \n\n1.32\n\n1.38\n\n1.44\n\n1.50\n\n1.14\n\n1.20\n\n1.26\n\n1.32\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n-20\n\n-15\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n-18 -14 -10 -6 -2\n\n1.14\n\n1.20\n\n1.26\n\n1.32\n\n-18 -14 -10 -6 -2\n-40\n\n-35\n\n-30\n\n-25\n\nlo\ng \n\n?\n (\n\nS\n/c\n\nm\n)\n\nA\n\nC\n\nB\n\nLSMCT2\n\nLSMCT4\n\nLSMCT5\n\n?\n, \u00b5\n\nV\n/K\n\nD\n 923 K\n 1023 K\n 1073 K\n 1123 K\n 1173 K\n\nE\n\n \n\nF\n\nlog p(O\n2\n) (atm)\n\n \n \nFig. 3.7.

A \n\npossible origin of the thermopower variations in (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-?, associated with shifting the \n\nredox equilibrium between Cr and Mn cations towards formation of Mn4+ and Cr3+ species on heating (Eqs. \n\n(3.1), (3.2)) and site-exclusion effects around Cr4+ cations, was suggested in [10]. In the case of (La0.75-\n\nxSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-? (x = 0.4 - 0.5), all titanium cations under oxidizing conditions are expected to \n\nhave constant oxidation state, 4+; the site-exclusion phenomena near Ti4+, if any, should remain essentially \n\nunchanged with increasing temperature. Since the oxygen stoichiometry variations with temperature are \n\nmuch smaller than might be expected from the thermopower changes, the decrease in Seebeck coefficient \n\noriginates from thermal excitation of p-type electronic charge carriers in accordance with the Heikes formula \n\n[26, 166]. The parameters (p/N) and (\u00b5p\u00d7N) characterizing the population of the electron holes and their \n\nmobility were calculated from the data on the conductivity and Seebeck coefficient using Eqs.

This makes it possible to \n\nconclude that the small-polaron mechanism is dominant, irrespective of the progressive decrease in the \n\nmobility activation energy indicating an increasing role of the broad-band mechanism on doping. In the case \n\nof (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-?, the (p/N) ratio decreases with increasing temperature as the equilibrium \n\nbetween the B-site cations (Eq. (3.2)) shifts towards Mn4+ formation and the site-blocking effects near Cr4+ \n\ndisappear [10]; (La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? exhibit a modest, but clearly visible opposite trend (Fig. 3.9). If \n\nconsidering the stable oxidation state of Ti4+ under oxidizing conditions, rising (p/N) with temperature \n\nprovides an evidence for progressive Mn3+ disproportionation, leading to Mn4+ and Mn2+ formation (Eq. \n\n(3.1)). The increasing Mn4+ concentration is responsible for higher oxygen losses and for the larger chemical \n\nand thermal expansion observed for Ti- and Sr-rich compositions. The variations in Seebeck coefficient, \n\nwhich becomes negative on co-doping, originate primarily from increasing Mn4+ concentration; the \n\noccupancy of manganese sites available for hole hopping in (La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? under oxidizing \n\nconditions is higher than 50%. The latter factor contributes also to the relatively low hole mobility which \n\ndecreases on Ti and Sr co-doping, mainly due to blocking of electronic transfer by the stable Ti4+ cations. \n\nComparison of the oxygen pressures corresponding to the onset of large oxygen losses (point \u201c1\u201d in \n\nFig. 3.6) with the low-p(O2) stability limits of Cr-, Mn- and Ti-containing oxide phases [26, 39, 46], as \n\nshown in Fig. 3.10, suggests that these phenomena are mainly associated with reduction of manganese \n\ncations rather than with phase decomposition, in agreement with XRD (Fig. 3.1). \n\n \n\n8.2 8.6 9.0 9.4 9.8\n\n104/T, K-1\n\n-0.39\n\n-0.33\n\n-0.27\n\n-0.21\n\n-0.15\n\nlo\ng \n\n(p\n/N\n\n)\n\n-2.1\n\n-1.9\n\n-1.7\n\n-1.5\n\nlo\ng \n\n(\u00b5\np<\n\nN\n) \n\n(c\nm\n\n2&lt;\ns-\n\n1&lt;\nV\n\n-1\n)\n\n(La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5O3-?\n(La0.55Sr0.45)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.3Ti0.2O3-?\n(La0.35Sr0.65)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.1Ti0.4O3-?\n(La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-?\n\np(O\n2\n) = 0.21 atm\n\nE\na\n = \u00b124.4 0.5 kJ/mol\n\n\u00b117.7 0.4 kJ/mol\n\u00b111.2 1.3 kJ/mol\n\n\u00b16.0 0.5 kJ/mol\n\nA\n\nB\n\n \n\nFig. 3.9.

Literature data on the phase stability of Cr- \nand Mn-containing phases [39, 44, 46] and iso-\nstoichiometric line for TiO1.995 [26] are shown for \ncomparison. \n\n \n\n \n\nNotice also that the corresponding p(O2) values are essentially independent of x in (La0.75-\n\nxSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-?, indicating that the electronic transport processes and oxygen deficiency \n\nvariations are determined by the B sites occupied by manganese, whereas Cr and Ti cations form a redox-\n\nstable matrix. Another possibility of the comparable level of the decomposition limits might relate to two \n\nopposite effects of Sr and Ti introduction on the stability, with resultant mutual compensation. \n\nAt oxygen partial pressures below approximately 10-13 atm, the slope of the ? vs. p(O2) curves \n\ndecreases (Fig. 3.6A); the Seebeck coefficient of Ti-rich compositions exhibits a maximum and a minimum \n\nmarked in Fig. 3.6B as \u201c2\u201d and \u201c3\u201d, respectively. Most likely, these regimes are associated with rising \n\ncontributions of the Mn3+/2+ and Ti4+/3+ redox couples. One should note that the low-p(O2) process (point \u201c3\u201d) \n\nis characterized by substantially lower enthalpy in comparison with those occurring in the perovskites studied \n\nat higher oxygen pressures (points \u201c1\u201d and \u201c2\u201d), decomposition of Mn3O4 or LaMnO3-? as well as formation \n\nof oxygen vacancies in TiO2-?. However, due to phase transitions typical for (La,Sr)(Mn,Cr)O3-? perovskites \n\non reduction [8, 113] and segregation of MnO traces (Fig. 3.1), quantitative analysis of the electrical \n\nproperties in this p(O2) range is problematic. Whatever the microscopic mechanisms, co-doping with Sr and \n\nTi leads to lower conductivity under reducing conditions; this should further increase the role of electronic \n\ntransport as the electrode performance-limiting factor, characteristic of parent (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? \n\n[10]. Consequently, the electrochemical activity of (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-? in reductive \n\natmospheres is expected to be lower for Sr- and Ti-enriched compositions. \n\n\n\n127 \n \n\n3.1.5.

The changes in the permeation \n\nfluxes are substantially larger than the level of experimental uncertainties, and are well reproducible for the \n\nmembranes with different thicknesses. The latter observation is illustrated by Fig. 3.12 (B and D), which \n\ncompares the values of specific oxygen permeability J(O2), calculated in accordance with Eq. (2.7). It should \n\nalso be mentioned that significant grain-boundary contributions to the oxygen ion diffusion are known for \n\nLaCrO3-, LaMnO3- and especially SrTiO3-based materials with low oxygen nonstoichiometry [112, 254, 336, \n\n339, 371, 512]. The microstructural features associated with liquid phase-assisted sintering were reported to \n\npromote fast ionic conduction along the boundaries [44]. \n\nFurther inspection of the results shown in Fig. 3.12 shows also a non-negligible role of the surface \n\nexchange kinetics. The specific oxygen permeability is proportional to (j\u00d7d) and should be thickness-\n\nindependent when the exchange processes are fast enough [10, 320]. For (La0.35Sr0.65)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.1Ti0.4O3-? \n\nmembranes, increasing the thickness leads to lower oxygen fluxes and higher J(O2) values due to a \n\ndecreasing role of the interfacial exchange. This complex mechanism makes it impossible to evaluate relative \n\ncontributions of the grain bulk, grain boundaries and surface-related processes to the overall membrane \n\nresistance to oxygen transfer. The oxygem ionic conductivity evaluated using the approach described in \n\nChapter 2 (Eq. 2.11) is as low as (1 - 5)\u00d710-4 S/cm at 1223 - 1273 K which is more than 10 times higher as \n\ncompared with that for La0.87Sr0.13Cr1.03O3-\u00f5 [198]. Nevertheless, this level of the ionic diffusion is still \n\ninsufficient to expect any considerable enhancement in the electrochemical reaction zone due to oxygen \n\ntransport through electrode bulk, as for (La,Sr)MnO3-based cathodes [324, 584]. \n\n \n\n3.1.6. Redox kinetics \n\n \n\nThe low values of the permeation fluxes through (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-? ceramics and \n\nresultant large errors in their determination do not allow to make an unambiguous conclusion about the effect \n\nof Sr and Ti content on the parameters responsible for the oxygen transport in the perovskites. At the same \n\ntime, knowledge of the relationships between the composition and transport characteristics is desirable with \n\nrespect to selection of the optimum composition for the electrochemical applications. In order to compare the \n\nrates of the surface exchange processes, mass relaxation studies were carried out on La0.75Sr0.25Mn0.5Cr0.5O3-? \n\nand La0.25Sr0.75Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? powders under isothermal conditions; an example of the transient behaviour is \n\nshown in Fig. 3.14. Both powders were produced by mechanical grinding ceramic samples which should \n\nproduce the powders with comparable surface area. \n\nThe redox kinetics was evaluated from TGA data collected on sequential switches of the atmosphere \n\nin the order air - Ar - 10% H2 - N2 - Ar - air, in accordance with the model \n\n \n\n( ) 1 2 exp\nt\n\nm t m m\n?\n\n? ?\n= + ?? ?\n\n? ?\n\n  (Eq. 3.3) \n\n \n\n\n\n130 \n \n\nwhere m, t, and ? are the mass, time and relaxation time constant, respectively.

Since the bulk \n\nionic transport in (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-? is rather slow, the low-p(O2) electrochemical activity \n\nshould primarily be related with the electronic conductivity of the materials under anodic conditions. \n\n \n\n3.1.7.

The results demonstrated a good reproducibility for \n\ndifferent series of the samples, as shown in the inset. No substantial alterations in the electrochemical \n\nbehavior were also observed after the current cycling and temperature variations in the range 873 - 1073 K; \n\nSEM inspections revealed no significant microstructural degradation after the measurements, both in air and \n\nin reducing atmospheres (Fig. 3.17). \n\nIn general, increasing x in (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-? system deteriorates the anode \n\nperformance. This trend correlates with the data on the electrical conductivity in the high-temperature range \n\n(Fig. 3.6), indicating that the electrode reaction rate under reducing conditions is strongly affected by the \n\nelectronic transport. The anodes in contact with La10Si5AlO26.5 showed higher overpotentials and a stronger \n\ntendency to limiting currents.

(A) \nillustrates the reproducibility of the results obtained \nfor different series of porous electrode samples and \n(B) shows cathodic and anodic polarization behaviour \nat 1073 K in air. \n\n \n\n \n\nUnder anodic polarization in air, the influence of solid electrolyte composition becomes less \n\npronounced. The trends under cathodic or anodic currents may partly originate from the incorporation of \n\nvariable-valence cations into the electrolyte surface during electrode preparation [10, 218]. Anodic \n\npolarization raises the oxygen chemical potentials both in the electrode and in the interfacial electrolyte \n\nlayers, locally increasing the concentration of oxygen species and oxidation state of the variable-valence \n\ncations. For the oxygen-hyperstoichiometric silicates where the ionic transport is dominated by interstitial \n\nanions [21-24, 585], the interfacial processes related to the oxygen transfer and diffusion should hence be \n\nfacilitated under anodic polarization and hampered due to cathodic reduction. \n\n\n\n134 \n \n\nIrrespective of the electrolyte composition, the anodic performance of (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? \n\nand (La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? in air is significantly higher compared to cathodic (Fig. 3.19). This \n\ndifference might be attributed to an enrichment of the electrolyte surface with transition metal cations \n\noxidized under anodic currents and resultant increasing p-type electronic conduction or catalytic activity at \n\nthe electrode/electrolyte interface. In accordance with previous studies, a slight dissolution of transition metal \n\ncations in the electrolyte lattice in the region close to the electrolyte/electrode or electrolyte/gas interface has \n\na positive impact on the performance. In particular, the exchange currents for Au cathodes applied onto YSZ \n\npreliminary coated with Fe2O3 were 2 - 3 orders lower in comparison with a similar cathode deposited onto \n\npure YSZ electrolyte. The effect of iron penetration into the electrolyte was primarily associated with an \n\nenhancement of the exchange currents, without variations in the slope of Tafel plots, indicating that the \n\noverall mechanism has not been affected by Fe dissolution in the fluorite lattice [586]. Similarly, an \n\nactivating effect was observed on incorporation of Ce, Mn, Pr, Co into YSZ or Cr, Mn, Ba into LSGM ([584, \n\n587, 588] and references cited). \n\nThe mechanism of the improvement is, however, unclear and hardly might be attributed to only \n\nelectronic conductivity. Although doping of zirconia-based compositions with Mn or Fe indeed increases the \n\nelectronic contribution, the overall level of the electronic transport still remains rather low to ensure a \n\nsufficient current collection [351, 589, 590]. At the same time, isotope exchange studies on Au-coated \n\nzirconia showed that the effect of the transition metals in the fluorite lattice relates primarily to catalytic \n\npromotion of the oxidation processes; namely, to stabilization of oxygen species adsorbed at Au/YSZ \n\ninterface [586]. Whatever the particular mechanism of the promotion of the cathodic processes over the \n\nelectrolyte surface, in the present work a participation of transition metal cations dissolved in the solid \n\nelectrolyte seems responsible for improved activity under anodic currents. The latter suggestion is, in \n\nparticular, confirmed by the effect of protective ceria-based layers on the electrode behaviour, as discussed in \n\nfollowing sections. \n\nSimilar to most oxide electrodes [10, 266, 591], the overpotentials of (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-\n\nxTixO3-? cathode layers can be drastically decreased by the infiltration of praseodymia, a result of enhanced \n\nexchange currents at both electrode/gas and electrolyte/gas interfaces. Nevertheless, the electrochemical \n\nactivity of porous (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-? layers in air remains low even after the surface-\n\nmodification; for example, the cathodic overpotential of (La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? - PrOx cathode on \n\nLSGM at current density of -80 mA/cm2 and 1073 K is as high as -190 mV. \n\nIn summary, the results show that co-doping of (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? by Sr\n2+ and Ti4+ makes \n\nit possible to decrease chromium content without essential deteriorating effects on the transport properties \n\nand electrode performance under oxidizing conditions. The moderate increase of the thermal and chemical \n\nexpansion, governed by the manganese cations in the B sublattice, may be suppressed by optimizing the \n\nacceptor/donor concentration ratio. The same factor, and minor additions of other transition metal cations \n\nmight be used to increase electronic conductivity and electrochemical activity of the porous SOFC cathodes. \n\nHowever, aliovalent doping with acceptor- and donor-type cations may hardly be expected to suppress the \n\nconductivity drop at low p(O2), which is critical for the anode performance and makes it necessary to \n\nincorporate electronically-conducting components in the porous anodes. \n\n\n\n135 \n \n\n3.2.

Moreover, in accordance with the data on electronic transport \n\nand M\u00f6ssbauer spectra discussed below, the average oxidation state of chromium cations is higher than that \n\nof iron, again decreasing the average size of B-site cations in the perovskite structure. \n\nIn accordance with literature data [178, 191, 212], (La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-? are capable to accommodate \n\nup to ~25 and 50% Sr and Fe, respectively, with preservation of the single phase down to reduced oxygen \n\npressures. Since the phase boundaries of the perovskites with the compositions similar to those studied in the \n\npresent section are located close to the anodic conditions, a discrepancy between the reported data on the \n\nstability are observed, due to minor differences between the experimental conditions, hindered decomposition \n\nkinetics or various sensitivity of the experimental techniques.

This confirms phase \n\nstability of the title perovskites in a wide p(O2) range necessary for the SOFC anode applications. However, \n\nthe structure of (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? under low-p(O2) conditions was identified as orthorhombic (S.G.: \n\nPbnm) originating from an enlargement of Cr cations upon reduction which lowers the symmetry. \n\nThe Mossbauer spectra collected on samples equilibrated under ambient conditions (Fig. 3.21, Table \n\n3.10) show that Fe is present in the perovskite essentially in +3 state and is octahedrally-coordinated with \n\noxygen. This necessitates generation of Cr4+ for charge compensation, while the oxygen content under \n\noxidizing conditions is close to the stoichiometric value, in accordance with TGA studies and the behaviour \n\nof Seebeck coefficients with temperature and p(O2) discussed in the following sections. \n\nOne should note that previous reports on the preferential location of electron holes in \n\n(La,A)(Cr,Fe)O3-?-based perovskites are contradictive. In particular, X-ray photoelectron srectroscopy (XPS) \n\nstudies showed that iron cations in LaCr0.9Fe0.1O3-? and La0.7Ca0.3Cr0.9Fe0.1O3-? remain essentially in +3 state, \n\nanalogously to Fe2O3 [17, 206]. On the other hand, the data on oxygen nonstoichimetry variations with p(O2) \n\nand temperature were analyzed assuming the constant oxidation state of chromium (+3) and \n\ndisproportionation of Fe3+ species [191]. Electronic transport behaviour of La0.33Sr0.67Cr1-xFexO3-? exhibited \n\nfeatures typical to ferrite-based perovskites [179], where multiple oxidation states of Fe may coexist in a \n\nwide p(O2) range [114], although the behaviour of chromites with lower Fe content might be quite different. \n\n \n\n-8 -6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 8\n\n295 K\n\n295 K\n\nx = 0.4\n\nx = 0.4\n\nx = 0.3\n\n(La\n0.75\n\nSr\n0.25\n\n)\n0.95\n\nCr\n1-x\n\nFe\nx\nO\n\n3-? \n\nR\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \ntr\n\nan\nsm\n\nis\nsi\n\non\n \n\nVelocity, mm s\n-1\n\n4\n %\n\nequilibrated at\n\np(O\n2\n)=10\n\n-18\n atm\n\nT=1223 K\n\nequilibrated at\np(O\n\n2\n)=0.21 atm\n\nT=295 K\n\nx = 0.3\n\n4 \n%\n\n \n\n \nFig. 3.21.

It should \n\nbe noticed that similar discrepancies between the literature data with respect to the oxidation states of \n\ntransition metal cations were found for Mn- or Co-doped chromites [10, 113, 164-167, 170]. Regardless of \n\nthe possibility of Fe3+ cations to accept additional holes, most authors report that the average oxidation state \n\nof Cr species exceeds that of Fe [17, 131, 206, 592], consistently with the current results. \n\nUpon reduction iron cations maintain the state +3, but the formation of oxygen vacancies induces \n\nlowering the coordination of Fe3+ down to pentahedral. Fig. 3.22 shows changes of oxygen deficiency on \n\nreduction in a dry 10% H2 - 90% N2 flow, calculated from the TGA results, with respect to the stoichiometry \n\nin atmospheric air. The latter reference point was selected as no complete reduction into phase mixtures with \n\ndefinite oxidation states of iron and chromium cations was achieved during TGA experiments up to 1373 K. \n\nAlthough reduction leads to large nonstoichiometry values, the overall level of oxygen deficiency \n\ncan still be tolerated by the perovskite lattice. Taking into account that iron cations are trivalent, and \n\nassuming ? ? 0  in air for the sake of comparison, the estimated average oxidation state of chromium in dry \n\n10% H2 - 90% N2 tends to asymptotically approach +3.10 for x = 0.3 and +3.01 for x = 0.4 at 1223 K. At \n\n1073 K, these values are +3.16 and +3.14, respectively. Consequently, one may conclude that the redox \n\nbehaviour and electronic conductivity of (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? should be primarily governed by Cr\n3+/4+ \n\nstates in the entire p(O2) range relevant for the electrode applications. \n\nDespite higher reducibility of (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? with enhanced iron content (Fig. 3.22), the \n\nM\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analyses showed no evidence of phase decomposition in \n\nmildly reducing atmospheres. In particular, no traces of metallic iron were detected in the M\u00f6ssbauer spectra \n\nafter reduction at 1223 K and p(O2) = 10\n-18 atm, consistently with XRD results. Taking into account that the \n\nlow-p(O2) stability limits of iron-containing phases usually exhibit van\u2019t Hoff type dependencies on \n\nreciprocal temperature [25, 41, 46, 48], an acceptable thermodynamic stability under anodic conditions in the \n\nintermediate-temperature SOFCs can be expected. Nonetheless, long-term testing is necessary to access \n\nreducibility in pure H2 at 770 - 970 K, since the low-p(O2) decomposition of transition metal-substituted \n\nchromites may be hindered kinetically [8, 10, 17, 171]. \n\n\n\n139 \n \n\n \n\n-20\n\n-16\n\n-12\n\n-8\n\n-4\n\n0\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\n\n-16\n\n-12\n\n-8\n\n-4\n\n0\n\n x=0.3\n x=0.4\n\nair\n\nT=1223 K\n\n10% H\n2\n\n(La\n0.75\n\nSr\n0.25\n\n)\n0.95\n\nCr\n1-x\n\nFe\nx\nO\n\n3-?\n\n?\n?\n\u00d7\n10\n\n2\n\nA\n\nAr\n\nB\n\nTime, h\n\nT=1073 K\n\nFig. 3.22. Variations of the oxygen nonstoichiometry \nof (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? upon reduction in dry \n10% H2 - N2 gas mixture at 1223 K (A) and 1073 K \n(B), calculated from TGA data. The reference points \ncorrespond to atmospheric air at a given temperature. \nThe dashed vertical lines show atmospheric changes. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe data on Mossbauer spectroscopy allow to assess a possibility of formation of ordered structures. \n\nFor hypothetical (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? where all B-site cations are trivalent, the oxygen vacancy \n\nconcentration should correspond to approximately 0.19 sites per formula unit (? ? 0.19). Assuming a random \n\ndistribution of the vacancies, approximately 28% penta- and 5% tetra-coordinated B-sites might be predicted \n\nfrom geometrical consideration. The estimated fractions of penta-coordinated Fe3+ are, however, substantially \n\nhigher (Table 3.10), thus indicating a greater energetic favourability for vacancy location near Fe3+ in \n\ncomparison with Cr3+. Moreover, the calculated concentration of penta-coordinated Fe3+, 0.21 - 0.23 \n\ncations/f.u., is almost independent of x and is close to the vacancy concentration. As the oxygen \n\nnonstoichiometry is low and statistical distribution of Cr/Fe cations in the B sublattice was confirmed by \n\nRietveld refinement of the XRD data, the absence of tetrahedral Fe3+ may originate from coulombic repulsion \n\nbetween the randomly distributed oxygen vacancies. Consequently, the low level of oxygen deficiency, \n\ncomparatively high content of chromium-oxygen polyhedra suppressing the formation of Fe-O-Fe chains as \n\nwell as the incapability of Fe cations to adopt the tetrahedral oxygen coordination in the present composition, \n\nin contrast to the brownmillerite structures, seem responsible for the improved thermodynamic stability of \n\n(La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? in the entire p(O2) range studied. This conclusion is consistent with the results \n\nreported in [169, 179], where the compositions with significantly higher quantities of Sr and Fe atoms \n\nmaintain the disordered perovskite structure. \n\n \n\n\n\n140 \n \n\n3.2.2. Thermal and chemical expansion \n\n \n\nFig. 3.23 presents typical dilatometric curves of (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? ceramics at atmospheric \n\np(O2) and in flowing CO - CO2 mixture where the oxygen partial pressure, continuously controlled by an \n\nelectrochemical oxygen sensor, was 3\u00d710-20 atm at 923 K and 2\u00d710-12 atm at 1223 K. In both cases the \n\nthermal expansion is essentially linear up to 1373 K. When pre-oxidized (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? is heated \n\nin CO - CO2 atmosphere, a significant chemical contribution to the apparent thermal expansion is observed at \n\n970 - 1220 K due to progressive oxygen losses from the perovskite lattice, similar to (La0.75-\n\nxSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr1-xTixO3-?. This effect becomes negligible on cooling back in the same atmosphere, since \n\nthe low oxygen content in the gas phase does not allow to replenish the losses. \n\n \n\n \n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12 A\n\nair\n\n?\nL\n\n/L\n0\u00d7\n\n10\n3\n\n373 573 773 973 1173 1373\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n(La\n0.75\n\nSr\n0.25\n\n)\n0.95\n\nCr\n1-x\n\nFe\nx\nO\n\n3-?\n\nB\n\nheating   cooling\n            x=0.3 \n            x=0.4\n\nT, K \n\nCO/CO\n2\n\nheating/cooling\nrate 3 K/min\n\nFig. 3.23.

The TECs evaluated are close to \n\ndata for Fe-substituted chromites, with iron content is ?50% [163, 212], and are substantially lower compared \n\nto ferrites or Fe- and Sr-rich (La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-? [179, 266], presumably due to the stabilization of Fe\n3+ state, \n\nvalidated by the M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy. \n\nThe values of isothermal expansion caused by reduction of (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? perovskites \n\nin CO-CO2 gas mixtures are presented in Table 3.12. In accordance with the trends exhibited by the oxygen \n\nnonstoichiometry variation, Fe-doping substantially increases the chemically-induced strains, up to ~0.2%. \n\nNote that the apparent lattice expansivity might also be contributed by the \"rhombohedral\" - \"orthorhombic\" \n\nstructural transition occurring on reduction (Fig. 3.20). Nevertheless, the overall level of the chemical \n\nexpansion is modest and comparable with the values for B-site doped chromites reported in literature [194, \n\n235, 237] and shown in Fig. 1.2.7.

On the \n\nother hand, previous reports indicate a promotion of the electronic transfer by Fe doping into chromites [131, \n\n179].

Oxygen partial pressure dependencies of the total conductivity (A, C) and Seebeck coefficient (B, \nD) of (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? ceramics \n\n \n\n \n\n As the oxygen nonstoichiometry variations in oxidizing atmospheres are very minor (Fig. 3.22), the \n\nconductivity and Seebeck coefficient in the high-p(O2) range are essentially independent of the oxygen \n\npressure , as shown in Fig. 3.24. Reduction results in progressive oxygen losses from the perovskite and in \n\ndecreasing Cr4+ concentration, yielding the lower conductivity and higher thermopower. No n-type \n\nconductivity branch typical for Fe-enriched perovskites [179, 217] was observed, although a gradual \n\nlowering of the slope of the conductivity (Fig. 3.24C) and rapid drop of Seebeck coefficient (Fig. 3.24D) for \n\nx = 0.4 occurring on strong reduction might be indicative of a contribution of electronic charge carriers into \n\nthe overall transport mechanism. \n\nThe oxygen permeability measurements were carried out on dense (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? \n\nmembranes exposed to flowing air and H2 - H2O - N2 at the feed and permeate sides, respectively. The results \n\nindicated that  the overall kinetics is governed by the bulk ionic diffusion. Increasing Fe content in perovskite \n\nrenders higher values of the permeation fluxes indicating a promotion of the ionic diffusion by the presence \n\nof iron cations with flexible coordination number. The ionic conductivity estimated in accordance with Eq. \n\n(2.10) varies in the range (5 - 8)\u00d710-2 S\u00d7cm-1 at 1223 K. This level is somewhat lower in comparison with \n\nLa0.33Sr0.67Cr0.33Fe0.67O3-? [179] indicating a positive effect of Sr- or Fe-doping on the oxygen diffusivity due \n\nto increasing the oxygen vacancy concentration and weakening metal-oxygen bonds, provided that no \n\nstructural transformations negatively affecting the ionic transport occur. \n\n \n\n\n\n143 \n \n\n3.2.4.

Characterization of (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? ceramics and electrodes \n \n\nAs demonstrated in previous sections, anode layers based on (La,Sr)(Mn,Cr,Ti)O3-? and \n\n(La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-? oxides suffer from the drop of the electronic conductivity under reducing conditions and \n\nrather low or moderate catalytic activity. In the search of potential alternative anode materials, another \n\napproach of optimization of the electrode performance is undertaken related with intentional introduction of \n\nNi cations into the perovskite structure and subsequent precipitation of catalytically-active metallic phase \n\nunder operation conditions. The choice of the concentration of acceptor-type dopants was selected by such a \n\nway so as to incorporate a slightly higher Ni content in comparison with the solubility limit in reducing \n\natmospheres, without formation of any secondary phases capable to deteriorate the activity, and to avoid a \n\nsubstantial decomposition of the perovskite structure which might negatively influence the transport and \n\nthermomechanical properties. In particular, the cation content in A-sublattice was taken in a slight deficit in \n\ncomparison with that of B-site cations, in order to promote the exsolution of Ni particles and avoid a \n\nseparation of La- or Sr-enriched compounds. \n\nIn LaCrO3-? substituted with only one type of acceptor-type dopants, at least 40 - 50 % of Mg or Ni \n\nmay be dissolved in the perovskite structure [131, 142, 181, 183], while the solubility of Sr is assessed to be \n\nbelow 25% [44, 139, 149]. The simultaneous presence of these cations mutually reduces the solubility limits, \n\nespecially at reduced p(O2) [151, 184, 185, 265], although one may observe some discrepancy between the \n\nreported data. Whatever the trends in the solubility of acceptor-type cations, an excess of Mg and Ni species \n\nin the composition may be considered to be beneficial. Since reduction of (Mg,Ni)O oxide or related \n\ncompounds enables to obtain more dispersed Ni particles in comparison with those produced by reducing \n\nmetallic Ni, as was demonstrated in [578, 579], even in the case of separation of (Mg,Ni)O phase under \n\nambient conditions, subsequent reduction of the mixture is expected to produce an anode with enhanced \n\ncatalytic activity. Taking into account the literature data on the dopant solubility in chromites and a \n\npreferability of a slight excess of Mg and Ni species, the present part is focused on characterization and \n\nevaluation of the electrode activity of (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? perovskite. \n\n \n\n3.3.1.

This phenomenon does not seem to be a drawback, since further \n\nreduction of both the perovskite and the (Mg,Ni)O phase ensures segregation of dispersed  Ni particles. \n\nMoreover, a reasonable oversaturation of the perovskite composition with B-site cations should avoid a \n\n\n\n145 \n \n\nformation of La- or Sr-enriched phases at low p(O2), detrimental in terms of the transport and electrocatalytic \n\nproperties. \n\n \n\n20 40 60 80 100\n\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\n75\n\n100\n(La\n\n0.9\nSr\n\n0.1\n)\n\n0.95\nCr\n\n0.85\nNi\n\n0.05\nMg\n\n0.1\nO\n\n3\n\n2?, \no\n\nIn\nte\n\nns\nit\n\ny \n(\u00d7\n\n10\n3 )\n\n, \na.\n\nu.\n \n\n \n \n\nFig. 3.27.

The bottom line is the difference between the \nobserved and calculated data. The vertical bars correspond to Bragg reflections of the perovskite phase (top) \nand Mg0.4Ni0.6O impurity (bottom). \n\n \n \nFig. 3.28 represents a dilatometric curve of (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? ceramics, obtained in \n\nthe continuous heating regime in air. A drastic change in the expansion behaviour was found at ~370 K, \n\nattributable to a structural transition from the low-temperature orthorhombic perovskite (S.G.: Pnma) to \n\nrhombohedral structure (S.G.: 3R c ) at elevated temperatures. More detailed high-temperature XRD studies \n\npresented in Appendix A confirmed the transition occurring at 350 - 370 K. One should note that the \n\nenlargement of the unit cell volume on heating, calculated from the unit cell parameters of the hexagonal \n\nphase and expressed in the linear scale, reasonably correlates with the expansion measured by dilatometry in \n\nthe corresponding temperature region, as shown in Fig. 3.28. \n\nThe transformation of the crystal lattice is in accordance with numerous reports on the structural \n\nbehaviour of chromite perovskites; in particular, the transition orthorombic - rhombohedral in LaCrO3-? was \n\nfound at 520 - 560 K, shifting to lower temperatures upon Sr doping [112, 131, 183]. The presence of small \n\namounts of Ni in La(Cr,Ni)O3-? extends the domain of existence of the orthorhombic perovskites towards \n\nhigher temperatures [183]. On the other hand, introduction of Ni into La1-xSrxCr1-yNiyO3-? ensures the \n\ntransition of the orthorombic structure into rhombohedral one occurring at x = 0.2 - 0.25 and y = 0.05 - 0.1 \n\nunder ambient conditions, as shown in works [176, 181, 187]. In contrast, introducing Mg elevates the \n\ntransformation temperature [112]. Approximate temperatures corresponding to the structural transformations \n\nof chromite-based materials in air are indicated in Table 3.13. The combined effect of the presence of the \n\nacceptor cations as well as the A-site cation deficiency in the present composition is the shift of the transition \n\ntemperature down to 350 - 370 K. \n\n\n\n146 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 3.28.

Above the transition temperature, the dilatometric curve shows almost linear \n\nbehaviour (Fig. 3.28). For the whole range of oxygen partial pressures studied, the average TECs are \n\nrelatively low and vary in a narrow range (10.2 - 11.7)\u00d710-6 K-1 (Table 3.14). Reduction leads to a decrease \n\nof the expansion coefficient, similar for (La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-? and (La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-? perovskites. \n\n\n\n147 \n \n\nTable 3.14.

Total conductivity and phase relationships on reduction \n\n \nThe total conductivity of (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? is predominantly electronic with electron \n\nholes hopping over B-site cation matrix, and shows the same general trends as (La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-? and \n\n(La,Sr)(Mn,Cr,Ti)O3-? perovskites (Figs. 3.29 - 3.30). However, for Sr-, Mg- and Ni-doped chromites the \n\nlow-p(O2) behaviour, among other common factors, may be influenced by formation of nano-sized Ni \n\nparticles detected by TEM analysis (Fig. 3.31), either precipitated from the perovskite phase or generated by \n\nreduction of the (Mg,Ni)O impurity. In the former case, the process should be accompanied by extensive \n\noxygen losses resulting in a decrease of the concentration of p-type charge carriers accompanied with a drop \n\nof the electronic conductivity and a raise of the Seebeck coefficient. The formation of metallic Ni was \n\nconfirmed by XRD inspection of (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? ceramics, quenched after reduction at \n\np(O2) = 10\n-17 atm at 1223 K. \n\n \n\n-20 -15 -10 -5 0\n\nlog p(O2) (atm)\n\n0.3\n\n0.6\n\n0.9\n\n1.2\n\n1.5\n\nlo\ng \n\n?\n (\n\nS\n/c\n\nm\n)\n\n1223 K\n1173 K\n1123 K\n\n1023 K\n973 K\n\n(La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-?\n\n1/6\n\n1/4\n\n \n\n \n\n-20 -15 -10 -5 0\n\nlog p(O2) (atm)\n\n180\n\n240\n\n300\n\n360\n\n420\n\n?\n, \u00b5\n\nV\n/K\n\n1223 K\n1173 K\n1123 K\n1073 K\n\n(La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-?\n\n \n\nFig. 3.29.

TEM images of (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? annealed in H2-containing atmosphere at 1173 K \n \n\nDue to the segregation of the metallic phase from (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-?, the phase \n\nboundaries of the perovskite are close to those of reduction of NiO into metallic state [41]. This factor \n\nindicates that the conductivity drop for the title composition is primarily associated with Ni segregation, \n\nalthough Ni2+ cations in the perovskite phase are to some extent stabilized in comparison with the simple \n\noxide. Another particularity of (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? relates to comparatively high decomposition \n\nenthalpy, possibly attributable to kinetic stabilization of the phase at lower temperatures. This suggestion is \n\nconsistent with the observation that no conductivity drop was found at the temperatures below 1023 K (Fig. \n\n3.29), which enables to preserve nearly constant total conductivity in the entire p(O2) region studied, \n\nincluding the anodic conditions. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 3.32.

Electrode activity \n\n \n\nThe present section is devoted to consideration of electrode layers (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? \n\napplied onto La10Si5AlO26.5 and LSGM electrolytes preliminary coated with CGO20 sublayer. The effect of \n\nthe presence of the sublayer and detailed characterization of the anode layers is addressed in Chapter 5. \n\n\n\n149 \n \n\n   \n\nA B C \n \nFig. 3.33.

The thickness of the layers varied in the range 50 - 80 \u00b5 m. No substantial \n\nmicrostructural changes were revealed after electrochemical testing the electrodes under reducing or \n\noxidizing conditions, except for formation of agglomerates of catalytically active reagents (CeO2-?, Ni, PrOx) \n\nintroduced during the procedure of the electrochemical testing. \n\nDespite the comparable or even lower level of the total conductivity in oxidative atmospheres, the \n\nperformance of (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? cathodes is significantly better in comparison with \n\n(La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-? and (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-? perovskites (Fig. 3.34), possibly due the presence of buffer layer \n\nin the former case, microstructural peculiarities or participation of (Mg,Ni)O impurity in the electrochemical \n\nprocess, as Ni-containing phases possess an enhanced catalytic activity towards redox processes [578, 593]. \n\n \n\n0 15 30 45 60\n\n|i|, mA/cm2\n\n40\n\n120\n\n200\n\n280\n\n|?\n|, \n\nm\nV\n\n50\n\n200\n\n350\n\n500\n\n0 30 60 90 120\n\n4 10 16 22\n\n4 12 20 28 36 44\n\n40\n\n120\n\n200\n\n280\n\n|?\n|, \n\nm\nV\n\n50\n\n200\n\n350\n\n500\ncathodic current\n\n(La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-?\n(La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-?\nmodified with PrO\n\nx\n\n(La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5O3-?\n\nanodic current\n(La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-?\n(La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-?\nmodified with PrO\n\nx\n\n(La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5O3-?\n\nelectrolyte: LSGM electrolyte: La\n10\n\nSi\n5\nAlO\n\n26.5\n\n1073 K 1073 K\n\n973 K 973 K\n\np(O\n2\n)=0.21 atm p(O\n\n2\n)=0.21 atm\n\nA B\n\nC D\n\nelectrolyte: La\n10\n\nSi\n5\nAlO\n\n26.5\n\np(O\n2\n)=0.21 atm\n\nelectrolyte: LSGM\n\np(O\n2\n)=0.21 atm\n\n \n \n\nFig. 3.34.

Similar to (La,Sr)(Mn,Cr,Ti)O3-? cathodes, the polarization resistances may be substantially \n\nreduced by distribution of PrOx phase over the electrode layer, possibly attributable to insufficient activity of \n\nthe non-modified perovskite phase or microstructure-related improvements. Another particularity of the title \n\ncathodes is rather similar polarization behaviour under cathodic and anodic currents; the trend becomes more \n\nobvious after addition of PrOx (Fig. 3.34). As discussed in previous sections, for (La,Sr)(Mn,Cr,Ti)O3-? \n\ncathodes deposited directly onto the gallate or silicate electrolytes, the anodic polarization is substantially \n\nlower in comparison with cathodic one, presumably due to dissolution of transition metal cations in the \n\nelectrolyte and their influence on the transport characteristics of the latter. In turn, this effect may be \n\ngoverned by current-induced oxidation or reduction of the cations dissolved. The presence of the sublayer in \n\nthe present case seems to suppress the cation interdiffusion. While (La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? cathodes \n\napplied directly onto apatite electrolyte showed substantially larger polarization values under cathodic \n\npolarization, presumably due to formation of additional interstitial oxygen species and promotion of the ionic \n\ntransport of the apatite phase, for Sr-, Mg- and Ni-doped chromite cathode with CGO20 sublayer the effect of \n\nthe current direction is less obvious. One should not also neglect a possible direct participation of the ceria-\n\nbased phase in the electrochemical process with resultant influence on the electrode mechanism, an \n\nenlargement of the TPB or minor current-induced microstructural changes. \n\nApart from the low activity found for cathodes on apatite-type electrolyte, these cells also suffer \n\nfrom a noticeable degradation, as shown in Fig. 3.35. No observable performance loss was found for similar \n\ncathodes deposited onto gallate electrolytes, although longer testing is necessary for certain conclusions. As \n\nindicated in [566, 580, 594], the apatite phases are prone to segregation of silica and its subsequent spreading \n\nalong the interfaces or TPB, while the electrolyte material suffers from a degradation of the transport and \n\nmechanical properties. \n\n0 10 20 30 40\n\nt, hours\n\n100\n\n125\n\n150\n\n175\n\n?\n?\n\n, m\nV\n\n1\n\n3\n\n5\n\n7\n\nR\n?\n, O\n\nhm\n<\n\ncm\n2\n\n-2\n\n2\n\n6\n\n10\n\n?\nR\n\no\nhm\n\n/R\noh\n\nm\n, %\n\nelectrolyte:\nLa10Si5AlO26.5 (1023 K, -30 mA/cm\n\n2)\n\nLSGM (973 K, -60 mA/cm2)\n\ncathode: (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-?-PrOx\nsublayer: Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-?\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\n \n\nFig. 3.35.

The data were collected in galvanostatic mode. \n\n\n\n151 \n \n\nFig. 3.36 shows typical impedance spectra collected for a cathode (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? \n\nin contact with LSGM electrolyte. The impedance arc related to the electrode process is dominated by the \n\nprocess characterized by the frequency domain 0.1 - 100 Hz; the corresponding resistance decreases upon \n\ncathodic or anodic polarization. One may observe an additional small semicircle at higher frequencies which \n\nseems to grow under anodic currents. Whatever the contributions into the overall electrode mechanism, the \n\npolarization resistances evaluated from the impedance spectra are consistent with those found from the slope \n\nof the polarization curves, as shown in Fig. 3.37. More detailed analysis of the impedance data is problematic \n\ndue to poor resolution between the impedance arcs as well as by complexity to prepare identical electrode \n\nlayers with a good reproducibility of the impedance characteristics by the procedure undertaken in the \n\npresent study. One should emphasize that no optimization of the electrode fabrication route was attempted \n\nhere, since the primarily task of the work is related with revealing the relationships between the composition, \n\nfunctional characteristics and performance-determining factors of perovskite-based electrodes.  \n\nThe polarization resistance of (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? cathodes on LSGM electrolyte \n\nvaries in the range 1- 3 Ohm\u00d7cm2 at 1073 K. Although the performance may further be improved by PrOx \n\nintroduction, the overall level of the electrochemical performance is insufficient for the practical utilizations \n\nunder oxidizing conditions. \n\nAnother concern related with the applicability of Cr-enriched materials as cathodes is a strong \n\nvaporization of Cr-containing volatile species [82-85] and formation of multivalent chromium-based \n\ncompounds on the perovskite surface [44, 139], promoted by high oxygen pressure in the cathodic \n\natmosphere. The latter problem becomes even more critical in water vapour-containing environments; \n\ntherefore, a special equipment is required for preliminary drying of oxidizing gases in order to operate with \n\nchromite-based cathodes, which increases the costs and complexity of the electrochemical devices. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 3.36.

Final remarks on chromite-based electrode materials \n\n \n\nIn the present section three various series of doped chromites were characterized as potential \n\nelectrode materials. The choice of the compositions was primarily based on a possible modification of the \n\nionic transport and catalytic activity induced by appropriate doping in A- and B-sublattice with simultaneous \n\npreservation of the chemical and thermomechanical stability as well as of an acceptable level of the total \n\nconductivity in a wide p(O2) range. Moreover, the amounts of B-site cation dopants were selected as high as \n\npossible (i.e. at the limit of phase stability) in order to diminish Cr content and avoid the contamination of the \n\ncell components induced by chromium diffusion, vaporization/deposition, etc. \n\nIn accordance with literature reports and results shown in the work, most chromites exhibit \n\nstructural transformations upon thermal or redox cycling; selected examples are demonstrated in Fig. 3.28 \n\nand Table 3.13. Although no influence of the transition on the integrity of ceramics or electrode layers was \n\ndetected, in the case of long-term utilization one should take into account that the electrochemical cell may \n\nbe exposed to multiple thermal or redox cycles. In accordance with [169, 177], reduction-induced transitions \n\nin chromites basically proceed slowly, without any noticeable effects on the overall expansion behaviour. If \n\nthe issue of the structural transitions cannot be avoided it would be reasonable to focus further efforts on the \n\nachieving more gradual transformations to prevent mechanical damages. On the other hand, slow structural \n\nrearrangements may be accompanied by hindered equilibration of the transport and dimensional properties \n\nand resultant negative influence on the functional characteristics of the materials. \n\nThe surface-related processes, presence of the secondary phases, structural transformations, slow \n\nequilibration kinetics in the intermediate-p(O2) range result in hysteresis behaviour of the conductivity \n\nobservable on the chromite-based materials upon consecutive reduction and oxidation runs (Fig. 3.39). \n\n \n\n \n\n-20 -15 -10 -5 0\n\nlog p(O2) (atm)\n\n0.0\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n1.2\n\n1.6\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\nlo\ng \n\n?\n (\n\nS\n/c\n\nm\n)\n\n(La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-?\n(La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-?\n\n(La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-?\n(La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr0.7Fe0.3O3-?\n\n7\n\n$\n\n:\n\n+\n\n1223 K\n\n1123 K\n\nA\n\nB\n\n \n\nFig. 3.39.

Arrows \nindicate the direction of p(O2) variations. \n\n\n\n154 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nNevertheless, no strong degradation upon redox cycling was observed, as indicated by \n\ncomparatively small deviations between the reduction and oxidation curves, while the initial level of the \n\nconductivity was nearly recovered after a cycle. Such a behaviour is consistent with high chemical and \n\nthermomechanical stability of chromites in a wide p(O2) region and may be regarded to be beneficial \n\ncompared with (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-? perovskites where the hysteresis is more substantial and the conductivity \n\nshows a drastic drop after redox cycling, possibly associated with mechanical failure of the materials. \n\nOne of the major problems associated with the processing of Cr-enriched electrode materials relates \n\nto the strong tendency of chromites towards surface oxidation under ambient conditions [44, 132, 137, 138]. \n\nFig. 3.40 represents heating behaviour of selected Cr-containing perovskites studied in the present work. One \n\nmay observe that the most substantial mass changes originating from release of adsorbed oxygen, H2O or \n\nCO2 gaseous species and resultant strong hysteresis on thermal cycling are relevant to the materials with \n\nhigher Cr content indicating that these perovskites are more susceptible towards chemical changes at low \n\ntemperatures in atmospheric air. In terms of the anode applications, the phenomena indicated may induce \n\nmechanical failure or loss of activity due to cation redistribution over the material, microstructural \n\ndegradation, changes in the surface properties, etc. This requires a stringent control of the cell operation \n\nprocedure and the ambient conditions surrounding the chromite-based anodes. One should note that \n\nvariations of the chemical state of the surface are also typical for Ti-enriched compositions; an example is \n\ndemonstrated in Fig. 3.40A. \n\n \n \n\n373 573 773 973 1173 1373\n\n-1,6\n\n-1,2\n\n-0,8\n\n-0,4\n\n0,0\n\n?\nm\n\n/m\n0\n<\n\n10\n3\n\n(La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5O3-?\n(La0.55Sr0.45)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.3Ti0.2O3-?\n(La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-?\n(La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-?\n\np(O2)=0.21 atm\n\n373 573 773 973 1173 1373\n\nT, K\n\n-1,6\n\n-1,2\n\n-0,8\n\n-0,4\n\n0,0\n\nA\n\nB\n\n \n\nFig. 3.40.

Furthermore, the intrinsic \n\nelectrocatalytic activity of chromites is rather low unless improved by additional components which also \n\nrequires introduction of cations which facilitate the ionic transport and exchange kinetics. However, the \n\nresults of electrochemical testing showed that reduction of Cr content in (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-? \n\nand (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? leads to lower anode activity, possibly due to suppressed electronic transport \n\n(Fig. 3.16 and Fig. 3.26). Therefore, one should find a compromise between the positive effects (oxygen \n\ndiffusivity, catalytic properties, suppression of the formation of high-valent chromium species) and possible \n\ndisadvantages (worse chemical and thermomechanical stability and promotion of the conductivity drop) \n\ncaused by the presence of acceptor-type and/or transition metal dopants the perovskite phase. To some \n\nextent, promising combinations of the functional characteristics were demonstrated for (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-\n\nxFexO3-? and (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? at reduced temperatures (Fig. 3.26, Fig. 3.38); as a result, \n\nthese groups of anode materials showed the highest potential for further studies which should primarily \n\ninclude the stability of the electrochemical characteristics, since the nearly constant level of the electronic \n\nconductivity seems to be associated with kinetic factors. \n\nAlthough chromite-based compositions are not generally considered as SOFC cathode components \n\ndue to insufficient activity towards oxygen reduction [587, 595], selected characteristics obtained for \n\ncathodes (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-? and (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? may have an impact on \n\ndevelopment of the electrodes for fabrication of symmetrical electrochemical cells. However, the level of the \n\npolarization resistances of 1 - 3 Ohm\u00d7cm2 is too high with respect to the requirements for cathode materials, \n\nwhile the problems related with poor chemical stability and contamination of cell components with \n\nchromium species necessitate reducing Cr content and make the issue of cathode applications of chromites \n\narguable. \n\n\n\n156 \n \n\nChapter 4. Transport, thermomechanical and electrochemical properties of \n\nmanganite-based perovskites  \n\n \n\nAs discussed in Chapter 1.3, recent studies on doped manganites revealed a proper combination of \n\nthe transport properties and catalytic activity, while the main drawbacks associated with insufficient tolerance \n\ntowards reductive conditions may be overcome by kinetic stabilization or replacement of Mn with an \n\nappropriate amount of high-valent cations [8, 16, 95, 306, 317]. In particular, among chromite- and titanate-\n\nbased anodes, promising characteristics have been found for (La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-? and (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-? \n\ncompositions, while increasing Mn content in these groups of perovskites was shown to be beneficial in \n\nterms of the electrocatalytic properties [16, 210, 352]. \n\nOne of the most crucial issues related with application of manganites in reducing atmospheres is that \n\nstabilization of the perovskite structure by an appropriate B-site substitution basically causes a deterioration \n\nof the transport properties and electrode activity (see, in particular, Table 1.3.2). As a result, the optimum \n\ncombination of the functional characteristics was in most cases found for manganites with minimum \n\nsubstitution degree in B-sublattice [95, 210, 306], despite the facilitated oxygen losses and promoted drop of \n\nthe conductivity. However, the insufficient thermodynamic stability may induce degradation of the \n\nperformance in long-term scale, mechanical damage, etc. Therefore, doping strategies should satisfy the \n\nfollowing requirements: 1. the sufficient electronic conduction and acceptable electrocatalytic activity \n\nrelevant to manganites should be preserved; 2. the domain of p(O2) where the functional characteristics are \n\nmaintained should be expanded. \n\nDespite a large potential of manganite-based anodes, the number of studies devoted to their \n\napplicability under reducing conditions is scarce in comparison with chromite or titanate perovskites. The \n\npresent section is focused on evaluation of phase, structural, microstructural, thermomechanical, transport \n\nand electrochemical behaviour of A(Mn,Nb)O3-? (A = Ca, Sr) and (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-? perovskites. \n\n \n\n4.1. Perovskite-like SrMn1-xNbxO3-? and CaMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? \n\n \n\nNb-doping into perovskites has been regarded as an effective way to stabilize the perovskite \n\nstructure or expand the phase boundaries of perovskites towards more reductive conditions [20, 130, 596]. \n\nDue to extremely low reduction potential, any contribution of Nb5+/4+ couple into the overall electronic \n\nconductivity may hardly be expected; however, donor-doping into CaMnO3-? and SrMnO3-? is favourable in \n\nterms of excitation of additional n-type carriers. On the other hand, high Nb amount reduces the population \n\nof available sites for electronic transport. In the case of large overall content of donor-like cations in the \n\ncompound, an excess of cation vacancies may be required for the charge compensation which may provoke a \n\ntransformation of the perovskite lattice into ordered structures. To avoid such a possibility, manganites \n\nCaMnO3-? and SrMnO3-? were selected as parent compositions for assessment of the effect of Nb-doping. \n\nDepending on the oxygen deficiency which may achieve 0.5 per perovskite formula unit, CaMnO3-? \n\nexists in orthorhombic, tetragonal or cubic structure; the symmetry is higher for oxygen-deficient \n\n\n\n157 \n \n\ncompositions [597-599]. As reported by Kruth et al. [600], up to 60% Nb may be introduced into B-sublattice \n\nof CaMnO3-?; further Nb-doping induces separation of Ca2Nb2O7-based phases. The orthorhombic lattice \n\nsymmetry is generally preserved upon doping provided that the oxygen deficiency is below 0.2 [600]. No \n\ncation ordering in Ca(Mn,Nb)O3-? has been observed [600-602], while at low Nb doping level as well as in \n\nparent CaMnO3-? formation of oxygen vacancy-ordered superstructures on reduction was reported [600]. The \n\nlatter information is, however, contradictive [597-600]. The orthorhombic perovskite structure with cation \n\ndisorder has also been reported for Ta- or Sb-substituted CaMnO3-? [601-603]. The studies on Ca(Mn,Nb)O3-? \n\nconcerned mainly their structural characteristics, phase relationships, oxygen nonstoichiometry and low-\n\ntemperature magnetic and transport properties, while reports on their properties with respect to high-\n\ntemperature electrochemical applications have not been found. \n\nThe perovskite structure of SrMnO3-? is stable only at the temperatures above ~1310 K in air; the \n\ncrystal symmetry is cubic or orthorhombic symmetry depending on the oxygen content [330, 604]. On \n\ncooling the lattice adopts four-layers hexagonal structure. In order to stabilize the perovskite lattice, the \n\ncomposition is basically doped with donor-like cations; in particular, introducing 10 - 30% of Ce into A-\n\nsublattice was shown to be beneficial for preserving the structure and improving the transport properties \n\n[330, 605]. Similar effects might be expected for doping with Nb. At the same time, the reports on the \n\nstructural behaviour of Nb-doped SrMnO3-? are contradictive. No indication of cation ordering have been \n\nreported by Lufaso et al. [601, 602], based on neutron diffraction studies. On the other hand, in [19, 20] the \n\nstructure was identified as cubic perovskite with ordering in B-sublattice. Reduction causes transformation \n\ninto disordered cubic structure, while the perovskite phase was shown to be stable in 5% H2 - Ar. The \n\nconductivity, however, is rather low, which, in particular, yielded poor cathodic performance [591]. \n\nThe present section is devoted to evaluation of the effect of A-site cation nature and Mn:Nb atomic \n\nratio on the structural, microstructural, transport and thermomechanical properties of A(Mn,Nb)O3-? \n\nperovskites. \n\n \n\n4.1.1. Phase relationships and structure \n\n \n\nSrMn1-xNbxO3-? with x = 0.2 - 0.5 are single phase perovskites after preparation in air (Fig. 4.1). For \n\nx = 0.4, the structure was identified as rhombohedral ( c3R ), while the compositions with x = 0.2 and x = 0.5 \n\nwere refined in cubic symmetry (Table 4.1), although the space groups were identified to be different due to \n\npossible B-site ordering for Nb-enriched perovskite. As found by Tao et al [20], ordering between Mn and \n\nNb cations taking place in SrMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? under oxidizing conditions may be detected by the appearance of \n\na characteristic peak at 2? ? 37.6\u00ba in XRD pattern. The same peak was found in the present work (inset in the \n\nupper pattern in Fig. 4.1) which disappears upon reduction indicating a possible cation disordering. The \n\nordered perovskite structures have also been reported for relative compositions, namely for SrMn0.5Sb0.5O3-? \n\n[606] and to some extent for SrMn0.5Ta0.5O3-? [606]. Although more accurate techniques than XRD are \n\nrequired to detect the formation of superstructures, in the present work the structures of SrMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? \n\nprepared in air and after annealing in 10% H2 - N2 were refined with space group Fm3m  and Pm3m , \n\n\n\n158 \n \n\nrespectively (Table 4.1). One should separately note that no accent on the structural characteristics was made \n\nin this study. This, in particular, is related with the fact that by far no obvious benefit or disadvantage of the \n\ncation ordering on the electrochemical characteristics of perovskites has been reported, as both ordered and \n\ndisordered structures have shown a potential for the electrode applications [8, 16, 126, 129]. \n\nAnalyzing the behaviour of the cell parameters indicated in Table 4.1, Nb-doping expands the cell \n\nvolume, referred to the primitive cubic perovskite cell. This trend is expectable, since the ionic radius of Nb5+ \n\nis larger in comparison with Mn4+ (0.64 vs. 0.53 \u00c5) which dominates in the perovskite lattice of the parent \n\nSrMnO3-?. Moreover, introduction of the donor-type cation should induce reducing the oxidation state of Mn \n\nspecies; the cation radius of Mn3+ is 0.645 \u00c5, also larger in comparison with Mn4+. The ionic radii are given \n\nassuming the octahedral coordination for all the atoms and high-spin state for Mn3+ [133]. A similar increase \n\nof the cell parameters in orthorhombic settings on Nb doping was observed for Ca(Mn,Nb)O3-? series [600]. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFig. 4.1.

One may observe a \n\nsimilarity between the parameters obtained for the powders quenched or cooled with the rate of 5 K/min in \n\nair from the same temperature demonstrating that the rate indicated is too rapid for achieving the equilibrium. \n\nNevertheless, the variations of the cell parameters upon moderate reduction is not high; in particular, \n\nexposure of CaMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? to Ar atmosphere with subsequent quenching causes a ~0.3% increase of the \n\ncell volume. \n\n \n\n4.1.2. Thermal expansion \n\n \n\nNb-doping into SrMnO3-? reduces the thermal expansion, as shown in Fig. 4.5 and Table 4.4. This \n\ntrend is opposite to the behaviour of the cell volume on variation of Nb content calculated at room \n\ntemperature (Table 4.1), and might primarily originate from suppressed oxygen losses on thermal cycling and \n\nresultant decrease of the chemical contribution into the entire expansion for Nb-enriched materials. The latter \n\nsuggestion is confirmed by an increase of the expansivity on heating (Table 4.4), more pronounced for the \n\nSrMn0.8Nb0.2O3-?, while the perovskites with higher Nb concentration show nearly linear behaviour. \n\nIf considering the entire temperature interval studied, replacement of Ca for Sr decreases the \n\naverage TEC originating from smaller ionic radius of Ca or structural particularities. More detailed analysis \n\nshows that the expansion in the high-temperature range is substantially enhanced for CaMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? and \n\novercomes the TEC value for Sr-containing analogue, as shown in Fig. 4.5 and Table. 4.4.  \n\n\n\n163 \n \n\nFig. 4.5.

In terms of the thermal expansion behaviour, the materials SrMn1-xNbxO3-?

In particular, SrMn0.8Nb0.2O3-? shows comparatively large oxygen losses (up to \n\n0.015 per perovskite formula unit) above 1000 K; this temperature is close to the point where a pronounced \n\nenhancement of the TEC takes place (Fig. 4.5). CaMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? also demonstrates an obvious extensive \n\nhigh-temperature oxygen release, unlike Sr-containing analogue, which also correlates with the dilatometric \n\ncurves. Analyzing the behaviour of CaMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? ceramics, one should note a strong hysteresis \n\nobservable on thermal cycling, and poor reproducibility of the results on subsequent heating and cooling runs \n\n(Fig. 4.7). The mass changes obtained by TGA (Fig. 4.8) are affected by cooling rate, while the equilibration \n\nof the mass in TGA tests was not achieved for more than 20 hours (inset in Fig. 4.8). \n\n \n\n273 473 673 873 1073 1273\n\nT, K\n\n0\n\n0,4\n\n0,8\n\n1,2\n\n1,6\n\nL\n/L\n\n0\n, \n%\n\nSrMn\n0.5\n\nNb\n0.5\n\nO\n3-\n\nheating\n\ncooling\n\nCaMn\n0.5\n\nNb\n0.5\n\nO\n3-\n\n1st cycle\n\n2nd cycle\n\np(O\n2\n) = 0.21 atm\n\n \n\nFig. 4.7.

Inset shows equilibration of the oxygen \nnonstoichiometry in air at 1273 K. \n\n \n \n \n\nIn accordance with the data reported in [600], the transformation of the orthorhombic structure of \n\nCaMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? into cubic was found when ? exceeds 0.2 - 0.25. Assuming the preservation of the single \n\nperovskite phase, the transition should occur when the fraction of Mn2+ species approaches the total amount \n\nof manganese cations, and further oxygen losses from the cubic phase should induce reduction of Nb5+ or \n\nMn2+ species. Whatever the origin of the structural rearrangement, in the present study the variations in \n\noxygen content in CaMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? in air are found to be much smaller, which should exclude any \n\npossibility of this transformation. XRD analysis carried out on quenched materials after annealing in air or Ar \n\nrevealed no significant structural changes except for the increase of the lattice parameters. Nevertheless, \n\ntaking into account the results of the thermal analysis as well as the slow equilibration kinetics, formation of \n\ndomains with cubic or other symmetry might be expected, which content is below the sensitivity of XRD \n\n\n\n165 \n \n\ntechnique. The increase of the cell volume (Table 4.3) confirms the suggestion that the structural variations \n\nare induced by oxygen losses. However, further studies are required for elucidation the factors responsible \n\nfor the slow kinetics in CaMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? material.  \n\n \n\n4.1.3. Total conductivity \n\n \n\nConsidering the previous reports on the electronic transport in manganites of alkali-earth cations, the \n\nparent compositions SrMnO3-? and CaMnO3-? and their derivatives exhibit polaronic character of the \n\nconductivity with dominant n-type charge carriers, although the binding energy of mobile polarons is \n\ncomparatively small which may induce metallic-like behaviour [330, 583, 595, 608]. The mobile electrons \n\nare localized on Mn species, and the concentration of the charge carriers may be quantitatively described via \n\n3-fold charged manganese cations. Generation of Mn3+ is associated with oxygen losses from the perovskite \n\nstructure; the process corresponds to electron transition from half-filled t2g band to the eg band and may cause \n\ncomparatively high electron mobility due to a minor occupancy of the latter. \n\nDonor-doping is regarded as another way to increase the concentration of n-type charge carriers. In \n\nparticular, Ce-doping into A-sublattice of SrMnO3-? was shown to promote the electronic transport in the \n\nentire solubility domain, although the improvement might also be related with stabilization of the perovskite \n\nstructure. Appearance of regions with substantially reduced activation energy or even metallic-like \n\ntemperature dependence of the conductivity has been reported for SrMnO3-? [609, 610], (La,Sr)MnO3-? [323, \n\n583] or (Sr,Ce)MnO3-?-based compositions [320, 330, 605], indicative of possible broadband character of the \n\nelectronic transfer, although the trends might also be attributed to structural transformations or extensive \n\noxygen losses affecting the concentration of mobile charge carriers. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 4.9. Temperature dependencies of the total \nconductivity of SrMn1-xNbxO3-? and CaMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? \nceramics in air. Data on the conductivity of \nSrMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? [330] and SrMnO3-? [20] are given for \ncomparison. \n\n\n\n166 \n \n\nAs shown in Fig. 4.9, moderate Nb-doping (up to 20 mol.%) significantly improves the conductivity \n\nof SrMnO3-?, originating from generation of electrons via Nb introduction. The latter effect is qualitatively \n\nsimilar to Ce-doping into SrMnO3-? [330], although higher lattice symmetry in comparison with the \n\nhexagonal SrMnO3-? phase may also contribute to faster electronic transport. On further substitution with Nb, \n\nthe conductivity substantially drops with simultaneous enhancement of the activation energy, as shown in \n\nTable 4.5. CaMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? and SrMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? exhibit nearly equal conductivity in the high-temperature \n\ninterval, but the former perovskite is characterized by enhanced activation energy, possibly due to lower \n\nstructural symmetry. \n\n \n \nTable 4.6.

In particular, large negative \n\nSeebeck coefficients observable for SrMnO3-?, (Sr,Ce)MnO3-? or CaMnO3-? [330, 598, 611] become close to \n\nzero for SrMn0.6Nb0.4O3-? with subsequent inversion of the negative sign (Fig. 4.10). Analogously with \n\n(La,Sr)(Mn,Cr,Ti)O3-? system, this situation may correspond to reduction of the amount of p-type charge \n\ncarriers below 50% of the overall density of states upon Nb-doping, as shown in Fig. 4.11; the values p/N and \n\n\u00b5 p were calculated using Eqs. (2.3) and (2.5) described in Chapter 2, assuming N equal to the overall amount \n\nof Mn species in the B sublattice. \n\nHeating induces generation of additional p-type charge carriers; this effect is more pronounced for \n\nSrMn0.6Nb0.4O3-?. Taking into account relatively small variations of the oxygen content (Fig. 4.6), the \n\ntemperature effect might be primarily attributed to promotion of Mn3+ disproportionation. On the other hand, \n\nvariations of the population of p-type carriers with temperature are rather small, as can be evaluated from the \n\nsimilarity of the activation energies of the total conductivity and hole mobility (Table 4.5). \n\nSubstitution of Nb for Mn in Sr(Mn,Nb)O3-? substantially decreases the hole mobility and increases \n\nthe corresponding activation energy. This indicates that apart from diminishing the amount of mobile \n\ncarriers, the presence of inert Nb cations in the perovskite lattice hampers the electronic transfer, analogously \n\nwith the trends observed in numerous perovskite systems [111, 306, 320, 596]. \n\n\n\n167 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n973 1073 1173 1273\n\nT, K\n\n-30\n\n-15\n\n0\n\n15\n\n?\n, \u00b5\n\nV\n\u00d7\n\nK\n-1\n\n0.48\n\n0.51\n\n0.54\n\n0.57\n\np\n/N\n\n-2.5\n\n-2.2\n\n-1.9\n\n-1.6\n\nlo\ng \n\n\u00b5\np \n\n(c\nm\n\n2 \u00d7\ns-\n\n1 \u00d7\nV\n\n-1\n)\n\nSrMn0.6Nb0.4O3-?\nSrMn0.5Nb0.5O3-?\n\nA\n\nB\n\np(O2) = 0.21 atm\n\n,\n\n/\n\n \n\nFig. 4.10.

On stronger reduction, the conductivity decreases, as demonstrated in Fig. 4.12. \n\nSimilar trends have been observed for most manganite-based perovskites stable in a wide p(O2) range, \n\nincluding SrMn1-xNbxO3-? (x = 0.5 - 0.6) studied in [19, 20], although the conductivity obtained in the present \n\nstudy is ~3 times higher in comparison with the previously reported data. The conductivity and Seebeck \n\ncoefficient show hysteresis behaviour on redox cycling; however, the characteristics are reversible which \n\nshows that no mechanical degradation occurs on p(O2) variations and the equilibration of SrMn1-xNbxO3-? \n\nceramics takes place in a reasonable period. \n\n \n \n4.1.4. Oxygen permeability \n\n \nThe level and basic trends of the parameters responsible for the oxygen ionic transport in Nb-doped  \n\nSrMnO3-? ceramics were qualitatively assessed by comparison of the permeation fluxes j and specific oxygen \n\npermeability J(O2) through dense ceramics of SrMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? with the thickness of 0.60 and 1.00 mm. The \n\nbehaviour of the permeability characteristics on changing the membrane thickness demonstrated in Fig. 4.13 \n\nassumes that the oxygen flux is limited by both bulk oxygen diffusion and surface exchange kinetics, similar \n\nto (La,Sr)(Mn,Cr,Ti)O3-? series and numerous chromite and manganite perovskites [252, 337, 338]. The \n\nactivation energy of the fluxes under fixed gradient of the oxygen chemical potential is as high as ~230 \n\nkJ/mol, close to the values found for Sr, Ti-doped (La,Sr)(Mn,Cr)O3-? ceramics, as shown in Table 3.7. \n\nThe effect of the surface exchange limitations over SrMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? is especially pronounced at \n\nelevated temperatures, where decreasing the membrane thickness has a minor influence on the permeation \n\nfluxes. Subsequent cooling induces an enhancement of the difference between the fluxes for various \n\nthicknesses which assumes that the activation energy of the ionic diffusion is higher in comparison with the \n\ngas/solid exchange kinetics. In the family (La,Sr)(Mn,Cr,Ti)O3-? as well as in perovskites characterized by \n\nslow ionic transport and hampered equilibration kinetics, the oxygen diffusion was shown to be strongly \n\ncontributed by the diffusion along grain boundaries [112, 254, 336, 339]; a similar behaviour may be \n\nsuggested for SrMn0.5Nb0.5O3-?. \n\nNb-doped SrMnO3-? shows some improvement in comparison with (La,Sr)(Mn,Cr,Ti)O3-? series in \n\nterms of oxygen diffusivity, as demonstrated by 2-fold increase in the permeation fluxes, shown in Fig. 4.14. \n\nUsing the model described in Chapter 2 (Eq. (2.11)), the oxygen ionic conductivity was estimated to be as \n\nlow as 10-4 - 10-3 S/cm in the temperature interval studied, although any certain calculation is complicated by \n\nlow values of the permeation fluxes and resultant large errors of the estimation. This level of ionic \n\nconductivity and the slow surface rates are too low to expect any extension of the electrochemical zone into \n\nthe bulk phase of the materials studied. In particular, analogous measurements on (Sr,Ce)MnO3-? and \n\n(Sr,Ce)(Mn,Al)O3-? membranes as well as conductivity studies on SrFe0.6Nb0.4O3-? ceramics revealed the \n\nionic conductivity ~1 order of magnitude higher in comparison with SrMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? [320, 596, 605]. The \n\nresults indicate a negative influence of excessive Nb content on the ionic transfer, in accordance with a minor \n\nlevel of the oxygen vacancies (Fig. 4.6) and their reduced mobility in the vicinity of Nb atoms [596]. \n\n\n\n169 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 4.13.

Electrode behaviour \n\n \n\nAs shown in previous sections, the level of the electronic and ionic conductivity in SrMn1-xNbxO3-? \n\n(x = 0.4 - 0.5) is rather low to expect any noticeable electrochemical performance. Indeed, the electrode \n\nactivity was evaluated to be poor under both oxidizing and reducing conditions. For example, the polarization \n\nresistance of the manganites in contact with LSGM electrolyte without especial modifications was evaluated \n\nin the range 10 - 20 Ohm\u00d7cm2. Decreasing Nb content slightly improves the anode performance, in \n\naccordance with the electronic conductivity behaviour. \n\nPolarization curves for SrMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? anode shown in Fig. 4.15 exhibit a slight improvement of \n\nthe activity upon redox cycling. Possible origins this phenomenon as well analogues in literature will be \n\ndiscussed in Chapter 4.2.5 devoted to (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-? anodes. One of likely activation mechanisms \n\ninvolves current-induced microstructural variations; however, for Nb-doped SrMnO3-? the decrease in the \n\npolarization resistance is within 15 - 20% and microscopic analysis (Fig. 4.16) does not allow to observe any \n\nobvious difference between the microstructures of the electrode layers before and after current application, \n\nboth in cathodic and anodic direction. Selected approaches towards reduction of the polarization resistance of \n\nSrMn1-xNbxO3-? anodes involving, in particular, surface modifications or optimization of the half-cell \n\ncomposition, are considered in Chapter 5. \n\n\n\n170 \n \n\n \n\n2 6 10 14\n\ni, mA/cm2\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n?\n, m\n\nV\n\nsample 1\ncycle 1\ncycle 2 \n(after 20 hours)\n\ncycle 3 \n(after 30 hours)\n\nsample 2\n\n3 9 15 21\nZ', Ohm<cm2\n\n2\n\n6\n\n10\n\n-Z\n\",\n\n O\nhm\n\n<\ncm\n\n2\n\nSrMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? | LSGM\n\n1073 K\n\n10% H2-N2-H2O\n\ni=0\n\n \nFig. 4.15.

In particular, the overpotential of non-modified SrMn0.6Nb0.4O3-? electrode on LSGM and \n\nLa10Si5AlO26.5 electrolyte under the cathodic current of 25 mA/cm\n2 achieves ~140 and ~410 Ohm\u00d7cm2 at \n\n1073 K, respectively. Corresponding values for (La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? cathode achieve ~250 and >500 \n\nOhm\u00d7cm2, respectively. Taking into account a comparable level of the total conductivity of SrMn0.6Nb0.4O3-? \n\nperovskites in oxidizing atmospheres, the improvement might be attributed to slightly higher content of Mn \n\nspecies in comparison with (La,Sr)(Mn,Cr,Ti)O3-? series which are responsible for the cathode activity [210, \n\n324, 584]; another possibility relates to ionic transport which is estimated to be slightly better in SrMn1-\n\nxNbxO3-? perovskites, as discussed in Chapter 4.1.4. \n\nSummarizing the general trends shown by the polarization curves under oxidizing atmospheres, one \n\nmay emphasize the influence of the electrolyte nature and the presence of protective sublayer on both the \n\nlevel of the polarization resistance and on behaviour under cathodic and anodic polarization. The latter factor \n\nis in general agreement with the trends exhibited by (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-? and (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-\n\n? cathodes which were evaluated without and with the sublayer, correspondingly.

Such \n\na dependence might indicate that the electrochemical process is governed by a supply/removal of oxygen \n\nspecies from/into the electrolyte phase. \n\nThe presence of CGO20 sublayer or introduction of PrOx into the cathode layer reduces the \n\npolarization resistance down to ~7 Ohm\u00d7cm2 at 1073 K on La10Si5AlO26.5 electrolyte and transforms the \n\nappearance of the polarization curve from the Tafel-like to nearly linear dependencies (Figs. 4.17, 4.18). \n\nNevertheless, the trends related with the current direction discussed above remain essentially similar. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2. Physicochemical and electrode properties of (La1-xSrx)1-yMn0.5Ti0.5O3-? perovskites \n\n \n\nDue to attractive properties of titanates and manganites, the number of studies on (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-? \n\nsolid solutions as potential anode materials has been growing in last years.  Most works have been devoted to \n\noptimization of Mn:Ti ratio. Mn content was demonstrated to favorably influence the conductivity in \n\noxidizing atmospheres (at least up to 60%), while under anodic conditions the effect of Mn fraction in \n\nLa0.4Sr0.6Mn1-xTixO3-? is less obvious. On the other hand, increasing Mn content above 40 - 60% causes phase \n\ninstability in reducing atospheres [16]. In terms of the electrode microstructure, the presence of Mn is noted \n\nto ensure a better wettability of zirconia-based phases and provide higher electrode performance [352]. \n\nWhatever the effect of Mn:Ti ratio, the functional properties might also be modified by compositional \n\nvariations in A-sublattice. \n\nOn the other hand, the contribution of metallic phases basically present in the electrode layers into \n\nthe overall performance is not clear from the available data on the (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-?-based anodes. As the \n\ntechnology involving coating a metallic paste over the electrode cannot be utilized in industrial scale, it is \n\nnecessary to estimate the activity of the anode layers more relevant to practical applications. Moreover, the \n\npresence of an additional component obscures the properties of the main electrode phase and does not allow \n\nto reveal relationships between the functional characteristics and anode activity of the electrode material, \n\nwhich might be important for further compositional modifications. \n\nAs shown in Chapter 3.1, in (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? chromium may be partially or completely \n\nreplaced by Ti with simultaneous equivalent substitution in A-sublattice. However, introduction of Sr and Ti \n\nreduces the electronic conductivity down to the level insufficient for the electrochemical applications, \n\nespecially under anodic conditions while chemically-induced expansion achieves 0.6% for \n\n(La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-?. Although the latter composition did not exhibit a remarkable cathode or anode \n\nperformance, further variations of the cation ratios might provide an acceptable combination of the functional \n\nproperties. The present part is focused on evaluation of the effect of La:Sr cation ratio as well as A-site \n\nstoichiometry on the chemical and structural stability, thermomechanical properties, electronic and ionic \n\nconductivity and electrochemical performance of (La1-xSrx)1-yMn0.5Ti0.5O3-? (x = 0.15 - 0.75, y = 0 - 0.05) \n\nanodes in contact with LSGM electrolyte. The studies were partially carried out in the Institute of Solid State \n\n\n\n173 \n \n\nChemistry RAS, Chernogolovka, Russia, with participation of Dr. S.I. Bredikhin, Dr. V.V. Sinitsyn, Dr. I.N. \n\nBurmistrov, A.I. Ivanov, Yu.S. Fedotov, D.A. Agarkov. \n\n \n\n4.2.1.

The only exception relates to \n\n(La0.35Sr0.65)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? where one peak of Mn3O4, comparable to the background, might be suspected \n\nin the XRD pattern (Fig. 4.19). The crystal structure was refined as rhombohedrally-distorted perovskite \n\n(S.G.: c3R ). Similar symmetry has been earlier reported for other representatives of (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-? \n\nseries, namely, for La0.4Sr0.6Mn1-xTixO3-? (x = 0.4 - 0.8) [16], La0.8Sr0.2Mn0.9Ti0.1O3-?

In \n\ngeneral, the unit cell volume of cation-deficient perovskites tends to decrease with increasing x. Taking into \n\naccount that ionic radius of Sr2+ is larger in comparison with that of La3+ [133], the trend might primarily be \n\nassociated with increasing average oxidation state of Mn species and their resultant shrinkage on Sr-doping \n\n(suggesting that Ti is completely oxidized). One should note that increasing fraction of Mn4+ in Sr-enriched \n\nperovskites is consistent with trends observed in electronic conductivity in air, discussed below. \n\nThe creation of A-site cation vacancies leads to the unit cell volume expansion (Table 4.6), a result \n\nof stronger coulombic repulsion between the oxygen anions [613]. This factor also seems relevant for the La-\n\nrich compositions, where the crystal electroneutrality and lattice conservation conditions may lead to the \n\nformation of extra cation vacancies instead of Mn2+. \n\n \n\n \nTable 4.6.

The traces of MnO observed in the XRD pattern of (La0.35Sr0.65)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? might originate \n\nfrom Mn3O4 reduction. Reduction of La-enriched compositions (x = 0.15 - 0.25) leads to structural \n\ntransformation into the orthorhombic symmetry. Most likely, the transition is associated with extensive \n\noxygen losses from the perovskite structure and generation of large Mn2+ and/or Ti3+ cations, as follows from \n\nthe electroneutrality conditions. High quantities of these cations seem to lead to decreasing the tolerance \n\nfactor, favoring the stabilization of the orthorhombic lattice. In accordance with the cell parameters of \n\nreduced perovskites (Table 4.7), the lattice volume of reduced (La1-xSrx)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? (x = 0.45 - 0.65) \n\nexpands by 1 - 1.5 % with respect to the oxidized phases at room temperature due to lowering oxidation state \n\nof the B-site cations, increasing their average radii, and the oxygen vacancy formation promoting cation \n\nrepulsion. Enrichment of the compositions with La up to 75 - 85% increases the relative difference between \n\nthe cell volume of the reduced and oxidized phases up to 5 - 6 %, attributable to the structural \n\ntransformations. \n\n\n\n175 \n \n\n \n\n20 30 40 50 60 70 80\n\nx = 0.65\n\nx = 0.45 space group: R3c\n\nspace group: Pbnm\n\nMnO\n\nI,\n a\n\n.u\n.\n\n2?, \u00b0\n\n(La\n1-x\n\nSr\nx\n)\n\n0.95\nMn\n\n0.5\nTi\n\n0.5\nO\n\n3-?\n annealed at \n\np(O\n2\n) = 10\n\n-17\n atm, T = 1223 K, for 25 h\n\nx = 0.15\n\nspace group: R3c\n\n \n \n\nFig. 4.20.

Reviewing the literature data on the relationships between the densification \n\nof manganites and titanates and their composition, one might observe that increasing Sr content in La1-\n\nxSrxMnO3\u00b1? up to ~50% leads to smaller grain size. The effect is attributed to larger radius of Sr\n2+ in \n\ncomparison with La3+ hampering the A-site diffusion, as well as suppressed densification at high quantities of \n\nMn4+ [614, 615]. One should also take into account that the cation diffusion in manganites and resultant grain \n\ngrowth are promoted by higher A-site cation deficiency [614-616] which decreases upon introduction of Sr \n\ninto the perovskite [300, 303]. Similar effects might be expected for the (La1-xSrx)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3\u00b1? ceramics \n\nin the compositional range of 0.25<x<0.75. \n\nOn the other hand, the grain growth taking place on incorporation of donor-like cations into A- or B-\n\nsublattice of ATiO3-? perovskites (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) is maximum when the substitution is charge-compensated \n\nby other factors, such as a simultaneous generation of cation vacancies which enable to prevent a segregation \n\nof secondary phases or reduce the stresses in the lattice induced by generation of cations in the oxidation state \n\nunfavorable under given conditions (i.e. Ti3+) [247, 617, 618]. \n\n\n\n177 \n \n\nA \n\n \n\nB \n\n \n    \n\nC \n\n \n\nD \n\n \n\n \nFig. 4.22.

(D) sintered in air, polished and thermally \netched \n \n\nWith respect to the present system, the largest grains should be observed for the perovskites, where \n\nthe average oxidation state of Mn and Ti species is close to +3 and +4, respectively, while the oxygen content \n\napproaches the stoichiometric value. Such conditions should be satisfied for the composition with x ? 0.36, \n\nwhich explains the largest grain size of the nearest neighboring representatives in (La1-xSrx)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3\u00b1? \n\nseries, i.e. for x = 0.25 and 0.45. \n\nConsidering the possible reasons of the grain growth, one should also take into account a possible \n\nsegregation of secondary phases in the quantities within the uncertainties of XRD analysis. In particular, as \n\nshown by micrographs in Figs. 4.22 B and C, the perovskites with intermediate Sr content showed the \n\npresence of another phase at the grain boundaries; the same materials showed the maximum grain growth. \n\nEDS analysis showed an enrichment of the impurity particles with Mn atoms. The presence of this phase as \n\nwell as modest traces of glass-like phase might also contribute to better densification of the compositions \n\nwith x = 0.25 - 0.45. On the other hand, the Mn-enriched impurity might be segregated during the preparation \n\nof ceramics for the microscope analysis and not reflect the general sintering behaviour of the materials.  \n\n \n\n4.2.2. Thermal and chemical expansion \n\n \n\nSelected results of the controlled-atmosphere dilatometric measurements performed in the regimes \n\nof continuous heating and isothermal dwells with equilibration at 923 - 1223 K are presented in Figs. 4.23 \n\nand 4.24, respectively. As for other titanate- and manganite-based materials, the apparent TECs vary in the \n\n\n\n178 \n \n\nrange (9.8 - 15.0)\u00d710-6 K-1, slightly increasing on heating due to oxygen losses from the lattice (Fig. 4.23; \n\nTable 4.8). Introduction of Sr into (La1-xSrx)1-yMn0.5Ti0.5O3-?, charge-compensated by increasing oxidation \n\nstates of manganese cations, results in larger oxygen nonstoichiometry variations on heating or reduction. \n\nThese variations are reflected by higher values of the apparent TECs under similar conditions (Table 4.8) and \n\nby larger chemical expansion (Fig. 4.24; Table 4.9). The TECs are essentially unaffected by oxygen partial \n\npressure variations in oxidizing environments and tend to moderately increase in reducing atmospheres, again \n\ncorrelating with the chemically induced strains and conductivity variations discussed below.  \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 4.8.

The cation ratio in A-sublattice significantly \n\naffects the kinetics of achieving the steady-state properties upon variations of p(O2) or temperature; selected \n\nexamples are shown in Fig. 4.25. No equilibrium value of the relative elongation or total conductivity was \n\nattained for cation-deficient La-enriched perovskites (x = 0.15 - 0.25) during a reasonable time period. This \n\nsituation is opposite to the behaviour of the compositions with lower concentrations of La cations or cation-\n\nstoichiometric materials, as shown in Fig. 4.26. \n\nPossible origins of such a behavior might primarily relate to the phase transition upon extensive \n\noxygen losses shown by the materials with enhanced La content. As shown in numerous studies [619-621], \n\nstructural transformations are generally accompanied by a slow lattice recombination with prolonged time \n\nscale. Moreover, the presence of high amounts of La cations may induce generation of Mn3+/2+ and/or Ti4+/3+ \n\nredox couples causing a slower diffusion due to defect interactions. One should not also exclude the effects \n\nassociated with possible oxygen overstoichiometry. As discussed in Chapters 1.3, 1.5, La-enriched \n\nmanganites have a tendency towards formation of cation vacancies, while (Sr,La)TiO3\u00b1? may incorporate \n\nexcessive oxygen be generation of Sr-O planes between perovskite-like blocks. Both effects are promoted by \n\nhigher La content and oxidative conditions [300, 406, 407, 541] and lead to slow equilibration kinetics, \n\nwhich causes large scattering between experimental data [105, 300, 322, 407]. \n\n\n\n181 \n \n\n \n\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n\ntime, h\n\n0.65\n\n0.75\n\n0.85\n\n0.95\n\nlo\ng \n\n?\n, \n\nS\n<\n\ncm\n-1\n\n8.4\n\n8.8\n\n9.2\n\n9.6\n\n10.0\n\n?\nL\n\n/L\n0<\n\n10\n3\n\n1243 K\n0.21 atm\n\n1223 K\n0.21 atm\n\n1243 K\n9<10-5 atm\n\n1223 K\n9<10-5 atm\n\n1248 K\n0.21 atm\n\n(La\n0.75\n\nSr\n0.25\n\n)\n0.95\n\nMn\n0.5\n\nTi\n0.5\n\nO\n3-?\n\nFig. 4.25.

L0\u2019 is the initial \nlength at room temperature in air \n\n \n \n\nTo some extent, similar phenomena might be expected for (La,Sr)Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? with high La \n\namount. For example, assuming that no Mn2+ or Ti3+ species are formed in atmospheric air and suggesting \n\nthe phase purity of the compositions (as shown by XRD analysis), the perovskites \n\n(La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3\u00b1? and (La0.85Sr0.15)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3\u00b1? should accommodate at least 3.05 and 3.1 \n\noxygen atoms per perovskite formula unit. Even if the perovskite structure does not favour an excessive \n\noxygen content (for example, by generation of low-valent Mn or Ti species), the oxygen deficiency and \n\nresultant oxygen diffusivity are expected to be minimum for La-enriched materials which also yields a \n\nhindered equilibration of the corresponding perovskites. \n\n\n\n182 \n \n\nOne should note that preliminary maintenance of the ceramic material at elevated temperatures with \n\nsubsequent cooling basically accelerates the equilibration processes at lower temperatures, as shown in Fig. \n\n4.25. Although the kinetic factors may affect the general trends in the expansion behaviour as a function of \n\nthe perovskite composition, it should be separately stressed that the overall level of thermal- and chemical-\n\ninduced strains, observed in the wide range of temperature and oxygen partial pressure, is still moderate and \n\nthe title materials are thermomechanically compatible with various solid oxide electrolytes, such as stabilized \n\nzirconia, CGO, or LSGM [227, 580, 581, 587]. \n\n \n\n4.2.3. Electronic transport \n\n \n\nAs shown in Fig. 4.27, introduction of acceptor-type Sr2+ into (La1-xSrx)1-yMn0.5Ti0.5O3-? increases \n\nthe electronic conductivity, in accordance with the p-type charge transfer mechanism, typical for related \n\ncompositions. For the compositions with x = 0.15 - 0.65, the activation energies are quite similar, varying in \n\na narrow range 29 - 37 kJ/mol at 473 - 1283 K, whilst the Ea of (La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? is lower, 15 - 16 \n\nkJ/mol. (Table 4.10). The latter composition exhibits substantially higher values of the conductivity than the \n\nother materials. As discussed in Chapter 3.1.4, such difference in the transport behaviour may indicate a \n\ntendency to the transition from small-polaron hopping to broad-band conduction mechanism, caused by \n\nrising Mn4+ concentration and accompanied by lowering activation energy for the electronic charge carrier \n\nmobility. However, the absolute values of the Seebeck coefficient of (La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? (Figs. 4.28 \n\n- 4.30) cannot provide a supporting evidence for such hypothesis. \n\nRegardless of the microscopic mechanisms, the electrical properties of (La,Sr)Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? \n\nperovskites are essentially independent of the oxygen chemical potential in oxidizing and moderately \n\nreducing atmospheres (Fig. 4.28), thus indicating that the oxygen stoichiometry changes in these \n\nenvironments are very minor. Further reduction induces enhanced oxygen deficiency, which results in higher \n\nSeebeck coefficient and lower conductivity, as shown in Figs. 4.29 and 4.30. \n\n \n\n \nTable 4.10.

(C, D) \n \n\nThe trends in the transport-ralated parameters of (La1-xSrx)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? observable upon p(O2) \n\nand temperature variations are similar to those of (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? and doped chromites \n\nproviding another argument in favour of dominant p-type electronic transport. The variations of the \n\nconductivity and thermopower are accompanied with strong hystereses on redox cycling (Fig. 4.31), with an \n\napparently irreversible behavior for the La-rich materials. The irreversibility was attributed mainly to the \n\nmicrocrack formation detected on pos-tested samples visually and by optical microscopy inspections; \n\nhowever, kinetics of the orthorhombic - rhombohedral transition, defect reactions involving Mn3+/2+ and/or \n\nTi4+/Ti3+ redox couples or processes associated with participation of the cation vacancies or ordered structures \n\nmight also be relevant in the present case. The irreversible drop of the conductivity and mechanical \n\ninstability restrict the choice of anode material towards the compositions with a modest (<50%) La content. \n\nAnother peculiarity of the transport behavior of (La1-xSrx)1-yMn0.5Ti0.5O3-? is that increasing Sr \n\namount lowers the thermopower down to negative values. For the compositions with intermediate Sr content, \n\nwhen the average oxidation state of manganese cations is close to 3+, the Seebeck coefficient is expected to \n\nbe close to zero (Fig. 4.28). If the interaction between Mn3+/4+, Mn3+/2+, and Ti4+/3+ states is strong enough and \n\none type of the electronic charge carriers prevails, the latter situation may take place when the charge carrier \n\nconcentration corresponds to approximately half of the density of states. In such case, increasing the fraction \n\nof Mn4+ compensating large Sr2+ additions leads to the hole concentration above 50% sites available for their \n\nlocation, shifting the Seebeck coefficient down to negative values; increasing La3+ concentration has the \n\nopposite effect. \n\n\n\n185 \n \n\n  \n\n-20 -16 -12 -8 -4 0\n\nlog p(O2) (atm)\n\n0.0\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n1.2\n\nlo\ng \n\n?\n (\n\nS\n<\n\ncm\n-1\n\n)\n\n-40\n\n-20\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n?\n, \n\u00b5\n\nV\n<\n\nK\n-1\n\n(La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-?\n(La0.85Sr0.15)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-?\n\nT = 1223 K\n\n \n\n \nFig. 4.31.

For the related \n\ncompositions with similar La3+ and Sr2+ concentrations, an analogous behavior may appear if the deviations \n\nfrom ideal [La]/[Sr]=1 ratio are charge compensated by ionic point defects, namely, cation or oxygen \n\nvacancies, as for (La,Sr)MnO3\u00b1? with modest strontium content [300, 303]. Such assumptions may explain \n\nthe fact that the nearly zero thermopower values are observed for the compositions with intermediate Sr2+ \n\nconcentrations, particularly for (La0.55Sr0.45)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3\u00b1? and (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3\u00b1? (Fig. 4.28), \n\nwith presumably negligible concentration of vacancies (<0.05 - 0.06 per perovskite formula lattice). In the \n\ncase of charge compensation via the cation vacancy formation, this level of nonstoichiometry may still be \n\ntolerated by the perovskite lattice. Although the electronic conduction of these materials slightly increases \n\nwith Sr content, the overall level of the conductivity is similar for both compositions (Figs. 4.27, 4.28), in \n\ncontrast to (La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? and (La0.85Sr0.15)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3\u00b1?. \n\nFinally, one should mention that the experimentally observed trends cannot completely exclude \n\nmore complex mechanisms when several types of the electronic charge carriers may be present and low \n\nabsolute values of the Seebeck coefficient correspond to comparable contributions of the p- and n-type \n\ncharge carriers, i.e. tp?p ? tn?n where t is the transference number. However, no indication of significant n-\n\ntype contribution can be identified from the conductivity dependencies on oxygen partial pressure and cation \n\ncomposition. \n\n\n\n186 \n \n\n4.2.4. Oxygen permeability and isotope diffusion studies \n\n \n\nMeasurements of the oxygen permeability through dense membranes (La1-xSrx)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? \n\ndemonstrated a dominant limiting effect of the oxygen surface exchange kinetics; any estimation of the bulk \n\nionic conductivity was impossible. A similar behavior has earlier been observed for dense (La1-xSrx)1-yMnO3-? \n\nceramics with x = 0.4 - 0.6 [622]. For example, Fig. 4.32 displays the data on oxygen permeation fluxes \n\nthrough (La0.35Sr0.65)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? membranes with different thicknesses as a function of the oxygen \n\npartial pressure gradient expressed via the (p2/p1) ratio, where p1 and p2 are the oxygen pressures at the \n\nmembrane permeate and feed sides, respectively. The oxygen fluxes are essentially equal for the 0.60- and \n\n1.00-mm thick ceramics within the limits of experimental error. This tendency unambiguously indicates that \n\noxygen transport is governed by the surface exchange rate, on the contrary to (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-\n\nxTixO3-? system where the contributions of interfacial exchange and bulk ionic conduction are significant. \n\nWhile the behavior of the Cr-containing perovskites made it possible to detect a significant impact \n\nof the grain boundary diffusion, no similar conclusions can be drawn for the title system, although the grain \n\nboundary mechanism of ionic transport should not be a priori neglected. In particular, the steady-state \n\npermeation fluxes through dense (La1-xSrx)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? membranes are, in fact, quite similar to one \n\nanother due to very low oxygen nonstoichiometry (Fig. 4.33). In these conditions, the role of grain boundary \n\ndiffusion is expected to increase as for lanthanum manganite [336, 339]. The low oxygen vacancy \n\nconcentration is also responsible for relatively large scattering in the experimental data. Nevertheless, the \n\noxygen permeability of (La1-xSrx)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? tends to increase with increasing Sr amount, in correlation \n\nwith the oxygen nonstoichiometry variations revealed by the chemical expansion measurements. \n\nThe permeation fluxes through (La1-xSrx)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? ceramics are lower compared to SrMnO3-\n\nbased phases, such as Sr0.7Ce0.3MnO3-? [320, 605], where the oxygen deficiency is substantially higher (Fig. \n\n4.34).

In \n\nagreement with the oxygen permeation data, the tracer diffusion coefficients in La0.6Sr0.4Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? and \n\nLa0.5Sr0.5Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? are very similar to one another, whereas the surface exchange coefficients tend to \n\n\n\n188 \n \n\nincrease with acceptor content. The values of D* are lower even with respect to lanthanum-strontium \n\nmanganites, suggesting that the oxygen anions located near Ti4+ are essentially excluded from the migration \n\nprocesses. This assumption is consistent with slower ionic transport in titanates or titanate-doped perovskites, \n\nas discussed in Chapter 1.5. If compared to oxygen-deficient Sr0.75Y0.25Mn0.5Co0.5O3-? [624] and oxygen-\n\nhyperstoichiometric Pr2CuO4+? [625], the difference in the oxygen diffusivity at atmospheric p(O2) is up to \n\nfive to eight orders of magnitude. Regardless of the relevant microscopic mechanisms, this level of oxygen \n\nionic transport is insufficient to expect any substantial enhancement of the catalytically-active reaction zone \n\ndue to a contribution of the electrode bulk diffusion into the electrochemical processes. \n\n \n\n \n\n-17\n\n-15\n\n-13\n\n-11\n\n-9\n\n-7\n\n8.0 8.5 9.0 9.5 10.0 10.5\n-13\n\n-11\n\n-9\n\n-7\n\n-5\n\n-3\n\n10\n4\n/T, K\n\n-1\n\nlo\ng \n\nk\n (\n\ncm\n\u00d7\ns-\n\n1 )\nlo\n\ng \nD\n\n* \n(c\n\nm\n2 \u00d7\n\ns-\n1 )\n\nB\n\nLa\n0.5\n\nSr\n0.5\n\nMn\n0.5\n\nTi\n0.5\n\nO\n3-?\n\nLa\n0.6\n\nSr\n0.4\n\nMn\n0.5\n\nTi\n0.5\n\nO\n3-?\n\nLa\n0.75\n\nSr\n0.25\n\nMnO\n3\u00b1?\n\nLa\n0.8\n\nSr\n0.2\n\nMnO\n3\u00b1?\n\nSr\n0.75\n\nY\n0.25\n\nMn\n0.5\n\nCo\n0.5\n\nO\n3-?\n\nPr\n2\nCuO\n\n4+?\n\nA\n\n \n\nFig. 4.35.

[624, 625] studied under identical conditions \n \n\n \n\n4.2.5. Electrode behaviour \n\n \nSummarizing the behaviour of perovskite-type (La1-xSrx)1-yMn0.5Ti0.5O3-?, one should stress that the \n\nchemical and thermal expansion increases with increasing Sr content (Figs. 4.23, 4.24; Tables 4.8, 4.9). The \n\nsame trend was observed for electronic conduction in oxidizing atmospheres, whereas under reducing \n\n\n\n189 \n \n\nconditions the total conductivity values are essentially similar in the entire compositional range studied in \n\nthis work (Figs. 4.29, 4.30). The La-rich materials such as (La0.85Sr0.15)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? exhibit smaller \n\noxygen nonstoichiometry variations on reduction and, thus, a more pronounced tendency to p(O2)-\n\nindependent  concentration of the electronic charge carriers and conductivity at temperatures below 1100 K \n\n(Fig. 4.30C); however, their reduction is accompanied with strong and apparently irreversible hysteresis \n\nphenomena (Fig. 4.31). Although the ionic transport parameters, including the oxygen permeability and \n\nsurface exchange rate, tend to increase with x (Figs. 4.33, 4.34), the overall level of the ionic conduction is \n\nlow and no significant influence on the electrode performance may be expected due to minor variations in the \n\nthese parameters. With respect to the compositional trends in the functional characteristics, the compositions \n\nwith intermediate strontium concentrations (x = 0.4 - 0.6) seem to provide an optimum combination of the \n\nelectronic transport and thermomechanical properties. \n\nAs will be demonstrated in Chapter 5.3.2, anodes based on cation-deficient \n\n(La0.85Sr0.15)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? exhibit a strong tendency towards densification and require specific preparation \n\nprocedure in order to achieve an adequate porosity and provide a good adhesion to the electrolyte. Moreover, \n\nthe values of the overpotential are still high for the title anode, presumably due to the microstructural factors. \n\nTherefore, the electrochemical studies were carried out on La0.5Sr0.5Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? anode which may \n\nbe considered as a compromise composition which reasonably satisfies the requirements in terms of the \n\nstability, transport and thermomechanical properties. The electrode layers La0.5Sr0.5Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? exhibit \n\nhomogeneous porous microstructures where submicron grain size is preserved (Fig. 4.36). No essential \n\nmicrostructural changes were observed after electrochemical testing. \n\nFigs. 4.37 and 4.38 illustrate the behaviour of porous La0.5Sr0.5Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? electrode layers applied \n\nonto LSGM at 873 - 1073 K in H2-containing atmosphere. Analogously to the (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-\n\nxTixO3-? electrodes, the rate-determining steps should be related to the electrode surface; the key factors \n\nlimiting anodic performance are expected to include the interfacial exchange kinetics and electronic \n\nconduction. One argument in favour of the non-negligible role of the electronic transport is that the activation \n\nenergy for electrode conductivity (Fig. 4.38) is significatly lower than Ea values for oxygen permeability, \n\ndiffusion, and surface exchange (Table 4.11). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 4.36.

Temperature dependence of the polarization \nresistance of porous La0.5Sr0.5Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? anode applied \nonto LSGM electrolyte with CGO20 sublayer under OCV \nconditions \n\n \n\n \n\nWhatever the electrode reaction mechanism, the electrochemical activity of La0.5Sr0.5Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? \n\nanode layers appears significantly better than that of (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? [10] and is close to that of \n\nMn-free (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Fe0.4Cr0.6O3-? anodes with similar microstructures. Considering the negative effects \n\nassociated with the presence of chromium in SOFCs, namely, volatilization of chromium oxides and \n\nformation of Cr6+-containing phases in oxidizing conditions at low temperatures, La0.5Sr0.5Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? and \n\nits analogues provide significant advantages with respect to the LaCrO3-based electrode materials. The \n\nanodic overpotentials of La0.5Sr0.5Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? are, however, still high in comparison with the Ni-containing \n\ncermets, thus making it necessary to incorporate the metallic and, possibly, catalytically active components in \n\n(La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-? based anodes. \n\n \n \n\n4.3. Concluding remarks \n\n \n\nStudies on (La1-xSrx)1-yMn0.5Ti0.5O3-? and SrMn1-xNbxO3-? perovskites showed that the stabilization \n\nof the single phase manganites at low p(O2) is an achievable task, although requires comparatively high (up \n\nto 50%) amount of high-valent dopant to avoid phase decomposition. One of important features of doped \n\nmanganites relates to possible structural transformations on thermal or redox cycling, accompanied by slow \n\nequilibration kinetics, mechanical failure due to large volume changes, hysteresis phenomena on redox \n\ncycling, in some cases resulting in irreversible degradation of the functional characteristics, etc. Such a \n\nbehaviour was especially pronounced for donor-rich (La1-xSrx)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? and CaMn0.5Nb0.5O3-?. On the \n\nother hand, these effects may be avoided or suppressed by appropriate selection of the composition; in \n\n\n\n191 \n \n\nparticular, a relatively rapid equilibration was observed for La0.5Sr0.5Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? and SrMn1-xNbxO3-? \n\nceramic samples. \n\nThe expansivity of SrMn1-xNbxO3-? (x = 0.4 - 0.5) and (La1-xSrx)1-yMn0.5Ti0.5O3-? is moderate and is \n\nstrongly influenced by chemical contribution arising due to oxygen nonstoichiometry variations. The \n\nchemical expansion of (La1-xSrx)1-yMn0.5Ti0.5O3-? under reducing conditions is below 0.6% and diminishes on \n\nappropriate La-doping into the perovskite. \n\nDonor doping into the title perovskites reduces the concentration of p-type electronic charge \n\ncarriers. Moreover, for SrMn1-xNbxO3-? introduction of Nb into B-sublattice negatively influences the \n\nmobility of the charge carriers; both factors result in suppressed electronic conductivity upon La or Nb-\n\ndoping. At the same time, under anode environments, the compositional effect on the electronic transport is \n\nless critical which enables to optimize other functional characteristics without substantial degradation of the \n\nelectronic transport. Taking into account the low values of the conductivity at high p(O2), La-enriched (La1-\n\nxSrx)1-yMn0.5Ti0.5O3-? and SrMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? are inappropriate for cathode applications. Considering the \n\nbehaviour of CaMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? perovskite, this material can hardly be considered as a component of SOFC \n\nanodes or cathodes, due to insufficient stability even under moderately reducing atmospheres, low electronic \n\nconductivity, large variations of the TEC upon thermal cycling and a strong tendency towards the hysteresis \n\nbehavior and slow equilibration. \n\nThe ionic transport parameters for heavily-doped manganites are rather low to ensure any \n\nsubstantial enlargement of the electrochemically-active zone and seem to correlate with Mn content in the \n\nperovskite. This effect may relate to facilitated Mn reducibility, in particular to a higher flexibility of Mn \n\ncations towards changes in the oxygen coordination which enables higher oxygen deficiency in the \n\nperovskite structure or promotion of the surface processes by Mn species. Another origin might relate to a \n\nnegative influence of Ti or Nb species on the oxygen ionic diffusion, in particular by stabilization of oxygen \n\natoms in the vicinity of the donor cation excluding O2- from the transport mechanism. \n\nDue to an acceptable combination of the phase and structural stability, transport and \n\nthermomechanical properties as well as microstructural behaviour, the anodes composed of \n\nLa0.5Sr0.5Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? yield the polarization resistance as low as 1.5 - 2.0 Ohm\u00d7cm\n2 at 1073 K without a \n\nspecific anode modification. The level of the electrochemical activity is comparable with that of \n\n(La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? and (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? (x = 0.3 - 0.4), while the title composition \n\nmay be advantageous over the chromites in terms of the absence of chromium cations having the tendency \n\ntowards generation of Cr6+ species or formation of volatile compounds with subsequent degradation of the \n\nelectrode characteristics upon thermal/redox cycling. However, further studies, primarily in terms of the \n\nperformance stability, are required for all the electrodes studied in order to evaluate the applicability of the \n\nmaterials in SOFC technology. \n\n\n\n192 \n \n\nChapter 5. Major trends and factors relevant for the SOFC anode performance \n\n \n\nIn Chapters 3 - 4, selected chromite, manganite and titanate-based groups of anode materials were \n\ncharacterized in terms of their functional properties and general compositional trends observed in the \n\nelectrode performance. The present part is devoted to comparative studies of the electrochemical properties \n\nof the perovskite-like and selected cermet anodes, elucidation of the basic factors affecting the electrode \n\nbehaviour and search of possible routes to optimize the anode activity. \n\nFor fabrication of the electrochemical cells operated in the intermediate temperature range (873 - \n\n1073 K), two types of solid electrolyte materials were selected, namely, (La0.9Sr0.1)0.98Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-? (LSGM) \n\nand La10Si5AlO26.5. The choice of ionic conductors and the particular cation compositions was based on the \n\ncombination of optimum functional characteristics, primarily in terms of the transport properties, stability \n\nunder the operation conditions and availability of the precursor materials. \n\nConsidering other widely used families of solid electrolytes, zirconia-based solid solutions possess a \n\nnegligible level of the electronic conductivity, beneficial for the electrolyte application. However, the level of \n\nthe ionic conductivity in these oxides is 1 - 2 orders lower in comparison with other candidates, such as \n\nLSGM, La9.33Si6O26- or CeO2-based oxides, which makes YSZ more appropriate for applications at higher \n\ntemperatures rather than in IT-SOFCs. Moreover, some concerns are related with the chemical compatibility \n\nof doped ZrO2 with compositions enriched with rare-earth or alkali-earth cations [30, 329, 626, 627]. Doped \n\nceria suffer from excitation of non-negligible electronic transport and large expansion under reducing \n\nconditions, especially promoted by dissolution of transition metal cations penetrated from the electrode phase \n\n[5, 30, 237]. This problem imposes severe requirements on the temperature range of applications of CeO2-\n\nbased compositions. On the other hand, CeO2-? and its derivatives may be successfully utilized as \n\ncomponents of the electrode materials or as protective layers between the electrolyte and electrodes. \n\nLanthanum gallate-based materials seem to be more appropriate for electrolyte applications in the \n\nintermediate temperature range in terms of the transport and thermomechanical properties. As discussed \n\nbelow, apatite-type silicates show a worse combination of the functional characteristics, especially in terms \n\nof poor stability. However, the availability and low price of the precursor materials as well as large doping \n\npossibilities which may to some extent enable to overcome or reduce the concerns indicated also make these \n\nmaterials attractive for further studies. This chapter is devoted to comparative overview of the stability and \n\ntransport characteristics of LaGaO3- and La9.33Si6O26-based materials and evaluation of the electrode \n\nperformance of perovskite-like and cermet anodes in contact with the corresponding electrolytes. \n\n \n5.1. Applicability of lanthanum silicate- and lanthanum gallate-based materials as solid \n\nelectrolytes: a brief overview. \n \n5.1.1. Stability, transport and thermomechanical properites \n\n \n\nAs discussed in previous sectons, the electrochemical behavior is strongly influenced by the \n\ntransport properties and stability of the electrolyte as well as by its compatibility with the electrode material, \n\nsublayer or other SOFC components. Therefore, analysis of the electrode properties should involve \n\n\n\n193 \n \n\nconsideration of the available data on the oxygen ionic conductivity and long-term behavior of gallate- and \n\nsilicate-based solid electrolytes. \n\nTemperature dependencies of the total conductivity of selected LaGaO3-based materials in air or \n\nmoderately reducing atmospheres are presented in Fig. 5.1. Typical for perovskite-type compositions, oxygen \n\nvacancies are the dominant ionic charge carriers and the transport properties may be modified by an \n\nappropriate acceptor-type doping. The largest conductivity was found for compositions containing La3+ and \n\nSr2+ cations in A-sublattice, due to minimum lattice strains favorable to the oxygen diffusion [628 - 630]. \n\nAmong B-site dopants, the maximum ionic transfer was achieved by introduction of an appropriate quantity \n\nof 2-fold charged cations (Mg, Co, Fe), due to ensuring a substantial amount and fast mobility of oxygen \n\nvacancies [629, 631, 632]. In (La,Sr)(Ga,Mg)O3-? series, the largest values of the ionic conductivity were \n\nobtained for 10 - 20% of Sr and 15 - 20% of Mg which amounted to 0.10 - 0.17 S/cm at 1073 K with the \n\nactivation energy of 90 - 110 kJ/mol [581, 629, 631-634]. For comparison, the conductivity of (Zr,Y)O2-? \n\noxides varies in the range (5 - 8)\u00d710-2 S/cm at 1073 K [30, 626]. Further addition of the acceptor-type cations \n\ninto LSGM induces vacancy ordering [635, 636]. The perovskite structure of gallates allows a slight (up to \n\n~2%) A-site cation deficiency; exceeding the limit substantially deteriorates the transport properties [581, \n\n637]. The content of the transition metal cations in B-sublattice should be restricted by 3 - 7% in order to \n\navoid the drop of the ionic conductivity, contribution of the electronic transport or thermomechanical \n\nproblems ([30] and references cited). \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 5.1. Temperature dependencies of the total \nconductivity of selected LaGaO3-based \ncompositions. The data in [628, 629, 631] were \nobtained at p(O2)?10\n\n-5 atm, other results \ncorrespond to the atmospheric oxygen pressure \n\n \nAnalogously with numerous ionic conductors and semiconductors, the functional properties of \n\nLSGM are affected by sintering procedure, in particular by the ceramics microstructure and formation of \n\n\n\n194 \n \n\nsecondary phases (La2O3, LaSrGaO4, Sr3Ga2O6 etc.) at the grain boundaries or on the surface. As shown in \n\n[581], the presence of the secondary phases as well as an enrichment of the grain boundaries with Sr and Mg \n\nmay have a hampering effect on the oxygen ionic conductivity and promote the electronic contribution. \n\nNevertheless, the electronic transference numbers in LSGM and related materials do not exceed 0.02, as \n\nshown in Table 5.1, which may be considered to be acceptable for utilization this group of materials as solid \n\nelectrolytes. Increasing the sintering time ensures nearly complete dissolution of the impurities in the \n\nperovskite structure; another approach to bind the secondary phases and diminish their negative effects \n\nrelates to introduction of scavenging agents [478]. \n\n \n\nTable 5.1.

An alternative mechanism taking place in oxygen-deficient representatives and \n\ninvolving the transport of oxygen vacancies proceeds much slower [585, 639]. Therefore, the transport \n\nproperties are promoted by doping strategies leading to formation of overstoichiometric oxygen in \n\ncomparison with the parent silicate, i.e. by introducing the cations stable in high oxidation state. On the other \n\nhand, excessive La or Si content complicates formation of single-phase materials and ceramics densification, \n\n\n\n195 \n \n\ndeteriorates the stability, especially in reducing and/or wet atmospheres, induces volatilization of silica \n\nspecies, etc. As a result, the optimum ionic conductivity was found for apatites slightly substituted in B-\n\nsublattice and/or possessing a moderate La excess in comparison with the parent composition (Fig. 5.2) [580, \n\n641, 642]. Selected studies have been carried out on germanate-based analogues, but their applicability is \n\nlimited by high costs and volatilization of GeO2, tendency towards formation of glassy phase and a phase \n\ntransition at 1000 - 1100 K shown by lanthanum germanate on heating in air [641, 642]. \n\nPromotion of the ionic transport in La9.33Si6O26 was observed by introducing Al, Fe, Mg cations into \n\nthe apatite lattice, accompanied by a decrease of the corresponding activation energy attributable to \n\nformation of a new conduction path due to reduced bonding energy of the metal with oxygen [23, 640, 641]. \n\nAn increase of the ionic transport was also observed for Nb-doped silicates, due to increasing the amount of \n\nthe charge carriers with simultaneous preservation of the single phase composition [24]. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 5.2. Temperature dependencies of the total \nconductivity of selected apatite-type silicate and \ngermanate compositions in air \n\n \n \nThe electronic contribution into the overall conductivity of the apatites basically correlates with \n\ngeneration of excessive oxygen atoms and increases with Al or Fe introduction. This phenomenon is \n\nattributed to localization of the electronic defects in the vicinity of the lattice defects with the opposite \n\ncharge, i.e. oxygen interstitials [580]. The electronic transference numbers in apatites are within 0.01, as \n\nshown in Table 5.1. \n\nOne of most significant concerns related to both electrolyte materials is associated with insufficient \n\nstability towards operation atmospheres and compatibility with other cell components. For LSGM, the main \n\nproblem is associated with volatilization of gallium oxides and oxyhydroxides, especially pronounced under \n\nreducing or wet atmospheres. For cation stoichiometric perovskites, Ga losses may lead to generation of \n\nLa2O3, LaSrGaO4 and other phases enriched with A-cations. Subsequent exposure of La2O3 to H2O or CO2-\n\n\n\n196 \n \n\ncontaining atmosphere induces formation of hydroxides or carbonates, with resultant deterioration of the \n\ntransport properties and degradation of the mechanical integrity. Any contact of LSGM with Pt promotes the \n\ndepletion of the electrolyte with Ga, due to formation of intermetallic Ga-Pt compounds [633, 637, 581]. \n\nIn order to avoid separation of the La- or Sr-enriched impurities, a particular interest has been drawn \n\nby A-site cation deficient gallates, although an excess of Ga in the perovskite lattice may accelerate the \n\nvaporization-related processes. The phenomena indicated impose requirements on the electrolyte processing \n\nconditions. On the other hand, LSGM-based materials do not suffer from essential ageing phenomena in the \n\nintermediate temperature range, in contrast to zirconia electrolytes [647]. \n\nThe literature reports on the stability of the apatite-based compounds are contradictory. In particular, \n\na stable conductivity was detected in wet Ar [640], 20% H2 [648], wet H2 and wet CO2 [649]. However, these \n\nresults relate to comparatively low temperatures, up to 1073 K, while the testing time was limited by 50 - 70 \n\nhours. In contrast, long maintaining (1000 hours) of La9.77Si6O26.655 and La10Si6O27 at 1073 K in air resulted \n\nin ~5% drop of the conductivity [650], while increasing the operation temperature up to 1173 K revealed \n\n~20% degradation of the total conductivity after 350 hours of reduction of La10Si5AlO26.5 at p(O2) ? 10\n-18 atm \n\n[21]. Possible origins of the degradation observed seem to be associated with segregation or volatilization of \n\nSiO2 which is accompanied by formation of La2O3-based compositions. The separation of the secondary \n\nphases deteriorates the transport properties and affects the mechanical integrity of the ceramics. While in the \n\ntemperature range corresponding to the working conditions of the electrochemical cell the stability seems to \n\nbe sufficient, any necessity to elevate the ambient temperature (i.e. during the process of the cell preparation \n\nor sealing) is detrimental for the functional characteristics of the electrolyte material. Taking into account the \n\nreactivity and strong cation interdiffusion between the apatite phase and numerous electrode materials, as \n\ndiscussed below, the issue of the chemical stability is the most critical limitation for the high-temperature \n\napplication of lanthanum silicate-based materials. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.1.2. Performance of electrochemical cells composed of gallate- and silicate-based \n\nelectrolytes \n \n\nReviewing the data on the electrochemical performance gallate-based electrochemical cells, one \n\nshould mention that the basic limitations are associated with the electrode materials rather than with the \n\ngallate phase or relate to the problems of the chemical compatibility between the components. As a \n\nconfirmation of the good applicability of LSGM for the electrochemical utilizations, the polarization \n\nresistance of the cathodes and anodes in contact with this electrolyte series may be reduced below 0.1 - 0.5 \n\nOhm\u00d7cm2; examples will be presented in following sections. Promising performances have been obtained for \n\nmanganite- [651], ferrite- [652], nickelate- [593, 594] and especially cobaltite-based [9, 278, 653] cathodes. \n\nAmong anodes, acceptable characteristics have been obtained for both conventional cermets [567, 654, 655] \n\nand for alternative materials [15, 18, 264, 547, 556]. A reasonable activity towards electrochemical oxidation \n\nof hydrocarbon- [116, 230], ethanol- [408], H2S-containing [116] fuels was observed for cells with LSGM \n\nelectrolyte. Acceptable performance was obtained utilizing composite electrodes with gallate-based materials \n\n\n\n197 \n \n\nas ionic-conductive components [651, 654], although in this case the issue of the phase interaction becomes \n\ncritical. One should note that most promising results were collected on the cells containing protective layers \n\nbetween LSGM and electrodes in order to avoid the interaction between the components. \n\nDue to comparatively short period of studies of the apatite-based electrochemical cells and because \n\nof their poor performance, the amount of available data on the polarization characteristics of electrodes in \n\ncontact with lanthanum silicates is extremely few. Among the data reported one may note the results obtained \n\nfor Ni - CGO, Sr2MgMoO6-?, La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? anodes as well as for La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-? and \n\nLa0.7Sr0.3FeO3-? cathodes on La10Si5.5Al0.5O26.75 showing the area-specific resistance (ASR) in the range of 0.5 \n\n- 1.0 Ohm\u00d7cm2 at 1073 K, while for La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-?, the corresponding value was obtained as low as \n\n0.04 Ohm\u00d7cm2 [566]. Acceptable performance of the electrodes listed basically necessitates the presence of \n\nthe buffer layer. One should emphasize that all the electrodes studied were covered with Pt ink. A \n\ncomparable level of the electrode activity was obtained for platinum or (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-?-based cathodes \n\ndeposited onto La9.8Ge5.5Al0.5O26.45 [656]. \n\nLa0.6Sr0.4CoO3-? and La0.6Sr0.4Co1-xFexO3-? cathodes in contact with La10Si5.8Al0.2O26.9 showed the R? \n\nin the range of 0.3 - 1.8 Ohm\u00d7cm2 without any specific optimization, while subsequent introduction of Ag \n\nparticles by wet impregnation reduced the polarization resistance down to 0.08 Ohm\u00d7cm2 [657]. A cell with \n\nLa0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-? cathode, La9.62Si5.79Al0.21O26.33 electrolyte and Ni - CGO anode showed the power \n\ndensity of 250 mW/cm2 at 1073 K [658] which seems to be rather promising taking into account the \n\ncomparatively thick (720 \u00b5 m) electrolyte thickness. \n\nOn the other hand, conventional anode and cathode materials without any specific modification \n\n(which may be too expensive and unreasonable for practical applications) showed extremely large \n\npolarization resistances, exceeding 100 - 1000 Ohm\u00d7cm2 [659-661]. Moreover, many electrochemical cells \n\nshowed a fast and irreversible degradation of the electrode performance which is not surprising taking into \n\naccount the drop of the total conductivity shown by lanthanum silicates at elevated temperature and strong \n\nsusceptibility of most electrochemically-active materials towards contamination with silica. Poor electrode \n\ncharacteristics have been found for metal-apatite cermet composites [661], although fabrication of similar \n\ncomposites with other ionic conductors has been found to be beneficial. This, in particular, demonstrates the \n\nabsence or negligible contribution of any catalytic effect from the silicate-based phases into the \n\nelectrochemical process. \n\nAs shown from the examples, the information on the performance of apatite-containing \n\nelectrochemical cells is contradictive. Taking into account a poor availability of the experimental results on \n\nthe anode activity collected from silicate-based cells, more studies on the electrode activity of layers coated \n\nonto the apatite-based electrolytes are required in order to clarify their potential for electrochemical \n\napplications. The following parts are focused on studying the basic factors responsible for the electrode \n\nperformance of perovskite-type and cermet anode materials deposited onto apatite-type La10Si5AlO26.5. A \n\nparticular attention is drawn to the interaction/interdiffusion phenomena and performance degradation. As no \n\nspecial steps were undertaken to modify the electrochemical properties, the polarization values are expected \n\nto be rather high, and the work has primarily an investigating nature. \n\n\n\n198 \n \n\n5.2. Electrochemical activity of cermet anodes deposited onto lanthanum silicate-based \n\nsolid electrolyte \n \n\nComposite powders consisting of electronic and ionic conducting components (basically, metallic \n\nand solid electrolyte phases) are the most studied and widely used materials for SOFC anodes, although the \n\ncorresponding electrode layers may have some disadvantages in comparison with MIEC anodes, primarily in \n\nterms of stringent requirements to their microstructure [1, 2, 7, 662, 663]. Ni is one of the most common \n\ncomponents in cermets, although its content should be moderate in order to avoid the problems associated \n\nwith the sintering of the metallic particles, formation of volatile compounds, large volume changes on redox \n\ncycling or anode contamination in C- or S-containing fuels ([1, 7, 266] and references cited). \n\nThe present part is devoted to studies of selected cermet anodes in contact with La10Si5AlO26.5 \n\nelectrolyte. One of particular tasks relates to partial or complete replacement of Ni with other metals without \n\na loss of the electrochemical performance. The technique of preparation of the electrode layers is described in \n\nTable 2.5. \n\nSEM analysis carried out on as-prepared half-cells or those after the electrochemical tests revealed \n\nan acceptable porosity of the electrode layers and satisfactory connectivity between the cermet electrodes and \n\nelectrolyte (Fig. 5.3). The thickness of the electrode layers varied in the range 15 - 40 \u00b5 m. Particles of \n\nCGO20 phase showed a tendency towards formation of large agglomerates (up to 10 - 20 \u00b5 m); nevertheless, \n\nthe porosity was preserved, although the TPB length might be substantially affected by the poor dispersion. \n\nThe presence of silver in the anode composition yielded generation of 5 - 10 \u00b5 m sphere-like domains as \n\nshown in Fig. 5.3 C. \n\n \n \n\n \n\nA B C \n\nFig. 5.3.

The electrochemical performance of the anodes is poor; the \n\ncorresponding polarization resistances vary in the range 2 - 20 Ohm\u00d7cm2, which is 1 - 2 orders of magnitude \n\nlarger than required for an adequate operation of a SOFC. \n\n\n\n199 \n \n\nTable 5.2.

Diffusion of La into the cermet, which might be promoted by the apatite phase \n\ndecomposition, is clearly observable in Fig. 5.6, although the elemental distribution over the anode layer is \n\nnon-obvious, due to small amount of the contaminant and poor resolution of the technique. Penetration of \n\nrare-earth cations from the respective silicates or gallates into the electrodes has been observed in former \n\nstudies [566, 591]. In the present case, La species might primarily dissolve in fluorite with deterioration of \n\nthe transport properties and electrochemical activity in comparison with (Ce,Gd)O2-? phases [88, 664, 665]. \n\n\n\n200 \n \n\n2 6 10 14 18 22\n\ni, mA/cm2\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n?\n, m\n\nV\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\nCu-8YSZ (40-60 vol.%)\nCu-CGO20 (40-60 vol.%)\nAg-CGO20 (40-60 vol.%)\nNi-CGO20 (20-80 vol.%)\n\n1073 K\n\n973 K\n\nelectolyte:\nLa10Si5AlO26.5\n\nA\n\nB\n\n \n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n?\n, m\n\nV\n\n5 15 25 35 45\n\ni, mA/cm2\n\nAg-Ni-CGO20\n(16-16-67 vol.%)\n\nas-prepared\n\nAg-Ni-CGO20\n(10-10-80 vol.%)\n\nas-prepared\n\nCeO\n2\n-modified\n\nAg-Ni-CGO20\n(5-5-90 vol.%)\n\nas-prepared\n\nNi-CGO20\n(20-80 vol.%)\n\nas-prepared\n\nNi-8YSZ-CGO20\n(50-30-20 vol.%)\n\nLa\n2\nO\n\n3\n-, Ni-modified\n\nCGO20\nNi-modified\n\n1073 K\n10% H\n\n2\n - H\n\n2\nO - N\n\n2\n\nelectrolyte\n\nLa\n10\n\nSi\n5\nAlO\n\n26.5\n\n \n\nFig. 5.4.

The resultant deficiency in Si and Al in the apatite \n\npromotes the separation of La2O3, with subsequent degradation of the electrolyte transport properties, \n\nelectrochemical activity of the anode, adhesion between the layers, etc. \n\n \n\n \n \nFig. 5.6.

Despite the apparently low concentration, the presence of silica is \n\ndetrimental for the electrochemical properties, as indicated in [566, 591, 594]. One should note that the EDS \n\nanalysis was carried out on half-cells subjected to a single annealing at 1200 - 1300 K in air and one might \n\nexpect more substantial diffusion or interaction between the cell components even after a short (5 - 10 hours) \n\nmeasurement procedure. Another notion is that the results of EDS analysis do not demonstrate the actual \n\namount of the elements and may be considered only for comparative studies provided that the collection of \n\nthe data was carried out under similar scanning conditions. In particular, the technique used has a various \n\nsensitivity towards light and heavy elements which might infer large deviations in comparison with their \n\nabsolute content. \n\nIn order to bind SiO2 species in the anode, La2O3 phase was introduced into Ni - 8YSZ - CGO20 \n\nanode layer by wet impregnation of lanthanum nitrate followed by its subsequent decomposition; however, \n\nthis approach did not allow to achieve a reasonable performance (Fig. 5.4), possibly due to blocking of the \n\nelectrochemically active sites, hindering the gas diffusion with lanthanum oxide/silicate formed or negative \n\ninfluence of excessive La amounts in terms of the dissolution in CGO20 phase. \n\nComparing the performance of the cermet anodes on the apatite-based cells with literature data \n\npresented in Table 5.2, the level of the polarization resistances obtained in the present work is significantly \n\nlower in comparison with Ni - La9SrSi6O26.5 cermet (>1 kOhm\u00d7cm\n2 at 1023 K) [661] but is worse than that of \n\nNi - CGO20 (70-30 wt.%) on La10Si5.5Al0.5O26.75 (0.59 Ohm\u00d7cm\n2 at 1073 K) [566]. The better performance in \n\n\n\n202 \n \n\nthe latter reference might originate from differences in the electrode and electrolyte composition, fabrication \n\nprocedure as well as application of Pt paste on the anode surface. \n\nA noticeable optimization of the anode properties was achieved by addition of silver into the \n\ncermets. In particular, moderate quantities of Ag in Ni - CGO20 anode were found to have a positive \n\ninfluence on the electrochemical characteristics (Fig. 5.5), possibly due to a better adhesion of the anode to \n\nthe electrolyte and between the particles in the electrode layer which ensures a satisfactory percolation of the \n\nelectron-conductive phase and extended TPB. The promotion of the electrode properties by introducing \n\nmetallic silver has been demonstrated earlier on La0.5Sr0.4MnO3-? [666], La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-? [667] \n\nYBaCo4O7+? [668], La2Ni0.8Cu0.2O4+? [594], (La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-? [10] cathodes as well as on cermet [669, \n\n670] or alternative anodes [367, 671]; the improvement was primarily attributed to enhanced electronic \n\ntransport over the electrode layer and a contribution of Ag into the catalytic properties. \n\nAs shown in Fig. 5.5, the optimum performance is achieved when the total amount of metallic phase \n\nis 10 - 20 vol. %; in particular, the polarization resistance of Ag - Ni - CGO (10 - 10 - 80 vol. %) electrode \n\nwas found as low as ~2 Ohm\u00d7cm2 at 1073 K, substantially increasing under current. The activity may be \n\nfurther improved by distribution of submicron ceria particles over the anode layer using wet impregnation \n\ntechnique. However, increasing the content of CGO20 powder by mechanical mixing has a negative effect, \n\nindicating that apart from the composition of the anode layer, the activity is determined by microstructural \n\npeculiarities which depend on the preparation route. With respect to the presence of silver in the anode layer, \n\nexcessive amounts of Ag result in formation of large agglomerates (Fig. 5.3) deteriorating the electrode \n\nporosity, while a volatility of Ag [28] sufficiently limits the operational temperature range of the anode. \n\nThe presence of CGO20 in the cermet composition seems to be more beneficial in comparison with \n\n8YSZ in terms of the polarization behaviour. Although the literature data on the comparative electrocatalytic \n\nactivity of ZrO2- or CeO2-based conventional Ni cermet anode on commonly used electrolytes (YSZ-, CGO- \n\nor LaGaO3-?-based compositions) are contradictory, the overall level of the performance of cermets \n\ncontaining doped ceria or zirconia may be considered to be comparable [1, 7, 266]. Therefore, the higher \n\nperformance of Ni - CGO20 in the present work may be attributed to the difference in the preparation \n\nprocess, better electronic percolation in ceria-based anode under reducing conditions or to stronger \n\ndegradation of zirconia phase in contact with silicates. As shown by previous studies, silica has a tendency \n\ntowards accumulation at the grain boundaries of zirconia grains, dissolution in the fluorite structure or \n\nformation of ZrSiO4 phase, with resultant deterioration of the transport or mechanical properties [672-677]. \n\nIn turn, segregation of La2O3 from the apatite may promote the interaction with ZrO2-based solutions forming \n\nzirconate phases with suppressed ionic conductivity [642]. All these factors result in a strong degradation of \n\nthe conductivity and electrochemical activity of zirconia-containing electrodes applied onto the apatite \n\nelectrolytes.   \n\nIn order to ensure a better adhesion between the electrode and electrolyte layers and provide \n\nelectronic percolation through the anode, selected electrochemical cells were fabricated applying a layer of \n\nmetallic silver onto the apatite surface prior to deposition of the electrode layer. The details of the preparation \n\nof the corresponding anodes are given in Table 2.6. Selected SEM micrographs collected from the anode \n\nlayers or from the interface electrode/electrolyte are shown in Fig. 5.7. \n\n\n\n203 \n \n\nA \n\n \n\nB \n\n \n    \n\nC \n\n \n\nD \n\n \n \n\nFig. 5.7.

The lower Ohmic resistance enables \n\nto increase the range of currents used for the polarization tests without applying high voltages across the cell. \n\n \n\n0 15 30 45 60\n\ni, mA/cm2\n\n0\n\n300\n\n600\n\n900\n\n?\n, m\n\nV\n\nwithout interlayer\n973 K\n1023 K\n1073 K\n\ninterlayer: Ag\n973 K\n1023 K\n1073 K\n\nelectrolyte:\nLa10Si5AlO26.5\n\nelectrode:\nAg-CGO20 (40-60 vol.%)\n\n10% H\n2\n - H\n\n2\nO - N\n\n2\n\n \n0 40 80 120 160\n\ni, mA/cm2\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n?\n, m\n\nV\n\nas-prepared\n973 K\n\n1023 K\n\n1073 K\n\nNi-modified\n973 K\n\nAl2O3-Ag-CGO20 | Ag | La10Si5AlO26.5\n\n10% H2 - N2 - H2O\n\n \n\nFig. 5.8.

Polarization curves obtained for Al2O3 - Ag \n- CGO20 anodes in contact with La10Si5AlO26.5 with \nAg sublayer \n\n\n\n204 \n \n\nOn the other hand, the polarization resistance increases after application of the Ag layer (Fig. 5.8), \n\npossibly due to reduction of TPB by blocking with Ag particles or worse contact between the apatite and ion-\n\nconductive phase in cermet with resultant deterioration of the oxygen exchange between the cell components. \n\nAlthough some oxygen and hydrogen permeability have been reported for pure Ag or Ag-containing alloys \n\n[678, 679], this level is obviously insufficient to provide an adequate performance of the anodes. \n\nMore promising results were obtained after addition of Al2O3 to the electrode and subsequent \n\nimpregnation with Ni (Fig. 5.9). Since alumina is not expected to demonstrate any contribution into the \n\nelectronic/ionic transport or catalytic properties [26, 680] of the composites, the effect of Al2O3 might relate \n\nto formation of a mechanically-stable porous network, while the presence of Ag in the anode provides the \n\nconnectivity between particles. \n\nThe positive effect of application of Ag sublayer on the ohmic losses demonstrates that non-\n\nmodified cermet anode layers possess insufficient electronic conductivity to ensure a proper current \n\ncollection, while the improvement of the performance after introduction of Al2O3 shows that the parent \n\nmicrostructure does not provide a sufficient gas access to the electrochemically active sites. Optimizing the \n\nfraction of the components might enable to achieve a reasonable porosity and large TPB. However, the \n\nvalues of the polarization resistance still remain rather high, which limits the applicability of Ag-containing \n\nelectrode layers. \n\nLong-term performance tests carried out on Al2O3 - Ag - CGO20 cermet deposited onto \n\nLa10Si5AlO26.5 electrolyte with Ag interlayer showed a continuous degradation of the polarization resistance \n\nunder galvanostatic conditions which amounts to ~6% per 90 hours, although the data are rather scattered \n\n(Fig. 5.10). Even more serious deterioration was detected in terms of the Ohmic resistance; in particular, on \n\ninitial 10 hours the degradation rate was essentially high, followed by somewhat lower, but still significant \n\n(~30% per 90 hours) increase of the Ohmic losses. The latter phenomenon might primarily be associated with \n\nreduction of the ionic conductivity of the apatite materials with time [21]; however, the degradation of the \n\ntransport properties has been found to be negligible at the temperatures below 1073 K [648, 649]. \n\n \n\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n\ntime, h\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nR\n, O\n\nhm\n<\n\ncm\n2\n\n280\n\n320\n\n360\n\n400\n\n?\n, m\n\nV\n\nohmic resistance\npolarization resistance\n\nT = 973 K\n10%H\n\n2\n - N\n\n2\n - H\n\n2\nO\n\ni = 10 mA/cm2\n\nAl2O3-Ag-CGO | Ag | La10Si5AlO26.5\n\n \n\nFig. 5.10. Time dependencies of the overpotential, \npolarization and ohmic resistance of Al2O3 - Ag - \nCGO20 anodes with Ag sublayer \n\n\n\n205 \n \n\nOther possible origins of the degradation include microstructural features (i.e. detachment of the \n\nelectrode layer, electrode depletion with Ag due to vaporization, agglomeration of the metallic particles \n\nresulting in disruption of the electron-percolative network etc.) or accumulation of silica-based phases at the \n\nelectrode/electrolyte interface, as confirmed by EDS analysis. All these factors lead to an increase of both \n\npolarization and ohmic resistance. \n\nComparison of SEM micrographs of the Al2O3 - Ag - CGO20 electrode powders before and after the \n\nelectrochemical tests (Fig. 5.7 C and D) does not allow to make certain conclusions on the changes in the \n\ncermet morphology, suggesting that the performance deterioration is related primarily with the \n\nelectrode/electrolyte interface. \n\nSummarizing the results obtained on cermets anodes in contact with La10Si5AlO26.5 electrolyte, one \n\nmay infer that a reasonable amount in the anode layer of Ni and/or Ag is required in order to achieve an \n\nadequate performance. However, both components impose requirements on the operation conditions, \n\nprimarily in terms of microstructural features, phase stability, dimension behaviour etc. In order to evaluate \n\nthe potential of silicate-based materials for utilization as SOFC electrolytes, the following investigation is \n\nfocused on comparative studies of the electrochemical performance of perovskite anodes applied onto \n\nLa10Si5AlO26.5 and LSGM electrolytes. \n\n \n\n \n5.3. Electrochemical behaviour of oxide anodes in contact with LSGM and \n\nLa10Si5AlO26.5 solid electrolytes \n \n \n5.3.1. Comparison of oxide-based anode materials. Correlations of the electrochemical \n\nbehaviour and transport properties \n\n \n \n\nThe basic trends of the structural, transport and thermomechanical properties of selected perovskite-\n\nlike oxide materials were considered in Chapters 3 - 4, with the primary attention towards the effect of the \n\ncation composition on the functional characteristics, mechanism of the electronic/ionic transport, \n\nequilibration kinetics, etc.  The present part is devoted to a brief summarization and comparison of the \n\nproperties important for the electrochemical applications for the perovskites which exhibited the maximum \n\npotential for utilization as SOFC anodes.   \n\nAnalysis of XRD patterns under reducing atmospheres (Fig. 5.11) indicates that most perovskite \n\nmaterials may endure redox cycling in terms of the phase stability provided that a sufficient amount of \n\ncations with suppressed reducibility (Cr, Ti, Nb) is introduced into the perovskite structure. The presence of \n\nminor amounts of MnO phase which accompanies the reduction of manganite-based materials was \n\ndemonstrated not to affect significantly the transport and electrochemical properties, while the segregation of \n\nnano-scaled Ni particles from (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? or (Mg,Ni)O secondary phase at low p(O2) \n\nmay be beneficial in terms of the catalytic activity. Some precautions should be undertaken with respect to \n\nthe structural transitions exhibited by La-enriched (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-? and (La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-?; in particular, a \n\n\n\n206 \n \n\nslow equilibration kinetics and hysteresis behaviour observed on the former family of perovskites leads to \n\nmechanical degradation and limits their applicability in the electrochemical cells. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 5.11. Selected XRD patterns of the oxide anode materials after equilibration in atmospheric air and after \nreduction. The annealing conditions in reducing atmospheres are given in the legends. \n\n \n \n\nFor most studied materials the TEC values vary in the range (11 - 14)\u00d710-6 K-1 at 923 - 1223 K (Fig. \n\n5.12) and the perovskites are mechanically compatible with LSGM and La10Si5AlO26.5 electrolytes. The \n\ncompositional trends in the thermal expansivity generally correlate with the reducibility of the corresponding \n\noxides; in particular, increasing strontium and manganese concentrations in the perovskite lattice yields \n\nmoderately higher thermal expansion, although possible electron exchanges between the reducible species \n\nshould also be accounted for. For SrMn1-xNbxO3-? series, the Nb content should exceed 20 - 30 % in order to \n\navoid large expansion and decomposition of Mn-enriched representatives upon reduction. \n\nThe isothermal chemically-induced strains of (La,Sr)(Mn,Cr,Ti)O3-?, (La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-? and \n\n(La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-?-based compositions are within 0.6% on reducing p(O2) down to 10\n-21 - 10-12 atm (Fig. \n\n5.13). Decreasing Sr content lowers the chemical expansion as well as TEC values and improves the \n\nthermomechanical compatibility with the electrolyte materials. However, even for Sr-enriched \n\n(La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? with maximum strains the chemical expansion of 0.6% is not a critical factor, as \n\ndiscussed in Chapter 3.1.3, which enables to modify the transport and electrochemical properties of this \n\nperovskite series without a compromise with the stability or thermomechanical compatibility. \n\n\n\n207 \n \n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n\nx\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n?\n<\n\n10\n6 ,\n\n K\n-1\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\nE\n\na,\n k\n\nJ/\nm\n\nol\n\np(O\n2\n)=0.21 atm\n\n(La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-?\n(La1-xSrx)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-?\n(La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-?\nSrNb1-xMnxO3-?\n\np(O\n2\n)=(10-21-10-12) atm\n\n(La1-xSrx)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-?\n\n923-1223 K\n\n943-1263 K\n\n?=13.5<10-6 K-1\n\n?=12.5<10-6 K-1\n\nA\n\nB\n\n \n \n\nFig. 5.12.

Namely, plateau-like behavior is observed under oxidizing conditions when the \n\nvariations of the oxygen nonstoichiometry are minor, while the oxygen content is close to stoichiometric \n\nvalue. In accordance with the p-type electronic transport mechanism, in moderately reducing atmospheres the \n\nconductivity starts to drop with decreasing p(O2). As follows from the results of OP studies, the contribution \n\nof the ionic transport into the overall conductivity is negligible. The range of the oxygen partial pressures \n\nwhere the conductivity is essentially p(O2)-independent, expands on decreasing temperature as the oxygen \n\nnonstoichiometry variations decrease. In some cases, the conductivity at 1073 K is almost constant down to \n\np(O2) = 10\n-20 atm, though this behavior in the intermediate-temperature range may partly originate from \n\nkinetic factors. When considering the major effects of cation composition, it should first be mentioned that \n\nincorporation of B-site cations with relatively stable oxidation state, such as Ti or Nb, decreases the hole \n\nmobility and conductivity. Taking into account the trends in the stability and expansion behaviour, the \n\noptimum concentration of these species in the B-sublattice is within 40 - 60%. \n\n \n\n\n\n208 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 5.14. Oxygen partial pressure dependencies of the total conductivity at 1223 K and 1073 K \n\n \n\nIn accordance with previous studies [190, 195, 300], Sr-doping into the perovskites promotes the \n\nreducibility which is reflected by shifting the onset of the conductivity drop to more oxidative conditions. For \n\n(La1-xSrx)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? series, La-doping reduces the amount of the electronic charge carries and \n\nsimultaneously allows to extend the region of p(O2)-independent conductivity to more reductive \n\natmospheres; the resultant effect is that La content has no essential influence of the low-p(O2) conductivity. \n\nThe segregation of metallic nickel in reduced (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? has no substantial effect on \n\nthe transport properties as Ni content is small; the total conductivity of this material in reducing atmospheres \n\nis comparable to that of (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? and (La0.55Sr0.45)0.95Ti0.5Mn0.5O3-?. \n\nThe overall level of the conduction of the perovskites is as low as 1 - 30 S/cm in anode atmospheres \n\nin the temperature range 973 - 1173 K. An acceptable electronic transport at low p(O2) may be expected for \n\n(La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-?, (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? and selective representatives of Sr(Mn,Nb)O3-? and \n\n(La,Sr)(Mn,Cr,Ti)O3-? with moderate content of Nb or Ti. As for the transport properties in air and, \n\nconsequently, applicability as cathodes, La-rich La1-xSrxMn0.5Ti0.5O3-? and Nb-rich SrMn1-xNbxO3-? \n\nperovskites are quite inappropriate for electrochemical utilizations. \n\n\n\n209 \n \n\nThe maximum electrochemical activity among the perovskite anodes applied onto LSGM electrolyte \n\nwith protective CGO20 sublayer was observed for anodes with quite different cation compositions, which \n\ninclude (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr0.7Fe0.3O3-?, La0.5Sr0.5Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? and (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-?. The \n\nanodes provide quite similar overpotentials, at the level of ~150 mV under 100 mA/cm2 current density, \n\nwhich, however, are still higher compared to Ni-containing cermets (Fig. 5.15). The level of the anodic \n\npolarization resistance under OCV conditions of the most active electrode materials is as low as 1 - 2.5 \n\nOhm\u00d7cm2 which is quite comparable with the corresponding values reported for perovskite and perovskite-\n\nrelated alternative anode in literature (Table 5.5).

Data on Ni - 8YSZ - \nCGO anode [567] are demonstrated for \ncomparison. \n \n\n \n\nConsidering possible origins of the trends in the polarization behavior of the perovskite anodes, one \n\nshould emphasize the effects of the transport properties of the electrode materials, known from the literature. \n\nThe effect of the electronic conductivity on the electrode properties has been reported for numerous groups of \n\ncathode materials, especially in the case of limited current collection over the electrode layer due to \n\ninsufficient electronic transport (below 10 - 100 S/cm); this constriction is typical for doped manganites or \n\nperovskite-related groups containing \u201cinert\u201d cations in B-sublattice [681, 682]. However, one should take \n\ninto account that in (La,Sr)MnO3\u00b1? and related systems compositional modifications basically have a multiple \n\nand complex influence and may simultaneously affect the stability, electronic and ionic transport, the \n\nthermomechanical properties, compatibility with the electrolyte materials, etc [226, 266, 305, 310, 323]. \n\nTherefore, elucidating a single performance-determining factor is generally a complex procedure. \n\nAmong anode materials studied in literature, the effect of the electronic transport is more difficult to \n\ndetect, primarily due to low availability of the information on the transport properties of the electrode \n\nmaterials under appropriate conditions. In particular, for Ni - YSZ cermets, an acceptable level of the total \n\nconductivity is achieved only when the volume fraction of the metal exceeds the percolation threshold, i.e. 20 \n\n- 50 vol. % ([7, 266] and references cited). However, any variations in the content of the constituents in \n\ncomposites are accompanied by non-negligible microstructural changes, and an enrichment of the composite \n\n\n\n210 \n \n\nwith metallic phase beyond the optimum level basically leads to a drop of the performance. As shown in Fig. \n\n5.16, increasing Ni content above 30 vol.% in Ni - YSZ results in a gradual decrease of the Ohmic losses \n\nwhich reflects an improvement of the electronic transport of the anode layer. The polarization resistance, \n\nhowever, exhibits a minimum at 40 - 50 vol.% Ni [662]. Similar trends were detected for Cu-perovskite \n\ncermets [353]; the observation seems to be associated with strong sintering activity of Cu particles which \n\nmay hamper the gas access or reduce the TPB in the case of large fractions of the metallic component. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 5.16. Dependence of the Ohmic and \npolarization resistance for selected cermet \nanodes on the content of the metallic phase \n\n \n\n \n\nMore informative with this respect might be studies on oxide-based anodes (in particular, those \n\npossessing the perovskite or perovskite-related structure). However, tracing the correlations between the \n\nelectronic transport properties and electrode performance of such anodes is limited by low availability of the \n\nliterature data and strong differences between the anode component compositions, microstructure, fabrication \n\nroute, etc. which does not allow to elucidate the effect of the bulk properties of the electrode material. \n\nComparative studies on various anode materials with perovskite, fluorite, pyrochlore or tungsten bronze \n\nstructure revealed no obvious correlation between the low-p(O2) electronic conductivity and polarization \n\nresistance, although the Ohmic losses were generally lower for more conductive anode materials [683].

Moreover, the obvious trends are observed only within a \n\ngiven perovskite group, while the electrodes fabricated from the representatives belonging to other perovskite \n\nseries deviate from the correlation. This indicates that the electrode activity is substantially affected by some \n\nother factors. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 5.17. Correlation between the anodic \npolarization resistance and total conductivity of \nthe electrode materials. All dashed lines are a \nguide for the eye \n\n \n\nIn Table 5.6 the data on the linear chemical expansion of the perovskite materials on reduction in \n\nCO-CO2 flow and overpotential of the corresponding anodes are compared. The values demonstrate a \n\nreasonable correlation, although in some cases the comparison is complicated by differences between the \n\ncompositions subjected to dilatometric and electrochemical tests (for example, \n\n(La0.55Sr0.45)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.2Ti0.3O3-? and (La0.55Sr0.45)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.3Ti0.2O3-?, correspondingly). Nevertheless, the \n\nmonotonous behaviour of both the chemical strains and electrochemical activity with Sr doping allows to \n\nsuggest that the correlation between the thermomechanical and electrochemical properties should be \n\nsatisfied. As known from previous reports [686-688], for optimum and stable anode operation the linear \n\nchemical expansion should be within 0.2 - 0.25% . Among the materials studied, the values of the anode \n\noverpotential below 100 mW/cm2 under current of 60 mA/cm2 are observed for perovskites with the \n\nexpansivity lower 0.15 - 0.20%. \n\nOther factors which may influence the electrochemical behaviour include microstructural \n\nparticularities (in particular, differences in the sinterability behaviour in various perovskite families), ionic \n\ntransfer, catalytic activity, etc. In particular, for (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Fe0.1Ni0.05O3-?, the electrode performance \n\nmay be additionally promoted by the presence of nano-scaled Ni particles on the surface, while \n\ncomparatively high surface concentration of oxygen vacancies for Fe-doped chromites is also beneficial in \n\nterms of the electrochemical properties. Unfortunately, the data on the ionic conductivity or redox kinetics of \n\nthe perovskites studied only allow to qualitatively estimate an approximate level of possible contribution of \n\nthe bulk ionic transport or surface exchange into the overall electrode kinetics, without a certain prediction of \n\n\n\n213 \n \n\nthe trends under reducing conditions. Nevertheless, taking into account the apparently low level of the total \n\nconductivity (0.1 - 10 S/cm) under reducing conditions and the absence of any additives ensuring an \n\nappropriate current collection over the anode layer (in contrast to most data on the alternative anode materials \n\nreported in literature [8, 9, 16, 201], the electronic transport indeed seems to be a critical parameter \n\nresponsible for the electrode activity. \n\n \n\nTable 5.6.

Influence of anode layer microstructure on the electrochemical properties \n\n \n\nAs discussed in Chapter 4.2, the perovskites (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-? with La:Sr ratio close to 1 exhibit \n\nan optimum combination of the functional characteristics for application as SOFC anodes. Therefore, a \n\nparticular attention was drawn by cation-deficient (La0.55Sr0.45)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-?. However, due to a strong \n\ntendency of the perovskite towards grain growth (Fig. 4.22), the procedure of preparation of the electrode \n\nlayers should be carefully tuned. Micrographs in Fig. 5.18 represent typical microstructures of the electrode \n\nlayers prepared from (La0.55Sr0.45)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? powders processed in accordance with Table 2.4. \n\nIn accordance with the strong sinterability, (La0.55Sr0.45)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? powder without preliminary \n\ntreatment (\"coarse-1473\") showed formation of large (20 - 30 \u00b5 m) grains imaged in Fig. 5.18 B. For \n\ncomparison, much finer microstructure was observed (La0.85Sr0.15)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? powder prepared and \n\ndeposited under analogous conditions (Fig. 5.18 A). Since large particles are unfavorable in terms of \n\nrestricted surface area and poor percolation between the particles, the powder morphology was modified by \n\npreliminary grinding the electrode powder prior to coating. However, reducing the grain size caused a strong \n\ndensification of the electrode layer, providing an extremely poor porosity and limited gas access to the \n\nelectrochemically-active sites, as shown in Figs. 5.18 C and D. \n\n\n\n214 \n \n\nA \n\n \n \n\nB \n\n \n\nC \n\n \n \n\nD \n\n \nE \n\n \n \n\nF \n\n \n \nFig. 5.18.

The preparation procedure and abbreviations \nfor the electrode layers are given in Table 2.4. \n\n\n\n215 \n \n\nDiminishing the firing temperature of the \"fine\" electrodes suppressed the densification of the \n\nelectrode layer (Figs. 5.18 C, D, E), at the expense of a worse contact between the electrode layer and \n\nelectrolyte. As a result of the insufficient porosity of the electrode, the overpotential for the anodes prepared \n\nfrom \"fine\" powders enhanced by 4 - 5 times as compared to the \"coarse-1473\" anode layer (Fig. 5.19). \n\nIn order to avoid the strong sinterability of the electrode powder, an additional step was included in \n\nthe procedure of the electrode preparation, defined as \"passivated-1473\" in Table 2.4. Despite a possible \n\ndeterioration of the surface activity by the additional high-temperature step, the benefit of the preservation of \n\nthe porosity and at the same time suppressed formation of large grains (Fig. 5.18 F) in comparison with \n\n\"coarse-1473\" powder allowed to achieve the maximum electrochemical activity in the series (Fig. 5.19). \n\nNevertheless, the electrochemical activity of the electrodes still remains rather low which requires further \n\noptimization of the preparation conditions or modification of the anode composition. \n\n \n\n5.3.3. Current-induced activation of anodes \n\n \n\nAs mentioned in Chapter 4, Sr(Mn,Nb)O3-\u00f5 and (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-?-based anodes exhibit an \n\nimprovement of their electrode activity after polarization cycling. The decrease of the polarization resistance \n\nwas found to be as high as 35 - 40% for (La0.55Sr0.45)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? anode (Fig. 5.20), which necessitates \n\nelucidation of the factors responsible for the improvement. One should note that cathodic current-induced \n\nactivation has earlier been reported for (La,Sr)MnO3\u00b1?-based cathodes, attributable to generation of additional \n\noxygen vacancies at the surface [689, 690] or microstructural effects. In particular, in [691] formation of \n\nnanosized pores near the interface electrode/electrolyte after applying the polarization potential of 0.8 V for 3 \n\nhours was reported. Jiang et al. [692, 693] detected a transformation of large (La,Sr)MnO3\u00b1? agglomerates \n\ninto smaller granular-shaped particles with more distinct boundaries taking place at the electrode/gas and \n\nelectrode/electrolyte interfaces; applying the reverse current did not recover the initial microstructure. \n\n \n\n \n\n10 25 40 55 70\n\ni, mA/cm2\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n?\n, m\n\nV\n\ncycle 1\ncycle 2\ncycle 3\n\n1.0\n\n2.5\n\n4.0\n\n5.5\n\n-Z\n\",\n\n O\nhm\n\n<\ncm\n\n2\n\n0.0 1.5 3.0 4.5 6.0\n\nZ', Ohm<cm2\n\nbefore\npolarization\nafter 1st\n\ncycle\nafter 2nd\n\ncycle\nafter 3rd\ncycle\n\n(La0.55Sr0.45)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? | CGO20 | LSGM\n\n90 mHz\n\n7 kHz\n\n1073 K\n\n10% H\n2\n - N\n\n2\n - H\n\n2\nO\n\n \n\nFig. 5.20.

Inset shows corresponding changes in the \npolarization behaviour \n\n\n\n216 \n \n\nSome variations of the morphology and topography at the interface cathode/electrolyte after \n\npolarization were also observed [694]. The activation of (La,Sr)MnO3\u00b1? cathodes might also be related with \n\ncurrent-induced dissolution of surface impurities into the perovskite structure; such an improvement might be \n\nalternatively caused by preliminary moderate reduction of the cathode or exposure of the surface to dilute \n\nacid [311]. \n\nIn order to elucidate possible microstructural effects on the activation of the electrochemical \n\nbehaviour of (La0.55Sr0.45)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? anodes, several half-cells composed of \"passivated-1473\" anode \n\nlayers were fabricated using the technique described in Table 2.4 and subjected to several polarization runs \n\n(up to 700 mV) at 1073 K. The electrode morphologies for non-polarized anode layers and after 3 \n\npolarization cycles are compared in Fig 5.21. \n\nAlthough a certain microscopic analysis is complicated due to poor adhesion of pos-tested electrode \n\nlayers to the electrolyte which does not allow to compare adequately the interface between the cell \n\ncomponents, SEM of the non-polarized electrode showed the presence of large agglomerates (up to 15-20 \n\n\u00b5 m) of individual grains (Fig. 5.21 A) which might be responsible for the low electrochemical activity due to \n\ntheir poor percolation, low surface area, etc. After 3 polarization cycles one may observe a substantial \n\nreduction of the fraction of agglomerates and an increase of the amount of finer particles (Fig. 5.21 B). \n\nMoreover, in the latter case the particle size distribution becomes more uniform, while their form becomes \n\nmore spherical in comparison with the non-polarized electrode powder, as determined visually. The particles \n\nseem to form a more continuous network which ensures a more adequate current collection over the entire \n\nelectrode layer which might have a great impact on the electrochemical activity, especially taking into \n\naccount the insufficient electronic conductivity of (La0.55Sr0.45)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? under anode conditions. \n\nAt the same time, one should note that the microscopic differences are not distinct, while the \n\npolarization effect might be alternatively associated with modifications of the bulk or surface properties of \n\nthe electrode material. As an assumption, a slight oxidation of the perovskite might induce an enhancement \n\nof the electronic conductivity which is stabilized kinetically on subsequent cycles, in accordance with the \n\nslow equilibration exhibited by the materials.  \n\n \n \n\n  \n\nA B \n\nFig. 5.21.

The same conclusion can be \n\ndrawn from comparison of the polarization resistance values listed in Tables 5.5 and 5.7. In particular, the \n\npolarization resistance of (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? which showed the optimum performance among \n\nstudied perovskite anodes varies in the range 3 - 7 Ohm\u00d7cm2 at 1073 K on the apatite-type electrolyte, as \n\nshown in Fig. 5.23. The corresponding values for the same anode obtained on LSGM are as low as 1.0 - 1.5 \n\nOhm\u00d7cm2 (Fig. 5.24). \n\nThe effect of the anode material on the polarization behaviour is similar for both electrolytes and \n\nqualitatively follows the trends of the electronic conductivity of the corresponding perovskites. The level of \n\nthe polarization resistance of the perovskite anodes studied is somewhat higher in comparison with earlier \n\nreported data (Table 5.5); however, one should note that most previous results have been obtained on mixed-\n\nconducting anodes activated by distribution of Pt particles over the electrode surface. This alternatively \n\nindicates that the transport and catalytic properties of the anode material have a significant influence on the \n\nelectrode activity, irrespective of the electrolyte. \n\n \n\nTable 5.7.

The spectra are normalized for the electrode \narea and corrected for the Ohmic losses \n\n \n\n\n\n219 \n \n\nOn the other hand, the maximum difference between the performances of LSGM and La10Si5AlO26.5 \n\nelectrolyte is observed for more active anode materials, which reflects a strong contribution of additional \n\nlimitations relevant specifically to the apatite-type materials or related interfaces. One of possible \n\nexplanations of enhanced activity of the anodes in contact with LSGM might primarily be associated with the \n\ntransport properties of the electrolyte materials. As observed in numerous studies, the electrode polarization-\n\nrelated parameters show an obvious relationship with the bulk electrolyte resistivity originating from non-\n\nuniform current distribution due to discrete contacts between the porous electrodes and solid electrolyte or \n\nfrom an influence of the concentration of ionic and electronic charge carriers at the electrolyte surface on the \n\nexchange rate [584, 587, 695-697]. \n\nWhen the surface of the solid electrolyte is exposed to a reducing atmosphere or cation diffusion \n\nfrom the electrode, the enhanced amount of oxygen vacancies may directly contribute into the overall \n\nelectrochemical process; the latter phenomenon is primarily relevant to CeO2-?- and LaGaO3-?-based \n\nelectrolytes [567, 596, 597]. Another benefit of gallate-based electrolytes may be related with higher \n\ncontribution of the electronic conductivity in comparison with La10Si5AlO26.5, as shown in Table 5.1. This \n\nfactor is especially promoted by the dissolution of transition metal cations in the electrolyte matrix, as \n\nconfirmed by EDS results shown below. Nevertheless, the ionic transport in the electrolyte material cannot \n\nbe the unique origin of the poor electrochemical characteristics of the cells with La10Si5AlO26.5. For example, \n\nrelative anodes showed quite acceptable performance in contact with zirconia-based materials [8, 11, 177, \n\n184], contradictive to the trends in the ionic conductivity of the corresponding electrolytes. \n\nAs known from the literature [566, 594] and as demonstrated for cermet anodes, a worse activity of \n\nthe anode applied onto apatite-type electrolyte might relate to segregation and spreading of silica species \n\nalong the surfaces, grain boundaries of ceramics, interface anode/electrolyte, etc. Analyzing the literature \n\nreports on the chemical compatibility between the La10(SiO4)6O2-based phases with electrode materials, one \n\nmay emphasis formation of silicates Sr2SiO4 and Nd2SiO5 in contact with (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-? (annealed at \n\n1173 K) [566] and Nd2NiO4-? (1473 K) [659], respectively. In the latter case, Ni diffusivity caused \n\nsegregation of additional La4Ni3O10+? phase. However, most authors indicate that the strong reactivity is \n\ngenerally not typical for apatites in the temperature range corresponding to the cell preparation conditions \n\n[566, 591, 594], at least within the uncertainties of XRD analysis. \n\nAt the same time, a significant concern is caused by the cation interdiffusion between the cell \n\ncomponents; this is especially relevant to migration of Si and La into the electrodes or interlayers or an \n\nenrichment of the electrolyte with transition metal or alkali-earth cations. In particular, a low performance \n\nand degradation of the electrode properties for (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-? [566], Lan+1(Ni,Cu)nO3n+1 [591, 594] and \n\nGd0.6Ca0.4Mn0.9Ni0.1O3-? [591] cathodes were attributed to the presence of Si in the electrodes detected after \n\nthe cell preparation or electrochemical tests. Another important issue is associated with La diffusivity \n\nresulting from a gradient of the La chemical potential between the cell components. For apatite-type \n\nelectrolytes, this process is promoted by the presence of La2O3-related compounds which often accompany \n\nthe synthesis process or may be separated due to silica losses [21, 566]. One of concerns relates to \n\npenetration of La cations in CeO2-based phases with formation of (La,Ce)O2-? solutions with suppressed \n\ntransport properties, as has been detected between La10Si5.5Al0.5O26.75 and CGO20 at temperatures above \n\n\n\n220 \n \n\n1273 K [566]. Similar to most ionic conductors studied, the apatite structure enables a dissolution of \n\ntransition metal cations [566, 591, 594, 659]. While in moderate amounts this phenomenon does not seem to \n\nbe critical, the diffusivity of alkali-earth cations might be undesirable due to a possible decrease of the \n\namount of interstitial oxygen species or formation of CaO-SiO2 or SrO-SiO2 blocking layers [591, 698]. \n\nConsidering the chemical compatibility of gallate electrolytes with electrode materials, one should \n\nnote that a direct contact of LSGM with materials containing transition metal species, both in metallic or \n\ncation state, should be avoided due to a possible cation diffusion and dissolution in the gallate lattice. In \n\nparticular, penetration of Fe, Co, Ni and to some extent Mn cations into LSGM may induce their substitution \n\nfor Ga and cause a segregation of LaSrGa3O7, LaSrGaO4, LaNiO3-? or other interfacial phases with poor \n\ntransport properties [699-703]. Depletion of LSGM with Ga due to the vaporization processes [30, 633], \n\ninteraction with Pt contacts [581, 633] or Ga diffusion into the electrode phase [700] may also represent a \n\nproblem in terms of the stability and ionic conduction of the electrolyte material. Large gradients of the \n\nchemical potential of La between the cell components may lead to their undesirable enrichment or depletion \n\nwith La and/or accumulation of the corresponding decompositions products at the interfaces [278, 703]. At \n\nthe same time, one should note that in the case of adequate fabrication and processing conditions of the cell, \n\nthe degradation phenomena taking place in LSGM-based cells are not substantial in comparison with those \n\ntypical for apatite-type electrolytes [21, 594, 659]. \n\nIn accordance with numerous studies, the problem of the cation diffusivity may be suppressed by \n\npreliminary deposition of protective layers onto the electrolyte surface. For this purpose, a wide application \n\nhas been received by ceria-based layers, preferentially in the porous form in order to provide additional \n\ncatalytically active centers and extend the electrochemical zone. Table 5.8 represents selected literature data \n\non the effect of the protective layer on the polarization-related parameters of cathodes and anodes. For some \n\nelectrode/electrolyte couples, the presence of the sublayer reduces the polarization resistance by 1 - 2 orders, \n\nalthough the Ohmic losses may exhibit an increase. This requires reduction of the sublayer thickness down to \n\na definite level (below 5 - 10 \u00b5 m) which effectively prevents the diffusion processes and provides a \n\nminimum Ohmic resistance. \n\nIn order to confirm that a contamination of anode layers with silica and/or a possible cation \n\nexchange between the cell components are primarily responsible for the electrochemical behaviour observed, \n\nthe following studies were carried out on the cells composed of similar electrodes/electrolytes; the unique \n\ndifference being the presence/absence of protective CGO20 sublayer. The electrochemical tests were \n\ncombined with EDS analysis performed on the layers near the interface. The conditions of the sublayer \n\ndeposition are described in Chapter 2. \n\nA positive effect of the CGO20 sublayer was demonstrated for anodes/cathodes on LSGM and \n\nLa10Si5AlO26.5 electrolytes; selected examples of the improved electrochemical behaviour are shown in Fig. \n\n5.25. The improvement was essentially pronounced for Mn- or Cr-enriched perovskites confirming the strong \n\ndiffusivity of Mn and Cr species, although this phenomenon might be alternatively attributed to enhanced \n\nelectrochemical activity of the corresponding electrodes and their higher susceptibility towards the \n\nmodifications. \n\n\n\n221 \n \n\nTable 5.8.

EDS spectra of \n(La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? grains in the bulk phase and at the interface with La10Si5AlO26.5 electrolyte \n(C). \n\n \n\n\n\n223 \n \n\nIn the case of the direct contact between the electrode and electrolyte, the most obvious change in \n\nthe element composition is associated with chromium migration into the apatite phase. As discussed in \n\nChapter 1.2.7, a contamination of cell components with Cr proceeds via bulk/surface diffusion mechanism or \n\ninvolves a participation of volatile CrOx(OH)y compositions deposited at the electrolyte surface [82, 83, 285, \n\n288]. As the intensity of the peaks attributable to La and Cr is substantially reduced at the interfacial layers of \n\nthe electrode, the diffusion mechanism seems to be dominant in the present case, since vaporization-induced \n\nchromium losses from the electrode layers contacting with the electrolyte should be comparable or even \n\nsuppressed in comparison with those at the electrode/gas interface. \n\nSome changes were also found for Ni-related signal. A decrease in its intensity observed for \n\n(La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? phase close to the interface confirms the diffusivity of Ni into the apatite \n\nphases, in accordance with [594, 659], although a comparison of the relative depletion of the perovskite with \n\nCr and Ni is complicated due to the low intensity of the Ni peak. No enrichment of the apatite phase with Ni \n\nwas detected, presumably due to a low Ni content in the parent perovskite. Analysis of Si distribution is \n\ncomplex due to a strong overlapping of Si and Sr peaks. One may observe a change of the symmetry and \n\nintensity of the corresponding peak in both contacting phases close to the interface; the character of the \n\nchanges indicates a possible depletion of the apatite with Si and an enrichment with Sr. \n\nNo obvious differences in the cation distribution over the apatite phase were found for the cell \n\ncontaining a protective layer of CGO20 (Fig. 5.26 B) indicating that the differences in the spectra in Fig. 5.26 \n\nA and C indeed demonstrate the cation interdiffusion. Although the performance of the cells containing a \n\nsublayer applied onto La10Si5AlO26.5 electrolyte is somewhat improved in comparison with analogous cells \n\nwhere the electrode and electrolyte are in the direct contact (Fig. 5.25), the electrochemical activity is still \n\npoor. Unfortunately, due to a small thickness and high porosity of the CGO20 layer, no adequate data on the \n\ncation distribution over the interface apatite/ceria might be collected from the respective area. In accordance \n\nwith [566, 594], La and/or Si cations might have a tendency to accumulate in the sublayer or electrolyte layer \n\nclose to the interface, suppressing the ionic transfer and electrochemical activity. \n\nThe results of the elemental analysis, carried out on analogous LSGM-based cells are qualitatively \n\nsimilar to those obtained for the apatite-based cells (Fig. 5.27). In the case of direct contact of LSGM \n\nelectrolyte with chromite-based electrode, one may observe a strong enrichment of the electrolyte region \n\nclose to the electrode with Cr and simultaneous reduction of the Cr-related peak on the spectrum of the \n\nelectrode phase close to the interface in comparison with the bulk (Fig. 5.27 A and C). No presence of Ni \n\nspecies which might be detrimental in terms of the transport properties of the gallate [635, 701] was detected \n\nin LSGM phase, although this also might be associated with the small (5%) content of Ni in the electrode \n\nphase. Gallium exhibits an accumulation at the electrolyte-contacting layer of the electrode resulted from Ga \n\ndiffusion or evaporation of Ga-containing species with subsequent deposition. \n\nApplication of CeO2-based sublayer suppresses the interdiffusion between the electrode and LSGM \n\nelectrolyte; an example is demonstrated in Fig. 5.27 B. No visible differences between the bulk electrolyte \n\nphase and the region close to the interface between the cell components were detected, within the \n\nuncertainties of the elemental analysis. As for the corresponding changes in the electrode, a certain analysis is \n\ncomplicated due to the porosity of the layer and problems of determination of the distinct boundary between \n\n\n\n224 \n \n\nthe CGO20 and (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? layers which, in particular, results in appearance of small \n\npeaks related to Ce or Gd in the perovskite phase. \n\nAs a result of the contamination of the electrode layer with silica and/or cation interdiffusion \n\nbetween the components, the cells containing the apatite as solid electrolyte exhibit a rapid degradation. As \n\nshown in Fig. 5.28 A, after exposure of (La0.55Sr0.45)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.3Ti0.2O3-? anode to polarization cycling under \n\noverpotentials of 500 - 800 mV, the polarization and Ohmic resistance exhibit an irreversible increase, equal \n\nto~25% and 50%, respectively, despite the presence of the protective CGO20 layer. An application of similar \n\noverpotentials on the same cells with LSGM solid electrolyte induces only a ~5% increase of the polarization \n\nresistance, without visible changes of the Ohmic losses. One should note that in the latter case the \n\ntemperature was as high as 1073 K which should promote the degradation processes. The results demonstrate \n\na poor tolerance of the electrochemical cells based on apatite-type electrolytes towards the SOFC operation \n\nconditions, in accordance with previously reported data [591, 594, 659-661]. \n\n \n\n4 5 6 7 8\n\nI,\n a\n\n.u\n.\n\n4 5 6 7 8 9\nE, keV\n\nelectrode:\n(La\n\n0.9\nSr\n\n0.1\n)\n\n0.95\nCr\n\n0.85\nMg\n\n0.1\nNi\n\n0.05\nO\n\n3-?\n\nbulk\n\nnear the interface with\nLSGM (direct contact)\n\nelectrolyte: LSGM\nbulk\n\nnear the interface with\n\n(La\n0.9\n\nSr\n0.1\n\n)\n0.95\n\nCr\n0.85\n\nMg\n0.1\n\nNi\n0.05\n\nO\n3-?\n\n(direct contact)\n\n4 5 6 7 8\n\nelectrolyte: LSGM\nbulk\n\nnear the interface with\n(La\n\n0.9\nSr\n\n0.1\n)\n\n0.95\nCr\n\n0.85\nMg\n\n0.1\nNi\n\n0.05\nO\n\n3-?\n\n(with CGO20 sublayer)\n\nLa\n\nLa\n\nLa\n\nLa\n\nLa\nLa\n\nLa\n\nLa\n\nLa\n\nLa\n\nLa\n\nCr\n\nNi\n\nCr\n\nGa\n\nLa\n\nLa\n\nLa\n\nLa\nLa\n\nLa\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\n \n \nFig. 5.27.

Impact of infiltrated additives on anode activity \n \n\n \nAs shown in Table 5.5, the level of the polarization resistance of the perovskite-based anodes \n\nexceeds 1 - 2 Ohm\u00d7cm2 at 1073 K which is rather high for electrochemical applications and indicates \n\nconstrictions related with a non-adequte current collection or insufficient electrocatalytic activity. In order to \n\nimprove the performances, subsequent optimization steps are required; one of those relates to wet \n\nimpregnation of the anode layer with catalytically-active additions such as CeO2-? and Ni. Fig. 5.29 \n\ndemonstrates the effect of CeO2-\u00f5 and Ni additions into selected anode layer on their electrochemical \n\nbehaviour, while the microstrucutures of modified layers are shown in Fig. 5.30. In particular, Figs. 5.30 G, \n\nH represent formation of submicron ceria particles inside the porous structure of SrMn0.6Nb0.4O3-? anodes. \n\nImpregnation of Ni-containing solutions into the porous (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? layer did \n\nnot demonstrate a substantial activating effect indicating that the amount and distribution of the Ni metallic \n\nparticles separated from the perovskite lattice at low p(O2) is close to the optimum level and further additions \n\nof Ni is non-effective. On the other hand, the performance may be substantially improved by infiltration of \n\nceria particles into the anode, yielding the current densities as high as ~55 and ~140 mA/cm2 at 973 K and \n\n1073 K, respectively, under the anodic overpotential of 80 mV (Fig.5.29). \n\nThe preferential incorporation of CeO2-? phase in comparison with Ni, combined with the reasonable \n\nperformance observed for \u201cpure\u201d layer of (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? allows to suggest that the \n\nmaterial possesses a satisfactory electronic conductivity and catalytic activity towards hydrogen oxidation \n\n\n\n226 \n \n\nrequired for an adequate anode activity, while the ionic transport-related parameters, in particular, the surface \n\nconcentration of the oxygen vacancies are insufficient; this problem may be overcome by the distribution of \n\nceria particles over the anode surface. In contrast, the low electronic and ionic conductivity as well as poor \n\nelectrocatalytic activity of representatives of (La1-xSrx)0.95Mn0.5Cr1-xTixO3-? or Sr(Mn,Nb)O3-? series makes it \n\npossible to optimize the performance via incorporation of both CeO2-? and Ni phases. \n\nThe activating effect is similar to additions of praseodimia phase into cathode layers demonstrated in \n\nChapters 3.1.7 and 3.3.3. A positive influence of the wet impregnation or other techniques of incorporating \n\nthe catalytically-active species has been demonstrated in numerous studies [7, 107, 266, 352, 365, 567]; with \n\nrespect to the electrode layers studied in the present work, the effect may primarily relate to microstructural \n\noptimization, enhanced electrode surface area and TPB, promotion of the transport properties and the \n\ncatalytic activity of the electrode material, etc. \n\nConsidering that the wet impregnation may provide a sufficient and uniform distribution of the \n\nelectrochemically-active components over the anode layer utilizing comparatively small quantities of the \n\nprecursors, this approach may also be regarded to be beneficial in terms of reducing the costs of the electrode \n\nmaterials and fabrication techniques in comparison with many other methods of the deposition of the \n\nelectrode layers, if related to the same power output of the electrochemical cells. However, introduction of \n\ndissolved cations into the electrode layers requires an additional high-temperature step which may cause \n\nmicrostructural or thermomechanical problems after thermal/redox cycling. With this respect, preliminary \n\nintroduction of the electrochemically active components into the oxide matrix and subsequent in-situ \n\ngeneration of the electrochemically active sites might be more beneficial, as shown for \n\n(La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? perovskite in the present study and for Ni- or Ru-doped analogues in \n\nliterature [15, 186, 544]. \n\n \n\n5 15 25 35 45 55\n\ni, mA/cm2\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n?\n, m\n\nV\n\n(La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-?\n1073 K\n\nas-prepared\nCeO2-modified\n\nCeO2-, Ni-modified\n\n(La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-?\n973 K\n\nas-prepared 0  CeO2-modified\n\nelectrolyte: LSGM\n\n \n\nFig. 5.29.

Final remarks \n \n \n\nThe results obtained on electrochemical cells with gallate- and silicate-based solid electrolytes show \n\nthat irrespective of their comparable and reasonably high ionic conductivity, the electrochemical \n\nperformances of the anodes on these electrolytes is quite different. This indicates that the activity is primarily \n\ndetermined by the tolerance of the electrolyte material towards the environmental conditions and \n\ncompatibility with the electrodes rather than by intrinsic transport properties of the electrolyte composition. \n\nIn particular, a strong effect of cation interdiffusion was observed, less pronounced at the presence of \n\nprotective CGO20 layer. With respect to the behavior observed, a serious degradation of the electrochemical \n\nproperties occurs due to contamination of the electrode surface, catalytically-active sites, etc. with silica in \n\nthe case of apatite-type electrolyte. \n\n The electrode activity of perovskite-like anodes correlates with the low-p(O2) electronic \n\nconductivity and chemical expansivity of the corresponding materials on redox cycling. Nevertheless, the \n\ncorrelation is not strictly linear and shows significant deviations if comparing the electrochemical properties \n\nof various perovskite groups. This indicates that some other factors such as the surface gas exchange kinetics \n\nor oxygen vacancy diffusion may be responsible for the anode activity. \n\nThe performance of both cermet and perovskite-like electrodes might be considerably improved by \n\ninfiltration of catalytically active ceria or nickel particles into the electrode layer. The effect is especially \n\npronounced for CeO2-\u00f5 introduction indicating the limitations associated with the catalytic activity of the \n\nperovskite anodes or surface vacancy concentration. Nevertheless, even for the most active anodes the \n\nperformance was obtained insufficient for practical applications. This indicates the necessity of subsequent \n\noptimization of the functional characteristics of the electrode and electrolyte materials or cell preparation \n\nprocedure. \n\n \n\n\n\n229 \n \n\nConclusions \n\n \nThe study was focused on the development of cathode and anode materials based on perovskite-like \n\nchromite, manganite and titanate materials. The task indicated involved evaluation of phase and structural \n\nrelationships, transport, thermomechanical and electrochemical characteristics of the oxide materials studied. \n\nAnother purpose was related with determination of the principal performance-determining factors and search \n\nof approaches allowing to optimize the performance of the electrochemical cells considered. Based on the \n\nresults obtained, the following conclusion can be drawn from the study: \n\n1. In perovskites (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-? titanium may partially or completely substitute for \n\nchromium cations provided that the doping is accompanied by introduction of the equivalent  amount of Sr \n\ninto A-sublattice. The phase and structural stability as well as the transport and electrochemical properties \n\nunder oxidizing conditions are quite tolerant towards the substitution. Enhanced generation of the oxygen \n\nvacancies upon redox cycling, more pronounced for Sr- and Ti-enriched compositions, leads to larger thermal \n\nand chemical expansion. However, the main drawback related with the introduction of Sr and Ti refers to the \n\nstrong drop of the electronic conductivity under the anode conditions resulting in a worse electrochemical \n\nbehavior.  \n\n2.  (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? perovskites possess an enhanced ionic conduction under reducing \n\nconditions as compared with most chromite-based materials, which might to some extent be responsible for \n\ntheir promising anode activity. Nevertheless, the electronic conductivity seems have a more pronounced \n\ninfluence on the electrode properties, taking into account the correlation between the low-p(O2) conductivity \n\nand anode performance for the compositions with various Fe content.   \n\n3. Insufficient solubility of Ni in (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? perovskite and/or the presence of the \n\nimpurity (Ni,Mg)O ensures the separation of metallic Ni nano-sized particles which promote an enhanced \n\nelectrochemical performance of the corresponding anodes. \n\n4. Doping (La1-xSrx)1-yMn0.5Ti0.5O3-? and SrMn1-xNbxO3-? with donor-like cations improves their tolerance \n\ntowards reduction. However, lower concentration of p-type charge carriers in La- and Nb-enriched \n\ncompositions, respectively, significantly deteriorates their electronic conduction. As a result, the perovskites \n\nSrMn1-xNbxO3-? showed poor cathodic and anodic performance, while the anode based on \n\nLa0.5Sr0.5Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? oxide, moderately doped with donor-like cations, exhibited an adequate activity \n\nwithout additional modifications. One should note that La-enriched (La1-xSrx)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? (? = 0.75 - \n\n0.85) are characterized by the phase transitions and slow equilibration kinetics upon variations of the oxygen \n\nnonstoichiometry resulting in a strong hysteresis, degradation of the transport properties and ceramics \n\nintegrity which restricts their applicability as anodes. \n\n5. Despite the sufficient and comparable level of the ionic conductivity in LSGM and La10Si5AlO26.5, \n\nwhich exceeds that in ZrO2-based materials, the electrochemical characteristics of the cells composed of the \n\ncorresponding electrolytes are substantially different. This indicates that the electrode activity is primarily \n\ngoverned by the stability of the electrolyte material under operation conditions and the compatibility between \n\nthe cell components. The performance of anodes applied onto the apatite-type electrolyte is poor, presumably \n\nowing to the contamination with silica and resultant blocking of the electrochemically-active sites. The \n\n\n\n230 \n \n\nelectrode properties may be to some extent optimized by compositional or microstructural modifications, in \n\nparticular, by impregnation with solutions of catalytically-active species, however the activity still remains \n\ninadequate, especially in terms of the long-term performance.  \n\n6. The electrochemical behavior is significantly affected by the cation interdiffusion between the cell \n\ncomponents, especially in the case of the direct contact, without the application of protective layers. \n\nAlthough the cation exchange is typical for the cells containing both gallate- and silicate-based electrolytes, \n\nin the latter case the influence of diffusion on the electrochemical characteristics is more critical. The \n\ninterdiffusion and interaction phenomena can be reduced by utilization of CeO2-based sublayer between the \n\nelectrolyte and electrode rendering an improvement of the electrochemical properties. In particular, the \n\npolarization resistance of some perovskite-based anodes may be diminished down to 1 - 1.5 Ohm\u00d7cm2 at \n\n1073 K under zero current. \n\n7. The activity of most perovsite-based anodes generally correlates with the electronic conductivity trends, \n\nconsistently with the insufficient hole transport under the operation conditions. Another factor that apparently \n\naffets the electrochemical properties relates to the chemical expansivity of the anode material on redox \n\ncycling. On the other hand, the correlation is not strict and one may observe deviations between various \n\ncompositional series which indicates the effect of other factors such as surface exchange kinetics, oxygen \n\ndiffusion-related parameters, etc.  \n\n8. The electrode activity may be improved by introducing catalytically-active agents such as CeO2-? and/or \n\nNi (for anodes) and PrOx (for cathodes). The most pronounced effect is observed upon addition of ceria into \n\nthe anode layer which suggests the electrode limitations associated with the catalytic activity of the \n\nperovskites studied, surface concentration of oxygen vacancies, etc. Despite the improvement, the electrode \n\nperformance still remains on the level, insufficient for practical utilization which requires further \n\noptimization of the electrode preparation proceduce, selection of the functional materials, etc. \n\n9. For La10Si5AlO26.5-based electrochemical cells a substantial raise of the ohmic and polarization losses \n\nwas observed. The degradation was especially pronounced at a large (>500 mV) anode polarization. The \n\nelectrodes in contact with LSGM electrolyte possess a higher stability, while some manganite-based anode \n\nexhibit an improvement in terms of the activity after polarization cycling. However, thermal cycles cause an \n\nenlargement of both ohmic and polarization resistance which necessitates an optimization of the contact \n\nbetween the cell components. \n\n\n\n231 \n \n\nList of references \n\n \n\n1.

XRD patterns of (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-\u00f5 ceramics collected at various temperatures. Inset \nshows XRD at different temperatures for the peaks around 32.5o (blue and red vertical lines correspond to \ntheoretical positions of orthorhombic and rhombohedral phase, respectively). \n \n \n \n\nHigh-temperature XRD measurements were carried out at the North Carolina A&amp;T State University \n\nby Dr. S.N. Yarmolenko and Prof. J. Sankar. The details on the equipment utilized, measuring conditions etc \n\nmay be found in Chapter 2 or [708]. \n\nAs noted in Chapter 3.3.1, LaCrO3-based compositions exhibit a transformation of the low-\n\ntemperature orthorhombic structure into the rhombohedral one stable occurring on heating in air. The \n\ntransition temperature is governed by the radius of dopant cations; examples are shown in Table 3.13. Fig. \n\nA1 demonstrates an evolution of XRD patterns collected on (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-\u00f5 ceramics \n\nequilibrated at several temperatures with the step of 3 K in the range 318 - 369 K. Analysis of the XRD data \n\nshows that the transition orthorhombic - rhombohedral occurs at the temperatures around 350 K. A close \n\nvalue was observed by dilatometric measurements carried out on continuous heating of a ceramic sample in \n\nair, as demonstrated in Fig. 3.28. \n\nOn further heating in the range 373 - 1073 K the rhombohedral phase retains, as shown in Fig. A2. \n\nThe parameters a and c in hexagonal settings calculated from the patterns linearly increase upon heating, as \n\ndemonstrated in Fig. 3.28. The average TEC for the parameter c is more than twice larger in comparison with \n\nthat for the parameter a (15.3\u00d710-6 K-1 vs. 7.0\u00d710-6 K-1), while the ratio c/a gradually increases on heating \n\nindicating an anisotropy along [001] direction. The average linear TEC calculated from the high-temperature \n\nXRD data is evaluated as 9.8\u00d710-6 K-1 which is slightly lower in comparison with the value obtained from the \n\ndilatometric studies in the same temperature range (10.1\u00d710-6 K-1). More details on the structural behaviour \n\nof the perovskite (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-\u00f5 may be found in [708]. \n\n \n\n\n\n258 \n \n\n \n \n\n30 40 50 60 70 80\n\n57 58 59\n\n3\n,0\n\n,0\n\n2\n,1\n\n,4\n\n0\n,1\n\n,8\n\n2?
