Prudent policy-making by the UAE Federal \n\nGovernment was vital in providing proper guidance on the how, where and \n\nwhen to apply hydrocarbon revenues and support the much needed process of \n\neconomic diversification. Due to its astonishing economic development the UAE \n\nhas become a role model in economic diversification for oil-producing countries. \n\nIn this sense, the present Master\u2019s Final Work sheds light on the following \n\nresearch question - \u201cWhat were the policies adopted by the United Arab Emirates \n\nFederal Government that made the Emirates economy a case of success?\u201d. \n\n \n\nA \u201ctwo building-block\u201d rationale was adopted in order to address the research \n\nquestion at hand. The first \u201cbuilding-block\u201d allowed us to verify that the UAE is \n\na case of economic success. Within 44 years, the country has now one of the most \n\ncompetitive economies in the world and is at par with most advanced economies \n\nin terms business regulations, infrastructure and technological advancement. \n\nThe second \u201cbuilding-block\u201d focused on the understanding of the UAE\u2019s Federal \n\nGovernment policies that fostered such success. By adopting the single-case \n\nstudy methodology it was possible to verify that within the UAE\u2019s set of \n\nmacroeconomic policies, diversification played a leading role and has allowed \n\nthe economy to divest away from hydrocarbons dependence. Trade, Investment, \n\nFiscal and Monetary policies have worked as tools to foster and promote both \n\neconomic growth and diversification.  \n\n \n\nKeywords: United Arab Emirates; Economy; Development; Policies  \n\n \n\n\n\n vi \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n vii \n\nResumo \n\nEm apenas 44 anos os Emirados \u00c1rabes Unidos (EAU) progrediram de uma \n\neconomia de subsist\u00eancia para uma economia orientada para a inova\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\nconsumo em massa. A formula\u00e7\u00e3o de pol\u00edticas econ\u00f3micas pelo Governo Federal \n\ndos EAU tornou-se fulcral para direcionar a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de receitas provenientes \n\nda explora\u00e7\u00e3o de petr\u00f3leo e apoiar o processo de diversifica\u00e7\u00e3o da economia. Os \n\nEAU tornaram-se assim num modelo de diversifica\u00e7\u00e3o econ\u00f3mica a seguir por \n\npa\u00edses produtores de petr\u00f3leo. Neste sentido, o presente Trabalho Final de \n\nMestrado tem como intuito abordar a seguinte quest\u00e3o de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o \u2013 \u201cQuais \n\nforam as pol\u00edticas adotadas pelo Governo Federal dos EAU que tornaram a \n\neconomia dos Emirados num caso de sucesso?\u201d. \n\n \n\nDe modo a endere\u00e7ar a quest\u00e3o de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o mencionada, foi adotada uma \n\nl\u00f3gica bipartid\u00e1ria constitu\u00edda por dois momentos chave. Assim, num primeiro \n\nmomento foi poss\u00edvel analisar e verificar que a economia dos EAU constitui um \n\ncaso de sucesso. Em apenas 44 anos os Emirados det\u00eam uma das economias mais \n\ncompetitivas a n\u00edvel mundial, estando j\u00e1 em igualdade com as economias \n\navan\u00e7adas. Num segundo momento foram analisadas as pol\u00edticas delineadas \n\npelo Governo Federal dos EAU que promoveram o caso de sucesso. Atrav\u00e9s da \n\nado\u00e7\u00e3o metodol\u00f3gica de um \u00fanico estudo de caso, foi poss\u00edvel verificar que de \n\num conjunto de pol\u00edticas macroecon\u00f3micas apresentadas, a diversifica\u00e7\u00e3o \n\necon\u00f3mica desempenhou um papel predominante. J\u00e1 o conjunto de pol\u00edticas \n\ncomerciais, investimento, fiscais e monet\u00e1rias funcionaram como catalisadores \n\ndo crescimento econ\u00f3mico e processo de diversifica\u00e7\u00e3o da economia dos EAU. \n\nPalavras \u2013 Chave: Emirados \u00c1rabes Unidos; Economia; Desenvolvimento; \n\nPoliticas \n\n\n\n viii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n ix \n\nContents \n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS ...................................................................................................

Introduction \n\n \n\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) was established as a Federation of 7 emirates \n\nin December 1971, no more than 44 years ago. The country emerged against the \n\nbackdrop of poverty and socio-economic underdevelopment. With a population \n\nof no more than 180,000 inhabitants in 1968, the UAE was still deeply marked by \n\nits subsistence economy which was characterized by agriculture, pearling \n\nextraction, fishing and trading activities (Al Abed, 2001; Butt, 2001). \n\nInfrastructures during the late 1960\u2019s were barely non-existent and the Trucial \n\nStates \u2013 the present UAE \u2013 relied on foreign monetary aid to begin its elusive \n\nsocio-economic development. Yet, within 44 years the UAE was able to evolve \n\nfrom a subsistence economy into an innovation-driven economy (World \n\nEconomic Forum [WEF], 2015a). \n\n \n\nAt the outset of 2015 the UAE has 9,6 million inhabitants and is considered the \n\n17th most competitive economy in the world by the World Economic Forum, \n\n(International Monetary Fund [IMF], 2016; WEF, 2015a). The country achieved \n\nrecord-breaking growth rates and was able to increase its Real Gross Domestic \n\nProduct from United States Dollar (USD) 27, 545 billion in 1972 to USD 249, 578 \n\nbillion in 2014 (Wam, 2014; United Nations, 2015). The UAE is now at par with \n\nthe world\u2019s advanced economies in terms of macroeconomic environment, \n\ninfrastructure, technological advancement and innovation (WEF, 2015a). The \n\n\n\n 18 \n\ncountry even has the tallest infrastructure in the world, the 878 meter-high Burj \n\nKhalifa.  \n\n \n\nUndoubtedly hydrocarbon resources played a major role in \u201cfeeding\u201d the \n\neconomic development. However, prudent policy-making by the UAE Federal \n\nGovernment was also crucial in providing proper guidance and use of such \n\nnatural resource endowments. Due to its achievements, the UAE is now a role-\n\nmodel for the oil-producing countries (Hvidt, 2013). It is in light of the \n\naforementioned that it becomes increasingly relevant to understand the policies \n\nthat guided the UAE\u2019s economic success. In this regard, the present study intends \n\nto shed light on the following research question - \u201cWhat were the policies \n\nadopted by the United Arab Emirates Federal Government that made the \n\nEmirates economy a case of success?\u201d. \n\n \n\nTo address the present research question a \u201ctwo building-block\u201d rationale was \n\nadopted. The first \u201cbuilding-block\u201d will focus on understanding why does the \n\nUAE constitute a case of economic success. The second \u201cbuilding-block\u201d will \n\ndelve deeper into the understanding of the UAE\u2019s framework of policies that \n\npropelled such success. Additionally, the time frame of the present work will be \n\nfrom 1971 to 2015. Such an extensive period was required in order to understand \n\nthe extent of the UAE\u2019s success and the impact of the economic policies adopted \n\nby the Federal Government. \n\n \n\nIn order to address the first \u201cbuilding-block\u201d and understand how the UAE \n\nbecame a case of economic success, it will be necessary to (1) understand the \n\nUAE\u2019s economic past by taking a more qualitative approach and look at the \n\ncountry\u2019s history in the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s; (2) identify and comprehend the \n\nfeatures of the economy (both past and present); (3) analyze how the UAE \n\n\n\n 19 \n\nachieved such economic growth by looking at its economic performance; (4) \n\nidentify the main drivers (or key-sectors) that propelled such economic \n\nperformance, and (5) assess the extent of the UAE\u2019s current economic success \n\nwhen compared to world economies. \n\n \n\nThe second \u201cbuilding-block\u201d will shed light on the framework of policies \n\ndesigned and implemented by the UAE Federal Government that led to the \n\nEmirates economic development. In this regard, a set of economic policies will \n\nbe presented. Within this set of policies, economic diversification plays a major \n\nrole as it has been guiding the country\u2019s economic development ever since its \n\nfoundation. For this matter, a theoretical discussion of economic diversification \n\nwill be presented and will also lay the framework of analysis to understand the \n\nstructural changes the UAE economy has suffered. Following this analysis, a set \n\nof general economic policies adopted by the UAE government will also be \n\npresented and they too, contributed deeply to the economic success. In a final \n\nmoment, Dubai will be showcased as a model to follow in terms of economic \n\npolicies that promote diversification and long-term sustainable growth avoiding \n\nthe risks of hydrocarbons dependence that characterized the UAE and its \n\nneighboring countries.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2. The Case Study \n\n2.1. Methodology \n\n \n\nAccording to Yin (1994), when doing social science research an Investigator has \n\na varied range of research strategies at his disposal. Experiments, surveys, \n\nhistories or even case studies are all part of this range of strategies. However, the \n\ntype of research question will determine the research strategy to be followed. As \n\nYin (2004) mentions, \u00ab\u2026case studies are the preferred strategy when \u201chow\u201d or \n\n\u201cwhy\u201d questions are being posed\u2026\u00bb or even \u00ab\u2026when the focus is on a \n\ncontemporary phenomenon within some real-life context.\u00bb. Additionally, in the \n\nwords of Fidel (1992): \u00abThe primordial goal of the Case Study is to understand \n\nthe event being studied and at the same time develop more generic theories in \n\nrespect to the observed phenomenon.\u00bb. \n\n \n\nFollowing Yin\u2019s rationale (2004), the case study method becomes feasible when \n\nthe research being conducted addresses a descriptive question (What happened?) \n\nor an explanatory question (How or Why did something happen?) as well as \n\nwhen \u00ab\u2026the need or want to get a close understanding of a particular situation.\u00bb \n\narises. Going further into the understanding of the case study method, one \n\nobserver noted that \u00ab\u2026the essence of a case study, the central tendency among \n\nall types of case study, is that it tries to illuminate a decision or set of decisions: \n\nwhy they were taken, how they were implemented, and with what results.\u00bb \n\n\n\n 21 \n\n(Schramm, 1971, apud Yin, 2004). By taking into account the above mentioned \n\narguments, the case study method arises as the most suitable strategy to address \n\nthe research question at hand - \u201cWhat were the policies adopted by the United \n\nArab Emirates Federal Government that made the Emirates economy a case of \n\nsuccess?\u201d  \n\n \n\nAddressing the present research question implies the need to understand both \n\n\u201cWhy is this a case of success?\u201d and \u201cwhat were the set of policies that led to such \n\neconomic success?\u201d. For this purpose, it becomes mandatory to comprehend and \n\ndelve deeper into the understanding of the country\u2019s economy and the set of \n\ndecisions taken by local authorities that led to the current success. In the words \n\nof Yin (2004), it becomes necessary to get a close understanding of a particular \n\nsituation. Furthermore, it is also necessary to understand why these set of \n\ndecisions were taken, how they were implemented, and what where their results. \n\nUltimately, the present research question demands the strength of the case study \n\nmethod suggested by Yin (2004), which is \u00ab\u2026its ability to examine, in depth, a \n\n\u201ccase\u201d within its \u201creal-life\u201d context.\u00bb. \n\n \n\nDelving deeper into the case study methodology, Yin (2004) states that there are \n\ntwo types of case study designs: single-case studies and multiple-case studies. \n\nThe single-case study design focuses the analysis on one unique case, allowing \n\nthe investigator to focus and devote careful attention to that case alone. On the \n\nother hand, the multiple-case study design allows the analysis of various cases \n\nwhich, according to Yin (2004), may strengthen the findings of the study. Having \n\nthe goal to analyze and understand what motivated the success through local \n\npolicies of the UAE economy, the need to focus on one unique case became \n\nmandatory. For this purpose, the present work adopts the single-case study \n\nmethodology as its research strategy. \n\n\n\n 22 \n\n \n\nHaving the case study methodology rationale as a starting point, the techniques \n\nused for data collection and data analysis in the present work were the following: \n\n \n\n? Direct observation. \n\n? Documental analysis, such as reports, research works and scientific \n\narticles/papers. \n\n? Quantitative and statistical data analysis published by Government \n\nAuthorities, International Agencies and Organizations. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 23 \n\n2.2. The United Arab Emirates \u2013 A Case of Economic \n\nSuccess \n\n \n\n2.2.1 From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates \u2013 The Economic \n\npast of the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s \n\n \n\nMore than 44 years ago, on 2 December 1971 \u00abThe United Arab Emirates \n\nachieved formal Independence as a federal state\u2026\u00bb (Al Abed, 2001). This date \n\nsignaled both the end of the treaty relationship of the former Trucial States with \n\nGreat Britain as well as the beginning of a new era of cooperation, political \n\nstability and unprecedented economic prosperity between the seven emirates \n\nthat established the federation to be known as the United Arab Emirates (UAE).  \n\n \n\nAlthough Ra\u2019s al-Khaimah would be the last to join the federation in February \n\n1972, Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Ra\u2019s al-Khaimah, Sharjah and Umm \n\nal-Quwain, they all recognized that due to their various deficiencies and the \n\ndeparture of the British Empire, cooperation among them, and thus, the \n\nestablishment of the federation, would be of paramount importance to face \n\npresent and future challenges (Peck, 2001). \n\n \n\nBefore the rise of the United Arab Emirates in 1971, the seven emirates were \n\nknown to the World as the Trucial States (or Trucial Oman). The Trucial States \n\nwere a grouping of distinct Sheikhdoms (or emirates), each one having a distinct \n\nrecognized ruler, different needs and aspirations. Furthermore, they managed \n\ntheir internal affairs independently from each other and had control over their \n\ndomestic and commercial activities. For this reason, the Trucial States were never \n\n\n\n 24 \n\na single entity with one unique and recognized ruler. However, since 1892 until \n\n1971, Great Britain had full control over each Sheikhdom\u2019s foreign affairs (BBC, \n\n2015). \n\n \n\nThe formalization of several of Great Britain\u2019s agreements with Sheikhs and \n\nrulers of the Gulf region made since 1820, culminated in a final agreement made \n\nin 1892 to protect British interests and hegemony in the Gulf region from foreign \n\nthreat (Heard-Bey, 2001).For the emirates themselves, this meant that they were \n\nunder Great Britain\u2019s protection and the British Government had to defend them \n\nfrom any external aggressions. In turn, the Sheikhdoms conceded to Great Britain \n\nexclusive rights in the states. Politically, the seven emirates composing the \n\nTrucial States were locally independent but regionally and globally dependent. \n\nThe rulers and Sheikhs of these emirates could still decide local policies and take \n\nlocal actions, but only in regards to their own Sheikhdom\u2019s interest. \n\n \n\nIt was only during the 1950\u2019s with the creation of the Trucial States Council \u2013 led \n\nby the British Government - that political and economic cooperation between the \n\nemirates was truly emphasized. It was also during this time that \u00ab\u2026commercial \n\nquantities of oil were first discovered in Abu Dhabi emirate in 1958 and oil \n\nexports commenced in 1962...\u00bb (Ghanem, 2001). \u00abOil was subsequently found in \n\nDubai and exports began in 1969.\u00bb (Ghanem, 2001). The 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s were \n\npolitically relevant to the emirates, but they were economically vital for the \n\ndecades to come. As Al Sadik (2001) mentions:  \n\n \n\n\u00abThe UAE economy has witnessed several phases of growth and development. Up to the end \n\nof the 1950\u2019s, the economy was characterized by limited natural and human resources. \n\nEconomic activities were centered mainly on agriculture (date cultivation, locally consumed \n\nvegetables and fruits), fishing, the raising of livestock, mostly camels, traditional \n\nmanufacturing (tents, rugs and carpets, gowns, daggers and swords and some dried foods) \n\n\n\n 25 \n\nand pearling. The UAE population is estimated to have been 72,000 and 86,000 inhabitants in \n\n1950 and 1958 respectively.\u00bb \n\n \n\nWith a population of 86,000 inhabitants in 1958 and a tribal culture economically \n\nstill very reliant on agriculture, fishing and pearling, the Trucial States could only \n\nhope to make good use of their scant \u2018natural wealth\u2019 to sustain its inhabitants \n\n(Heard-Bey, 2001).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n             Figure 1. Aerial view of the Abu Dhabi ruler's palace (1962) \n\n             Source: Heard-Bey, 2001 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 26 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe discovery of oil in the 1950\u2019s would put an end to the idea of scant \u201cnatural \n\nwealth\u201d.  As Shihab (2001) suggests, \u00ab\u2026improvement in agricultural \n\nproductivity is normally a necessary condition for successful development\u2026\u00bb. \n\nHowever, \u00ab\u2026there are exceptions when a developing country (particularly richly \n\nendowed with minerals) produces what he terms \u201cfood substitutes\u201d \u2013 mineral or \n\nforest products, which can be exported to world markets\u2026\u00bb (Ghareeb &amp; Al Abed, \n\n1997). The ability to export oil (mineral products) would allow the Trucial States \n\nto compensate for the low agriculture productivity of the region and initiate the \n\ndevelopment of the undeveloped desert. \n\n \n\nGreat Britain\u2019s support in establishing the Trucial States Council and in \n\ndiscovering oil in the region allowed the rulers of the seven Sheikhdoms to start \n\nplanning the development of the Emirates. As Heard-Bey (2001) argues:   \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Open market in Deira (Dubai) during \n\nthe late 1960's \n\nSource: Mcqueeney, 2012 \n\n\n\n 27 \n\n\u00abThe rulers of the seven Trucial States were brought together in the \u201cTrucial States Council\u201d, \n\nwhich met regularly and decided upon the priorities for the \u201cTrucial States Development \n\nOffice\u201d. Modest beginnings in health care, road building, agricultural extension work, \n\nvocational training, statistics and surveys of water and soil resources were made in the 1950\u2019s. \n\nSuch efforts accelerated and brought visible results in the 1960\u2019s, when Abu Dhabi began to \n\npay the lion\u2019s share for these development projects. This leading role taken by Abu Dhabi \n\nalready pointed the way forward to the foundation of the Federation of the United Arab \n\nEmirates in 1971, an independent state which benefited from the oil wealth of its member \n\nstates.\u00bb  \n\n \n\nSince 1966, when His Highness (H.H.) Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan \n\nbecame ruler of Abu Dhabi, the emirate started to serve as a catalyst of the socio-\n\neconomic development by utilizing its oil revenues to support the development \n\nof the poorer emirates. (Al Abed, 2001) Furthermore, \u00abUnder Sheikh Zayed, the \n\nsteady oil revenues resulted in an infrastructure overhaul with the construction \n\nof schools, housing, hospitals and roads throughout Abu Dhabi\u00bb (Embassy, \n\n2015). By this time, Abu Dhabi also became the single largest contributor to the \n\nTrucial States Development Fund (Al Abed, 2001). According to Von Bismarck \n\n(2013), \u00abThis was to be a central bank account, administered and controlled by \n\nthe Trucial States Development Office, through which all development aid to the \n\nTrucial States (beginning with Britain\u2019s annual contributions) would be \n\nchanneled.\u00bb. \n\n \n\nAs previously mentioned, it was only from the 1950\u2019s onwards that the \n\ndevelopment of the Trucial States began. In the words of Hawley (1970) \u00abTrucial \n\nStates development, however, started late. Until the late 1940\u2019s none of the states \n\nhad sufficient resources, and nothing was forthcoming from elsewhere.\u00bb The \n\ndiscovery of oil in Abu Dhabi and the establishment of the Trucial States \n\nDevelopment Fund during the 1950\u2019s would provide the seven emirates with the \n\nresources to begin their socio-economic development.  \n\n\n\n 28 \n\nThe funds which constituted the Development Fund came from different sources, \n\nhowever, Great Britain and Abu Dhabi where the largest contributors by late \n\n1960\u2019s (Hawley, 1970).  \n\n \n\n\u00abKuwait made generous provision, particularly in the educational and medical sphere. Qatar \n\nand Bahrain also made donations towards education and other specific projects. Saudi Arabia \n\nprovided funds for roads and education; and the United Nations Agencies also played a part. \n\nFrom 1965 onwards the Trucial States Council administered their own budget and \n\nDevelopment Fund, to which several governments made contributions.\u00bb. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3. The Clock tower roundabout (built in 1964) in Deira (Dubai) surrounded by \n\nundeveloped areas \n\nSource: Mcqueeny, 2012 \n\n \n\nThe Development Fund played a major role in boosting the social and economic \n\ndevelopment of the Trucial States. Its early beginning was even considered by \n\nthe British Government a \u201cscheme of success\u201d (Hawley, 1970). It was not only \n\nGreat Britain who viewed the establishment of the Development Fund as a \n\n\n\n 29 \n\nsuccess. H.H. Sheikh Zayed and the other six emirs understood the potential of \n\nthe development funds for future economic development.  \n\n \n\nDuring the 1960\u2019s, as Heard-Bey (2001) suggested, results from the discovery of \n\noil and efforts made towards the Development Fund started to become visible.  \n\nBy the year of 1968, according to Hawley (1970): \n\n \n\n\u00abA census was carried out with funds provided by the ruler of Abu Dhabi in 1968, and this \n\nshowed a total Trucial States population of 180,000; Dubai having a population of 59,000 and \n\nAbu Dhabi of 46,500. 13,541 people out of a total working population of 78,071 were found to \n\nbe engaged in agriculture and fishing; 3,029 in manufacturing, mining and quarries; 19,874 in \n\nconstruction; 3,062 in the oil industry; 8,028 in wholesale/retail business; 730 in banks; 8,534 \n\nin transport and communications; 12,683 in government services; and 8,590 in other \n\noccupations.\u00bb \n\n \n\nIn just over ten years, the Trucial States population increase from 86,000 to \n\n180,000, its economy was starting to change and its society was becoming more \n\ndeveloped with access to health infrastructures and new education opportunities \n\n(Hawley, 1970). However, the Trucial States still faced a scenario of poverty and \n\nhad many deficiencies (Al Abed, 2001). Furthermore, it was also at the beginning \n\nof 1968 that the British Government \u00ab\u2026announced their intention of \n\nwithdrawing from the Arabian Gulf by the end of 1971\u00bb (Embassy, 2015). \n\n \n\nWith the sudden announcement by Great Britain of its departure in 1971, the \n\nrulers of the Trucial States \u00ab\u2026were faced for the first time with the prospect of \n\ndetermining and securing their own destinies.\u00bb (Peck, 2001). In the words of Peck \n\n(2001), \u00ab\u2026there had been little preparation for Independence and its challenges.\u00bb \n\nand \u00ab\u2026virtually the whole governing structure of the new federal state had to be \n\ndevised and constructed in a short time with few relevant precedents and \n\n\n\n 30 \n\ntraditions to draw upon.\u00bb. To make matters worse, the Trucial states and its \n\nrulers recognized their individual challenges, understanding they could not \n\nsurvive alone. As both Al Abed (2001) and Peck (2001) suggest: \n\n \n\n\u00abThe decision to establish the federation followed the gradual evolving of a consensus that \n\ntheir small population, their small size, (only Abu Dhabi being larger than 1500 square miles), \n\nand their poverty (only Abu Dhabi and Dubai being oil producers) did not permit the emirates \n\nindependently, or in smaller groupings, to establish a viable, independent, political and \n\nconstitutional entity. This is not to mention those objective factors, whether cultural, religious \n\nand social, which the various emirates hold in common.\u00bb (Al Abed, 2001) \n\n \n\nOn a complementary view, Peck (2001) also suggests that the creation of the \n\nFederation was also accelerated by acknowledgment of the seven rulers that their \n\nemirates presented several deficiencies, and thus, they could not survive alone. \n\nDubai had considerable wealth from its mercantile activities and oil resources. \n\nHowever, not even its efficient state administration could compensate for their \n\nsmall territory. On the other hand, Abu Dhabi possessed over 80% of the territory \n\nand dominated hydrocarbon resources. Nonetheless, it was only starting to \n\nestablish its own administrative structure. The remaining emirates, Ajman, \n\nFujairah, Ras al-Khaimah and Umm al-Qaiwain, has very small populations and \n\nlacked both natural resources and wealth (Peck, 2001).  \n\n \n\nBeing the wealthiest emirate of the seven with the largest territorial area, Abu \n\nDhabi, under the leadership of H.H. Sheikh Zayed soon realized the paramount \n\nimportance of the Federation. In fact, for Abu Dhabi, the Federation could bring \n\nmore security and political stability both locally \u2013 due to territorial disputes \u2013 and \n\nregionally. This was also relevant to the other six emirates, including Dubai \n\nwhich also enjoyed wealth from oil revenues. However, the other five emirates \n\n\n\n 31 \n\nneeded both the security and the wealth that Abu Dhabi and Dubai enjoyed if \n\nsocio-economic development was to be achieved. \n\n \n\nAbu Dhabi\u2019s Sheikh Zayed soon assumed a leading role in establishing closer ties \n\nwith the emirates, calling for a Federation that would include the Trucial States \n\n\u2013 composed by the seven emirates \u2013 as well as Qatar and Bahrain. However, due \n\nto divergent visions, the possibility of a union with Qatar and Bahrain soon \n\ncrumbled (BBC, 2015). Sheikh Zayed was able to maintain the Trucial States \n\nunified in their creation of a Federation with the pledge \u00ab\u2026that his emirate\u2019s oil \n\nresources would be used for the benefit of all of the federation\u2019s members. \u201cAbu \n\nDhabi\u2019s oil and all its resources and potential are at the service of all the \n\nEmirates\u201d\u00bb (Heard-Bey, 2001).  \n\n \n\nAccording to Peck (2001), the generosity of Sheikh Zayed coupled with his \n\nleading role in forming the new Federation and his vision to \u00ab\u2026take full \n\nadvantage of the extraordinary new source of wealth to promote the \n\ndevelopment of both Abu Dhabi and the poorer Trucial States. \u00bb turned him into \n\nthe most probable figure to lead the Federation that was about to emerge. On 2 \n\nDecember 1971 the seven Trucial States would merge to form the United Arab \n\nEmirates, a country whose economy was now reliant on hydrocarbon resources \n\nand was still making its transitioning out of subsistence activities. As Al Abed \n\nand Hellyer (2001) suggest \u00ab\u2026the process of modern development had still to \n\nget properly under way. Many observers felt, indeed, that the new state [UAE] \n\nhad little chance of surviving as a viable entity.\u00bb. Nonetheless, the UAE would \n\nsoon rise to achieve astonishing economic endeavors.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 32 \n\n2.2.2. Major Economic Features \n\n \n\nAccording to Shihab (2001), the economic development progress of \u00abThe UAE \n\ndid not pass through the hypothetical development \u201cstages\u201d that most developed \n\ncountries seem to have experienced.\u00bb. As suggested by Al Sadik (2001), Beblawi \n\n(2011), Ghanem (2001), Omaira (2001), and Shihab (2001),  the massive oil \n\nrevenues allowed the Emirates economy to take a leap in the various \u201cstages\u201d and \n\n\u00ab\u2026have enabled the UAE to short-cut the usually difficult and lengthy process \n\nof saving and capital accumulation necessary for economic development.\u00bb \n\n(Shihab, 2001).   \n\n \n\nUnquestionably, the fast paced economic development the UAE achieved would \n\nnot be possible without its hydrocarbon resources. Due to this fact \u00ab\u2026the UAE \n\nhas embraced resource-based industries (RBI) as a development strategy, an \n\nindustrial strategy that is based on utilization of natural resources.\u00bb (Shihab, \n\n2001). With the boom in oil prices between 1973 and 1984 the UAE\u2019s public \n\nrevenues increased substantially, allowing the government to have the necessary \n\ncapital to finance several public projects, most importantly, infrastructure \n\nprojects. \n\n \n\nBy taking into account Rostow\u2019s (1990) five stages of economic growth and \n\ndevelopment we are able to understand the hypothetical development \u201cstages\u201d \n\nmentioned by Shihab (2001). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 33 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHistory allow us to verify that the UAE economy took a leap in Rostow\u2019s (1990) \n\ndevelopment \u201cstages\u201d as suggested by Shihab (2001). In 1971 the UAE was still \n\none of the least developed countries in the world with little prospects of survival \n\nas a Federation (Shihab, 2001). It was still a traditional society. Nonetheless, as \n\nAbed and Hellyer (2001) also suggest, \u00ab\u2026the accessibility to revenues from the \n\noil and gas industry has permitted the UAE to compress decades of economic \n\ngrowth into a relatively short period.\u00bb. In thirty years, the UAE was able to move \n\nfrom a traditional society (stage 1) to a society of high mass-consumption (stage \n\n5). As accurately depicted by Abed and Hellyer (2001): \n\n \n\n\u00abYet, 30 years later, the United Arab Emirates is the longest surviving successful experiment \n\nin federation anywhere in the Arab world, and has matured to become a country which not \n\nonly offers its population a modern lifestyle but also is widely recognized as having a \n\nsignificant role to play within the global community of nations.\u00bb \n\nFigure 4. Rostow's (1990) five stages of economic development \n\nSource: Rai, 2013  \n\n\n\n 34 \n\nDelving deeper into the argument of Abed and Hellyer (2001) it is possible to \n\nrelate it to Rostow\u2019s (1990) description of a society of high mass-consumption: \n\n \n\n\u00abThe third possible direction opened up by the achievement of maturity was the expansion of \n\nconsumption levels beyond basic food, shelter, and clothing, not only to better food, shelter, \n\nand clothing but into the range of mass consumption of durable consumers\u2019 goods and \n\nservices\u2026\u00bb  \n\n \n\nFurthermore, Rostow (1990) also advances the idea that a society of high mass-\n\nconsumption increases its interests in the \u00ab\u2026national pursuit of external power \n\nand influence\u2026\u00bb. An idea also shared by Abed and Hellyer (2001) when \n\nmentioning the significant role played by the UAE within the global community \n\nof nations. \n\n \n\nUndoubtedly, hydrocarbon revenues allowed the UAE to fasten the process of \n\nincreasing national savings and capital accumulation needed to foster economic \n\ndevelopment. As Pinto (2014) suggests \u00ab\u2026most countries catch up by growing \n\nthe old-fashioned way, by increasing national savings and investment, and by \n\nincreasing exports.\u00bb. The UAE was able to do this, but in an impressive short \n\nperiod of time. The sudden rise in oil production and export activities during the \n\n1970\u2019s and early 1980\u2019s coupled with the boom in oil prices during this decade, \n\nallowed the country to have the necessary capital to invest in the development of \n\nthe economy. As Kj\u00f6llerstr\u00f6m and Dallto (2007) argue: \n\n \n\n\u00ab\u2026while in many countries the discovery of natural resources has led to conflicts, and/or very \n\nlittle of the significant rents have been used to invest in people or infrastructure, elsewhere \n\nthe same discovery has been a \u201cblessing\u201d rather than a curse, as economies have flourished \n\nbuilding on the income generated by natural resource exports.\u00bb. \n\n \n\n\n\n 35 \n\n0,00%\n\n10,00%\n\n20,00%\n\n30,00%\n\n40,00%\n\n50,00%\n\n60,00%\n\n70,00%\n\n80,00%\n\n2000 2003 2006 2009 2012 2015\n\nOil Export revenues to Total Export revenues\n\n2000 - 2015\n\n0,00%\n\n10,00%\n\n20,00%\n\n30,00%\n\n40,00%\n\n50,00%\n\n60,00%\n\n70,00%\n\nOil Sector contribution to GDP\n\n1975 - 2014\n\nOil Sector\n\nThe duality presented by Kj\u00f6llerstr\u00f6m and Dallto (2007) leads us to the \n\nunderstanding of resource-based economies, one of the five main features of the \n\nUAE\u2019s economy (Omaira, 2001). According to Ahrend (2006) \u00abResource-based \n\neconomies are often defined as economies where natural resources account for \n\nmore than 10 per cent of GDP and 40 per cent of exports [revenues].\u00bb.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Figure 5. UAE Oil Sector contribution to GDP - 1975 to 2014 \n\n  Source: UAE National Bureau of Statistics, 2016 \n\nFigure 6. UAE Oil Export revenues contribution to Total Export revenues - 2000 \n\nto 2015 \n\nSource: Central Bank UAE, 2015 \n\n\n\n 36 \n\nAs illustrated in figures 5 and 6, from 2000 to 2014 the UAE has been a resourced-\n\nbased economy, where the oil sector\u2019s contribution share to GDP was always \n\nhigher than 10% and oil export revenues were always higher than 40%. However, \n\nthere is no official statistical data to demonstrate that from 1971 to 1999 oil export \n\nrevenues were always higher than 40%. Nonetheless, as shall be subject of \n\nanalysis later on the present work, from 1972 to 1999 oil revenues averaged \n\n85,46% of total government revenues. This could possibly indicate that oil export \n\nrevenues were also predominant, thus the UAE had a resource-based economy. \n\nIn addition, there is also qualitative data to support the aforementioned \n\nargument as previously suggested by Al Sadik (2001), Beblawi (2011), Ghanem \n\n(2001), Omaira (2001), and Shihab (2001). \n\n \n\nIn 2015 oil export revenues decreased significantly due to the fall of oil prices in \n\ninternational markets, thus making its contribution share drop below 40%. As \n\nAhrend (2006) suggests, \u00ab\u2026commodity prices are often particularly volatile, a \n\nsituation in which export revenues depend significantly on commodity price \n\ndevelopments implies that resource-based economies are particularly vulnerable \n\nto external shocks.\u00bb.  The vulnerability to external shocks is not the only \n\nunderlying risk.  \n\n \n\nAhrend (2006) also notes that resource-based economies tend to lag behind other \n\neconomies in terms of technological advancement. This is usually associated with \n\nthe rationale that natural resource exploration is a low-tech activity. However, \n\nthe UAE has been able to contradict this rationale by developing upstream and \n\ndownstream activities within the oil sector. In addition, off-shore and on-shore \n\nexploration of crude oil and natural gas in the UAE enjoys of the latest high-tech \n\ndevelopments within the Industry (Taylor-Evans &amp; Coyne, 2013). \n\n\n\n 37 \n\nAccording to Ahrend (2006) \u00ab\u2026resource-based development can also become a \n\ndriver of modernization.\u00bb. By developing resource sectors and directing those \n\nsectors towards the increase of exports can be a strong driver for economic \n\ngrowth as it can contribute to increasing national incomes. In addition, increasing \n\nnational incomes can lead to the growth of the non-oil sector, namely the service \n\nsector (Ahrend, 2006). Ahrend\u2019s (2006) rational clearly depicts the case of the \n\nUAE, as the country has always strived to accompany the latest high-tech \n\ndevelopments in the oil and gas industry and then directed its revenues to \n\nfinance public projects that have led to the growth of the service sector. \n\n \n\nReliance on hydrocarbon resources has been one of the major economic features \n\nsince the establishment of the Federation in 1971. As Omaira (2001) suggests, the \n\nUAE\u2019s economy is characterized by five major features, having one of them \u2013 \n\nreliance on oil and gas \u2013 been already explored. In this sense, (1) adoption of free \n\nmarket system, (2) narrowness of the domestic market, (3) reliance on foreign \n\nlabor force, and (4) geographical location constitute the remaining major \n\neconomic features of the UAE (Omaira, 2001). \n\n \n\nAccording to Omaira (2001), by adopting a free-economy with a market-based \n\nsystem, the UAE followed a different path than most developing economies. In \n\ngeneral, a free-market economy presupposes that demand and supply determine \n\neconomic factors such as prices and investment throughout the various sectors \n\nthat compose the country\u2019s economy as well as foreign and domestic trade. In \n\naddition, it also presupposes that the country\u2019s government does not have a \n\nsignificant intervention in the functioning of the economy and, thus, regulation \n\nis as limited as possible. As it shall be presented later in the present study, the \n\nUAE has adopted an open economic policy through which has promoted \n\n\n\n 38 \n\n0,00\n\n2,00\n\n4,00\n\n6,00\n\n8,00\n\n10,00\n\n12,00\n\n1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015\n\nUAE Population (millions of people) \n\n1980 - 2015\n\nfreedom of investment and trade supported by fiscal and monetary policies that \n\nfavor foreign trade and investment.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAs shown in figure 7, the UAE population (including foreigners) increased \n\nconsiderably during the period of 2000 to 2015. As Omaira (2001) pointed out in \n\n2001, the UAE was characterized by a small domestic market with a population \n\nof nearly 3 million people. As such, the UAE needed to expand its market scope \n\nand local demand by increasing exports to foreign markets. Relying on such a \n\nnarrow market would limit the expansion of production and service projects \n\n(Omaira, 2001).  \n\n \n\nThrough its economic policies \u2013 trade, investment, fiscal and monetary - the UAE \n\nGovernment was able to attract more foreign investment and enlarge the scope \n\nof foreign markets, increasing its trade activities and local demand. In turn, this \n\nled to an increasing influx of skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled foreign workers. \n\nAs such, total population increased to 9,6 million people  in 2015 leading to a \n\nFigure 7. UAE Population (in millions of people) - 1980 to 2015 \n\nSource: IMF, 2016 \n\n\n\n 39 \n\nconsequent increase of the domestic market. Nonetheless, the UAE economy still \n\nrelies on foreign trade to increase its local demand and promote further economic \n\ngrowth. \n\n \n\nDue to the shortage of national labor force, the UAE economy has been \n\ncharacterized by its high dependence on foreign labor force. Incoming labor \n\nallowed the Emirates to carry out development projects, both in the oil and non-\n\noil sectors as well as in the public and private sectors, that otherwise would not \n\nbe possible to achieve. In fact, this has always been an issue to the UAE dating \n\nback to the 1950\u2019s with the initial discoveries of oil that where only possible by \n\nbringing British expertise to lead the hydrocarbon exploration (Butt, 2001). Most \n\nrecently Free Zones and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) have brought the \n\ntechnology and know-how the Emirates did not possess.  In this sense, foreign \n\nlabor \u00ab\u2026contributed effectively to the rapid economic, social and cultural \n\ndevelopment of the country and to the creation of a market to activate the various \n\nsectors of the national economy.\u00bb (Omaira, 2001).  \n\n \n\nLastly, the UAE\u2019s geostrategic location has enabled the country to transform itself \n\ninto a regional business-hub and a transshipment platform (National Media \n\nCouncil, 2001). This has allowed the Emirates to establish several trade \n\nagreements with Arab, Gulf, Asian and Western countries (mainly Europe). Due \n\nto its geographical position, the UAE is close to suppliers of raw materials and \n\nless costly productive industries, such as India and China. But it is equally close \n\nto markets such as Europe, to where it can supply finished goods. As Omaira \n\n(2001) points out, this enables the UAE to cater for these markets much more \n\nrapidly and at a much lower cost, which in turn enhances the growth of export \n\nactivities. \n\n \n\n\n\n 40 \n\n2.2.3. Economic Performance Overview \n\n \n\nTo understand why the UAE has been remarked as a case of success \u00ab\u2026 an \n\nanalysis should be made of the development of the Gross Domestic Product \n\n(GDP)...\u00bb, which will provide us an overall picture of the UAE\u2019s economic \n\nperformance during the period of 1972 to 2015 (Omaira, 2001). According to \n\nBondarenko (2016) the GDP is an economic indicator that represents the \u00ab\u2026total \n\nmarket value of the goods and services produced by a country\u2019s economy during \n\na specific period of time. It includes all final goods and services [\u2026] that are \n\nproduced by economic agents located in that country.\u00bb.  \n\n \n\nGDP has the ability to reflect the value added by the economic sectors that make \n\nup its economy. As such, development of the value added \u00ab\u2026is a response to \n\ndomestic and foreign demand on locally-produced goods and services.\u00bb \n\n(Omaira, 2001).  In this sense, \u00ab\u2026the more productive a nation is, the easier it is \n\nto develop sustainable growth.\u00bb (Anderson et al., 2015). For this purpose, two \n\nGDP measures could be taken into account: Nominal Gross Domestic Product \n\n(NGDP; Nominal GDP) and Real Gross Domestic Product (Real GDP).  \n\n \n\nWhile NGDP values are not adjusted for inflation, Real GDP values are. This \n\nmeans that NGDP values can change over time due to changes in the quantities \n\nof goods and services produced by a country\u2019s economy and/or changes in price \n\nlevels. Although NGDP is measured in current prices (or market prices) Real \n\nGDP is measured in constant prices, meaning that it is adjusted for differences in \n\nprice levels. As a result, Real GDP will allow us to establish comparisons between \n\ndifferent time periods and assess the UAE\u2019s economic growth. In this sense, only \n\nReal GDP measure will be taken into consideration.  \n\n\n\n 41 \n\n2.2.3.1. Real GDP Evolution: 1972 \u2013 2014 \n\n \n\nAs previously mentioned, Real GDP is measured in constant prices, as such, it is \n\nnot affected by variations in price levels. It only takes into account changes in the \n\nquantities of goods and services produced by the economy. This will provide a \n\nclearer picture of the UAE\u2019s economic growth evolution.  \n\n \n\n \n\n     Figure 8. UAE Real GDP in constant 2005 prices (billions of US dollars) - 1972 to 2014 \n\n     Source: United Nations, 2015 \n\n \n\nBy taking into account statistical data shown in figure 8, it is possible to note that \n\nthe UAE\u2019s Real GDP increased from United States Dollar (USD) 27,545 billion in \n\n1972 to USD 249,578 billion in 2014. This was in fact an amazing economic \n\ndevelopment that happened mainly from late 1990\u2019s onwards. During the period \n\nof 1980 to 2014, the lowest Real GDP value registered was in 1986 with USD \n\n79,909 billion, which was due to the drop of oil prices in the international \n\nmarkets. On the contrary, the UAE registered its highest Real GDP value ever in \n\n2014 reaching USD 249,578 billion.  \n\n \n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n1972 1978 1984 1990 1996 2002 2008 2014\n\nIn\n b\n\nillin\ns o\n\nf U\nS\n\n D\no\n\nlla\nrs\n\nUAE Real GDP (in constant prices - 2005)\n\n1972 - 2014\n\n\n\n 42 \n\n1975 1980 1990 2000 2005 2010 2014\n\n36th 36th 45th 36th 36th 36th  32nd\n\nUAE Real GDP Ranking\n\nIt was indeed in the late 1990\u2019s early 2000\u2019s that the UAE economy started a rapid \n\ndevelopment and increase in its growth. If the UAE\u2019s Real GDP recorded USD \n\n139,150 billion in 2000, the Emirates were able to almost double its Real GDP \n\nvalue in just fewer than 15 years \u2013 and amidst a global financial crisis - reaching \n\nUSD 249,578 billion in 2014 as previously mentioned. According to statistical data \n\nprovided by the United Nations (2015) regarding Real GDP values of 220 \n\neconomies, the UAE ranked 32nd in 2014.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          Table 1.

The second stage was \n\nfrom 1985 to 1999, however, it was not a period of growth but instead it was a \n\nslowdown due to the fall of oil prices and government revenues. In fact, the UAE \n\nregistered its lowest Real GDP value ever in the period of 1980 to 2014. It was \n\nindeed a period of slowdown where every sector of the economy experienced \n\nmuch lower growth (Omaira, 2001). The third stage of economic growth has been \n\nfrom 2000 to 2014, where undoubtedly the UAE registered record-breaking \n\ngrowth rates (Wam, 2014).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 43 \n\n2.2.3.2.

Real GDP growth rate\u2019s fluctuated heavily within \n\nthese economies. These are due to the fact that these are resourced-based \n\neconomies heavily reliant on hydrocarbon resources. A decrease in demand in \n\nthe international markets will be reflected in the economic growth of the country. \n\nTo note is the evolution of Qatar which increased considerably due to the \n\nconsiderable increase in natural gas production and international demand.  \n\n \n\nNonetheless, from 2010 to 2015, the UAE has presented the most stable annual \n\ngrowth rate within GCC economies and ranks 3rd in terms of average annual \n\ngrowth rate in this period.

In light of \n\nthe aforementioned, the UAE economy has been registering higher growth, \n\nespecially in the last 5 years after the global financial crises and its fast economic \n\nrecover.

Main Economic Drivers - Key Sector Overview \n\n2.2.4.1. Early Key Sectors and Economic Drivers \u2013 1971 to 1999 \n\n \n\nSince the establishment of the federation in 1971 hydrocarbon resources have \n\nbeen the main economic driver of the UAE\u2019s economy by providing the \u201cfuel for \n\ngrowth\u201d (Abed &amp; Hellyer, 2001). According to statistical data provided by the \n\nUAE National Bureau of Statistics and the UAE\u2019s central bank, the oil sector\u2019s \n\ncontribution share to GDP (in current prices) in 1975 was 57,26%, almost two-\n\nthirds of the country\u2019s GDP. In addition, oil revenues contributed to \n\napproximately 90% of total government revenues, which demonstrates the \n\nimportance of the oil sector.  \n\n \n\nThe UAE Government started by investing and developing the oil sector as \n\nhydrocarbon revenues and contribution to the overall economy were crucial. The \n\nFederal Government decided to enhance the role of the public sector in the \n\neconomic development of the country and started by investing in manufacturing \n\nassociated with oil and gas (Ghanem, 2001). In this sense, upstream and \n\ndownstream developments were undertaken.  \n\n \n\nUpstream developments in the hydrocarbon sector were related to the \n\nexploration, development and production of oil and gas. Downstream \n\ndevelopments included refining, distribution and marketing of petroleum \n\nproducts and liquefied natural gas (LNG) (Ghanem, 2001). The initial economic \n\ngrowth as well as the need to divest away from reliance on hydrocarbon \n\nresources led to the development of the non-oil sector.  \n\n \n\n\n\n 49 \n\nAccording to Ghanem (2001), development of the UAE\u2019s non-oil sector started in \n\nthe late 1960\u2019s and early 1970\u2019s with the construction boom \u2013 associated with the \n\nrapid development in infrastructure - and the expansion of the food industry in \n\nother to cope with the increase in population.  The number of industrial \n\nestablishments related to building and construction activities increased rapidly \n\n(Ghanem, 2001). The first cement factory was established in Ras al-Khaimah in \n\n1975, which would soon become an important industry of the UAE\u2019s economy. \n\nThe food industry expanded its activities in late 1960\u2019s and early 1970\u2019s and \n\nstarted functioning as an import-substitution industry 2  ever since. By 1985 \n\nthe\u00ab\u2026number of factories for food processing and beverages with a labor force \n\nof more than ten people reached 80\u2026\u00bb, while in 1996 this number had increased \n\nto 130 factories (Ghanem, 2001). \n\n \n\nOther industries also registered further developments. By mid-1980\u2019s the Textile \n\nindustry reached 150 factories employing ten or more persons. According to \n\nGhanem (2001), by mid-1990\u2019s this was considered the 2nd largest manufacturing \n\nindustry which constituted approximately 15% of the non-oil exports. By the end \n\nof 1999 the Metal products and Machinery industries were composed by 312 \n\nfactories in total that dealt with products such as metal furniture and air-\n\nconditioners. The Basic metal industries also played a major role, mainly since \n\nthe establishment of the Dubai Aluminum Company (DUBAL), which initiated \n\nits activities in 1979. By mid-1990\u2019s this would become the largest manufacturing \n\nindustry in the UAE (Ghanem, 2001). \n\n \n\nFrom the 1980\u2019s to 1990\u2019s the Banking and Insurance sector as well as the Real \n\nEstate sector started to emerge as result of the increase in population and \n\n                                                 \n2 Import Substitution Industrialization is a Trade policy that aims to reduce a country\u2019s foreign imports by \n\nreplacing them with domestic production. \n\n\n\n 50 \n\nconstruction boom. In addition, the demand for credit loans also grew as a result \n\nof the expansion of the private sector and manufacturing-related businesses. It \n\nwas also during the 1980\u2019s and early 1990\u2019s that the emirate of Dubai \u00ab\u2026took a \n\nstrategic decision to emerge as a major international-quality tourism \n\ndestination.\u00bb (Government, 2016). \u00abThis was followed by the launching of the \n\nworld-famous Burj Al Arab hotel in 1999 and the flood of hotels, resorts and \n\nentertainment facilities that have since been developed.\u00bb (Taylor-Evans &amp; Coyne, \n\n2013). Nonetheless, until the mid-1990\u2019s it was the manufacturing industry that \n\nassumed a major economic role outside the oil-sector. \n\n \n\n2.2.4.2. Main Economic Drivers \u2013 2000 to 2015 \n\n \n\nAccording to Taylor-Evans and Coyne (2013) the UAE\u2019s main economic drivers \n\nas of 2013 have been the (1) Energy Sector, (2) Industry, (3) Tourism, (4) \n\nTransports and Logistics, and (5) Real Estate and Construction.  This has been in \n\naccordance with both previous economic drivers \u2013 although Tourism is an \n\nimportant newcomer \u2013 as well as the Federal Government\u2019s policies towards \n\neconomic development. A review of the 5 main economic drivers is presented \n\nbelow. \n\n \n\nEnergy Sector  \n\n \n\nThe energy sector comprises oil-related industries, natural gas and most recently \n\nrenewable energies. According to Taylor-Evans and Coyne (2013) the UAE had \n\nin 2013 the world\u2019s 7th largest proven oil and gas reserves and as such, \u00ab\u2026the \n\nUAE\u2019s 97.8 billion barrels of proven oil reserves will offer a steady flow for \n\nanother 80 years at current production rates.\u00bb. In addition, this turned the UAE \n\n\n\n 51 \n\ninto the 5th largest producer of oil in the world, with 3,8% of global production, \n\nup from 3,2% in 2010 (Taylor-Evans &amp; Coyne, 2013). Regarding gas production, \n\nthe UAE was estimated to represent 1,6% of global gas supply in 2012. \n\nNonetheless, reserves accounted for 3,2% of the world total.  \n\n \n\nIn terms of development of the energy sector, the UAE has made efforts to \n\nmaintain both upstream and downstream development by keeping the pace with \n\nthe latest technological advancements within the industry. In addition, the UAE \n\nGovernment started to devote close attention to renewable energy and energy \n\nefficiency programs which aim at reducing the reliance on hydrocarbon \n\nresources (Taylor-Evans &amp; Coyne, 2013). Clean energy projects in the UAE such \n\nas the Shams 1 and the Masdar City Solar Photovoltaic Plant are currently the \n\ntwo largest renewable energy projects in the Middle East (Masdar, 2016). \n\n \n\nIndustry \n\n \n\nIndustrial development has always played a vital role in promoting economic \n\ndiversification and growth within the UAE. According to Ghanem (2001) \n\nindustrial development was the engine of the economy by promoting forward \n\nand backward linkages that would stimulate growth and promote \n\ndiversification. Industries such as cement manufacturing and metals kept its \n\nimportance while new ones gained momentum, such as the automotive sector. \n\nIn fact, the UAE emerged as what Taylor-Evans and Coyne (2013) coined of \n\n\u201cmetals production powerhouse\u201d in the Middle East in recent years by having \n\n46% share of total Middle East aluminum production and the largest single-site \n\nsmelting facility in the world3.  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n3 According to Taylor-Evans and Coyne (2013) DUBAL is the largest single-site smelting facility in the world. \n\n\n\n 52 \n\nBy 2012, Industry as a whole accounted for 16% of the UAE\u2019s GDP. This has been \n\npossibly mainly through the significant strides the UAE has been undertaking in \n\nadopting the latest technologies and best practices from world economies such \n\nas Germany and Japan (Taylor-Evans &amp; Coyne, 2013). Petrochemicals, metals, \n\nceramics and cement still dominate the UAE Industry sector. Nonetheless, sub-\n\nsectors such as the automotive, chemicals, electrical machinery and power \n\nequipment, and food processing are gaining momentum, which has been \n\npropelled by the influx of foreign enterprises that bring to the UAE the most up-\n\nto-date technologies and know-how (Taylor-Evans &amp; Coyne, 2013).   \n\n \n\nTourism \n\n \n\nTourism became one of the main key drivers of economic growth in the UAE \n\nsince late 1990\u2019s as the country also became one of the fastest-growing travel \n\ndestinations being ranked 31st  in the world in 2012. It was also in the year of 2012 \n\nthat tourism\u2019s contribution share to GDP reached 14% and attracted \n\napproximately Dh 82,8 billion in investments, almost 23% of the country\u2019s total \n\ninvestments (Taylor-Evans &amp; Coyne, 2013). As a result, tourism has also \n\n\u00ab\u2026benefited from, and helped spawn, a number of high-growth areas of the \n\nUAE\u2019s economy, most notably hotels, airlines and airports, and retail\u00bb(Taylor-\n\nEvans &amp; Coyne, 2013).  \n\n \n\nDubai has been the engine of tourism within the UAE registering 10,2 million \n\nvisitors in 2012, followed by Abu Dhabi with 2,3 million visitors. Abu Dhabi has \n\nmade efforts to further develop its tourism sector with mega-projects such as \n\nSaadiyat Island which will have the Louvre Abu Dhabi museum. Yas Island is a \n\nsimilar mega-project in Abu Dhabi that currently hosts the venues for the \n\nFormula 1 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix and \u00ab\u2026the Ferrari World Abu Dhabi, which is \n\n\n\n 53 \n\nthe world\u2019s largest indoor theme park and the first ever Ferrari theme park in the \n\nworld.\u00bb (Taylor-Evans &amp; Coyne, 2013). \n\n \n\nTransport and Logistics \n\n \n\nSince the early birth of the Federation, the UAE Government strived to develop \n\nthe country\u2019s transport and logistics infrastructures. With the tourism boom and \n\nthe increasing in visitors, the aviation industry started playing a major role in the \n\ncountry. It is estimated that in 2012 the aviation industry contribution share to \n\nGDP reached 15% of total GDP (Taylor-Evans &amp; Coyne, 2013). Due to the increase \n\nin air passenger numbers and freight volumes the UAE has been investing \n\nheavily in its airports and ports. In addition, the UAE is currently home to two \n\nof the ten safest airline companies in the world, Emirates Airlines, which ranks \n\n2nd and Etihad Airways, which ranks 8th (Jet Airliner Crash Data Evaluation \n\nCentre [JACDEC], 2016). \n\n \n\nIn 2012 Dubai\u2019s International Airport reached 58 million passengers and figures \n\nare estimated to increase to 98 million passengers by 2020 (Taylor-Evans &amp; \n\nCoyne, 2013). It was in light of the aforementioned, that Dubai\u2019s International \n\nAirport has been expanded and a new airport is being built in order to cope with \n\nthe increase in air passengers. The Dubai World Central Al Maktoum \n\nInternational Airport is expected to be the world\u2019s largest airport with a capacity \n\nof 160 million passengers (Taylor-Evans &amp; Coyne, 2013).4 In addition, to support \n\nTrade activities, Dubai hosts the Jebel Ali Port, which is \u00ab\u2026is the largest port in \n\nthe Middle East and the largest [port] situated between Europe and the main \n\nAsian Markets.\u00bb (Taylor-Evans &amp; Coyne, 2013). \n\n                                                 \n4 Although it is operating for cargo purposes only, Dubai World Central Airport is expected to be fully \n\ncompleted by 2025. \n\n\n\n 54 \n\nReal Estate and Construction \n\n \n\nThe construction sector continues to play an important role within the UAE \n\neconomy, while the real estate sector has grown. By 2012 it is estimated that the \n\nconstruction sector accounted for approximately 10% of total GDP and the real \n\nestate\u2019s sector contribution share to GDP was of approximately 9%. Together, real \n\nestate and construction have accounted for 19% of the UAE\u2019s total GDP (Taylor-\n\nEvans and Coyne, 2013). In addition, \u00abThe total construction market in the UAE \n\nat the end of 2012 stood at Dh 375 billion, which was almost 44% of the entire \n\nGCC market.\u00bb (Taylor-Evans &amp; Coyne, 2013). \n\n \n\nDubai and Abu Dhabi lead the way in terms of construction and real estate mega-\n\nprojects, which have contributed largely to attract foreign investment, tourism \n\nactivity and boast the country\u2019s image on a global scale. As previously \n\nmentioned, Abu Dhabi has been developing the Saadiyat Island, a mega-project \n\nwhich will host several museums such as the Louvre Abu Dhabi. In addition, \n\nseveral luxury residential complexes have been built along with five-star \n\ninternational hotels both in Saadiyat Island and Yas Island. As part of Abu \n\nDhabi\u2019s mega-projects the expansion of its airport is also underway. With an \n\nestimated value of USD 2,94 billion, Abu Dhabi\u2019s airport will feature the world\u2019s \n\nlongest indoor arch (Taylor-Evans &amp; Coyne, 2013). \n\n \n\nSince 1999 Dubai is host to the Burj Al Arab, one of the most luxurious hotels in \n\nthe world, and has the world\u2019s tallest infrastructure (building) in the world, the \n\n830 meter high Burj Khalifa. Most recently, Dubai has initiated a series of multi-\n\nbillion dollar projects, such as the Mohammed bin Rashid City, which has an \n\nestimated value of USD 65 billion (National, 2015). Other mega-projects include \n\nAkoya by Damac, a compound of 2,600 luxury villas with an estimated value of \n\n\n\n 55 \n\nUSD 6 billion and Dubai Parks and Resorts, which is a Theme Park complex \n\ncomprising attractions such as Legoland, Motiongate and Bollywood Parks with \n\nan estimated value of USD 3 billion (National, 2015). These multi-billion dollar \n\nprojects not only have been boosting the real estate and construction sector, but \n\nthey have also been contributing heavily towards other sectors such as tourism. \n\n \n\n2.2.5. The United Arab Emirates Achievements\u2013 The year of 2015 \n\nin Review \n\n \n\nThe UAE\u2019s economy of today bears little resemblance to that of late 1960\u2019s and \n\nearly 1970\u2019s, when the Federation was established. In 1968 the former Trucial \n\nStates \u2013 which today form the UAE \u2013 had a population of no more than 180,000 \n\ninhabitants, being the emirate of Dubai the most populated with 59,000 \n\ninhabitants followed by Abu Dhabi with 46,500 inhabitants (Hawley, 1970). \n\nInfrastructures were almost non-existent as Butt (2001) suggests, in the 1960\u2019s \n\n\u00ab\u2026there were no roads or basic amenities.\u00bb in the country.  \n\n \n\n\n\n 56 \n\n \n\n     Figure 14. Aerial view of Abu Dhabi during the early 1960's \n\n     Source: Langton, 2013 \n\n \n\nThe UAE economy was witnessing the very modest beginnings of a transitioning \n\nphase propelled by the discovery of oil. Nonetheless, the country was still heavily \n\nmarked by its subsistence economy which was characterized by subsistence \n\nagriculture, pearling extraction, fishing and trading.  The UAE still faced poverty \n\nand presented several deficiencies within its seven emirates (Al Abed, 2001). It \n\nwas in light of such a scenario that during the 1960\u2019s the former Trucial States \n\nreceived financial support from Great Britain, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and Saudi \n\nArabia in order to begin its socio-economic development (Hawley, 1970). On the \n\noutskirts of its establishment as a Federation in 1971, the UAE had indeed little \n\nprospects of survival as a viable State (Al Abed &amp; Hellyer, 2001). If the Emirates \n\nfaced the risk of not being a viable nation, how could they be a viable economy? \n\n \n\nMore than 40 years later, by undergoing an impressive economic transformation, \n\nthe UAE achieved \u00ab\u2026record-breaking rates of growth in all fields, which has \n\nplaced it at the top in terms of global competitiveness.\u00bb (Wam, 2014). \n\n\n\n 57 \n\nFurthermore, the UAE has earned the status of one of the most developed \n\ncountries in the world, with sustainable growth in the several sectors and fields \n\nthat constitute its economy, such as trade, investment, tourism, infrastructure \n\nand human and social development (Wam, 2014). As Anderson et al. (2015) \n\nsuggest \u00ab\u2026the UAE is today a politically stable country that has achieved high-\n\nincome status and plays an active role shaping regional and global affairs\u00bb. \n\n \n\nAs of 2015 the UAE presents the following characteristics: \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 2.

It is also important to note the 25th world position in \n\nterms of FDI inflow, 20th position as the world\u2019s biggest exporter as well as the \n\n31st place in terms of easiness in doing business. These global-level economic \n\nsuccesses have been the result of prudent and wise policymaking adopted by the \n\nUAE Government, which transformed the country from a factor-driven economy \n\ninto an innovation-driven economy in just over 40 years (WEF, 2015a).6 \n\n \n\nThrough the WEF\u2019s \u2018Global Competitiveness Report\u2019 of 2015-16 it is possible to \n\nhave a more detailed global-scale perspective of the UAE\u2019s economic success. \n\nThis additional view is depicted below: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n5 The \u201cGlobal Competitiveness Report\u201d has been issued annually by the World Economic Forum since 2004 \n\nand provides an analysis of the various drivers that enable an economy to achieve long-term sustainable \n\ngrowth and prosperity. The rationale is that the more competitive economies usually produce higher levels \n\nof income, have higher growth potential and thus, are more capable of achieving higher economic prosperity \n\nand development. \n6 Factor-driven economies \u2013 competition between countries is made primarily by using unskilled labor force \n\nand natural resources; Efficiency-driven economies \u2013 countries achieve growth by developing production \n\nprocesses to improve product quality; Innovation-driven economies \u2013 competition between economies is \n\nmade by using the most advanced processes to produce new and different products and services (WEF, \n\n2015a). \n\n\n\n 60 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 16.

Interestingly, the UK was \n\none of the largest providers of financial aid to the former Trucial States \n\nDevelopment Fund in the 1960\u2019s, which aimed at supporting the development of \n\nthe seven emirates that today form the UAE. By surpassing countries such as the \n\nUK, the UAE now rank 2nd out of 140 economies in terms \u2018Quality of overall \n\ninfrastructure and 1st in \u2018Quality of roads\u2019. The country is also ranked 1st in terms \n\nof lack inflation and 2nd in the world in terms of effectiveness of government \n\nspending (WEF, 2015a).  \n\n \n\n\n\n 62 \n\nIn fact, policy-related factors such as the lack of government bureaucracy and \n\nregulations (5th out of 140), efficiency of customs procedures (3rd out of 140) and \n\nlack of tariff barriers (2nd out of 140) have made a huge contribution to increase \n\ntrade activities and attract FDI into the country, which has brought substantial \n\nbenefits in terms of technological advancements and know-how (WEF, 2015a). In \n\nthis sense, the UAE is not only a regional business-hub (with a 5th place in terms \n\nof \u2018Control of international distribution\u2019 and 11th as the contribution of Exports \n\nto its total GDP), but it is also a technologically advanced country with a high \n\ncapacity to attract and retain specialized talent aiming to build a knowledge \n\neconomy. By looking at the most well-ranked indicators it is possible to note that \n\nthe economic success of the UAE has not been only due to abundant oil resources. \n\nPrudent and wise policy-making by the UAE Government has played an \n\nunquestionably vital role in fostering the country\u2019s economic development. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 63 \n\n2.3. Economic Policies \n\n \n\nDuring the Economic Planning Forum in October 2015, Sultan Saeed Al \n\nMansouri, UAE\u2019s Minister of Economy, clearly stated the aim of UAE\u2019s economic \n\npolicies: \n\n \n\n\u00abThe UAE economy has maintained positive growth levels despite a decline in oil prices and \n\na slow global economic performance. This has come about as a result of our resilient economic \n\npolicies that aim to increase diversification and decrease reliance on oil.\u00bb (John, 2015) \n\n \n\nAs pointed out by Omaira (2001), the pillars of economic policy for the UAE have \n\nbeen policies that favor a free market economy and diversification of income \n\nsources. It is in this sense that the UAE\u2019s main goal has been to formulate \n\neconomic policies that (1) stimulate growth; (2) allow the diversification of the \n\neconomy away from hydrocarbon resources; (3) attract investment, both foreign \n\nand local; (4) create a business-friendly environment with few or no \n\nrestrictions/barriers that support trade liberalization, (5) and create employment \n\nopportunities for all its citizens (World Trade Organization [WTO], 2006b). \n\n \n\nThroughout the years the UAE Government has promoted a progressive \n\neconomic agenda that has its general policy framework built around economic \n\ndiversification and liberalization. For this matter, to understand the economic \n\npolicies adopted by the UAE Government that stimulated its economic success, \n\nit is necessary to comprehend first the process of diversification and structural \n\nchange the UAE witnessed which, in turn, shaped its general economic policies \n\nsuch as Trade, Investment, Fiscal and Monetary. \n\n \n\n\n\n 64 \n\nThis set of general policies will also be subject of analysis. However, it is of \n\nrelevance to note that the present study and most importantly, the UAE \n\nGovernment, recognizes and emphasizes the importance of trade and investment \n\npolicies in supporting the process of economic diversification (WTO, 2006b). \n\nFurthermore, it is the \u00ab\u2026 [UAE] Federal Government [that] provides the broad \n\nframework for policymaking\u2026\u00bb, being most key decisions made at the emirate \n\nlevel (WTO, 2006b).  \n\n \n\nWithin the seven emirates economic policies differ as is the case of Dubai and \n\nAbu Dhabi. Due to its declining oil industry, Dubai has pursued a strategy of \n\ndiversification much more aggressively than Abu Dhabi. In this sense, it has been \n\ninvolved with most new initiatives, which include developing further the \n\ntourism sub-sector, media, and technology, financial and commercial services, \n\nshipping and extending the number of its free zones to attract more foreign \n\ninvestment. Meanwhile, Abu Dhabi has been investing heavily on the oil sector, \n\nboth in its upstream hydrocarbon resources and downstream industrial projects \n\nwhile continuing to finance the development of the non-oil sector through oil \n\nrevenues. In this sense, a more general approach towards UAE\u2019s economic \n\npolicies will be followed. Lastly, a model of economic diversification shall be \n\npresented based on Dubai\u2019s experience.  \n\n \n\n2.3.1. Economic Diversification - The Framework of Analysis \n\n \n\nIn general, economic diversification can be understood by the simple rationale of \n\nmaking a country\u2019s economy transition from a single or few sources of income to \n\nan economy that has multiple sources of income generated across the primary, \n\n\n\n 65 \n\nsecondary and tertiary sectors (Hvidt, 2013). However, this is a restrictive view \n\nof diversification. For instance, as Hvidt (2013) explicitly demonstrates: \n\n\u00abIn political economy, diversification normally refers to exports, and specifically to policies \n\naiming to reduce the dependence on a limited number of export commodities that may be \n\nsubject to price and volume fluctuations or secular declines.\u00bb. \n\n \n\nHvidt (2013) keeps delving deeper into this subject by suggesting that within \n\npolitical economy, diversification can take two forms: horizontal and vertical. \n\nThrough horizontal diversification, new opportunities are sought for new \n\nproducts within the same sector. Vertical diversification means adding more \n\nstages of processing of domestic or imported inputs. In other words, vertical \n\ndiversification will ultimately create the above mentioned multiple sources of \n\nincome across the three different sectors (primary, secondary and tertiary). The \n\nshift from one sector or industry to another will then encourage \u00ab\u2026forward and \n\nbackward linkages in the economy, as the output of one activity becomes the \n\ninput of another, thus upgrading the value added produced locally.\u00bb (Hvidt, \n\n2013).  \n\n \n\nAn interesting interchangeability of concepts regarding diversification and \n\nindustrialization is raised by Hvidt (2013). In fact, the argument of Shihab (2001) \n\nregarding the case of the UAE clearly exemplifies the proximity between \n\ndiversification and industrialization: \n\n \n\n\u00abIn the process of economic development, industrialization has been considered crucial to the \n\ntransition. Industrialization is linked to the idea of stimulating forward and backward \n\nlinkages with the rest of the economy. In common with other developing countries, the UAE, \n\nwhose economy has been significantly dependent on the export of one primary product, \n\nnamely oil, pursued a strategy of industrialization to diversify the sources of its national \n\nincome and reduce its dependence on oil.\u00bb  \n\n\n\n 66 \n\nThe process of industrialization can easily be associated with the idea of \n\n\u00ab\u2026accumulation of productive capacity within either the manufacturing sector \n\nand/or the service sector\u00bb which, according to Hvidt (2013) is the rationale behind \n\na process of vertical diversification. Furthermore, industrialization is not only \n\nlinked with Industry and the establishment of enterprises with productive \n\ncapabilities. Industrialization is a much broader process. It \u00ab\u2026 entails the process \n\nof creating service industries such as tourism, financial services, insurance, \n\nbanking, real estate services, transportation,\u2026\u00bb, among others (Hvidt, 2013).  \n\n \n\nThe concept of industrialization can then be used interchangeably with vertical \n\ndiversification, because both processes entail the accumulation of productive \n\ncapacity on both the manufacturing and the service sectors. This, in turn, will \n\nstimulate forward and backward linkages in the economy. The following \n\ninterpretation of Hvidt (2013) allows a more holistic understanding of the UAE\u2019s \n\neconomic diversification process. It reinforces the idea that \u00abthe aim of \n\ndiversification is spreading risk by creating a variety of income sources\u2026\u00bb, while \n\n\u00ab\u2026industrialization in its broadest understanding is the process of creating these \n\ndiverse income sources.\u00bb (Hvidt, 2013). \n\n \n\nBy having the UAE\u2019s economy as a guiding point as well as its heavy dependence \n\non hydrocarbon resources, it is possible to adjust even further the concept of \n\neconomic diversification. As Hvidt (2013) quotes, \u00abWithin the context of the GCC \n\ncountries, economic diversification means reducing heavy dependence of the oil \n\nsector by developing a non-oil economy, non-oil exports and non-oil revenue \n\nsources.\u00bb (Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia [ESCWA], 2001, \n\napud Hvdit, 2013) This vision allows the integration of the political economy \n\ninterpretation of diversification, where it includes the diversification of exports \n\nand the need for the creation and development of multiple sources of income \n\n\n\n 67 \n\nacross the manufacturing and service sectors, thus, making it possible to have a \n\nclearer picture of the UAE diversification evolution. \n\n \n\nUltimately, it is of relevance to understand that diversification can occur both \n\nwithin the oil sector as well as in the non-oil sector.  As Hvidt (2013) suggests \u00abIn \n\naddition to the extraction of oil and gas, the oil-based industries include \n\nrefineries, the vast petrochemical sector and energy-intensive industries such as \n\naluminum.\u00bb. Diversification towards these industries is easier since they rely on \n\nthe low cost and ample supply of oil and gas of the country and they might \n\nreduce the disadvantages of the capital intensive oil sector. However, they are \n\nstill heavily reliant on oil and gas, and as such, if these resources come to an end, \n\nit will not be feasible to sustain them with imported resources (Hvidt 2013). \n\n \n\nIn order to divest away from hydrocarbons, it is crucial to broaden the base of \n\nthe economy by diversifying the non-oil sector. Food processing and the \n\nmanufacture of construction materials are clear examples of industries within the \n\nnon-oil sector that should be targeted for development. In fact, the UAE economy \n\nstarted registering growth in these industries due to its rapid population growth \n\nas we shall see in the next section. These industries rely mainly on imported \n\ngoods that will be transformed for the value-added creation. Furthermore, they \n\nare not capital-intensive, they are labor-intensive and usually privately owned, \n\nwhich will contribute for the creation of jobs, broadening of the GDP contribution \n\nshare and thus, for the diversification and long-term sustainable development of \n\nthe economy (Hvidt, 2013). \n\n \n\nHaving laid the conceptual foundations for the analysis of the evolution of the \n\ndiversification process in the UAE, it is mandatory to also lay the guidelines for \n\n\n\n 68 \n\nthe measurement of this process. As such, the following measures suggested by \n\nHvidt (2013) will be taken into consideration for the upcoming analysis: \n\n \n\n1. The percentage contribution of oil versus non-oil sectors to GDP; \n\n2. The percentage contribution of GDP by economic activity; \n\n3. The percentage contribution of oil revenues as a proportion of total \ngovernment revenues; \n\n4. The percentage contribution of non-oil export to total export revenues. \n\n \n\n2.3.2. Economic Diversification Policy \u2013 The UAE evolution \n\n \n\nThe following analysis of one of the main goals of the UAE\u2019s economic policy \n\naims at depicting the evolution of the process of diversification as well as \n\nunderstanding the extent of such policy. For this matter, it will be possible to (1) \n\nprovide an indication of the structural change in the economy; (2) understand \n\nhow the non-oil sector evolved throughout the years; (3) verify if dependence on \n\noil revenues has been reduced, and (4) have an indication of diversification. \n\n2.3.2.1. Percentage contribution of oil vs. Non-oil sectors to GDP \n\n \n\nComparing the percentage contribution of the Oil Sector versus the Non-Oil \n\nSector to GDP will provide us with an indication of the structural changes that \n\noccurred both in the economy and in the society of the UAE (Hvidt, 2013). \n\nFurthermore, this will allow us to understand how the structure of the UAE\u2019s \n\nGDP changed over time, which will ultimately tell us how the productive \n\nstructure of the economy evolved throughout the years. \n\n \n\n\n\n 69 \n\n \n\nFigure 19.United Arab Emirates \u2013 Oil &amp; Non-Oil Sector contribution to GDP I \u2013 1975 to 2014 \n\nSource: UAE National Bureau of Statistics, 2016 \n\n \n\n \n\nIt was possible to collect data regarding the sectorial origin of the UAE\u2019s GDP \n\nfrom 1975 to 2014, which will provide us with a clear picture of structural changes \n\nsince the early birth of the United Arab Emirates. Figure 19 shows that in 1975 \n\nthe non-oil sector\u2019s contribution share to GDP amounted for 42,74%, reaching \n\n65,55% in 2014. In addition, the years of 1998 and 1999 reached 82,97% and \n\n79,52% of the total GDP, the highest values registered until 2014. On the other \n\nhand, 1975 was the year where the non-oil sector contributed the least to total \n\nGDP, with only 42,74%. By taking into account figure 22 it is possible to note that \n\nthere was a probable structural change in the economy and that it was slowly \n\nreducing the output of the oil sector to the GDP. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0,00%\n\n20,00%\n\n40,00%\n\n60,00%\n\n80,00%\n\n100,00%\n\n19761978198019821984198619881990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014\n\nOil &amp; Non-Oil Sector contribution to GDP I \n\n1975-2014\n\nOil Sector Non-Oil Sector\n\n\n\n 70 \n\nThe UAE economy has been increasing the non-oil sector contribution share to \n\nGDP, meaning that the process of diversification has been implemented as we \n\nshall see next by looking at each sector.  Although the oil sector7output to GDP \n\nhas been decreasing from 57,26% in 1975 to 34,35% in 2014, this does not \n\nguarantee us that the economy has reduced significantly its dependence on \n\nhydrocarbon resources. As Ghanem (2001) noted, although in 1998 the oil sector \n\ncontribution share to GDP was very low (17,21%) the economy was still heavily \n\nreliant on oil and gas.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 20. United Arab Emirates \u2013 Oil &amp; Non-Oil Sector contribution to GDP II \u2013 1975 to 2014 \n\nSource: UAE National Bureau of Statistics, 2016 \n\n \n\nFigure 20 depicts exactly this underlying scenario. Although there is an obvious \n\ninverse relation between the oil and non-oil sector contribution share, it is the oil \n\nsector that drives the high or low peaks of each sector. For instance, from 1980 to \n\n1986, there was a significant decrease of the oil sector\u2019s output to GDP. This was \n\ndue to the sudden fall of oil prices in the international markets, which lead to the \n\n                                                 \n7 The oil sector comprises Crude Oil, Natural Gas and Quarrying. The last economic activity relies heavily \n\non the consumption of hydrocarbon resources and benefits from its low prices, which means it is also subject \n\nto price fluctuations. \n\n0,00%\n\n10,00%\n\n20,00%\n\n30,00%\n\n40,00%\n\n50,00%\n\n60,00%\n\n70,00%\n\n80,00%\n\n90,00%\n\nOil &amp; Non-Oil Sector contribution to GDP II\n\n1975 - 2014\n\nOil Sector Non-Oil Sector\n\n\n\n 71 \n\ndecrease of both oil exports and revenues. As a consequence, the non-oil sector \n\nregistered an increase in its contribution share from 44,76% in 1980 to 73,26% in \n\n1986.  \n\n \n\nThe period of 1990 to 1998 was a similar time frame where both oil prices and \n\nrevenues dropped, albeit not so sharply as in the years of 1980-1986. This is \n\nbecause there was also an increase in the contribution share to GDP of several \n\nsectors, such as manufacturing, construction or financing and insurance, which \n\nsuggests that the productive structure of the economy was changing. However, \n\nthis change was not as sharp as figure 20 might suggest. The years of 2001 and \n\n2002 were also marked by a decrease in oil prices, exports and revenues. \n\nHowever, the total exports and re-exports registered an increase and there were \n\nno significant changes in the various non-oil sectors contribution shares to GDP.  \n\n \n\nThis demonstrates that the oil sector still has considerable impact in the \n\nproductive structure of the economy. Furthermore, 2009 was also an interesting \n\nyear on the outskirts of the world\u2019s financial crisis. The Nominal Gross Domestic \n\nProduct (NGDP) - at current prices \u2013 contribution of the oil sector had a sharp \n\ndecrease which caused the contribution of the non-oil sector to increase once \n\nmore. However, few were the non-oil sectors that registered an increase in its \n\nNGDP contribution despite their small but illusive increase in percentage terms.  \n\n \n\nAt this point it is possible to understand that throughout the years the oil sector \n\nalways played a major role in the structure of the GDP. Nonetheless, by taking \n\ninto consideration an overall perspective towards non-oil sectors, it is possible to \n\nnotice change and, thus some degree of diversification. In 1975 the non-oil \n\nsector\u2019s contribution share was 42,74% of GDP while in 2014 it reached 65,65% of \n\n\n\n 72 \n\nthe GDP.  In this sense, it is relevant to look at the evolution of the distribution of \n\nGDP by economic activities. \n\n \n\n2.3.2.2. Percentage contribution of GDP by economic activity \n\n  \n\n \n\nTable 8. United Arab Emirates \u2013 Distribution of GDP by economic activity (in current prices) \u2013 \n\n1975 to 2014 \n\nSource: UAE National Bureau of Statistics, 2016 \n\n \n\nTable 8 provides us an extensive overview of the evolution of the distribution of \n\nthe GDP by economic activity between 1975 and 2014. This is mainly relevant to \n\nunderstand how the non-oil sector changed over time as well as the extent of the \n\n\n\n 73 \n\nprocess of diversification.8 Furthermore, it is also worth mentioning again that \n\nthe oil sector comprises Crude Oil, Natural Gas and Quarrying. \n\n \n\nAs previously mentioned, in 1975 the oil sector still accounted for 57,26% of the \n\nGDP. This meant that non-oil economic activities had less relevance to the \n\ncountry\u2019s GDP, thus, to the growth of the economy. However, as Ghanem (2001) \n\npoints out, \u00ab\u2026development in the 1960\u2019s and 1970\u2019s, and to a lesser degree after \n\nthat, focused on physical infrastructure such as roads, ports, airports, water and \n\nelectricity supplies and on social infrastructures such as schools and hospitals. \u00bb. \n\nBy this time the UAE was indeed experiencing a booming infrastructure \n\ndevelopment. \n\n \n\nBoth the increase in the development of infrastructures and the high influx of \n\nexpatriate workers lead to the rapid growth of the Construction industry and the \n\nWholesale, Retail Trade and Repairing Services. This is clearly depicted in both \n\nsectors\u2019 output to GDP. By this time, in 1975, Construction accounted for 15,37% \n\nof GDP while Wholesale, Retail Trade and Repairing Services registered 15,20% \n\nof GDP. These were the most relevant industries within the non-oil sector and \n\nalso right after the oil sector in 1975. The Real Estate industry was also growing \n\ndue to the increase in population and the need for housing but it accounted for \n\nonly 4,36% of total GDP. However, the Manufacturing industry \u2013 one of the \n\ndrivers of the process of diversification as well as industrialization \u2013 accounted \n\nfor only 0,91% of the GDP in 1975. \n\n \n\nAccording to Ghanem (2001), \u00abThe difference in the output and the contribution \n\nto GDP of the industrial sector in developing countries as opposed to its place in \n\n                                                 \n8  By understanding the process of diversification it is also possible to comprehend the process of \n\nindustrialization. \n\n\n\n 74 \n\ndeveloped countries was seen as the main manifestation of economic \n\nbackwardness and dependence.\u00bb. In a similar line of thought, Economy Watch \n\n(2010) also suggests that there is a trend among economists which are of the \n\nopinion that the manufacturing industry creates wealth and thus it promotes \n\neconomic development as well as social upward mobility. Seznec (2011) clearly \n\nexplains the role and importance of the manufacturing industry as well as the \n\nservice sector to the UAE economy: \n\n \n\n\u00ab\u2026it was obvious that because the region\u2019s geography does not permit much growth in \n\nagricultural jobs, service jobs would be the solution. However, service jobs need something to \n\nservice. Much effort was placed into developing industry, which would create manufacturing \n\njobs and in turn many times more service jobs.\u00bb \n\n \n\nThe engine of the process of diversification for the United Arab Emirates would \n\nbe the manufacturing sector9. However, many efforts had to be taken to increase \n\nand develop an industry that contributed with less than 1% to the country\u2019s GDP. \n\nIn addition during the 1970\u2019s and early 80\u2019s, due to the booming Infrastructure \n\ndevelopment, industrial development outside the oil sector was mainly linked to \n\nthe construction sector\u2019s growth as well as the expansion of the food industry to \n\ncope with the high influx of expatriate workers (Ghanem, 2001). \n\n \n\nAlthough value added growth rate in the UAE oil sector fluctuated throughout \n\nthe period of 1975 to 2000, the manufacturing sector was able to sustain the \n\nsteady increase of its value added growth rate. From 1975 to 1985 the \n\nmanufacturing sector value added increased from Dh 531 million to Dh 13,307 \n\nmillion, reaching Dh 49,982 million in 2000. As a result, the manufacturing sector \n\n                                                 \n9  For the present study, the Manufacturing sector comprises industries that (1) acquires raw materials \n\nsupplied by primary industries and transforms them into consumer goods, or (2) further processes goods \n\nthat other industries have transformed into products. For further information, see e.g. Hvidt (2013). \n\n\n\n 75 \n\ncontribution to GDP increase from 0,91% in 1975 to 8,93% in 1985, and to 13,04% \n\nin 2000. Moreover, by the year of 2000 the manufacturing sector value added \n\nsurpassed that of the construction sector which reached Dh 35,064 million. In \n\nterms of contribution share to GDP construction accounted for 9,15%.  \n\n \n\nDuring the period 2000-2014 the manufacturing sector value added increased \n\nconsiderably from Dh 49,982 million to Dh 132,231 million respectively. On the \n\ncontrary, manufacturing contribution share to GDP decreased from 13,04% in \n\n2000 to 9,02% in 2014. \u00abNonetheless, it is obvious that the substantial increase in \n\nthe manufacturing value added has made a modest contribution to the UAE\u2019s \n\ntotal output growth.\u00bb (Ghanem, 2001). Similarly, other non-oil sectors spurred \n\nalongside with the growth of the manufacturing sector. \n\n \n\nThe real estate sector\u2019s contribution share represented 4,36% of GDP in 1975. \n\nWhile during the 1990\u2019s it suffered from a slowdown and a consequent drop both \n\nin its value added as well as in its output to GDP, the high influx of foreign \n\nworkers and expatriates during the 2000\u2019s increased the output of the real estate \n\nsector. In 2005 it represented 10,73% of the total GDP and in 2014 10,33%. Finance \n\nand Insurance sector also saw an increase in its contribution share from 2,23% in \n\n1975 to 8,32% in 2014, reaching its highest share in 1995 with 13,50% in 1995. This \n\nsector\u2019s growth was mainly due to the increase in the real estate sector as well as \n\nbusinesses and industries \u2013 in the private sector \u2013 that started spurring and led \n\nto the need for financing (Ghanem, 2001; Shihab 2001). In addition, the banking \n\nsector also started to grow. \n\n \n\nThe Transport, Storage and Communication\u2019s sector is also an interesting sector \n\nthat recorded a growth in its contribution share from 3,17% in 1975 to 8,66% in \n\n2014. With the foundation of the Emirates Airlines in 1985 the UAE started to \n\n\n\n 76 \n\nexploit its privileged geographic position, turning itself into a hub for airline \n\ntransportation connecting Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia. In 2003, under \n\nthe umbrella of the Abu Dhabi government, Etihad Airlines was founded \n\nincreasing the relevance of the transportation sector. Most recently, in early \n\n2000\u2019s the communications sector also saw further development associated with \n\nthe technological advancement. Dubai was indeed a pioneer in this sector with \n\nthe development of Free Zones such as Dubai Internet City, established in 1999 \n\nwith the purpose to create a Telecom hub. \n\n \n\nIn a similar way as the aforementioned sectors, Government Services also \n\nregistered an increase in its contribution share to GDP. In 1975 it represented \n\n1,52% of total GDP, while in 2014 it contributed to 5,97% per cent of the country\u2019s \n\nGDP. As this sector also comprises education and health services, it is expected \n\nthat with the increase in population, the development of these services would \n\nfollow, increasing the output of government services sector to GDP. In addition, \n\nthe expansion of the federal administrative structure as well as the public sector \n\n\u2013 through the increase in public schools and hospitals \u2013 also contributed to the \n\nincrease in work force, thus promoting the growth of the sector\u2019s output to GDP. \n\n \n\nAs Ghanem (2001) argues, it is possible to notice a conspicuous sectoral shift and \n\ncontribution to GDP in the service sector \u2013 commerce (wholesale, retail trade and \n\nrepairing services); Transport, Storage, Communications; Finance and Insurance; \n\nReal Estate Business and Government Services. In this sense, the service sector10 \n\ncontribution to GDP increased from 27,5% in 1975 to 45,34% in 1995, and to \n\n49,25% in 2014. As pointed out by Seznec (2011), with the growth and \n\n                                                 \n10  According to the UAE federal government, the service sector comprises the following sub-sectors: \n\ncommerce (wholesale and retail trade), restaurants, hotels, storage, communications, finance, insurance, real \n\nestate and government services (National Media Council, 2001). \n\n\n\n 77 \n\ndevelopment of the industry as a whole, the manufacturing sector would evolve \n\nand create manufacturing jobs that would, in turn, \u201cservice\u201d the service sector.  \n\n \n\n2.3.2.3. Percentage contribution of oil revenues as a proportion of total \n\ngovernment revenues \n\n \n\nOne of the main aims of diversification in the UAE has been the reduction of the \n\ndependence on oil revenues which are subject to fluctuations. As previously \n\nmentioned, this is an underlying risk that can only be solved by increasing the \n\nvariety of national income sources through the process of diversification of the \n\neconomy. For this matter, to understand if the UAE government has been able to \n\ndivest away from dependence on oil revenues it is necessary to analyze the \n\npercentage contribution of oil revenues to total government revenues (Hvidt, \n\n2013). \n\n \n\nFigure 21.

Unfortunately, since 2007 \n\nthe UAE Central Bank stopped mentioning government revenues as well as oil \n\nrevenues in its Annual Economic Reports. For this reason, it is not feasible to \n\nanalyze the period from 2007 to 2015. Nonetheless, it is possible to note two \n\nimportant trends. First, oil revenues vary whenever oil prices and demand \n\nchange in the international markets. The year of 1998 is the perfect illustration of \n\nthis trend. Second, from 1972 to 2006 there was only a small reduction in the \n\ncontribution of oil revenues to total government revenues. In fact, in 1972 oil \n\nrevenues accounted for 90,5% of total government revenues while in 2006 they \n\naccounted for 80,5%. In this regard, the UAE government still relies heavily on \n\nhydrocarbon revenues to finance economic growth and development.  In turn, \n\nthis is still a barrier to sustainable and long-term economic growth. \n\n2.3.2.4. Percentage contribution of non-oil export to total export revenues \n\n \n\nDue to the small domestic market of the UAE, export activity has long assumed \n\nmajor relevance. Furthermore, in the early ages of the Emirates, revenues of oil \n\nexports played a dominant role both in its contribution to oil revenues as a whole \n\nand to total government revenues. In this sense, analyzing the percentage \n\ncontribution of non-oil export revenues to total export revenues will provide us \n\nan indication of the extent of diversification in the UAE economy. In addition, for \n\nthe present analysis total export revenues will only consider earnings resulting \n\nfrom oil and non-oil exports, thus excluding re-export revenues. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 79 \n\n0,00%\n\n10,00%\n\n20,00%\n\n30,00%\n\n40,00%\n\n50,00%\n\n60,00%\n\n70,00%\n\n2000 2003 2006 2009 2012 2015\n\nNon-Oil Export Revenues to Total Export Revenues\n\n2000 - 2015\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\n2000 2003 2006 2009 2012 2015\n\nIn\n b\n\nillio\nn\n\n D\nirh\n\na\nm\n\ns\n\nNon-Oil Export Revenues\n\n2000 - 2015\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFrom 2000 to 2015 non-oil export revenues (figure 22) have sustained a very \n\npositive and continuous trend of growth with only a few minor slowdowns. In \n\nfact, since 2010 they have doubled, from Dh 187 billion to Dh 450 billion in 2015. \n\nFigure 22. UAE \u2013 Non-Oil Export Revenues (In billion Dirhams) \u2013 2000 to 2015 \n\nSource: Central Bank UAE, 2015 \n\nFigure 23. UAE \u2013 Non-Oil Export Revenues to Total Export Revenues \u2013 2000 to \n\n2015 \n\nSource: Central Bank UAE, 2015 \n\n\n\n 80 \n\nThis translates into an increase in the overall activity of the non-oil sector. On the \n\nother hand, non-oil export revenues contribution share to total export revenues \n\nincreased from 30,73% in 2000 to 65,75% in 2015. However, such growth might \n\nbe illusive as oil exports and revenues have decreased considerably due to the \n\nfall of oil prices in international markets in 2014. Nonetheless, if we consider the \n\ncontribution shares of 2012 (44,17%) and 2013 (44,59%), it is possible to note an \n\nincrease, which indicates that the UAE economy has been subject of \n\ndiversification. \n\n \n\n2.3.3. Trade Policy \n\n \n\nThe United Arab Emirates has adopted an open trade policy ever since the \n\nfoundation of the federation in 1971. In fact, this posture towards free trade \n\nconstitutes one of the pillars of the open economic system that still prevails in the \n\nUAE and has brought tremendous benefits with it (Omaira, 2001). The adherence \n\nto the World Trade Organization in 1996 marked the openness and harmony that \n\nstill constitute today both the UAE\u2019s trade sector as well as its trade policies. In \n\nessence, the general framework of the Emirates trade policy aims to liberalize the \n\nState\u2019s foreign trade (Omaira, 2001). As reported by UAE officials: \n\n \n\n\u00abThe UAE believes that free trade is a necessary condition for increased competitiveness and \n\nproductivity in the long run.  Protectionism, in the form of high tariff barriers and technical \n\nbarriers to trade, would only result in a stagnant and inefficient private sector.  It is in this \n\nspirit that the UAE has signed several free trade agreements\u2026\u00bb (WTO, 2012) \n\n \n\nAs suggested by Omaira (2001) as well as the UAE authorities\u2019 report to the WTO \n\n(2012), the belief in free trade and the avoidance of protectionism have led to a \n\ntrade policy that intends to open the UAE\u2019s economy as much as possible to \n\n\n\n 81 \n\ninternational economies. This has been possible by eliminating quantitative, \n\ntechnical and tariff barriers on commercial exchanges between nations and by \n\nadopting extremely low customs duties11 as well as efficient customs procedures. \n\nNo technical, quantitative or tariff barriers are imposed on national non-oil \n\nexports as well (Omaira, 2001). \n\n \n\nAs of 2012 the UAE government emphasized that it perceived the foreign trade \n\nsector as the cornerstone of any economy. For this matter, both federal and local \n\nauthorities have developed efforts in promoting and increasing exports of goods \n\nand services and re-exports, establishing bilateral and multilateral agreements as \n\nwell as reducing barriers to trade. In light of the aforementioned, to understand \n\nthe general framework of the UAE\u2019s trade policy it is relevant to comprehend (1) \n\nthe institutional framework behind the development and implementation of such \n\npolicies, (2) bilateral agreements and treaties on double taxation, (3) understand \n\nthe degree of easiness attached to foreign trade activities, and (4) acknowledge \n\nthe advantages of having effective customs procedures and few barriers to trade. \n\n \n\nInstitutional Framework \n\n \n\nIn terms of institutional framework, the development and implementation of the \n\nUAE trade policy was under the direct responsibility of the Ministry of Economy \n\nand Planning since 1971. As of 2008, the Ministry of Economy and Planning no \n\nlonger has direct responsibility over trade policy matters. It is now under the \n\nsphere of influence of the Ministry of Foreign Trade which is responsible for \n\ndeveloping and implementing the UAE\u2019s trade policy (WTO, 2012). Furthermore, \n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Trade is also responsible for coordinating Federal \n\nGovernment policies with Local Government\u2019s policies (WTO, 2012). According \n\n                                                 \n11 For further information on UAE\u2019s customs duties please see WTO (2006b, p.25). \n\n\n\n 82 \n\nto the WTO (2006b) Secretariat report, the private sector has always been \n\nincluded in policy-making by providing \u00ab\u2026inputs to trade policy formulation \n\nby communicating its views through the chambers of commerce and industry.\u00bb. \n\n \n\nTrade Agreements \n\n \n\nAccording to UAE authority reports, it is with the premise of an open and free \n\neconomy that the Emirates have \u00ab\u2026 signed several free trade agreements and \n\nembarked on negotiations, either individually or with the GCC, on different \n\nregional trade agreements.\u00bb (WTO, 2006a). As a major economic player in the \n\nregion as well as an important transshipment and re-export center, the UAE has \n\nthrived in establishing several bilateral agreements and treaties on avoidance of \n\ndouble taxation across the globe.  \n\n \n\nFrom the several agreements that can be mentioned, it is of relevance to detach \n\nboth the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and the Trade Investment Frame \n\nAgreement (TIFA) that the UAE has signed with the USA. In addition, in 2005 \n\nthe UAE authorities were also negotiating an FTA with Australia (WTO, 2006b). \n\nWith access to raw materials from Asian countries as well as skilled and semi-\n\nskilled labor force, it was of paramount importance for the UAE to ease trade \n\nwith western economies. As of the end of 2011, the UAE had already signed 39 \n\nbilateral investment agreements and 58 treaties on avoidance of double taxation \n\nand it is estimated that at this time, the government had established bilateral \n\neconomic agreements with more than 50 countries (WTO, 2012). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 83 \n\nForeign Trade - Export and Re-export activities \n\n \n\nThe World Trade Organization\u2019s Secretariat report (WTO, 2006b) clearly depicts \n\nthe current status of the UAE\u2019s export policy. According to the WTO\u2019s (2006b) \n\nreport, the UAE\u2019s policy on export and re-export of goods and services relies on \n\nFree Zones, where there few to no restrictions or obligations. Notwithstanding, \n\nthere are no financial, insurance, guarantee or promotion programs to support \n\nforeign companies in export activities (WTO, 2006b). \n\n \n\nThe UAE\u2019s economic free zones are the center for foreign trade activity both for \n\nforeign enterprises and state-owned companies. In essence, a foreign company is \n\nexempt from income taxation, has extremely low customs duties (5% for every \n\ngood except tobacco and related products), and does not need specific licensing \n\nas opposed to non-free zone areas. Export and re-export activities in general are \n\nsubject to few licensing procedures. In fact, \u00abCustoms procedures are simple in \n\norder to facilitate the flow of trade, which includes a large re-export activity.\u00bb \n\n(WTO, 2006b). \n\n \n\nExports of crude oil and natural gas have been directed mainly towards East-\n\nAsian countries (being Japan the largest costumer), while non-oil exports have \n\nbeen flowing to Europe, Middle East and India. In addition, the main \n\ndestinations of re-exports have been Iran, India as well as Arab countries (WTO, \n\n2006b). Imports are very diverse and are usually destined for consumption or re-\n\nexports activities, being Japan, United Kingdom, Germany, India and China the \n\nmain suppliers (WTO, 2006b). \n\n \n\nFrom 2006 to 2010 the UAE exports market penetration increased from a network \n\nof 175 countries to 198 countries worldwide. Nonetheless, according to UAE \n\n\n\n 84 \n\nauthorities, by 2010 more than 77% (USD 17,32 billion) of exports were \n\nconcentrated in only 12 markets, which have been playing a major role in the \n\ndevelopment and growth of the UAE\u2019s export activities (WTO, 2012). Of these 12 \n\nmajor markets, India and Switzerland were the largest export destinations (WTO, \n\n2012). \n\n \n\nIn light of the above mentioned facts, it is estimated that the UAE still needs to \n\ndiversify its share of exports through its large network of markets in order to \n\ndecrease possible fluctuation risks.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 24. United Arab Emirates Total Exports (Excluding re-exports) and Total Exports Annual \n\nGrowth Rate \u2013 2000 to 2015 \n\nSource: Central Bank UAE, 2015 \n\n \n\nThe trend in total exports \u2013 including oil and non-oil exports \u2013 has been of \n\ncontinuous growth with a few slowdowns in 2009 and most recently in 2014.

Despite these \n\nslowdowns, the UAE was able to increase its total exports from Dh 134,87 billion \n\nin 2000 to Dh 684 billion in 2015, reaching an all-time high of Dh 857,6 billion in \n\n2013.

From Dh 48,15 billion in 2000, re-exports registered \n\nan all-time high in 2015 with Dh 540,3 billion. Although the annual growth rate \n\nhas been decreasing since 2011, it has achieved an average annual growth rate of \n\n18,77% between 2001 to 2015. As UAE government authorities reported in 2012:  \n\n \n\n\u00abThis steady growth is a result of the Government\u2019s ongoing support to this vital sector \n\nthrough a variety of different initiatives.  The ease of customs procedures, low administrative \n\nimport and export costs and the country\u2019s advanced seaport and airport infrastructure and \n\nfacilities, have all reflected the high competitiveness that the UAE enjoys.

Investment Policy \n\n \n\nUntil the year of 2000 the UAE government adopted an investment policy that \n\nencouraged private sector investments and strengthened the government\u2019s \n\ndevelopmental initiatives; encouraged foreign investment \u00ab\u2026through the \n\nprovision of various facilities, incentives and exemptions to investors (e.g. the \n\nestablishment of industrial and free zones in the various Emirates and the \n\nprovision of benefits to investors therein.).\u00bb (Omaira, 2001). More than fifteen \n\nyears have passed and the Emirates investment policy framework has not \n\nchanged.  \n\n \n\nIt is in this regard that the main pillars of the UAE\u2019s investment policy have been \n\nthe successive creation of economic Free Zones and its benefits, which have \n\nattracted foreign enterprises to invest and establish themselves on the country \n\nthrough FDI. Although \u00ab\u2026 the UAE's economic environment is generally liberal \n\nand business-friendly, its investment policy continues to discriminate between \n\nlocal and foreign investors, except in the free zones.\u00bb (WTO, 2006b). As shall be \n\nexplained this has been one of the major barriers for foreign companies to invest \n\nin the UAE.  \n\n \n\nAccording to Santander Trade (2015) there are no incentive schemes for \n\ninvestments or special aids. However, the creation of Free Zones and the benefits \n\nthey provide to foreign companies is perceived as an incentive scheme. In spite \n\nof all the pros and cons, foreign enterprises and investors still view the UAE as \n\nan attractive market. According to Partner and Group (2015) \u00abMultinational \n\ncompanies cite the UAE\u2019s political and economic stability, rapid population and \n\nGDP growth, and efficient and fast-growing capital markets as positive factors \n\nmaintaining the state\u2019s attractiveness to foreign investors.\u00bb. In this sense, it \n\n\n\n 87 \n\nbecomes mandatory to understand the general framework of FDI in the UAE, \n\nmainly FDI inflows, as well as comprehend the institutional framework of Free \n\nZones and the benefits associated to this privileged economic areas. \n\n \n\nForeign Direct Investment (FDI) \n\n \n\nAccording to Drahokoupil (2014) Foreign Direct Investment is an \u00ab\u2026investment \n\nin an enterprise that is resident in a country other than that of the foreign direct \n\ninvestor.\u00bb. As a common practice, \u00ab\u2026the investment is made to acquire lasting \n\ninterest and control of the economic entity, with an implied influence on the \n\nmanagement of the enterprise.\u00bb (Drahokoupil, 2014). As defined by the \n\nOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (2008), for \n\nan investment to fall under the category of FDI, the foreign investor must own at \n\nleast 10% or more of the voting stock or ordinary shares of the investee company \n\n(OECD, 2008). FDI can also take three basic forms: Greenfield investments \u2013 an \n\n\u00ab\u2026investment made to develop a production or manufacturing plant from the \n\nground up\u2026\u00bb, mergers and acquisitions, and joint ventures.  \n\n \n\nForeign Direct Investment is also considered a recent trend, one that started in \n\nearly 1980\u2019s within the sphere of developed economies. As suggested by OECD\u2019s \n\n(2008) Benchmark report on the definition of FDI, this form of investment \n\npresents crucial benefits for economies: \n\n \n\n\u00abFDI provides a means for creating direct, stable and long-lasting links between economies. \n\nUnder the right policy environment, it can serve as an important vehicle for local enterprise \n\ndevelopment, and it may also help improve the competitive position of both the recipient \n\n(\u201chost\u201d) and the investing (\u201chome\u201d) economy. In particular, FDI encourages the transfer of \n\ntechnology and know-how between economies.\u00bb  \n\n \n\n\n\n 88 \n\nWithin the Emirates, as Mina (2014) points out, \u00abFDI is considered an important \n\nfactor in the UAE efforts to reduce reliance on natural resources and diversify the \n\neconomy in the long term.\u00bb. Mina (2014) advances to argue that according to \n\nUAE authorities, \u00ab\u2026FDI is envisaged as one of the pillars for structural \n\ntransformation of the economy.\u00bb as it needs to be stimulated and attracted to \n\npromote the government\u2019s economic agenda leading up to 2021. By taking into \n\naccount the encouragement of the transference of technology and Know-how \n\nbetween economies promoted by FDI, one can clearly understand the overall \n\nimportance of foreign investment to UAE\u2019s aim to achieve a \u201cKnowledge-\n\nEconomy\u201d (UAE Cabinet, 2010). \n\n \n\nAccording to the 2015 Global Investment Report published by the United Nations \n\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the UAE ranks 2nd as the \n\nlargest FDI receptor in the West Asia region, being Turkey in 1st place. Its main \n\ninvestors have been Britain, Japan and Hong Kong, not surprisingly, one of its \n\nmain trading partners as well. As suggested by the UAE\u2019s \u00ab\u2026Ministry of \n\nEconomy Statistics, FDI contributed five per cent to the UAE's GDP in 2014 and \n\ngrew 25 per cent to more than Dh 47 billion.\u00bb (John, 2015). As of 2015, the UAE \n\nattracted USD 13 billion in terms of FDI flows, which represented a 25% increase \n\nfrom 2014 (Santander Trade, 2015). The bulk of UAE\u2019s FDI is now \n\n\u00ab\u2026concentrated in the sectors of hydrocarbons, water and electricity \n\nproduction.\u00bb (Santander Trade, 2015). \n\n \n\nThe easy access to oil and gas resources, low energy costs, willingness to diversify \n\nthe economy and a high purchasing power constitute the strengths of the UAE \n\nin promoting FDI flows (Santander Trade, 2015). On the other hand, the \n\nattractiveness of the Emirates to foreign investors lays in the harmony of its \n\ngeneral economic policies, such as fiscal, monetary and trade policies, with the \n\n\n\n 89 \n\ninvestment domain. The absence of direct business and income taxation, of \n\nexchange controls and capital repatriation, \u00ab\u2026as well as the existence of a strong \n\nand profitable banking sector, plus a large pool of expatriate labor are the \n\ncountry's undeniable assets.\u00bb (Santander Trade, 2015). \n\n \n\nThe importance of FDI to the UAE has long been recognized by its authorities as \n\nstated by UAE officials to the World Trade Organization in 2006:  \n\n \n\n\u00abThe UAE strongly believes that the private sector (both local and foreign) is the true engine \n\nof growth in the long run. Foreign direct investment (FDI) is regarded as crucial in order to \n\ntransfer knowledge and expertise in areas that are not yet the country\u2019s core competencies, \n\nopen new market opportunities by the creation of new networks and create employment in \n\nknowledge intensive and high value-added sectors.\u00bb (WTO, 2006a) \n\n \n\nIn accordance with the WTO, official statistical data on UAE\u2019s FDI inflows have \n\nnot been available until 2006. However, it is suggested that FDI inflows have \n\nadvanced rapidly since 2000. Furthermore, \u00abThe IMF estimates that net FDI \n\ninflows reached about US 11 billion in 2005.\u00bb, and that the \u00ab\u2026bulk of FDI has \n\nbeen directed into real estate projects, and into the free zones \u00bb (WTO, 2006b).  \n\n \n\nIt is estimated that in 2004 alone, 156 Greenfield investments were made. Both \n\nthe liberalization of the real estate subsector in Dubai and the resulting \n\ninvestment boom in housing and development projects \u2013 such as Dubai Internet \n\nCity\u2019s free zone \u2013 contributed largely for the increase in inward FDI.  \n\n \n\n\n\n 90 \n\n \n\n           Figure 26. UAE Direct Investment (FDI) \u2013 2007 to 2015 \n\n           Source: Trading Economics, 2016b \n\n \n\nStatistical data is available regarding FDI total values from 2007 to 2015. Foreign \n\ndirect investment accounted for approximately Dh 52 billion, however, the \n\nvalues dropped considerably in 2009 mainly due to Dubai\u2019s real estate bubble \n\nand the global economic slowdown. Nonetheless, from Dh 20,2 billion in 2010, \n\nFDI increased to Dh 47,5 billion in 2014, which represented 5% of the UAE\u2019s total \n\nGDP. All in all, UAE policies towards FDI have been successful in attracting \n\nforeign enterprises worldwide. Notwithstanding, federal and local authorities \n\nstill need to improve ownership rights for foreigners as well as the efficiency of \n\nthe legal and institutional framework that deal with claims related to foreign \n\ninvestment (World Trade Organization, 2006b). \n\n \n\nFree Zones \n\n \n\nA perfect example of the UAE\u2019s investment policy both to promote the private \n\nsector and to attract foreign investment that brings technology and know-how is \n\nthe development and establishment of Free Zones. The basic success formula of \n\nFree Zones has been \u00ab\u2026100% foreign ownership, corporate tax holidays, no \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014\n\nIn\n b\n\nillio\nn\n\n D\nirh\n\na\nm\n\ns\n\nUAE Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) \n\n2007 to 2015\n\n\n\n 91 \n\npersonal taxes, freedom to repatriate capital and profits, and no import duties or \n\ncurrency restrictions.\u00bb (WTO, 2006b). However, outside Free Zones foreign \n\nownership has requirements, namely, the need for a local agent or sponsor, \n\nwhom must have 51% ownership. In this regard, foreign enterprises outside Free \n\nZones can only have 49% ownership, limiting their control over their activities. \n\nThis has been a constraint in attracting foreign investment to the UAE. \n\n \n\nAccording to the WTO (2006b), the UAE\u2019s first Free Zone was established in 1980 \n\nat Jebel Ali. Since then, Free Zones have been considered a success in attracting \n\nforeign investment and the most up-to-date technological know-how while \n\npromoting the growth of exports, re-exports and transshipment as major \n\ncommercial activities (WTO, 2006b). This scenario led to the creation and growth \n\nof several Free Zones throughout all the emirates except Abu Dhabi with the aim \n\nto attract FDI inflows to foster inward investment and foster their economic \n\ndevelopment (WTO, 2006b). \n\n \n\nAn additional advantage of Free Zones is that there are no minimum quotas to \n\nbe fulfilled within the labor force. This means that foreign companies are not \n\nrequired to have a minimum number of employed Emirati citizens. Outside Free \n\nZones this quota still exists. Another advantage of these areas is that the Trade \n\nAgencies Law, which regulates domestic trade outside Free Zones, does not \n\napply. This means that within the boundaries of Free Zones a foreign enterprise \n\nhas access to several different types of licenses that stipulate the modus operandi \n\nof economic activities in these areas. As reported by WTO\u2019s (2006b) Secretariat, \n\nthe available licenses are the following: \n\n \n\n\n\n 92 \n\n(1) General Trading License \u2013 Allows the holder to import, export, \n\ndistribute, and store any items in accordance with the zone's rules and \n\nregulations. Available in Jebel Ali Free Zone. \n\n \n\n(2) Trading License \u2013 Gives the holder access to import, export, distribute \n\nand store specific items only. \n\n \n\n(3) Industrial License \u2013 The holder may import raw materials, manufacture \n\nspecified products, and export finished products. \n\n \n\n(4) National Industrial License \u2013 Allows the holder duty-free sales inside the \n\nUAE customs territory. Reserved for manufacturing companies with at \n\nleast 51% GCC ownership. \n\n \n\n(5) Service License \u2013 the holder may only carry out the services specified in \n\nthe license within the Free Zone. \n\n \n\nAfter the success of Jebel Ali, the UAE government has increased considerably \n\nthe number of Free Zones. It is estimated that in 2005 there were 22 Free Zones, \n\na number that evolved to 32 zones in 2012. Although Dubai has been the major \n\nforce in developing and boosting Free Zones, the remaining emirates have been \n\nfollowing the lead in creating such areas. In addition, there are Free Zones fully \n\ndedicated to service sectors, such as Dubai Internet City (DIC) and Dubai Health \n\nCare City, while others are industrial areas, such as Ajman Free Zone or Ras Al-\n\nKhaimah Free Trade Zone (WTO, 2012). \n\n \n\nAccording to Omaira (2001), since the early 2000\u2019s the investment policy in the \n\nUAE has focused on developing information technology in the various economic \n\n\n\n 93 \n\nactivities. In light of the aforementioned, the establishment of Dubai Internet City \n\n(DIC) in 2000 rises as a perfect example of the benefit brought to the UAE\u2019s \n\neconomy both by Free Zones and FDI. The DIC Free Zone became the Middle \n\nEast\u2019s sales, distribution and trading center for goods sold over the Internet, \n\nattracting foreign companies such as Microsoft, Hewllet Packard, Oracle, \n\nMasterCard and IBM to operate in the country (National Media Council, 2001).  \n\n \n\nIn 2000 the UAE was ranked 18th in the world in terms of its Internet structure by \n\nThe Economist (National Media Council, 2001).  At this time the UAE was \n\n\u00ab\u2026particularly well placed to focus on electronic communications, with its \n\nestablished telecommunications infrastructure and its participation in \n\nbroadband technologies and projects such as FLAG and Thuraya.\u00bb. This was seen \n\nat the time as a possible competitive advantage for the UAE to strengthen its \n\ntrading links on a global scale. (National Media Council, 2001). \n\n \n\nDiscussions have been underway since 2005 to re-examine the Federal Law on \n\nCommercial companies that imposes ownership restrictions. Although some \n\nprogresses have been made, this federal law still applies as of 2015. This has been \n\none of the major issues that has detracted foreign enterprises to invest in the UAE \n\nand as such, has been a barrier to the growth of Free Zones and FDI inflow.  \n\n \n\nIn October 2015 the UAE Minister of Economy, Sultan bin Saeed Al Mansouri \n\nclearly summarized the importance of both free zones and foreign investment to \n\nthe country:  \n\n\u00abWith 34 multi-specialty free zones in the country, full foreign ownership has now been made \n\npossible with zero tax rates and a 100 per cent profit transfer. All of these factors have \n\nsignificantly helped develop our infrastructure, attract greater foreign investment flows, \n\ntransfer knowledge and technology to the UAE, and build a sustainable knowledge \n\neconomy.\u00bb (John, 2015) \n\n\n\n 94 \n\n2.3.5. Fiscal Policies \n\n \n\nAccording to Encyclopedia Britannica (2014) fiscal policies are \u00ab\u2026measures \n\nemployed by governments to stabilize the economy, specifically by manipulating \n\nlevels and allocations of taxes and government expenditures.\u00bb. For Omaira (2001) \n\nfiscal policy has a direct impact on a country\u2019s economy as well as in its overall \n\nsocio-economic development process. It also has the ability to ease the process of \n\nachieving \u00ab\u2026general strategic objectives of the economic policy through public \n\nspending, both current and developmental, and\u2026\u00bb through the country\u2019s \n\ngeneral revenues. Fiscal policy usually seeks to \u00ab\u2026increase the State\u2019s public \n\nincome to enable it to meet its increasing financial requirements\u2026\u00bb as well as to \n\nreduce public spending so that it does not affect the general development process \n\n(Omaira, 2001). \n\n \n\nOmaira (2001) provides us an overview of the UAE\u2019s government budgets from \n\n1975 to 2000 through which the author suggests that in the period of 1975 to 1984 \n\nthe UAE budget registered an annual surplus \u2013 public income exceeded public \n\nspending \u2013 due to high oil prices in the international markets. Nonetheless, from \n\n1985 to 2000, the UAE budget \u00ab\u2026witnessed an increasing annual deficit due to \n\nan increase in public spending and fluctuations in public income.\u00bb (Omaira, \n\n2001). Once more, this was due to the fall of oil prices and the large dependence \n\non the contribution of oil revenues to public revenues.  \n\n \n\nIn spite of \u00ab\u2026diligent efforts to rationalize public spending, both current and \n\ndevelopmental\u2026\u00bb public expenses were increasing between 1985 to 2000 \u00ab\u2026due \n\nto the increasing financial burdens entailed by expenditure on various projects, \n\nsalaries and wages, purchases of goods and services, and aids and subsidies to \n\nthe various economic sectors and activities.\u00bb (Omaira, 2001). Reliance on oil \n\n\n\n 95 \n\nrevenues and the growth of public spending were two of the main reasons for \n\nthe deficit scenario the UAE faced in 2000. \n\n \n\nIt was also in this same year of 2000 that the UAE federal government adopted a \n\nnew fiscal system \u00ab\u2026for the management of public spending based on efficiency \n\nin the use of resources instead of the method of comprehensive development, \n\nwith a view to rationalizing spending and increasing its effectiveness.\u00bb (Omaira, \n\n2001). According to a report from the Secretariat of the World Trade Organization \n\n(2006b), the  UAE Federal Government took steps in reducing public \n\nexpenditure by containing the growth of spending, reducing agriculture \n\nsubsidies and increase petrol prices by an average of 20% (WTO, 2006b).  \n\n \n\nAs a result of a more prudent management of public spending, the UAE\u2019s public \n\ndeficit decreased significantly to less than 1% of total public expenditures (WTO, \n\n2006a). The UAE economy started to recover in 2010 benefiting from its pruden \n\nfiscal management reform as well as higher oil prices and increased demand \n\nfrom trading partners (WTO, 2012). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 27. United Arab Emirates Government Expenditures from 1998 to 2014 \n\nSource: Trading Economics, 2016c \n\n\n\n 96 \n\nAs figure 27 illustrates, the nominal values of the UAE\u2019s government expenditure \n\nstabilized throughout 2004 to 2007, which implies that the new fiscal system \n\nadopted in 2000 was producing results in slowing the growth of public spending. \n\nAlthough in 2010 the federal government was able to reduce public spending, \n\nfrom 2008 until 2014 the nominal values of government expenditures have in fact \n\nincreased considerably. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 28. United Arab Emirates Government Budget (% of GDP) from 1998 to 2014 \n\nSource: Trading Economics, 2016a \n\n \n\nNonetheless, as \u00ab\u2026a result of the prudent management of public revenue, the \n\npublic deficit\u2026\u00bb declined from 17,7% of GDP from 2009 to 3,1% in 2010, reaching \n\na public surplus of 4,1 % of GDP in 2011 as depicted above in figure 28 (WTO, \n\n2012). It is also important to note that, again, the increase in oil prices and, thus \n\nin oil revenues, contributed largely for the occurrence of fluctuations in the \n\ngovernment\u2019s budget. \n\n \n\nIn addition to fiscal policies towards the management of public expenditures, the \n\nUAE government has also adopted highly attractive policies in the field of \n\n-20,00\n\n-15,00\n\n-10,00\n\n-5,00\n\n0,00\n\n5,00\n\n10,00\n\n15,00\n\n20,00\n\n2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014\n\np\ne\nrce\n\nn\nt o\n\nf G\nD\n\nP\n\nUAE Government Budget (% of GDP) - 1998 to 2014\n\n\n\n 97 \n\nincome taxation that have contributed largely to foster both foreign investment \n\nand the private sector. As the Emirati authorities reported to the WTO (2006a): \n\n \n\n\u00abThe UAE maintains the belief that income tax exemptions encourage an increase in FDI and \n\na more vibrant private sector development. All free zones therefore benefit from zero income \n\ntax. Moreover, the UAE believes that a balanced public budget is conducive to economic \n\ngrowth in the long run.\u00bb  \n\n \n\nThe above statement clearly demonstrates the linkages between the UAE\u2019s fiscal \n\npolicies with the remaining policy fields, such as investment and trade policies \n\nthat are mainly directed towards the private sector, the attraction of foreign \n\ninvestment and the development of commercial exchanges between countries. \n\nFor this matter, it is possible to note that the UAE\u2019s fiscal policies have been \n\nenablers of the general strategic objectives of the government\u2019s economic policy \n\n(Omaira, 2001). \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.6. Monetary Policy \n\n \n\nAccording to Omaira (2001) the UAE government adopts a \u00ab\u2026monetary policy \n\n[\u2026] that suits the open economic system and the objectives of the overall \n\neconomic policy being followed.\u00bb. Although this statement dates back to 2001, \n\nthe overall goal of the UAE\u2019s monetary and credit policy have not changed much. \n\nAs Omaira (2001) points out: \n\n \n\n\u00abThe [UAE] monetary policy aims to preserve the strength of the dirham and its exchange rate \n\nagainst foreign currencies by applying a credit policy that seeks to meet local demand on \n\n\n\n 98 \n\ncredits and hard currencies with a view to stimulating economic activity and encouraging \n\nprivate investments in the various sectors.\u00bb \n\n \n\nThe Central Bank of the UAE (CBU) is responsible for designing and \n\nimplementing the country\u2019s monetary policies (WTO, 2006b). In this sense, one \n\nof the main aims of the CBU, as already suggested, is to preserve the strength of \n\nthe UAE dirham, which is the national currency and is pegged to the US dollar. \n\nAccording to the WTO (2006b), \u00abThe mid-point between the official buying and \n\nselling rates for the dirham has been Dh 3.6725 per US $1.\u00bb. By pegging the \n\ndirham to the US dollar the CBU adopted an exchange-rate policy of pegging its \n\n(the CBU) rate of exchange to another country\u2019s currency, in this case, the US \n\ndollar.  \n\n \n\nA currency peg is a fixed exchange-rate, which facilitates trade by allowing both \n\nimporters and exporters to know exactly what kind of exchange rate to expect for \n\ntheir transactions. Furthermore, according to the WTO (2006b) \u00abThe UAE's \n\nexchange system is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for \n\ninternational transactions\u00bb, which in turn increases trade activities and attracts \n\nforeign investors. All in all, the UAE\u2019s monetary policy has been at par with \n\ntrade, investment and fiscal policies in further developing the economy. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 99 \n\n2.4. The Dubai Model \n\n \n\nSince 1975 Dubai has been able to develop and sustain one of the highest GDP \n\ngrowth rates in the world, 9% between 1975 and 2011 (Al Faris &amp; Soto, 2015). \n\nAccording to Callen et al. (2014), Dubai has also been showcased as a model not \n\nonly for the UAE but to the neighboring GCC countries due to its \u00ab\u2026business-\n\nfriendly environment, light regulations, modern infrastructure, and efficiency in \n\nproject implementation\u2026\u00bb. Of all the seven emirates, Dubai \u00ab\u2026has been the \n\nmost proactive and eager emirate in its attempt at diversification in the GCC \n\nregion (Hvidt, 2013).  \n\n \n\nIt was during the mid-1990\u2019s that Dubai authorities envisaged a new vision for \n\nemirate: to become the business hub of the Gulf region as well as the driving force \n\nbehind reform (Al Faris &amp; Soto, 2015). As suggested by Hvidt (2013) and Al Faris \n\nand Soto (2015) major initiatives were launched in late 1990\u2019s until mid-2000\u2019s \n\nthat would introduce a series of \u201cnew\u2019s\u201d and first\u2019s\u201d, change the structure of \n\nDubai\u2019s economy and turn it into a business hub for the Middle East. According \n\nto Al Faris and Soto (2015) it is possible to detach various initiatives such as \n\n\u201cDestination Dubai\u201d which was focused on developing Tourism, \u201cHub Dubai\u201d \n\nthat intended to transform the emirate into a regional center for global trade and \n\ntransshipment, and \u201ce-Dubai\u201d which had the major role of developing the city \n\ninto a global capital for information technology and e-commerce. \n\n \n\nIt was also during this period that Dubai channeled its oil revenues to finance \n\nambitious public investment programmes (particularly in infrastructure), and \n\n\u00ab\u2026 embarked on large-scale property development and overseas investments to \n\naccelerate the diversification of its economy.\u00bb (Al Faris &amp; Soto, 2015). The \n\ncontraction of oil production in early 2000\u2019s led to further efforts to diversify \n\n\n\n 100 \n\nDubai\u2019s economy. According to Al Faris and Soto (2015) wholesale and retail \n\ntrade, real estate, manufacturing, construction transport, storage and \n\ncommunication, and the financial sector were the six sectors that contributed the \n\nmost for the diversification of Dubai\u2019s economy. Furthermore, \u00abThe share from \n\nthese six sectors increased from a low of 40 % in the 1980\u2019s to 94% in 2011.\u00bb (Al \n\nFaris &amp; Soto, 2015) \n\n \n\nDue to Dubai\u2019s ambitious public investment projects to develop its \n\ninfrastructures (roads, airports, seaports, among others) and business-friendly \n\npolicies, it was able to transform itself into a regional business-hub. In fact, by \n\n2012, Dubai\u2019s wholesale and retail trade sector had a contribution share of more \n\nthan 31% of GDP. Both manufacturing and transports came right after \n\ncontributing each to 14% of the GDP; real estate had a share of 13%, followed by \n\nthe financial sector with a contribution share of 12% and construction 9% (Al \n\nFaris &amp; Soto, 2015).

According to Al Faris and Soto (2015) Dubai\u2019s \n\neconomic development was achieved through four strategic pillars: (1) \n\ndiversification of the economy; (2) development and expansion of the \n\ninfrastructure; (3) development of the financial sector and establishment of Dubai \n\nFinancial Market; and the establishment of Free Zones to attract foreign \n\ninvestment of multinational enterprises. \n\n \n\nOn a complementary and broader view, Hvidt (2013) suggests the existence of a \n\n\u201cDubai Model\u201d of economic development, which contains nine key elements as \n\nfollows:  \n\n \n\n\u00ab(1) government led-development, 2) fast decision making and \u201cfast-track\u201d development, 3) a \n\nflexible labor force through importing expatriates, 4) bypassing industrialization and creating \n\na service economy, 5) internationalizing service provision, 6) creating investment \n\nopportunities, 7) supply generated demand, 8) market positioning via branding, and 9) \n\ndevelopment in cooperation with international partners.\u00bb \n\n \n\nFigure 30.

In this sense, Dubai\u2019s \n\npolicy framework should be looked up to as a model to consider for the UAE \n\neconomic development as a whole.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 103 \n\n \n\n \n\n3. Findings and Contributions \n\n3.1. Findings \n\n \n\nBy taking into account the present work\u2019s research question \u2013\u201cWhat were the \n\npolicies adopted by the United Arab Emirates Federal Government that made \n\nthe Emirates economy a case of success?\u201d\u2013 as well as its underlying goals, it was \n\nmandatory to develop a framework of analysis. The \u201ctwo-building block\u201d \n\nrationale followed throughout the present work intended to address the \u201ccase of \n\neconomic success\u201d and then the economic policies that propelled such success. It \n\nwas in light of the aforementioned that the first building block started by taking \n\na more historical and qualitative approach to depict the economic background of \n\nthe United Arab Emirates when it was formed in 1971. Through qualitative data \n\nit was possible to gather perspectives from various authors and consolidate it \n\ninto one single interpretation of the UAE economy years before the country\u2019s \n\nestablishment.  \n\n \n\nFindings suggest that between late 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s the Trucial States \u2013 which \n\nform the present UAE - were marked by a subsistence economy which was \n\ncharacterized by agriculture, pearling extraction, fishing and trading activities \n\n(Al Sadik, 2001; Butt, 2001; Shihab, 2001). With a population of no more than \n\n180,000 in 1968, the former Trucial States still faced underdevelopment and \n\npresented several deficiencies within its seven emirates (Al Abed, 2001). \n\nInfrastructures such as roads and ports were underdeveloped and almost non-\n\n\n\n 104 \n\nexistent (Butt, 2001). In the late 1960\u2019s oil exports were initiated and financial aid \n\ncame from Great Britain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain. By late 1960\u2019s \n\nand early 1970\u2019s the UAE initiated its process of modern development.  \n\n \n\nIn order to understand how the UAE evolved from a subsistence economy into \n\nan innovation-driven economy in no more than 44 years, it was necessary to (1) \n\nunderstand the features of the economy (both past and present), (2) analyze how \n\nthe UAE achieved such economic growth by looking at its economic \n\nperformance, (3) identify the main drivers that propelled such economic \n\nperformance, and (4) assess the extent of the UAE\u2019s economic success when \n\ncompared to world economies.  \n\n \n\nConsidering Omaira\u2019s (2001) interpretation of the major characteristics of the \n\nUAE economy, it was possible to identify 5 main economic features: (1) heavy \n\nreliance on hydrocarbon resources and revenues, (2) adoption of a free market \n\nsystem, (3) narrowness of the domestic market, (4) reliance on foreign labor force, \n\nand (5) geographic location. An analysis was conducted to the UAE\u2019s \n\ndependence on oil and gas resources, which suggested that the UAE was and still \n\nis a resource-based economy because its oil sector\u2019s contribution share to total \n\nGDP were always higher than 10% and oil export revenues contribution share to \n\ntotal export revenues were always higher than 40%. In addition, qualitative data \n\nalso suggested that the UAE has used its hydrocarbon revenues to finance its \n\neconomic development. \n\n \n\nBeing a resource-based economy meant that economic performance would \n\ninevitably be subject to variations caused by external shocks. However, the UAE \n\nwas able to achieve record-breaking rates of economic growth (Wam, 2014). To \n\nanalyze the UAE\u2019s economic performance Real GDP was taken into account. \n\n\n\n 105 \n\nConsidering Real GDP growth rate allowed a clearer analysis of the increase in \n\nthe growth and total output of the Emirates economy as well as a comparison \n\nbetween world economies.  \n\n \n\nFindings suggest that from 1975 to 2014 the UAE experienced three stages of \n\neconomic growth. The first stage was from 1975 to 1984 where the economy \n\nexperienced positive and substantial growth. The second stage was in the period \n\nof 1985 to 1999 where the economy felt the oil hurdles with a major slowdown. \n\nThe third stage was from 2000 to 2014 and it was where the UAE economy \n\nachieved astonishing growth rates. The Emirates economy grew from a Real GDP \n\nof USD 27,545 billion in 1972 to USD 249,578 billion in 2014, having registered its \n\nhighest value in this same year. The highest growth period was unquestionably \n\nfrom 2000 with a Real GDP of USD 139,150 billion to 2014 with USD 249,578 \n\nbillion.  \n\n \n\nComparative analysis showed evidence that the UAE\u2019s Real GDP growth rate \n\nfluctuated heavily from 1980 to 1990. Notwithstanding, from 2011 to 2015 it has \n\nshown strong signs of stability. Comparison of Real GDP growth rates between \n\nthe UAE and other countries also suggested that (1) GCC countries present \n\nsimilar trends in the growth rates, and (2) since 2011 UAE\u2019s Real GDP growth \n\nrates have been higher than economies such as Germany, United States, Japan or \n\nSingapore. \n\n \n\nThe UAE has been able to achieve astonishing economic performance and \n\nincrease its economic growth. In this sense, it was of relevance to understand \n\nwhat have been the main economic drivers (or key-sectors) of the economy. As a \n\nresource-based economy, the oil sector (or energy sector) has always played a \n\ndominant role. In 1975 the oil sector\u2019s contribution share to total GDP accounted \n\n\n\n 106 \n\nfor 57,26%. However, the diversification process put in motion by the UAE \n\ngovernment led to the oil sector\u2019s contribution share to decrease in 2014 to 34,58% \n\nof total GDP. With the purpose to diversify the economy and reduce reliance on \n\nhydrocarbons, the non-oil sector has been expanding.  In this sense, from 1971 to \n\n1999 the UAE\u2019s key sectors were Energy, Construction, Food Processing, \n\nManufacturing and Real Estate. From 2000 to 2015 the UAE\u2019s main economic \n\ndrivers have been the Energy sector, Industry, Tourism, Transports and \n\nLogistics, and Real Estate and Construction. \n\n \n\nThe astonishing economic growth the UAE achieved was not only due to its \n\nhydrocarbon resources but also due to prudent policy-making undertaken by the \n\nUAE Federal Government that in many instances led to the expansion of non-oil \n\nsectors such as Tourism, which is now one of the main drivers of the economy. \n\nAs of 2015, this has positioned the UAE as the 17th most competitive economy \n\namong a total of 140 economies according to the WEF\u2019s Global Competitiveness \n\nReport (WEF, 2015a).  \n\n \n\nWhile in the late 1960\u2019s the country barely had roads, it now ranks 2nd in the world \n\nin terms of overall quality of infrastructure and surprisingly 1st in quality of its \n\nroads (WEF, 2015a). In addition, the UAE is now the Middle East\u2019s business-hub \n\nby being equally well positioned in terms of light regulation that favors both \n\ntrade and foreign investment activities. This economic development could not \n\nhave been possible without the current framework of policies adopted by the \n\nUAE government (John, 2015). \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n 107 \n\nThe UAE\u2019s framework of policies that propelled such economic growth comes as \n\nthe 2nd building-block of the present work\u2019s rationale and is the answer to the \n\nproposed research question. The set of policies designed and implemented by the \n\nUAE Federal Government that made the UAE\u2019s economy a case of success were \n\n(1) Diversification of the economy, (2) Trade policies, (3) Investment policies, (4) \n\nFiscal and (5) Monetary policies. In this sense the main goals of these economic \n\npolicies have been (1) stimulate growth; (2) allow the diversification of the \n\neconomy away from hydrocarbon resources; (3) attract investment, both foreign \n\nand local, and (4) create a business-friendly environment with few or no \n\nrestrictions/barriers that support trade liberalization (WTO, 2006b). \n\n \n\nResearch suggests that diversifying the UAE\u2019s economy to divest away from \n\nhydrocarbons dependence was the major policy adopted by the UAE \n\nGovernment to promote long-term sustainable economic growth (Hvidt, 2013; \n\nOmaira, 2001). In this sense, the rationale presented was that trade, investment, \n\nfiscal and monetary policies have been the tools to promote the process of \n\neconomic diversification, the major aim of the UAE Government. The theoretical \n\nconcept of diversification adopted for the present study implied that economic \n\ndiversification meant increasing various sources of national income by \n\ndeveloping a non-oil economy, non-oil exports and non-oil revenue sources \n\n(ESCWA, 2001, apud Hvdit, 2013). \n\n \n\nTo understand the extent of economic diversification the UAE achieved, a \n\nframework of analysis suggested by Hvidt (2013) was adopted. Findings suggest \n\nthat the UAE was able to diversify its economy, increase the non-oil sectors \n\ndimension as well as increase non-oil export revenues. Statistical data supporting \n\nthese findings shows that the oil sector\u2019s contribution share to total GDP \n\ndecreased from 57,26% in 1975 to 34,35% in 2014. Economic sectors such as \n\n\n\n 108 \n\nmanufacturing increased their GDP share from 0,9% in 1975 to 9% in 2014, which \n\nled to the non-oil sector expansion. In addition, non-oil export revenues to total \n\nexport revenues increased its share from 30,73% in 2000 to 65,75% in 2015. \n\nNonetheless, oil revenues to total government revenues did not experience \n\nsignificant changes, as they accounted for 90,5% of total government revenues in \n\n1972 and 80,5% in 2006. As it was not possible to include the period of 2007-2015, \n\nthis is an indication that although the UAE economy has been diversified, it is \n\nstill reliant on hydrocarbons. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe successful diversification of the economy would not have been possible \n\nwithout a general set of policies designed and implemented by the UAE Federal \n\nGovernment. This set of policies is comprised by Trade, Investment, Fiscal and \n\nMonetary policies. Findings suggest that Trade and Investment policies have \n\nplayed a major role in boosting economic growth. The UAE adopted ever since \n\nan open trade policy and avoided protectionism in the form of heavy regulations \n\nand high tariff barriers.  The elimination of quantitative, technical and tariff \n\nbarriers on domestic and international commercial exchanges as well as the low \n\ncustoms duties and efficient customs procedures have contributed immensely to \n\nfoster export activities. These policies have placed the UAE as the 5th economy \n\n(out of 140) with less government regulations, 10th in terms of prevalence of non-\n\ntariff barriers, and 11th in terms of the country\u2019s exports contribution share to total \n\nGDP (WEF, 2015a). \n\n \n\nInvestment policies have been directed towards the establishment of Free Zones \n\nand attraction of FDI inflows. With extremely attractive tax and ownership \n\nbenefits, Free Zones have contributed immensely to attract foreign enterprises to \n\nestablish themselves in UAE through FDI. In this sense, the UAE Federal \n\nGovernment views FDI as one of the main pillars of structural change of the \n\n\n\n 109 \n\neconomy as it promotes transference of technology and know-how much needed \n\nby the country. In light of this scenario, in 2015 the UAE ranked 3rd in terms of \n\nFDI and technology transfer and 7th regarding business impact of rules on FDI \n\n(WEF, 2015a).  \n\n \n\nBoth Fiscal and Monetary policies have worked almost as enablers and/or \n\nsupporters of Trade and Investment policies. Research suggests that the UAE\u2019s \n\nfiscal policy has been focusing on income taxation and management of \n\ngovernment spending. In this sense, the UAE government has strived to maintain \n\nincome tax exemptions and promote prudent and efficient management of public \n\nspending, thus enabling and attracting foreign investment to boost the private \n\nsector. Regarding monetary policies, the UAE Central Bank has pegged the \n\nDirham to the US dollar, maintaining the strength of the national currency and \n\nstability of exchange rates, which in turn has facilitated trade activities.  \n\n \n\nIt is possible to verify that the UAE economy is a case of success and it also should \n\nbe noted that hydrocarbon resources played a major role in promoting economic \n\ngrowth. However, the prudent policy-making adopted by the UAE Federal \n\nGovernment put to good use the country\u2019s natural wealth. In this sense, the set \n\nof macroeconomic policies designed and implemented by the UAE Government \n\nhave also been an equally and important asset in promoting the economic success \n\nthe United Arab Emirates achieved in no more than 40 years. \n\n \n\n 3.2. Contributions \n\n \n\nThe contributions of the present study are directed towards both the Academic \n\nand Business fields. For the Academic field, the study sheds light on the policies \n\nthat guided the economic success of the United Arab Emirates, an oil-dependent \n\n\n\n 110 \n\neconomy located in the troubling region of the Middle East. The study will \n\nprovide a better theoretical understanding of how an oil-dependent country can \n\nuse economic policy to foster diversification and long-term sustainable economic \n\ngrowth. It is also a starting point for further research and investigation on the \n\nUAE\u2019s economy.  \n\n \n\nFor the Business field, this is also a starting point to better understand the history \n\nand economy of a country that is now the Middle East\u2019s business-hub. For \n\nenterprises, the present study should be interpreted as a complementary \u201cguide\u201d \n\nto approach the UAE market as the country\u2019s economic policies are also directed \n\ntowards foreign enterprises. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 111 \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Limitations and Further Research \n\nDue to the extended time frame the present study took into account (1971 \u2013 2015) \n\nthere were several statistical data \u201cgaps\u201d which limited the scope of the analysis \n\nand more importantly, its conclusions. For instance, the IMF (2016) only \n\ndisplayed statistical data from 1980 onwards, while the UAE\u2019s National Bureau \n\nof Statistics (2016) provided GDP data from 1975 to 2014. However, GDP data \n\nprovided by the IMF (2016) is presented in US dollars while data provided by the \n\nUAE institutions is provided in Dirhams. This might lead to distortions of the \n\nstudy\u2019s findings. As such, an effort was made to maintain consistency when \n\nmaking analysis based on statistical data. In addition, the present study only \n\ncontended policies adopted by the UAE\u2019s Federal Government. As such, local \n\ngovernment policies \u2013 being Dubai the best example - were not subject of research \n\nduring the present study, which could limit the extent of the study. \n\n \n\nBy taking the Dubai as an example of economic diversification and local \n\ngovernment policies, it is possible to provide suggestions for further research. In \n\nthis sense, an interesting comparative study would be to explore the \u201cDubai \n\nModel\u201d mentioned in the present work, and compare it vis-\u00e1-vis the Abu Dhabi \n\nprocess of diversification, which is a clear example of differences in local \n\ngovernment policies directed to economic diversification and growth. An equally \n\ninteresting subject would be a more focused analysis of the UAE\u2019s investment \n\npolicies, focusing on Free Zones and/or Foreign Direct Investment. \n\n \n\n\n\n 112 \n\n5.
