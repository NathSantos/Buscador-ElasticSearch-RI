The purpose of this work was to evaluate the quality of water \nsamples from the Atibaia River in an area that is under the influence \nof petroleum refinery using a native test-organism and submitting \nthe data to PCA statistical analysis. Therefore, acute toxicity assays \nwith Lecane bulla (Rotifera) were performed in four locations of \nthe river, as well as physical-chemical analyses. Sampling was drawn \nin the dry and rainy seasons. The bioassays were static and lasted \n48 hours; dead organisms were quantified at the end of the tests. \nToxicological differences among the samples/per location and control \nwere compared by means of the Analysis of Variance. Physical-\nchemical and mortality variables were simultaneously analyzed by \nmultivariate analysis of the principal components and the Pearson \ncorrelation coefficient. Water samples from the exit of the refinery \nstabilization pond (location S.1) were toxic to L. bulla in both \nseasons, with significant differences in relation to the control and \nbetween the seasons. The statistical treatment of data showed that \nmortality was strong and positively correlated with total hardness, \nchlorides and EC, which together with pH presented higher values in \nlocation S.1, in the dry and in the rainy seasons. Due to its sensibility \nto the quality of the Atibaia river water samples, the potential use of \nL. bulla for ecotoxicological studies as an alternative test organism \ncould be demonstrated.\n\nKEYWORDS: multivariate analysis; PCA; bioassays; acute toxicity; \nrotifer.\n\nRESUMO: Em virtude da diversidade de ambientes encontrada no \nterrit\u00f3rio nacional, o uso de esp\u00e9cies nativas em estudos toxicol\u00f3gicos \nconstitui assunto de extrema relev\u00e2ncia.

Ensaios de toxicidade aguda com o rot\u00edfero Lecane \nbulla (Rotifera) e an\u00e1lises f\u00edsico-qu\u00edmicas foram realizados com amostras \nobtidas em quatro diferentes pontos do rio em quest\u00e3o. As amostragens \nocorreram nas esta\u00e7\u00f5es seca e chuvosa. Os bioensaios foram est\u00e1ticos \ne duraram 48 horas; organismos mortos foram quantificados no final \ndos testes.

Sampling sites in the Atibaia River\n\nGPS equipment: Garmin, and Trex Summit; W: longitude West; \nS: latitude South\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Atibaia River runs through a large industrial and me-\ntropolitan area and several cities use the waters of this \nriver as source of public water supply. Along its cour-\nse, the river receives discharges of urban sewage and ef-\nfluents of many industries, including a petroleum refinery \n(Hoshina et\u00a0al., 2008).\n\nEcotoxicological assays aiming at monitoring bodies of \nwater generally use internationally standardized exotic species. \nIt is known, however, that determining such toxic levels us-\ning native species would provide the ecotoxicological studies \nwith higher representation and reliability. Rotifers prove to \nbe a suitable alternative for test organisms, since they present \nparthenogenetic reproduction, short life cycle and gestation \nperiods, besides occurring in Brazilian aquatic ecosystems. \n\nThe abundance of rotifers shows how important they \nare as one of the largest groups of freshwater zooplanktons in \nlimnological studies, together with Cladocera (Anomopoda) \nand Copepoda. They make up organisms that are frequently \nused in aquaculture and are strongly connected with aquatic \nhabitats in virtually all of their active stages, and only their \nresting stages are drought-resistant (Segers, 2008)\n\nIn a water quality assessment, different approaches can \nbe used, including chemical analysis and toxicity tests. When \napplied individually, they can lead to great uncertainties; \nhowever, if used together, they generate safer data on envi-\nronmental conditions (C\u00e9sar et\u00a0al., 2007). The use of mul-\ntivariate analysis comes as a valuable tool for interpreting the \nobtained environmental data. Principal component analysis \n(PCA) provides information about the most significant pa-\nrameters which describe all the interpretation of the mass of \ndata, data reduction, besides summarizing the statistical cor-\nrelation among constituents in the water with minimum loss \nof the original information (Helena et\u00a0al., 2000).\n\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the water quality of \nthe Atibaia River using the rotifer Lecane bulla as an indica-\ntor-organism, showing its potential for this use. The principal \ncomponent analysis was performed to show the parameters \nmeasured in the water that might interfere with the same \nquality and mortality of the rotifer. This kind of analysis aims \nat identifying the variables that better explain seasonal and \ntemporal variations and the relationship between them.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nSampling\n\nWater samples were collected close to a petroleum refinery in \nthe state of S\u00e3o Paulo, as follows: site (S.1) corresponds to the \noutput of the stabilization pond effluent from the petroleum \n\nrefinery, biologically treated, stabilized for about seven days \nand discarded in the Atibaia River; site (S.2) 200\u00a0 m ups-\ntream of the discharge of effluents refinery stabilization pond; \nsite\u00a0 (S.3)\u00a0 200\u00a0 m downstream from the effluent disposal; \nand\u00a0 site (S.4) 800 m downstream from discharge, as shown \nin Table 1. Sampling was conducted during Brazil\u2019s dry (April, \nMay, June and August, 2008) and rainy (October, December, \n2008 and Februbary, 2009) seasons. All samples were stored at \n4\u00baC up until the moment the assays were carried out.\n\nWater quality analyses\nPhysical-chemical analyses were carried out using the metho-\ndology described by the Standard Methods (Clesceri et\u00a0al., \n1998). The analyzed parameters were hydrogenionic poten-\ntial (pH), electrical conductivity (EC) in \u00b5S/cm, dissolved \noxygen (DO) in mg/L of O2, total hardness in mg/L CaCO3, \napparent color in Pt-CO/L and chlorides in mg/L of Cl-1. \nPrevious analyses on ammonia concentration of the studied \nsites (data not shown) were found between 2.28 \u2013 2.65\u00a0mg/L \nwith no statistical influence on the living organisms.\n\nTest organism\nL. bulla was obtained in Lobo-Broa Reservoir (Itirapina, Brotas, \nSP; 22\u00ba15\u2019S, 47\u00ba49\u2019W), bred in laboratory, being fed with mi-\ncroalgae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata containing approxima-\ntely 1 x 106 cells/mL. The animals were kept in clean places with \nno substance or toxic vapor, under a 16-hour photoperiod and \nan 8-hour darkness at a thermoperiod of 20 \u00b1 2\u00baC. Breeding \nand test were carried out with dilution water, which had pH \nbetween 7.4 \u00b1 0.2, total hardness of 44\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0mg/L in CaCO3 and \nEC of approximately 160\u00a0\u00b5S/cm.\n\nSensitivity test of L. bulla \nto a reference toxicant\nTests were conducted using juvenile rotifers. There is a clear dis-\ntinction in size between adults and juvenile rotifers. Thus rotifers \nthat appeared much smaller in size in comparison to full-fledged \nadults were collected and used directly in the testing.\n\n\n\n3Arq. Inst. Biol., S\u00e3o Paulo, v.82, p. 1-7, 2015\n\nEvaluation of the Atibaia River water quality using Lecane bulla as a test organism\n\n A light intensity of 600 lux, a light cycle of 16-hour \nlight and 8-hour dark, and a temperature of 20.0 \u00b1 2\u00baC was \nused in all tests, which were conducted in two well culture \nplates with a test well volume of 1 mL. Juvenile rotifers were \ntransferred from their culture dishes to each test well us-\ning a glass micropipette so that there were animals in each \nwell, the ones that had previously been fasting for 48 hours. \nRotifers were transferred under a stereoscope (used at 40X \nmagnification). Dilution water transferred with the rotifers \nwas drained from each well with the use of a glass micropi-\npette, and test solutions were added to the wells. \n\nStock solutions were serially diluted with dilution water \nto achieve the required test concentrations. A definitive toxic-\nity test was undertaken using 2.5, 4.5, 6.5, 8.5 and 10.5 mg/L \ncadmium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich, purity 99%). Testing also \nincluded a negative control (dilution water only, 0 mg/L cadmi-\num chloride). Ten replicates were used for each concentration.\n\nAfter a 24-hour exposure period, mortality was recorded \nfor each well. Rotifers were considered dead if they were not \nmoving. Tests were accepted if there was at least 90% sur-\nvival in the controls.\n\nThe LC50 value was calculated using JSPEAR, the \nTrimmed Spearman-Karber method (Hamilton et\u00a0 al., \n1977). Thereafter, rotifers were exposed to this calculated \nLC50 concentration on a further ten occasions over an elev-\nen-month period. \n\nAcute toxicity test \nusing L. bulla as test organism\nToxicity tests were performed using the same methodology \nfor testing for sensitivity to cadmium chloride, by 48\u00a0hours \nof exposure to the Atibaia River water samples. Twelve repli-\ncates were used for each sampling. \n\nStatistical analysis\nL. bulla mortality data was statistically analyzed on the R \nplatform (R Development Core Team, 2009). By means of \nthe Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), considering the inte-\nraction of seasonal effects on factorial experiments, toxicity \ndifferences of sampled locations were compared with the \ncontrol carried out in the dry season, which did not pre-\nsent mortality rate as in the rainy season. The data regarding \nphysical-chemical variables, along with toxicity data, under-\nwent a multivariate analysis of PCA using the aforementio-\nned software. The\u00a0multivariate factor analysis is an analytical \ntechnique resulting from a set of uncorrelated variables called \nfactors, which explain the variation observed in the original \nset (Anazawa; Ohmori, 2005; Brown, 1998). Correlated \nanalyses were developed for combined data of all sample lo-\ncations for physical-chemical variables and mortality, which \nwere calculated with the Pearson correlation coefficient.\n\nRESULTS\n\nPhysical-chemical variables in the Atibaia River waters analy-\nzed in the four sample locations (S.1; S.2; S.3 and S.4) in the \ndry and rainy seasons can be found in Table 2. \n\n In all sample locations, the color variable presented \nconcentrations above the water quality standards for Class \nII Rivers \u2014 CONAMA Resolution n. 357/05 (CONAMA, \n2005) \u2014 and all of the values recommended by the World \nHealth Organization (WHO) for drinking water quality \n(Who, 2004). The same was observed for DO values in lo-\ncations S.2 and S.4 in the rainy season, and for chloride in \nlocation S.1 in both seasons. Total hardness parameters, EC, \npH and chlorides presented higher values for location S.1 in \ncomparison to the others in both seasons. \n\nThe 24-h LC50 average was calculated to be 3.86 mg/L \ncadmium chloride, which suggests the rotifers used in this \nstudy are reasonably tolerant to cadmium chloride.\n\nThe mean mortality rate of L. bulla was higher in \nthe rainy season for all ocations but S.4. The highest \nmean mortality rates were found in location S.1 in both \nseasons (Fig.\u00a01). \n\nThe Analysis of Variance results verified the influence of \nthe location on mortality; S.1 and S.4 presented differences \nfrom the control (p = 0.00264; p = 0.00324). Seasonal ef-\nfects were verified only for location 1 (p = 0.0148). \n\nThe correlation coefficient of the seven analyzed vari-\nables (Table 3) distinguished several relevant relationships \n(indicated by underlined values):\n\u2022\t strong,\tpositive\tcorrelation\tbetween\ttotal\thardness,\tpH,\t\n\nchlorides and EC (r = 0.71 \u2013 1.0) was attributed to con-\ntributions of residuary waters;\n\n\u2022\t strong,\tnegative\tcorrelation\tbetween\tcolor\tand\tpH,\tco-\nlor and OD (r = -0.88 \u2013 0.91);\n\n\u2022\t high\tpositive\tcorrelation\tbetween\tpH\tand\tDO,\tpH\tand\t\nchlorides (r = 0.68 \u2013 0.72); d) mortality rate was stron-\ngly and positively correlated with total hardness, chlori-\ndes and EC (r = 0.51 \u2013 0.73). Concentrations of most \nphysical-chemical parameters were highly correlated.\n\nAnalyses of PCA were simultaneously applied to physical-\nchemical and ecotoxicological data of surface water, from the \nfour sampling locations, in order to extract the main factors \ncorresponding to the different variation sources in water qual-\nity; the purpose was to determine the main controls for as-\nsessing surface water. The results obtained from the two main \nfactors of PCA showed significant associations of different \nvariants. Liu et\u00a0 al. (2003) classified load factors as \u2018strong\u2019, \n\u2018moderate\u2019 and \u2018weak\u2019 corresponding to the absolute load val-\nues >\u00a0 0.75, 0.75 \u2013 0.50 and 0.50 \u2013 0.30, respectively. Both \nfactors explained 86.21% of the variance in the set of original \ndata, which was considered very good, and capable of identi-\nfying the main variance sources of the analyzed parameters. \n\n\n\n44 Arq. Inst. Biol., S\u00e3o Paulo, v.82, p. 1-7, 2015\n\nR.F. Castanha et al.\n\nThe\u00a0first main factor was prevalent and represented 64.21% of \ntotal variance, with strong positive loads of total hardness, EC, \npH and chlorides; and a strong negative load for color, indi-\ncating an intense correlation with these parameters, and mod-\nerate positive loads for mortality and DO. This can be attrib-\nuted to a mineral component of the river water and could be \ncalled a \u201cgeogenic\u201d factor. The second main factor represented \n26.0% of total variance, showing a strong negative load for \nDO, and moderate positive loads for mortality rate and color, \nso that it could be called \u201canthropogenic factor\u201d (Table 4).\n\nWith the aim of identifying seasonal and spatial tenden-\ncies of the concentration, the sampling locations were plotted \n(Fig.\u00a02). A line over the ordinal plan showed that the samples in \nthe rainy season tended to converge towards the upper left part \nof the plan, where the variables color and mortality had higher \nrelative importance for the y-axis in this region; and along the \nx-axis there was high correlation with color, except for location \nS.1, presented in the upper right part, in which the variables \npH, EC, total hardness and chlorides better explained its loca-\ntion in the x-axis. The samples in the dry season were located in \nthe lower part, slightly directed towards the left, where greater \n\nimportance was placed to DO in relation to the y-axis and to-\nwards color in the x-axis. Location S.1, however, was presented \nin the upper right part, in which the variables pH, EC, total \nhardness and chlorides better explain its location in the x-axis. \n\nTable 2.

Such values were higher than the ones recommended \nby WHO and CONAMA 357/05, which suggest concentra-\ntions that are lower than 250 mg/L of Cl. The concentrations \nin the dry season were higher than those in the rainy season. \n\nTotal hardness presented high concentrations in location \nS.1, being the concentrations in the dry season higher than \nthe ones in the rainy season. High values of hardness may af-\nfect acceptability in water consumption concerning taste and \ndeposition levels; however, ecological and epidemiological \nstudies have shown inverse relationships between the water \nhardness and cardiovascular diseases (WHO 2004).\n\nDO levels in locations S.2 and S.4 in the rainy season \nwere in disagreement with CONAMA 357/05, which rec-\nommend DO values higher than 5 mg/L of O2. Oxygen con-\ncentration monitoring in the aquatic system is important for \nthe biological, chemical and physical systems. The variables \ninvolved in both the increase and the decrease of oxygen lev-\nels in the river water are so numerous and complex that there \nis no model capable of being used without carrying out a \ncareful analysis of local characteristics. \n\nColor results were high in all sample locations \u2013 higher \nthan the 15 and 75 mg/L limits established by WHO and \nCONAMA 375/05, respectively, being the highest values \nfound in the rainy season. Color is generally caused by the \npresence of organic matter (mainly humic and fulvic acids), \nespecially associated with the fractions of humus found in \nsoils of river banks. Color is also strongly influenced by the \npresence of iron salts and other metals, which might indicate \nsources of water contamination with industrial effluents and, \nconsequently, a risky situation (WHO, 2004). \n\nThe results of susceptibility testing with CdCl2 is higher \nthan those found by Nandini et\u00a0al. (2007), who reported a 24 \nLC50 of 0.19 mg/L for the freshwater rotifer Brachionus mac-\nracanthus, but lower than that reported for the water frog Rana \nridibunda a 96 h LC50 of 51.2 mg/L (Selvi et\u00a0al., 2003), and \nthat determined for guppy Poecilia reticulata the 96 h LC50, \n30.4 mg/L in a static bioassay test system, and 30.6 mg/L with \nBehrens\u2013Karber\u2019s method (Yilmaz et\u00a0al., 2004).\n\nSurface water samples from location S.1 proved to be \nhighly toxic for L. bulla in both seasons, presenting signifi-\ncant differences from the control by the ANOVA, as well as \nsignificant toxicity differences for this location between the \ntwo seasons. Values in this location were found higher than \nthe ones recommended by WHO and CONAMA 357/05 for \nphysical-chemical parameters of color and chlorides, besides \npresenting higher pH, EC and total hardness values. Location \nS.4 also showed significant differences in relation to control; \n\nSites\n\nFa\nct\n\nor\n 2\n\nFactor 1\n10-1-2-3-4 2 3 4\n\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n-0.5\n\n-1.0\n\n-1.5\n\n-2.0\n\n-2.5\n\n-3.0\n5\n\nS.4 RS\nS.2 RS\n\nS.3 RS\n\nS.1 RS\n\nS.1 DS\n\nS.4 DS\nS.3 DS\n\nS.2 DS\n\nRS: Rainy season; DS: Dry season.\nFigure 2. Principal component analysis of the physical-chemical \nparameters and toxicity in the S.1 as S.4 sites in Atibaia River in \ndry and rainy seasons\n\nWhen it comes to spatial distribution, scoring parts for the \nsample locations were better explained by factor 1 (y-axis), in \nwhich the variables pH, EC, total hardness, chlorides and color \npresented higher loads. Locations S.2, S.3 and S.4 were near the \nleft axis, with high correlation with color, whereas location S.1 \nwas located next to the right side of the axis, having a high cor-\nrelation with the variables pH, EC, total hardness and chlorides.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nHigh levels of EC, due to the significant amount of dissolved \nsalts, were observed in all river locations in both dry and rainy \nseasons during the study; location 1, though, was in evidence, \n\n\n\n66 Arq. Inst. Biol., S\u00e3o Paulo, v.82, p. 1-7, 2015\n\nR.F. Castanha et al.\n\nhowever, seasonal variation was not significant. The other lo-\ncations did not show significant differences from the control \nor between the dry and the rainy seasons. Water toxicity of this \narea might be due to effluent inputs from fertilizer industries, \npetrol refineries and chemical companies located in the region. \n\nThe correlation analysis supported these results, since \nstrong positive correlation was found between mortality rates \nand total hardness, chlorides and EC and between the vari-\nables themselves, which can reflect the inflow of either sedi-\nments or others related to anthropogenic activities. Strong, \nnegative correlation between color and pH, color and DO \nmay indicate contamination by organic matter from house-\nholds, agriculture, industries or discharges of other pollut-\nants into industrial effluents. However, color and DO slight-\nly correlated with total hardness, chlorides and EC, which \nmay suggest different or multiple sources. \n\nThere are several studies in which the PCA is used to in-\ntegrate environmental physical-chemical data with toxicity pa-\nrameters (C\u00e9sar et\u00a0al., 2007; Riba et\u00a0al., 2004a, b; Delvalls \net\u00a0al., 2002; Delvalls; Chapman, 1998). The results of both \nthe PCA and the Pearson correlations showed strong relation-\nship between variables that may have a common source of \ninflow in the field of study. Color, DO and pH association is \nmainly connected with anthropogenic activities. Chloride, total \nhardness and EC association is attributed to high salt discharges \nfrom industrial effluents or to the elements on rocky materials. \n\nThe first factor (F1) shows environmental degradation \nrelated to some parameters that show the presence of salt (to-\ntal hardness, EC, pH and chlorides), since such variables were \nmoderately linked to toxicity by the analysis of PCA. Toxicity \ndata for L. bulla was also moderately associated with the sec-\nond factor (F2), along with color and DO, meaning that the \nhigh level of color and the low level of DO are leading to \nenvironmental degradation in the places where this factor \npresents strong positive load. Plotting of PCA data due to the \nlocations and seasons verify the differences in location 1 in \nrelation to sampling locations and the dry and rainy seasons. \n\nStudies on acute water toxicity assays are known for the \nspecies Philodina acuticornis odiosa (Hagen et\u00a0 al., 2009), \nBrachionus havanaensis (Ju\u00e1rez-Franco et\u00a0 al., 2007), \nBrachionus macracanthus (Nandini et\u00a0al., 2007), Brachionus \n\npatulus (Sarma et\u00a0al., 2006) Brachionus calyciflorus (Calleja \net\u00a0 al., 1994), Brachionus plicatilis (Snell et\u00a0 al., 1991), \nBrachionus rubens (Halbach et\u00a0 al., 1983); however, there \nare no records of tests with rotifers in Brazil.\n\nThe species L. bulla fits the criteria of availability for \nlaboratory culture, small-sized species and life cycle, organ-\nism availability, representation in the studied ecosystem and \ngenetic stability for obtaining uniform organism stocks, \nbeing used as a test organism assessed in the present study, \nwhich proved to be positive to ponder the toxic potential of \nthe analyzed surface water samples. \n\nCONCLUSION\n\nDifferent statistical techniques used in this study showed how \nuseful they can be to monitor surface water, identifying the va-\nriables that better explain seasonal and temporal variations and \nthe relationship between them. Multivariate analyses were in \nevidence, which allowed identifying the behavior of each season \nsampling and the correlation analysis that identified the relation-\nship among them. The PCA revealed the factors or the sources \naccounting for the water quality variations, proving to be an \nefficient way to manage water resources. Due to environmen-\ntal degradation in the Atibaia River, especially in the region of \nPaul\u00ednia, the PCA technique was used, and the inferences about \nwater quality could be drawn without a reference area. The main \nreason for the Atibaia River degradation in step with the phy-\nsical-chemical and the ecotoxicological parameter evaluated has \nbeen the input of industrial and agricultural effluents, as well \nas domestic sewage, resulting from great changes in the water \ncharacteristics. Specifically in location S.1, the refinery effluents \nanalyzed in this study may contain chemical compounds that \ncould compromise, in this collection, the quality of the waters \nwhere they are discharged. L. bulla is a widely distributed species \nin the Brazilian aquatic ecosystems. It plays an important role in \npreserving primary production in biomass for a large number of \ninvertebrates, and may be a useful and economic tool for moni-\ntoring surface water, since it is easy to culture and carry out toxi-\ncity assays. Moreover, it is sensitive to differences in water quality.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nANAzAWA, K.; OHMORI, H.
