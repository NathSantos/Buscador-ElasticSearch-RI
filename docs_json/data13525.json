Growth increments \ndemarcated by semi-ring porosity and marginal bands of axial parenchyma were observed in the wood of both \nroot and stem. Many qualitative features were the same in both root and stem: fine helical thickenings, and \nsimple and multiple perforation plates in vessel elements; large quantities of axial parenchyma in the growth \nrings, grading from marginal bands and confluent forming irregular bands in earlywood to lozenge aliform in \nlatewood; axial parenchyma cells forked, and varied wall projections and undulations; septate fibres; forked \nand diverse fibre endings. Quantitative features differing between root and stem wood were evaluated using \nstudent\u2019s t-test, and vessel frequency, vessel element length, vessel diameter, ray height, and vulnerability \nand mesomorphy indices differed significantly. Root wood had lower frequency of vessels, narrower and \nlonger vessel elements, and taller rays than wood of the stem.

It occurs in Dense Ombrophilous \nForest (Atlantic Rain Forest sensu stricto), semi-\ndeciduous seasonal forest, riparian areas (Carvalho \n\n\n\n568 Marcati, C.R. et al.\n\nRodrigu\u00e9sia 65(3): 567-576. 2014\n\n1994), and also in  lowland dry tropical forest \n(Tabarelli 1992). The rapid growth makes C. \nmyrianthum an important species for restoration \nof degraded areas (Sansevero et al. 2009). \n\nGeneral descriptions of wood anatomy of the \ngenus Citharexylum have already been reported by \nMetcalfe and Chalk (1950). For C. myrianthum, \nGomes et al. (1989) studied stem wood anatomy \nfrom trees that occurred in eastern part of Paran\u00e1 state \n(South Brazil) and it was the first time that radiate \nperforation plates in vessels were mentioned in this \nspecies. Barros et al. (2001) described the wood \nanatomy of trees from a seasonally flooded forest \nof the Reserva Biol\u00f3gica de Po\u00e7o das Antas (Rio de \nJaneiro state, Southern Brazil). Cambial activity and \nthe seasonal formation of secondary xylem in stems \nof C. myrianthum occurring at S\u00e3o Paulo State were \nstudied by Marcati (2000) and annual growth rings \nwere observed in the wood. Seasonal presence of \nacicular calcium oxalate crystals in the cambial zone, \nwith greater abundance in dry than in wet periods, \nwas reported for this species (Marcati 2000; Marcati \n&amp; Angyalossy 2005). Across this rich body of work, \nonly stem wood was studied.\n\nP e r h a p s  n o t  s u r p r i s i n g l y,  g i v e n  t h e \ncomparative difficulty of collection specimens, \nroot wood anatomy, in general, has received much \nless attention than stem wood anatomy (e.g. Gasson \n&amp; Cutler 1990). When studied, physiological and \nanatomical research demonstrated that within a \nspecies, root xylem has wider vessels than stem \nxylem and that root wood is more vulnerable to \nembolism than stem wood (Alder et al. 1996; Ewers \net al. 1997; Machado et al. 1997; Kavanagh et al. \n1999; Kolb &amp; Sperry 1999; McElrone et al. 2004; \nPsaras &amp; Sofroniou 2004). \n\nThe objectives of this study were to compare \nroot and stem wood anatomy of Citharexylum \n\nmyrianthum qualitatively and quantitatively and \nto relate any anatomical differences between the \norgans to their function and ecological adaptations.\n\nMaterial and Methods\nCitharexylum myrianthum were collected in a \n\nsemi-deciduous seasonal forest in the municipality \nof Botucatu (22052\u201920\u2019\u2019S, 48026\u201937\u2019\u2019W), S\u00e3o \nPaulo state, south-eastern Brazil. The average \nannual rainfall is about 1300 mm, with a mean \nannual temperature of 20\u00b0C. July is the driest and \ncoldest month with mean temperature of 15\u00b0C, \nand January is the wettest and warmest month \nwith mean temperature of 25\u00b0C. The dry season \ntypically extends from May to September (Fig. \n1). Climate data were obtained from the Esta\u00e7\u00e3o \nMeteorol\u00f3gica of the Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias \nAgron\u00f4micas, UNESP, Botucatu, S\u00e3o Paulo State. \nThe Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Meteorol\u00f3gica was about 11 km from \nthe study site.\n\nStem and main root samples from three \nadult specimens (Tab. 1) were collected at 1.30 \nm and 30 cm distal from root collar, respectively. \nWood samples from sapwood were fixed in \n70% ethanol. Transverse, radial and tangential \nsections (10\u201318 ?m) were cut using a sliding \nmicrotome. These sections were double stained \nwith 1% aqueous solution of fuchsin and astra \nblue (Roeser 1972) and mounted on slides in \nEntelan\u00ae synthetic medium. Some root and stem \nmaterials were macerated in a mixture of equal \nvolumes of acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide \nat 60\u00b0C (Johansen 1940) for 12 to 24 hours. The \nmaterial was stained with 1% aqueous solution of \nsafranin and mounted in glycerin. The presence \nof calcium oxalate was confirmed, since dilutions \nwith hydrochloric acid (HCl) produced no effect \n(Chamberlain 1932).\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Climate diagram following Walter (1986), constructed from data obtained at meteorological station \nlocated at Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias Agron\u00f4micas (FCA), UNESP, Botucatu, from 1995 to 2012, showing one well \ndemarcated dry season per year.\n\n\n\nAnatomia comparada da madeira de Citharexylum myrianthum\n\nRodrigu\u00e9sia 65(3): 567-576. 2014\n\n569\n\nWood descriptions follow the microscopic \nfeatures definitions of IAWA Committee (1989).\n\nThe vouchers and samples of root and \nstem wood were deposited, respectively, in the \nHerbarium (BOT) and in the Wood Collection \n(BOTw) (Tab. 1) of the Departamento de Recursos \nNaturais, Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias Agron\u00f4micas, \nUNESP, S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nQuantitative data were based on 30 individual \ncounts per specimen; the statistical requirements \nor minimum numbers of measurements were \nfulfilled: n = (t value)2 * (sample variance)/\n(accuracy of 10% \u00d7 sample mean)2, following \nFreese (1967) and Eckblad (1991).

The trees studied \nhere grew in a semi-deciduous seasonal forest \nwith a dry season of about 5 months. During the \ndry season, soil water availability is low (Borchert \n1994) and thus the roots experience at least one \nform of distinct seasonality presumably sufficient \nto signal distinct growth increment formation in \nthe roots. \n\nSemi-ring porous wood and marginal bands \nof axial parenchyma delimiting growth rings have \nalready been described by Metcalfe &amp; Chalk (1950) \nin Citharexylum, and by Gomes et al. (1989) in C. \nmyrianthum specifically, but only for stem wood. \nMetcalfe &amp; Chalk (1950) stated that semi-ring \nporous wood is a common feature to Verbenaceae \nand, according to Carlquist (2001), this feature \nwould provide functional advantage to the species \nas wide earlywood vessels would accommodate \nlarger volumes of water in wet seasons while \nnarrow latewood vessels maximize the resistance \nto cavitation during the dry season. If this rationale \nholds true, the presence of semi-ring porosity in \nthe roots suggests that the seasonality of soil water \navailability may strongly influence root wood \nvessel diameter. \n\nCombinations of simple and multiple \nperforation plates in Verbenaceae woody species are \n\nDiscussion \nOur observations of the stem wood of \n\nCitharexylum myrianthum are in concordance, in \ngeneral, with previous descriptions of the genus \n(Metcalfe &amp; Chalk 1950; D\u00e9tienne &amp; Jacquet 1983) \nand of the species (Gomes et al. 1989; Marcati \n2000; Barros et al. 2001). The inclusion of root \nwood anatomy in this study broadens the literature \non C. myrianthum and allows for within-plant \norganographic comparisons. \n\nThe presence of growth rings in root \nwood has been demonstrated for a variety of \ndifferent species in diverse habitats, such as in \nStyrax (Styracaceae) (Machado et al. 1997), in \nClusia criuva (Clusiaceae) (Esemann-Quadros \n2001), and in Lippia salviifolia (Verbenaceae) \n(Goulart &amp; Marcati 2008). These findings provide \ncounterexamples to the assertions of Ledebenko \n(1962) and Brown (1971), who suggested that root \nwood is less likely to form growth rings because of \nthe comparative uniformity of the environmental \nconditions in the soil. Esemann-Quadros (2001), \nMachado et al. (1997) and Goulart &amp; Marcati \n(2008) suggested that the seasonal soil water \navailability might be an important factor affecting \nthe formation of growth rings in the wood of roots \nand stems. We agree with these authors and further \nsuggest that by tracking such soil parameters, \n\nTable 3 ?

(Metcalfe \n&amp; Chalk 1950), Citharexylum myrianthum (Gomes \net al. 1989; Marcati 2000; Barros et al. 2001), \nGmelina arborea (Ohtani et al. 1989), and Lippia \nsalviifolia (Goulart &amp; Marcati 2008). According \nto Gomes et al. (1989), there are different \nmultiple perforation plates in C. myrianthum \nwood, including radiate and also derivatives from \nforaminate and reticulate types, and that agrees with \nwhat was found in this study. Multiple perforation \nplates in wood may function in preventing the \nspread of air embolisms by retaining air bubbles \n(Wheeler &amp; Baas 1991). With such a functional \ninterpretation, multiple perforation plates and semi-\nring porous wood would be important contributors \nto the physiology of this species and its growth in \na seasonally dry environment. \n\nFine helical thickenings in vessel walls were \nalso observed by Gomes et al. (1989) and Barros et \nal. (2001) to Citharexylum myrianthum. Carlquist \n(2001) pointed out that the helical thickenings on \nthe vessel walls would increase the contact area \nbetween the vessel wall and water column, and \nmight increase the mechanical resistance of the \nvessel walls. We observed no change in distribution \nof helical thickenings from earlywood to latewood \nin C. myrianthum in stem or root, suggesting that \nan important physiological role related to seasonal \nwater stress is unlikely in this species. \n\nThe variation in the axial parenchyma \nthrough the increment zone, grading from \nmarginal bands and confluent irregular bands \nin the earlywood to lozenge aliform in the \nlatewood, and in some places rays slightly \ndistended when crossing the marginal bands of \naxial parenchyma were described for the first \ntime to this species. Marcati et al. (2006) reported \ndistended rays delimiting growth rings in addition \nto other markers to some species from cerrado \n(Piptocarpha rotundifolia (Asteraceae), Annona \ncoriacea and A. crassiflora (Annonaceae)). The \ndistended rays delimiting growth rings might \nbe advantageous in addition to the other growth \nmarkers helping the dendrochronologists in the \ncorrect distinction of the growth rings limits.\n\nSeptate fibres are common in Verbenaceae \nspecies, and they were observed in the root and \nstem wood of Citharexylum myrianthum. As they \nare living fibres, they could play a role in water \nand starch storage (Carlquist 2001, 2012), and this \nmight be important in the seasonal environments \nwhere the species are growing.\n\nTypically, root vessels are wider than stem \nvessels (Alder et al. 1996; Ewers et al. 1997; \nMachado et al. 1997; Kavanagh et al. 1999; Kolb \n&amp; Sperry 1999; McElrone et al. 2004; Psaras &amp; \nSofroniou 2004). The opposite was observed in this \nstudy in Citharexylum myrianthum, Styrax forest \nspecies (Machado et al. 2007) and Leguminosae \nlianas (Ewers et al. 1997). Christensen-Dalsgaard \net al. (2007) associated the smallest vessels and \nthe lowest vessel frequency to parts of the root \nand stem subjected to the greatest mechanical \nstresses or strains, observing a trade-off between \nhydraulic conductivity and wood stiffness. The \nsemi-ring porosity of the root wood combined with \nlarger amounts of axial parenchyma surrounding \nthe vessels may provide functional advantages \nto the species during the dry season. The axial \nparenchyma surrounding the narrower vessels may \nplay a role in regulating the osmotic potential of \nthe sap in the dry season, permitting the plants to \ntake up water or refill embolized vessels.\n\nIn conclusion, Citharexylum myrianthum root \nand stem wood were different in quantitative but \nnot qualitative features. The root wood had lower \nfrequency of vessels, narrower and longer vessel \nelements, a greater abundance of paratracheal axial \nparenchyma in the latewood, and taller rays than \nthe wood of the stem. The calculated vulnerability \nand mesomorphy indices (Carlquist 1977) indicated \nthat C. myrianthum is mesomorphic, but by \ncomparison, the roots are more susceptible to water \nstress than the stem. The overall physiognomy of \nthe wood suggests anatomical specialization to \nseasonally dry environment.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are grateful to Conselho Nacional \n\nde Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico \n\u2013 CNPq (Proc. 503425/2005-2), Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de \nAmparo a Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 \nFAPESP (Proc. 04/05913-5), and Petrobras for the \nfinancial support, and to Dr. Dirk Koedam for his \nkind and helpful advice in the manuscript.\n\nReferences \nAlder, N.N.; Sperry, J.S. &amp; Pockman, W.T. 1996.
