O trabalho \npr\u00e1tico necess\u00e1rio para a elabora\u00e7\u00e3o desta tese foi realizado durante um \nest\u00e1gio de quatro meses na empresa de servi\u00e7os para a ind\u00fastria petrol\u00edfera, \nSchlumberger, em Paris, utilizando o software de interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00edsmica e de \nmodela\u00e7\u00e3o de reservat\u00f3rios de hidrocarbonetos, Petrel 2008.1. Os atributos \ns\u00edsmicos podem ser considerados formas alternativas de visualizar os dados \nde s\u00edsmica de reflex\u00e3o, que normalmente s\u00e3o representados em amplitude.  A \nsua utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o facilita o processo de interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00edsmica, uma vez que \npermite aumentar a raz\u00e3o sinal-ru\u00eddo, detectar descontinuidades, refor\u00e7ar a \ncontinuidade dos reflectores s\u00edsmicos e evidenciar indicadores directos de \nhidrocarbonetos nos dados s\u00edsmicos originais. Os atributos s\u00edsmicos podem \nainda ser usados para treinar processos de auto-aprendizagem utilizados em \nredes neuronais na predi\u00e7\u00e3o da distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de facies numa \u00e1rea em estudo. \nDe uma forma geral, a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de atributos s\u00edsmicos facilita a correla\u00e7\u00e3o \nentre os dados provenientes do m\u00e9todo s\u00edsmico, dados de po\u00e7os e a geologia \nda \u00e1rea em estudo. Neste trabalho foi utilizado um bloco migrado de s\u00edsmica \nde reflex\u00e3o 3D, com aproximadamente 6000 km\n\n2\n, adquirido no deep-offshore \n\nda costa Oeste Africana. Para al\u00e9m de um teste individual dos atributos \ns\u00edsmicos dispon\u00edveis no Petrel 2008.1, esta tese inclu\u00ed uma avalia\u00e7\u00e3o \npreliminar do potencial em hidrocarbonetos de um sistema de canais \namalgamados identificado na \u00e1rea em estudo. A sua identifica\u00e7\u00e3o, \ninterpreta\u00e7\u00e3o e caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o foi poss\u00edvel com o recurso a atributos s\u00edsmicos \nque evidenciam a presen\u00e7a de falhas, ou outras descontinuidades, e de \natributos s\u00edsmicos sens\u00edveis a pequenas varia\u00e7\u00f5es na litologia e \u00e0 presen\u00e7a de \nflu\u00eddos nos poros das forma\u00e7\u00f5es litol\u00f3gicas. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n \n\nacknowledgments \n\n \nThis works is the end of a step.

A four months internship at Schlumberger, in Paris, \nusing the Petrel 2008.1 \u201cseismic-to-simulation\u201d software provided the \nnecessary data to perform the work described in this thesis. Seismic attributes \nare different ways to look at the original seismic data, which normally is \ndisplayed in amplitudes. Using seismic attributes during the seismic \ninterpretation process allow a significant improvement in the signal-to-noise \nratio, the automatic detection of discontinuities, the enhancement of seismic \nreflectors continuity and the enhancement of direct hydrocarbon indicators. In \nthe self-learning process for neural networks, seismic attributes can be used as \ntraining data to predict facies distribution in the study area. Generally, seismic \nattributes provide a better correlation between the data provided by the seismic \nreflection method, well log data and the geology of the study area. In this work, \na 3D migrated seismic cube was used, with an approximate area of 6000km\n\n2\n, \n\nacquired in the deep-water of West Africa. Besides an individual test of each \nattribute available in Petrel 2008.1, this thesis also includes a preliminary \nevaluation of the oil and gas potential of a system of stacked channels \nidentified within the study area. The identification, interpretation and \ncharacterization of this potential hydrocarbon reservoir was possible using \nseismic attributes to enhance faults and other discontinuities, and by using \nseismic attributes sensitive to subtle lithological variations and the presence of \nfluids in the pore spaces of the lithological formations. \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\ni \n\nContents \n\n \n\nAgradecimentos \n\nResumo \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nAbstract \n\nContents \n\nTable of Figures \n\nList of Tables \n\nChapter I.

Introduction \n\n \n\nI.1. Nature and scope of this work \n\n \n\nThe current thesis reports the main results of the work carried out as a trainee at \n\nSchlumberger Information Solutions (SIS), Paris, France, for four months, under \n\nthe supervision of Senior Support Engineer Hamid Abbassi and Support Engineer \n\nAndreia Mandiuc, and co-supervised by Prof. Lu\u00eds Menezes Pinheiro from the \n\nUniversity of Aveiro. This internship was carried out in the scope of the \n\nDissertation/Final Project/Internship course from the final year of the Master \n\nCourse in Geological Engineering, Geological Resources branch, from the \n\nDepartment of Geosciences of the University of Aveiro, Portugal.  \n\n \n\nI.2. Schlumberger Limited \n\n \n\nSchlumberger Limited is the world\u2019s biggest company providing oilfield services on \n\ntechnology, information solutions and integrated project management to \n\ncostumers working worldwide in the oil and gas industry (www.slb.com (a)). \n\n \n\nThe very beginning of Schlumberger was in 1912 when Conrad Schlumberger had \n\nthe first avant-garde idea to map the land subsurface using electrical methods; this \n\nis currently considered the beginning of the electrical geophysics. 14 years later, in \n\n1926, and after his brother Marcel joined the business, they founded the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \n\nde Prospection Electrique, the starting point for what is nowadays Schlumberger. \n\nThey recorded the first electrical resistivity well log one year later, in France, and \n\nin 1929 the Schlumberger brothers logged the first well in the USA. 1934 \n\nrepresents the beginning of Schlumberger Well Services, the antecedent of what \n\nis nowadays Schlumberger Well Surveying Corporation. In 1962, Schlumberger \n\nLimited entered in the New York Stock Exchange under the title of SLB and today \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n2 \n\nit is spread over several stock exchanges markets such as New York Stock \n\nExchange, Euronext Paris, Euronext Amsterdam, London and SWX Swiss \n\n(www.slb.com (b)). \n\n \n\nAt present, Schlumberger Limited is headed by Andrew Gould (Chairman and \n\nCEO\n1\n) and operates in nine oilfield segments (Figure 1): Artificial Lift, \n\nSchlumberger Completations, Data &amp; Consulting Services, Drilling and \n\nMeasurements, Integrated Project Management, Schlumberger Information \n\nSolutions, Well Services, Wireline and Testing Services. It and also offers \n\nsolutions on high quality seismic acquisition and processing through \n\nWesternGeco. These segments are organized under Reservoir Characterization, \n\nReservoir Production and Reservoir Management groups (Figure 1; www.slb.com \n\n(a); (c)). \n\n \n\nSince Conrad Schlumberger until present Schlumberger grew up and now is \n\nspread in more than 80 countries with more than 84 000 employees of over 140 \n\ndifferent nationalities, reflecting the company\u2019s belief that \u201cdiversity spurs creativity \n\nand understanding of customers' needs\u201d. Schlumberger also built 23 research and \n\nengineering facilities all over the world to develop cutting-edge technology in oil \n\nand gas industry leading to a better and faster response to customers\u2019 wishes \n\n(www.slb.com (a)). \n\n \n\nSchlumberger Information Solutions, is one of the several segments of \n\nSchlumberger Limited, and provides services in software, information \n\nmanagement and information technology infrastructure. Its main aim is to help the \n\noil and gas companies to reduce exploration risks and costs, implementing \n\neffective and safety workflows from exploration to production phases \n\n(www.slb.com (c)). \n\n \n\nSIS includes several technical teams formed by geologists, geophysicists, \n\nreservoir engineers, data management engineers and networks engineers, who \n\n                                            \n1\n CEO: Chief Executive Officer \n\n \n\nhttp://www.hub.slb.com/display/index.do?id=id2636083\n\n\nChapter I Introduction \n\n3 \n\nwork together in order to give the best response and support to the costumers\u2019 \n\nneeds (www.slb.com (c)). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - Schlumberger's oilfield segments and groups division (hub.slb.com). \n\n \n\nI.3. Objectives of this thesis \n\n \n\nDuring the four months as a trainee at SIS, several main objectives, related with \n\nboth scientific and professional/personal experiences were accomplished. \n\n \n\nDuring this period the author became familiar with the daily routine of an employee \n\nin a support team from a service company for the oil and gas industry, learned \n\nhow to use the seismic interpretation and hydrocarbon reservoir modeling \n\nsoftware, Petrel 2008.1 and applied it to a case study. The introduction to new \n\nconcepts related to seismic data processing, seismic attributes, seismic \n\ninterpretation of key seismic reflectors and the characterization and identification \n\nof potential hydrocarbon reservoirs were also initially proposed and these goals \n\nwere achieved. \n\n \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n4 \n\nThe starting point for this work was to learn how to use the basics of Petrel 2008.1. \n\nTo achieve this objective and as a basis for further studies, the author attended \n\ntwo Petrel training courses: Petrel Introduction Course, taught by Petrel Support \n\nEngineer Caroline Martinez, and Petrel Seismic Visualization and Interpretation \n\nCourse, taught by Petrel Support Engineer Marianne Lenormand Berthome. \n\n \n\nAfter an introduction to the latest version of the software and to the new seismic \n\nrelated concepts, the main research work carried out concentrated, on the \n\npotential use of seismic attributes in Petrel 2008.1, for the recognition and \n\ncharacterization of hydrocarbon reservoirs areas, fracture patterns and seismic \n\nclassification using artificial neural networks (ANN). These studies were performed \n\non a previously processed 3D seismic cube (see Section I.4). \n\n \n\nI.4. Dataset and Methodology \n\n \n\nThe dataset used for this work consisted of a 3D processed seismic cube acquired \n\nby WesternGeco in the ultra-deep offshore of the West African Margin. This \n\nseismic volume corresponds to an area of approximately 6000 km\n2\n, originally \n\nrecorded in SEG-D format, with a record length of 9 seconds and a sampling \n\ninterval of 2ms. The data processing flow included basic filtering, amplitude \n\ncorrection and pre-stack Kirchhoff migration. The processed 3D seismic cube was \n\nreformatted to SEG-Y format, the conventional file standard for data exchange \n\nbetween oil companies, resampled at 4ms, to reduce the SEG-Y file size, and \n\ncropped vertically at 2.3 seconds (Schlumberger, personal communication). \n\n \n\nFrom the resampled 3D seismic volume, a quick interpretation of the seabed \n\n(Figure 2) was performed, using Petrel\u2019s 3D autotracking function over a coarse \n\ninterpretation grid of inlines/crosslines. Various variance attribute volumes (see \n\nIV.3.3.5) with different parameters were also computed for the entire 6000 km\n2\n \n\nseismic survey, with the purpose to define potential hydrocarbon accumulations in \n\nthe study area. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter I Introduction \n\n5 \n\n \n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Petrel\u2019s 3D view from above of the interpreted seabed for the entire survey. Colour \nscale ranges from red, for minimum depth values, to purple, for maximum depth values. \n\n \n\nIn order to reduce the time consumption for computing the various seismic \n\nattributes investigated, and also for an easier manipulation of the data and to \n\nliberate some of the system memory, the resampled seismic cube was cropped \n\naround an area of interest identified in several time-slices from the variance \n\nattribute volume (Figure 3).  \n\n \n\nThe delineated area has approximately 2450km\n2\n, with 2327 inlines and 3362 \n\ncrosslines (Figure 4) and it was the work base to test the application of various \n\nseismic attributes and to perform the prospect generation and advanced \n\ninterpretation stages (see V.1 and V.2). \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n6 \n\n \nFigure 3 - Example of a variance time slice at 1000 ms showing a complex pattern of deep-sea \n\nchannels and salt bodies. This variance time slice was, among other purposes, used to define the \n\nlimits for the new cropped volume (see basemap on Figure 4). For a detailed discussion, see \n\nChapter IV. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Grid of inlines/crosslines of the new cropped seismic cube used as a work base to \ncompute the seismic attributes. \n\n \n\nThe study area is intensely affected by salt tectonics and deep-sea turbidite \n\ncomplexes (Figure 5) characteristic of this region of the globe. Tertiary \n\n\n\nChapter I Introduction \n\n7 \n\nchannelized sands represent most of the known hydrocarbon reservoirs above the \n\nevaporite salt sequence in areas surrounding the survey area (Figure 5; Evans, \n\n2002). \n\n \n\nThe adopted methodology for this work were: (1) to test the seismic attributes \n\navailable in Petrel 2008.1, showing examples from different areas of the cropped \n\ncube that best characterize each of the attributes (Chapter IV); (2) to select and \n\napply the best combination of seismic attributes for the identification and \n\ncharacterization of potential hydrocarbon plays (Chapter V). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5 \u2013 Seismic inline showing an area intensely affected by salt diapirs and channelized sands \noriginated from a turbiditic system. \n\n \n\nI.5. Structure of this thesis \n\n \n\nThe present thesis is divided into six main parts. The first chapter introduces the \n\nscope and objectives of this thesis, the dataset and methodology used and a small \n\nreference to Schlumberger Limited and Schlumberger Information Solutions. \n\n \n\nIn the second chapter the seismic reflection method is briefly introduced, \n\nhighlighting the importance of using 3D seismic data versus 2D seismic data. \n\nBasic seismic data processing steps and different methods for 3D seismic \n\nacquisition are also presented. \n\n \n\nChapter three describes briefly available commercial software for seismic \n\ninterpretation and geological modeling, in particular Petrel 2008.1. \n\n \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n8 \n\nChapter four discusses the theory behind seismic attributes and their use in Petrel \n\n2008.1. It starts with a small introductory text about seismic attributes and an \n\nhistorical overview of classification of seismic attributes. Finally, the available \n\nseismic attributes in Petrel 2008.1 are shown with examples from real data, \n\ncomplemented with the respective theoretical explanation. \n\n \n\nThe fifth chapter reports the application of seismic attributes to a case study from \n\nthe Western African margin. They are used to identify and characterize a potential \n\nhydrocarbon reservoir and define the associated fault pattern: this is normally \n\ndesignated in industry as prospect generation. Seismic attributes are then used as \n\npart of an advanced interpretation workflow which includes the interpretation of \n\nkey seismic reflectors and their respective seismic attributes and seismic \n\nclassification, based in artificial neural networks trained with computed seismic \n\ncubes from the original dataset. \n\n \n\nThe final chapter consists of the presentation and discussion of the results \n\nobtained, and the main conclusions that can be drawn from this work, followed by \n\na short description of future work. \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nChapter II. 3D Seismic Reflection Data \n\n \n\nSeismic reflection data results from acquisition surveys carried out both onshore \n\n(on land) and offshore (in marine environments). Taking into account the recent \n\ndiscoveries of giant hydrocarbon reservoirs in particular off West Africa and Brazil, \n\nit is believed that most of the largest hydrocarbon plays yet to be found are located \n\nin the offshore and particular in the deep-offshore. As such, the seismic reflection \n\nmethod and acquisition survey geometries described in this chapter will be dealing \n\nonly with marine acquisition. For a more comprehensive overview of the seismic \n\nmethod, the reader is referred to Sheriff and Geldart (1995) and Yilmaz (2001). \n\n \n\nII.1. The Seismic Reflection Method \n\n \n\nThe seismic reflection method is, without doubt, the most used geophysical \n\ntechnique in the oil and gas industry, as a tool for looking for hydrocarbon \n\nreservoirs, due to its high resolution even for great depths (Gomes and Alves, \n\n2007). In fact, it can be considered that the success of oil and gas exploration and \n\nproduction industry is what it is nowadays due to the high quality of the seismic \n\ndata acquired presently and its more accurate and better constrained \n\ninterpretation (Alfaro et al., 2007). \n\n \n\nThe seismic reflection method (or exploration seismology) is a remote-sensing \n\ntechnique which allows recording a \u201cpicture\u201d of the subsurface with great accuracy, \n\nhigh resolution and great penetration, that can be used to map geologic features \n\nassociated with a petroleum system (Mcquillin et al., 1984; Telford et al., 1990; \n\nChopra and Marfurt, 2005). \n\n \n\nExploration seismology is a descendent branch of earthquake seismology since \n\nboth techniques are used to understand and infer the geology inside the Earth by \n\napplying the same wave propagation principles at different scales. In earthquake \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n10 \n\nseismology the propagation of seismic energy originated from earthquakes \n\n(uncontrolled sources with unknown characteristics), to receivers spread all over \n\nthe Earth, is investigated to determine the large scale Earth\u2019s structure and assess \n\nthe risks for populations associated with those events. Exploration seismology \n\nuses the same principles of wave propagation, mainly for compressional p-waves, \n\nwhich travel inside Earth\u2019s layers, produced by an artificial controlled source of \n\nenergy using short source-receivers offsets. Depending on the survey target, \n\nsources and receivers acquisition geometries are previously planned to maximize \n\nthe imaging capacity of the seismic method for the targets under investigation \n\n(Telford et al., 1990). \n\n \n\nIn seismic reflection data, the information about the subsurface geology, physical \n\nrock properties and layers attitude, is inferred from the reflected wave travel-time \n\nbetween the source and its arrival at the receivers. The two-way travel-time (TWT) \n\nis defined by the time taken for the seismic waves to travel down from the source \n\nuntil they meet a boundary between layers with a different seismic velocity (V), \n\ndensity (?) and acoustic impedance (Z; Equation (1)) where they are reflected and \n\nthen return to the surface. The contrast between acoustic impedance is called \n\nreflection coefficient (RC; Equation (2)).  \n\nAt such interfaces, the seismic rays are partially refracted, partially transmitted and \n\npartially reflected back to the surface where they are detected by a group of \n\nreceivers (Figure 6). The arrival of reflected seismic waves produces systematic \n\nvariations from trace to trace. These variations are called seismic events, and if \n\nthey are consistent in the recorded seismic data, they can probably be interpreted \n\nas real geological interfaces between layers with different reflection coefficients. \n\nMeasuring the travel-time of the events allow to determine the attitude and location \n\nof the geological interfaces which gave rise to each reflection event. The \n\ninterpretation process also takes into account amplitude, frequency, phase and \n\nwave shape variations. Besides trying to identify direct hydrocarbon indicators, \n\n Eq. (1) \n\n Eq. (2) \n\n\n\nChapter II 3D Seismic Reflection Data \n\n11 \n\nseismic data is most often used to identify potential structures for hydrocarbon \n\naccumulation - traps\n2\n (Telford et al., 1990; Gomes and Alves, 1997). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6 \u2013 Diagram showing the path of the reflected seismic energy in one dimension as it travels \nfrom the source to the receivers and it is reflected from the interface between two layers with \ndifferent acoustic impedances. \n\n \n\nDespite of the planned geometry, the acquisition environment and the type of \n\nseismic acquisition (2D or 3D), receivers are disposed along a line, or along \n\nparallel lines with more than one receiver line acquiring at the same time. A \n\nseismic acquisition survey is always composed of: (a) an input source; (b) groups \n\nof receivers, which detect the reflected seismic energy (the output of the Earth) \n\nand transform it into an electrical signal. Depending on the type of acquisition, \n\nreceivers are disposed along a line (2D) or along parallel lines with more than one \n\nreceiver line acquiring at the same time (3D); (c) amplifiers, (d) filters (e) an \n\nanalog-digital-converter (ADC) which converts the signal from analytical to digital, \n\nfor recording (Figure 7; Telford et al., 1990, McQuillin et al., 1984).  \n\n \n\nThe input source produces a previously designed pulse of energy which meets, as \n\nclose as possible, certain predefined requirements such as total energy, duration, \n\nfrequency content and maximum amplitude. These parameters should be set \n\nrespecting the commitment of enough Earth\u2019s penetration, resolution, and good \n\nsignal-to-noise ratio (McQuillin et al., 1984). Receivers should be precise enough \n\nto detect very small ground motion, due to wave propagation, and preserve the \n\nsignal without adding noise. \n\n                                            \n2\n A trap is a component of a petroleum system described as a geologic feature appropriate for hydrocarbon \n\naccumulations and sealed by a relatively impermeable formation. Traps can be structural or stratigraphic (e.g. \nfaults or reefs, respectively) (glossary.oilfield.slb.com (a)) \n\n \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n12 \n\n \n\nFigure 7 - Schematic representation of a general seismic acquisition system. The signal is \noriginated by the source, travels through the Earth and is received at the surface by a group of \nreceivers. Then, the signal is sent to a digital recording system after being transformed by an \nanalog-digital-converter. \n\n \n\nIn marine surveys the most widely used seismic sources are airguns and the \n\nreceivers are piezoelectric sensors designated hydrophones, which are distributed \n\ninside a tube filled with kerosene, called a streamer. All the acquisition equipment \n\n(sources and receivers) used in marine surveys is towed behind the seismic \n\nvessel (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). \n\n \n\nII.1.1.  Seismic Sources \n\n \n\nAirguns are impulsive methods that create seismic energy. An airgun is a \n\ncylindrical device which is filled with high pressured air that is suddenly released \n\ninto the water generating a pressure pulse. Using an array of variable size airguns \n\n(Figure 8) rather than using a single airgun is nowadays the standard procedure in \n\nthe oil and gas exploration industry; this method allows producing a signal that \n\nmatches as close as possible the theoretical desired characteristics of the input \n\nsource.  \n\n \n\nAn airgun is divided into four principal components, a solenoid valve, the upper \n\nand lower chamber, which determine the size of the gun, and a double ended \n\npiston (Figure 9). The power of the airgun depends on the amount of high \n\n\n\nChapter II 3D Seismic Reflection Data \n\n13 \n\npressured air stored in the lower chamber which is released into the water when \n\nthe gun is shot. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8 - An array of airguns with different sizes (commons.wikimedia.org). \n\n \n\nThe air is injected in the upper chamber, flows through the axial opening of the \n\npiston and is kept inside the lower chamber (Figure 9, on the left). When the gun is \n\nfired an electrical signal opens the solenoid valve, the high pressured air reaches \n\nthe underside of the piston producing an upward force on it. This upward \n\nmovement will open the lower chamber, and release the air into the water forming \n\na bubble (Figure 9, right). The charging cycle starts again with the introduction of \n\nnew high pressured air inside the upper chamber which will force the piston to \n\nmove downward and restart the steps described above (McQuillin et al., 1984; \n\nSheriff and Geldart, 1995, Telford et al., 1990). \n\n \n\nThe biggest challenge in airguns is producing a seismic pulse as close as possible \n\nto a spike, because after the first bubble pulse, an undesired train of waves is \n\nnormally created (McQuillin et al., 1984). This effect is called \u201cbubble effect\u201d and \n\nits origin is related to alternately moments of expansion and contraction of the air \n\nbubble formed by the shoot. This phenomenon will depend on the relationship \n\nbetween the pressured gas, the hydrostatic pressure of the surrounding water and \n\nthe net force which accelerates the water outwards the bubble. When the \n\nhydrostatic pressure becomes larger than the gas pressure, the bubble originated \n\nfrom the shoot collapses and reduces its radius until the gas pressure inside the \n\nbubble reaches the water pressure, when the bubble starts to expand again. This \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n14 \n\noscillatory cycle will keep working until the bubble reaches the water surface. \n\nEvery time a bubble collapses or expands it will produce new energy, interfering \n\nwith the first and well designed source pulse, creating an oscillatory signal (Figure \n\n10; Telford et al., 1990). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9 - Schematic representation of an airgun operation. When the gun is charged the lower \nchamber is filled with high pressured air (on the left). The airgun is then discharged by an electrical \nsignal which opens the solenoid valve, allowing air to be released into the water while the piston \nmoves upward producing a bubble of air (on the right) (modified from woodshole.er.usgs.gov). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 10 \u2013 Representation of the bubble effect. The radius of the produced bubble when the \nairgun is fired is continuously expanding and collapsing until it reaches the surface creating an \nundesired oscillatory signal (www.aug.geophys.ethz.ch). \n\n\n\nChapter II 3D Seismic Reflection Data \n\n15 \n\nMany of the acquisition seismic surveys use arrays of variable size airguns \n\ndisposed in a special geometry and fired at different intervals to minimize the \n\nbubble effect. Synchronizing the firing time to align the first pressure peak will \n\nproduce a cancelation of the oscillatory signal, producing a signal with frequency \n\nas close as possible to a spike pulse. Special types of airguns, called GI-guns \n\nwere especially designed to minimize this effect (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). \n\n \n\nII.1.2.  Seismic Receivers \n\n \n\nDepending if the survey is carried on land or at sea, the receivers used are \n\ngeophones or hydrophones, respectively. Standard hydrophones are piezoelectric \n\nsensors towed inside a streamer and transform the compressional p-waves into an \n\nelectrical signal. Onshore, different kinds of geophones are used to detect p-\n\nwaves or s-waves, depending on the survey purpose, and are normally coupled to \n\nthe ground along straight lines (McQuillin et al., 1984).  \n\n \n\nA streamer (Figure 11) is a neoprene tube where hydrophones are placed by \n\ngroups in regular intervals with a total length from 6 to 8km (Alfaro et al., 2007; \n\nTelford et al., 1989). The streamer is filled with a liquid lighter-than-water (e.g. \n\nkerosene) to turn it neutrally buoyant. Connection wires in between hydrophones \n\nand from the receiver to the recording system are also included inside the \n\nstreamer (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995).  \n\n \n\nA streamer is divided in several functional parts (Figure 12). The first component is \n\na lead-in section which connects the vessel and the first group of hydrophones. \n\nThis ensures the minimum interference from the vessel\u2019s movement in the \n\nstreamer. Hydrophones are arranged in sections called \u201clive sections\u201d and in each \n\nsection there are twenty or more hydrophones spaced approximately 1m. In terms \n\nof seismic processing the signal received at each hydrophone inside a section is \n\nsummed up and is considered just one receiver group (or channel). This technique \n\nimproves the signal-to-noise ratio but when there is a great component of noise \n\nacquired with the signal, it can damage the quality of the data (Alfaro et al., 2007). \n\n\u201cDead sections\u201d (Figure 12), i.e. sections without hydrophones, are placed \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n16 \n\nbetween live sections to give the desired length and configuration to the streamer. \n\nThe last section is followed by a tail buoy equipped with positioning tools that \n\ncommunicate with the vessel (Figure 12). The buoy is used both to calculate the \n\npositioning of the streamer and to reduce the drift of the streamer due to water \n\ncurrents. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 11 \u2013 A streamer being deployed into the water. When the vessel is not acquiring seismics, \nthe streamer is kept onboard coiled on a reel (www.ig.utexas.edu). \n\n \n\nIn intervals between channels hydrostatic pressure-based depth controllers, \n\nnormally designated as \u201cbirds\u201d are placed. These devices will induce a \n\ncompensation against the upward or downward movements of the streamer to \n\nmaintain it at a constant depth (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995; McQuillin, 1984). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 12 - Schematic representation of a streamer configuration (Modified from Sheriff and \nGeldart, 1995). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter II 3D Seismic Reflection Data \n\n17 \n\nA stabilized streamer will reduce the noise content of the data and will ensure the \n\nright positioning of the group of channels, in depth and space, to be later corrected \n\nin the definition of the acquisition geometry, during the seismic data preprocessing \n\nstage (see Section II.4). In addition, the towing depth will also determine the \n\nfrequency component of the received signal; if a streamer is towed at less than 8m \n\ndepth than the sea surface, it will better preserve the high-frequency content of the \n\nsignal but it will also increase the noise derived from weather and sea conditions. \n\nIncreasing the towing depth value will preserve the low-frequency content of the \n\nsignal and it will also increase the depth penetration. Traditional towing depths are \n\nfrom 8 to 12m (Alfaro et al., 2007). \n\n \n\nII.2. 2D Seismic Data versus 3D Seismic Data \n\n \n\n2D Seismic Data \n\nTwo-dimensional seismic data is normally acquired along spaced straight lines at \n\ndistances from each other that normally range from hundred of meters to several \n\nkilometers. In marine seismic surveys, a single seismic vessel is used with one \n\nairgun array and a single streamer. Theoretically the content of the 2D seismic \n\ndata has only information about the subsurface vertically below the acquisition \n\npath. However, the received signal has contributions of reflections from points \n\noutside the acquisition path. In terms of comparison, two-dimensional seismic \n\nsections can be considered as cross-section of a seismic volume (Yilmaz, 2001b). \n\n \n\nIn the current days and due to their low acquisition costs, 2D seismic surveys are \n\nthe first exploration method used in oil and gas industry, where not enough \n\nknowledge about the subsurface exists. Regional surveys are carried out to \n\nidentify potential large scale hydrocarbon accumulation sites and decide about \n\nfurther 3D surveys parameters (McQuillin et al., 1984). \n\n  \n\nIn order to improve the signal content of the data a redundant sampling of the \n\nsame reflection point is used, based on the common midpoint (CMP) reflection \n\nmethod (Figure 13; Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). The recorded seismic trace is a \n\ntime-series associated with a source-receiver pair; for processing purposes this \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n18 \n\ngeometry needs to be transformed into common midpoint (CMP) coordinates. For \n\na horizontal interface, a CMP is a point at the surface located at half-offset \n\nbetween the source and the receiver, that is common to several source-receivers \n\npairs (Figure 13). The number of times a CMP is sampled represents the fold of \n\nthe data. A CMP gather (Figure 13, below) is a collection of traces that share the \n\nsame midpoint. This method provides enhanced data quality, suppression of \n\nmultiple reflections and improved general signal-to-noise ratio, especially after \n\nstack (glossary.oilfield.slb.com (c); Robinson et al., 1986; Yilmaz, 1997a). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 13 \u2013 Seismic data acquisition is done in shot-receiver coordinates (on the top) which is \nprocessed as a CMP gather. The lower part of the figure shows a six-fold coverage for one CMP \nlocation (modified from glossary.oilfield.slb.com (c)). \n\n \n\n3D Seismic Data \n\nThe acquisition of three-dimensional seismic data started in 1976 (Sheriff and \n\nGeldart, 1995) and rapidly increased its importance for the petroleum industry due \n\nto its high vertical and lateral resolution even for great depths (Gomes and Alves, \n\n2007).  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter II 3D Seismic Reflection Data \n\n19 \n\nUnlike traditional two-dimensional surveys which only provide information in depth \n\nalong a straight line, three-dimensional seismics provides a cube with seismic data \n\nrelative to three dimensions of the space (X,Y and time/depth) organized in inlines \n\n(with the same direction as the acquisition track) and crosslines (in a perpendicular \n\ndirection of the acquisition path). Depending on the quality of the data in the 3D \n\nseismic volumes, the interpreter is able to map horizons and follow seismic events \n\nalong the entire acquisition survey area and build a reliable geological model of a \n\nhydrocarbon reservoir. \n\n \n\n3D seismic surveys have probably done more than any other modern technology \n\nto increase the likelihood of success of exploration drilling (Buia et al., 2008). In \n\nfact, interpretation of 3D seismic data benefits both exploratory wells (wildcats\n3\n) \n\nand development wells. The number of successful wildcats has increased in the \n\nlast decades with the introduction of new acquisition and processing techniques. \n\nDevelopment wells have also benefited, since the interpretation of three-\n\ndimensional seismic data allows a better knowledge of the subsurface and the \n\npossibility to develop new solutions to improve wells productivity (Alfaro et al., \n\n2007). \n\n \n\nIn three-dimensional seismic acquisition surveys, four to ten streamers separated \n\nby 50 to 150m and airguns arrays of 12 to 18 guns that can be fired every 10 to 20 \n\nseconds at different times, are normally used (Figure 14; Alfaro et al., 2007). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 14 - Schematic representation of a 3D seismic vessel configuration with 2 arrays of 4 \nairguns each and 4 streamers. \n\n \n\n                                            \n3\n A wildcat is an exploratory well in an area where there are few geological knowledge of the subsurface \n\n(glossary.oilfield.slb.com (b)).  \n \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n20 \n\nSince three-dimensional seismic acquisition is a multi-coverage method there is an \n\nimmediate improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio and multiples attenuation, by \n\nsampling the same reflection, or bin\n4\n, several times from different positions. In \n\naddition, the resulting dense sampling grid and data quality makes it possible to \n\nmap not only hydrocarbon reservoirs but in some cases also assess the quality \n\nand the distribution of the oil and gas within a reservoir (Alfaro et al., 2007).  \n\n \n\nII.3. 3D Seismic Marine Acquisition Surveys \n\n \n\nA marine acquisition survey requires that the water column is deep enough (more \n\nthan 10m deep) to allow freedom of movements for seismic vessels with lengths \n\nbetween 30 to 70m. Marine seismic acquisition is faster and consequently cheaper \n\nwhen compared to land surveys, since there are less non-productive time\n5\n  \n\n(Telford et al., 1990; Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). \n\n \n\nThe concept of seismic imaging is inextricably linked with the way in which the \n\ndata is acquired (Amundsen and Landon, 2009). Subsurface imaging using 3D \n\nseismic surveys (Figure 15) is particularly successful in areas with clastic \n\nsediments. However, problems arise, particularly in the deep-water, when imaging \n\nsediments beneath hard seafloors, salt, basalts and carbonate layers. These \n\nlimitations are caused by ray bending on the highly reflective and folded layers \n\nleading to portions of the subsurface remaining unsampled. This effect can be \n\nparticularly important for seismic data acquired in just one direction. The key for a \n\nrepresentative \u201cpicture\u201d of the subsurface is a successful data acquisition with a \n\n360\u00ba azimuth-offset illumination of the target area, only possible to achieve with \n\nthe introduction of new acquisition geometries which consider more than one track \n\ndirection (Buia et al., 2008). \n\n \n\n                                            \n4\n Bins are small square areas (normally 25 m by 25 m) that are treated as reflection points for the purpose of \n\n3D data processing (Alfaro et al., 2007). \n\n \n5\n Non-productive time is the time spend not acquiring data due to field operations. In the marine seismic \n\nacquisition sense means the amount of time a seismic vessel spends in transit from the end of one seismic \nline to the beginning of the next one. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter II 3D Seismic Reflection Data \n\n21 \n\nIn the oil and gas industry new proposed approaches for seismic data acquisition \n\npretend to face the great challenge of today, imaging correctly the subsalt and \n\nreduce the number of dry holes in exploratory wells (Alfaro et al., 2007). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 15 \u2013 Schematic representation of a seismic vessel acquiring 3D seismic data, sailing in a \nstraight path. Azimuth is the angle, at the source array, between the sail path and the considered \nreceiver (Modified from Alfaro et al., 2007. \n\n \n\nTypical Marine Seismic Surveys \n\nIn conventional seismic acquisition surveys, the data is acquired by a single \n\nseismic vessel sailing in straight parallel lines, with opposite directions providing a \n\ncoverage of about every 12.5m, with multiple streamers, over a target area (Figure \n\n16). The seismic vessel is normally equipped with eight to ten streamers and a \n\nvariable number of airguns and source arrays, depending on the target depth \n\n(Alfaro et al., 2008). \n\n \n\nThis kind of survey has a high percentage of non-productive time represented by \n\ncurved path between the end of one line and the beginning of the next. In total, \n\nnon-productive time can reach 50% of the total duration of the survey, therefore \n\nincreasing acquisition costs (Buia et al., 2008).  \n\n \n\nIf well planned, this acquisition geometry is enough to obtain a reasonable imaging \n\nof the subsurface for almost all geological environments. Moreover, since it is a \n\nstandard oil industry acquisition scheme, seismic processing flows are well known \n\nand easily applied with high effectiveness in noise reduction and improvement of \n\nthe data quality. However, there are imaging limitations related to some geological \n\ncontexts which cause ray bending (e.g. areas affected by intense salt tectonics) \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n22 \n\nand when there are infrastructures that obstruct the acquisition path creating \n\ncoverage gaps (Alfaro et al., 2007).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 16 - Schematic representation of a traditional seismic survey. The vessel sails in parallel \nlines with opposite directions, curved paths represent non-productive time because the acquisition \nsystem is switched off. The target area is divided in bins for the purpose of processing the data \n(Buia et al., 2008). \n\n \n\nTypical marine seismic acquisition surveys have narrow azimuth-offset coverage, \n\njust +/- 10\u00ba azimuths for far offsets (Figure 19a), since the illumination is just in one \n\ndirection and the direction of the reflected ray path will be close to the vessel track. \n\nIn order to attenuate the lack of azimuth-offset illumination of this acquisition \n\ngeometry, it should be carried out ensuring the maximum possible trace coverage \n\nper bin (Alfaro et al., 2007; Buia et al., 2008). \n\n \n\nThis conventional acquisition geometry is the mostly used acquisition method to \n\nacquire 3D seismic data worldwide. However, seismic data can easily have low \n\nquality, making the interpretation process very difficult, leading to possible \n\nincorrect reservoir prediction and characterization. Alternative seismic acquisitions \n\ngeometries based on more than one sailing direction have been more recently \n\ndeveloped to obtain more consistent and reliable 3D seismic data (Alfaro et al., \n\n2007). \n\n\n\nChapter II 3D Seismic Reflection Data \n\n23 \n\nWide-Azimuth Seismic Surveys  \n\nWide-azimuth surveys (WAZ) were first introduced in the oil and gas exploration \n\nindustry by BP and PGS\n6\n in 2001 with a testing acquisition survey in the \n\nNorwegian Sea (Alfaro et al., 2007).  \n\n \n\nWAZ is a multi-vessel based method which follows the same acquisition pattern as \n\na typical survey, in straight and parallel lines, but at least two source seismic \n\nvessels are used. The source vessels follow the recording vessel (typically with \n\nten streamers), one behind and the other besides the streamer (Figure 17). Other \n\ngeometries using additional seismic receiver vessels can also be applied \n\ndepending on the complexity of the subsurface target (Alfaro et al., 2007; Buia et \n\nal., 2008). \n\n \n\nThis method has proven improvements for large surveys in areas with great \n\ncomplexity and in subsalt imaging. For an effective seismic data quality, the survey \n\nshould be designed taking into account the greatest possible distance between the \n\nsource and the receiver, in a perpendicular direction to the acquisition path \n\n(crossline direction) and between consecutive acquisition lines depending on the \n\nnumber of involved vessels and the size of the survey area (Alfaro et al., 2007). \n\n \n\nThe wide-azimuth acquisition technique provides a general increase in coverage \n\nfor all azimuths-offsets when compared to the traditional acquisition system. In \n\nfact, for near offsets it provides a full azimuth range, the optimal situation, and +/- \n\n30\u00ba for far-offsets (Figure 19b). \n\n \n\nLastly, processing flows for data acquired by WAZ geometries are derived from \n\nthose applied to data supplied by conventional seismic acquisition surveys, but \n\nafter several basic processing steps. When compared with conventional 3D data, \n\nWAZ seismic data shows less coherent noise, higher resolution, improved multiple \n\nattenuation and much better seismic reflectors continuity and interpretability, \n\nespecially for those beneath salt bodies (Alfaro et al., 2007). \n\n \n\n                                            \n6 Petroleum Geo-Services. \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n24 \n\n \n\nFigure 17 - Schematic representation of a wide-azimuth survey. A seismic receiver vessel sails \nalong a straight path, above the target area, followed by two source vessels sailing one behind the \ntowed-streamer and the other besides the receivers. \n\n \n\nCoil Shooting Seismic Surveys \n\nA new revolutionary technique for seismic acquisition \u2013 Coil Shooting\n7\n  \u2013 has been \n\nrecently introduced by WesternGeco, first tested in 2006 in the Gulf of Mexico, to \n\nsolve the limited range of azimuth-offset fold from traditional and multi-vessel \n\nacquisition surveys (Buia et al., 2008). Coil Shooting (Figure 18) is a single-vessel \n\nmethod, with one powerful source and ten streamers, to acquire high-quality 3D \n\nseismic reflection data in large and continuous linked circles (with 5 to 7km of \n\nradius) (Buia et al., 2008; Amundsen and Landro, 2009). \n\n \n\nLike many other breakthrough technical developments, the idea to acquire seismic \n\ndata along a circular pattern is not recent. In fact, it remounts to the 1980\u2019s but \n\nonly in the last years, with the development of new seismic sources and receivers \n\nand the arising of new tools for precise receiver positioning, did it became possible \n\nthe real implementation of this method (Buia et al., 2008). \n\n \n\nThe acquisition survey is planned in order that the target area is covered by an  \n\noverlapping circular pattern in which the seismic vessel sails, shooting and \n\nrecording continuously (Figure 18), reducing in this way the typical non-productive \n\ntime of a seismic marine survey and consequently costs and survey duration.   \n\n                                            \n7\n Coil Shooting is a trademark of Schlumberger. \n\n\n\nChapter II 3D Seismic Reflection Data \n\n25 \n\nThe result is high quality of three-dimensional seismic data with improved signal-\n\nto-noise ratio, multiple attenuation and enhanced reflectors continuity and \n\nconsistency in every geological environment and even below highly reflective \n\nlayers. It is an extremely powerful method for subsurface imaging since it \n\nguarantees a full azimuth-offset illumination (Figure 19c). \n\n \n\nThe potential noise produced by the circular trajectory of the vessel and the \n\nstreamers is compensated with the introduction of new steering devices, used for \n\nthe receivers, that precisely control the depth, the lateral position of the streamers \n\nand ensure a constant streamer separation. Most of the noise content within the \n\ndata is from cross-currents perpendicular to the streamer direction which can be \n\neffectively reduced with new processing techniques (Amundsen and Landon, \n\n2009). \n\n \n\nAdditionally, the Coil Shooting technique implies lower costs for small to medium \n\nsurveys, when compared to the two methods previously discussed. Being a single-\n\nvessel method makes it also attractive for acquisition surveys in remote areas \n\nwhere it is difficult and very expensive to sail with more than one vessel (Buia et \n\nal., 2009). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 18 \u2013 Schematic representation of the Coil Shooting acquisition technique. The acquisition is \ndone by one single seismic vessel (source and receiver) continuously following a pre-defined \ncircular pattern over the target area to provide full azimuth illumination of the subsurface. \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n26 \n\nFrom the economical point of view and taking into account the huge amount of \n\nnon-productive time for a conventional seismic acquisition survey, it is \n\nrecommended to acquire seismic by the WAZ method for large seismic surveys in \n\nnon remote places and by the Coil Shooting technique for small and medium \n\nsurveys or for surveys realized in remote areas (Buia et al., 2008).  \n\n \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n \n\n \n\n(b) \n\n \n\n(c) \n\n \n\nFigure 19 - Rose diagram of average azimuth-offset coverage for: (a) a traditional 3D seismic \nacquisition survey; (b) a Wide-azimuth survey; (c) a Coil Shooting survey.

Basic Seismic Data Processing  \n\n \n\nStandard seismic processing flows are fully implemented and well known in the \n\nindustry with the ultimate goal to increase the vertical resolution, to improve the \n\n\n\nChapter II 3D Seismic Reflection Data \n\n27 \n\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the data, and to display the seismic events in their correct \n\nspatial position (McQuillin et al., 1984).  \n\n \n\nA typical simple processing flow for a 2D survey is composed of a preprocessing \n\nstage, which includes: demultiplexing, trace editing, spherical divergence and \n\ngeometry corrections, and a processing flow which normally includes: \n\ndeconvolution, CMP sorting, velocity analysis, normal moveout correction, CMP \n\nstack and migration. The processing concepts and algorithms applied in 3D \n\nseismic data processing are almost the same as those applied to 2D data. The \n\nmain differences concern: quality control, statics correction, velocity analysis, \n\nmigration and the way in which reflective points are considered for seismic \n\nprocessing purposes. In 3D seismic data, reflection points are designated as \u201cbins\u201d \n\ninstead of common midpoints (CMP; Yilmaz, 2001a). \n\n \n\nThe seismic data is sometimes recorded in a multiplexed way in which samples \n\nfrom the same time interval from different shots are recorded consecutively. In \n\nsuch cases, the first step of the preprocessing stage consists of demultiplexing, to \n\nconvert the data into a suitable and organized file format for processing purposes. \n\nIn oil industry, the conventional standard for seismic files exchange is SEG-Y \n\n(Yilmaz, 1997a).  \n\n \n\nThe data is then edited in order to detect and correct abnormal traces with high \n\nnoise content or inverted polarity. If basic filtering is not enough to repair the noisy \n\ntrace they should be eliminated since their contribution will decrease the signal-to-\n\nnoise ratio. Basic filtering is also applied to all data in order to reduce the \n\ncharacteristic low-frequency noise originated from bad weather and/or sea \n\nconditions and by undesired movements of the streamer (Yilmaz, 2001a).  \n\n \n\nThe spherical divergence correction applied next is a gain correction function to \n\ncompensate the amplitude effects of spherical wavefront divergence. Finally, the \n\ndata is corrected for the acquisition geometry with the positioning of shots and \n\nreceivers inserted into the trace headers. This simple step is one of the most \n\nimportant in the processing flow and many of the problems that arise at later \n\nstages are originated by geometry definitions errors (Yilmaz, 2001a). \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n28 \n\nDeconvolution is then applied to compress the wavelet shape in the data, recover \n\nhigh-frequencies, attenuate reverberations and short-period multiples, increasing \n\nthe vertical resolution of the reflectors and normalizing the frequency spectrum of \n\nthe data (Yilmaz, 1997a).  \n\n \n\nIdeally, the recorded seismic trace is a convolution of the seismic wavelet, which \n\ntravels from the source through the subsurface, with the reflection coefficient \n\nseries, derived from the properties (in particular density and seismic velocity) of \n\nthe different rock layers crossed by the seismic energy. Deconvolution tries to \n\nundo this natural convolution process, by eliminating the source signature and \n\nderived multiples, obtaining the reflection coefficient series. However, the received \n\nsignal does not contain only information about the wavelet signature and the \n\nEarth\u2019s impulse response. In fact, there many other components such as noise \n\nand limitation on sources and receivers that make it impossible to obtain the real \n\nimpulse response of the Earth (Yilmaz, 2001a). \n\n \n\nThe Normal Moveout (NMO) correction is then applied to data sorted by CMP (a \n\nCMP gather) using a previously created velocity field. This correction removes the \n\nsource-receiver offset effect in a non-dipping seismic reflector, assuming that the \n\nreflection travel-time, which is a function of offset, follows a hyperbolic trajectory. \n\nSince reflections arrive first at nearest offsets and later at far offsets, the greater \n\nthe source-receiver offset the larger the delay observed. In the NMO correction, \n\nseismic events corresponding to seismic reflections are flattened across the offset \n\nrange in order to remove the previously described effect (Figure 20; Yilmaz, \n\n1997a). \n\n \n\nNMO is a dynamic correction since corrections will decrease with the increase in \n\ntwo-way-time and the increase in sound speed of rocks (Robinson et al., 1986). \n\n \n\nAfter a detailed velocity analysis, the resulting velocity field is applied for NMO \n\ncorrection and to stack the data. Stacking consists of summing the traces which \n\nbelong to a CMP location into just one trace after NMO correction (Figure 21). The \n\noutput data will have reinforced reflections, since noise is theoretically random and \n\n\n\nChapter II 3D Seismic Reflection Data \n\n29 \n\nwhen summed tends to cancel, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio \n\n(glossary.oilfield.slb.com (e)). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 20 \u2013 Diagram of six traces displayed before and after normal moveout correction (from \nglossary.oilfield.slb.com). \n\n \n\nThe classic processing flow normally finishes with a migration algorithm. This \n\nprocess attempts the repositioning of the seismic reflections in their supposedly \n\ntrue subsurface position in depth. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 21 \u2013 Data is organized by CMP which are corrected for the normal moveout effect and \nfinally stacked to improve data quality (glossary.oilfield.slb.com (e)). \n\n \n\nWith a proper migration, based on a realistic velocity model, most of the \n\ndiffractions within the data are collapsed. Migration has proven results for \n\nimproving seismic interpretability and mapping of complex structural areas \n\nintensely folded and faulted. This processing algorithm also increases the spatial \n\nresolution of the data. For three-dimensional seismic data, 3D-migration \n\nalgorithms are used (Yilmaz, 1997a). \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n30 \n\nAnother way of applying a migration algorithm is before stack (pre-stack \n\nmigration). Pre-stack migration is an intensive time-consuming and a heavy \n\ncomputation process which allows to imaging reflectors with abrupt variations of \n\nlateral velocities, with non-hyperbolic reflection events, conflict dips, and steep \n\ndiscontinuities. The algorithm is applied trace to trace at each CMP location, \n\ninstead of being applied to the stacked data. Pre-stack migration will solve seismic \n\nimaging below salt bodies which is especially important in hydrocarbon migration \n\nand accumulation detection (Yilmaz, 1997a). \n\n \n\nAll the processing steps should be quality controlled through seismic cross-\n\nsections displays in order to ensure that the quality of the data is not diminishing \n\n(Yilmaz, 2001b). \n\n \n\nII.5. Interpretation of 3D Seismic Data \n\n  \n\nSeismic interpretation is the last stage in the oil and gas industry to prospect and \n\ncorrectly identify hydrocarbon reservoirs on properly migrated seismic cubes. \n\nWithout a consistent interpretation, the seismic data itself is useless (Robinson et \n\nal., 1986). \n\n \n\nSeismic data interpretation is an exhaustive data analysis process. Nowadays \n\nthere is a lot of geological information associated with a seismic volume, which \n\nshould be taken into account. This large amount of information increases the time \n\nconsumption but, if well correlated, reduces the uncertainty to build a reliable \n\ngeological model (Yilmaz, 2001b).  \n\n \n\nThe interpreter must combine the various components of the dataset (e.g. 3D \n\nseismic cube, 2D lines and well log data) in order to recognize seismic patterns \n\nthat can give clues about potential hydrocarbon accumulations sites, depositional \n\nenvironments and the structural geology of the area. This recognition is often \n\nbased on comparisons between the data and a mental database created by the \n\ninterpreter\u2019s experience. As such many people consider the interpretation process \n\nas something in between a science and art (Chopra and Marfurt, 2005). \n\n\n\nChapter II 3D Seismic Reflection Data \n\n31 \n\nThe interpretation is done visually and interactively, in powerful workstations, over \n\nvertical seismic sections, in inline and crossline directions, and in horizontal \n\nseismic sections called horizontal time slices. Available interpretation software \n\n(Chapter III) allows the manipulation and visualization of seismic data together \n\nwith well log data and allows correcting possible mis-ties. This combined \n\nvisualization allows associating seismic reflectors to boundaries of known \n\nlithological layers (Robinson et al., 1986). Identified features such as faults and \n\nkey seismic reflectors (called horizons), are interpreted based not only in the \n\ntravel-time but also in the amplitude content, with the objective of building a \n\nreliable geologic model (Yilmaz, 2001b). \n\n \n\nDirect hydrocarbon indicators (DHI) in seismic data are not as common as often \n\nassumed. Only in few datasets show reflections which can be unequivocally \n\ninterpreted as DHIs. The interpreter will therefore mainly be looking for structures, \n\nboth tectonic and stratigraphic, that can potentially hold hydrocarbon \n\naccumulations (e.g. faults and antiforms; Gomes and Alves, 2007).  \n\n \n\nFrom seismic data alone it is not possible to unambiguously identify lithologic \n\nsequences or the fluid content filling the pore spaces. This information is normally \n\nachieved with the use of modeling algorithms, well log data and more recently \n\n(Robinson et al., 1986) using seismic attributes (Chopra and Marfurt, 2005). In \n\nfact, seismic attributes are used as a starting point or complement in the \n\ninterpretation process. \n\n \n\nA careful interpretation of 3D seismic data allows accurately mapping geological \n\nfeatures, defining the structural geology and infering about lithological variations \n\nand their distributions, thereby characterizing the respective depositional systems \n\nin the survey area. A fully understanding of the study area is the key for success in \n\noil and gas exploration and production industries. \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\n \n\nChapter III. 3D Seismic Interpretation in \n\nPetrel \n\n \n\nThe development of new technology and the growth of 3D seismic data with lower \n\ncosts, particularly after the 1980s, propelled the emergence of powerful \n\ninterpretation workstations, leaving behind hardware limitations to deal with large \n\ndatasets. Today, innovative commercial software for seismic interpretation and \n\nanalysis can run in ordinary personal computers and easily handle interpretation \n\ntasks for medium-large datasets. \n\n \n\nAvailable interpretation software tends to be easy-to-use providing several \n\nautomatic algorithms to help the geoscientist in the geophysical interpretation \n\nprocess. Automatic tools, when properly supervised by a user, execute a more \n\nconsistent seismic reflectors interpretation based not only in the visual continuity of \n\nthe reflector but also in its consistency in terms of amplitude. Interpreted well log \n\ndata and geological information are easily displayed and correlated with the \n\nseismic data and other geophysical datasets, reducing the number of mis-ties\n8\n and \n\nallowing the identification within the seismic data of known and important lithologic \n\nformations. In the seismic attributes domain (see Chapter IV), new software \n\nsolutions have large attributes libraries being able to compute and display them, \n\non-the-fly, even for large amounts of three-dimensional seismic data. \n\n \n\nThese combined factors introduced a new paradigm in seismic interpretation: the \n\npossibility of creating different geological models, in a faster and reliable way, \n\nwhich associated with the increase in quality of seismic data, led to optimized well \n\ndesign and location (Chopra and Marfurt, 2005).  \n\n \n\n                                            \n8\n When interpretation from the seismic data does not match well log data or when two seismic lines cross and \n\nthe interpreted seismic reflectors do no match. \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n34 \n\nThere are many seismic interpretation software but the three most used in the oil \n\nand gas industry are: SeisWorks, Kingdom Suite and Petrel.  \n\n \n\nSeisWorks is the Landmark UNIX based software suite solution for 2D and 3D \n\nseismic interpretation and analysis taking into account the existing geological data \n\n(www.halliburton.com).    \n\n \n\nThe Kindgom Suite software, developed by Seismic Micro-Technology, is a basic \n\nsoftware package to perform seismic interpretation, 2D and/or 3D, integrated with \n\ngeological and log data with the purpose of building a geological model with less \n\ntime consumption and reduced uncertainty (www.seismicmicro.com). \n\n  \n\nPetrel is mark of Schlumberger and is a unique \u201cSeismic-to-Simulation Software\u201d. \n\nIt enables the possibility of geologists, geophysicists and reservoir engineers to \n\nwork together as one, in the same work base. The last step in Petrel is creating a \n\ncompletely and fully detailed reservoir model: from the interpretation of seismic \n\ndata, through the integration of geological log data and testing of different \n\ngeological scenarios with the aim of modeling and simulating a hydrocarbon \n\nreservoir (Schlumberger, 2008). \n\n \n\nIII.1. Seismic \u2013 to \u2013 Simulation software, Petrel 2008.1 \n\n \n\nPetrel has been developed by Schlumberger since 1996 and many upgrades have \n\nbeen done from version to version in order to improve algorithms and give an \n\neffective response to the customers\u2019 needs. It unites geosciences and reservoir \n\nengineering domains to work together allowing to \u201cthink critically and in a creative \n\nway\u201d about the modeled hydrocarbon reservoir. Companies can increase profits by \n\nreducing the uncertainty and time consumption of data analysis, interpretation and \n\nmodeling, while experiencing the different Petrel modules (Figure 22; \n\nSchlumberger, 2008; www.slb.com (d)). \n\n \n\nGeophysical data can be interpreted, often with automatic picking, either in a 2D \n\nview or directly from a 3D display of the seismic volume. Automatic interpretation \n\n\n\nChapter III 3D Seismic Interpretation in Petrel \n\n35 \n\ntools are quality controlled, constrained and validated by a user supported by \n\npreviously computed seismic attributes and/or by other geological well log data. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 22 - Petrel 2008.1 module dependency map (modified from www.slb.com (d)). \n\n \n\nThe correlation between geological and geophysical domains can be done through \n\nsynthetic seismograms or by depth-time conversion using an adequate velocity \n\nmodel. With a validated structural geology model of the hydrocarbon reservoir, this \n\ncan be populated with facies and properties distributions based in geostatistic \n\nanalysis (www.slb.com (d)).  \n\n \n\nReservoir engineers can easily simulate reservoir flows by exporting the reservoir \n\nmodel to Eclipse\n9\n. The output results are imported back to Petrel where they can \n\nbe displayed and analyzed. Potential wells can be visually designed and used as a \n\nguide for successful real-time perforation. All of these data and results are \n\ninteractively displayed in proper windows within Petrel\u2019s user interface (see \n\nSection III.1.1; www.slb.com (d)). \n\n                                            \n9\n Eclipse is the reservoir simulation solution of Schlumberger. \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n36 \n\nIII.1.1. Petrel 2008.1 User Interface \n\n \n\nPetrel 2008.1 has a Windows based, user friendly, interface divided in different \n\ncustomized areas, as shown in the figure below. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 23 - Petrel 2008.1 user interface. \n\n \n\nThe display window allows the user to visualize different types of data, considered \n\nas objects. The different data are displayed in the correspondent type of window \n\n(Figure 24) depending on their type. Seismic data can be displayed in a 3D, 2D or \n\nin an interpretation window.  \n\n \n\nPetrel Exploration Pane I (PE-1; Figure 25a) contains all the data within the project \n\norganized in a tree structure. All data not related to a 3D grid is stored in the Input \n\npane, while data related to a 3D grid is located in the Models pane. The Results \n\npane stores the numerical results of volume calculations and simulation computed \n\nfrom the modeled reservoir. Petrel uses templates to display data and data \n\nproperties. Those templates, or colour scale bars, are saved inside the Template \n\npane catalogued in folders by type. More information about templates can be \n\nfound in the following section. \n\n\n\nChapter III 3D Seismic Interpretation in Petrel \n\n37 \n\n \n\nFigure 24 \u2013 Example of available windows in Petrel 2008.1. \n\n \n\nExploration Pane II (PE-2; Figure 25b) is located below PE-1 and contains the \n\nProcesses diagram pane, where all available processes are stored by the order \n\nthey should be performed to build a reservoir model. The Workflows pane is where \n\nworkflows, a sequence of pre-designated tasks created by the Process Manager \n\nare saved. The Cases pane is used when a volume calculation is performed. \n\nFinally, the Windows pane has information about all the opened windows within \n\nthe project. \n\n \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n \n\n(b) \n\nFigure 25 \u2013 (a) Petrel Exploration Pane I; (b) Petrel Exploration Pane II. \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n38 \n\n The Function bar is placed by default on the right side of the display window and \n\nis related to the Processes diagram pane. When a process is active (highlighted) \n\navailable tools to accomplish the process will be shown in Function bar. \n\n \n\nIII.1.2. Templates in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n \n\nThe way how Petrel displays objects and object properties is through templates \n\n(Figure 26a). Templates are defined as objects which contain information about \n\nthe colour table settings and the correspondent opacity curve common to groups \n\nof similar data.  \n\n \n\nEach template is by default already connected to a group of data and is organized \n\ninside the Templates pane by folders (Figure 26b). To display an object correctly, \n\nthe template can be visually tuned by to the user in two ways: by accessing \n\ntemplates properties through clicking the right mouse button (RMB) on a template, \n\nor by selecting the desired object and accessing its settings. In both cases it \n\nshould be kept in mind that templates are assigned to groups of similar data \n\nobjects. If a template is changed for one object, this modification will affect the \n\ndisplay of all the objects under the same template. To edit the template in a \n\nspecific object the user should click on the padlock, inside objects settings, (Figure \n\n26a, top) or make a copy of the template, edit it and assign it to the desired object \n\n(Schlumberger, 2008). \n\n \n\nThe user is free to create a totally new colour range scale, transform continuous \n\ntemplates into discrete ones and vice-versa. For example, constraining the \n\nmaximum and minimum values displayed or adjusting the colour scale range, can \n\nbe useful to enhance hidden features. This method is widely applied in seismic \n\nattributes analysis to withdraw the maximum information from the data. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter III 3D Seismic Interpretation in Petrel \n\n39 \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n \n\n(b) \n\nFigure 26 - (a) Colour scale bar and opacity curve inside templates properties. To change a \ntemplate for just one object, the padlock, on objects setting, should be activated. (b) Several \ntemplates, divided by folders, can be found under the Templates pane in PE-1. \n\n \n\nIII.1.3. Importing Seismic Data \n\n \n\nSeismic attributes, which are the main topic of this thesis, are computed from \n\npreviously loaded seismic data in Petrel. This section discusses how seismic data \n\nis imported into a project and what kind of seismic files formats are supported by \n\nPetrel 2008.1.  \n\n \n\nBoth 2D and 3D seismic data can be loaded into Petrel 2008.1, in standard SEG-Y \n\nformat or in ZGY (internal) bricked format.  \n\n \n\nSEG-Y is a standard binary format, created by the Society of Exploration \n\nGeophysicists (SEG) in 1973. This format was created with the purpose to \n\nbecome a standard between the seismic data from different oil companies which in \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n40 \n\nthe past used proprietary formats (Barry et al., 1975). Nowadays, most of the \n\nseismic data exchanged between oil companies is recorded in SEG-Y format \n\n(Gaillot jr., 1994). \n\n \n\nThe original SEG-Y format has a reel identification header which consists of 3600 \n\nbytes, divided into two parts: the EBCDIC header, with 3200 bytes, where \n\ninformation about the survey and about the acquisition parameters are recorded, \n\nand one Binary header with 400 bytes. Within these 400 bytes, 60 are assigned to \n\nseismic data information and the rest 340 bytes can be user-assigned to additional \n\ninformation. The rest of the SEG-Y file is filled with \u201cn\u201d Trace Data Blocks, \n\ncorresponding one for each recorded trace. 240-bytes are saved for each Trace \n\nheader, where information about the position of the trace is recorded. The rest is \n\nkept free to record the seismic signal. For detailed information about the SEG-Y \n\nformat it is suggested reading the \u201cSEG Technical Standards\u201d (Barry et al., 1975). \n\n \n\nSEG-Y files can be loaded into Petrel in two different ways. If the user is sure that \n\nthe data is saved in the right byte position according to the standard SEG-Y file \n\nformat, the seismic data should be loaded as \u201cSEG-Y seismic data\u201d. If the user is \n\nnot sure about how the data is organized, seismic data should be imported as \n\n\u201cSEG-Y import with present parameters\u201d. In this way the user can specify the \n\ncorrect byte location for each acquisition parameter. Byte locations within the file \n\ncan be checked in the \u201cSEGY headers from first file\u201d (Figure 27). \n\n \n\nWith the correct byte positions defined, before finishing the loading process, it is \n\npreferable to do a scan of the first \u201cn\u201d traces to quality control the imported data \n\n(Figure 28). This last step is very important and the final result should match the \n\nacquisition parameters such as inline/crossline relative positions and separation. \n\n \n\nZGY extension is a Petrel internal bricked format for 3D cubes or binary format for \n\n2D seismic data. In this format the seismic data is stored under bricks (instead of \n\nbeing stored in the traditional trace format) which allow big datasets to be easily \n\naccessed and manipulated. Big bricks with low resolution are loaded first into \n\nmemory, after which the program will start loading smaller bricks with higher \n\nresolution. Using this method, large volumes can be loaded and rendered in a 3D \n\n\n\nChapter III 3D Seismic Interpretation in Petrel \n\n41 \n\nview, allowing the user to interact with the data at any time, since the loading of \n\nsmaller bricks is stopped if the user moves the view (Schlumberger, 2007b). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 27 - Dialog box to import SEG-Y files in Petrel 2008.1. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 28 - Scan of the first 1000 traces to quality control the imported SEG-Y file. \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n42 \n\nIt is preferable to use ZGY format within Petrel rather than standard SEG-Y format, \n\nespecially for big datasets with high resolution. ZGY files can be exported into \n\nSEG-Y to be used in other applications. SEG-Y files can be internally converted in \n\nZGY files using the Realize function (see Section III.1.4).  \n\n \n\nIII.1.4. Realize Seismic Cube \n\n \n\nThe process within Petrel which allows the user to create a physical copy of a \n\nseismic volume or a 2D seismic line is called Realization. Realization is mainly \n\ndone for three purposes: (1) to allow the user to create a physical copy from virtual \n\nseismic data; (2) to permit to change data resolution; (3) to convert SEG-Y files \n\ninto ZGY format (Schlumberger, 2007b). \n\n \n\nCreating virtual cropped seismic data or seismic attributes cubes is a solution in \n\norder to save disk space and test different parameters without wasting time. Virtual \n\ndata is efficient to display 2D seismic lines or vertical seismic section of a seismic \n\ncube. In contrast, to perform quick slicing (on time) or to render a volume it is \n\nnecessary to use a physical copy of the data; this will increase the access time to \n\nthe data but will also create a new ZGY file, with large size, on the hard disk \n\n(Schlumberger, 2007b). \n\n \n\nPetrel also allows changing the seismic data from 32-bytes floating point to 16-\n\nbytes or 8-bytes, which represents, respectively, a file size smaller 50% or 70% \n\nthan the original. Changing the resolution is not critical for many operations; \n\nhowever, seismic data should always have 32-bytes resolution if it will be used in \n\nthe automatic interpretation processes. If lower resolution is chosen, the volume \n\nwill not have enough dynamic range\n10\n\n to perform a quality event tracking (Barnes, \n\n2000; Schlumberger, 2008). \n\n \n\n                                            \n10\n\n Dynamic Range is the ratio of the largest measurable amplitude to the smallest. It can be mathematically \ndefined as: 20*log10(A1/A2). \n\n\n\nChapter III 3D Seismic Interpretation in Petrel \n\n43 \n\nFinally, the last purpose is simply to create a ZGY file format from a SEG-Y file. \n\nThe advantages of using this kind of data in Petrel have already been discussed in \n\nthe previous section. \n\n \n\nTo access the realization operation the user has to choose the settings menu for \n\nthe respective seismic data object and select the Operations tab (Figure 29) \n\nfollowed by a click in \u201cSet from source as shown above\u201d and finally the \u201cScan\u201d \n\nbutton. This first sequence of steps will perform a scan of the values within the \n\ndata and display the result in one histogram. The Filter Bins option should then be \n\nselected to exclude the maximum spike, often related with null values, in the \n\nhistogram. Removing this effect has special importance when the realization \n\nprocess is being done for a seismic attribute volume (Schlumberger, 2007b). \n\n \n\nRealization can be very time-consuming and heavy, in terms of computation, and \n\nmay need a large amount of free disk space, although it runs in background \n\nallowing the user to continue using Petrel for other tasks. \n\n \n\nIt should be kept in mind that realization should always be done for large seismic \n\nvolumes for an easier manipulation and visualization. The output resolution will \n\ndepend on the purpose of the data. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 29 - Realization process dialog box. \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n44 \n\nIII.1.5. Computing Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n \n\nThere are two processes to compute seismic attributes in Petrel 2008.1 and they \n\ncan be found in PE-2, under the Processes pane inside the Geophysics family \n\n(Figure 30). The available seismic attributes are divided into volume and surface \n\nattributes. Each process has the available attributes organized by several libraries \n\n(Figure 31) which attempt to group attributes with similar outputs. \n\n  \n\nVolume attributes are those computed from an entire 3D seismic cube resulting in \n\na new seismic cube containing the attribute information. Surface attributes are the \n\nvalue of the computed attribute from a seismic cube in one surface, created from \n\nseismic interpretation, or in between two surfaces, or between a surface and a \n\nconstant time window.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 30 - Volume and Surface attributes processes that can be found under the processes pane, \nin PE-2. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter III 3D Seismic Interpretation in Petrel \n\n45 \n\nVolume attributes are divided into five libraries and within each library several \n\nattributes can be chosen in a total of 29 (Figure 31, left). Surface Attributes have \n\nan extensive list of 50 attributes which are categorized into four libraries \n\ndepending on how they are computed: Amplitude, Statistical, Signal Shape and \n\nMeasurable Interval (Figure 31, right). \n\n \n\nDepending on the algorithm for their calculations, seismic attributes may have, or \n\nnot, user-defined parameters which will be taken into account when the algorithm \n\nis applied, in order to achieve the desired output data with the best quality \n\npossible. In all user-defined parameters Petrel always suggests a value by default \n\nwhich in many cases is suitable for the expected result. \n\n \n\nApart from the catalogued attributes, a myriad of attributes can also be calculated \n\nwith Petrel\u2019s Seismic Calculator. This tool allows the user to create new versions \n\nof seismic cubes by user-defined formulas. The new attributes seismic cubes are \n\ngenerated based on already existing and realized cubes. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 31 - Volume attributes libraries (left) and Surface attributes libraries (right). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n\n \n\nChapter IV. Seismic Attributes in Petrel \n\n2008.1 \n\n \n\nThe use of seismic attributes has passed through periods of great proliferation and \n\nenthusiasm contrasting with moments of disuse and lost in credibility (Figure 32). \n\nThese oscillations are closely dependent on the technological development and \n\nwhat geophysicists think about them (Chopra and Marfurt, 2005). This chapter \n\nreflects how seismic attributes, in particular the available in Petrel 2008.1, are \n\nunderstood today. \n\n \n\nTo answer the needs of the exploration and production industry intensive studies \n\nin seismic attributes have been carried out, mainly due to their potential for \n\nhydrocarbon reservoir prediction, characterization and monitoring (Chen and \n\nSidney, 1997). Interpretation workflows for structural geology, stratigraphy analysis \n\nand rock/pore fluid properties based on attributes derived from processed seismic \n\ndata, are now daily routines in oil and gas companies (Chopra and Marfurt, 2005). \n\nRecent developments in multi-attributes analysis, combined with self-learning \n\nprocesses (e.g. artificial neural networks) can transform large amounts of data into \n\none single seismic volume with valuable geological information content (Cooper, \n\n2008), shortcutting the heavy interpretation process. \n\n \n\nPetrel 2008.1 provides a comprehensive package of both surface and volume \n\nseismic attributes that can be used in every stage of the hydrocarbon reservoir \n\nmodeling process to reduce uncertainty and complement the available data. In this \n\nchapter a small introduction to the most important available attributes in Petrel \n\n2008.1 is presented, followed by the application to a case study (Chapter V). The \n\ndetailed mathematical derivations of the methods are however beyond the scope \n\nof this work. \n\n \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n48 \n\nWhen possible, some best practice, to use in Petrel 2008.1, which combine more \n\nthan one attribute are proposed, in order to achieve a better final result. The order \n\nin which the attributes are presented in this thesis tries to combine them into \n\nfamilies, depending on the final result of each attribute. Therefore, attributes from \n\nthe same library with similar results will be introduced one after another with \n\nexamples from real data. \n\n \n\nThe described algorithms and theoretical background are based on \n\nSchlumberger\u2019s booklet Interpreter\u2019s Guide to Seismic Attributes (Schlumberger, \n\n2007a).  \n\n \n\nIV.1. Introduction to Seismic Attributes \n\n \n\nWith the proliferation of many seismic attributes it becomes a challenge to strictly \n\ndefine what seismic attributes are, when they should be applied and how to \n\nclassify them. These questions remain not totally answered, even for the many \n\nauthors who dedicated part of their work to solve the disordered situation in \n\nseismic attributes classification (e.g. Chen and Sidney, 1997; Taner, 2000; 2001). \n\nNowadays, a consensus has not yet been reached (Barnes 2001).  \n\n \n\nThe definition of seismic attributes given next is a blend of, more or less, accepted \n\nconcepts present first by Taner (1997; 2000; 2001), Barnes (2001), Chopra and \n\nMarfurt, (2005). An attribute, as the name indicates is an intrinsic quality of an \n\nobject or person (www.priberam.pt). Therefore in the geophysical context, \u201cseismic \n\nattributes\u201d are a way to describe and quantify a characteristic content of the \n\nseismic data. Quantified characteristics can be directly computed and/or measured \n\nfrom the original data or implied from logical or personal experiences of the user. \n\nAttributes are also the rate of change of any of these quantities with respect to \n\ntime or space, both from pre- and post-stack seismic data. In a nutshell, seismic \n\nattributes are new ways to look at the seismic data which conventionally is plotted \n\nin amplitudes (www-sst.unil.ch). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n49 \n\nSeismic attributes emerged to transform the subjective and experience based \n\ninterpretation process into something less tedious, and more objective. They try to \n\nmimic the interpreter\u2019s expertise, by automatically identifying and correlating \n\nseismic events with real geological features (Chopra and Marfurt, 2005). Today, \n\nseismic attributes are added values for structural, stratigraphic and texture \n\nanalysis, and in facies and hydrocarbon reservoir properties prediction, when \n\ncorrectly used by an expert user (e.g. Taner, 2001; Barnes, 2001; Sheline, 2005; \n\nChopra and Marfurt, 2005). Seismic attributes analyses are not a new concept in \n\nthe seismic world; in fact, attributes derived from seismic data are around since \n\nthe beginning of exploration seismology, in the 1950s (Chopra and Marfurt, 2005). \n\nSo, why was it just in the last few decades that attributes saw their importance \n\ngrow? Cooper (2008) attributes this late development to the traditional resistance \n\nin the oil and gas industry to the introduction of new concepts and methods.  \n\n \n\nThe enormous number of different seismic attributes has mainly proliferated since \n\nthe 1970s (Figure 32). This \u201cboom\u201d of attributes came about especially after the \n\nintroduction of coloured seismic sections by Balch (1971), following the work of \n\nTaner et al. (1979) on complex seismic trace analysis (see IV.3.2), and lastly by \n\nthe generalization of 3D seismic data and interpretation workstations (Barnes, \n\n2001; Chopra and Marfurt, 2005; Cooper, 2008).  \n\n \n\nNowadays, with the advances in seismic interpretation technology, seismic \n\nattributes analysis has became vulgarized, leading in some cases to the abuse \n\nand wrong use of this valuable tool (Sheline, 2005). The seismic interpreter should \n\nnot stop searching through the suite of available attributes in his interpretation \n\nworkstation after finding one attribute that shows the feature he wants to see. The \n\nuser should use one attribute for each property or feature of interest and combine \n\nthem through geostatistics or other multi-attribute analysis tool, to check the \n\ncorrelation between the different attributes (Chopra and Marfurt, 2005).  \n\n \n\nHistorically, attributes are divided depending from where they are derived, how \n\nsensitive they  are to the geological background of  the data  and if  they are  direct \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n50 \n\nhydrocarbon indicators (DHIs, e.g. a Bright Spot\n11\n\n; Chen and Sidney, 1997). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 32 \u2013 Time line of seismic attributes development (in italic) and their relation with advances \nin seismic exploration technology, from 1960 to the present. Key works are represented by their \nauthors\u2019 name (Modified from Barnes, 2001). \n\n \n\nAttributes with the most predictive results are those derived from the various \n\nseismic wavelet components. The amplitude content within the data effectively \n\nprovides physical parameters about the subsurface such as acoustic impedance, \n\nreflection coefficients, velocities and absorption effects which supply structural \n\ndetail or act as DHIs. Phase content is used to determine the shape and geometry \n\nof reflectors and it is an important attribute to improve seismic reflectors continuity \n\nand for the interpretation of seismic stratigraphy and depositional regimes (Taner, \n\n2001; Brown, 2001; Chopra and Marfurt, 2005). Frequency derived attributes are \n\nuseful in stratigraphic events, fault interpretation due to absorption effects, as \n\nDHIs, in forecast of reservoir properties, and when combined with amplitude-\n\nbased attributes, they may help in the interpretation of additional geologic layering \n\n(Brown, 2001). \n\n \n\n                                            \n11\n\n A bright spot is an amplitude anomaly within the seismic data that can indicate the presence of \nhydrocarbons. \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n51 \n\nA real implementation of multi-attribute analysis is the next step in the seismic \n\nattributes domain. With multi-attribute analysis, improved spatial coherence of \n\ndepositional events, such as ancient channels systems, is just the beginning of \n\nwhat can be reliably predicted (Cooper, 2008). The ultimate step, especially for \n\nareas where well log data is unavailable, is a real and effective estimation of facies \n\ndistribution and prediction of hydrocarbon reservoirs properties based mostly on \n\nseismic patterns recognition and correlation (Barnes, 2001; Chen and Sidney, \n\n1997). \n\n \n\nIn exploration seismology, seismic attributes can be considered a turning point in \n\nseismic interpretation. Seismic attributes allow obtaining accurate detailed \n\ninformation on structural, stratigraphic and lithological parameters of the seismic \n\nprospect (Taner, 2001) as an integrated solution (Cooper, 2008) for hydrocarbon \n\nreservoir identification, modeling and characterization with reduced uncertainty \n\n(Sheline, 2005). At the limit, the main issue is not the attributes themselves but \n\ntheir application, which should be carefully chosen. The desired geologic features \n\nto be enhanced should be first clearly defined by the interpreter. An attribute \n\nshould not be used just because it is available as a software tool. In multi-attribute \n\nanalysis, attributes should be first correlated to detect if different attributes will not \n\nenhance the same result. For instance, using too many attributes can generate \n\ngeostatiscal errors in hydrocarbon reservoir properties prediction (Sheline, 2005).   \n\n \n\nLastly, apart from a careful and adequate attribute choice, with the right user-\n\ndefined parameters, the associated colour scale range with which they will be \n\ndisplayed is also a very important aspect (see Section III.1.2). The quality of one \n\nattribute will be dependent not only on the quality of the original seismic data but \n\nalso in the colour scale bar used to display the attribute. The correct display allows \n\nthe human eye to detect and distinguish subtle changes which may be associated \n\nwith interesting features (Lynch and Lines, 2004). As a last concern, seismic \n\nattributes should not be applied as recipe, expecting the same result to be always \n\nachieved independently of the input data and the geological background. Indeed, it \n\nis necessary to first understand the data and realize first which features will be \n\npotentially enhanced by the seismic attribute. \n\n \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n52 \n\nIV.2. Classification of Seismic Attributes \n\n \n\nWith the increasing interest on seismic attributes and their large number and \n\ndiversity it now becomes necessary to catalogue them into different classes. Many \n\nproposals have been put forward with the aim of classify seismic attributes in a \n\ntight, strict and intuitive way, based on both the input and the expected result. \n\nUnfortunately, new attributes appear every day and algorithms of well known \n\nattributes can be improved since sometimes they give unexpected results. The \n\nproposed classifications are constantly changing, depending on the understanding \n\nof the seismic attribute today (Taner, 2000). \n\n \n\nTaner et al. (1994) were the first to introduce a coherent and real classification for \n\nseismic attributes. They created two general categories for seismic attributes: \n\ngeometrical and physical. Geometrical attributes enhance geometrical \n\ncharacteristics of the input data such as: dip, azimuth and continuity. Physical \n\nattributes are related to physical properties of the subsurface which are \n\ninextricably connected to the lithology. This family of attributes corresponds to \n\nattributes derived from amplitude, frequency and phase components of the trace. \n\nThese two categories can further be divided into prestack and poststack, \n\ndepending on the data processing step from which they have been computed.  \n\n \n\nBrown (2004), in Chopra and Marfurt (2005), proposed to classify attributes using \n\na tree structure with branches for time, amplitude, frequency and attenuation, with \n\neach branch being further divided in prestack and poststack attributes. Time \n\nattributes provide information about structural geology while amplitude attribute \n\ngive information on stratigraphy and reservoir properties.  \n\n \n\nThe Chen and Sidney (1997) classification divides attributes in two main groups: \n\none based on wave kinematic/dynamics, and the second group based on geologic \n\nreservoir features; further sub-divisions depend on where the attribute is extracted \n\nand on the expected output.   \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n53 \n\nMore recently, Chopra and Marfurt (2005) based on classifications from other \n\nauthors, proposed a new classification for seismic attributes. The classification \n\ndivides attributes into: general, specific and composite. General attributes \n\ncomprises seismic attributes which measure geometric, kinematic, dynamic or \n\nstatistical features derived from seismic data. They are related either to the \n\nphysical or morphological character of the data since they represent the response \n\nof a specific lithology. Therefore they can be generally applicable to different \n\ngeological environments with expected similar outputs. Specific attributes are less \n\ncorrelated to the lithological character of the input data and therefore cannot be \n\nextrapolated to similar geological environments, since their response is intrinsic of \n\nspecific hydrocarbon reservoir properties. Composite attributes include sums, \n\nproducts or other combinations of more fundamental general attributes. \n\n \n\nPetrel 2008.1 does not follow any of these classification schemes, as discussed \n\nbefore. It uses a new and more user-friendly classification for seismic attributes. \n\nAttributes are first divided into volume and surface attributes, depending on the \n\ninput data, and then into libraries (Figure 31). Each library groups attributes which \n\nwill enhance similar features. \n\n \n\nIV.3. Volume Attributes \n\n \n\nVolume attributes are computed from processed seismic cubes or from previously \n\ncomputed attribute volumes which are extracted, depending on the mathematical \n\nalgorithm, trace by trace or considering a group of traces (multi-traces). The \n\nextraction is performed over a user-defined fixed window, where two horizontal \n\ntime slices are defined as upper and lower boundaries. \n\n \n\nThe single-trace method is applied when the computation algorithm operates in \n\neach trace separately between a vertical fixed window. Attribute extraction is done \n\nwithin the user-defined window length in a random position, inside the seismic \n\nvolume. The extracted attribute is then saved in one time slice, which will be \n\nplaced in a central position inside the window interval. The final attribute volume is \n\nthe result from repeating the attribute extraction, with the same vertical range, for \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n54 \n\ndifferent times and spatial positions, and then stacking the resultant slices (Figure \n\n33a; Chen and Sidney, 1997). \n\n \n\nMulti-trace seismic attributes are also computed inside a fixed vertical window with \n\nuser-defined limits. In this case, besides the vertical range, the user has to define \n\na bound in the number of traces that will be used to the attribute extraction, \n\naccording to a mathematical algorithm. Like in the single-trace method, the output \n\nvolume is the result of stacking all the time slices were the attribute computation \n\nwas kept from each window position in space and time (Figure 33b; Chen and \n\nSidney, 1997). \n\n \n(a) \n\n \n(b) \n\nFigure 33 - Seismic attributes can be generated (a) trace by trace or (b) using a collection of multi-\ntraces. Blue and red squares represent the upper and lower time slice boundary respectively. \nTraces from where the attributes were extracted are represented in yellow and will be saved in a \ntime slice placed in a central position in the computation window (modified from Chen and Sidney, \n1997). \n\n \n\nIV.3.1. Seismic Signal Processing Library \n\n \n\nIn this section a generalized concept of attribute will be used following the \n\ndefinition used in Petrel software. As such, frequency filtering and amplitude \n\ncorrections are considered as seismic data attributes. \n\n \n\nPetrel\u2019s Seismic Signal Processing library includes attributes related to seismic \n\ndata processing and data display. Attributes within this library are computed \n\naccording to the chosen method on each seismic trace separately. \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n55 \n\nSeismic Signal Processing attributes execute small seismic processing steps to \n\nhelp the interpreter, who is not an expert in seismic signal theory, to improve data \n\nquality and consistency without the need to re-process the entire seismic data in a \n\nspecial processing software. Available seismic attributes permit the user to \n\nimprove data quality in certain areas of interest, resulting in enhanced data \n\ncoherency by modifying the gain in amplitudes, applying basic filtering and through \n\nperforming phase shifts on the data.  \n\n \n\nA total of eight seismic attributes are included in Seismic Signal Processing library. \n\nThree perform phase shifts to the data, useful to match different vintages of \n\nseismic data and to improve reflectors sharpness; three other are related to \n\nfiltering and amplitude tuning; the last two operate in the energy content of the \n\nseismic trace. \n\n \n\nIn all the theoretical description and when describing the mathematical algorithms \n\nwhich are used to extract each seismic attribute, the original seismic trace, also \n\ncalled original amplitude, will be from now on designated by f(t).  \n\n \n\nIV.3.1.1. First Derivative \n\n \n\nThe first derivative attribute is defined as the time rate change of the input trace, or  \n\nthe derivative of f(t) with time. \n\n Eq. (3) \n\nThe first derivative of a digitized seismic trace can be approximately calculated by: \n\n Eq. (4) \n\nVisually, applying the first derivative attribute to a collection of seismic traces is the \n\nsame as computing a phase shift of 90\u00ba for those traces.  As such, no user-defined \n\nparameter is required for this step. First derivative can, first, be useful to quality \n\ncheck the signal consistency, since positive or negative picks should produce zero \n\ncrossings, to improve reflector sharpness, match different versions of seismic data \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n56 \n\nand improve the correlation between seismic data and lithology-indicative well log \n\ndata (Zeng, 2005a; b). \n\n \n\nNowadays most of the seismic data is acquired, or processed, to have a constant \n\nnearly zero-phase wavelet (Figure 34), which historically is the best type of \n\nwavelet to use in seismic interpretation. Indeed a zero-phase wavelet resolves \n\nbetter the top and the bottom of a bed, separated from more than 1/4 of the \n\ndominant wavelength, for simple layered models (1/4 of the wavelength is \n\ntraditionally defined as the maximum value for seismic vertical resolution). \n\n \n\nIf a 90\u00ba-phase wavelet, shifted from nearly zero-phase seismic data (Figure 34), is \n\nused, the vertical resolution increases with a decrease in thin-bed interference. In \n\naddition, the output volume will have significantly improvements for lithologic, \n\nstratigraphic and depositional facies interpretation. Thin layers analysis also \n\nbecome easier because reflectors have increased consistency and sharpness, \n\nleading to a better amplitude-lithology correlation (Zeng, 2005a; b). \n\n \n\nThis method is also effective in thin-bed hydrocarbon reservoirs, which most times \n\nare unresolved in zero-phase data, since the fluid anomaly signal is better \n\ndetected with stronger amplitude and higher stratigraphic resolution; although the \n\noriginal seismic data should have a high signal-to-noise ratio and an original \n\nwavelet with small side lobes (Zeng, 2005b). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 34 - Zero-phase wavelet (on the left) and 90\no\n-phase wavelet (on the right). Both wavelets \n\nare with SEG polarity inverted, black is positive amplitude (modified from Zeng, 2005a). \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n57 \n\nVisually, comparing 90\u00ba-phase (Figure 35b) with nearly zero-phase seismic data \n\n(Figure 35a), an increased vertical resolution and sharpness of seismic reflectors \n\ncan be observed, which are two pre-requisites for thin-bed interpretation. The use \n\nof first derivate attribute volumes, calculated from a zero-phase seismic data, has \n\nproven improved interpretability and can be used as seismic conditioning for \n\nautomatic picking tools in seismic reflector interpretation, working as an added \n\nvalue to reduce interpretation time-consumption.  \n\n \n\nTypically the correlation between the seismic and well log data is poor due to the \n\ndifferent nature of these two techniques. Well log data is acquired with high \n\nfrequency sources while seismic data is normally acquired with low frequency\n12\n\n. \n\nSeismic data processed to have a 90\u00ba-phase wavelet better mimics the acoustic \n\nlog signal, increasing the correlation between the seismic data and lithology-\n\nindicative well log data, particularly for acoustic impedance and porosity logs \n\n(Figure 36; Zeng, 2005b). \n\n \n\n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 35 \u2013 (a) Original seismic line and correspondent (b) first derivative attribute. The first \nderivative attribute data shows higher vertical resolution, with enhanced reflectors continuity and \nsharpness. Peaks in amplitude will produce zero crossings in the extracted attribute. \n\n \n\nComputing the first derivative attribute twice will produce the same effect as \n\nexecuting the second derivative attribute or, i.e. a 180\u00ba\n \nphase shift. Another point \n\nof interest when applying a first derivative, which will be further discussed in \n\n                                            \n12\n\n Low frequency will produce more penetration and less vertical resolution while high frequencies result in \nless penetration but higher vertical resolution. \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n58 \n\nSection IV.3.2, is that Petrel 2008.1 uses the same algorithm to calculate the \n\nHilbert Transform, for complex seismic trace analysis. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 36 - Porosity log (DPHI)\n13\n\n superimposed with nearly zero-phase seismic data, on the left, \nand superimposed with 90\u00ba-phase wavelet (on the right). A generalized better match between \nseismic data and well log data is achieved when a 90\u00ba-phase seismic data is used. \n\n \n\nIV.3.1.2. Second Derivative  \n\n \n\nMathematically this attribute is defined as the second time derivative of the original \n\nseismic trace. Similar to the calculation of the first derivative, Petrel uses an \n\napproximation algorithm to extract this attribute from the original seismic data, \n\nEquation 6.  \n\n Eq. (5) \n\n                                            \n13\n\n DPHI is a density porosity well log data used to estimate the porosity from a formation density \nmeasurement. \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n59 \n\n Eq. (6) \n\n \n\nSimilarly to the first derivate, where a 90\u00ba-phase shift of the seismic data is \n\ncalculated, the second derivative attribute performs a 180\u00ba-phase shift. Visually, \n\nthe output volume attribute will have traces with inverted polarity; peaks will \n\nbecome troughs and troughs become peaks (Figure 37). As such, this attribute \n\ncan be used to match seismic data from the same area which that has been \n\nrecorded with inverted polarities. Another potentiality of this attribute is to check \n\nthe consistency of the signal. Computing the second derivative twice to the same \n\ncollection of traces should result in an output cube with the same polarity and \n\nconsistency as the original seismic data. \n\n \n\n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 37 \u2013 (a) Original seismic data and (b) computed second derivative attribute. The attribute \nshows inverted polarity when compared to the original seismic section. Seismic data is displayed in \nvariable density superimposed by wiggle variable area display. \n\n \n\nSecond derivative also improves reflectors continuity and sharpness in areas \n\nwhere reflections are poorly resolved on the raw amplitudes (Figure 38). However, \n\nthe interpreter should be cautious as lateral amplitude variations will be \n\ndiminished, which difficult applying automatic picking tools to interpret regional \n\nevents. \n\n \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n60 \n\n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 38 \u2013 (a) Original seismic data and (b) extracted second derivative attribute. Orange arrows \nshow enhanced reflectors continuity for a small area. On the other hand at a larger scale seismic \nreflectores become more blury. \n\n \n\nIV.3.1.3. Phase Shift (Phase Rotation) \n\n \n\nThe phase shift attribute is a user-defined variable phase rotation (or shift) of the \n\noriginal seismic trace in the frequency domain. \n\n \n\nThis attribute is mainly used to match different vintages of seismic data which \n\nhave been recorded in different phases. As described before, performing a 90\no\n-\n\nphase shift is the same as computing the first derivative attribute (see Section \n\nIV.3.1.1), and choosing an angle of 180\no\n is the same as generating the second \n\nderivative attribute (see IV.3.1.2). \n\n \n\nIV.3.1.4. Graphic Equalizer \n\n \n\nThe graphic equalizer attribute is as a user-defined frequency band-pass filter that \n\ncan be applied to attenuate or enhance specific frequencies, or interval of \n\nfrequencies, in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and the reflectors \n\ncontinuity. \n\n \n\nIn Petrel this filtering is executed in the frequency domain by Equation 7.  \n\n Eq. (7) \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n61 \n\nWhere W(?) is a linearly interpolated frequency sampled weighting function based \n\non user-defined settings. In Equation 7 the frequency signal is represented by its \n\ncoefficients expressed as magnitude and phase angle (?).  is the radian \n\nfrequency. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 39 - Graphic equalizer attribute sliding control in Petrel. Toggling High-band on, the \nfrequency range is extended to 250 Hz. The figure shows the parameters used to compute the \noutput result shown in Figure 40. \n\n \n\nThis weighting function is created interactively in Petrel by sliding a control for \n\neach tenth frequency on graphic equalizer attribute dialog box (Figure 39). The \n\nslider position will attenuate, boost or leave the frequencies as they are originally. \n\nIf the slider is over a value between 0 and 1, frequencies will be attenuated; if the \n\nslider is over a value between 1 and 2 the selected frequency will be boosted; at \n\nzero, frequencies will be deleted. \n\n \n\nSeismic data is usually processed all-in-one with the same processing flow, which \n\nsometimes leads to areas less resolved then others. Some of these poorly \n\nresolved areas can have interesting features for the interpretation process. The \n\ngraphic equalizer attribute allows the interpreter to filter out some frequencies, \n\nincreasing the signal-to-noise ratio and improving data quality within those areas. \n\nSeveral band-pass filters with different parameters can easily be created almost \n\non-the-fly, in Petrel, and combined in the interpretation process to show different \n\naspects of the same data.  \n\n \n\nFigure 40 shows an example in which the graphic equalizer has been tested. The \n\noutput seismic section has enhanced reflectors continuity solving ambiguous \n\nsituations in the interpretation process. \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n62 \n\n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 40 \u2013 (a) Original seismic data and (b) graphic equalizer attribute, computed with settings \nfrom Figure 39. Orange arrows point to unresolved seismic reflectors which are better identified \nafter band-pass filtering. Black box is shown in Figure 41.  \n\n \n\nHighlighting reflectors that are consistent at different frequencies is the proposed \n\nworkflow to solve ambiguous situations in seismic reflectors terminations (Figure \n\n41).  \n\n \n\nIn a nutshell, the graphic equalizer attribute is an extremely useful attribute in \n\nPetrel 2008.1. It applies different band-pass filters with user-defined frequencies, \n\non-the-fly, allowing the user to test different filtered frequency intervals in order to \n\nadjust the data to his needs.  \n\n(a) \n\n \n\n(b) \n\nFigure 41 \u2013 (a) Seismic section with graphic equalizer attribute computed as a high-pass filter, with \nthe settings shown in (b), for the same area shown inside the rectangle of Figure 40b. There is an \neffective enhancement of seismic reflectors termination. \n\n \n\n? \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n63 \n\nIV.3.1.5. Time Gain \n\n \n\nDuring the propagation of the seismic energy inside the Earth its amplitude is \n\nattenuated with time. Sometimes errors during the seismic acquisition can origin \n\ntime dependent variation in the seismic amplitudes. These effects are normally \n\ncompensated with the introduction of a spherical divergence correction in the \n\nseismic processing stage. The time gain attribute is applied when specific time-\n\ndependent corrections are necessary for interpretation.Mathematically the balance \n\nof amplitudes with time is computed by the following equation, where ? is a user-\n\ndefined parameter:  \n\n Eq. (8) \n\nValues of ? bigger than one will produce an increase of amplitudes with time while \n\nvalues of ? smaller than one will produce a decrease of amplitudes with time \n\n(Figure 42). \n\n \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n \n\n(b) \n\nFigure 42 \u2013 Seismic sections comparing (a) the original seismic section with (b) time gain attribute \nin. Time gain was computed with ? equal to 5. The amplitude gain was increased as function of \ntime and amplitudes below the -1800 ms are boosted, relative to the shallower reflections. \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n64 \n\nIV.3.1.6. Trace AGC \n\n \n\nTrace AGC attribute applies the traditional Automatic Gain Control (AGC), which \n\nwas intensively used in the past and directly recorded during the acquisition of \n\nseismic data or applied during processing. AGC aims to provide mild amplitudes to \n\nall the data, reducing the signal amplitude where it is too strong or increasing it \n\nwhen it is weak (en.wikipedia.org (a)). \n\n \n\nThe use of AGC should be cautious in particular if the data is too noisy, because \n\namplitudes related to the noise content will also be boosted in order to match the \n\nlarger amplitudes of the signal. To minimize this effect, it is more adequate to use \n\na seismic volume previously filtered (e.g. a structurally smoothed attribute volume; \n\nsee IV.3.3.4) as an input to compute the Trace AGC attribute. This practice \n\nproduces most of times a good result. \n\n \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n \n\n(b) \n\nFigure 43 \u2013 (a) Seismic section in original amplitudes, and (b) respective trace AGC output \ncomputed within a window of size 9. Orange arrows show reflectors with improved coherency in \n(b), A general boost of amplitudes is also achieved throughout all seismic section. \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n65 \n\nPetrel 2008.1 computes trace AGC by balancing the RMS\n14\n\n level on a moving \n\nwindow with a user-defined length. Mathematically speaking, the trace AGC is \n\ncalculated as: \n\n \n\n Eq. (9) \n\nWhere Smax is defined as the maximum amplitude value of the entire survey. The \n\ncorrespondent output data are the amplitude values, scaled with the RMS \n\namplitude over a fixed-size window. \n\n \n\nThe trace AGC output attribute volume often shows improvements in the \n\ncoherency and continuity of seismic reflectors especially for areas with weak \n\nseismic events (Figure 43). \n\n \n\nIV.3.1.7. Trace Gradient \n\n \n\nThe trace gradient attribute computes the gradient along a trace between \n\nconsecutive samples. \n\n \nEq. (10) \n\n \n\nWhere K is the user-defined number of samples. \n\n \n\nHigh values of trace gradient are related with consecutive points having great \n\nchanges in amplitudes. This attribute is useful to distinguish between seismic units \n\nand can be correlated with areas with abrupt changes in lithologies, related to \n\ndifferences in acoustic impedance (Figure 44b). \n\n \n\nDisplaying together the original seismic data (Figure 44a) superimposed with trace \n\ngradient attribute (Figure 44c), with an adjusted transparency curve (on the lower \n\nleft corner of Figure 44c), produces a sensation of relief of the seismic events. This \n\neffect is the same which is experienced when seismic data is displayed with \n\nPetrel\u2019s \u201cbump illumination\u201d option activated (Schlumberger, 2007b). \n\n                                            \n14\n\n RMS Amplitude is defined as the \u201cRoot Mean Square\u201d of amplitude.

The opacity curve \nused to blend the two attributes is on the lower left corner of (c). Trace Gradient is displayed by \ndefault in a black-grey-white scale where white represents the maximum value and black the \nlowest value. \n\n \n\nIV.3.1.8. RMS Amplitude \n\n \n\n\u201cRoot Mean Square\u201d (RMS) amplitude is perhaps the most known attribute in the \n\nseismic world and by definition it is the \u201croot mean square\u201d of the original seismic \n\ntrace amplitude. The RMS amplitude (ARMS) attribute is extracted from the seismic \n\ntrace within a user-defined moving window with a width of N samples (Equation \n\n11). This attribute gives information about the energy content of the seismic data.  \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n67 \n\n Eq. (11) \n\nTypically, attributes related to the energy content of the seismic trace are used to \n\ndistinguish different kinds of lithologies (Figure 45). High values of RMS \n\namplitudes are commonly related to high porosity lithologies, such as porous \n\nsands, which are potential high quality hydrocarbon reservoirs.  \n\n \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n \n\n(b) \n\nFigure 45 \u2013 (a) Seismic section displaying original seismic data and (b) extracted RMS amplitude. \nBased on the energy content of the seismic data, different packages of lithologies are more easily \ndifferentiated. The vertical interval bounded by the two green lines corresponds to a deep-sea \nchannel complex.  \n\n \n\nIn oil and gas industry, RMS amplitudes are traditionally computed as a surface \n\nattribute or in strata slices (Zeng et al. 1998) to build attribute maps. Computing \n\nthe RMS amplitude attribute for an entire seismic cube enables the user to look at \n\nthe data in a different perspective. Rendering a RMS volume attribute where only \n\nhigh values are displayed as in Figure 46, for example,  can be used to interpret \n\nancient channels systems and in the recognition of bright spots. \n\n \n\nThe size of the window where the attribute is extracted is a key factor in RMS \n\namplitude attribute. Small size windows will show local geologic effects and not the \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n68 \n\ndesired effect of anomalies with high values of RMS amplitude; large size windows \n\nwill integrate energy from different sources and anomalies will not be \n\ndistinguished. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 46 \u2013 High RMS amplitudes in the whole 3D seismic cube viewed from above (all RMS \namplitudes below a certain threshold \u2013 see inset in figure \u2013 were hidden). High amplitudes (in \nyellow) define a complex of ancient meandering channels (between the two red dashed lines). \nSand channels are traditionally high quality hydrocarbon reservoirs. The opacity curve used in this \ndisplay is also shown on the right side of the figure. \n\n \n\nIV.3.1.9. Reflection Intensity \n\n \n\nThe last attribute included in this library (Seismic Processing Attribute\u2019s library) is \n\nalso related to the energy content of the seismic trace and is called reflection \n\nintensity (ARI). The reflection intensity attribute is defined as the average amplitude \n\nover a user-defined moving window of N values multiplied by the sample interval \n\n(often assumed as 1). This attribute is similar to envelope attribute (see IV.3.2.2) \n\nbut only considers the real part of the seismic trace. \n\n Eq. (12) \n\nThis attribute is useful for the delineation of amplitude features while retaining the \n\nfrequency content of the original trace (Figure 47). This reflection intensity attribute \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n69 \n\ncan be used to distinguish different type of lithologies, and/or events that have the \n\nsame amplitude but different frequency components. Conjugated with the \n\nenvelope, it forms a valuable tool for AVO\n15\n\n analysis. \n\n \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n \n\n(b) \n\nFigure 47 \u2013 (a) Original seismic plot; (b) Reflection Intensity (RI) seismic attribute. Differences in \nlithologies can be deduced by the differences in the value of RI and the frequency content of the \ndata. \n\n \n\nIV.3.2. Complex Trace Attribute Library \n\n \n\nSeismic attributes found under the Complex Trace Attributes library mainly result \n\nfrom the work done by Taner et al. (1979). These authors demonstrated the \n\nbenefit of thinking about the conventional seismic trace as an analytical signal \n\nhaving both real and imaginary parts, where the real part is the conventional \n\nseismic trace and the imaginary part can be calculated from the real part \n\n(Bracewell, 1978; Taner et al., 1979; Schlumberger, 2007a).  \n\n                                            \n15\n\n Amplitude Variation with Offset (AVO) is technique widely used in the oil and gas industry to detect fluid \ncontent in the rocks from the analysis of 3D seismic data. \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n70 \n\nVisually, plotting the entire complex seismic trace (FHI (t)), in the complex plane, \n\ncan be thought as a vector with variable length, that is continually rotating along \n\nthe time axis, tracing out an irregular helix (Figure 48). Both components of the \n\ncomplex seismic trace (real and imaginary), when plotted individually on the real \n\nand imaginary planes, respectively, have the same configuration with a shift of 90\u00ba \n\n(Taner et al, 1979). \n\n \n\nFigure 48 - Isometric diagram showing a complex seismic trace having both real and imaginary \npart. The real and the imaginary part of the seismic trace have a 90\u00ba-shift between them (Taner et \nal., 1979). \n\n \n\nUsing Fourier transforms there are fully implemented processes to interpret and \n\nanalyze seismic data in both time and frequency domain. Fourier analysis allows \n\nthinking about average properties of a large portion of the seismic trace; \n\nalternatively, complex trace analysis permits the user to think locally since this \n\ntransform technique retains the local significance of the seismic data (Taner et al. \n\n1979). \n\n \n\nMathematically the analytical signal, or complex seismic trace, FHI(t) is given by: \n\n Eq. (13) \n\nf(t) is the real part of the analytical seismic trace, or the conventional seismic trace, \n\nand f*(t) represents the imaginary (or quadrature) component of the seismic trace. \n\nf*(t) is calculated through H{f(t)}, the Hilbert Transform, Equation 14. This operator, \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n71 \n\nwhen applied to a complex analytical signal, introduces a phase shift of \u2013?/2 for \n\neach positive frequency and +?/2 for each negative frequency. \n\n Eq. (14) \n\nWhere PV the Cauchy Principal Value, which allows the integration in the \n\npresence of singularities (in this case for ?=t). \n\n \n\nThe seismic signal is normally expressed in terms of time-dependent amplitude \n\nA(t), and time-dependent phase ?(t). The real part, f(t), can be considered as a \n\ncosine function (Equation 15); therefore, since the real and the imaginary parts are \n\nshifted 90\u00ba, the correspondent complex component,  f*(t), is a sine function \n\n(Equation 16).  \n\n \n\n \nEq. (15) \n\n Eq. (16) \n\nThe complex seismic trace, FHI(t), can then be defined by: \n\n Eq. (17) \n\nComplex seismic traces are normally defined in a Cartesian system. However this \n\nresults in difficult and complex calculations, leading to non reliable results. Euler\u2019s \n\nmethod is an alternative to overcome the calculation complexities. Equation 17 \n\ncan be expressed using Euler\u2019s formula, by:   \n\n Eq. (18) \n\nFollowing Euler\u2019s relationships (Figure 49), using known values of f(t) and f*(t), two \n\nattributes (or measurements) can be directly extracted from complex trace \n\nanalysis; Reflection Strength, or envelope (Section IV.3.2.2), which is the modulus \n\nof the entire complex trace (Equation 19) and instantaneous phase (Section \n\nIV.3.2.3), which is the argument of a complex signal, Equation 20. \n\n Eq. (19) \n\n Eq. (20) \n\nThe Instantaneous frequency (IV.3.2.5) attribute can be derived from the phase \n\ninformation using: \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n72 \n\n \nEq. (21) \n\n \n\nComplex seismic trace analysis enables a natural separation between the \n\namplitude and the phase content of the seismic data, from which instantaneous \n\ncomplex attributes are generated. This new insight in seismic interpretation \n\nprovides additional information, from a usually \u201chidden\u201d component of the seismic \n\ndata (Taner et al. 1979).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 49 \u2013 Graphical representation of Euler\u2019s relationships. \n\n \n\nIn complex trace attributes analysis, the interpreted features have to be consistent \n\nin the various components of the analytical seismic trace: amplitude, energy \n\n(envelope), frequency (instantaneous frequency), and phase (instantaneous \n\nphase). Complex attributes, more than any other seismic attributes have to be \n\ndisplayed with a proper colour scale range (Taner et al. 1979). \n\n \n\nComplex seismic attributes are instantaneous attributes computed trace-by-trace.  \n\n \n\nIV.3.2.1. Apparent Polarity \n\n \n\nApparent polarity is the sign of f(t), the real part of the complex trace, at a local \n\nmaximum of the envelope (see Section IV.3.2.2; Figure 50), over a window with a \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n73 \n\nuser-defined length. Depending on the sign of f(t) at the local maximum of the \n\nenvelope, a colour is assigned, traditionally blue for negative values and red for \n\npositive. Variations on the value of the envelope will produce a gradation between \n\nblue and red.  \n\n \n\nTheoretically, the polarity of the seismic trace reveals the sign of the reflection \n\ncoefficient whenever the received signal is from a single reflection of a zero-phase \n\nwavelet. However, most reflection events correspond to more than one single \n\nreflection; this will reduce the correlation between the signal of the reflection \n\ncoefficient and the wave polarity. Due to this non-correlation effect, this attribute \n\nwas created (Taner et al., 1979).  \n\n \n\nThe apparent polarity attribute is particularly used to enhance event continuity, \n\nimproving seismic reflectors interpretation through automatic tools. Lateral \n\nvariations of apparent polarity along a reflector may indicate lateral variations in \n\nlithology (Figure 51). Thick beds can be easier detected with apparent polarity \n\ninterpretation since the data is not affected by waveform effects. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 50 \u2013 Schematic representation of how apparent polarity is computed and its relationship \nwith the original seismic trace and the envelope attribute (Schlumberger, 2007a). \n\n \n\nThis attribute is highly effective for quality seismic data with little noise content. For \n\ndata with considerable noise, and using Petrel 2008.1, it is suggested to compute \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n74 \n\napparent polarity from a structural smoothing (see IV.3.3.4) seismic cube, where \n\nthe spatial noise is reduced to the minimum. \n\n \n\n(a) \n \n\n(b) \n\nFigure 51 \u2013 (a) Seismic section with original amplitude and (b) extracted apparent polarity \nattribute. Apparent polarity enhances reflectors\u2019 continuity and lateral changes of lithology. \nApparent polarity volumes are good for input into automatically picking interpretation tools. \n\n \n\nWhen displayed with envelope and instantaneous frequency attributes apparent \n\npolarity can be used to distinguish different kinds of bright spots. Bright spots \n\nassociated with gas accumulations generally show negative polarity, while positive \n\npolarity often appears associated to gas-oil and gas-water interface (Taner et al. \n\n1979). \n\n \n\nIV.3.2.2. Envelope (Reflection Strength) \n\n \n\nThe envelope attribute, or Reflection Strength as designated by Taner et al. \n\n(1979), was probably the first attribute calculated with Complex Trace Analysis. It \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n75 \n\nis defined as the total instantaneous energy of the entire analytical trace, both real \n\nand imaginary parts (Figure 52). In other words, the envelope is the modulus of \n\nthe analytical seismic trace, computed following the Equation 19 over a user-\n\ndefined window. \n\n \n\nEnvelope is a phase-independent attribute. This means that maximum values of \n\nthe envelope may not be at the same position of maximum peaks, or troughs, \n\nwhen compared with the input seismic data (Taner et al., 1979). The envelope \n\nattribute can be used to compare different seismic vintages, with different phases, \n\nsince both should have the peak energy always aligned.   \n\n \n\nAs an attribute related to the energy content of the seismic trace, it is useful to \n\ndetect major and subtle lithological changes that may be difficult to interpret from \n\nthe original seismic input. High values of the envelope can appear due to major \n\nlithological changes and sedimentary sequences boundaries as well as related to \n\nbright spots caused by gas accumulations. Gradual lateral changes of envelope \n\nvalues are often correlated with lateral variations in lithologies (Taner et., 1979). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 52 \u2013 Schematic representation of how envelope attribute is computed and its relationship \nwith the real seismic trace and the imaginary seismic trace (Schlumberger 2007a). \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n76 \n\n \n(a) \n\n \n(b) \n\nFigure 53 \u2013 (a) Original seismic section and (b) correspondent envelope attribute. Major and subtle \nlithologic changes are enhanced by the envelope attribute when compared to the original seismic \nsection. Rather than for interpreting individual reflectors, the envelope is be used to identify related \nseismic units through their energy content.  \n\n \n\nInterpretation of thin-beds, especially those inside a hydrocarbon reservoir, can be \n\nvery difficult in original amplitudes due to interference effects. Using the envelope \n\nattribute with the right parameters, calibrated to the formation thickness, can help \n\nto distinguish features which are not always detectable, by their energy content.  \n\n \n\nIV.3.2.3. Instantaneous Phase \n\n \n\nThe instantaneous phase attribute is computed from the argument of the complex \n\nseismic trace (?) Equation (20) in a user-defined window.  \n\n \n\nInstantaneous phase enhances both weak and strong seismic events due to the \n\ninvariant nature of the attribute in terms of amplitudes. This attribute has proven \n\nresults enhancing reflectors continuity, discontinuities, faults and pinch-outs. \n\nSeismic stratigraphy patterns (e.g. onlaps and offlaps) are easily identified with \n\nthis attribute allowing the interpreter to deduce more easily the sedimentary \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n77 \n\nprocesses that affected the area (Taner et al., 1979). Thin-bed hydrocarbon \n\nreservoirs often cause local phasing due to the presence of hydrocarbon \n\naccumulations, which explains classifying instantaneous phase as a DHI, a \n\npotential Direct Hydrocarbon Indicator (Chen et al., 1997).  \n\n \n\nThe proper display for instantaneous phase should take into account that phase \n\nvaries between -180\u00ba to 180\u00ba. The associated template should therefore consider \n\na circular colour scale bar where the two extreme angles should have the same \n\ncolour, since they correspond to the same phase angle (Figure 54). \n\n \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n \n\n(b) \n\nFigure 54 - (a) Seismic section displayed in original amplitude and (b) corresponding \ninstantaneous phase attribute where reflectors have enhanced continuity. Faults and seismic \nstratigraphy patterns (reflectors terminations) are better interpreted. \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n78 \n\nIV.3.2.4. Cosine of Instantaneous Phase \n\n \n\nThe Cosine of instantaneous phase, or normalized amplitude, is the cosine of the \n\ninstantaneous phase angle (?; see Section IV.3.2.3). Amplitude peaks and troughs \n\nwill remain at the same position but strong and weak events will exhibit equal \n\nstrength (Partika, 2000). It should be displayed with a colour scale range between \n\n-1.0, in black, and 1.0, in white.  \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nFigure 55 \u2013 (a) Original seismic section and (b) extracted cosine of instantaneous phase. The \ngreen line represents a seismic reflector interpretation using Petrel\u2019s \u201cSeeded 2D Autotracking\u201d \ntool. It is clearly that in (b) the interpretation is more consistent in space and close to what should \nbe a manual interpretation. \n\n \n\nThe cosine of instantaneous phase improves reflectors\u2019 continuity and enhances \n\nthe visual appearance of edges, such as faults and stratigraphic boundaries.  It is \n\nan indicative attribute about stratigraphic terminations, lateral variations and \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n79 \n\nseismic facies variations. Due to the improved reflectors continuity it is an \n\nexcellent attribute to constrain automatic interpretation tools (Figure 55) since \n\npoorly resolved seismic reflectors, which often lead to missinterpretations, become \n\nmore consistent. \n\n \n\nThe stratigraphic analysis and seismic pattern recognition is one of the hardest \n\ntasks to the interpreter but also one of the most important to infer the depositional \n\nregime which affected a sedimentary basin. Stratigraphic analysis is often based \n\non interpretation of reflectors terminations, which are more easily identified with \n\ncosine of instantaneous phase volume (Figure 56). \n\n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 56 \u2013 Seismic stratigraphic analysis becomes easier with the cosine of instantaneous phase \nattribute. (a) Green lines are interpreted reflectors which are being truncated by the red one. (b) \nShows a typical turbidite system feature, the \u201cseagull wing\u201d, corresponding to flood events of the \ninterpreted channel. \n\n \n\nIV.3.2.5. Instantaneous Frequency \n\n \n\nInstantaneous frequency is described as the rate of change in time of \n\ninstantaneous phase (Equation 21) over a user-defined window. It is an attribute \n\nindependent of amplitude and phase information and represents the instantaneous \n\ncentered frequency, or mean frequency of the frequency spectrum (Taner et al., \n\n1979). \n\n \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n80 \n\nNegative values of instantaneous frequency are related to phase angle reversals, \n\nwhich automatically are transformed into zero values, by the algorithm which \n\ncomputes this attribute in Petrel 2008.1 (Schlumberger, 2007a). \n\n \n\nMost of the recorded reflections in seismic data are not produced from a single \n\ngeological reflection but they are the sum of reflections from closely spaced \n\nreflectors. These closely spaced reflectors have little differences in acoustic \n\nimpedance between themselves and then the superimposition of individual \n\nreflections produce a frequency pattern which characterizes the composite \n\nreflection. Lateral and vertical variations in lithology can be identified by the \n\nchange of the composite pattern (Taner et al. 1979, Chen et al. 1997).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 57 \u2013 Time slice of an instantaneous frequency cube. In the central part, an E-W channel \nwhich extends to the right part of the figure is clearly distinguished, by constant values of \ninstantaneous frequency. Part of a salt body orientated NW-SE can also be identified in the lower \nleft corner. \n\n \n\nInstantaneous frequency is typically used to enhance vertical and lateral variations \n\nof lithologies. Channels are easier to identify in instantaneous frequency time \n\nslices because this attribute tends to be constant in value inside the potential \n\nhydrocarbon reservoir when compared to the surrounding environment (Figure \n\n57). This effect happens when there are no major lithological variations inside the \n\nchannel, contrasting to the abrupt lithological variations outside the channel \n\nborders. This method is also useful to detect fracture zones and as a Direct \n\nHydrocarbon Indicator (DHI). Faults and fractures also often cause absorption \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n81 \n\neffects causing low values of instantaneous frequency, just like salt bodies (Figure \n\n58). Sands with gas or oil content within the pores also usually cause drop-off high \n\nfrequencies just below the hydrocarbon reservoir \u2013 this effect is frequently called \n\n\u201clow-frequency shadow\u201d (Taner et al., 1979; Chen and Sidney, 1997).  \n\n \n\nTo correctly interpret Instantaneous Fequency attribute volumes the colour scale \n\nrange to display this attribute should be adjusted from zero to a maximum value \n\nclose to 65 Hz, depending on frequency component of the seismic data.  \n\n \n\n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 58 \u2013 (a) Seismic sections with original amplitude and (b) extracted instantaneous frequency \nattribute. Instantaneous frequency enhances faults and better delineates salt bodies, due to the \ncharacteristic low values of instantaneous frequency. Colour scale bar is shown in the lower left \ncorner of (b). \n\n \n\nIV.3.2.6. Instantaneous Bandwidth \n\n \n\nInstantaneous bandwidth, expressed in Hertz, by Equation 22, is mathematically \n\ndescribed as the absolute value of the derivative of the envelope with time divided \n\nby the envelope, over a user-defined window. This attribute symbolizes the \n\nstandard deviation of the instantaneous power spectrum about its mean. \n\n \n\n Eq. (22) \n\nWhere d[(env(t)/dt) is called the decay factor. \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n82 \n\n \n\nFigure 59 \u2013 Time slice from an instantaneous bandwidth attribute volume, same time position of \nthe time slice displayed for instantaneous frequency (Figure 57) focused in the E-W channel. The \ncentral part of the channel is now better imaged as well as the lateral lithological variations inside \nthe channel, that can be correlated with abrupt changes in instantaneous bandwidth values.  \n\n \n\nThis attribute should be interpreted combined with the dominant frequency (see \n\nSection IV.3.2.7) and the instantaneous frequency attributes. Compared to the \n\ninstantaneous frequency attribute, instantaneous bandwidth commonly gives lower \n\nfrequency values. The output attribute cube has enhanced features related to \n\nabsorption effects and changes in the seismic character, which are directly related \n\nto changes in lithology (Figure 59). This attribute is also useful to correlate seismic \n\nunits from both sides of a fault.  \n\n \n\nThe maximum value of the colour scale bar should be adjusted in order to achieve \n\na convenient display, depending on the acquisition frequency. \n\n \n\nIV.3.2.7. Dominant Frequency \n\n \n\nDominant frequency is the last attribute which combined with instantaneous \n\nfrequency and instantaneous bandwidth characterizes the time varying spectral \n\nproperties of seismic data. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n83 \n\nThe algorithm used to compute this attribute sums the square of the instantaneous \n\nfrequency with the square of instantaneous bandwidth and calculates the square \n\nroot of the sum (Equation 23) over a user-defined window. This represents the \n\nRMS frequency of the amplitude spectrum.  \n\n Eq. (23) \n\nCombining the three attributes related to the instantaneous power spectrum is the \n\nbest way to look for low frequency shadows which can indicate a potential oil and \n\ngas reservoir, and distinguish channels and salt bodies from the seismic \n\nbackground (Figure 60).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 60 - Time slice from dominant frequency cube, same time position as shown in \ninstantaneous frequency and bandwidth. Comparing the three attributes lateral changes in geology \ninside the channel are better characterized, as well as the seismic signature for a salt body. \n\n \n\nOnce again the colour bar should be adjusted with the frequency component of the \n\ninput seismic data. When combined to instantaneous frequency and bandwidth \n\nattributes the same coulour scale should be used for the three attributes; \n\notherwise the desired result will not be achieved, causing missinterpretation. \n\n \n\nIV.3.2.8. Quadrature Amplitude \n\n \n\nThis attribute calculates the imaginary part, f*(t), of the original seismic trace f(t). \n\nThe imaginary part is computed through the Hilbert transformation by phase \n\nshifting the original seismic trace by 90\u00ba, in a clockwise direction. For further \n\ninformation, see Section IV.3.1.1.  \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n84 \n\nIV.3.3. Structural Attributes Library \n\n \n\nThe Structural Attributes library contains a collection of attributes to help the \n\nstructural geology interpretation process. They are mainly used to isolate and \n\nenhance local structural variations in the seismic reflection patterns. In other \n\nwords, structural attributes detect edges, compute the local orientation and dip of \n\nseismic reflectors and enhance seismic event continuity parallel to the estimated \n\nbedding orientation. In structural attributes, an edge is defined as a discontinuity in \n\nthe horizontal amplitude continuity within the seismic data, that can correspond to \n\nreal faults and/or fractures. \n\n \n\nUnlike attributes from the Complex Trace library, most of the algorithms used to \n\ncompute structural attributes are computed using a collection of traces, by the \n\nmulti-trace method described in Section IV.3. \n\n \n\nThe main attributes available in this library are described below: Dip Deviation; \n\nLocal Structural Azimuth; Local Structural Dip; Structural Smoothing; Variance; Ant \n\nTracking and Gradient Magnitude.  \n\n \n\nIV.3.3.1. Dip Deviation \n\n \n\nDip deviation is a multi-trace-based seismic attribute that tracks rapid changes in \n\nthe local orientation of seismic reflectors; these rapid changes can be interpreted \n\nas edges. The dip deviation algorithm considers the difference between the dip \n\ntrend and the instantaneous dip. Dip estimates are computed from the local \n\nmaxima of the input seismic data and from the maxima of the derivative of the \n\ninput data, which are then smoothed by a Gaussian smoothing operator. \n\n \n\nThis method has proven results in passive margins and soft rocks where the \n\ndownthrown side of a fault typically shows significant dip into the fault. It has also \n\nbeen found to work successfully for low-angle illumination. \n\nIn Petrel, the user has the possibility to control the minimum dip difference to \n\ndisplay trough a slider control, reducing the number of undesirable features. \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n85 \n\nFigure 61b shows a seismic section of dip deviation attribute volume. Major high \n\nangle faults can be identified and more easily interpreted, in the central part of the \n\nfigure, minor faults, also became clearer and easy to interpret when combined with \n\nthe original seismic data (Figure 61a). Since most of the fault features contain high \n\nangles the slider control was positioned to ignore dip deviations values less than \n\n10\u00ba.   \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n \n\n(b) \n\nFigure 61- Comparison between original seismic data and dip deviation attribute.

Local Structural Azimuth and Dip \n\n \n\nIn stratigraphic hydrocarbon reservoirs one of the challenges of today is the \n\ninterpretation of upper and lower unit boundaries of a hydrocarbon indicator and \n\ntheir correlation with seismic reflectors configuration. The internal configuration, or \n\nseismic texture, is another challenge which new seismic attributes are trying to \n\nidentify and interpret automatically, especially after the introduction of 3D seismic \n\ndata and volume attributes (Randen et al., 2000). \n\n \n\nLocal structural azimuth and dip are more than simply attributes to estimate the \n\nazimuth and dip of coherent seismic events. They are also used in Petrel as \n\ninternal algorithms to compute other seismic attributes which honor the orientation \n\nof the seismic reflectors. Seismic attributes are normally extracted vertically along \n\nthe seismic trace; this traditional approach can, in many cases, introduce artifacts. \n\nThe two attributes described here are part of a class of attributes to avoid these \n\nartifacts and ensure that the extracted seismic attributes are invariant to dip and \n\nazimuth (Randen et al., 2000). \n\n \n\nGeologically, in terms of atitude, strike is defined as the compass bearing of a \n\nhorizontal line on a dipping layer, and dip is the angle of the inclination of the bed \n\nmeasured perpendicular to the strike direction. In Petrel, dip has the same \n\ndefinition, but azimuth is generally used rather than strike. Azimuth is a \n\nperpendicular measure to the strike, and is the compass direction (0-360\u00ba) of the \n\nnormal to the plane (Figure 62). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 62 - How dip and azimuth are measured in Petrel 2008.1 (Schlumberger, 2007a). \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n87 \n\nLocal structural azimuth and dip can be computed following three different \n\ncomputation methods with different complexities: (1) Gradient; (2); Event (3) \n\nPrincipal Component (Figure 64).  \n\n \n\n(1) Gradient is the instantaneous azimuth/dip in the sample neighborhood and it is \n\nthe simplest method to estimate local structural azimuth and dip. It consists in \n\ncalculating the gradient vector using a different operator for each of the three \n\ndimensions of space (inline and crossline directions, and vertically in time) by the \n\nsame approximation of the first derivative attribute defined in Section IV.3.1.1. The \n\ncalculated gradient vector is normal to the considered seismic event; in other \n\nwords, it is its tangent. Dip is measured from the z-axis to the gradient vector, and \n\nthe azimuth is the angle of the vertical projection of the gradient vector measured \n\nclockwise from the inline axis. Local structural azimuth ranges from 0\u00ba to 360\u00ba and \n\ndip from -90\u00ba to 90\u00ba. \n\n \n\n(2) Event method computes the downslope azimuth and dip of the estimated \n\nevent. Numerically it calculates the gradient, using the same approximation of the \n\ngradient method (see previous point) but, by convention, the event normal, or \n\ngradient vector, should always point upwards. In comparison to the gradient \n\nmethod, and using the positive z downwards, if the gradient vector has a negative \n\nz-component, then dip and azimuth are equal to dip and azimuth computed by the \n\ngradient method. On the other hand, if the computed gradient has a z-component \n\npositive (pointing downwards) then it should be reversed by multiplying by zero all \n\nthe components, before measuring the angles. This explains the fact that azimuth \n\nranges over 360\u00ba and dip from 0\u00ba to 90\u00ba. \n\n \n\n(3) Principal component is a three step method which consists first in the \n\nestimation of the gradient vector, the local gradient covariance matrix and a \n\nprincipal component analysis. Dip/azimuth vectors should behave like the event \n\nmethod: the principal vector should point upwards before measuring the angles; \n\nazimuth and dip ranges from 0\u00ba to 360\u00ba and 0\u00ba to 90\u00ba, respectively. \n\nIn discrete data there are several derivative approximations in gradient \n\ncomputation. In the principal component method the derivative of Gaussian is \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n88 \n\nused due to joint optimum resolution in time and frequency of Gaussian filters and \n\nnice scalability properties.  \n\n \n\nFor 3D datasets, in order to obtain the derivative of each dimension, a three-\n\ndimensional gradient, the derivative of Gaussian is applied to achieve a gradient \n\nvector with one partial derivative component for each dimension (Equation 24). \n\n Eq. (24) \n\nThe gradient vector computed from this step represents the local azimuth and dip \n\nof the seismic event but can be contaminated by noise and other artifacts. The \n\nlocal gradient covariance matrix estimation, C(t1,t2,t3), is computed instead to \n\nsmooth and eliminate artificial features within the gradient estimate. Smoothing \n\nwraparound effects (slightly changes in angles, but abrupt changes in its \n\nrepresentation, changing from -180\u00ba to +180\u00ba) in dip and azimuth estimates are \n\nnon-trivial. The used approximation is to estimate the covariance matrix of the \n\ngradient vectors and determine the dip as the direction of the principal eigenvector \n\nof the matrix (Figure 63; Randen, 2000). For further details and mathematical \n\ndescriptions about this method it is suggested Iske and Randen (2005). \n\n \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n \n\n(b) \n\n \n\n(c) \n\nFigure 63 \u2013 Principle component steps: (a) calculates local gradient (b) estimates the covariance \nmatrix of the gradient vectors (c) perform principal component analysis: Dominating orientation (in \nred; Schlumberger, personal communication). \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n89 \n\nDip and azimuth estimations, by the principal component method, are powerful \n\ntools not only in the estimation itself, as an attribute, but also to compensate for \n\ndip and azimuth in other seismic attributes algorithms. \n\n \n\n(a) (b) (c) \n\nFigure 64 \u2013 Estimated local structural dip by the three computation methods described above: (a) \ngradient method; (b) event method and (c) principal component method. \n\n \n\nIV.3.3.3. Gradient Magnitude \n\n \n\nBy definition, gradient magnitude is the square root of the sum of the squared first \n\nderivatives, computed following the mathematical expression given by Equation \n\n25, in the three dimensions of space (inline, crossline and vertical directions).  \n\n Eq. (25) \n\nGradient magnitude is an amplitude-sensitive attribute; therefore it can be useful to \n\ndiscriminate areas of weak signal from those with significant reflectivity. Based on \n\nthe coherency of the signal, and the attribute value, it can be used to distinguish \n\ndifferent lithologies (Figure 65). Interpreting time slices with this attribute can add \n\nvaluable clues on fault systems and depositional regimes (Figure 66). \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n90 \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n \n\n(b) \n\nFigure 65 - Comparison between (a) original seismic and (b) gradient magnitude attribute. \nGradient magnitude attribute produces sharper features and distinguish regions with signal \nstrength from those with weak signal content. The noise content is also reduced in the output \nattribute volume. \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n91 \n\nGradient magnitude does not accept user-defined parameters. In order to adjust \n\nthe attribute with the data, the interpreter should use a template with two colours \n\nassociated with the extreme values, and limit the colour scale range. This best \n\npractice can bring out different features from seismic data. \n\n \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n \n\n(b) \n\nFigure 66 - Same time slice from gradient magnitude attribute cube in both figures. In (a) it is \nshown the potential of this attribute in fault enhancement and detection, (b) shows a system of \nancient channels related to a deep-sea turbidite system. Salt bodies are also identified, although \ntheir boundaries are not well defined. \n\n \n\nIV.3.3.4. Structural Smoothing \n\n \n\nStructural smoothing is a fast volumetric signal processing method that applies a \n\n3D Gaussian filter to reduce the noise content of the input data. This attribute \n\nperforms a structure-orientated filtering since it takes into account bed estimated \n\norientations, by the principal component estimation method (see Section IV.3.3.2). \n\nA structure-orientated filter reduces the noise content without loosing information \n\nrelated to edges within the data. \n\nNowadays, the time spent in seismic data interpretation is considerably reduced \n\nwhen compared to the past. Costumers want fast responses with robust \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n92 \n\ninterpretations and reliable geological models which best fit the seismic data with \n\nthe less time-consumption possible. In addition, if in the past most of the \n\ninterpreters were geophysicists they have been mostly replaced by geologists that, \n\nif by one hand are able to build best geological models, by the other hand have \n\nmore difficulties in distinguishing noise from real data, and have little knowledge of \n\nseismic data processing and artifacts (Fehmers and Hocker, 2003). Fast \n\nvolumetric signal processing attributes, and the ones described in IV.3.1, are part \n\nof the available tools in Petrel 2008.1 to help the geoscientist to improve the \n\nsignal-to-noise ratio and make the interpretation easier. \n\n \n\nThe Gaussian filter can be applied with different settings to reduce spatial noise \n\nand improve reflectors continuity. In Petrel 2008.1, the structural smoothing dialog \n\nbox allows the user to active the checkboxes \u201cDip-guide\u201d, \u201cEnhance Edges\u201d and \n\nselect the multi-trace window size within which the attribute is computed. \u201cDip-\n\nguide\u201d computes the local orientation of the reflector and applies the filter \n\nconsidering the estimated orientation (bedding orientation is estimated following \n\nthe method described in Section IV.3.3.2). This option will improve both vertical \n\nand horizontal resolution (Randen et al., 2003). \u201cEnhance edges\u201d enhance and \n\nsharpen the presence of edges, detected by computing the instability of the \n\nstructure, through the chaos attribute (Section IV.3.4.1). \n\n \n\nIn Petrel 2008.1, the Gaussian smoothing operator has the following expression \n\n(Iske and Randen (2005) in Schlumberger, 2007a): \n\n Eq. (26) \n\n? determines the width of the smoothing filter; the size of the smoothing window \n\n(?) is a user-defined parameter which can be adjustable to the data in inline, \n\ncrossline and time directions independently through a slider control. ? has an \n\nallowable range of 0.0 \u2013 5.0 and can be converted easily to an approximate value \n\nin number of traces or vertical samples by: \n\n Eq. (27) \n\nThe structural smoothing cube is perfectly to condition seismic data to use in \n\nautomatic interpretation tools, since the reflectors\u2019 continuity is enhanced leading \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n93 \n\nto increased picking stability. \u201cDip-guide\u201d and \u201cEnhance edge\u201d options, when \n\nactivated, highlight faults and other vertical linear anomalies within the data \n\nfacilitating the structural interpretation process (Figure 67). \n\n \n\n(a) (b) (c) \n\nFigure 67 \u2013 Seismic section in: (a) original amplitude; (b) structural smoothing attribute without \n\u201cDip-guide\u201d checkbox selected, same effect as applying a 3D Gaussian smoothing filter only; (c) \nstructural smoothing honoring estimated bed orientation and automatically detecting edges. \n\n \n\nDue to the many advantages of structural smoothing, this is the best choice to use \n\nas part of Ant Tracking workflow (see Section IV.3.3.6) during the seismic \n\nconditioning step.  \n\n \n\nIV.3.3.5. Variance \n\n \n\nIn probabilistic analysis, variance is the measure of how spread is the dataset \n\naround the mean value Equation 28  \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n94 \n\n Eq. (28) \n\nBased on this statistical definition, Petrel 2008.1 uses the patented algorithm \n\nintroduced by van Bemmel et al. (2000) to compute a normalized population \n\nvariance with an optional weighted vertical smoothing. The variance attribute uses \n\nan algorithm which computes the local variance of the input signal through a multi-\n\ntrace window with user-defined size. \n\n Eq. (29) \n\nWhere xij is the sample value at horizontal position, i, and j is the vertical time \n\nsample. wj-t is the vertical smoothing term over a window of length L. \n\n \n\n\u201cThe Semblance Cube\u201d and \u201cThe Coherency Cube\u201d, the later introduced by \n\nBahorich and Farmer (1995), are common attributes in the oil and gas industry to \n\nmap discontinuities. The algorithm of variance is innovative because it measures \n\ndirectly, without the need of an intermediate step, differences from a mean value. \n\nThe direct measurement produces sharper results, when compared to other edge \n\ndetection methods. \n\n \n\nThe variance attribute is an edge imaging and detection method. The window size \n\nis the critical parameter to obtain discontinuities as sharp as possible. Long \n\nvertical windows produce vertical stripping while short window lengths produce \n\nhorizontal stripping when variance is displayed in cross-sections (Figure 68). The \n\nsize of the window can be adjusted in inline/crossline and vertical directions \n\nindependently. Different values for each of the first two directions can really bring \n\nout depositional features which have a preferential directions in space (e.g. non-\n\nmeandering channels).  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n95 \n\n \n\n(a) \n \n\n(b) \n\nFigure 68 \u2013 (a) Seismic section in original amplitude and (b) variance attribute computed over a \nwindow of 3x3 traces in inline/crossline directions and 15 ms in time.

Ant Tracking \n\n \n\nThe Ant Tracking attribute is a patent-protected algorithm from Schlumberger that \n\nintroduces a new paradigm in fault interpretation. Fault interpretation is still a \n\nmanual, time consuming and very subjective task to the interpreter, and \n\nconsequently difficult to perform accurately. With this new technique, edges \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n97 \n\n(faults, fractures and other linear anomalies) are automatically enhanced, following \n\na standard workflow. The enhanced edges are then automatically or manually \n\ninterpreted (or extracted; Pedersen et al., 2002). \n\n \n\nAn Ant Tracking attribute volume is generated using swarm intelligent concepts \n\nwhere real ants colonies looking for food are mimicked. Real ants use \n\npheromones to mark their paths in order to optimize the search for food (Figure \n\n70). In comparison, Ant Tracking uses a high number of agents (virtual ants) which \n\nare deployed over a seismic discontinuity volume to look for fault zones. \u201cVirtual \n\npheromones\u201d are deployed by these agents when they find a fault zone, resulting \n\nin an attribute volume that shows fault zones in sharp detail. This high level of \n\ndetail is achieved because virtual ants deployed over noisy areas or where there is \n\na surface that does not fulfill the conditions for a fault (e.g. remains of a reflector) \n\nare terminated shortly or immediately, not deploying \u201cvirtual pheromones\u201d \n\n(Schlumberger, 2007b). \n\n \n\n \n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 70 \u2013 (a) Diagram showing two ants starting at the same time at the nest looking for food. (b) \nThe ant which chooses the shortest path, the straight one (black dashed line), will arrive before the \nant choosing the longest path (green dashed line). Therefore, the shorter path will be marked with \nmore pheromones than the longer one, hence the next ant is more likely to choose the shortest \npath (modified from Pedersen, 2002). \n\n \n\nIn order to produce the fault seismic cube there are several volume seismic \n\nattributes which need to be computed in a chain, where the output from each one \n\nwill be the input for the next process. Generally speaking, the required steps in Ant \n\nTracking are: (1) seismic conditioning, to reduce the spatial noise present in the \n\noriginal data; (2) generation of an edge detection cube; (3) calculation of an edge \n\nenhancement volume, which is the Ant Tracking cube itself (Figure 71). \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n98 \n\n \n\nFigure 71 - Ant tracking general workflow (modified from Schlumberger, 2007a). \n\n \n\n From the Ant Tracking cube, faults can be automatic extracted through Petrel\u2019s \n\n\u201cAutomatic Fault Extraction\u201d process, manually interpreted by the traditional way, \n\nor by seeding points to build patches with the Petrel\u2019s \u201cAutomatic Fault Extraction\u201d \n\nprocess active; these patches can be later transformed into fault interpretations in \n\norder to be inserted in the hydrocarbon reservoir model (Figure 72).  \n\n \n\nSeismic conditioning is used to reduce spatial noise within the data, enhancing \n\nreflectors continuity and honoring edges. The structural smoothing attribute is \n\nnormally the seismic attribute extracted in this step. In the edge detection stage, \n\nthe variance cube is normally used, which is an attribute data and structural \n\ndependent; therefore, it should be extracted from seismic data with as less noise \n\nas possible, without losing information about discontinuities. Finally, the edge \n\nenhancement is performed with the realization of the Ant Tracking attribute. The \n\nresulting output can be combined with the original seismic data and/or an edge \n\ndetection cube in fault interpretation. \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n99 \n\nThere are many user-defined parameters to adjust the deployment of the ant \n\nagents. The settings should be chosen to fit the conceptual model about the \n\nstructural system of the area built by the interpreter as a first approach. A brief \n\ndescription of these parameters are summarized in the Table I and have by default \n\ntwo configurations depending on the desired detail level. \u201cPassive Ants\u201d should be \n\nused as a first approach to understand the major regional structural system, since \n\nthe Ant Tacking cube will enhance faults with a low level of detail; only strong \n\nmajor regional faults will be detected with low resolution in the fault extraction. \n\n\u201cAggressive Ants\u201d are used to deploy a large number of ants in the seismic cube \n\nand capture faults in a high level of detail; in this case major and subtle faults from \n\nthe data will be extracted, leading to high resolution on fault extraction. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 72 - Ant Tracking time slice combined with the original seismic data to perform the \n\"Automatic Fault Extraction\" using seeding points. Colour surfaces are fault patches to be used in \nthe geological model. \n\n \n\nApart from these parameters, in Petrel, the user can also use the Stereonet tab. \n\nThis option works as an orientation filter which allows the user to exclude specified \n\norientations from the output volume. With this tab the interpreter can easily \n\nseparate two different fault systems or eliminate footprints present within the data; \n\nsince virtual ants will not be deployed within the rejected areas. The Stereonet is \n\noriented to the inline survey direction. To reject specified dip and azimuth angles in \n\nPetrel (estimated using the methods described in IV.3.3.2) the user should click \n\nover the desired areas and switch them to grey (Figure 73). \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n100 \n\nTable I - Ant Tracking user-defined parameters (modified from Schlumberger, 2007b) \n\nParameter Min.

If these features are enhanced after the ant tracking realization then the \n\nuser can apply them to the entire dataset.  \n\n \n\nTwo tested workflows are proposed to compute the Ant Tracking cube. These two \n\napproaches differ mainly in the number of steps required and in the attribute used \n\nas edge detection method. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n101 \n\n \n\nFigure 73 - Stereonet filter used to compute Ant Tracking cube. Red arrows represent how azimuth \nand dip are calculated. Grey areas represent rejected dip and azimuth ranges. \n\n \n\nAnt Tracking proposed workflows \n\nThe first workflow discussed here is the simplest one. The first step is conditioning \n\nthe original seismic data to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and enhance \n\nreflectors continuity honoring discontinuities orientation. The output attribute from \n\nthis step is the structural smoothing cube (see Section IV.3.3.4). The user-defined \n\nsize of the Gaussian filter should be enough to clean some residual noise within \n\nthe data without losing information related to major discontinuities (Figure 67c). \n\n \n\nThe structural smoothing volume is then used as an input to the edge detection \n\nstep. Several attributes available in Petrel 2008.1 can be used (e.g. Chaos, \n\nVariance, Dip Deviation). In this workflow it is suggested to compute chaos (see \n\nSection IV.3.4.1) volume. For less experience users this may be particular useful \n\nsince there are no user-defined parameters. The Ant Tracking attribute is applied \n\nto the chaos volume with ant parameters and a stereonet filter adjustable to the \n\noriginal seismic data. \n\n \n\nThe second tested workflow is more complex than the first but generally achieves \n\nbetter results. For seismic conditioning a strong structural smoothing filter is used \n\n(e.g. with window of size 3x3x1.5), which will eliminate spatial noise, improving \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n102 \n\ncontinuity without lost of edges information. This strong Gaussian smoothing filter, \n\nin Petrel, should honor seismic reflectors orientation and enhance edges, with the \n\n\u201cDip-guide\u201d and \u201cEnhance Edges\u201d checkboxes selected. For the edge detection \n\nprocess it is suggested to use a variance cube (see IV.3.3.5) with tested \n\nparameters to best fit the data. This variance cube should define faults and other \n\ndiscontinuities with a high level of detail.  \n\n \n\nThe realized variance cube computed is now going to be used as an input to \n\nanother structural smoothing attribute. This second smoothing is just a large 3D \n\nGaussian smoothing filter realized with soft user-defined parameters without \n\nselecting the \u201cDip-guide\u201d option. This step will eliminate possible noise created \n\nduring the execution of the variance attribute. \n\n \n\nThe data is then ready to be used as an input to the Ant Tracking attribute. This \n\nlast step is repeated several times until the output cube has little noise content. \n\nThe first Ant Tracking pass should be computed with parameters which reflect \n\nmore aggressive ants. These first run should detect both major and minor fault \n\nsystems. The output cube will have enhanced real faults and other linear \n\ndiscontinuities with less detail. The Ant Tracking cube is then used as an input to \n\nanother Ant Tracking algorithm extraction, this time with less aggressive ants. \n\nComputing the Ant Tracking attribute over the same attribute cube will detect only \n\nreal faults associated to strong signals, thereby eliminating noisy features. If in the \n\nfinal the output is good enough to extract the faults in a precise way the workflow \n\nis terminated; if not, more Ant Tracking passes should be used. This cascade \n\nedge enhancement reinforces strong features in the volume and reduces the \n\ncontribution of minor features, leading to better final results for fault interpretation. \n\n \n\nThe figure below shows a comparison of the two workflows for a random seismic \n\nintersection. The figure from the right was computed using the longer workflow. \n\nFaults are more consistent in space and well defined improving the \n\ninpterpretablity. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n103 \n\n \n\nFigure 74 - Comparison between two proposed workflows to compute the Ant Tracking cube.

Stratigraphic Attributes Library \n\n \n\nIdentifying stratigraphic features from seismic data is one of the most difficult tasks \n\nin the design of a reliable geological model. Furthermore, the study of stratigraphic \n\nevents is important to understand how the petroleum system of an oil and/or gas \n\nreservoir works. Stratigraphic Attributes comprise attributes related to the \n\nidentification of stratigraphic sequences, lateral and vertical variations of \n\nlithologies, structural orientation measurements, frequency decomposition and \n\nfacies distribution. \n\n \n\nIV.3.4.1. Chaos \n\n \n\nAs the name suggests, the chaos attribute is related to the \u201clack of organization\u201d \n\nwithin a 3D window. This attribute measures how consistent is the dip and azimuth \n\norientation estimated using the principal component method (described in IV.3.3.2; \n\nSchlumberger, 2007b). Estimated measurements with low consistency are related \n\nto a chaotic signal pattern. Chaotic patterns are used to enhance faults, \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n104 \n\ndiscontinuities, salt bodies, and reflectors with chaotic texture which are often \n\nassociated with channel infill or reef textures (Figure 75).  \n\n \n\n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 75 - (a) Chaos attribute in a time slice and (b) in a seismic section.

In (b) the three major features that \nchaos attribute is able to enhance can be identified: faults/discontinuities, salt bodies and chaotic \ntexture within reflectors.  \n\n \n\nAnother important characteristic of the chaos attribute is that it is invariant with \n\namplitude and orientation; therefore it will produce consistent results in areas with \n\nhigh or low amplitudes, and dipping or non-dipping events. The output data range \n\nis scaled between 0, corresponding to non-consistent areas, and 1, for consistent \n\nareas. \n\n \n\nDue to the potential of chaos for edge detection, it is commonly used as part of the \n\nsimple Ant Tracking workflow already discussed in Section IV.3.3.6. \n\n \n\nIV.3.4.2. Local Flatness \n\n \n\nThe local flatness attribute is at the same time a stratigraphic (related to seismic \n\ntextures) and a structural attribute, it is also used to enhance faults and other \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n105 \n\nvertical anomalies (Figure 76). This attribute gives information about the flatness \n\nof the local seismic signal, within a 3D window of user-defined size; the size of the \n\nwindow is defined by adjusting the same ? parameter of the structural smoothing \n\nattribute (see Section IV.3.3.4). \n\n \n\nThis attribute is a two step algorithm. First, it measures the local orientation by the \n\nprincipal component method (see Section IV.3.3.2); then it computes the \n\nnormalized variance on the estimated orientation vector, following the method \n\ndescribed in Section IV.3.3.5. Flatness does not refer to horizontal and non-\n\ndipping seismic events; it is the degree to which the local estimation is planar. If it \n\nis planar there are no discontinuities; if not an edge is detected. The output cube is \n\nscaled between 0 to 1, meaning locally planar and non-planar, respectively. \n\n \n\nTo transform the local flatness attribute invariant with amplitude, showing high \n\nreflectivity seismic events such as low reflectivity features, local flatness should be \n\ncomputed using an invariant attribute volume (e.g. cosine of instantaneous phase) \n\nas an input. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 76 - Time slice from a local flatness attribute volume. This attribute can be considered both \na stratigraphic and a structural attribute. It should be interpreted in time slices rather than seismic \nsections and enhances not only features related to seismic texture and channels infill, but also \nstructural events such as faults and salt bodies. \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n106 \n\nIV.3.4.3. Iso-Frequency \n\n \n\nThe Iso-Frequency Component generates a volume attribute through a patented \n\nseismic decomposition method for user-defined frequencies (Pepper and van \n\nBemmel (2001), in Schlumberger, 2007a). \n\n \n\nThe spectral decomposition is performed locally and consists first in generating an \n\nautocorrelation function of the seismic data on a short time window. The \n\nautocorrelation function is insensitive to the phase content of the original seismic \n\ndata, thus aligning the seismic energy at zero lag. The second step is a cross-\n\ncorrelation between a cosine wave (cosine correlation transform (CCT) method), \n\nwith a user-defined number of cycles, and the auto-correlation function generated \n\nbefore, to determine the numeric similarity of the auto-correlation function and the \n\ncosine wave. The cross-correlation algorithm is defined by: \n\n \n\nEq. (30) \n\nWhere G(k) and H(k) are the two signals being correlated: either the windowed \n\noriginal seismic data to build the auto-correlation function, or the cosine function \n\nand the auto-correlation function. \n\n \n\nThe CCT method output value is a correlation coefficient which measures the \n\ncorrelation between a known cosine wave signature of a specific frequency and \n\nthe auto-correlation seismic data. The output attribute cube is scaled between -1 \n\nto 1. Zero values mean uncorrelated functions. 1 is for identical signal and \n\nnegative values have the same meaning as positive values but indicates inverted \n\npolarities.  \n\n \n\nBesides the cosine frequency, in Petrel, the user has also the option to select a \n\ndesired \u201cNumber of cycles\u201d; this option defines the window length where the \n\nattribute is extracted. The window length depends both on the relative frequency of \n\nthe cosine function and the frequency content of the original seismic data. \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n107 \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n \n\n(b) \n\nFigure 77 \u2013 Same time slice position for two Iso-Frequency volumes computed with a cosine wave \nof (a) 25 Hz and (b) 45 Hz. When (a) and (b) are compared, it is clear that inside the meandering \nchannel there are different values for the correlation, which may indicate changes in lithology inside \nit. In (a), inside the green polygon, it is inferred that the value close to 0 is related to an abrupt \nchange in lithology when compared to the lithology inside the channel. This feature will be \ninterpreted further in this work, in Chapter V. \n\n \n\nShort windows will not focus the correlation energy to illuminate anomalies, while \n\ntoo long windows will show local geologic effects and not tuning effects. There is \n\nalso the option \u201cSpectral Normalization\u201d which performs a spectral whitening and \n\nattempts to remove the signature of the seismic wavelet from the results. \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n108 \n\nThe Iso-Frequency attribute volume may reveal subtle variations in lithology that \n\nmay indicate stratigraphic traps for hydrocarbons. If an interesting feature is \n\nidentified at a designated frequency the resulting cube may represent similar \n\nfeatures with the same frequency signature that may not be identified in the \n\noriginal seismic data. The Iso-Frequency cube helps to identify similar \n\nfeatures/facies already correlated to potential hydrocarbon reservoir features in \n\nother areas within the data. Similar methods of spectral decomposition are \n\nbecoming standard available attributes in most of the interpretation software \n\nsuites. \n\n \n\nIV.3.4.4. Relative Acoustic Impedance \n\n \n\nAcoustic impedance (Z) is an intrinsic physical property of rocks, defined as the \n\ndensity of the geologic formation multiplied by the propagation velocity of p-waves \n\nthrough that formation (Equation 31). \n\n Eq. (31) \n\nTo measure the real value for acoustic impedance it is necessary to use seismic \n\ninversion methods. However, in 1992, Taner demonstrated that Relative Acoustic \n\nImpedance (RAI) can be expressed and computed integrating the real part of the \n\nseismic trace (Equation 33). This method assumes that the input seismic data has \n\nbeen processed to have reduced noise and multiple contamination, and also that it \n\ncontains zero phase and large bandwidth. Based on this assumption the seismic \n\ntrace represents the band limited reflective series Equation 32. The integration of \n\nthe seismic trace will provide a band-limited estimate of the natural log of the \n\nacoustic impedance. Since the integration is band-limited, the impedance will not \n\nhave absolute magnitude values, and consequently is only relative. \n\n Eq. (32) \n\n Eq. (33) \n\nA Butterworth filter is then applied to remove long wavelength trends originated \n\nfrom the integration process (Schlumberger, 2007a). \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n109 \n\n Eq. (34) \n\nPetrel 2008.1 uses a filter with the following parameters: BL(f) is the band-limited \n\nsignal in frequency; fH  is the frequency cutoff and has a value of 10Hz and the \n\nfilter order (N) is 3. \n\n \n\nRAI is not an exhaustive inversion process, since the output volume only reflects \n\nthe apparent acoustic impedance contrasts, or physical property contrasts. \n\nRelative acoustic impedance is used in many calibration procedures since it \n\nmimics the natural log of the acoustic impedance. In interpretation, it is combined \n\nwith the original seismic data to indicate sequences boundaries, associated with \n\nhigh contrasts in Z values, unconformity surfaces and discontinuities (Figure 78). It \n\nmay be also related with porosity within the formations and the presence of fluid \n\ncontent inside a hydrocarbon reservoir.  \n\n \n\n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 78 \u2013 (a) Input seismic data and (b) computed relative acoustic impedance attribute. High \ncontrasts between values of RAI highlights sequences boundaries. Here too, the bottom of some \nancient channels are better interpreted in (b). \n\n \n\nIV.3.4.5. Neural Network \n\n \n\nThe Neural network attribute allows the creation of an attribute classification \n\nvolume based on a pre-conceived estimation model, created by Petrel\u2019s \u201cTrain \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n110 \n\nEstimation Model\u201d process found under \u201cUtilities\u201d (Schlumberger, 2007b). In this \n\nwork an unsupervised estimation model for facies classification was tested using \n\nas input the original seismic cube and derived seismic volume attributes. \n\n \n\nArtificial Neural Networks (ANN) can be defined as information processing \n\nalgorithms that try to mimic the human brain. Unlike conventional computation \n\nalgorithms that always follow the same programmed steps independently of the \n\ninput data, neural networks learn by trial, using a set of inputs, and so are not \n\nprogrammed to perform a specific task (http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk). \n\n \n\nBiological neural networks are made of billions of neurons interconnected, building \n\nextremely complex information networks. Many processes of how information is \n\nprocessed within the human brain are still a \u201cblack box\u201d to the science community, \n\nalthough it is known that neurons are the main components of the human brain. A \n\nneuron is a specialized cell with the ability to propagate an electrical signal and \n\nhas a well known basic structure and operation method. Human neurons are \n\ncomposed of four parts: the nucleus, the dendrites, the axon, and the synapse \n\n(Figure 79). Dendrites are fine structures which receive electrical signals from \n\nother neurons transmitting the signal into the cell body, acting like a branching \n\ninput. The axon is the output connection for electrical pulses emitted by the neuron \n\nwhich splits into thousands of branches. At the end of each branch the synapses \n\nare the connections between neurons. Synapses receive the activity from the axon \n\nand convert it into an electrical effect that inhibits or excites the activity in the next \n\nconnected neuron. If the neuron receives excitatory input sufficiently large when \n\ncompared with its inhibitory input, it sends a spike of electrical activity down its \n\naxon. The human learning process occurs by changes in the effectiveness \n\nresponse of the synapses, i.e. changes in the influence of one neuron on another \n\n(Schlumberger personal communication, www.statsoft.com, www.doc.ic.ac.uk). \n\n \n\nANN use the same principle described in the previous paragraph based on \n\nartificial neurons, with simpler configuration. Artificial neurons are processing units \n\ninterconnected in a complex communication network working together to solve a \n\nspecific task. They receive a set of inputs, which can be fed from multiple sources, \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n111 \n\nwhich are then multiplied by a weight. The weighting result is summed and is \n\npassed through a transfer function returning one or more outputs.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 79 - Diagram of a human neuron and its components: Nucleus; Axon; Dendrites and \nsynapse (modified from www.doc.ic.ac.uk). \n\n \n\nPetrel 2008.1 uses feed-forward networks ANN, the output of any processor unit is \n\nnot an input to other processor unit. Each input (X(n)) is received by artificial \n\nneurons  similar to dendrites. Then a weighted sum of the inputs from all the units \n\nis computed. The importance of the input (X(n)) is measured by the weight of the \n\nconnection (W(n)). The output is 1 or 0 according to whether the weighted sum is \n\nabove or below a certain threshold. The neuron is adapted to a particular situation \n\nadjusting the values of the weights and the threshold value (Figure 80; \n\nSchlumberger personal communication; www.doc.is.ac.uk).  \n\n \n\nThe learning process method is another key factor to achieve the best possible \n\nresult. Petrel uses adaptive networks, since ANN are able to change their weights \n\ndepending on the input (www.doc.is.ac.uk). There are two ways of adaptive \n\ntraining: supervised and unsupervised. Training supervised neural networks is only \n\npossible when there are available training data. The training data combined with \n\nthe input data are used to optimize the weights for each input. The computed data \n\nfrom the neural network is constantly compared with the training data to give the \n\nerror of the estimation. This method is normally used in facies estimation using \n\nwell log data as training data and seismic attributes as input data.  \n\nUnsupervised trained neural networks are those where there are not available \n\ntraining data. The output is given in terms of classification, based on a probabilistic \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n112 \n\nanalysis of the input data. The input points are plotted in \u201cn\u201d dimensions, where \u201cn\u201d \n\nis the number of pieces of input data. Using the Competitive Learning Algorithm \n\nthe centre of points of each class are first distributed randomly then adjusted to fit \n\nthe input data. The process subdivides the input data into a number of user-\n\ndefined classes and it self-organizes it, detecting collective properties between \n\nthem. This method is normally used with the purpose of discovering the underlying \n\nstructure of the data, encode, compress or transform the data (Schlumberger, \n\n2007b; www. www.doc.ic.ac.uk). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 80 - Schematic representation of how a virtual neuron used by Petrel 2008.1 works \n(modified from www.doc.is.ac.uk). \n\n \n\nUsing neural networks has particular benefits when the final goal is the recognition \n\nof seismic patterns and data classification. \n\n \n\nWorkflow to compute an unsupervised Neural Network in Petrel 2008.1 \n\nBefore computing the neural network attribute it is necessary to build an estimation \n\nmodel using the \u201cTrain Estimation Model\u201d process. This process takes the input \n\ndata points with the associated seismic attributes and calculates an additional \n\nattribute, a seismic classification cube. The input data should be carefully chosen \n\nin order to increase the chances of success, reducing the processing time. To \n\ncompute the facies classification cube pre-selected attribute volumes, extracted \n\nfrom the original seismic cube, were used as input data. The attribute selection \n\ncan be done by two methods: (1) the correlation between attributes; (2) Principal \n\nComponents Analysis (PCA). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n113 \n\n(1) Before computing the estimation model, in order to classify seismic data into \n\nfacies, it is first necessary to build an idea about which attributes are related to \n\nlithologies and seismic textures. From the previously described seismic attributes \n\nalong this chapter there are a lot of potential cubes that can be selected. Attributes \n\nrelated to the energy and frequency content of the data, which give information \n\nabout the distribution of the acoustic impedance along the cube, and finally \n\nspectral decomposition attributes are the natural choice of an expert user in a first \n\napproach.  \n\n \n\nAs stated before, a high number of input data can have the opposite effect of what \n\none would assume, leading in most of the cases to an unsatisfactory final output. \n\nThe input data should be cross-plotted against each other and should not have \n\neither a perfect correlation (Figure 81) or being uncorrelated. The plot should have \n\na constant spatial distribution with points which can be group into families (Figure \n\n82). The attributes that exhibit this correlation rules are the ones that should be \n\naccepted. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 81 - Cross-plots of seismic attributes whit potential use in a neural network to create a \nfacies classification cube. RMS amplitude Vs. Gradient magnitude attributes. The correlation \nbetween the two is perfect; therefore just one of these attributes should be used. \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n114 \n\n \n\nFigure 82 - Shows a cross-plot between RMS amplitude and Iso-Frequency with 25 Hz. The \ncorrelation is optimal to use into an estimation model. The data correlation is distributed and can be \ngrouped by classes, represented here by the four different colours. \n\n \n\nAfter the first trial of seismic attributes, the ones that show an acceptable behavior \n\nin the cross-plots should be selected in the \u201cTrain Estimation Model\u201d process. \n\nThey should be next passed through a correlation analysis for quality control, that \n\nis accessed in the process dialog box (Figure 84b). The analyzed attributes should \n\nhave a correlation between 0.3 \u2013 0.5 and present a cell box coloursed with green \n\nor light yellow in the correlation table (Figure 83). In Figure 83 blue cell boxes \n\nrepresent correlation values between 0 \u2013 0.3, which means that the seismic \n\nattributes are not correlated; consequently they should not be used together in the \n\n\u201cTrain Estimation Model\u201d. Red cell boxes symbolize seismic attributes highly \n\ncorrelated. As stated before too correlated attributes should not be used to train \n\nthe neural network. Highly correlated seismic attributes enhance the same \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n115 \n\ncharacteristic of the original seismic data; therefore just one of the correlated \n\nattributes should be used. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 83 - Example of a correlation table from a correlation analysis between Iso-Frequency \nattributes, Envelope and Variance. Red and blue cell boxes are not desired in the \u201cTrain Estimation \nModel\u201d. Green and light yellow represent acceptable correlation values. \n\n \n\n(2) Principal Component Analysis is a linear multivariable technique used to \n\nreduce the dimensionality of the input vectors helping to separate the necessary \n\nfrom the accessory in the input data before applying it into the estimation model. \n\nThis method of data analysis overcomes the problems related to the graphically \n\nrepresentation of n seismic attributes in n dimensions. In this case, it is not \n\npossible to analyze trends, highlight similarities and differences in the input data. \n\nPCA is a powerful tool to analyze the data and reduce the number of dimensions \n\nwithout loosing important information. Reducing the number of dimensions of the \n\ninput data, using the PCA method, is a reliable solution to reduce the time-\n\nconsumption of the process, and help the neural network to reach a solution with \n\nless associated error. An example of PCA is shown in the in table Figure 84a, \n\nwhere Eigenvalues, ordered from the highest to the lowest value, give an \n\nindication of the relative importance of the Principal Components. Understanding \n\nthe correlation between attributes and the contribution of each input data, Principal \n\nComponents (PC) which contains less or less important information should be \n\nexcluded. The PCs that have been passed through the quality control are then \n\nselected. \n\n \n\nThe facies classification cube, computed by a neural network which has been \n\ntrained by an estimation model build following the rules described above, is \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n116 \n\npresented in Section V.2.2, Figure 121. More details about which attributes were \n\nused in this case and how they were selected are also discussed in that Section. \n\n \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n \n\n(b) \n\nFigure 84 - (a) Principal Component Analysis table.

Surface Attributes \n\n \n\nA surface attribute is the value of an attribute relative to a single horizon and an \n\ninterval window, between two horizons or within a constant time window. It can be \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n117 \n\ncomputed in Petrel using the \u201cSurface Attributes\u201d processes under \u201cGeophysics\u201d. \n\nPetrel 2008.1 has fifty surface attributes divided into four areas depending on the \n\napplied algorithm: Amplitude; Statistical; Signal Shape and Measurable Interval.  \n\n \n\nIn Petrel, surface attributes can only be computed in surfaces built from horizon \n\ninterpretation. The process dialog box is divided into seven areas and the user can \n\nchose as many options to withdraw the maximum potential from the extensive list \n\nof available attributes. An example of the attributes dialog box to compute surface \n\nattributes is shown in Figure 85: (1) from the attribute library the user should \n\nchoose the desired seismic attribute; (2) a seismic cube from where the attribute \n\nwill be extracted needs to be set as input; (3) the attribute can be generated from \n\nthree types of window specification: a) between a surface and a time window, \n\n\u201cSingle Horizon\u201d; b) between two horizons, \u201cHorizon-Horizon\u201d; and c) inside a \n\nconstant time window, \u201cZ-Z\u201d. After the window specification, a surface should be \n\nset as the input; 4) besides the type of window, the attribute can run above or \n\nbelow a user-defined length from a user-defined event. These events are \u201cNone\u201d, \n\n\u201cLargest Peak\u201d, \u201cClosest Peak\u201d, \u201cLargest Trough\u201d, \u201cClosest Trough\u201d, \u201cZero \n\nCrossing +/- \u201d, or \u201cZero Crossing -/+\u201d. If needed, a second surface, window \n\nspecification, type of event and special parameters should be set up. \n\n \n\nSurface attributes are much more dependent on the user interpretation, and \n\nconsequently dependent on the user picking of a horizon, than volume attributes \n\ncomputed with user-defined parameters. The subjective percentage related to this \n\nprocess can lead to misunderstood interpretations and the creation of artifacts in \n\nmap attributes which are directly related to the picking interpretation (Figure 86).  \n\n \n\nDepending on the hydrocarbon reservoir, surface attributes have different values \n\nin depositional regimes interpretation as they are computed from zero-phase \n\nseismic data or RAI data. For \u201ctop heavy\u201d reservoirs, when there is a coarsening \n\nupward sequence from the bottom to the top, the more useful zero-phase attribute \n\nwill be; on the other hand, the less \u201ctop heavy\u201d is the hydrocarbon reservoir, the \n\nmore RAI attributes will be useful (Schlumberger, 2007a). \n\n \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n118 \n\nIn this thesis only three surface attributes, all related to energy content of the \n\nseismic data, are described. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 85 \u2013 Petrel\u2019s Surface Attributes process dialog box. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 86 - Interpreted horizon and RMS amplitude attribute computed over a window of 5 ms \nbelow the horizon. Comparing with another horizon interpretations, very high values of RMS \namplitude are interpreted as artifacts related to a poor picking stability. High Values in the center of \nthe horizon can be interpreted as high porosity sands. \n\n\n\nChapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 \n\n119 \n\nIV.4.1. RMS Amplitude \n\n \n\nRMS amplitude is the same attribute described in Section IV.3.1.8 but computed \n\nrelative to a surface with all the user-defined settings as discussed before. \n\nAttributes maps of RMS amplitude may isolate amplitude response features from \n\nthe background (Figure 86), or act as a direct hydrocarbon indicator. \n\n \n\nIV.4.2. Extract Value \n\n \n\nThe extract value attribute is more like a valuable utility than a seismic attribute in \n\nthe truly meaning of the word. This attribute allows the user to extract the value of \n\na seismic attribute volume relative to a single surface. It allows the production of \n\nsurface attribute maps of attributes that are not available in the surface attributes \n\nlibrary.  \n\n \n\nIV.4.3. Half Energy \n\n \n\nThe half energy attribute computes the time or depth required for the energy within \n\na window to reach one-half of the total energy of the entire window, throughout \n\n(Equation 35). \n\n Eq. (35) \n\nAttribute maps of half energy are used to infer possible asymmetric changes in \n\nlithology or porosity (Figure 87). \n\n \n\nIn this work, more attention was given to volume attributes in Petrel 2008.1 than to \n\nsurface attributes. This is due to the high potential of visualization and application \n\nof the former. In fact, seismic attribute volumes are creating a new paradigm in 3D \n\nseismic interpretation.  \n\n \n\nMore attributes can be computed using Petrel\u2019s tool \u201cSeismic Calculation\u201d. This \n\ntool allows not only to directly extract new information from seismic data but also \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n120 \n\nallows combining available seismic attributes with each other, or to compute their \n\nderivatives in respect to time or space. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 87 - Interpreted horizon and half energy attribute computed over a window of 5 ms below \nthe horizon. Abrupt changes in the attribute value may indicate lithological changes. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n121 \n\n \n\nChapter V.   The Role of Seismic Attributes \n\nin 3D Seismic Interpretation: A Case \n\nStudy Offshore West Africa  \n\n \n\nIn the previous chapter, a brief introduction was given to the standard seismic \n\nattributes available in Petrel 2008.1. In this chapter, seismic attributes are applied \n\nto the recognition and characterization of a potential area of hydrocarbon \n\naccumulation, from an area offshore W. Africa, where information from well log \n\ndata is not available. \n\n \n\nThe interpretation process was divided into two different stages, following the \n\nstandard method of 3D seismic data interpretation applied by most oil and gas \n\ncompanies: (1) \u201cProspect Generation\u201d - during this stage, a raw interpretation of \n\nthe original seismic data is carried out, and volume attributes are computed to \n\nidentify structures that may correspond to potential hydrocarbon reservoirs; this \n\ncan be followed by geobody extraction for inclusion into reservoir geological \n\nmodels; (2) \u201cAdvanced Interpretation\u201d \u2013 this corresponds to the interpretation of \n\nkey seismic reflectors and derived surface attributes (or attribute maps) inside the \n\ntarget area(s) delineated in (1). A first approach to facies classification, based on \n\nan artificial neural network method, was also performed on the seismic data. \n\n \n\nV.1. Prospect Generation \n\n \n\nThe \u201cprospect generation\u201d started with the interpretation of the seabed surface \n\n(Figure 2). The seabed was automatically tracked along the seismic cube, based \n\non the interpretation of a coarse grid of inline/crosslines, constrained by a \n\nstructural smoothing cube. This is particularly important for this study area \n\nbecause the seabed surface is intensely affected by the underlying salt bodies, \n\npreferentially orientated NNW-SSE, sinuous channel complexes roughly orientated \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n122 \n\nE-W, and regional faults with NNE-SSW and NNW-SSE direction trends (Figure \n\n88). The orientation of the sinuous channels complexes is mainly constrained by \n\nthe subcrop of the salt bodies. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 88 \u2013 Preliminary interpretation of the seabed at a regional scale. Red elipses represent \nelongated salt bodies. Arrows show the direction of the main channels and white dashed lines \nindicate the main trend of regional faults. \n\n \n\nA detailed analysis of the seabed surface is also useful to detect the potential \n\npresence of any gas related features.  \n\n \n\nV.1.1. Identification of Gas Related Features \n\n \n\nA detailed interpretation of the sea bottom surface for the study area, combined \n\nwith the interpretation of vertical seismic sections, allowed the identification of \n\nseveral alignments of round depressions, interpreted as pockmarks (Figure 89). \n\nPockmarks are seafloor depressions caused by the escape of gas or fluids from \n\nthe subsurface; escape paths usually exploit faults or zones of weakness (Evans, \n\n2003). Pockmarks are important structures because they reveal the presence of \n\nhydrocarbons at depth. Therefore, in the study area, the identification and \n\ninterpretation of pockmarks at the seabed surface was used as a first approach to \n\n\n\nChapter V The Role of Seismic Attributes in 3D Seismic Interpretation \n\n123 \n\nevaluate its hydrocarbon potential. Following the gas escape path in depth, using \n\nvertical seismic sections, allows the interpretation of hydrocarbon accumulations. \n\nAligned pockmarks reveal the presence of faults, which most of the times follow a \n\nregional trend. Buried pockmarks indicate ancient periods of gas escape, and \n\nwere also identified in some vertical seismic sections (Figure 90). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 89 \u2013 Aligned pockmarks identified at the sea-bottom and followed at depth along vertical \nseismic sections.

Analysis of Deep-Sea Channel Complexes \n\n \n\nDeep-sea channel complexes have seen their importance grow in the oil and gas \n\nexploration industry as proven hydrocarbon reservoirs. These depositional \n\nfeatures are of particular interest offshore Angola, Brazil, Guinea, Gulf of Mexico \n\nand India (Kolla et al., 2007). Published seismic sections from deep-sea sinuous \n\nchannel complexes (or channel-levee systems) often show high amplitude \n\nreflections from their erosional bases, which are flanked by low seismic amplitude \n\noverbank deposits (or levees; Kolla et al., 2007). In these depositional \n\nenvironments, low amplitudes can be correlated with shales and/or mudstones, \n\nwhile high amplitudes are lithology-indicative of sands (Evans, 2003). The \n\navailability of recent 3D seismic datasets with high horizontal and vertical \n\nresolution, which are easily handled by leading edge seismic interpretation \n\nsoftware, combined with the advances in the exploration and production \n\ntechnology from submarine channels, allow a better understanding about the \n\ngeometry, architecture, and the spatial/temporal distribution of deep-sea channel \n\ncomplexes (Posamentier, 2003; Wynn et al., 2007). \n\n \n\nIn the last few decades highly sinuous channel complexes are understood as \n\ncommon depositional features of modern deep-sea fans. Deep-sea fans are thick \n\nsedimentary features associated with gravitationally driven mass movement \n\ndeposits. These movements include turbidite deposits, mass movement debries \n\nand pelagic drapes (strata.geol.sc.edu). These sediments can be later reworked \n\nby bottom currents, creating in this way complex systems of sinuous channels \n\n(Kolla et al., 2007). The presence of stacked and amalgamated channels \n\ninterpreted in the seismic dataset (Figure 91) suggest that the study area \n\ncorresponds to the \u201cupper fan\u201d section of a deep-sea fan morphologic model \n\n(Figure 92; strata.geol.sc.edu). \n\n \n\nChannel-levee systems can be interpreted on vertical seismic sections by their \n\nlarge erosional bases associated with high amplitude reflections. Often, several \n\ncuts, also with high amplitude reflections, can be interpreted above the main \n\nerosional base. Each cut corresponds to a new position of the channel in time. \n\n\n\nChapter V The Role of Seismic Attributes in 3D Seismic Interpretation \n\n125 \n\nChannels can also migrate laterally or suffer vertical aggradation processes \n\n(Figure 91a; Figure 93).  \n\n \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(b) \n\nFigure 91 \u2013 (a) Typical vertical seismic section with interpreted stacked channels commonly found \nthroughout the seismic cube under investigation. Around the 1000ms ancient channel complexes \ncan also be identified, but it is very difficult to interpret each channel independently. (b) Schematic \nrepresentation of the evolution of the channel along time (Kolla et al., 2007). The channels \ninterpreted in (a) can be correlated with the geometries represented in (b). Both lateral migration \nand vertical aggradation are observed. \n\n \n\nThe architecture and geometry of the submarine channels can be correlated to \n\nconceptual models which describe the relative position of the channel, the mode of \n\nthe cuts and the fill with the temporal evolution (Figure 91b). \n\n \n\nStrong analogies between deep-water sinuous channel complexes and fluvial \n\nsystems have been recently done in order to understand more about how deep-\n\nwater complexes work. In fact, there are many similarities between both systems; \n\nhowever, the analogy should be done carefully since there are substantial \n\ndifferences in the internal architecture and the mode of evolution of deep-water \n\nchannel complexes (Kolla et al., 2007; Wynn et al., 2007).  Submarine channel \n\nnormally have smoother bottoms with low angle overbanks and a highly vertical \n\naggradation nature (Wynn et al., 2007). These differences are related to density \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n126 \n\ncontrasts of flows relative to ambient fluids, the effect of centrifugal and Coriolis\n16\n\n \n\nforces on flows, modes of sediment transport, and effects of sea level changes \n\n(Kolla et al., 2007).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 92 - Schematic representation of a deep-sea fan complex morphology. The interpretation of \nstacked and amalgamated sinuous channels shown in this Chapter, places the study area \nsomewhere in the \u201cupper fan\u201d section of the deep-sea fan (from Christopher and Kendal (2006) in \nstrata.geol.sc.edu).  \n\n \n\nIn the oil and gas exploration industry the recognition of a channel system in \n\nvertical seismic sections is important, but tracking it in space is the key factor to \n\nfully evaluate the depositional feature as a possible hydrocarbon reservoir. \n\nUnfortunately, using standard horizontal time slices along the seismic cube is not \n\nenough to carry a good interpretation of the channel complexes. Submarine \n\n                                            \n16\n\n Coriolis force is an apparent deflection of the centrifugal force produced by the Earth. Due to this effect, \nmoving particles in Earth\u2019s surface suffer a displacement to the right in the northern hemisphere, and to the \nleft in the southern. \n\n\n\nChapter V The Role of Seismic Attributes in 3D Seismic Interpretation \n\n127 \n\nchannels are not perfectly horizontal because they follow the regional dip of the \n\narea; consequently, horizontal time slices are not generally parallel to the \n\nchannels\u2019 surface, originating misinterpretations or difficulties in the correlation \n\nbetween the vertical seismic sections and the time slices.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 93 - Example of a sinuous channel system with lateral continuous channel migration as well \nas some aggradation. The sinuous channel complex, and associated overbank deposits, are \nhoused in a larger master valley, bounded by master overbanks. \n\n \n\nAn example of a horizontal time slice extracted from the original amplitude seismic \n\ncube of the study area is shown in Figure 94. Here, high amplitudes do not define, \n\non their own, channel-levee systems associated with deep-sea sinuous channel \n\ncomplexes. This happens because the horizontal slicing is not parallel to the dip of \n\nthe channel complexes. In order to overcome this drawback there are three \n\npossible best practices: (1) to combine vertical and horizontal seismic intersections \n\nin a 3D view in order to follow a channel (see, for example Figure 95); this is an \n\neffective method if there is a channel which can be identified and isolated in \n\nhorizontal time slices; (2) by using seismic attributes, in particular the ones that \n\nenhance edges (e.g. variance IV.3.3.5), to distinguish between different channel \n\nsystems, isolate depositional features and correlate them with the original seismic \n\n(Figure 96);  (3) by using the strata slicing method described in Zeng (1998a; b), \n\nwhich is generally the best approach. \n\n \n\nIn this work, considering its main objectives and due to time constraints, only the \n\nfirst and the second methods were used.  \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n128 \n\n \n\nFigure 94 - Example of a time slice extracted from the original seismic cube. The identification of \nthe sinuous channel complexes (one such system is highlighted inside the black box) is not \nimmediate because the channels\u2019 surfaces and the time slice are not parallel. \n\n \n\nA channel system can be observed in time slices along the original seismic volume \n\n(see Figure 94 and Figure 95). In order to enhance it for easier interpretation, \n\nseismic attributes (e.g. variance, gradient magnitude, chaos) were computed.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 95 \u2013 Interpretation of a horizontal time slice from the original amplitude cube which allowed \nthe identification of the target channel system (on the left). Also shown (on the right) a composite \n3D view of a horizontal time slice and a vertical seismic section focusing on the target sinuous \nchannel system. \n\n\n\nChapter V The Role of Seismic Attributes in 3D Seismic Interpretation \n\n129 \n\nThe variance seismic volume was the most useful attribute volume to use in the \n\ninterpretation of this depositional system. Its interpretation, combined  with the \n\noriginal seismic data, allowed the definition of: (1) an area of several sinuous \n\nchannel-levee complexes, which can be considered a \u201cminor unit\u201d of a submarine \n\nfan (Figure 96a; Wynn et al., 2007); (2) a well defined channel-levee system, \n\nelongated NNW-SSE, with potential to be a hydrocarbon reservoir; for this reason, \n\nmost of the seismic attributes were tested at this site (henceforth, this target will be  \n\nreferred to as the target channel system; Figure 66b; Figure 96b). \n\n \n\n \n(a) \n\n \n\nFigure 96 \u2013 (a) Variance time slice showing several salt bodies (in red), faults and sinuous channel \ncomplexes belts (inside the green lines). (b) close up to the target channel system, where an \noxbow from a near channel complex can be identified. Note the much superior quality of the \nattribute map for interpretation, compared with the original seismic section (Figure 95). \n\n \n\nThe interpretation of several time slices along the variance attribute cube allowed \n\na preliminary characterization of the depositional elements that belong to the \n\ntarget channel system. This system comprises a well defined sinuous channel, \n\nwith levees and cutoff loops (or oxbows), within a larger channel belt (Figure 96; \n\nFigure 97). The channel-levee system is seismically characterized by high \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n130 \n\namplitudes at the bottom, a low-amplitude fill and a thin bed with high amplitudes \n\nin the central part of the channel which may indicate a sand fill (Figure 98). \n\n \n\nThe presence of loop cutoffs (Figure 96; Figure 97) highlights the dynamic nature \n\nof these systems and is evidence of turbidity flows with high erosive power \n\n(Posamentier, 2003). A detailed examination of meander loops illustrates both the \n\nswing and sweep effects. Swing is the lateral loop migration and/or expansion of \n\nthe channel system; sweep is a down-system sinuous loop migration (Figure 99; \n\nPosamentier, 2003; Wynn et al., 2007).  \n\n \n\nThe levees associated with the target channel system have variable height and the \n\nsame configuration as the ones from another channel system in the study area, \n\nillustrated in Figure 93. Levees are part of the so called master and secondary \n\noverbanks, and are often related to floodplains (term used in analogy with land \n\nfluvial systems). \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 97 - Variance time slice highlighting the target channel system. The green line represents \nthe limit of the sinuous channel belt. At this \u201cdepth\u201d (TWT) along this time slice, an incipient cutoff \nand several point-bar scrolls can be interpreted (compare also with Figure 66b). The inset in the \nupper right corner shows a fluvial meandering system; there is a clear analogy in the overall \nmorphology of the two systems. \n\n\n\nChapter V The Role of Seismic Attributes in 3D Seismic Interpretation \n\n131 \n\n \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n \n\n(b) \n\nFigure 98 \u2013 (a) Horizontal time slice showing the target channel system.

Both the effects of swing and \nsweep were identified. \n\n \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n132 \n\nIn addition, a depositional element interpreted as a crevasse splay was also \n\nidentified. The interpretation was based on both the variance and the Iso-\n\nFrequency (see Section IV.3.4.3) attributes. A crevasse splay is a depositional \n\nfeature, associated with highly energetic turbidity currents, which often appears at \n\nsharp bends that break the outer levee leading to the development of an \n\nunconfined lobate or tongue-shaped deposit in the overbank area (Figure 100b; \n\nPosamentier, 2003). This depositional element was first identified in the study area \n\non variance time slices (Figure 100a) as an isolate body that does not correspond \n\nto an ancient location of the channel system. Using the Iso-Frequency attribute \n\nand comparing different cosine frequencies (Figure 77a; b) it has been shown that \n\nthe feature inside the green polygon is different from the lithology inside the target \n\nchannel system (the correlation value is different for the same cosine frequency). \n\nThis feature has been interpreted as a crevasse splay, based on its morphology, \n\nthe interpretation of indicative-lithology seismic attributes, the interpretation of the \n\nsurrounding environment and the analogy with modern fluvial systems. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 100 \u2013 Horizontal time slice of the variance attribute showing a depositional feature \ninterpreted as a crevasse splay, combining variance with Iso-Frequency attribute. (b) Is an aerial \nphoto of a crevasse slay in a fluvial system. \n\n \n\nEdge detection attributes such as variance and gradient magnitude can also be \n\nextremely useful to understand the behavior of sinuous channels that cannot be \n\ntracked on time slices from the original seismic cube. In particular, the \n\ninterpretation of channel complexes in vertical seismic sections is often very \n\n\n\nChapter V The Role of Seismic Attributes in 3D Seismic Interpretation \n\n133 \n\ndifficult and ambiguous. The example below shows a vertical seismic section \n\nwhere three channels can be identified (Figure 101a), based on their morphology \n\nand character. However, a combined display of the vertical seismic section with a \n\nvariance time slice (which, as discussed above, is good for highlighting features \n\nsuch as these) allows unraveling the fact that, instead of three separate channels, \n\nwe are dealing with just one channel which is meandering in the direction \n\nperpendicular to the vertical seismic section (Figure 101b). \n\n \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n \n\n(b) \n\nFigure 101 \u2013 (a) Seismic inline where high amplitude and erosive seismic reflectors are interpreted \nas individual channels bottom. (b) The combined interpretation of the same seismic line with a \nvariance time slice highlights the channel system, in high resolution, and allows the correct \ninterpretation of a single meandering channel. \n\n \n\nFully understanding the depositional systems associated with deep-sea channel \n\ncomplexes is still a recent branch in 3D seismic interpretation. 3D seismic datasets \n\nallow nevertheless a much better knowledge about these systems. The \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n134 \n\nintroduction of seismic volume attributes to enhance depositional elements, in \n\nparticular stratigraphic and structural attributes, has brought a new reality to the \n\ninterpretation of deep-sea channel complexes. Combined visualizations in three-\n\ndimensions, for example (Figure 102), allow the recognition and correlation of \n\nseismic patterns with depositional features interpreted from seismic intersections \n\nof the volume attribute. Tracking 3D depositional events in space using seismic \n\nattributes is now a much easier task and contributes to a better understanding of \n\nthe architectural relationship of the various depositional elements and their \n\nposition and evolution in time. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 102 - Variance attribute along a time slice, combined with the original seismic data. This \ntype of display allows the correlation between seismic patterns and depositional events and makes \ntracking depositional elements much easier. \n\n \n\nV.1.3. Salt Tectonics \n\n \n\nSalt tectonics played a very important role in the structural development of the \n\nmarginal sedimentary basins off West Africa. In fact, this process allowed the \n\n\n\nChapter V The Role of Seismic Attributes in 3D Seismic Interpretation \n\n135 \n\ncreation of many structural oil traps which are nowadays major hydrocarbon plays \n\nwithin the study area. \n\n \n\nThe salt is an evaporite with unique properties and behavior: it is uncompressible, \n\nit has low density (~2.2g/c\n3\n), a high seismic velocity, a high level of plasticity and \n\nzero porosity. Therefore, it is impermeable and can act as a seal.  \n\n \n\nWhen compared to other sediments, the salt has higher densities until \n\napproximately the 1000m depth (Figure 103). Since the salt is uncompressible its \n\ndensity remains the same with the increase in depth; on the other hand, \n\nsediments, which are compressible, become denser than salt with the increase in \n\ndepth (Figure 103). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 103 - Diagram of salt\u2019s density vs. depth. At approximately 1000m the salt starts to be less \ndense than the sediments surrounding (modified from Dobrin and Savit, 1988). \n\n \n\nThe salt is deposited in layers with constant thickness, but due to its mechanical \n\nproperties and the weight of the sediments above, it moves upwards creating \n\nintrusive bodies with different shapes and configurations. Traditional shapes of salt \n\nbodies are: diapirs, salt domes, salt walls, massif salt, allochthonous salt, salt \n\npillows, and salt canopies (Figure 104; Figure 108). \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n136 \n\n \n\nFigure 104 - Different salt bodies morphology (modified from Trusheim, 1960). \n\n \n\nBuoyancy and differential compaction are the two main processes which trigger \n\nthe salt movement to produce the salt bodies previously mentioned. The buoyancy \n\nphenomenon acts due to the weight of denser sediments above the salt layer. The \n\nsalt moves laterally to an area of weakness of the overlying bed, creating a \n\nthinning below the denser sediments (Figure 105).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 105 \u2013 Buoyancy phenomenon (modified from Garcia, 2008). \n\n \n\nThe differential compaction occurs by two reasons: (1) when there are sediments \n\nwith variable densities above a salt layer (Figure 106); (2) when there is a local \n\ndifference of sediment volumes above the salt layer. The lateral variations of \n\ndensity, or volumes, cause a thinning of the salt layer below the denser sediments. \n\nThese density differences are translated in a movement of the salt to areas with \n\nlower densities, creating a rising in the sedimentary layer above. \n\n  \n\n \n(a) \n\n \n(b) \n\nFigure 106 \u2013 Differential compaction (modified from Garcia, 2008). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter V The Role of Seismic Attributes in 3D Seismic Interpretation \n\n137 \n\nSalt tectonics was a key process in the configuration of the sedimentary basins off \n\nWest Central Africa. The movement of the salt to upper stratigraphic levels \n\nchanged the configuration of sedimentary sequences allowing the creation of \n\nhydrocarbon traps (Figure 107).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 107 - Common types of hydrocarbon traps associated with the movement of salt bodies \n(from www.geo.wvu.edu). \n\n \n\nIn seismic data with original amplitudes, salt bodies exhibit a chaotic texture and \n\nare generally easily identified (Figure 108). However, in order to be able to isolate \n\nand enhance the salt bodies, high resolution variance (see Section IV.3.3.5; Figure \n\n96) and instantaneous frequency (see Section IV.3.2.5; Figure 58) attributes \n\nshould be used, as shown earlier in this Chapter. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 108 - Example of a vertical seismic line within the study area, showing a salt diapir and a \nsalt dome. \n\n \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n138 \n\nV.1.4. Structural Control in the Study Area \n\n \n\nA preliminary characterization of the principal types of faulting in the study area \n\nwas performed, by identifying faults in the original seismic cube, and also using \n\nautomatic detection algorithms, such as Ant Tracking (see Section IV.3.3.6) on the \n\nvariance (see Section IV.3.3.5) cubes. \n\n \n\nThe main trends of the principal regional faults were interpreted both by their \n\nexpression on the seafloor morphology and by the alignments directions of \n\npockmarks and salt bodies (Figure 88). The interpreted regional faulting trend is \n\nmainly NNE- SSW and NNW-SSE. The two principal types of faults identified in \n\nthe study area are: (1) steep normal and strike-slip faults; (2) small faults with a \n\nradial geometry immediately above the salt bodies. \n\n \n\n(1) The steep faults are characterized by their extension from deep in the section \n\nto the seafloor, and normally follow the two main faulting direction trends \n\nmentioned above (Figure 109). At several locations, these faults act as conduits \n\nfor the salt intrusions, as described in Section V.1.3. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 109 - Vertical seismic section showing a regional steep fault with expression at the seabed \n(see inset at the lower left corner). The salt body probably moved along the fault in depth. \n\n\n\nChapter V The Role of Seismic Attributes in 3D Seismic Interpretation \n\n139 \n\n Interpreting these faults at \u201cdepth\u201d (TWT) is also important since oil migration \n\npaths from the sub-salt to above the salt can also be identified. Most of the proven \n\nactive petroleum systems in the study area have their source rock below the salt \n\nlayer and high quality reservoirs in the upper stratigraphic sequences. \n\n \n\n(2) Small faults with radial geometry (Figure 110) can be interpreted as faults \n\nassociated with the intrusion of salt in the layers above. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 110 - Small faults created by the salt intrusion. \n\n \n\nA detailed interpretation of the different faults system, both at large and small \n\nscales, along the target area should always be performed in order to identify \n\npossible reservoir areas. Conjugate faults with the right geometry, can act as \n\nstructural hydrocarbon traps due to the closure of high porous lithologies against \n\nfaults which do not allow fluid circulation along them. Fault closure is often \n\nobserved in vertical seismic sections by abrupt termination of bright reflections \n\nagainst interpreted faults (Figure 111). Seismic attributes can be useful in the fault \n\ninterpretation and characterization processes. \n\n \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n140 \n\n \n\nFigure 111 - Example of a fault trap system. Enhanced reflectors terminate abruptly against faults \ngiving the needed closure to trap the hydrocarbons (Schlumberger, personal communication). \n\n \n\nV.1.5. Geobody Extraction \n\n \n\nGeobody Extraction is a leading edge utility, in Petrel, that allows extracting \n\nvisually and interactively features of interest from the seismic data. Each feature is \n\nisolated blending several seismic volumes with user-defined settings. The isolated \n\nseismic feature is then extracted into a discrete object, the geobody itself, by a \n\nsimple mouse click using the method \u201cwhat you see is what you pick\u201d. The \n\ngeobody can then be used for different purposes: essentially, it can be sampled \n\ninto a geological model grid to be populated with properties (e.g. porosity, \n\npermeability), or its boundaries or middle surfaces converted in horizon \n\ninterpretation points. These interpretation points can be used to help the traditional \n\ninterpretation process or can be inserted into a hydrocarbon model after being \n\nconverted into surfaces. Channels and salt domes are typical features which have \n\nproven results in geobody extractions. The \u201cGeobody Extraction\u201d process, in \n\nPetrel, can be found under Geophysics (Schlumberger, personal communication). \n\n \n\nThe first step of the extraction process is the introduction of a probe. A probe can \n\nbe defined as a cropped rendering of one or more blended seismic volumes, in \n\nwhich the seismic feature will become isolated. Seismic volumes used to create \n\nthe probe should allow the isolation of the feature through a contrast in colours \n\n\n\nChapter V The Role of Seismic Attributes in 3D Seismic Interpretation \n\n141 \n\nbetween the target feature and the background data; the isolation is achieved \n\nusing the opacity curve of each seismic cube. The probe should also have enough \n\nsize to cover the area of the feature to be extracted. Since the geobody extraction \n\nprocess is a very intensive process, it is suggested to draw a polygon around the \n\nseismic feature and clip the probe outside it. This last step will reduce the \n\nrendered probe volume, increasing the speed of visualization and manipulation.  \n\n \n\nFeatures are isolated by accessing the \u201cOpacity Tab\u201d in the probe settings. This \n\ntab shows the colour scale bar and a histogram of colours amplitudes for each \n\nseismic volume that were used to create the probe (Figure 112). \n\n \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n \n\n(b) \n\nFigure 112 \u2013 Example of two probes\u2019 \u201cOpacity Tab\u201d, used in the \"Extract Geobody\" process, to \nextract: (a) a channel using a variance cube. Values of variance meaning discontinuities have been \nremoved from the display (grey area); and (b) a salt body, using a blend of variance and \ninstantaneous frequency cubes. Only a small interval of instantaneous frequency values is typical \nof a salt body signature, the rest of the values are not displayed in the probe (grey area). As a \ncomplement to isolate the salt body, the values of variance meaning continuity were hidden (grey \narea). \n\n \n\nColour intervals which are not part of the desired feature can be filtered and \n\nremoved from the probe visualization, interactively, by turning their correspondent \n\nareas into grey, inside the histogram display. Grey areas are not displayed in the \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n142 \n\nprobe visualization, isolating the feature to be extracted from the background data \n\n(Figure 113; Figure 114). \n\n \n\nTo extract the isolated feature into a geobody, Petrel\u2019s \u201cExtract Geobody\u201d function \n\nneeds to be activated. Then, the interpreter just needs to click on the isolated \n\nfeature. The geobody will be automatically created and converted into a discrete \n\nobject based on a user-defined threshold opacity value. If a cell has an opacity \n\nvalue below the user-defined threshold value, the area will not be sampled into the \n\nobject; on the other hand, if the cell has an opacity value above the threshold, it \n\nwill be inserted into the geobody.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 113 - Isolated target channel system using a variance probe and the opacity curve shown in \nthe Figure 112a. The probe is now ready to the \u201cextract geobody\u201d process, since it is isolated from \nthe background. Figure 115, in blue, shows the extracted channel system as a geobody. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter V The Role of Seismic Attributes in 3D Seismic Interpretation \n\n143 \n\n \n\nFigure 114 - Isolated salt dome using a blend of instantaneous frequency and variance probes. \nThe opacity curve for each attribute is shown in Figure 112b. The geobody representing this salt \ndome is shown on Figure 115, in light green. \n\n \n\nTwo geological features have been extracted as a geobody in the scope of this \n\nwork: the turbidite target channel system; and a nearby salt dome. The channel \n\nwas isolated using a probe representative of the variance attribute, where values \n\nrelated to discontinuities were hidden, using the \u201cOpacity Tab\u201d shown in Figure \n\n112a. The variance attribute is the adequate choice to isolate channels since \n\nnormally, inside the channel, there are many continuous reflectors with values of \n\nvariance close to 0. On the other hand, the border of the channel often appears as \n\ndiscontinuities in the variance attribute, with values of variance equal to 1 (Figure \n\n113). This contrast in continuity allows a perfect isolation and extraction of the \n\nchannel as a geobody (Figure 115). \n\n \n\nThe salt dome was extracted using two attribute volumes at the same time: the \n\ninstantaneous frequency and the variance cubes. These two attributes were \n\nchosen because the former is good to fill the inside of the salt body (salt bodies \n\nshow low instantaneous frequency values), while the variance attribute enhances \n\nits boundaries. With the adjusted opacity curve for both attributes (Figure 112b) \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n144 \n\nthe visual isolation of the salt dome became very good (Figure 114). The extracted \n\ngeobody from the salt dome is shown on Figure 115 (in green). \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 115 - Geobody of the target channel system (in blue) and a salt dome (in green), above a \ntime slice of the variance cube. The variance time slice can be used to compare the level of detail \nthat can be achieved using Petrel\u2019s \u201cextract geobody\u201d process.  \n\n \n\nV.2. Advanced Interpretation and Facies Classification \n\n \n\nGenerally, at the advanced interpretation stage the main objective is the \n\ncharacterization of potential geological features, identified in the prospect \n\ngeneration stage, which may act as hydrocarbon reservoirs. The target channel \n\nsystem, identified in Section V.1.2, is a potential stratigraphic hydrocarbon \n\nreservoir, and consequently was used here as a testing area for advanced \n\ninterpretation. \n\n \n\nAt this stage, the standard procedure of an oil and gas company is the \n\ninterpretation of the key seismic reflectors that define the potential hydrocarbon \n\nreservoirs, and the analysis of attribute maps using surfaces provided by the \n\nadvanced interpretation process. \n\n\n\nChapter V The Role of Seismic Attributes in 3D Seismic Interpretation \n\n145 \n\nV.2.1. Surface Attributes Interpretation \n\n \n\nIn this work, an interpretation of the upper and lower boundaries of the target \n\nchannel system (Figure 116) was attempted, using a manual interpretation picking, \n\nguided by the interpretation points provided by the extracted geobody (see Section \n\nV.1.5.). A middle horizon, within the manually interpreted upper and lower \n\nboundaries of the target, was interpreted by automatically converting the middle \n\nsurface of the geobody into interpretation points. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 116 - Interpretation of the upper (in green) and lower (in orange) boudaries of the target \nchannel system in a vertical seismic section. \n\n \n\nThe interpretation of the boundary surfaces of the target channel system was \n\ndivided in two phases: (1) the manual interpretation of closely spaced \n\ninlines/crosslines, in order to create a tight interpretation (Figure 117a); (2) the \n\nspatial extrapolation of the interpretation grid picks, applying the Petrel\u2019s \u201c3D \n\nAutotracking\u201d function constrained by a structural smoothed cube (see Section \n\nIV.3.3.4; Figure 117b). Using a seismic cube with reduced spatial noise and \n\nenhanced seismic reflectors continuity to extrapolate a dense interpretation grid, \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n146 \n\nwas the best approach to create reliable surfaces on such a complex sinuous \n\nchannel system. \n\n \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n \n\n(b) \n\nFigure 117 \u2013 (a) Interpretation grid of the upper horizon boundary; (b) the result of applying the \nPetrel\u2019s \u201c3D Autotracking\u201d function in (a) to extend spatially the interpretation. A polygon around the \nchannel was used to constrain the autotracked interpretation.  \n\n \n\nIn order to characterize the target area, the interpretation of attribute maps is \n\nnecessary. Attribute maps, or surface attributes in Petrel, are extracted from \n\n\n\nChapter V The Role of Seismic Attributes in 3D Seismic Interpretation \n\n147 \n\nsurfaces and not from interpretation points (Petrel\u2019s \u201cMake Surface\u201d process, \n\nfound under Utilities, allows the conversion of the interpretations points into \n\nsurfaces).  \n\n \n\nSeveral surface attributes, with different parameters were extracted from the \n\ninterpreted surfaces of the target channel system. RMS amplitude and Iso-\n\nFrequency (using different cosine frequencies) were the most promising attributes, \n\nusing a search window of 100ms below the upper boundary surface. \n\n \n\nThe RMS amplitude (see Section IV.3.1.8) attribute was the first surface attribute \n\ngenerated since it can easily detect porous lithologies, which normally have the \n\npotential to form high quality hydrocarbon reservoirs. The generated attribute map \n\n(Figure 118) shows a well defined area of high RMS amplitude values inside the \n\ntarget channel area (Figure 118, inside the white circle). This area is interpreted as \n\ncorresponding to high porosity lithologies (sand-like). This RMS amplitude \n\nanomaly become more interesting since it is consistent in depth using different \n\nsearch windows lengths (e.g. in Figure 86, the same anomaly was also observed \n\nin a surface attribute extracted with a shorter window length). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 118 - RMS amplitude extracted below the top surface with a search window of 100ms. A \nsmall area with high RMS amplitude values, inside the with circle, can be indentified.  This high \nvalues are probaly related to porous sands, and may indicate a potential hydrocarbon reservoir. \nHigh vaules in the flank of the channel are artifacts induced by the horizon picking. \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n148 \n\nHigh RMS amplitude values in such a small area can be indicative of a potential \n\nsite for hydrocarbon accumulation. To test this assumption, Iso-Frequency \n\nattribute maps were computed. \n\n \n\nSurface attributes with different Iso-Frequencies (Section IV.3.4.3) were extracted \n\nfrom the upper boundary surface. The interpretation of these attribute maps was \n\ncomplemented with the information given by the RMS amplitude attribute maps, \n\nalready discussed above.  The interpretation of the attribute map shown in Figure \n\n119, extracted with a cosine frequency of 25Hz, allows a much better delineation \n\nof the same area already identified in RMS amplitude surface attributes. The area \n\nof interest, when compared to the surrounding areas, shows a constant value of \n\nIso-Frequency allowing a better spatial delineation of the interpreted high porosity \n\narea. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 119 \u2013 Iso-Frequency surface attribute extracted with a cosine frequency of 25Hz, 100ms \nbelow the upper surface of the target channel system. It is possible to interpret an area of interest \n(inside the green circle) with different lithology when compared to other areas inside the channel \nsystem. Compare with Figure 118. \n\n \n\nDue to time limitations, other surface attributes were not extracted in the scope of \n\nthis work and the characterization of the area of interest was complemented, using \n\nhorizontal time slices from several volume attributes. Although, as previously \n\ndiscussed, the target channel system is not parallel to horizontal time slices, if only \n\n\n\nChapter V The Role of Seismic Attributes in 3D Seismic Interpretation \n\n149 \n\na small area inside the channel system is considered, a horizontal time slice \n\nextracted at the same two-way-time of the target area is a good approximation.  \n\n  \n\nV.2.2. Facies Classification Cube \n\n \n\nAt the end of the interpretation process, a facies classification cube was computed \n\nusing an unsupervised artificial neural network (see Section V.2.2), using seismic \n\nattributes volumes as training data. This artificial neural network facies \n\nclassification was computed with the objective of mapping lithological variations \n\ninside the target channel.  \n\n \n\nFour attribute cubes, two Iso-Frequency (see Section IV.3.4.3) volumes, with \n\nfrequencies at 30 and 35Hz, one envelope (see Section IV.3.2.2), and one \n\nvariance (see Section IV.3.3.5) cube, were used as input to train the estimation \n\nmodel of the neural network.  \n\n \n\nThese attributes were found to be the best input to train the neural network, in \n\nPetrel 2008.1, because each of these attributes enhances different features in the \n\nseismic data, but in all of them, the output attribute volume is lithologically \n\ndependent. In addition, they all showed a good behavior in the (1) correlation and \n\n(2) in the principal component analysis. \n\n  \n\n(1) The correlation table computed between the chosen attributes (Figure 83) does \n\nnot follow the requirements described in Section IV.3.4.5. There are high \n\ncorrelation values between the 30Hz and 35Hz Iso-Frequency volumes (red cells), \n\nand low correlation values between the variance and the envelope attributes (blue \n\ncells). However, the correlation rules should not be followed blindly, and seismic \n\nattributes should also be selected by their potential output information, if they are \n\nsuitable for the original dataset and what answers the user requires from the \n\nneural network process. In this case, in spite of the high correlations observed \n\nbetween the two Iso-Frequency cubes, they have proven, nonetheless useful to \n\ninfer variations in lithology and therefore both were used. The variance cube was \n\nused since it enhances discontinuities and the main objective of computing the \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n150 \n\nfacies cube was the delineation of the target channel system and its lithological \n\nvariations. The variance cube also shows good correlation values with the Iso-\n\nFrequency cubes. The envelope cube has good correlation values with all the \n\nother attributes and, since it is an attribute related to the energy content of the \n\ndata, it is useful to distinguish lithological variations. From a general point of view, \n\nthe correlation table shows acceptable values between the selected attributes to \n\ntrain the neural network (Figure 83). \n\n  \n\n(2) The principal component analysis (PCA; Figure 120) allowed reducing the \n\ndimensionality of the input vectors, due to the low value of the Eigenvalue relative \n\nto the principal component PC4. As a result, only the three first PCs were used, \n\naccelerating the classification process and reducing the uncertainty associated \n\nwith the neural network process.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 120 - Principal component analysis table used to select the input to train the neural \nnetwork. \n\n \n\nPetrel\u2019s unsupervised neural networks allow grouping the information provided by \n\nthe several inputs in a user-defined number of classes. In this case, 4 classes \n\nwere used as a starting point. The Competitive Learning Algorithm in the \u201ctrain \n\nestimation model\u201d ran until the 100\nth\n interaction and the input data was placed in \n\nthe most probable class every time the probabilistic value was greater than 0.10.  \n\n \n\nThe output facies volume, computed in this way, shows each user-defined class \n\nwith a different colour, that can ideally be assigned to different lithologies (Figure \n\n121). From the combined interpretation of the facies classification cube, the \n\noriginal seismic data, and the seismic attributes used to train the estimation model, \n\na preliminary correspondence between the class, the original seismic texture and \n\n\n\nChapter V The Role of Seismic Attributes in 3D Seismic Interpretation \n\n151 \n\nthe lithology is proposed: Class 1, in purple, was interpreted as corresponding to \n\nhigh amplitudes in the original seismic data and can be related to high porosity \n\nlithologies, such as sands; Class 2, in yellow, was interpreted as corresponding to \n\nchaotic patterns in the seismic data such as those associated with salt bodies; \n\nClass 3, in orange, was interpreted as corresponding to low amplitude seismic \n\nreflectors, which may indicate the presence of mudstones or shales; Class 4, in \n\ngrey, was interpreted as corresponding to discontinuities, such as borders of salt \n\nbodies, channels and channels systems. \n\n \n\nFrom the interpretation of horizontal time slices along the facies classification cube \n\nfollowing the target channel system (Figure 122) it was possible to interpret lateral \n\nchanges in lithology inside the turbidite channel and to define an area of interest. \n\nThis area was already identified in many seismic attributes, particularly surface \n\nattributes (see Section IV.4) and, following the correspondence between class and \n\nlithology, it was interpreted as high porosity sands. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 121 \u2013 Facies classification cube computed using an artificial neural network. As training \ndata two Iso-Frequency cubes with 30 and 35Hz, an envelope and a variance cube were used. In \nthis horizontal section a salt dome and several channel complexes including the target channel \nsystem can be distinguished. \n\n \n\nThis facies classification cube presented here is considered a first approach to \n\ninfer about the subsurface lithology in the survey area. However, unsupervised \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n152 \n\nneural networks have limitations since there are no real parameters to constrain \n\nthe model and therefore the results should be interpreted with caution. When well \n\nlog data is available well constrained results can be achieved since the output of \n\nthe neural network is constantly compared with the real data in order to achieve a \n\nconvergence between the estimated facies and the well log data, resulting a more \n\nreliable model.   \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 122 - Time slice from the facies classification volume.  Based on the interpretation of each \nclass it may be inferred that the area of interest in the central part of the target channel systems (in \npurple) is possibly related with highly porous sands and therefore a potential hydrocarbon \nreservoir. \n\n \n\nV.2.3. Preliminary Characterization of a Hydrocarbon \n\nReservoir \n\n \n\nThe delineated area, inside the target channel system, was identified from the \n\ninterpretation of the surface attributes (Section V.2.1), and it was characterized \n\nusing a combination of several seismic attributes. \n\n \n\nStructural attributes, with a highlight for the variance cube, showed and allowed \n\nthe identification and morphological characterization of the turbidite channel \n\n\n\nChapter V The Role of Seismic Attributes in 3D Seismic Interpretation \n\n153 \n\nsystem. From the geological background of the study area, turbidite channels are \n\noften proven and high quality hydrocarbon reservoirs. Consequently, further \n\ninterpretation, based on other seismic attributes, was also carried out to delineate \n\nthe area with more potential to contain hydrocarbon accumulations and therefore \n\nwith more likelihood to be a hydrocarbon reservoir. \n\n \n\nA potential hydrocarbon area was identified inside the target channel system \n\n(Figure 123). This area was identified by its response to well known seismic \n\nattributes which are indicative of the presence of hydrocarbon accumulations: (1) \n\nhigh values of original amplitudes (Figure 98) were the first clue; (2) the envelope \n\nattribute showed a limited area with high values (Figure 123), which are often \n\nindicative of porous lithologies, such as sands; (3) the instantaneous frequency \n\nattribute was interpreted in time slices immediately below the time slices where the \n\nenvelope attribute was interpreted and it showed, for the same area of high values \n\nof envelope, low frequency values, when compared to the rest of the channel \n\n(Figure 123); this is a common signature of sands filled with gas; (4) the RMS \n\namplitude attribute map (Figure 118) showed the same behavior of the envelope \n\ntime slice, reinforcing the interpretation idea of a hydrocarbon area; (5) finally, the \n\nIso-Frequency attribute, together with the Relative Acoustic Impedance, allows a \n\nbetter correlation of these hydrocarbon evidences with the spatial facies \n\ndistribution (Figure 119; Figure 124).  \n\n \n\nThe faulting pattern is another important factor to characterize a hydrocarbon \n\nreservoir. For this case, the Ant Tracking cube did not show any major faulting \n\nalong this potential hydrocarbon reservoir. \n\n \n\nIn conclusion, a careful interpretation of the extracted seismic attributes, available \n\nin Petrel 2008.1, over the study area allowed: (1) the identification of the \n\ndepositional systems in the study area and the consequent identification and \n\ncharacterization of stacked turbidite channel systems which can be potential high \n\nquality hydrocarbon reservoirs; (2) the recognition of what may be a hydrocarbon \n\nreservoir inside the target channel system, by its response to energy, frequency \n\nand spectral decomposition attributes; (3) the confirmation that the target section \n\nof the turbidite channel is possibly filled with sands, in contrast to the rest of the \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n154 \n\nchannel, based on the seismic classification cube (V.2.2), computed from seismic \n\nattributes.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 123 \u2013 Two horizontal time slices which follow the potential hydrocarbon reservoir, showing \nlow values of instantaneous frequency in a time slice computed immediately below (on the left) a \ntime slice extracted from the envelope cube (on the right). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 124 - Time slice of Relative Acoustic Impedance attribute along the potential reservoir area. \nCombined with the Iso-Frequency attribute RAI allowed to delineate the accumulation area in \nspace \n\n \n\nThis potential reservoir area can also be delineated in the extracted geobody to \n\nuse for further hydrocarbon modeling (Section V.1.5; Figure 125).  \n\n\n\nChapter V The Role of Seismic Attributes in 3D Seismic Interpretation \n\n155 \n\n \n\nFigure 125 - Extracted geobody for the entire target channel system with the hydrocarbon reservoir \narea enhanced. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n157 \n\nChapter VI. Conclusions \n\n \n\nSeismic attributes can nowadays generally be calculated in most of the modern \n\ninterpretation workstations and they are powerful tools to help the seismic \n\ninterpretation process. Attributes derived from seismic data try to mimic the \n\ninterpreter\u2019s expertise, displaying the seismic data, which is normally plotted in \n\namplitudes, from a new point of view. Interpreting the seismic data together with \n\nextracted seismic attributes often results in new insights into the data and the \n\ndiscovery of relationships between seismic events which are not always evident. \n\n \n\nThe proliferation of high quality 3D seismic data, associated with huge \n\ndevelopments in seismic interpretation software, made seismic attributes reliable \n\nsolutions to solve ambiguous situations in the seismic interpretation process. \n\nHowever, attributes derived from seismic data cannot be applied as a general \n\nrecipe, even if there are many examples in the literature that try to correlate the \n\nattributes with the expected results. These correlations should be done with \n\nespecial care, since the output volume attribute, depending on the geological \n\nbackground of the dataset, may produce unexpected results. As a best practice to \n\navoid misinterpretations, the interpreter needs to first identify the feature of interest \n\nbefore interpreting seismic attributes, and should always refer to the original data \n\nduring the attribute guided interpretation. \n\n \n\nSeismic attributes are however extremely useful tools in the identification and \n\ncharacterization of hydrocarbon reservoirs since they are either directly sensitive \n\nto a reservoir property of interest or allow the user to interpret the structural and \n\ndepositional systems of the study area far more easily. Identifying potential \n\nfeatures which may act as hydrocarbon traps is the first step for a successful oil \n\nand gas exploration.  \n\n \n\nIn the scope of this work, the Petrel \u201cseismic-to-simulation\u201d software was used to \n\ngenerate and interpret the studied seismic attributes. This software has an \n\nextensive list of seismic attributes to help the seismic interpretation process. In \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n158 \n\nPetrel, seismic attributes are first classified into volume and surface attributes (the \n\nequivalent to attribute maps), and then divided into different libraries according to \n\nthe expected output extraction algorithm. Petrel\u2019s seismic attributes which have \n\nthe most potential are: all those belonging to the Seismic Signal Processing \n\nLibrary (see Section IV.3.1); envelope (see Section IV.3.2.2); instantaneous \n\nfrequency (see SectionIV.3.2.5); variance (see Section IV.3.3.5); structural \n\nsmoothing (see Section IV.3.3.4); local structural azimuth and dip (see Section \n\nIV.3.3.2); Ant Tracking (see Section IV.3.3.6); chaos (see Section IV.3.4.1); Iso-\n\nFrequency (see Section IV.3.4.3) and relative acoustic impedance (see Section \n\nIV.3.4.4).  \n\n \n\nBriefly, the seismic attributes listed above, when properly applied to seismic data \n\ncan significantly increase the signal-to-noise ratio, resolve areas with low \n\nresolution, detect subtle lithological variations, enhance seismic reflectors\u2019 \n\ncontinuity (by increasing the interpretation picking stability with automatic \n\nalgorithms), help the structural interpretation (by automatically enhancing edges), \n\nenhance depositional features and train artificial neural networks to estimate facies \n\ndistribution, including reservoir properties prediction between wells, and compute a \n\nfacies classification cube with new information that can help to better understand \n\nthe geology of the study area. Some attributes are also direct hydrocarbon \n\nindicators (DHIs). A summary of the most used seismic attributes, in Petrel, with \n\ntheir description and applicability is given in Table II. \n\n \n\nThe interpretation of the dataset investigated in this work (see section Chapter V), \n\nand the study of the derived seismic attributes, allowed the identification of areas \n\nwith pockmarks and the delineation in detail of salt intrusions and faults. In \n\naddition, a turbidite channel system with an area which may be a hydrocarbon \n\nreservoir (Figure 125) was also identified and interpreted. The variance attribute \n\nwas successfully used for the characterization and identification of the depositional \n\nsystems in the study area. Energy and frequency attributes (e.g. RMS amplitude, \n\nIso-Frequency, Relative Acoustic Impedance) allowed the identification and \n\ncharacterization of the potential hydrocarbon reservoir. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter VI Conclusions  \n\n159 \n\nTable II \u2013 Summary of the most promising seismic attributes available in Petrel 2008.1 \n\nAttribute Name Description Applicability \n\nRMS Amplitude \nThe \u201croot mean square\u201d of the original amplitude within a user-\ndefined window (Section IV.3.1.8). \n\nDistinguish between lithological changes.

Since it is invariant with amplitude \nis used conjugated with the instantaneous phase attribute. \n\nEnvelope \nIs the modulus, or the total instantaneous energy, of the complex \nseismic trace (Section IV.3.2.2). \n\nDistinguishes stratigraphic, lithologic, and fluid lateral variations inside a \nhydrocarbon reservoir; and major changes of lithology and sequency boundaries. \nIt Can also be used as a DHI, it may identify bright spots.  \n\nInstantaneous \nFrequency \n\nIs the rate of change in time of instantaneous phase attribute. \n\nTypically used to interpret lateral and vertical changes in lithology and identify \nfaults by absorption effects. Can also be used as a DHI, since the presence of \ngas often causes what so called low-frequency shadow, below the hydrocarbon \nreservoir. \n\nLocal Structural \nAzimuth and Dip \n\nUses three methods to estimate the orientation of a bed. The \ngradient method calculates the gradient in 3 directions. The event \nuses the same approximation of the gradient method but with a \ndifferent convention. The principal component method uses a \nprincipal component analysis to estimate the orientation \n\nEstimates the orientation, azimuth and dip, of a seismic reflector.

Can also be used to interpret depositional elements. \n\nRelative Acoustic \nImpedance \n\nIt tries to estimate the natural acoustic impedance log by \nintegrating the original seismic trace and filtering it through a \nButterworth filter. \n\nHigh values of relative acoustic impedance are often related with unconformity \nsurface, sequence boundaries and discontinuities. It may also be used to detect \nthe presence of fluids within the data. \n\n\n\nSeismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs \n\n160 \n\nThis interpreted potential hydrocarbon reservoir needs to be investigated in more \n\ndetail to improve the odds of a successful exploratory drill. Horizons between the \n\nupper and lower boundaries need to be consistently picked and several attribute \n\nmaps should be extracted and interpreted to achieve a better reservoir \n\ncharacterization and delineation. \n\n \n\nFuture work should include the development of multi-attribute analysis for the \n\nautomatic prediction and correlation of seismic textures with reliable facies \n\ndistribution models. Automatic faults and fractures enhancement and detection is \n\nanother important aspect in which seismic attributes workflows can have high \n\nimportance and could be further developed. Further studies should also be done in \n\norder to tie attributes with well log data, if available, which will enable better \n\ncorrelations between the attributes and the petrophysical properties of a \n\nhydrocarbon reservoir.  \n\n \n\nLastly, the four months internship at Schlumberger allowed the author to become \n\nfamiliar with the daily routine of an employee in a support team from a service \n\ncompany for the oil and gas industry. It also allowed him to complement his \n\nacademic background with new concepts related to seismic data processing, \n\nseismic attributes and seismic interpretation in the characterization and \n\nidentification of potential hydrocarbon reservoirs. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n161 \n\n \n\nChapter VII.
