No entanto, os conhecimentos e os estudos \n\nrealizados sobre cet\u00e1ceos nesta regi\u00e3o s\u00e3o muito limitados. De facto, grande parte da \n\ninforma\u00e7\u00e3o sobre a ocorr\u00eancia de cet\u00e1ceos na Costa Algarvia \u00e9 proveniente de dados de \n\narrojamentos, que indicam a possivel presen\u00e7a de 11 esp\u00e9cies de cet\u00e1ceos diferentes.\n\n Para uma melhor compreens\u00e3o da utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o das \u00e1guas a Sul da Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica \n\npelas diferentes esp\u00e9cies de cet\u00e1ceos que a\u00ed ocorrem, \u00e9 necess\u00e1ria uma caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndas esp\u00e9cies ou popula\u00e7\u00f5es existentes ao largo da costa algarvia. Neste sentido, \n\npretende-se com este projecto levar a cabo uma caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o da \u00e1rea entre Lagos e o \n\nCabo de S\u00e3o Vicente no que se refere \u00e0s esp\u00e9cies de cet\u00e1ceos que a\u00ed possam ocorrer e \n\ncomparar os resultados obtidos com dados dispon\u00edveis referentes \u00e0s popula\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nestudadas at\u00e9 ao Estreito de Gibraltar. \n\n Para este estudo utilizar-se-\u00e3o dados recolhidos em coopera\u00e7\u00e3o com uma \n\nempresa de Whale watching \u201cMar Ilimitado\u201d, tomada como plataforma de oportunidade \n\npara recolha de dados no campo. A recolha dos dados est\u00e1 limitada \u00e0 \u00e1rea abrangida \n\npela empresa (Sagres-Lagos), bem como pelo limite de dist\u00e2ncia \u00e0 costa a que a \n\nembarca\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e1 sujeita, no caso em quest\u00e3o 5 milhas. Para o presente estudo ser\u00e3o \n\nrecolhidos e analisados dados correspondentes \u00e0 \u00e9poca de 2009, complementados com \n\ndados anteriormente recolhidos pelos t\u00e9cnicos da empresa, correspondentes a uma s\u00e9rie \n\ntemporal com in\u00edcio no ano de 2005. Pretende-se tamb\u00e9m complementar estes dados \n\ncom informa\u00e7\u00f5es fornecidas por outras empresas existentes ao longo da costa algarvia. \n\n Com este projecto espera-se obter os conhecimentos necess\u00e1rios para a \n\ncaracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o das popula\u00e7\u00f5es de cet\u00e1ceos ocorrentes na costa Sudoeste de Portugal e \n\ncontribuir para o alargamento desses conhecimentos \u00e0 costa Sudoeste da Pen\u00ednsula \n\nIb\u00e9rica. Especificamente, espera-se obter uma listagem das esp\u00e9cies de cet\u00e1ceos que \n\nocorrem entre Lagos e o Cabo de S\u00e3o Vicente; uma base de dados de ocorr\u00eancia, \n\ndistribui\u00e7\u00e3o e abund\u00e2ncia de cet\u00e1ceos na \u00e1rea de estudo; cat\u00e1logos destinados a permitir \n\na foto-identifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos cet\u00e1ceos ocorrentes na \u00e1rea de estudo, em particular os golfinhos \n\ncomuns, a esp\u00e9cie consistentemente mais observada na regi\u00e3o; mapas com a \ndistribui\u00e7\u00e3o das esp\u00e9cies, grupos ou indiv\u00edduos observados ao longo do per\u00edodo coberto \n\npelo estudo; mapas de poss\u00edveis hotspots para as esp\u00e9cies presentes; distribui\u00e7\u00e3o das \n\nesp\u00e9cies em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 batimetria e declive da \u00e1rea de estudo; an\u00e1lise da coes\u00e3o e \n\nestrutura dos grupos; presen\u00e7a ou aus\u00eancia de crias para as esp\u00e9cies mais \n\n\n\n \n \n\n6 \n\nfrequentemente avistadas, nomeadamente o golfinho comum e o golfinho roaz; comparar \no cat\u00e1logo de foto-identifica\u00e7\u00e3o de golfinho comum, elaborados no \u00e2mbito deste projecto, \n\ncom documentos equivalentes abrangendo ocorr\u00eancias no Golfo de C\u00e1diz. \n\nEntre os anos de 2005 a 2009, inclusive, foram avistados na \u00e1rea de estudo 556 grupos \n\nde golfinhos comuns, resultando numa taxa de avistamento (ER) de 2.01 \n\navistamentos.100 km-1. \n\n Apenas durante o ano de 2009, foram avistados 228 grupos de cet\u00e1ceos, \n\ncorrespondendo ao encontro de 6 esp\u00e9cies diferentes na \u00e1rea. Entre estes, a esp\u00e9cie \n\nmais avistada foi o Golfinho Comum (182 avistamentos; ER = 1,9 avistamentos.100km-1), \n\no Boto (22 avistamentos; ER = 0,2 avistamentos.100km-1) e Golfinho Roaz (20 \n\navistamentos; ER = 0,2 avistamentos.100km-1). As restantes esp\u00e9cies foram observadas \n\nocassionalmente resultanto em, 2 avistamentos de Grampos, um avistamento de Baleia \n\nan\u00e3 e um avistamento de Baleia de bossa. Em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 batimetria, 99,3% dos \n\navistamentos de golfinhos comuns ocorreram entre 50-200 m de profundidade. Em \n\nrela\u00e7\u00e3o ao Boto e ao Golfinho Roaz, 100% dos avistamentos ocorreram entre 50-200 m \n\nde profundidade. O declive da \u00e1rea de estudo n\u00e3o \u00e9 muito acentuado, sendo que no caso \n\ndo Golfinho Roaz e do Boto, 100% dos avistamentos ocorreram na classe de declive de 0 \n\n\u2013 80 m.km-1. Quanto ao golfinho comum 98,6% dos avistamentos ocorreram na classe de \n\ndeclive de 0 \u2013 80 m.km-1. \n\n A presen\u00e7a de crias de golfinhos comuns e roazes, foi uma constante durante o \n\nper\u00edodo amostrado. Em mais de 50% dos avistamentos de golfinhos roazes, durante o \n\nano de 2009, crias estavam presentes no grupo; em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao Golfinho comum, usou-se \n\no teste n\u00e3o param\u00e9trico Kruskal-Wallis, com um intervalo de confian\u00e7a de 95%, para \n\ncomparar as diferen\u00e7as entre os anos de 2005 a 2009 em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 presen\u00e7a/aus\u00eancia \n\nde crias. Verificou-se que existem diferen\u00e7as significativas em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao esfor\u00e7o, de ano \n\npara ano, para encontrar pelo menos um grupo com crias (H=91,6; p&lt;&lt;0,05).  \n\n O c\u00e1talogo de foto-identifica\u00e7\u00e3o de Golfinhos Comuns, iniciado no ver\u00e3o de 2009, \n\npermitiu o registo de 342 indiv\u00edduos. Ao comparar-se este cat\u00e1logo com o j\u00e1 existente \n\npara o Golfo de C\u00e1diz, com 223 indiv\u00edduos (cat\u00e1logo pertencente \u00e0 CIRC\u00c9), n\u00e3o foi \n\nregistada qualquer coincid\u00eancia de indiv\u00edduos. No entanto este resultado n\u00e3o significa \n\nque n\u00e3o possa existir fluxo de individuos entre as regi\u00f5es. A ep\u00f3ca de amostragem \u00e9 \n\nlimitada, bem como o n\u00famero de fotografias recolhidas e pass\u00edveis de usar para fins de \n\nfoto-identifica\u00e7\u00e3o. Desta forma \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio manter ambos os cat\u00e1logos em constante \n\nactualiza\u00e7\u00e3o e compara\u00e7\u00e3o. O uso de plataformas de oportunidade, barcos de Whale \n\nwatching, para a recolha de fotografias destinadas a foto-identifica\u00e7\u00e3o deve continuar e \n\nser incentivado. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n7 \n\n Apesar destes resultados apresentarem v\u00e1rias limita\u00e7\u00f5es tal como o facto de a \n\namostragem ser referente a uma pequena \u00e1rea geogr\u00e1fica da costa algarvia e \u00e0 regi\u00e3o \n\ncosteira, bem como a per\u00edodos sazonais, neste caso \u00e0 \u00e9poca de ver\u00e3o, sugerem que esta \n\n\u00e1rea pode ser particularmente interessante em termos de abund\u00e2ncia e diversidade de \n\ncet\u00e1ceos. De acordo com os mapas de distribui\u00e7\u00e3o, existe um enorme potencial de zonas \n\nde hotspot principalmente para o golfinho comum, no entanto estes resultados tamb\u00e9m \n\nrevelam a presen\u00e7a de esp\u00e9cies amea\u00e7adas tal como o Golfinho Roaz e o Boto. A \n\ndetermina\u00e7\u00e3o de hotspots para estas esp\u00e9cies, no presente estudo, \u00e9 no entanto muito \n\nlimitada uma vez que apenas se est\u00e3o a analisar dados referentes a um curto espa\u00e7o \n\ntemporal.  \n\n \u00c9 necess\u00e1rio continuar o trabalho desenvolvido, e expandi-lo a \u00e1reas mais \n\nabrangentes, quer ao longo e ao largo da costa algarvia, bem como para zonas fora da \n\nplataforma continental. Os cet\u00e1ceos s\u00e3o animais com enorme mobilidade e grande \n\ndistribui\u00e7\u00e3o. Medidas efectivas de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e estudo devem ter em conta a rela\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nentre as popula\u00e7\u00f5es e o seu habitat. Desta forma \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio perceber quais s\u00e3o os \n\nhabitats usados com maior frequ\u00eancia. O uso do habitat por parte destas esp\u00e9cies, est\u00e1 \n\nrelacionado com factores ambientais (bi\u00f3ticos e abi\u00f3ticos), tais como a disponibilidade de \n\nalimento, \u00e9pocas de reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o e acasalamento e, por exemplo, a temperatura da \u00e1gua. \n\n\u00c9 necess\u00e1rio recolher mais informa\u00e7\u00e3o, n\u00e3o s\u00f3 no Sul de Portugal, mas tamb\u00e9m em todo \n\no restante Golfo de C\u00e1diz, para se conseguir obter informa\u00e7\u00f5es de uma forma realista, \n\nrubusta e global das esp\u00e9cies e popula\u00e7\u00f5es que ocorrem nesta regi\u00e3o. \n\n \u00c9 ainda necessario ter em conta que as popula\u00e7\u00f5es de cet\u00e1ceos s\u00e3o bastante \n\nafectadas por ac\u00e7\u00f5es humanas, que, sobre elas causaram ou podem causar, efeitos \n\nnegativos, interferindo ou n\u00e3o com seus estatutos de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o. A falta de estudos e \n\nconhecimento sobre o uso de habitat por parte das esp\u00e9cies de cet\u00e1ceos na costa \n\nAlgarvia, representa um impedimento para a implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de medidas efectivas de \n\nconserva\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\n Contudo, os resultados deste trabalho sugerem que costa Sul-Oeste do Algarve \u00e9 \n\numa importante area para diferentes esp\u00e9cies de cet\u00e1ceos e apresenta o potencial para o \n\nestabelecimento de areas marinhas protegidas. \n\nPalavras chave: Sul de Portugal; Cet\u00e1ceos; Hotspots; Foto-identifica\u00e7\u00e3o; Whale \n\nwatching; Golfo de C\u00e1diz \n\n\n\n \n \n\n8 \n\nABSTRACT \n\nThe South of Portugal is one of the most popular regions in the country to observe \n\ncetaceans, although until now no studies have ever been carried out in the area. The \n\npresent work provides a first approach on the species occurring in the area between \n\nLagos and Cape S\u00e3o Vicente. \n\nUntil present, the only existing information was based on technical reports from stranding \n\nrecords, indicating the possible presence of 11 cetacean species.  \n\nThis study, based on data collected on board a whale watching platform, has the propose \n\nto investigate the species present in the area, their occurrence and spatial distribution, \n\nand the creation of a photo-id catalogue to Common dolphins. \n\nBetween 2005 and 2009, a total of 556 Common dolphin sightings was analysed resulting \n\nin an encounter rate (ER) of 2.01 sightings.100 km-1. During 2009, a total of 228 sightings \n\ncorresponding to 6 different species of cetaceans were made in the area. Among these, \n\nthe most frequent species sighted were the Short-Beaked Common dolphin (182 \n\nsightings; ER = 1.9 sightings.100km-1; the Harbour porpoise (22 sightings; ER = 0.2 \n\nsightings.100km-1, and the Atlantic Bottlenose dolphin (20 sightings; ER = 0.2 \n\nsightings.100km-1). The rest of the species, only occasionally seen, were the Risso's \n\ndolphin (2 sightings), the Minke whale and the Humpback whale (1 sighting both). The \n\nCommon dolphin photo-id catalogue started in 2009 and allows the identification of 342 \n\nindividuals. \n\nThe results obtained enable the identification of potential cetacean \u2018hotspots\u2019 in the study \n\narea, particularly concerning the Common dolphin, but also reveal the presence of \n\nendangered species, such as the Atlantic Bottlenose dolphin and the Harbour porpoise. \n\nFinally, they strongly suggest that the Southwest coast of Algarve is an important area for \n\ndifferent species of cetaceans and has the potential for the establishment of marine \n\nprotected areas. \n\n \n \n\nKeywords: South of Portugal; Cetaceans; Hotspots; Photo-identification; Whale watching; \n\nGulf of Cadiz \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n9 \n\n1. INTRODUCTION \n\n The wide diversity of cetaceans that occurres in the South Coast of the Iberia \n\nPeninsula has been the target of many studies (Verborgh et al., 2009; Stephanis et al., \n\n2008; Ca\u00f1adas, 2006). Notwithstanding,  the knowledge about the distribution and \n\nabundance of cetaceans in the Atlantic coast of the Iberia Peninsula remains very scarce, \n\nand often limited to specific areas (Brito et al., 2009; Stephanis et al., 2008; Ca\u00f1adas, \n\n2006). In Southern Portugal, this type of research, specifically directed, has not been \n\nextensively done. In fact, apart from opportunistic platforms, a systematic scientific survey \n\nwas never been conducted to quantify the occurrence of cetaceans along the coastline of \n\nmainland Portugal (Brito et al., 2009,). In last instance, most of the information about \n\ncetaceans\u2019 occurrence in Portugal has been collected through strandings\u2019 records (Silva \n\nand Sequeira, 2003). \n\nIn the Southern region of Portugal, the stranding information indicates the \n\npresence of 12 different cetacean species (Sequeira et al., 1992; Sequeira et al., 1996): \n\nthe Harbour porpoise, Phocoena phocoena (Linnaeus, 1758); the  Short-beaked Common \n\nDolphin, Delphinus delphis Linnaeus, 1758; the Atlantic Bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops \n\ntruncatus (Montagu,1821); the  Striped Dolphin, Stenella coeruleoalba (Meyen, 1833); the \n\nFalse Killer Whale, Pseudorca crassidens (Owen, 1846); the Risso's dolphin, Grampus \n\ngriseus (Cuvier, 1812); the Long-finned Pilot Whale, Globicephala melaena (Traill, 1809); \n\nthe Cuvier's Beaked Whale, Ziphius cavirostris Cuvier, 1823; the Gervais' Beaked Whale, \n\nMesoplodon europaeus (Gervais, 1855); the Fin Whale, Balaenoptera physalus \n\n(Linnaeus, 1758); the Minke Whale, Balaenoptera acutorostrata Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de, 1804; and the \n\nSei Whale, Balaenoptera borealis Lesson, 1828. There is also a report on a land sighting \n\nof a Northern Right Whale, Eubalaena glacialis (M\u00fcller, 1776) with a calf, 400 m from \n\nCape St. Vicent, Portugal (Martin and Walker 1997). \n\n The smallest and the most frequent dolphin along the coast of Portugal is the \n\nShort-beaked Common Dolphin (Delphinus delphis), while the most frequent whale is the \n\nFin Whale (Balaenoptera physalus) (Brito et al., 2009). \n\n Another important source of information comes from the whale watching \n\ncompanies. According to the tour operators established in the coast of Algarve the most \n\ncommonly encountered species are the Short-beaked Common Dolphin (Delphinus \n\ndelphis), the Atlantic Bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), the Harbour porpoise \n\n(Phocoena phocoena), the Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus), the Killer Whale, Orcinus \n\nOrca (Linnaeus, 1758), and the Minke Whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) (Mar Ilimitado, \n\nGolfinho Mar and Dolphins Driven, personal communication). The different companies \n\nconsider that the Short-beaked Common Dolphin is the most frequent species in the area, \n\n\n\n \n \n\n10 \n\nwhich, although usually found in smaller pods, can form groups that can reach hundreds \n\nof animals. The remaining species being only occasionally seen. \n\n The South Coast of Portugal is a popular area for ecotourism. In recent years, \n\nseveral companies dedicated to whale watching were created to meet the demand, and \n\nthe industry keeps expanding every year. Currently 14 companies are licensed to operate \n\nwhale watching vessels off the South Coast of Portugal (Sequeira, personal \n\ncommunication) and it is estimated that as many as 10 companies are operating without \n\nlicensure.  Each company has three boats in operation and averages three trips per boat \n\nper day. \n\n The deficient control by the national organs responsible for the control of the \n\nactivity justifies the high number of companies operating without licensure. Also, the large \n\nnumber of entities that regulate the activity, such as the Instituto de Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nNatureza e Biodiversidade, the Turismo de Portugal, the Turismo de Natureza and the \n\nInstituto Portu\u00e1rio e dos Transportes, leads to doubts between the operators, due to the \n\ndifferences in information provided by each entity. Apart from that, the poor control may \n\nalso be due to the fact that, in this area, there is a considerable paucity of data. \n\n Besides that, most of the companies do not have staff with specific formation in \n\norder to be able to provide the public with proper information about the species and the \n\noperators lack the resources needed to provide the public with current scientific \n\ninformation regarding cetaceans. Ecotourism must include education, environmental \n\nawareness, and conservation components to provide a meaningful bridge between the \n\npublic and the science. \n\n The fact that whale-watching boats are nowadays regularly used as \u201cplatforms of \n\nopportunity\u201d by scientists for mark-recapture studies has contributed to diminish this \n\nproblem. \n\n The proposed scheme will utilize the whale-watching boats and crew to collect the \n\ndata (Photo-ID) combining whale-watch tours with scientific research (Verborgh et al., \n\n2009; Wittich, 2009).  \n\n Further, systematically planed studies are critical to better understand the \n\ndistribution, abundance and occurrence of cetaceans in this area. New guidelines for \n\nwhale watching in the South of Portugal are also critical for effective long term \n\nmanagement. When thinking about conservation measures for cetaceans, it is necessary \n\nto identify the species, the various populations and estimate their abundance, habitat use \n\nand spatial distribution. It is also important, whenever possible, to have information on \n\ntheir diet and natural history (Ca\u00f1adas, 2006). \n\n Marine mammals are often referred to as charismatic mega fauna: people care \n\nabout them more than other species or groups, and that contributes to the conservation of \n\n\n\n \n \n\n11 \n\nentire ecosystems (Reynolds et al., 2009). In fact, several efforts have been made in order \n\nto protect marine mammals and their habitats, as shown by the considerable number of \n\ninternational conventions, laws and organizations devoted to the subject. Portugal, both \n\nas an independent country and as member of the European Union, is a party of most of \n\nthese conventions and agreements, and therefore has the duty to follow the guidelines \n\nsuggested.    \n\n The present study intends to characterize the cetacean\u2019s fauna occurring in the \n\narea between Cape S\u00e3o Vicente and Lagos, a region chosen because of the lack of \n\nstudies on the subject. \n\nThe study will attempt to answer the following questions: \n\na) Which species occur in the area? \n\nb) What is the encounter rate and abundance index for each species? \n\nc) What is the spatial distribution of the different species with relation to the \n\nbathymetric features of the Cape S\u00e3o Vicente area? \n\nAnd to create a Photo-Id catalogue for common dolphins. \n\n Despite having obtained data for several species of cetaceans during the time of \n\nthis study, this work will focus especially, on the common dolphin, the Bottlenose dolphin \n\nand the Harbour porpoise, and intends to be an initial step into the cetaceans\u2019 \n\ninvestigation in the area, and serve as a baseline for future works. \n\n2. STUDY AREA \n\n The south coast of Portugal belongs to the Algarve region. It includes \n\napproximately 160 km, from Sagres to the Guadiana river mouth (Alveirinho Dias, 1988). \n\nThe continental platform is very short, varying between 7 km and 28 km wide (Magalh\u00e3es, \n\n2001 and Marques, 1982), with 17 km as the average value (Lopes &amp; Cunha, 2010). The \n\nslope is soft and well defined, located at an average depth of 110 m to 150 m. It has 2500 \n\nkm2 inside the bathymetric depth of 200 m. The morphology reflects a geological evolution \n\ncontrolled by tectonic and sedimentary dynamics similar to other regions of the Gulf of \n\nCadiz (Lopes &amp; Cunha, 2010). \n\n The currents on the Algarve platform region are generally weak. Drift currents \n\npredominate. The drift current adapt to the coastal profile, moving parallel to the coast in \n\nboth directions, near the 30 m isobathymetric line.  Currents reach speeds nearly 50 cm.s-\n\n1 in extreme cases, although it typically flows below 25 .s-1 (Magalh\u00e3es, 2001). \n\n\n\n \n \n\n12 \n\n The tides have a half-day regime and an average amplitude of 2 m (maximum: 3,5 \n\nm: minimum: 0,5 m) (Falc\u00e3o et al., 2003). \n\n The average wave energy is considered low along the coast line, with seasonal \n\nvariations, rising in winter following to rough weather. The result is an increase in beach \n\nerosion (Dolbeth et al., 2006). \n\n The 10 m and the 20 m isobathymetric lines follow the coast line with considerable \n\nregularity (Costa and Franca, 1982). The hydrologic characteristics, such has The salinity, \n\nthe pH and the temperature are considerably uniform. The salinity is nearly constant all \n\nyear, varying between 36.1 and 36.3 at surface and 36.1 to 36.4 at a depth of 50 m . The \n\ntemperatures peak between July and August and reach minimum values between January \n\nand February (Ricardo, 2009). \n\n Another characteristic of the coast of Algarve is the presence of submarine \n\ncanyons and trenches, which facilitate the flow of the water masses and sedimentary load \n\n(Lopes &amp; Cunha, 2010). The most important canyons are the Lagos canyon, the Portim\u00e3o \n\ncanyon, the Albufeira canyon, the Faro canyon and the S\u00e3o Vicente canyon. Regarding \n\nthe trenches it is relevant to refer the Diogo C\u00e3o trench and the \u00c1lvares Cabral trench. \n\nThis study focuses on the area between Lagos and Cabo S\u00e3o Vicente (Fig 1) which has \n\nthe western conditions and characteristics, also part of this area is inserted in the Natural \n\nPark, Parque Natural do Sudoeste Alentejano e Costa Vicentina.  \n\n \nFigure 1. Location of the study area. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n13 \n\n The S\u00e3o Vicente canyon has substantial influence in this area. It is located in the \n\nGulf of Cadiz (GoC), in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean, off SW Iberia. The GoC is located \n\nbetween the Straits of Gibraltar (5\u00baW) and the Gorringe Bank (12\u00baW) between 34\u00baN and \n\n38\u00baN (Valadares et al., 2009). The canyon has a general staircase-like shape with the \n\nupper and lower parts trending NE-SW and the middle sector with an NNE-SSW direction \n\n(Valadares et al., 2009). The S\u00e3o Vicente canyon head lies very close to the shore, at \n\ndepths shallower than 70 m and runs towards the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain at an \n\napproximate depth of 4900 m. It extends for more than 120 km, being the larger \n\nsubmarine canyon on the GoC, reaching up to 20 km in width (Valadares et al., 2009). \n\nTide-topography interaction along a submarine canyon is able to enhance mixing, \n\nproviding a cross shelf eddy flux of salt. Vertically forced tidal currents advect salty waters \n\nfrom the bottom of the canyon to its head, where mixing takes place. Differences in \n\nsalinity between up and down canyon tidal currents produce an eddy flux of salt (Vargas-\n\nY\u00e1\u00f1ez et al., 2002). \n\n \"Meddies\" (Mediterranean eddies) are warm, salty eddies of Mediterranean water \n\ngenerated by instabilities in the water flowing from Gibraltar. The Cape S\u00e3o Vicente is a \n\ngeneration site for meddies by a mechanism of separation of the frictional boundary layer \n\nat these sharp corners (Serra &amp; Ambar, 2000). Eddies are responsible for upwelling \n\nphenomenon, generating richer waters at the surface (Alan E. Burger, 2003; Lee et al., \n\n1999). Eddies also contribute to the upwelling with warmer waters generated by spring-\n\nsummer winds (Baringer &amp; Price, 1997). Because of these characteristics, the S\u00e3o \n\nVicente canyon has great influence on marine life around Sagres, helping to increase the \n\nproductivity of these waters and supporting a considerable biodiversity. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n14 \n\n3. STUDIED SPECIES \n\n The basic knowledge about the species that are the object of the present study will \n\nhelp to better understand their distribution, habitat use and dynamics. \n\n \n\nThe Short-beaked Common dolphin, Delphinus delphis Linnaeus, 1758: \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2. Short-beaked Common dolphin in the South of Portugal (photo by Joana Castro). \n\n \n\nUntil today, two species of Common dolphin are recognised worldwide: the short-beaked \n\n(Delphinus delphis) and the long-beaked (D. capensis), with a subspecies of the long-\n\nbeaked (D. capensis tropicalis) also acknowledged. This consideration of two species is \n\nbased on the morphological difference which has been supported by genetic analysis, that \n\nshows considerable differences in the mitochondrial DNA between both forms (Rosel et \n\nal., 1994), which suggests that they have been separated for a long time and probably do \n\nnot interbreed, despite living in sympatry. On the other hand, some authors consider that \n\nonly one species exists, Delphinus delphis, and that the others are geographic forms or \n\nsubspecies (Ca\u00f1adas, 2006).  \n\n Even though this species is very widespread in most of the European waters, there \n\nare many aspects of common dolphin biology and ecology, including abundance, \n\ndistribution and taxonomy that remain unclear (ECS 2004). \n\n The Short-beaked Common dolphin is a small cetacean with a very wide \n\ndistribution (Bearzi et al., 2003). This distribution it is not panmictic and can be found in \n\nseries of geographically separated populations (Heyning &amp; Perrin, 1994; Perrin &amp; \n\nBrownell, 1994; Jefferson &amp; Van Waerebeek, 2002). Studies on the abundance and \n\ndistribution of cetaceans are not easy, particularly concerning species like common \n\ndolphins, with a world hide range, different habitat types (Hammond et al. 2002, Lopez \n\n\n\n \n \n\n15 \n\n2003, Silva and Sequeira 2003) and both long term and short term movements \n\n(Northridge et al., 2004; Brereton et al., 2005). \n\n The average size of an adult Common dolphin is approximately 2 m in length, with \n\nmales slightly larger than females (Evans 1987). Adults\u2019 weight varies between 75 - 85 kg, \n\nwith a maximum 136 kg (Evans 1987; Evans 1994). Pregnancy is estimated to be 10-11.5 \n\nmonths (Evans 1987; Perrin and Reilly 1984; Murphy 2004) and the calves are born with \n\n80 cm to 90 cm in length (Evans 1987; Evans 1994).  \n\n In relation to predators, it is known that cetaceans have very few of them, although \n\nthe main predators are sharks, Killer whales, False Killer whales and Man (Perrin et al., \n\n2002). In the South of Portugal, there is a anecdotical evidence showing that the presence \n\nof Killer Whales (Orcinus orca) and False Killer (Pseudorca crassidens) is very rare, which \n\nis why the predators of dolphins here can be reduced to sharks and the Man (direct or \n\naccidental death). \n\n \n \n\nHarbour porpoise, Phocoena phocoena (Linnaeus, 1758) \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3. Harbour porpoise in the South of Portugal (photo by Joana Castro). \n\n \n \n\n The Harbour or Common porpoise, Phocoena phocoena (Linnaeus 1758), is one \n\nof six species recognised in the family Phocoenidae (Read 1999). It is the smallest \n\ncetacean that occurs in the Atlantic Ocean (Sequeira, 1988) and in European waters \n\n(Watson, 1985). On average, the size of an adult is around 150 cm to 160 cm and the \n\nweight 45 kg to 60 kg (Gaskin et al., 1974). In the North Sea the maximum size for males \n\nand females was 170 cm (55 kg) and 171 cm (55.5 kg), respectively (Lockyer 1995; \n\nSantos et al., 2001a; Santos and Pierce, 2003). Nevertheless, the information from \n\nstrandings in the northwest Spain and Portugal shows that Harbour porpoises in these \n\nareas seem to be larger, around 200 cm (Donovan &amp; Bj\u00f8rge 1995; Sequeira 1996). \n\n\n\n \n \n\n16 \n\n Harbour porpoises are widespread in coastal waters of the Northern Hemisphere \n\nand in temperate and subarctic waters in the North Atlantic and North Pacific (Santos and \n\nPierce, 2003). Although this was once the most common of the cetaceans in European \n\nwaters, it has suffered a serious decline, between 53,000 and 89,000 animals, in the last \n\ncentury (Reijinders, 1992). The species is listed in the Appendix II of CITES and The Red \nList Category and Criteria for Harbour porpoise is \u201cLeast Concern\u201d (www.iucnredlist.org). \n\n In continental Portugal, the first records of Harbour porpoises were made in the \n\n19th century, and indicate that this species was very abundant (Bocage in Sequeira 1988; \n\nNobre in Sequeira 1988). In late 1970s the records indicate a decrease in the amount of \n\nanimals, only seen occasionally and moving alone or in small groups (Teixeira in Sequeira \n\n1988). Nowadays most of the information about this species in mainland Portugal comes \n\nfrom stranding records along the coastline, and that is how the abundance and \n\noccurrence have been estimated. \n\n \n \nAtlantic Bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus (Montagu, 1821) \n \n\n \nFigure 4. Atlantic Bottlenose dolphin in the South of Portugal (photo by Joana Castro). \n\n \n The Bottlenose dolphin is distributed worldwide, showing such an extraordinary \n\nadaptation to the diverse conditions in different regions that it is difficult to define fixed \n\ncharacteristics for the species\u2019 feeding habits, behaviour or social structure (Ca\u00f1adas \n\n2004). \n\n Tursiops is a polytypic genus (Hershkovitz 1966). There are a lot of different \n\nmorphotypes that differ in coloration pattern, body measures and cranial structure (Walter \n\n1981; Ross and Cockcroft 1990). These differences arise controversy among scientists, \n\nand some consider there are more than 20 different species belonging to the genus \n\nTursiops (Hershkovitz 1966; Ross 1977; Walter 1981; Ross and Cockcroft 1990). As most \n\n\n\n \n \n\n17 \n\nof the distribution of these characters generally overlaps (Walter 1981; Ross and \n\nCockcroft 1990), Tursiops truncatus was considered as a single species by many experts \n\n(Ross and Cockcroft 1990; Wilson and Reeder 1993) until molecular data supported the \n\nseparation of Tursiops aduncus as a different species (LeDuc et al., 1999; Wang et al., \n\n1999). \n\n Studies done in different areas of distribution revealed two distinct morphotypes: \n\nthe coastal morphotype and the offshore morphotype (Ross 1977, 1984; Walter 1981; \n\nPerrin, 1982; Leatherwood and Reeves, 1983; Duffield et al., 1983; Ross and Cockroft \n\n1990; Van Waerebeek et al., 1990; Mead and Potter 1995; Torres et al., 2003). According \n\nto Perrin (1982) this distinction is related to and based on morphologic aspects, such as \n\nnumber of teeth and the robustness of the jaw, which might be connected with the type of \n\ndiet and habitat. Mean adult length ranges between 2.5 m and 3.8 m (Mead and Potter, \n\n1990; Read et al., 1993).  These sizes have great variability, especially when both \n\nmorphotypes described are compared, the coastal being rather smaller than the offshore \n\none (Perrin et al., 2002). Coloration is a more or less uniform dark grey body with white \n\nbelly. In general Tursiops truncatus is more robust than the other small delphinids, the \n\ncommon dolphin or the striped dolphin for example (Ca\u00f1adas 2004). Bottlenose dolphins \n\nreach sexual maturity at the age of 8-12 years in males and 5-10 years in females \n\n(Reynolds et al., 2000). The gestation period is about 12 months and the lactation period \n\ngoes from 12 to 20 months (Perrin et al., 2002; Reynolds et al., 2000). \n\n Tursiops truncatus is an opportunistic species, feeding on the most abundant prey \n\n(Sequeira, 1988), and feeds mainly on demersal species (Gunter 1942; Tomilin 1957; \n\nEvans 1987; Barros and Odell 1990; Gannier 1995). In the Atlantic waters of Portugal and \n\nGalicia, the analysis of stomach contents indicates that 99% of the diet is composed by \n\nfish, with the Gadidae, and especiallythe blue whiting, as main prey items, (Santos et al., \n\n1996; Silva and Sequeira 1997).  \n\n Bottlenose dolphins have a very cosmopolitan distribution. The species is \n\nwidespread in the world\u2019s temperate and tropical oceans, occupying most marine habitats \n\nexcept the polar zones (Leatherwood and Reeves, 1983; Klinowska, 1991; Wilson et al., \n\n1999). In continental Portugal, several studies were made on a resident population at the \n\nSado Estuary (dos Santos, M. E. and Lacerda, 1987; Gaspar, R. 1994; Freitas, A. 1995; \n\nBrito, C. 2001), but there is a lack of knowledge about this species in relation to the \n\ndistribution, population, and habitat use in other areas of continental Portugal. The only \n\ninformation found related to the south of Portugal belongs to SEC (Sociedad Espanola de \n\nCet\u00e1ceos), which conducted an expedition in the Gulf of Cadiz and Portuguese waters in \n\n2004, and only sighted one Bottlenose dolphin in Portuguese waters.  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n18 \n\nOther Species \n\n Minke whales, Balaenoptera acutorostrata Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de, 1804, are the smallest and \nmost abundant of the roquals. The species can be found in all the world\u2019s oceans, having \n\na large and cosmopolitan distribution (Perrin et al., 2002). Minke whales are considered \n\nmore frequently distributed near shore than in open ocean (Tetley 2004), often associated \nwith coastal habitats or ice edge areas (Kasamatsu et al., 2002). Most of the information \n\nabout the occurrence of this species in Portugal comes from strandings (Sequeira et al., \n\n1992; Sequeira et al., 1996). \n\n Humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae (Borowski, 1781) are known for their \n\nwide distribution and long migrations, with several instances of 8000 km migration \n\nreported (e.g. Stone et al., 1990; Darling et al., 1996; Stevick et al., 1999), though details \n\nof these migrations are poorly known. (Stevick et al., 2003). In the Mediterranean Sea this \n\nspecies has always been considered extremely rare (Aguilar, 1989; Notarbartolo di Sciara \n\nand Demma, 1997), but since 1990 the number of sightings has increased (Frantzis et al., \n\n2004). In mainland Portugal, most information on the occurrence of humpback whales \n\ncomes from the strandings (Sequeira et al., 1992; Sequeira et al., 1996). \n\n Risso\u2019s dolphin, Grampus griseus (Cuvier, 1812), is a species with a large \n\ndistribution. It can be found in all the oceans: in the Pacific, from the Kuril Islands and the \n\nSoutheast of Alaska, to New Zealand and Chile; in the Atlantic, from the Newfoundland \n\nand the Scottish Shetland Islands to Argentina and South Africa; in the Indian, from the \n\nsouth of South Africa to the South of Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand. It is also \n\nfound in the Red Sea (Evans, 1987). Usually individuals of this species occur in offshore \n\nareas, although in the Atlantic it is frequent to observe small groups close to shore on the \n\nWest coast of Africa, Atlantic islands (Cape Verde, Canarias and Azores) and on the \n\nEuropean coast (Mainland Portugal, Golf of Biscay, West coast of Ireland and Scotland) \n\n(Evans, 1987). \n\n There are records of the occurrence of this species near mainland Portugal since \n\n1924 (Chaves, 1924). Nowadays, in the Azores it is considered a very common species \n\n(Silva et al., 2003), though in mainland Portugal there are few records. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n19 \n\n4. METHODOLOGY \n\n4.1. Data Collection \u2013 Survey and Sightings \n\n4.1.1. Field data collection \n\nA whale watching boat from the company, Mar Ilimitado, operating in Sagres was \n\nused as an opportunistic platform in this study. This company conducts three trips a day, \n\nwith a single vessel boat. Carrying capacity includes 12 passengers, one skipper and one \n\nguide. The average duration of each trip is 90 minutes. \n\n Data from sightings of common dolphins (between 2005 and 2009) and Bottlenose \n\ndolphins and Harbour porpoises (during 2009), were analysed. \n\n The transepts made by the company were random tracks, with any pre-defined \n\npath. \n\n Since a platform of opportunity was used in this work, several limitations are to be \n\nconsidered with this kind of survey: time spent with the animals, the approach of the boat, \n\nthe velocity during effort, and the duration of each trip. \n\n All trips used in this study were approximately 1h 30 min, but the number of trips \n\nper day was variable according to the availability of tourists and meteorological conditions. \n\nDuring the surveys a continuous effort was made at all times, only stopping when a group \n\nof cetaceans were approached. In most of the trips two observers searched for the \n\nanimals covering an 180\u00ba angle ahead of the vessel. \n\n The sighting effort was measured as the number of kilometres travelled searching \n\nfor cetaceans. The position of the boat was recorded during all trips by a GPS (Global \n\nPosition System), creating the track for each trip. \n\n Data between 2005 and 2009 were collected by the employees of the whale-\n\nwatching company and, although the company\u2019s database included different data \n\nparameters, depending on the observer responsible for collecting the data, several of \n\nthem, such as the GPS track, the GPS position of the animals, date, species sighted, \n\nnumber of individuals, presence or absence of calves, group cohesion and environmental \n\ndata (sea state, wind speed, visibility) were consistent across all years. From 15th of June \n\nto 30th of September 2009 the following data were systematically collected: GPS track, \n\ndate, species, GPS position, distance from the boat, angle, the initial cue, initial behaviour, \n\ncontact behaviour, final behaviour, response of the animal to the boat, cohesion of the \n\ngroup, number of individuals, number of adults, juveniles, calves and newborns, direction \n\nof travel of the animal, and information on the number of boats present in a circle of 300m. \n\nEnvironmental data, such as depth, water temperature, visibility, wind direction, Beaufort, \n\nsea state and swell were also collected. Although all these information were collected, \n\n\n\n \n \n\n20 \n\nonly the GPS track, the GPS position, date, species, number of individuals, presence or \n\nabsence of calves, and group cohesion will be analysed in the present work. \n For purposes of data analysis, the study area was divided into quadrats using a \n\ngrid with a cell resolution of 2 min latitude (3704 m) by 2 min longitude (3006 m), using \n\nArcGIS 9.3. This scale was used in order make the results comparable to those of \n\nprevious studies and with future research programs carried out by CIRC\u00c9 (Conservation, \n\nInformation &amp; Research on Cetaceans). Following de Stephanis et al., (2008), only the \n\ncells with a sighting effort of at least 3 km were used in the analyses. \n\n For each cell the total of km (effort for each cell), the total number of sightings, and \n\nthe total number of animals sighted was calculated.  \n\n4.1.2. Presence and relative abundance of cetaceans \n\n To quantify the cetaceans\u2019 relative abundance three parameters were used: \n\n1 \u2013 The Encounter Rate (ER) (sightings km-1), the number of sightings of a given species \n\nper 100 km of effort: ER = (Sightings/Effort) x 100. \n\n2 \u2013 The abundance rate (AR) (ind. km-1) defined as the number of individuals of a given \n\nspecies over the effort in the research area in km: AI = (Individuals/Effort) x 100. \n\n3 - Density Estimation (using \u201cKernel Density Estimation\u201d, a statistical tool from ArcGIS \n\n(Hawth\u2019s Tools)) (Beyer, H. L. 2004), a non-parametric way of estimating the probability \n\ndensity function of a random variable. For example, given some data about a sample of a \n\npopulation, this analysis extrapolates the data to the entire population. Kernel Density \n\nEstimation was calculated for Delphinus delphis between the years of 2005 - 2009. For \n\nTursiops truncatus and Phocoena phocoena only the year of 2009 was used. \n\n The Kernel tool was run using both ER and AI per cell as a weighting factor. If a \n\nsighting fell inside a cell with less than 3 km effort, a weight of 1 was attributed, making \n\nthe point neutral to the analysis (Beyer, H. L. 2004).  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n21 \n\n4.1.3. Spatial distribution and bathymetry \n\n Two bathymetric features were used, the depth and slope. The mean depth and \n\nslope were calculated for each quadrat. Depth data were obtained from the Portuguese \n\nhydrographic institute (Instituto Hidrogr\u00e1fico - http://www.hidrografico.pt/dowload-\n\ngratuito.php). From this data we created a TIN (Triangulated irregular network) in order to \n\nget the slope (a raster with a resolution of 100x100 m) and then, each cell assumed as \n\nbathymetric gradient the maximum slope and the mean depth. \n\n The distribution of cetaceans according to depth and slope was made based on a \n\ncontinuous depth and slope data set, the mean values of quadrats. Depth and slope were \n\nranked into subjective categories to provide a pertinent ecological context for the \n\ninterpretation of the results (Figs. 19, 20 and 21; Table V). \n\n Depth was categorised according to the diving capabilities of the observed \n\ncetaceans and the minimum and maximum depths in the study area: 50\u2013100 m, 100\u2013150 \n\nm, 150\u2013200 m and ? 200 m.  \n\n The slope was categorised as follows: 0 \u201380 m.km-1, 80\u2013160 m.km-1, 160\u2013240 \n\nm.km-1 and ? 240 m.km-1. \n\n \n\n \n4.1.4. Social organization: group size, group cohesion and presence or \n\nabsence of calves \n\n The group size was obtained by the minimum and maximum values of the \nencountered groups per species. In 2009 the group cohesion was calculated to all species \n\n(Table I). \n \n \nTable I - Classifications of group cohesion \n\nD = dispersed (> 5 bodies)\n\nC = compact (1-5 bodies)\n\nVC = very compact (&lt;1 body)\n\nL = lone individual\n\nNI = not identifiable\n\nGroup Cohesion\n\n \n\n \n The presence or absence of calves was analysed based on the data for two \n\nspecies: Delphinus delphis and Tursiops truncatus. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n22 \n\n For Tursiops truncatus, the total number of sightings was considered, and the \n\npresence (Pr), absence (Ab) or the incapacity to identify the presence or absence of \n\ncalves (not identifiable - NI) in each sighting, during 2009, were analysed. \n\n Concerning Delphinus delphis, the data was tested for normality and \n\nhomoscedasticity and, given the results, the non parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, with a \n\n95% confidence interval, was used to compare the differences in the presence of calves \n\namong different years (2005-2009) using the groups in which it was possible to determine \n\nthis variable. The Dunn test was used for pairwise testing. \n\n4.2. Data Collection - Photo-ID \n\n Photo-identification (Photo-ID) is a methodology that uses photographs of long-\n\nterm natural marks, such as nicks and notches on the dolphins\u2019 dorsal fins (W\u00fcrsig and \n\nJefferson 1990; Bearzi et al., 2005) as well as scars and pigmentation patterns \n\n(Hammond et al., 1990; Auger-M\u00e9th\u00e9 and Whitehead 2007) to identify individuals. Photo-\n\nID methodology has several advantages, such as the fact that it is a non-invasive and \n\ninexpensive technique, allowing extensive use in cetacean studies (Hammond et al., \n\n1990; Auger-M\u00e9th\u00e9 and Whitehead 2007). \n\nDuring the present study photos were taken with a Nikon D200 camera using 18-\n\n200mm and 70-300mm lenses, between 15th June and 30th September 2009, on board a \n\nwhale watching boat belonging to the company Mar Ilimitado. \n\nAll species encountered were photographed, but Common dolphins (Delphinus \n\ndelphis) were the only ones included in the catalogue, which is the first catalogue \n\ndeveloped for common dolphins in the south coast of continental Portugal. \n\n All pictures were catalogued and each individual was attributed a code of the form \n\nDD_ALG_XXXX, where DD stands for Delphinus delphis, ALG for Algarve (the region of \n\nthe study) and XXXX  the number assigned to the particular individual in the catalogue \n\n(ex: DD_ALG_0001). The catalogue was handmade, with no Photo-ID program used. In \n\nthe identification nicks and notches in the dorsal fin were used (W\u00fcrsig and Jefferson \n\n1990), as well as body scars and pigmentation patterns (Lockyer and Morris 1990).  \n\n Each picture was analyzed and the data information was organized in a Microsoft \n\nEXCEL datasheet. The data consisted of basic information such as: sighting number, \n\npicture number, number of individuals in the picture, number of the individual analysed in \n\nthe picture (starting from the closest individual to the furthest and from left to right when \n\ntwo animals were at the same distance), date of the picture, angle, individual quality, and \n\ncode name of the individual. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n23 \n\n The angle of the picture starts in 0\u00b0 when the animal is photographed directly from \n\nthe front and goes around the animal clockwise every 30\u00b0 (Fig. 5).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5. Photo-id angles. \n\n \n \n In each picture, each individual was attributed a quality rating (Q) on a scale from 0 \n\nto 2 (poor to excellent) based on five characteristics: focus, size, orientation, exposure, \n\nand the percentage of the fin visible in the frame (Table II).  \n\nFor the purpose of the catalogue only the best quality pictures (Q1 and Q2) (Table \n\nII) were used. \n\n \n\n \nTable II - Quality rating for photos used in photo-id process \n\nQuality rating (Q) Description \n\nQ0\nUnusable individual dorsal fin: blurred, too far away \nor if the angle is between 330\u00ba and 30\u00ba or 150\u00ba and \n210\u00ba (Fig. 6)\n\nQ1 Medium quality representation of part of the fin or \nthe entire dorsal fin (Fig.7)\n\nQ2 High quality representation of the entire dorsal fin (Fig.8)\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n24 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Following the conditions stated above, a catalogue of the dorsal fins from both the \n\nleft and the right side was created. \n\n This catalogue was compared with that of the Gulf of Cadiz (belonging to CIRC\u00c9), \n\nthe closest population to the study area, to see if there were any matches. Only the left \n\nside catalogue was considered in this process because there is only a left side catalogue \n\nfor the Gulf of Cadiz.  \n\nPhoto 4 - Photo Q0 Photo 1 - Photo Q1 \n\nPhoto 6 - Photo Q2 \n\nFigure 6.

Bathymetry and Slope  \n\n The number of sightings per 100 km of effort was considered relative to depth and \n\nslope.  \n\n Concerning depth, and since there are no sightings in zones shallower than 50 m \n\ndeep, the class between 50 m and 100 m was considered as the first class. It was in this \n\nclass that most of sightings were made for all species found. In the last class, ? 200 m, \n\nthe number of sightings was very small. \n\n The slope was characterised adopting the categories of Piatt et al., (2006) from 0 \n\nto 80 m.km-1, 80 to 160 m.km-1, 160 to 240 m.km-1and ? 240 m.km-1. The slope in the \n\nstudy area is not very marked and most of the sightings were made between 0 m.km-1 and \n\n80 m.km-1. \n\n For Common dolphins, data from 2005 \u2013 2009 was considered. Analysing the data \n\nfrom depth, it was in the first class that most of sightings were made but it was in the last \n\none that a higher ER was found (Fig.19). Considering the slope, most of the sightings \n\nwere made between 0 to 80 m.km-1 (Table V). \n\n \n\nCommon Dolphin 2005 - 2009\n\n0\n50\n\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n400\n450\n500\n\n[50 - 100[ [100 - 150[ [150 - 200[ ?200\n\nDepth (m)\n\nN\no\n\n. \nSi\n\ngh\nti\n\nn\ngs\n\n0,00\n1,00\n2,00\n3,00\n4,00\n5,00\n6,00\n7,00\n8,00\n9,00\n10,00\n11,00\n12,00\n13,00\n\nER\n\n \nFigure 19.

DISCUSSION \n\n6.1.Spatial distribution, abundance and social organization of \ncetaceans \n\nCommon dolphin (Delphinus delphis) \n\n The maps of the density and occurrence of Common dolphins during 2005-2009 in \n\nthe study area can be seen in fig 10 e 11 showing that there are no big differences \n\nbetween the use of the AI or the ER as factor of weight in the Kernel analysis, revealing \n\nthat the areas of more encounters are also the areas where the animals are more \n\nabundant.  \n\nMost of the sampling was done during the summer time, and the animals were found very \n\nclose to shore, 7438,01m in average (Fig 9). \n Common dolphins occur in most coasts of the world, and mainly in the continental \n\nshelf but can be found in all depth ranges (Evans, 1994; Forcada and Hammond, 1998; \n\nPeddemors, 1999; Ca\u00f1adas et al., 2002). In this study, 552 sightings of common dolphins, \n\ncorresponding to 99.3%, were made over the continental shelf, in a range of 50-200 m \n\ndeep, although, 80.2% of the sightings were made between 50-100 m deep, in very \n\nshallow waters. Only 4 sightings occurred in areas deeper than 200 m (Fig 19). These \n\nresults agree with previous studies, suggesting that this specie is more frequent in shallow \n\nwaters (Ca\u00f1adas et al., 2002) \n\n Although most of the sightings were made in shallow waters, we can see an \n\nincrease of the ER with the increase of depth (Fig 19). In fact, the lowest ER corresponds \n\nto the region of higher number of sightings, in the most shallow waters range. This is \n\npossible, due to the fact that most of the survey effort was done in shallow waters. \n\nTherefore, and even with few sightings in deeper areas, since the survey effort (km) was \n\nsmaller, this will result in higher ER. A similar situation happens with the slope results, \n\nwere 98.6% of the sightings were made in the slope class of [0-80[, corresponding to the \n\nlowest ER, 3,49 (Table V). To better understand how this animals use deeper waters, it \n\nwould be really interesting to do surveys out of the continental shelf, and also during the \n\nwinter time, since most of the data was collected during the summer time. It is known that \n\nCommon dolphins have differences in distribution and density in relation to the season \n\nvariations (Ca\u00f1adas 2006). \n The Common dolphin is considered a very opportunistic species in terms of \n\nfeeding habits (Klinowska 1991; Young and Cockcroft 1994; Gannier 1995). So it is to \n\nexpect that the distribution and abundance of the animals is strictly related with the \n\nabundance and distribution of prey (Ca\u00f1adas 2006).  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n45 \n\n According to previous studies (Silva and Sequeira, 2003; Santos et al., 2004), it \n\nseems that the main prey for common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) in the Portuguese \n\nwaters is the sardine (Sardina pilchardus). In this study this covariate was not available. \n\nTherefore, further studies need to be done taking into account the presence and \n\nabundance of common dolphins with the abundance and distribution of their main prey, in \n\nthis case the sardine.  \n\n In relation to social organization, common dolphin is described as a very \n\ngregarious species, which can form groups of several hundreds or even thousands of \n\nanimals (Evans 1994; Evans 1994; Leatherwood et al., 1988). Nevertheless, published \n\ndata show a basic social unit between 20 to 30 animals (Evans 1994). Our results agree \n\nwith this, since in most of the sightings, between the years 2005-2009, the size of the \n\ngroups observed varied between 1 and 25 individuals (Fig 22). As in most highly \n\ngregarious species with very little sexual dimorphism, almost nothing is known about the \n\nsex/age composition of the groups and their social organisation (Ca\u00f1adas 2006).  \n\n The presence or absence of calves interferes with the preference of habitats. For \n\nexample groups with calves are known to prefer costal waters than deeper waters \n\n(Ca\u00f1adas 2006). In our results calves were present in more than 50% of the groups in \n\nwhich they were possible to be determined. It is important to emphasize, that most of the \n\ndata was collected during summer season (June \u2013 October), when supposedly the birth \n\nseason takes place, and thus it was expected to register a high percentage of groups with \n\ncalves.  \n\n Although some authors mentioned that even if the reproduction season of this \n\nspecies is not well defined, it seems that according to the area there might be more than \n\none peak of maximum conception (Ca\u00f1adas 2006). These peaks are usually extrapolated \n\nfrom the months of maximum proportion of births (Ca\u00f1adas 2006). In the North Atlantic \n\nthe maximum peak is estimated in summer (July to October) (Ca\u00f1adas 2006; Evans \n\n1987). According to Gannier (1995) in the Mediterranean, it is also estimated the summer, \n\nto be the season with maximum conception.  \n\n Although the effort necessary to encounter groups with calves continuously \n\ndecreased along the years, suggesting an increase in the number of calves (Fig.24), we \n\nbelieve that other reasons are influencing these results. The data from 2005 until 2008 \n\nwas collected by the guides of the whale watching company which started the activity in \n\n2005. Therefore along these years the methodology has been improved and the data \n\ncollected getting more consistent. In 2009 the data was collected by a conducted marine \n\nmammal observer (MMO). This could explain why the clear decrease in the effort rate \n\nmay not really be related with the fact that are more calves every year, but instead with \n\nthe fact that the data was collected in a more consisted away. It is possible to observe that \n\n\n\n \n \n\n46 \n\nthe differences between 2008 and 2009 are not significant, which corresponds to 4 years \n\nof improving the data collected by the company and one year with a directed MMO. \n\n Nevertheless these results strongly suggest the presence of calves during the \n\nsummer season, indicating that this could be an important area for the reproduction of \n\ncommon dolphins. Notwithstanding, more conducted studies are needed, to better confirm \n\nthis hypothesis. \n\n From 2005 until 2009 there was a large increase in the number of sightings of \n\ncommon dolphins, from 39 to 182 (Table III). This situation is related to the fact that the \n\ncompany increases the number of trips per year, which brings an increase in the survey \n\neffort (Table III). These results are extremely interesting, since a total ER of 2,01 was \n\nobtained, specially when comparing this result with the one estimated for the closest \n\nstudied population, occurring in the Strait of Gibraltar (ER = 2,29), where common \n\ndolphins are known to be very abundant (de Stephanis et al., 2008). Therefore we can \n\nassume that the study area can be an important zone for distribution and abundance of \n\ncommon dolphins in the South of Portugal.  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n47 \n\nHarbour porpoise (Phocena phocena) \n\n The results concerning this species provide a new insight into the abundance and \n\noccurrence of the Harbour porpoise in the study area. According to the 2005 SCANS \u2013 II \n\nproject, which had the goal of estimating small cetacean abundance in the North Sea and \n\nEuropean Atlantic continental shelf waters, there were no sightings of Harbour porpoises \n\nin the South part of Portugal, and only a few sightings in the North of the country. This fact \n\nmakes these results extremely interesting, suggesting that this area might be more used \n\nby this species than what was expected and known (Table IV). Also, this area is probably \n\none of the few, where whale watching occurs and Harbour porpoises are present. The \n\nmaps of the density and occurrence seen in figures 13 and 14 show that there are no \n\nlarge differences between using the AI or the ER as weight factors in the Kernel analysis, \n\nrevealing that the areas of more encounters are also the areas where the animals are \n\nmore abundant.  \n\n Most sampling was done during summertime, and the animals were found \n\nreasonably close to the shore, 5873.91 m on average (Fig. 12). \n\n Harbour porpoises are known to have seasonal variation in which near-shore \n\nsightings are more common during the summer and infrequent in wintertime (Gaskin &amp; \n\nWatson, 1985; Barlow, 1988; Sekiguchi, 1995). During the winter, the coastal occurrence \n\nis considerably reduced, since the species supposedly move offshore to the border of the \n\ncontinental shelf (DETR et al., 2000)  \n\n This seasonal variation could be a response to a change in oceanographic \n\nconditions (Lockyer, 1995; Br\u00e4ger et al., 2003) or changes in the availability and \n\ndistribution of prey (DETR et al., 2000). Other factors could be the depth, current velocity \n\nand sub-surface topography and gradient (Whaley, 2004). In this case, 100% of the \n\nsightings were made in areas where the slope varies between 0 \u2013 80 m.km-1, \n\ncorresponding to a ER of 0.9. Also 19 sightings were made in the [50-100[ depth (m), 2 \n\nsightings in [100-150[ depth (m) and only one sighting was made in more than 150m \n\ndepth (Fig. 20). Although most sightings were in shallow waters, an increase of the ER as \n\ndepth increased could be noticed (Fig. 20). This is possible because most of the survey \n\neffort was in shallow waters. Therefore it would be really interesting to survey in deeper \n\nareas in order to have a better understanding of how this animals use those areas. \n\n According to Taylor &amp; Dawson (1984), the Harbour porpoise is typically found \nalone or in small groups. This fact was noticed in the present study area, where in 22 \n\nsightings, 100% of them involved groups of 6 individual or less (Fig.25 &amp; 26). \n\n The studies made by Sequeira and Ferreira (1994), show that 50% of the cause of \n\nmortality of Harbour porpoises is related to fishery activities. Most of the stranding \n\n\n\n \n \n\n48 \n\ninformation is also focused more in the centre and north of the country (Sequeira et al., \n\n1992; Sequeira and Ferreira, 1994; Sequeira, 1996), and there is little information about \n\nstrandings in the South part of the mainland Portugal (Sequeira et al., 1992; Sequeira et \n\nal., 1996). The work done by the Portuguese Stranding Network in mainland Portugal, \n\ncoordinated by the Nature Conservation Institute in collaboration with the Portuguese Wild \n\nLife Society (Ferreira, personal communication), provides most of the stranding \n\ninformation, mainly for the Harbour porpoises, and it should be expanded in a more active \n\naway to the South. There is a need for basic information on the biology of P. phocoena \n\nand other small cetaceans, including their current abundance (Hammond et al., 2002). It is \n\nextremely important to better survey the South part of Portugal to get a better and more \n\ncomplete picture of the abundance and occurrence of P. phocoena in the area and also of \n\nhow the abundance of this species can be estimated in European waters. \n\n These results are very limited, and only provide a baseline on the abundance and \n\noccurrence of this species in the study area, but gives no information concerning the \n\nincrease, decrease or stable number of the population.  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n49 \n\nAtlantic Bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) \n\n In the present study, a total of 20 sightings associated to 9599.22 km of effort \n\nresulted in an ER of 0.21 and an AI of 3.56, (Table IV) revealing that this area could be an \n\nimportant zone for Bottlenose dolphins. The maps corresponding to the density and \n\ndistribution can be seen in figures 16 and 17, showing the high probability of abundance \n\nand occurrence of Bottlenose dolphin in study area. Comparing the maps of the ER and \n\nAI using the Kernel analysis it is evident that in few areas the probability of occurrence \n\ndiffer from the areas of abundance. However, in this analysis it was found that there are \n\nmore common areas where there is a higher probability of occurrence than abundance. \n\nBottlenose dolphins have an extensive distribution and are found in a wide range of \n\nhabitats, although our understanding of habitat preference is limited and most of the \n\nstudies were conducted in tropical coastal waters (Wilson et al., 1997). In the study area, \n\nBottlenose dolphins were found in average very close to shore, 5519.34 m (Fig.15). In \n\nrelation to slope, 100% of the sightings were made in areas where the slope varies \n\nbetween 0 m.km-1 and 80 m.km-1, corresponding to an ER of 1.74. \n\n Concerning the depth, 17 sightings were made in the bathymetry class of [50-100[ \n\ndepth (m), one sighting was observed in the bathymetry of [100-150[ depth (m) and one \n\nsighting in more than 150 m depth (Fig.21). When comparing the ER with the bathymetry \n\n(Fig.21), is possible to see that in shallow waters where most of the sightings occurred, \n\nthe ER is lower than in deeper waters. This can be explained because most of the survey \n\neffort was done in shallow waters. To better understand how these animals use deeper \n\nwaters, it is necessary to increase the survey effort in deeper zones. \n\n The social organization of Bottlenose dolphins it is very variable, but in general it is \n\nconsidered that larger groups are found more offshore and smaller groups more inshore. \n\nA typical group varies between 2 and 25 animals, although there are reports of groups \n\nfrom 100 to 1000 individual (Evans 1987; Perrin et al., 2002). In the present study, most of \n\nthe groups found were between 1 and 30 individuals (18 sightings); only two sightings \n\nwere made for groups larger than 30 individuals; and the mean group size was 17 animals \n\n(Fig.27). Bottlenose dolphins are a species with a social organization that is both variable \n\nand complex (Quintana-Rizzo and Wells, 2001). This species has a fission\u2013fusion social \n\norganization, exhibiting associations that change frequently in composition and size over \n\nsmall spatial and temporal scales and with others that are remarkably stable over many \n\nyears (Wells et al., 1987; Wells 1991; Connor et al., 1992; Smolker et al., 1992).  \n\n The birth period changes per area and it has been described in Florida during \n\nAutumn and in Europe around mid-summer (Reynolds et al., 2000; Perrin et al., 2002). In \n\n\n\n \n \n\n50 \n\nthe present study, most of the data was collect during summertime, and in 11 sightings \n\nout of 20, calves or newborns were present (Fig 29). \n\n The Bottlenose dolphin is an important species for conservation. The species is \n\nlisted in the Annex II of the EU Habitats Directive, which considers it a priority species for \n\nconservation, and requires the creation of SACs (Special Areas of Conservation) in \n\nEuropean waters. The conservation status of the species, according to the Red Book of \n\nthe IUCN, is \u201cData Deficient\u201d (www.redlist.org), although there is evidence of declines in \n\npopulations in Northern Europe, the Mediterranean and in the Black Sea (Evans 1987; \n\nwww.redlist.org). Historical catches, accidental captures and environmental degradation \n\nare linked to declines in these populations (IWC 1992). In the Portuguese Red List the \n\nconservation status of Bottlenose dolphins is \u201cLeast Concern\u201d. \n\n Results from this study, although very limited, clearly indicate that Bottlenose \n\ndolphins are an important and present species in the south of Portugal. More studies are \n\nnecessary to better understand how this species use the southern region of Portugal. \n\nSuch data could provide the key to improving the conservation status of this species in \n\nPortugal and in European waters, and to establish strong conservation plans and \n\nmanagement.  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n51 \n\nOther Species \n\nMinke whale \n\n In the study area there was only one sighting of a Minke whale (Fig 18), \n\ncorresponding to only one individual, associated to an ER and to an AI of 0.01 (Table IV). \n\nThe animal was 15469,50 m away from shore, in a 1000 m deep area. Although there was \n\njust one sighting of this species during the study period, fishermen from the local \n\ncommunity report relatively frequent observations of these animals. It is relatively well-\n\nunderstood the way these animals occurs at higher latitudes in the North Atlantic (Stewart \n\n&amp; Leatherwood, 1985), but in lower latitudes the species is poorly known and understood. \n\nSome are believed to be present in the Caribbean in the west and around the Strait of \n\nGibraltar in the east (Christensen et al., 1990). More studies and information are \n\nnecessary to see how Minke whales use the habitat in the south of Portugal, and where \n\nthey occur. \n\n \n \nHumpback whale \n\n During the study period, a single humpback whale was observed (Fig 18), \n\ncorresponding to an ER and an AI of 0.01 (Table IV). The animal was a juvenile and it was \n\nextremely close to shore only 1774,4 m away, corresponding to a depth of 50 m. This \n\nindividual had a \u201cpeanut-shaped\u201d head, which is associated with an emaciated and \n\nunderweight body condition (Fair et al., 2006). This suggests that this animal was not in \n\nthe most healthy condition.  \n\n \n\nRisso\u2019s Dolphin  \n\nDuring this work there were 2 sightings of Rissos\u2019s dolphin (Fig 18), corresponding to an \n\nER of 0.02 and an AI of 0.10 (table IV). One of the sightings was made at 18062,6 m from \n\nshore, at a depth of 179,32 m, and the other one, was made at 8652,9 m from shore and \n\n100 m deep. The groups range between 1 and 5 (Table IV). The group size varies \n\nbetween 1 and 5 individuals (Table IV). According to Evans (1987) inshore groups are \n\nalways smaller than offshore ones. It would be interesting to collect more information \n\nabout how these animals occurred in the area, and Photo-ID studies should be made. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n52 \n\n6.2. Photo-identification \n\n The possibility of identifying individuals in the field allows scientists to better \nestimate population parameters and model their social structure (Hammond et al., 1990; \n\nAuger-M\u00e9th\u00e9 and Whitehead 2007). \n\n In this study, a whale watching platform was used to collect the Photo-ID data. \n\nSeveral problems occurred during the process of photographing the groups. The boat \n\nused was a small RHIB with a capacity for 12 tourists and had very limited space on \n\nboard. It was difficult to move on the boat in order to take high quality photos. Most of the \n\npictures were taken from the back of the boat so as not to disturb the tourists. Also, the \n\nmain interest of the company and the skippers is to allow tourists to view the animals; they \n\nare not concern with positioning the boat to allow the perfect conditions for Photo-ID. \n\nTherefore, in several sightings, the relative position of the boat and the dolphins was poor \n\nand it was not possible to take photos at angles of 90\u00ba or 270\u00ba. In Photo-ID work the sun \n\nshould be behind the photographer so that the sunlight lights up the features of the dorsal \n\nfin and the back of the animals. When the sun is behind the subject in relation to the \n\nphotographer, the dorsal fin will appear as a silhouette, not showing markings, such as \n\ncoloration patterns, identifying scratches or lesions, on the fin or back of the animal \n\n(Culloch 2004). These are probably the reasons for the small number of photos analysed, \n\n1353, and also the higher number of photos with Q0 and Q1 in relation to Q2 (Table VII). \n\nCommon dolphins are also very difficult to photograph. They move quickly and are active \n\nwhen coming to the surface, resulting in a lot of water in front of the dorsal fin and thus \n\nreducing the possibility of identifying the individual.  \n\n It has been suggested that the tissue of the dorsal fin does not regenerate (W\u00fcrsig \n\nand W\u00fcrsig 1977; Bigg 1982; Auger-M\u00e9th\u00e9 and Whitehead 2007), however notches can \n\nelongate on growing fins or can become shallower with time (Auger-M\u00e9th\u00e9 and Whitehead \n\n2007). Also, natural marks can change with time and the individuals who are recognized \n\nby those marks can become unidentifiable (Hammond 1986; Auger-M\u00e9th\u00e9 and Whitehead \n\n2007). \n\n In the case of Photo-ID analysis for common dolphins, the identification is based \n\non a combination of natural marks and dorsal fin pigmentation patterns (Neumann et al., \n\n2002; Bearzi et al., 2005). Therefore, in this study, only individuals having obvious long-\n\nterm marks on their dorsal fins were included in the catalogue, resulting in 342 individuals \n\nidentified. \n\n Another important fact to consider in this study was the limitation in time spent with \n\nthe group of animals which reduced the chance to properly photograph most of the \n\nindividuals of the group. Also, when encountering large groups, the boat would only stay \n\n\n\n \n \n\n53 \n\nwith the animals that come close to the boat, again reducing the possibility of covering \n\nmost of the individuals in the full group. This can result in a considerable bias in the \n\nestimation of the population size favouring the underestimation, a reason why this topic \n\nwas not included in the present work. \n\n Also the fact that only highly marked animals were catalogued may lead to \n\nunderestimation, since the marks can be unevenly distributed within a population, allowing \n\nthe identification of only some of its individuals (Gowans and Whitehead 2001; Auger-\n\nM\u00e9th\u00e9 and Whitehead 2007). \n\n When comparing the created catalogue with the already existent catalogue from \n\nthe Gulf of Cadiz, no matches were found. This result does not mean that there is no \n\nmixing between the individuals in the two areas. It is necessary to increase the effort in \n\nthe Photo-ID process and keep both catalogues active and in constant comparison. \n\n The distribution, habitat use and the understanding of the dynamics of a dolphin \n\npopulation can be obtained when individuals are followed for a number of years during \n\nlong-term mark-recapture studies utilising photo-identification (Wilson et al., 1999; Rogan \n\net al., 2000; Culloch 2004). It would be extremely interesting to continue working on the \n\nPhoto-ID of Common dolphins in order to estimate the population size using mark \n\ncapture-recapture models. With a long-term study, it would be possible to define if the \n\nsame individuals are present year after year, and create a discovery curve for Common \n\ndolphins, allowing the estimation of an increase or decrease in the population size as well \n\nas immigration and emigration rates. For that, more photos are necessary from different \n\nyears and also from different times of the year. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n54 \n\n7. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS \n\n This work provides the first information on the summer distribution of cetaceans in \n\nnear shore areas between Cape S\u00e3o Vicente and Lagos. The contribution of this study is \n\nhighly relevant since cetacean surveys, had never been conducted before in most of the \n\nresearch area. The study area, during the summer, is characterized by the constant \n\npresence of the Common dolphin, Delphinus delphis, the Atlantic Bottlenose dolphin, \n\nTursiops truncates, and the Harbour porpoise, Phocoena phocoena. \n\n The Common dolphin is definitely the species that most occurs in the area and \n\nalso the most abundant, with higher values of both ER and AI.  \n\nThe geographic area covered was limited to near shore waters of the Algarve, over the \n\ncontinental shelf, and during the summer time. Thus, it is necessary to carry on with it, in \n\nmore distant areas and during other seasons, in order to properly understand how the \n\nstudied species use the region. Also, given the high mobility and broad distribution of \n\ncetaceans, it is necessary to collect information from the whole Gulf of Cadiz to obtain a \n\nmore complete overview of the population(s) that occurs in the area. \n\n In accordance with the constraints that characterize the present study, the \n\nCommon dolphin Photo-ID study is also rather limited, providing only a rough idea of the \n\nnumber of individuals that were possible to identify in the area. In order to make the \n\nPhoto-ID album a more efficient tool, it is necessary carry on with the photo recording \n\nprocess and expand it to the other species present. The use of whale watching platforms \n\nto collect Photo-ID data should be continued and encouraged. \n\n Concerning the spatial distribution of cetaceans in the area, habitat preference \n\nmodels, such as GLM and GAM models, using the physiographical features of the area \n\nand considering the cetacean occurrence and abundance should be applied. \n\nThe lack of knowledge in the habitat use of cetaceans in the South of Portugal represents \n\nand drawback for effective cetacean\u2019s conservation.  \n\n This study reveals the presence of two protected species, the Bottlenose dolphin \n\nand the Harbour porpoise. The Habitats Directive only allows the creation of marine \n\nprotected areas (MPAs) for these 2 species, therefore, it is important to consider the \n\ncreation of MPAs that cover identified hotspots for cetaceans, supported by the \n\ndevelopment and implementation of an effective management strategy. \n\n Concerning the Bottlenose dolphins and the Harbour porpoises, the data analysed \n\nrepresents a short-term survey, in 2009, so it is necessary to consider that it may have led \n\nto biased conclusions about the habitat use of these species in this area.  \n\n In spite of that fact, the results obtained strongly suggest that the South coast of \n\nPortugal is an important area for several species of cetaceans.  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n55 \n\n8.
