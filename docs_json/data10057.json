However, HSB has \n\nreceived little attention compared to other topics of headland-bay beach research, such as the \n\nbeach planform rotation and stability. Thus, the main goal of this thesis was to increase the \n\nknowledge on HSB and recognize its role on the sediment budget of headland-bay beaches. \n\nThe study was carried out in a 100 km rocky coastal stretch located at the Portuguese western \n\ncoast, between the Carvoeiro and Raso capes, where numerous headland-bay beaches develops \n\nin a wide range of different geomorphological settings. \n\nTo achieve the proposed goals, the work was supported by several complementary approaches \n\nthat gave insights on the processes that constrain headland-bay beaches evolution at a wide \n\nrange of spatial and temporal scales. These approaches included: (1) detailed morphological and \n\nsedimentological analysis of the beaches and inner continental shelf; (2) the study of the \n\nlongshore drift based on a fluorescent tracer experiment (short-term approach) and empirical \n\nmodelling (long-term approach); (3) the development and application of a new shoreline \n\nevolution model (SEM-PLAT) that simulate shoreline changes on beaches develop over a rocky \n\nshore platform; and (4) the analysis of the sediment sources and sinks along the studied coastal \n\nstretch and study of long-term evolution trends. \n\nThe results obtained allowed to classify dominant HSB processes in two main modes, which are \n\nin line with two of the existing conceptual models. The processes were classified according to \n\nthe prevailing domain where sediment bypass the headlands as: (1) beach headland sediment \n\nbypassing (BSB) \u2013 a process that takes place at the subaerial section of the beach, and (2) inner \n\nshelf headland sediment bypassing (SSB) \u2013 a process that occurs on the submarine domain. BSB \n\nprocess is triggered by the persistence of incoming wave direction, inducing beach rotation that, \n\nespecially in low-degree embayments, can result in a continuous inner sandbar along the \n\nheadland coast, which migrates downdrift and welds to the downdrift beach. This process is \n\ndominated by the longshore drift, occurring mainly in the intertidal zone and, eventually, in very \n\n\n\nAbstract \n\n \n\n \n\nvi \n\nshallow depths of the submarine domain. SSB process, on the other hand, is triggered by high-\n\nenergy wave conditions. Under these conditions, the strong offshore currents can transport \n\nsediment outside the embayments. The sediment that is pushed offshore is distributed on the \n\ninner shelf and eventually transported alongshore, bypassing the headlands. When wave energy \n\nstart to reduce, the sediment is slowly transported onshore and start to weld to the downdrift \n\nbeaches. This process depends on both cross- and longshore transport components and can \n\noccur in both low- and high-indented beaches. \n\nThe results also showed that HSB is a selective process. Coarser particles such gravel and very \n\ncoarse sand tend to be trapped inside the embayments, being their bypass very low or negligible. \n\nCoarse sand bypass occurs mainly in the subaerial beach, except during major storm events, \n\nwhen the wave energy triggers an extreme efficient selective process, transporting the lighter \n\nsediment particles offshore (including coarser sands), originating heavy mineral placer deposits. \n\nThis selective process can generate large placer deposits (e.g. Grande beach) due to a long-term \n\nenrichment in heavy mineral particles. In the case of medium sand particles, headland bypass \n\ncan occur either subaerial beach or inner shelf domain, depend on the wave energy; while fine \n\nsand bypass occur mainly at the inner shelf. \n\nThis work also allowed to have a better understanding of the coastal dynamics of the target \n\ncoastal stretch.  The sediment transport patterns suggest that the studied coast is segmented in \n\nfour sediment sub-cells: (1) Carvoeiro-Consola\u00e7\u00e3o; (2) Consola\u00e7\u00e3o-Lamporeira; (3) Lamporeira-\n\nRoca; and (4) Roca-Raso. The first sub-cell have particular characteristics due to the shelter \n\npromoted by the Peniche peninsula to the NW dominant waves and corresponds to a small \n\nclosed system. The sub-cells (2) to (4) are macro scale embayments that are connected and have \n\na similar sedimentary dynamics. The northern sectors of these embayments have a NW-SE or \n\nN- S general orientation and net longshore drift is southward for both winter and summer wave \n\nconditions. Thus, within these sectors, HSB occurs always southward, independently of the HSB \n\nprocess. The southern sectors, on the other hand, have a NE-SW general orientation and net \n\nlongshore drift is southward, in the summer, and northward, in the winter. In these sectors, HSB \n\noccur mainly through the BSB, during summer, induced by the higher persistence of NW waves. \n\nWhile in winter, occur preferable through the SSB due to the increase of wave energy and \n\nconsidering that, BSB northward is unlikely due to the larger distances between the shoreline \n\n(beach berm) and the tip of the headlands and the lower persistence of W and SW waves. The \n\nbalance between the longshore transport components within the southern sectors of the macro \n\nscale embayments, results in a sediment recirculation, which explains the sandier nature of inner \n\nshelf in these sectors compared to the northern ones. This also suggest that sediment can have \n\n\n\nAbstract \n\n \n\nvii \n\na relatively long residence time inside these sub-cells. However, once sediment cross the sub-\n\ncell boundaries cannot return, because at the downdrift side the net longshore drift is \n\npermanently southward (gated boundaries). The frequency of the sediment linkage between \n\nthese sub-cells depends on the seasonal and interannual wave climate variability; while the \n\nmagnitude depends on the balance between the sediment sources and sinks of each sub-cell \n\nand was estimated in the order of 104 m3.yr-1. \n\nThe sediment budget and beach long-term evolution study, indicate that the studied littoral is \n\nin equilibrium with present-day conditions. However, SEM-PLAT model results showed that \n\nseasonal (and interannual) changes in the incident wave climate can significantly affect the \n\nbeach configuration or even its development, putting in evidence the delicate dynamic \n\nequilibrium of these beaches. This delicate equilibrium and the linkage of the beaches through \n\nthe HSB processes, suggests that climate changes can have strong impacts on their evolution. \n\nKeywords: Headland sediment bypassing; Headland-bay beaches; Longshore sediment \n\ntransport; Coastal dynamics; Portuguese western coast. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAbstract \n\n \n\n \n\nviii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nix \n\nResumo \n\nO conhecimento dos processos de transposi\u00e7\u00e3o sedimentar de promont\u00f3rios (TSP) \u00e9 \n\nfundamental para definir o balan\u00e7o sedimentar das c\u00e9lulas litorais, sendo particularmente \n\nrelevante nos sistemas de praia em enseadas, t\u00edpicos de costas rochosas. No entanto, o estudo \n\ndas praias em enseada t\u00eam sido essencialmente focado na investiga\u00e7\u00e3o da rota\u00e7\u00e3o e da \n\nconfigura\u00e7\u00e3o de equil\u00edbrio da sua forma planar, uma vez que, estas praias s\u00e3o habitualmente \n\nconsideradas como sistemas relativamente fechados. Comparativamente, pouco se tem \n\ninvestido na compreens\u00e3o dos processos de TSP. Assim, o principal objetivo desta tese foi \n\ncontribuir para o conhecimento dos processos de TSP e perceber a sua influ\u00eancia no balan\u00e7o \n\nsedimentar das praias em enseada. \n\nO estudo foi desenvolvido num tro\u00e7o litoral com cerca de 100 km de extens\u00e3o, localizado na \n\ncosta ocidental portuguesa, entre o cabo Carvoeiro e o cabo Raso. Este tro\u00e7o \u00e9 particularmente \n\nrochoso, inclui promont\u00f3rios de v\u00e1rias dimens\u00f5es e acomoda um conjunto de praias com \n\ndiferente comprimento, orienta\u00e7\u00e3o, grau de encaixe e exposi\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 agita\u00e7\u00e3o mar\u00edtima dominante \n\nde noroeste.  \n\nPara alcan\u00e7ar os objetivos propostos, o trabalho foi suportado por v\u00e1rias abordagens \n\ncomplementares que permitiram estudar os processos que condicionam a evolu\u00e7\u00e3o das praias \n\nem enseada, a diferentes escalas espaciais e temporais. As aproxima\u00e7\u00f5es utilizadas foram: (1) a \n\nan\u00e1lise morfol\u00f3gica e sedimentol\u00f3gica das praias e da plataforma continental interna; (2) o \n\nestudo da deriva litoral atrav\u00e9s de uma aproxima\u00e7\u00e3o de curto prazo, baseada numa experi\u00eancia \n\nde tra\u00e7adores fluorescentes, e uma aproxima\u00e7\u00e3o de longo prazo, baseada em taxas de \n\ntransporte sedimentar potencial estimadas a partir de formula\u00e7\u00f5es emp\u00edricas; (3) o \n\ndesenvolvimento e aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de um modelo de evolu\u00e7\u00e3o de linha de costa \u2013 o modelo \n\nSEM- PLAT, que simula a evolu\u00e7\u00e3o da linha de costa em praias que se desenvolvem sobre \n\nplataformas rochosas; e por \u00faltimo, (4) a an\u00e1lise das fontes e sumidouros sedimentares ao longo \n\nda costa em estudo e, das tend\u00eancias de evolu\u00e7\u00e3o a longo prazo das praias. \n\n\n\nResumo \n\n \n\nx \n\nOs resultados obtidos sugerem a exist\u00eancia de dois processos de TSP dominantes que est\u00e3o em \n\nlinha com dois dos modelos conceptuais existentes. Estes processos foram classificados de \n\nacordo com o dom\u00ednio onde a transposi\u00e7\u00e3o ocorre em: (1) transposi\u00e7\u00e3o sedimentar de \n\npromont\u00f3rios na praia - um processo que ocorre essencialmente na praia suba\u00e9rea, e \n\ntransposi\u00e7\u00e3o sedimentar de promont\u00f3rios na plataforma continental interna - um processo que \n\nocorre no dom\u00ednio submarino. O processo de transposi\u00e7\u00e3o na praia \u00e9 desencadeado pela \n\npersist\u00eancia da dire\u00e7\u00e3o de onda incidente, induzindo a rota\u00e7\u00e3o das praias que, em enseadas com \n\nbaixa indenta\u00e7\u00e3o, pode resultar numa barra arenosa interna, cont\u00ednua, que atravessa a costa do \n\npromont\u00f3rio, migrando e soldando-se com a praia a sotamar. Este processo \u00e9 dominado pela \n\nderiva litoral, ocorrendo principalmente na zona intertidal e, eventualmente, nas zonas menos \n\nprofundas da praia submarina. A transposi\u00e7\u00e3o na plataforma interna, por outro lado, \u00e9 \n\ndesencadeada por condi\u00e7\u00f5es de agita\u00e7\u00e3o mar\u00edtima de elevada energia. Nessas condi\u00e7\u00f5es, as \n\nintensas correntes em dire\u00e7\u00e3o ao largo, podem transportar sedimentos para fora das enseadas. \n\nEsse sedimento \u00e9 distribu\u00eddo na plataforma interna e, eventualmente, transportado \n\nlongilitoralmente, transpondo os promont\u00f3rios. Quando a energia das ondas come\u00e7a a diminuir, \n\no sedimento \u00e9 transportado lentamente em dire\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 costa, alimentado as praias a sotamar. \n\nEste processo depende de ambas as componentes de transporte (transversal e longilitoral) e \n\npode ocorrer em praias com baixo ou elevado grau de encaixe. \n\nOs resultados tamb\u00e9m mostraram que a transposi\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 um processo seletivo. As part\u00edculas mais \n\ngrosseiras, como o cascalho e a areia muito grosseira, tendem a ficar retidas nas enseadas, sendo \n\na transposi\u00e7\u00e3o destas part\u00edculas neglig\u00edvel ou de baixa magnitude. No caso das areias grosseiras, \n\na transposi\u00e7\u00e3o ocorre essencialmente na praia suba\u00e9rea, exceto durante tempestades extremas, \n\nquando a energia das ondas desencadeia um processo extremamente seletivo, que transporta \n\na part\u00edculas mais leve para o largo (incluindo as areias mais grosseiras), originando dep\u00f3sitos de \n\nplacer. Em algumas praias (e.g. praia Grande) estes dep\u00f3sitos de placer podem apresentar uma \n\ndimens\u00e3o consider\u00e1vel devido a um processo cumulativo de longo prazo de part\u00edculas de \n\nminerais pesados. A transposi\u00e7\u00e3o de areias m\u00e9dias pode ocorrer em ambos os dom\u00ednios, isto \u00e9, \n\nna praia suba\u00e9rea e na plataforma interna, dependo da energia das ondas; enquanto a \n\ntransposi\u00e7\u00e3o de areias finas ocorre essencialmente em dom\u00ednio de plataforma interna. \n\nOs resultados obtidos no \u00e2mbito deste trabalho permitiram tamb\u00e9m uma melhor compreens\u00e3o \n\nda din\u00e2mica sedimentar do tro\u00e7o costeiro em estudo. Os padr\u00f5es de deriva litoral ao longo da \n\ncosta sugerem que esta se encontra segmentada em quatro sub-c\u00e9lulas sedimentares: (1) \n\nCarvoeiro-Consola\u00e7\u00e3o; (2) Consola\u00e7\u00e3o-Lamporeira; (3) Lamporeira-Roca; E (4) Roca-Raso. A \n\nprimeira sub-c\u00e9lula corresponde a uma pequena enseada com caracter\u00edsticas particulares \n\n\n\nResumo \n\n \n\nxi \n\ndevido ao abrigo gerado pela pen\u00ednsula de Peniche \u00e0s ondas dominantes de noroeste e, \n\ncorresponde a um pequeno sistema fechado. As sub-c\u00e9lulas (2) a (4) constituem tr\u00eas enseadas \n\nde macro escala que se encontram conectadas e apresentam uma din\u00e2mica sedimentar \n\nsemelhante. Os setores norte destas sub-c\u00e9lulas t\u00eam uma orienta\u00e7\u00e3o geral NO-SE ou N-S e uma \n\nderiva litoral residual dirigida para sul, quer para as condi\u00e7\u00f5es de agita\u00e7\u00e3o mar\u00edtima de ver\u00e3o, \n\nquer de inverno. Assim, nestes setores, a transposi\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 unidirecional (para sul), \n\nindependentemente do processo de transposi\u00e7\u00e3o. Nos setores sul, a orienta\u00e7\u00e3o geral da costa \n\n\u00e9 NE-SO e a deriva litoral residual \u00e9 dirigida para sul, no ver\u00e3o, e para norte, no inverno. No \n\nver\u00e3o a transposi\u00e7\u00e3o ocorre atrav\u00e9s do processo de transposi\u00e7\u00e3o na praia suba\u00e9rea, devido \u00e0 \n\nmaior persist\u00eancia de ondas vindas de noroeste; enquanto no inverno, dever\u00e1 ocorrer \n\nessencialmente atrav\u00e9s do processo de transposi\u00e7\u00e3o na plataforma interna, devido ao aumento \n\nde energia do clima de agita\u00e7\u00e3o mar\u00edtima. No inverno, o processo de transposi\u00e7\u00e3o na praia \n\ndirigido para norte, \u00e9 pouco prov\u00e1vel tendo em conta as maiores dist\u00e2ncias entre a linha de \n\ncosta (neste caso, a crista da berma) e a ponta dos promont\u00f3rios e, tamb\u00e9m, porque as \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es de agita\u00e7\u00e3o mar\u00edtima de oeste e sudoeste s\u00e3o menos persistentes. O equil\u00edbrio entre \n\nas componentes norte e sul do transporte longilitoral, nos sectores sul destas sub-c\u00e9lulas, \n\norigina uma recircula\u00e7\u00e3o de sedimentos que explica a natureza arenosa da plataforma interna \n\nnesses setores, em oposi\u00e7\u00e3o aos sectores norte mais rochosos. Este facto sugere que o \n\nsedimento pode ter um tempo de perman\u00eancia relativamente longo dentro das sub-c\u00e9lulas. No \n\nentanto, quando o sedimento transp\u00f5em as fronteiras das sub-c\u00e9lulas, n\u00e3o pode reverter o seu \n\nmovimento porque no lado sotamar a deriva litoral residual \u00e9 permanentemente dirigida para \n\nsul. A frequ\u00eancia da liga\u00e7\u00e3o sedimentar entre as sub-c\u00e9lulas, depende da variabilidade sazonal \n\ne interanual do clima de agita\u00e7\u00e3o mar\u00edtima. A magnitude, por outro lado, depende do balan\u00e7o \n\nentre as fontes e sumidouros sedimentares de cada sub-c\u00e9lula e foi estimada na ordem de \n\n104  m3.ano-1. \n\nO balan\u00e7o sedimentar e o estudo da evolu\u00e7\u00e3o de longo prazo das praias, indicam que o litoral \n\nestudado est\u00e1 em equil\u00edbrio com as condi\u00e7\u00f5es atuais. No entanto, os resultados do modelo \n\nSEM- PLAT mostraram que varia\u00e7\u00f5es sazonais (e interanuais) no clima de agita\u00e7\u00e3o mar\u00edtima \n\npodem afetar significativamente a sua configura\u00e7\u00e3o, colocando em evid\u00eancia o equil\u00edbrio \n\ndin\u00e2mico delicado destas praias. Este equil\u00edbrio delicado e a liga\u00e7\u00e3o das praias atrav\u00e9s do \n\nprocessos de transposi\u00e7\u00e3o sedimentar, sugerem que altera\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas podem ter impactos \n\nsignificativos na sua evolu\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nPalavras-chave: Transposi\u00e7\u00e3o sedimentar de promont\u00f3rios; Praias de enseada; Transporte \n\nlongilitoral de sedimentos; Din\u00e2mica

bypassing (HSB) plays an important role in the definition of coastal sediment \n\nbudget, having particular relevance in headland-bay coasts. However, headland-bay beaches \n\nresearch is usually focused on beach planform rotation and stability  (e.g. Yasso, 1965; Silvester \n\nand Ho, 1972; Hsu et al., 1989; Moreno and Kraus 1999; Klein et al., 2002; Bowman et al., 2009; \n\nIglesias et al., 2009;  Silveira et al., 2010; Thomas et al., 2010; Oliveira and Barreiro, 2010; \n\nHarley  et al., 2011; Short et al., 2014; Daly et al., 2015), since these beaches are generally \n\nregarded as fairly closed systems. On the other hand, sediment bypassing have been extensively \n\nstudied in the context of tidal inlets and harbours, due to navigation safety issues and to solve \n\ndowndrift erosion problems induced by the channels dredging and jetties implementation. \n\nExamples of these studies are Fitzgerald (1982), Sexton and Hayes (1982), Bruun and \n\nWillekes  (1992), Fitzgerald et al. (2000), Kraus (2000), Walton (2005), Mariani et al., 2010, \n\nAcworth and Lawson (2011), but many others can be found in the compilation report provided \n\nby Boswood and Murray (2001). Furthermore, despite the several references to the natural HSB \n\nfound in literature, as will be seen below, few are those that focus on a detail description and \n\nconceptualization of the these processes. For these reasons and taking into account that 51 % \n\nof the world\u2019s coast consists of mountainous or hilly coastline (Inman and Nordstrom, 1971), \n\nwhere embayed beaches tend to occur, the study of HSB processes continues to be a challenge. \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n2 \n\n RESEARCH OBJECTIVES \n\nThis thesis aimed to improve the current understanding of HSB through the identification and \n\nthe description of controlling processes. To achieve this goal a rocky coastal stretch that hosts \n\nseveral headland-bay beaches, located at the Portuguese western coast, was chosen as case \n\nstudy. Depth, direction, frequency, magnitude and sediment characteristics of the HSB were \n\ninvestigated, as well as their relationship. Moreover, this work also intended to define the \n\nsediment budget and to understand the implications of the HSB in the sedimentary dynamics of \n\nthe studied coastal stretch. The results obtained were synthetized through conceptual models \n\nof both HSB processes and sedimentary dynamics of the study site. \n\n THESIS OUTLINE \n\nIn order to achieve the proposed objectives this study covered a wide range of topics, including \n\nmorphological, sedimentological and oceanographic data analyses, a tracer experiment and \n\nprocesses modelling, and was structured in eight chapters: \n\nChapter 1 provides a general introduction that includes the thesis motivation, objectives and \n\noutline, as well as an overview about HSB processes and the general settings of the study site. \n\nChapter 2 presents a geomorphological and sedimentological characterization of the inner \n\ncontinental shelf based on bathymetric LiDAR and side-scan sonar surveys, satellite images, \n\northophotomaps, sediment samples and on the sedimentological map of Portuguese \n\ncontinental shelf.  \n\nChapter 3 characterizes the beach morphology and its relation with the incident wave \n\nconditions. Beach morphodynamics is characterized through a beach planform analysis, based \n\non orthophotomaps and satellite images, and a cross-shore morphological analysis, based on \n\ntopographic data. \n\nChapter 4 includes the sedimentological characterization of the studied beaches based on \n\nsediment grain-size and compositional analyses.  \n\nChapter 5 analysis longshore sediment transport patterns using a short-term approach, based \n\non a fluorescent tracer experiment, and a long-term approach, based on the potential longshore \n\ntransport estimated with empirical formulas and a wave time-series. \n\nChapter 6 includes the description and application of a new shoreline evolution model \u2013 \n\nSEM- PLAT, developed to simulate shoreline changes on coastal stretches where beaches \n\ndevelop over a rocky shore platform. \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n \n\n3 \n\nChapter 7 defines the sediment budget of the study site, based on the: (i) literature review about \n\nsediment sources and sinks; (ii) new estimates of sediment supply and sediment retention \n\nrelated with the sea-level rise; (iii) beach evolution trends observed through recent and \n\nhistorical ground-photographs; and (iv) information obtained from the previous chapters. \n\nChapter 8 presents a synthesis of the results obtained in the scope of this thesis and put forward \n\nconceptual models for HSB processes and their implications in the sedimentary dynamics of the \n\nstudy site; it also presents the general conclusions and give guidelines for further research. \n\n OVERVIEW OF HEADLAND SEDIMENT BYPASSING \n\nHeadlands can be described as a piece of land with steep cliff face, jutting out from the coast \n\ninto a large body of water (Neuendorf et al., 2005). These landforms can act as obstacles to the \n\nlongshore sediment transport dividing the coast into littoral cells, which are compartments \n\nwhere sediment transport is relatively self-contain. However, depending on the headland size \n\nand morphology (George et al., 2015), on sediment availability and on sediment transport \n\nmechanisms, HSB can occurred at different depths, with variable magnitude and frequency. \n\nHSB is a process in which sediment is transported by wind or waves from the upstream side of \n\na headland to the downstream side. Notwithstanding the importance of headland bypass dune \n\nfields in the sediment budget of some coasts (e.g. McLachlan et al., 1994; Boeyinga et al., 2010), \n\nthe present study focuses on the HSB induce by waves. \n\nThe HSB induced by waves has been study by some authors, such as  Short and Masselink (1999) \n\nthat presented a conceptual model based on their observations on several relatively long \n\nbeaches (> 5 km), separated by headlands at the Australian eastern coast. The model assumes \n\nthat longshore sand transport, perhaps assisted by beach rotation, causes a sand accumulation \n\non the updrift side of the headland (Figure 1.1A). Then an apparent sub-aqueous movement of \n\nthis sand around the headland occur; the sand manifests itself as a sub-aqueous sand wave on \n\nthe tip and immediately downdrift of the headland (Figure 1.1B). The sand wave may then \n\nmoves along the downdrift side of the headland as an offshore bar, a shallow attached bar or as \n\nan elongate spit which may impound a backing swash lagoon (Figure 1.1C). When the sand \n\nbar/spit is attached to the beach it usually initiates a topographically controlled rip that migrates \n\nin its advance, often causing severe localized beach erosion (Figure 1.1D). Finally, the sand wave \n\nmerges with the downdrift beach causing a slight accretion (Figure 1.1E).  \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1. Schematic illustration of headland-attached sand bar/spit bypassing. (A) Updrift accumulation; (B) \nheadland sub-aqueous sand wave; (C) downdrift attached sand bar/spit; (D) advancing of sand wave and \nerosion rip; (E) merges with downdrift beach (extracted from Short and Masselink, 1999). \n\nSmith (2001) also presented a HSB conceptual model based on his observations at Australian \n\neastern coast. According to this model, HSB manifests itself as an almost straight strand of sand \n\nthat is initiated at the headland and ends upon the downdrift beach at, or very close to, the null \n\npoint of the wave refraction orthogonal (Figure 1.2). The bypass strand converts the zone \n\nshoreward of the strand into a closed rotating cell opposite to the strand until the transport \n\nreaches the headland tip again. This closed transport cell contributes to the strand flow again \n\nand a rotary quasi-stability is attained. If this cell is sufficiently shallow, a lagoon can be observed \n\nin the centre cell during the very low tides. The author also notes that pure headland bypassing \n\nstrands will only occur when the shoaling seabed is sediment rich. When the downdrift beach is \n\nhighly curved in plan, such as many pocket beaches, without a straight beach section, it may be \n\nimpossible the bypass strand occurrence. A similar model was earlier presented by Evans (1944), \n\nreferring  that depending on the available sediment and strength of waves and currents, the \n\nsediment bypass deposit (strand) can be brought above the water and extended to downdrift \n\nside of the headland as a broad or narrow spit.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2. Schematic illustration of headland strand bypassing (adapted from Smith, 2001). \n\nStorlazzi and Field (2000) studied the sediment paths on a rocky embayed stretch at the U.S.A. \n\nwestern coast, where small pocket beaches typically occur on stream mouths (Figure 1.3A). This \n\nstudy showed that at active-margin coasts, headlands can extend offshore as barriers to the \n\nlongshore drift, and under these conditions, HSB can only occur during high-energy events. \n\nAccording to these authors, during storms, subaerial beach sediment can be eroded and carried \n\noffshore by either, seaward near-bed flows driven by wave- and wind-induced setup or intense \n\nrip currents, dispersing part of the sediment across shoreface and transporting the other part \n\nfurther offshore to the mid shelf (Figure 1.3B). After storm, smaller short-period waves obliquely \n\napproaching the coast can initiate alongshore currents, which can sweep the sediment \n\ndeposited in the subaqueous bedrock ridges front of headlands, feeding the downdrift beaches \n\nand their adjacent subaqueous depressions (paleo-stream channels). The reconstruction of the \n\npre-storm shoreface profile would then be aided by long period, low-energy swells carrying \n\nsediment onshore from greater depths (Figure 1.3C). A similar HSB process had been already \n\nhypothesized by Scholar and Griggs (1997). \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\nFigure 1.3. Schematic illustration headland sediment bypassing model hypothesized by Storlazzi and Field \n(2000) for a headland-bay coast where the beaches typically occur on stream mouths: (A) pre-storm situation; \n(B) during storm; and (C) after storm. \n\nBarriolo et al. (2012) and Ferrari et al. (2014) also reported a significant transport of gravelly \n\nsediment around the Punta del Maiolo headland (NW Mediterranean Sea, Italy), induced by a \n\nrip current. In fact, severe erosion on headland-bay beaches has been associated with the \n\noccurrence of large-scale topographically controlled rip currents during storm events. The \n\nvelocities of rip currents under these conditions are higher and can carry large quantities of \n\nsediment to great distances from the shore and to great depths (e.g. Short, 1985; Short and \n\nMasselink, 1999; Smith et al., 2010; Loureiro et al., 2012). This sediment may be lost from the \n\nbeach system to offshore, being deposited beyond the closure depth (Smith et al., 2010) or \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n \n\n7 \n\ntransported alongshore to the downdrift side of the headland as explained by Storlazzi and Field \n\n(2000). \n\nEvidences of HSB have been reported in other works, Lord and Van Kerkvoort (1981), for \n\nexample, observed a significant sediment bypassing at Diggers Headland (Australia) through a \n\ntracer experiment, carried out under moderate wave conditions (3-4 m). \n\nHume et al. (2000) analysed sand paths around a preeminent headland (Cape Rodney, New \n\nZealand) that protrudes 3-4 km into deep water, based on observational data and numerical \n\nmodelling. The study suggest that HSB in deep water is dependent of both tide and wave \n\ngenerated currents, and that this occurs episodically during storm events. The sediment bypass \n\nis small and intermittent occurring as thin, discontinuous and patchy sand bodies.  \n\nPatterson (2011) and Acworth and Lawson (2011) studied Fingal Head (Australia) sand bypass, \n\nbased on topo-bathymetric surveys. The authors describe HSB as episodic \u201cslugs\u201d of sand \n\n(relatively large) moving around the headland, generally associated with periods of high-energy \n\nwaves, aided by accelerated longshore currents. \n\nGoodwin et al. (2013) investigated the sand bypass of a preeminent headland (Cape Bayron, \n\nAustralia) based on the historical shoreface bathymetric changes and multi-decadal wave \n\nclimate variability. Two bypassing mechanisms were interpreted: (1) a predominantly cross-\n\nembayment transport connecting a headland-attached sand wave and the outer bar of \n\ndowndrift beach \u2013 like strand bypass of Smith (2001), during unimodal wave direction climate; \n\nand (2) a split transport between the nearshore path along the inner bar and cross-embayment \n\npath, during a bimodal wave direction climate. The authors conclude that the switching between \n\nHSB mechanisms on interannual to decadal timescales determines the geometry of the bypass \n\nstrand with the downdrift littoral zone. \n\nCascalho et al. (2014), Duarte et al. (2014), Lira and Taborda (2014) found evidences of sediment \n\nbypass at Nazar\u00e9 headland (Portuguese western coast), based on sediment textural analysis, a \n\nfluorescent tracer experiment and satellite images analysis, respectively. According to these \n\nworks, an ephemeral beach appears at the downdrift side of the headland as an attached-sand \n\nwave, when the updrift beach reaches its full capacity and the wave regime is low enough to \n\npreserve sand accumulation on that location. \n\nAb Razak (2015) used numerical modelling to explore the mechanisms and processes of HSB. \n\nThe author concluded that increasing the wave angle, wave height and sediment grain-size leads \n\nto the increment of sand bypassing volume; nevertheless, in all cases the process remain \n\nunchanged. The increasing of the wave height had limited the development of surf zone currents \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n8 \n\nin the middle of embayment by creating a large seaward flowing rip current, which enhances \n\nthe sand transport outside the surf zone. The author also noticed that the presence of the \n\nheadland rips currents in the model is favoured by the large wave directional spreading.  \n\nSilva et al. (2016) studied HSB at Santa Catarina Island (Brazil), using both in situ measurements \n\nand numerical modelling. This study demonstrated that in higher energy beaches, sand \n\nbypassing is entirely subaqueous, while in lower energy beaches the sand bypassing manifest by \n\nperiodic subaerial spit development and migration. The authors reinforce the idea that HSB, \n\nincluding links to inner shelf transport, should be considered in any study of headland-bay \n\nbeaches. \n\n REGIONAL SETTINGS OF THE STUDY SITE \n\nThe study site is located at Portuguese west coast and encompasses the coastal stretch from \n\nCarvoeiro cape to Raso cape (Figure 1.4). \n\n \n\nFigure 1.4.

The continental shelf in this sector constitutes a \n\nhuge submarine promontory, known as Espor\u00e3o da Estremadura (Vanney and Mougenot, 1981). \n\nThe most preeminent headlands are Carvoeiro cape, Ponta da Lamporeira, Roca cape and Raso \n\ncape, as can be noticed by the shape of the coastline and bathymetric contours presented in \n\nFigure 1.4. \n\nThe geomorphological classification presented by Marques et al. (2013), shows that about 40 % \n\nof this coast are beaches, most of which are hinged with cliffs (30 %) and a lesser extent backed \n\nby dunes (6 %) and artificial structures (4 %). The other 60 % of the coast are cliffs that plunge \n\ndirectly into the sea (11 %) or are hinged on a rocky shore platform (40 %) and, artificial \n\nstructures in contact with the sea or a rocky shore platform (9 %) (Figure 1.5).  \n\nThe studied beaches are predominantly sandy and exhibit different geometries, some present a \n\nhigh degree of embayment, while others correspond to a narrow and elongated thin sand strip \n\nthat covers a rocky shore platform. Several beaches developed in the dependence of small fluvial \n\nstreams, some of them with an intermittent outflow regime (Figure 1.5). These beaches result \n\nfrom the sedimentary infill that occurred on the Portuguese coast after mid Holocene (ca. 5000 \n\nBP), in association with the stabilization of the sea-level, and was later increased by the \n\nanthropic activities such deforestation and agriculture (Dias et al., 2000; Freitas et al., 2002). \n\nCurrently, the littoral sediment supply from fluvial streams have a modest magnitude in the \n\norder of 104 m3.yr-1 (Lira et al., 2013). \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n10 \n\n  \n\nFigure 1.5.

According to the \n\nexplanatory notes of the Geologic Map of Portugal at 1:50 000 scale (Zbyszewski et al., 1955; \n\nFran\u00e7a et al., 1960; Fran\u00e7a et al., 1961; Zbyszewski and Assun\u00e7\u00e3o, 1965; Zbyszewski et al., 1966; \n\nRamalho et al., 1993; Ramalho et al., 2001): \n\n? Meso-cenozoic sequence includes Jurassic and Cretaceous formations composed of \n\nalternating limestones, marls, sandstones, conglomerates and mudstones; Eocene-\n\nOligocene conglomerates, sands and clays with some intercalations of marls and \n\nlimestones; Miocene lacustrine limestones (without cartographic expression in the \n\nFigure 1.6); Pliocene sands and clays; Pleistocene sandy and gravelly beaches and fluvial \n\nterrace deposits and, small outcrops of consolidate dunes; Holocene alluvial deposits, \n\ndunes and beach sands.  \n\n? Sintra Igneous Complex (82-95 Ma) is an intrusive mass body, mainly formed by syenites \n\nand granites, although it is possible to find gabbro-diorite and igneous breccia. Lisbon \n\nVolcanic Complex (70-72 Ma) is mainly composed by basalt, occurring in the form of \n\nvents, lavas, dikes and sills. Other igneous rocks associated with the earlier rifting phases \n\nof the North Atlantic Ocean, outcrop as veins of dolerite and teschenit among others. \n\nAssociated with the intrusion of igneous rocks, some contact metamorphic rocks also \n\noccur. \n\nThe geology of the shallower continental shelf is an extension the emerged geologic formations \n\nand structures. The inner shelf sector (up to 30-40 m depth) is composed by Jurassic and \n\nCretaceous sedimentary formations, except in front of the Roca Cape, in relation to the \n\nunderwater extension of the Sintra Igneous Complex (Figure 1.6). This bedrock is partially \n\ncovered by unconsolidated deposits, mainly composed by gravelly, coarse, medium and fine \n\nsand (IH, 2010). \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\nFigure 1.6.

(2002), \n\nADAPT (2015) and IPMA (2015). According to the information provided by these works, the \n\nclimate of the study area (i.e. between the coastline and the inland limit of the watersheds) is \n\ncharacterized by moderate temperatures with dry warm summer (K\u00f6ppen-Geiger classification). \n\nThe mean annual air temperature ranging between 13 and 18 ?C; and the mean annual \n\naccumulated precipitation increases from the coast to inland and do not exceed the 1000 mm. \n\nThe study coast has a semidiurnal mesotidal regime, with a spring tidal range averaging \n\n2.8- 2.9 m (Andrade et al., 2002), and is exposed to swells generated in the North Atlantic. \n\nAccording to the 56-years hindcast wave time-series obtained by Dodet et al. (2010), using a \n\nspectral wave model forced with reanalysis wind field and validated with buoy data, the \n\ndominant wave regime for the Portuguese west coast comes from NW. The W and SW waves \n\nhave lower frequencies and are typical of winter and autumn seasons (Figure 1.7). The average \n\noffshore wave conditions are characterized by a significant wave height of 2 m, a peak period of \n\n11 s and a direction of 308?.  \n\nThe summer directional spreading is particularly small compared to the other seasons, as result \n\nof the persistence of the NW waves (Figure 1.7). Summer/spring (April to September) wave \n\nclimate is characterized by a mean significant height of 1.5 m, a mean peak period of 9 s and a \n\nmean wave peak direction of 311?. In the winter/autumn (October to March), wave climate is \n\nquite energetic, being characterized by a mean significant height of 2.5 m, a mean peak period \n\nof 12 s and a mean wave peak direction of 306?; although maximum wave heights of 13 m and \n\npeak periods of 23 s, can be reached (Figure 1.8). According to the buoy data analysis performed \n\nby Costa and Esteves (2009), the most frequent storm conditions at the Portuguese western \n\ncoast, come from WNW and NW with maximum significant wave heights between 4 and 6 m \n\nand a duration usually less than two days. However, extreme cases can exceed 8 m and extend \n\nfor longer times. \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\nFigure 1.7.

However, terminology and limits \n\nof this region are not a consensual matter. Wright (1987) and Wright (1993), for example, define \n\ninner shelf or shoreface as the region immediately seaward the surf zone where waves agitate \n\nthe seabed. Smith (1995) also consider inner shelf and shoreface terms as being synonymous, \n\nbut define it as the region extending from the seaward edge of the surf zone to the closure \n\ndepth1. Notwithstanding, Niedoroda and Swift (1981) and Niedoroda et al. (1985), had \n\npreviously used the shoreface term to define the region between the surf zone and the inner \n\nshelf, considering that shoreface blends into inner shelf when the slope of the seabed reach \n\nvalues on the order of 1:2000. Cowell et al. (1999), on the other hand, define shoreface as the \n\n                                                           \n\n1 Closure depth is defined, for a given or characteristic time interval, as \u201cthe most Iandward depth seaward of which \nthere is no significant change in bottom elevation and no significant net sediment transport between the nearshore \nand the offshore\u201d (Kraus et al., 1998). \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n18 \n\nwave-dominated region, i.e. the region that extends from the limit of wave run-up on the beach \n\nface, seaward to the limit of effective influence by gravity waves in shaping seabed morphology. \n\nIn the present work, inner shelf term was adopted to define the subtidal zone where waves can \n\naffect seabed. Thus, the landward limit of the inner shelf was defined based on lowest water \n\nlevel (LWL), i.e. the hydrographic zero2 (ZH). Definition of the seaward limit, however, is more \n\ncomplex and may be based on oceanographic, morphological and sedimentological criteria, i.e \n\nthe depth corresponding to a wave base3, a slope break on the seafloor or to the offshore limit \n\nof the recent littoral sand deposits. Nevertheless, considering the main goal of the present work, \n\nthe use of the sedimentological criteria seems the most appropriate, as it reflects the sediment \n\ntransport conditions. \n\nDespite the poor sediment cover and irregularity of the sediment deposits of the continental \n\nshelf in the studied sector, the sedimentological map (IH, 2010), shows that the offshore limit of \n\nthe littoral sands deposits, occur in general, close to 40 m depth; the only observed exception is \n\nin stretch between Ericeira and Roca cape, where littoral sand extends up to 90/100 m depth, \n\nprobably due to a local structure or phenomena. The limit of the littoral sand deposits are in \n\nagreement with the slope breaks identified by Badagola (2008), in his morphological analysis of \n\nthe continental shelf in this sector. Despite the local variations, the limit identified at 30/40 m \n\ndepth seems consistent, considering other studies carried out in this and other sectors of the \n\nPortuguese western continental shelf (e.g. Dias, 1987; Taborda, 1999; Balsinha, 2008). \n\nTaking into account the previous considerations, it was assumed that inner shelf under analysis \n\nis located between LWL (2 m depth relative to the mean sea-level - MSL) and the depth that \n\nusually represent the offshore limit of recent littoral deposits (40 m depth relative to the MSL). \n\nThe inner shelf was divided into two domains, the upper domain that extends from LWL to the \n\nclosure depth, and the lower domain lying between the closure depth and 40 m depth (Figure \n\n2.1). Since there are no data or previous works regarding the accurate closure depth for the \n\nstudy site, the value estimated by Lapa et al. (2012), for the littoral north of Carvoeiro cape, \n\nwere considered valid for this work. According to these authors, closure depth range between \n\n11 m and 16 m depth (MSL), with a mean value of 14 m (MSL).  \n\n                                                           \n\n2 Is a nautical chart datum defined based on the Lowest Astronomical Tide Level that for the Portuguese main land is \nlocated 2 m below the mean sea level (according to information provided by Instituto Hidrogr\u00e1fico, available online \nat: http://www.hidrografico.pt/, accessed Oct. 2015). \n\n3 Is the depth beyond which \u201cwave action ceases to stir the sediments\u201d (Baker et al., 1966), corresponding about half \nthe wavelength in deep water. \n\nhttp://www.hidrografico.pt/noticia-sabia-que-zero-hidrografico.php\n\n\nInner Continental Shelf Geomorphology and Sedimentology \n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1. Beach and inner shelf limits adopted in this work. Depths are relative to the mean sea-level; HWL \nis the high water level and LWL is the low water level, in relation with the tide. \n\nThe main goal of this chapter was to investigate the possible sediment pathways and \n\ngeomorphological constrains to sediment transport on the inner continental shelf. To achieve \n\nthis goal a geomorphological and sedimentological analysis of the inner shelf was performed \n\nbased on bathymetric LiDAR, sedimentological data (mapping and samples), side-scan sonar \n\nsurvey, satellite images and orthophotomaps. \n\n METHODS \n\n LiDAR data analysis  \n\nBathymetric LiDAR data were acquired between June 22nd and August 19th 2011, with a spatial \n\nresolution of 2 m (Silva et al., 2012b). These data were validated by Instituto Hidrogr\u00e1fico (Moura \n\net al., 2014) and provided by Dire\u00e7\u00e3o-Geral do Territ\u00f3rio - DGT.  \n\nThe depth range surveyed by LiDAR is not uniform, hence the morphological analysis was \n\nperformed using a depth range well represented along the studied littoral, i.e. between -2 m \n\nand -10 m (MSL), covering a large part of the upper inner shelf. From the digital terrain model \n\nobtained, 71 profiles orthogonal to the depth contour lines were extracted, with a spacing of \n\nabout 1 km (along N-S direction). The small stretches front of Carvoeiro and north of Magoito, \n\nwere not characterized through this analysis, because LiDAR survey did not cover the area \n\ndeeper than the -10 m contour line. \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n20 \n\nWidth, mean slope and roughness of each profile were computed. The roughness was estimated \n\nusing the root mean square relative to a smoothed profile (computed through a moving average \n\nwindow of 10 m) according to the expression:  \n\n ???? = ?\n? (?? ? ????)\n\n2?\n?=1\n\n?\n (2.1) \n\nwhere ?? is the observed elevation, ???? is the moving average elevation and ? is the number of \n\nobservations. \n\nAdditionally, a detail morphological description of the inner shelf fronting most prominent \n\nheadlands (Carvoeiro, Lamporeira, Roca and Raso) was also held, based on total depth range \n\nobtained from LiDAR survey. \n\n Sedimentological data analysis  \n\nSedimentological analysis was based on sedimentological map of the Portuguese continental \n\nshelf IH (2010). In addition, an attempt to collect sediment samples on the upper inner shelf \n\ncontiguous to the Roca Cape was made, during the oceanographic campaign carried out by \n\nInstituto Hidrogr\u00e1fico on May 28th 2015. However, wave conditions only allowed sediment \n\nsampling at the lower inner shelf. Four sediment samples were collected, with a Smith-McIntyre \n\ngrab, between 30 and 40 m depth. \n\nSediment grain-size analysis was taken by sieving method for the particles larger than 1 ? and \n\nby laser diffraction for particles smaller than 1 ?. Both methods were performed according to \n\nthe internal protocols of Instituto Hidrogr\u00e1fico, which are based on the standards NP EN 933-1 \n\nand ISO 13320-1. The size grade scale adopted was the Wentworth scale modified by \n\nKrumbein (1934) and the statistic parameters of the grain-size distributions were computed \n\nthrough the method of moments described in Boggs (1995). \n\n Side-scan sonar data analysis  \n\nSide-scan sonar data were acquired by Instituto Hidrogr\u00e1fico, on February 9th and 11th 2015, \n\nusing a dynamically-focused multi-beam side-scan sonar KLEIN 5000, with a longitudinal \n\nresolution of 0.20 m and a pulse duration of 100 \u00b5s chirp to obtain a lateral range of 100 m. The \n\nsurvey cover an area of about 15 km2, approximately between 10 and 40 m depth, offshore the \n\nSintra coast. Data processing was performed using DELPH SONAR INTERPRETATION software of \n\nIXBLUE; time varying gain, speed and lateral range were corrected and the water column was \n\nremoved from the signal.  \n\n\n\nInner Continental Shelf Geomorphology and Sedimentology \n\n \n\n21 \n\nConsidering that the acoustic backscatter intensity depends on seafloor properties, this was \n\ncharacterized based on the different acoustic patterns identified, assuming that hard bottoms, \n\nsuch as rocky outcrops and coarse sediment result in a strong acoustic backscatter, while the \n\nsofter bottoms (fine sand and mud) generate a weaker acoustic return signal (e.g. Davis et al., \n\n1996; Collier and Brown, 2005; Hamouda et al., 2016). Moreover, height and wavelength of the \n\nbedforms identified, were also measured based on the acoustic shadows of these \u201cobjects\u201d, \n\nusing the slant range to the target object (time that the signal takes to return) and the height of \n\nthe side-scan above the seafloor. \n\n Satellite images and orthophotomaps analysis  \n\nLandsat 8 satellite images and orthophotomaps were used to get insights on the seabed \n\ncharacteristics. The satellite images were provided by National Aeronautics and Space \n\nAdministration - NASA and United States Geological Survey \u2013 USGS (available online at: \n\nhttp://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/, accessed between Dec. 2013 and Dec. 2015), while the \n\northophotomaps can be consulted online (available online at: http://mapas.dgterritorio.pt/, \n\naccessed Oct. 2015). \n\nThe image analysis was qualitative, consisting on a visual inspection to identify rocky and sandy \n\nbottoms and morphological features such sandbars. The latter can be directly observed or \n\ninferred from the breakers lines. The high frequency of Landsat 8 images allowed to characterize \n\nthe surf zone, during low- and high-energy wave conditions, and make considerations about how \n\nthis determines HSB processes. The orthophotomaps were used to confirm some aspects that \n\ncannot be clearly observed on the satellite images due to their lower resolution (30 m). \n\n RESULTS \n\n Inner shelf morphology \n\nThe inner shelf up to 10 m depth has an average width of 380 m, with a standard deviation of \n\n127 m. The narrower stretches are located front of Ribamar and immediately south of Carvoeiro \n\nand Roca capes, where the width decrease down to 155 m, 84 m and 16 m, respectively. Mean \n\nslopes are, in general, gentle and less than 2\u00b0 (92% of the observations). Steeper zones coincide \n\nwith the narrower stretches mentioned above, reaching a maximum of 25? at Roca cape. The \n\nroughness varies between 0.03 and 0.18 m and its spatial distribution indicate that stretches \n\nnorth of the headlands tend to be lesser rough than southern ones. This is particularly evident \n\nfront of prominent headlands, such as Lamporeira, Roca and Raso, although the same \n\nhttp://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/\nhttp://mapas.dgterritorio.pt/viewer/index.html\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n22 \n\nmorphological trend is observed at smaller headlands, such as Consola\u00e7\u00e3o and Peralta. \n\nExceptions to this trend are Carvoeiro cape, with a high-rough shelf at both sides, and Magoito \n\nheadland, where roughness is higher at the northern sector compared to the southern one \n\n(Figure 2.2).  \n\n  \n\nFigure 2.2. Morphological parameters of the inner shelf up to 10 m depth: (A) width, (B) mean slope and (C) \nroughness (40 m contour depth extracted from Vanney and Mougenot, 1981). \n\nDigital terrain models of the inner shelf in the vicinity of the most prominent headlands and \n\nrespective cross-shore bathymetric profiles show rough surfaces (Figure 2.3 and Figure 2.4). In \n\nthe case of Carvoeiro cape, the inner shelf plunges abruptly up to 5 m depth with a mean slope \n\nof 11?, and then extends as a large and rough submarine plateau with a mean slope of 0.4?; \n\nnorth and south sides of this headland have a narrow and steeper upper inner shelf, reaching \n\n\n\nInner Continental Shelf Geomorphology and Sedimentology \n\n \n\n23 \n\n15 m depth at 300/400 m from the coastline. At the Lamporeira headland region the inner shelf \n\nis shallower, comparatively to the other headlands, plunging gently up to 6 m depth with a mean \n\nslope of 0.6?. On the contrary, the inner shelf offshore Roca cape is deeper, plunging up to 13 m \n\ndepth with a mean slope of 4.8?; between 13 and 16 m depth, it becomes less steep with a mean \n\nslope of 1.4?; and then presents a shape almost horizontal. The inner shelf close to Raso cape, \n\npresents a horizontal platform around 3 m depth, becoming rougher and plunging up to 10 m \n\ndepth with a slope of 1.3?; from 10 to 17 m depth, mean slope increases to 6.9?, and then \n\npresents a surface approximately horizontal. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3.

Only \n\n52 % of the studied inner shelf is covered by unconsolidated sedimentary deposits, the \n\nother 48 % are rocky outcrops, which are preferably located offshore of prominent headlands. \n\nBetween Carvoeiro and Peralta headlands, the sedimentary cover is mainly composed by coarse \n\nsediments, such as gravels, gravelly sands and coarse sands; and some of these coarse deposits \n\nhave an important biogenic component. South of Peralta the sedimentary deposits are mainly \n\nmedium and fine sands, despite the existence of small stains of coarse and muddy sands. \n\nMedium sand deposits usually occur at depths shallower than 20 m, for greater depths fine sand \n\nbecame dominant. The stretch between Sta. Cruz and Ericeira is particularly rocky, while the \n\nstretch between Ericeira and Roca cape is the sandiest. \n\nThe four sediment samples collected in the framework of this study, at the lower inner shelf \n\nnear Roca cape, are mainly composed by fine sand (Figure 2.6), except sample S3 that \n\ncorresponds to rock and coral fragments. The sediment collected northern of Roca cape (S1 and \n\nS2) have mean grain-sizes of 2.46 and 2.34 ?, and a standard deviation of  0.54 and 0.58 ?; while \n\nthe sediment from southern side (S4) is slightly finer and less sorted, with a mean grain-size of \n\n2.84 ? and a standard deviation of 0.85 ?. The main differences observed between the sediment \n\nsamples and the sedimentological map, were found at sample S3 (Figure 2.5). Still, this \n\n\n\nInner Continental Shelf Geomorphology and Sedimentology \n\n \n\n25 \n\ndifference are acceptable, considering that map results from data interpolation and the time \n\ninterval between samplings. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5.

Grain-size distribution of inner shelf sediment samples. The depths measure by the vessel\u2019s probe \nduring sediment sampling (without any correction) were 33, 35, 34 m for samples S1, S2 and S4, respectively. \n\n Inner shelf seafloor texture and bedforms \n\nSide-scan sonar imagery presented in Figure 2.7, covers essentially the lower inner shelf \n\noffshore the coastal stretch between Magoito and Adraga. The light greys tones correspond to \n\nhigh backscatter intensity and dark greys tones to low backscatter intensity. \n\nThree main patterns were identified, the first one correspond to the areas with low backscatter \n\nintensity and smooth surfaces, typical of seafloors cover by fine sediment (Figure 2.7B). This \n\npattern occupies the larger part of the surveyed area and, considering the sediment distribution \n\nfrom Figure 2.5, it corresponds to fine sand. \n\nThe second pattern encompasses the areas with high backscatter intensity and large shadows \n\nindicating the high roughness of the seafloor (Figure 2.7B and Figure 2.7C). In these areas it is \n\npossible to observe linear features that should correspond to the stratification of a rocky \n\nsubstrate, probably from Jurassic formations (see Figure 1.6). The larger outcrop is located \n\noffshore Azenhas do Mar, but small outcrops can be found in the northern sector of the surveyed \n\narea. \n\nThe third pattern corresponds to small patches that also present high backscatter intensity, \n\nmorphologically smoother and presenting symmetric rhythmic forms oriented NE-SW (Figure \n\n2.7C and Figure 2.7D). These features indicate that this pattern corresponds to sediment \n\ndeposits, while its high reflectivity suggest that this sediment should be coarse. The rhythmic \n\nbedforms of the sediment located in the cavities of the larger rocky outcrop have a mean \n\nwavelength of 2 m and a mean height of 0.25 m.

The projection of the bathymetric contour obtained from LiDAR data on the \n\nimages suggest that sandbars are located mainly between 7 and 10 m depth (MSL). It can be \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n28 \n\nnoticed that the development of these sandbars is not constrained to the sectors front of the \n\nbeaches, extending in front of the rocky sectors, where usually get closer to the coastline. \n\nIn the case of stretches with a N-S to NW-SE general orientation, sandbar are absent and \n\nsometimes it is possible to observe rocky outcrops with patchy sand bodies, such as is the case \n\nof the inner shelf south of Consola\u00e7\u00e3o headland, where the stratification of the Jurassic \n\nformations can be noticed (Figure 2.8A). These structures, as well as the rocky seafloor offshore \n\nRibarmar (Ericeira) and downdrift Raso cape, were clearly observed in the orthophotomaps. \n\nThe analysis of the surf zone width, under different wave energy conditions, was performed in \n\ntwo coastal stretches with 9 km long. The first stretch, has a NE-SW general orientation and is \n\nlocated between Magoito and Adraga (Figure 2.9). The second stretch, is more crenulated, have \n\na N-S general orientation and is located northward Ericeira, between Baleia and Calada beaches. \n\nAs expected, under low-energy wave conditions the surf zone is narrow for both cases, being \n\nalmost imperceptive inside the deeper embayments (Figure 2.9A and Figure 2.10A). \n\nThe increase of the wave energy, increases the surf zone width. However, between Magoito and \n\nAdraga, the surf zone easier reach the tip of the headlands, extending continuously alongshore \n\nunder both moderated and high-energy wave conditions (Figure 2.9B and Figure 2.9C); while \n\nbetween Baleia and Calada beaches, the surf zone only extend outside the embayments, during \n\nhigh-energy events (Figure 2.10B and Figure 2.10C). \n\n\n\nInner Continental Shelf Geomorphology and Sedimentology \n\n \n\n29 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.8.

However, the morphological analysis shows that this is relatively \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n32 \n\nuniform with respect to the width and slope up to 10 m depth. Exceptions are downdrift sides \n\nof some headlands, where inner shelf is narrower and steeper, being Roca cape the most \n\nnotorious case.  \n\nSectors updrift the headlands typically have NE-SW orientations and lower roughness, indicating \n\nthat these should be sandier than downdrift sectors that generally have N-S and NW-SE \n\norientations and higher roughness. This is particularly evident at the most prominent headlands, \n\nsuch as Lamporeira, Roca and Raso (Figure 2.2). These results put in evidence the role of the \n\naforementioned headlands in the sediment retention and are supported by the presence of well-\n\ndeveloped outer sandbars, as well as by the sedimentological map and side-scan data that show \n\nsandier seafloors updrift these headlands. \n\nBathymetric profiles offshore most prominent headlands show that from the morphological \n\npoint of view, there are conditions for inner shelf bypassing. However, bypass occurrence is also \n\nconditioned by sedimentary constrains. \n\nSediment bypass of Carvoeiro cape seems difficult considering: (1) the rocky nature of the inner \n\nshelf around the headland; (2) its location at the tip of Peniche Peninsula that protrudes into the \n\nwater 2.5 km from the adjacent sandy coastline; (3) the inexistence of sand accumulation on the \n\nwestern jetty of Peniche harbour; and (4) the differences of the inner shelf sediment grain-size \n\nand composition north and south of the headland. The sedimentary cover of northern inner \n\nshelf is mainly composed by lithoclastic fine sands, while the southern one is composed by bio-\n\nlithoclastic coarse sands (Figure 2.5). Furthermore, longshore sediment pathway from updrift \n\nsector occurred in the past through what is today the Peniche isthmus (Calado, 1994). \n\nIn the case of Lamporeira, the inner shelf is shallow and have a low slope (Figure 2.4), favouring \n\nsediment bypass. Offshore Roca cape, inner shelf is very steep down to 13 m depth, with slope \n\ndecreasing seaward slope, becoming almost horizontal at 16 m depth (Figure 2.4). Under these \n\nconditions, the most likely is that sediment bypass occur either near the coastline or at depths \n\ngreater than 13 m. This hypothesis is acceptable considering that the closure depth ranges from \n\n11 to 16 m (Lapa et al., 2012), and the bedforms present in the inner shelf updrift of Roca cape \n\nat these depths. These bedforms have a symmetrical rhythmic patterns, typical of oscillatory \n\nflows, and a NE-SW orientation, orthogonal to the NW dominant wave conditions. Considering \n\nthe seafloor sediment cover near this headland, sediment bypassed at these depths should be \n\nmedium to fine sand (Figure 2.5). \n\nRaso cape has two distinct sectors with gentle mean slopes, a first one at 3 m depth and, a \n\nsecond one that extends from 17 m depth to deeper waters. Considering the closure depth \n\n\n\nInner Continental Shelf Geomorphology and Sedimentology \n\n \n\n33 \n\nmentioned before, the first pathway is the most plausible for the sediment bypassing. However, \n\nthe shallower sector of the inner shelf downdrift this headland, is extremely rocky (Figure 2.5). \n\nOrthophotomaps show that in this sector cliffs are hinged with a rocky submarine platform that \n\npresents a sediment cover very incipient close to the coastline. This sediment scarcity is \n\nobserved along 7 km between the Raso cape and the Cascais bay (Figure 2.8D), where the \n\ncoastline has a crenulated shape changing its orientation several times, favourable conditions \n\nfor sediment deposition. However, no significant littoral sediment accumulation is observed, \n\nincluding at the Cascais marina structure built in the later 90\u2019s. Under these conditions sediment \n\nbypassing of Raso cape should be negligible.  \n\nThe outer sandbars observed along the NE-SW oriented stretches, as well as the surf zone \n\nextension seaward the tip of the headlands, under moderate to high-energy wave conditions, \n\nindicate a sediment linkage of the submarine beach along these stretches. In the rockier \n\nstretches, located at NW-SE sectors, the coast present a more crenulated shape and the \n\nsediment linkage between deeper bays only seems possible during high-energy wave conditions.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n34 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n35 \n\n  \n\nBeach Morphology \n\n INTRODUCTION \n\nHeadland-bay beaches exhibit a wide range of sizes (from several tens metres to few \n\nkilometres), shapes and indentations. Morphological features of these beaches are distinct from \n\nsandy-coast beaches, because sediment transport is generally confined to the embayment. The \n\nthree-dimensional morphology of headland-bay beaches is the result of a closely relation \n\nbetween the cross-shore morphology (profile) and alongshore morphology (planform). A \n\ncommon feature of these beaches is the asymmetric shape of the planform, which is \n\ncharacterised by a curved zone, a gentle transition and/or a relatively straight tangential \n\nsegment on the downdrift end. Sometimes, the curved zone may not exist or the straight \n\ntangential section does not appear. The planform may even become symmetric between two \n\nheadlands in identical layout (Hsu et al., 2010). The long-term equilibrium state of the beach \n\nplanform has been extensively studied (e.g. Yasso, 1965; Silvester and Ho, 1972; Hsu et al., 1989; \n\nMoreno and Kraus, 1999; Klein et al., 2010; Daly et al., 2015),  as well as the short- to medium-\n\nterm beach clockwise/counter-clockwise rotation (e.g. Klein et al., 2002; Short and Trembanis, \n\n2004; Ranasinghe et al., 2004; Pinto et al., 2009; Thomas et al., 2010; Turki et al., 2013; Harley \n\net al., 2015). However, little attention has been given to the relationship between beach \n\nmorphology and headland sediment bypassing (HSB). Thus, the main goal of this chapter was \n\nthe description of the beach morphology along and across-shore to get insights on HSB \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n36 \n\nprocesses. To achieve this goal, a characterization of the beach planform geometry along the \n\nentire study coast was performed based on beach length, orientation, embayment degree and \n\nexposure to the dominant wave regime. The planform rotation and cross-shore morphology \n\nwere also analysed for a subset of the studied beaches and related with incident wave \n\nconditions. \n\n METHODS \n\n Wave data analysis \n\nFor a better interpretation of the results a hindcast wave time-series was used to characterize \n\nthe offshore wave climate between 2009 and 2015, which covers the time-interval of the \n\nmorphological data. The wave series (kindly provided by Professor Xavier Bertin, University of \n\nLa Rochelle) was obtained following the modelling strategy presented by Dodet et al. (2010). \n\nWave significant height (??), peak period (??) and peak direction (???), obtained for a time \n\ninterval of 6 hours, were used to characterise the seasonal and interannual wave conditions.  \n\n Beach planform analysis \n\n Planform geometry \n\nBeach planform geometry analysis was performed for all the sandy stretches observed on the \n\northophotomaps acquired on June 2012 and provided Direc\u00e7\u00e3o-Geral do Territ\u00f3rio \u2013 DGT. The \n\nplanform geometry can be described by a set of planform parameters (see for example Bowman \n\net al., 2009). In this work the following parameters were used (Figure 3.1): \n\n? Length and azimuth of the straight line between headland\u2019s tips (??); \n\n? Length and azimuth of the beach between headlands (?), which was assumed as the \n\nwet-dry line that matches the wave swash limit and typically represents berm crest \n\nposition; \n\n? maximum distance between the ?? and ? lines that corresponds the bay indentation \n\n(?); \n\n? distance between the ?? and ? lines close to the headlands that limit the beach system \n\n(?1 and ?2). \n\n?? and ? lines were manually vectorized on orthophotomaps at a fixed scale (1:5000), using the \n\nArcGIS v10.3 software. The ?, ?1 and ?2 distances were obtained through the orthogonal \n\n\n\nBeach Morphology \n\n \n\n37 \n\ndistances between ?? and ? lines, measured alongshore for a distance interval of 10 m, using \n\nthe Digital Shoreline Analysis v4.3 software (Thieler et al., 2009). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1. Parameters used to describe the beach planform geometry (example of Cani\u00e7al beach at \nLourinh\u00e3). ? is the beach stretch between headlands; ?? is the straight line between headland\u2019s tips; ? is the \nmaximum distance between the ?? and ? lines; and ? is the wave crest obliquity to ?? line. \n\nFollowing previous works (e.g. Klein and Menezes, 2001; Bowman et al., 2009) beach \n\nembayment index was obtained from the relation: \n\n ????????? ????? =\n?\n\n?? ??????\n (3.1) \n\nExposure to the dominant wave conditions was obtained based on the wave crest obliquity to \n\n?? line (?), as illustrated in Figure 3.1. Maximum and minimum beach exposure occurs when ? \n\nis 0 and ?90?, respectively. Thus, exposure index was computed according to the expression:  \n\n ???????? ????? = 1 ? (\n|?|\n\n90\n)  (3.2) \n\n? values were computed assuming the mean wave peak direction (307?) obtained from the 56-\n\nyears hindcast wave time-series provided by Dodet et al. (2010). \n\n Planform rotation \n\nThe analysis of beach planform evolution was performed using Landsat 8 images acquired \n\nbetween April 2013 and December 2015, with a 16 days revisit cycle. These images were \n\nprovided by National Aeronautics and Space Administration - NASA and United States Geological \n\nSurvey \u2013 USGS Landsat program (available online at: http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/, accessed \n\nbetween Dec. 2013 and Dec. 2015). \n\nThe beach stretches orientation was obtained based on the wet-dry line extracted from the \n\nsatellite images according to the flowchart presented in Figure 3.2. The images were pre-\n\nhttp://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n38 \n\nprocessed with the Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin of QGIS software that convert Landsat \n\nDigital Numbers (DNs) to Top of Atmosphere (TOA) Reflectance using the rescaling factors and \n\nparameters given in the Landsat metadata file. This image pre-processing consist in a \n\nradiometric correction and also included an atmospheric correction through the DOS1 method \n\n(Dark Object Subtraction 1). DOS is a simple atmospheric correction method that remove the \n\neffects of atmospheric scattering from an image by subtracting a pixel value that represents a \n\nbackground signature from each band (see details in Congedo, 2016). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2. Flowchart of the Landsat image analisys for wet-dry line extration and results validation. \n\nThe wet-dry line was extract automatically from the pre-processed images, using a toolbox \n\ncreated in the ArcGIS v10.3 software for this propose. This toolbox uses a Normalized \n\nDifferences Water Index (????) to identify wet and dry areas, assuming that wet sand appears \n\ndarker, i.e. less reflective than dry sand (Nolet et al., 2014). ???? is an arithmetic operation \n\nthat enhances the spectral signals by contrasting the reflectance between different wavelengths \n\nPre-processing\n\nWet-dry line extraction\n\nResults validation\n\nImage digital mumbers to \ntop of atmosphere (TOA) \n\nreflectance\n\nDark Object Subtraction \n\nNDWI raster \ncomputation and \n\nresampling\n\nNDWI reclassification\n(threshold value)\n\nWet-dry line \nvectorization\n\nR\nband 4\n\nSWIR\nband 7\n\nR\n\nSWIR\n\n\n\nBeach Morphology \n\n \n\n39 \n\n(e.g. Gao, 1996; McFeeters, 1996). In the present study ???? was computed based on the Red \n\n(?) and Short Wave Infra-Red (????) bands through the equation: \n\n ???? =  \n? ? ????\n\n? + ????\n (3.3) \n\nThe ???? obtained was resampled for a pixel with 5 m using the cubic method that calculates \n\nthe value of each pixel by fitting a smooth curve based on the surrounding 16 pixels. The \n\nresampled image was then reclassified based on a threshold value of 0.075 to separate wet and \n\ndry areas. Finally, the wet-dry limit was automatically vectorised. \n\nThe results of image analysis were validated with field data acquired at Guincho beach on 9th \n\nand on 16th July of 2014, at the same time of satellite image acquisition (Figure 3.2). In the first \n\ncase, during high-tide (3.08 m - MSL), and in the second case, during low-tide (0.73 m - MSL). \n\nThe comparison between the lines extract by image analysis and the measured ones have a root \n\nmean square error of 6.25 m, in the first case, and  9.75 m, in the second case, which are quite \n\ngood considering the 30 m image pixel resolution of the Landsat 8 images. However, many of \n\nthe studied beaches are narrow and the dry zone width is often close or within the pixel \n\nresolution. In this conditions the lines obtained usually correspond to the cliff\u2019s foot, producing \n\nunreliable results. Thus, the beach rotation analysis was performed only for beaches that usually \n\npresent larger dry areas. Considering this constraint, 13 beaches with different features and \n\nlocated at different coastal stretches, were chosen (Figure 3.3). Image analysis results for each \n\nbeach were excluded when the wet-dry limit coincides the cliff foot and when clouds cover the \n\narea under analysis.

Based on the \n\navailable dataset it was possible to identify and compare beach morphological features, such as \n\nbeach face slope and berm crest height.

The NW waves are \n\ndominant, while W and SW waves are less frequent and typical of winter/autumn seasons. The \n\nmain differences are the higher frequency of higher waves, typical of the winter/autumn season, \n\nand the greater directional spreading during summer/spring seasons, related with the higher \n\nfrequency of waves coming from NNW direction. The mean winter/autumn wave conditions \n\nexhibit a ?? of 2.5 m, a ?? of 12 s and a ??? of 306?, while mean summer wave conditions are \n\ncharacterized by a ?? of 1.9 m, a ?? of 10 s and a ??? of 315?. \n\n  \n\nFigure 3.6.

The box-plot diagrams in the Figure 3.7 indicate \n\nthat the years of 2013 and 2014 had a slightly higher frequency of higher waves. On the other \n\nhand, the years of 2012 and 2015 were characterized by the lowest maximum heights. The \n\nannual median peak periods varied between 11 and 12 s, being the highest wave period (23 s) \n\nreached in 2010 and 2014. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.7.

Boxes limits are \nthe 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively; the mid-range is the median value; and whiskers extremes are the \nmaximum and minimum values. Data provided by professor Xavier Bertin (University of La Rochelle). \n\nAnnual distribution of peak wave directional classes shows once again that waves coming from \n\nNW quadrant are dominant. The years of 2011 and 2013, were characterized by higher \n\nfrequency of NNW waves; while the years of 2009, 2010 and 2012 had higher frequencies of \n\nWSW waves. The most significant percentages of SSW waves occurred in the years of 2010 and \n\n2015 (Figure 3.8). \n\nA \n\nB \n\n\n\nBeach Morphology \n\n \n\n45 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.8. Relative frequency of peak wave directional classes: NNW (315-360?); WNW (270-315?); WSW \n\n(225-270?); SSW (180-225?). \n\n Beach planform \n\n Planform geometry \n\nResults of planform geometry show that studied beach length varies between 25 m and 3 km. \n\nThe longest beaches are located in the NE-SW oriented stretches, being Consola\u00e7\u00e3o beach, \n\nlocated at the north end of the study site, an exception. The results also show that the coastal \n\nstretch located between Paim\u00f4go and Lamporeira is the sandier (Figure 3.9A). \n\nBeach orientation varies between the 146\u00b0 and 247\u00b0 azimuths and coincides, in general, with \n\nthe general orientation of the coastal stretch where the beaches are hosted. Exceptions are the \n\ncases of Samarra beach, and same beaches located between S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o and Foz do Lizandro, \n\nwhere the most extreme case is the Coxos beach located immediately south of S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o \n\n(Figure 3.9B). \n\nThe most exposed beaches (to the NW dominant wave direction) are located at the coastal \n\nstretches with a NE-SW orientation, while the most sheltered beaches are at the stretches with \n\na NW-SE and NNW-SSE orientation (Figure 3.9C). \n\nBeach embayment index shows a more irregular distribution along coast. However, it can be \n\nnoticed that the most embayed beaches occurred preferably on the most crenulated stretches, \n\ni.e. nearby Roca cape and Paim\u00f4go, and between S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o and Foz do Lizandro. Also worth \n\nmentioning the isolated cases of Porto Novo and Samarra beaches (Figure 3.10A).  \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n46 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.9. Beach length (A), orientation (B) and exposure to the NW dominant waves (C).  \n\nThe distance between the berm crest and the tip of the headlands is, in general, shorter close \n\nto the southern limit. On the other hand, it can be also noticed that larger distances do not \n\nalways match with higher embayments, see for example Consola\u00e7\u00e3o beach and Abano beach \n\n\n\nBeach Morphology \n\n \n\n47 \n\n(north of Guincho) that have a similar embayment degree, but significant differences in distance \n\nto the tip of the headlands (Figure 3.10B). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.10. Beach embayment degree (A) and distance between the beach berm crest and the tip of the \nheadlands that limit the beach (B).  \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n48 \n\nConsidering the beach embayment degree and exposure to the dominant waves, Figure 3.11A \n\nshow that there is no direct relation between them. The beach exposure is related with the \n\nbeach orientation that as stated before is conditioned by the general orientation of the coast. \n\nHowever, it can be noticed that the two beaches (Samarra and Coxos) presenting ENE-WSW \n\norientations, have a high-degree of embayment (see Figure 3.3 and Figure 3.9). \n\nOn the other hand, it can be also noticed that the longest beaches (> 1 km) have NE-SW and \n\nNNE-SSW orientations, a low-degree of embayment and a high exposure to the dominant waves \n\n(Figure 3.11B and Figure 3.11C). Except Consola\u00e7\u00e3o beach, located at the north end of the \n\nstudied site, with a NNW-SSE orientation, a slightly higher embayment degree and a lower \n\nexposure. The shorter beaches have variable orientations, embayment degrees and exposures.  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.11. Relation between beach planform parameters: (A) embayment versus exposure; (B) embayment \nversus length; and (C) exposure vesrus length. Dots are projected with different colors representing beach \norientation. \n\n Planform rotation \n\nThe results of beach planform rotation show a coherent signal in time with a range that depends, \n\nonce again, on the orientation of the stretch where each beach is included. The northern \n\nbeaches (Consola\u00e7\u00e3o to Azul \u2013 see location in Figure 3.3) have minor variations, while the \n\nsouthern beaches present larger changes, mainly in the cases of Calada, S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o, Foz do \n\nA B \n\nC \n\n\n\nBeach Morphology \n\n \n\n49 \n\nLizandro and Ma\u00e7\u00e3s beaches (Figure 3.12). In general, beaches display a clockwise rotation \n\nduring summer that is particularly evident in August month, and a counter-clockwise rotation in \n\nthe winter. The asymmetry of box-plots, indicate that the clockwise rotations are more deviate \n\nfrom the median orientation than the counter-clockwise rotations (Figure 3.13).  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.12.

However, it is important to notice that the smaller range observed in 2013 can be \n\nrelated with inexistence of data for the first trimester of this year (Figure 3.14). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.14. Annual beach planform rotation for the period under analysis (April 2013 to December 2015). \nBoxes limits are the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively; the mid-range is the median value; and whiskers \nextremes are 1.5 times the interquartile range. \n\n Beach cross-shore morphology \n\n Profile morphology \n\nCross-shore morphology of the sta. Cruz beach was studied based on three profile: SCR1 at the \n\nnorthern sector, backed by a cliff; SCR2 at the central sector, backed by an artificialized dune; \n\nand SCR3 at the southern sector, backed by an artificial structure (Figure 3.15). During the \n\nmonitoring period this beach often presented one or two well-developed berms with a crest \n\nelevation between 2.4 and 6 m. The berm was usually wider and higher in the southern sector, \n\nexcept in March/June 2011, when the northern sector presented a particularly well-developed \n\nberm. The seasonal variability of the beach is reflected mainly by the berm advance and retreat, \n\nalthough sometimes it was possible to observe a more dissipative morphology. The most \n\nnotorious case occurred in March 2013, when all the beach profiles had a concave shape, typical \n\nof post-storm conditions. However, beach also showed a rapid recovery of its typical \n\nmorphology in the following months. In April 2014, beach profiles showed again a considerable \n\nretreat and the northern and central sectors reached its minima elevation on the upper part. \n\n\n\nBeach Morphology \n\n \n\n51 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.15.  Sta. Cruz beach profiles: SCR1 at the northern sector, SCR2 at the central sector and SCR3 at the \nsouthern sector. \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n52 \n\nCoxos beach profile is backed by a cliff and between 2011 and 2013 presented a well-developed \n\nberm with a crest elevation between 4 and 5.6 m. During this period, the morphological changes \n\nwere minor and related with the berm width and elevation. However, in January 2014, the beach \n\nprofile presented a concave shape, typical of post-storm conditions, with a lowering of the \n\ntopographic surface of about 3.5 m in the upper part. During the eighteen months afterward, it \n\ncan be noticed the beach did not recover its previous volume (Figure 3.16).     \n\n \n\nFigure 3.16. Coxos beach profiles. \n\nBaleia beach is backed by an artificial structure in all its extension and showed a very stable \n\nbehaviour during the monitoring period (Figure 3.17). The profiles showed that beach width \n\nincreases from north (BAL1) to south (BAL2). At the northern sector, the beach was narrower \n\nand does not developed a berm, while the central and southern sectors exhibited a summer \n\nberm that was eroded in winter. Berm crest elevation reached 5 m, in the central sector, and 4 \n\nm, in the southern sector. However, it must be acknowledged that some of the morphological \n\nfeatures are artificially reworked. For example, the berm of the central sector is artificially \n\nconstructed at the beginning of summer season, as observed during the survey of June 2014.  \n\nCentral and southern profiles showed an increasing of the elevation in the spring/summer, while \n\nthe northern profile slightly grows in the winter, suggesting a beach rotation process. The low-\n\ntide terrace of this beach often presented a roughness pattern related with the exposure of a \n\nrocky platform located just below mean sea-level.  \n\n\n\nBeach Morphology \n\n \n\n53 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.17. Baleia beach profiles: BAL1 at the northern sector, BAL2 at the central sector and BAL3 at the \nsouthern sector. \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n54 \n\nFoz do Lizandro profiles are backed by a dune, which was partially surveyed in the northern \n\nsector (LIZ1). This sector showed a lowering of the beach surface of about 2.5 m and a dune \n\nretreat of about 20 m, between February and April 2014. Southern profile (LIZ2) also showed \n\nlowering of the beach surface elevation of about 3 m, between January and June 2014. However, \n\nin June 2014, the northern sector of the beach already showed some recovering. In February \n\n2015, both profiles showed an accretion with the development of two berms, in the northern \n\nsector, and one berm, in the southern sector, with elevations between 2.8 and 4.9 m (Figure \n\n3.18).  \n\n  \n\nFigure 3.18. Foz do Lizandro beach profiles: LIZ1 at the northern sector and LIZ 2 at the southern sector. \n\nMagoito beach profiles are backed by cliffs and, during the monitoring period, often showed a \n\nsummer berm (with elevations between 2.3 and 3.5 m) that disappeared in the winter (Figure \n\n3.19). \n\n\n\nBeach Morphology \n\n \n\n55 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.19. Magoito beach profiles: MAG1 at the northern sector, MAG2 at the central sector and MAG3 at \nthe southern sector. \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n56 \n\nThe high roughness observed in some profiles of Magoito beach was related with exposure of \n\nthe rocky shore platform. Until March 2013, in the central sector (MAG2), the platform exposure \n\nonly occurred in winter months. However, from this date onwards the rocky platform have been \n\nexposed or covered with a thin sandy layer on the upper part without berm development. In the \n\nsouthern sector (MAG3), it was also observed considerably retreat of the beach in March 2013. \n\nDespite the recovery observed by the end of the year, in January 2014 beach retreated again \n\n(Figure 3.19).  \n\nMa\u00e7\u00e3s beach is backed by a dune that was surveyed during field campaigns. In October 2012, \n\nthe beach profile presented a wide berm (?100 m) with a crest elevation of 4.5 m. At the \n\nbeginning of 2014, a considerable beach retreat was observed with the berm obliteration, while \n\ndune showed a sand gain. In June 2014, dune presented a sand loss that according to the field \n\nobservation, resulted from the artificial removal to nourish the upper beach. During the year of \n\n2015, the beach gradually recovered and, in September 2015, a well-developed berm with a \n\ncrest elevation of 4 m was observed. However, the beach volume observed in 2012 was not yet \n\nreached (Figure 3.20).  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.20. Ma\u00e7\u00e3s beach profiles. \n\nGrande beach is backed by an artificial structure at the northern (GRA1) and central (GRA2) \n\nsectors, and by a cliff, at the southern sector (GRA3). This beach show an overall accretionary \n\ntrend between February 2014 and September 2015. In the summer period, presented a well-\n\ndeveloped berm with elevations between 2 and 4.4 m; while in the winter, the berm was \n\nobliterated and the subaerial beach was represented by a flat beach face. The beach profiles \n\nacquired in September 2014 showed that the north and south sections of the beach \n\n\n\nBeach Morphology \n\n \n\n57 \n\nexperimented an opposite behaviour (accretion of the northern sector and erosion of the central \n\nand southern sectors) related with the beach planform rotation process (Figure 3.21). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.21. Grande beach profiles: GRA1 at the northern sector, GRA2 at the central sector and GRA3 at the \nsouthern sector. \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n58 \n\nAdraga beach profile, located in a stream mouth, showed an accretive trend during the \n\nmonitoring period, presenting in all dates a well-developed berm with elevations ranging from \n\n2.3 to 4.4 m (Figure 3.22). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.22. Adraga beach profiles. \n\nGuincho beach is backed by dunes. In December 2009, this beach presented a typical winter \n\nmorphology without berms. Three months later, the northern sector (GUI1) showed the same \n\nmorphology, while the southern sector (GUI2) had experiment a significant erosion. In July 2014, \n\nbeach presented a well-developed berm with an elevation of 2.7 m, in the northern sector, and \n\n3.5 m, in the southern sector. However, beach surface was, in general, lower than the one \n\nobserved four years before. In November 2015, beach showed an accretion with berm advance, \n\nin the northern sector, and the increase of the berm elevation and the development of a second \n\nberm, in the southern sector (Figure 3.23). \n\nFigure 3.24 show the topographic profiles of several beaches: Azul (AZU), backed by dunes; Ba\u00edo \n\n(BAI) and Pequena (PEQ), backed by cliffs; and S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o (SLO) and Algodio (ALG), backed by \n\nartificial structures. The data acquired in February 2015 showed that S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o and Agodio \n\npresented berms with crest elevations of 6 and 3.5 m, respectively; while Ba\u00edo, Azul and Pequena \n\nbeaches had flat shapes. The comparison of the topographic surveys performed in the summer \n\nof 2014 and winter of 2015, showed minor variations at S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o beach, related with a \n\nslight erosion of the beach face and accretion of the berm. In the case of Pequena, beach surface \n\npresented higher elevations in the winter than in the summer. \n\nThe general aspect of the beaches, as well as some of the morphological aspect described above, \n\ncan be seen through the beach photo-monitoring program (see Appendix A). \n\n\n\nBeach Morphology \n\n \n\n59 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.23.

In the case of the beaches where more than one profiles were \n\nmonitored, average values are assumed. Beach face slope ranges between 4? and 9?, being \n\npossible to noticed that beaches located north of Foz do Lizandro (LIZ) tend to have higher \n\nslopes, indicating that these are more reflective than the southern ones (Figure 3.25A). Berm \n\ncrest elevation ranges between 3.6 m and 6 m relative to the MSL. The higher berm elevation \n\ncorrespond to the high-indented beaches of S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o (SLO) and Coxos (COX), but any trend \n\nalongshore can be noticed (Figure 3.25B).  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.25. (A) Mean beach face slope (tan ?) and (B) maximum berm crest elevation relative to MSL.  \n\n\n\nBeach Morphology \n\n \n\n61 \n\n DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS \n\nThe analysis of beach planform show that the longest and most exposed beaches are, in general, \n\nin the stretches with a NE-SW general orientation, being the sector between Paim\u00f4go and \n\nLamporeira the sandier. On the other hand, in the stretches with N-S and NW-SE general \n\norientation, beaches tend to be shorter and less exposed to the dominant waves. Consola\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nbeach is the exception to this trend, due to the sheltering effect of Peniche peninsula; it is the \n\nlongest beach of the studied coast and is located in a NW-SE oriented stretch (Figure 3.9 and \n\nFigure 3.11). \n\nBeach orientation is, in general, similar to the general orientation of the coastal sectors where \n\nthey are included. The most notorious exceptions are Samarra and Coxos beaches, which have \n\nan ENE-WSW orientation and a high-degree of embayment related with the local \n\ngeomorphology. Both beaches developed on narrow indentations with an alignment NNW-SSE \n\nand NW-SE, respectively (Figure 3.26). \n\nBeach embayment degree is conditioned by coastal geomorphology and do not have a direct \n\nrelation with the others planform parameters (Figure 3.11). \n\n  \n\nFigure 3.26. Plainview of (A) Coxos beach and (B) Samarra beach (ortophotomaps of 2012 provided by \nDirec\u00e7\u00e3o-Geral do Territ\u00f3rio - DGT). \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n62 \n\nPlanform rotation analysis show that beaches displays, in general, a clockwise rotation during \n\nsummer (Figure 3.13), which can be related to the NW (less energetic) incident wave conditions. \n\nThe persistence of these conditions induces an enlargement of the beach downdrift (southward) \n\n(Figure 3.27). This process can result in HSB through a continuous inner sandbar along the \n\nheadland coast, which migrates downdrift in the surf zone and weld to the downdrift beach, as \n\nit can be seen in the example of the Figure 3.28A. In the winter, a counter-clockwise rotation is \n\nobserved (Figure 3.28B). However, considering the wider distances observed between the beach \n\nberm and the northern headlands compared to the southern ones (Figure 3.10), and the less \n\npersistent W and SW incident wave conditions, HSB related with the beach rotation during \n\nwinter, seems more unlikely. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.27. Aspect of the Grande beach: (A) on 10th April 2014 (tidal level = 0.56 m MSL) and (B) on 31st \nAugust 2014 (tidal level = -0.66 m MSL). Tide levels were computed based on Cascais tide gauge data using \nthe UTIDE model (Codiga, 2011). \n\n\n\nBeach Morphology \n\n \n\n63 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.28. Aspect of the coastal strechet between Ma\u00e7\u00e3s and Adraga beaches: (A) on August 23rd and (B) on \nDecember 20th  2013 (Landsat 8 images provided by NASA and USGS). Tide levels for the time of the image \nacquisition were computed based of Cascais tide gauge data using the UTIDE model (Codiga, 2011). The mean \noffshore wave conditions (??, ?? and ???) for the 12 hours before the image acquisition,  were obtained \nfrom the wave time-series numerically modeled, provided by Professor Xavier Bertin, University of La \nRochelle. \n\nAnalysis of beach planform rotation also indicate that the beaches located north of Lamporeira \n\nheadland have minor variations, while the southern beaches present larger rotations (Figure \n\n3.12). However, in the case of Ma\u00e7\u00e3s beach, the rotation seems abnormally high, being probably \n\namplified by the influence of the Colares fluvial stream mouth on the shoreline orientation of \n\nthis short beach. \n\nBeach rotation increases with the decrease of the beach length (Figure 3.29), but is poor related \n\nwith beach embayment (Figure 3.30) or exposure to the dominant waves (Figure 3.31). Thus, \n\nthe differences between the beaches located north and south of Lamporeira headland, can only \n\nbe explained by a faster response of the shorter beaches to the incident wave conditions \n\ncompare to the longer ones. Despite the poor correlation between beach rotation and \n\nembayment degree, Figure 3.11 shows that longer beaches (>1 km), have low-degree of \n\nembayment, being the case of all beaches located north of Lamporeira for which planform \n\nrotation was studied. The low-degree of embayment of these beaches can justify their small \n\nrotation given that retention capacity of the headlands is smaller. Under these conditions, the \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n64 \n\nactive beach profile can easily reach the tip of headland, ceasing beach rotation due to the \n\nsediment bypass. \n\n  \n\nFigure 3.29.

Relation between beach rotation (computed using the 25th and 75th percentiles values of beach \norientation obtained from Landsat images) and beach exposure to the dominant waves. \n\nThe result of cross-shore morphological analysis show that beaches such as Baleia, Magoito and \n\nGrande, change between a convex shape, in the summer, due to a berm formation, and a \n\nconcave shape, in the winter, when the berm is obliterated. Sta. Cruz, Coxos, Ma\u00e7\u00e3s and Adraga \n\nbeaches, on the other hand, usually present convex shapes and the seasonal changes are more \n\nrelated with the berm elevation and width. In latter cases, the concave shape are less frequent \n\nand seems to be related with winter storm events. \n\nThe variations of the beach face slope alongshore indicate that beaches located north of Foz do \n\nLizandro, are more reflective than the southern ones. This could be an effect of the beach \n\nsediment grain-size, which tend to be coarse in the northern beaches (as shown in the Chapter \n\n4), being in agreement with previous works (e.g. Bascom, 1951). \n\nThe monitoring of the beach profiles showed, in general, higher beach retreats during the year \n\nof 2013 and 2014. In fact, these two years were particularity energetic, presenting the higher \n\nfrequencies of higher waves for the period under analysis (Figure 3.7).  The most energetic \n\nevents recorded during these years are related with the Gong storm occurred at January 19th \n\n2013 (see Liberato, 2014) and Christina storm occurred at January 6th 2014 (see Diogo et al., \n\n2014). According to the offshore wave data the average ??, ?? and ??? for these events were \n\n8 m, 13 s and 295?, in the case of Gong storm, and 7 m, 19 s, 297?, in the case of Christina storm.  \n\nThe morphological changes observed on beaches showed a variable response to these events. \n\nThe Gong storm, in 2013, had strong impact on Sta. Cruz and Magoito beaches (Figure 3.15 and \n\nFigure 3.19) and minor impact on the Baleia (Figure 3.17), while Coxos beach do not showed \n\nCRE\nGUI\n\nGRA\n\nMA\n\nLIZ\n\nSLO\nCAL\n\nAZU\nSCR\n\nSRI\nPER\n\nABR\nCON\n\ny = 14.59x\nR\u00b2 = 0.10\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0\n\nR\no\n\nta\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\n\u00b0)\n\nExposure index\n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n66 \n\nsignificant changes, probably due to its higher degree of embayment (Figure 3.16). However, in \n\nthe case of the Christina storm, in 2014, the impacts are visible in all beaches, including Coxos \n\nbeach. The main difference between these two storms is the wave period, which was quite \n\nlonger in case of Christina storm. This storm triggered the Foz do Lizandro dune retreat (Figure \n\n3.18) and the lowering of topographic surface at the Coxos, Ma\u00e7\u00e3s and Grande beaches (Figure \n\n3.16, Figure 3.20, Figure 3.21). The impacts of this storm in these and other beaches are also \n\nreported by Diogo et al. (2014), Carapu\u00e7o et al. (2014) and Bastos et al. (2015).  \n\nThe morphological changes observed at Coxos beach, showed that on high-incised beaches, \n\nsediment can leave the embayment during particular extreme meteorological events. Under \n\nthese conditions, waves induce strong erosion on the subaerial beach and a large volume of \n\nsediment is transported outside the embayment and, eventually, bypass the headlands. \n\nThe data obtained after storms showed a gradual recovery of the beaches with the increasing \n\nof the beach surface elevation or/and the berm advance. However, Coxos beach recovery seems \n\nto be slower when compare to the other beaches. \n\nTable 3.2 shows the comparison between sand volumes estimated for Coxos and Ma\u00e7\u00e3s beaches \n\nbased on their beach profiles (above a common minimum elevation between surveys), before \n\nand after the storm events of 2014; and assuming that volume of the Ma\u00e7\u00e3s beach, before the \n\nstorms of 2014, was not significantly different to the one measure in 2012. Ma\u00e7\u00e3s beach lost \n\nabout 62 % of the initial sand volume, while Coxos lost about 78 %. \n\nTable 3.2.

Although the Ma\u00e7\u00e3s beach has been nourished \n\nwith sand removed from the dune, as already mentioned, the beach profiles showed that larger \n\npart of sand volume was recovered through a natural process (Figure 3.20). The fast recovery of \n\nthis beach can be then explained by its lower embayment, which allowed the capture of the \n\nsand bypassing near the shore, as explained previously (Figure 3.28A). On the contrary, the \n\nhigher indentation of the Coxos beach is not favourable to this HSB process. In this case, the \n\nbeach is feed by the sediment transport shoreward during low-energy wave conditions, which \n\nshould have a low magnitude considering the rocky nature of adjacent inner shelf (see Chapter \n\n2) and, justifies its slower recovering. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n68 \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n69 \n\n  \n\nBeach Sedimentology \n\n INTRODUCTION \n\nSediment particles properties such as grain-size, shape and composition provide valuable \n\ninformation about sediment sources, transport processes and pathways. Clemens and Komar \n\n(1988), for example, used the heavy mineral content and the degree of grain rounding of sands \n\nto identify sediment sources, trace transport paths and to obtain additional information \n\nconcerning the history of the sediment particles on the Oregon headland-bay coast (USA); \n\nFerrari et al. (2014) used grain-size, composition and shape of sedimentary particles to trace \n\nsediment bypass between two adjacent gravel pocket beaches of the Ligurian Sea (Italy); and \n\nCascalho et al. (2014) identified a sediment sorting during subaerial bypass at Nazar\u00e9 headland \n\n(Portugal), based on the sediment grain-size. \n\nFollowing these works, beach sediment grain-size and composition were used to get further \n\ninsights on sediment sources and distribution processes in order to understand the headland \n\nsediment bypassing (HSB) processes. However, considering the large extension of the studied \n\ncoast (about 100 km), the sediment sampling was focus in a shorter stretch, located between \n\nSta. Cruz (Torres Vedras) and Guincho (Cascais) (Figure 4.1). The results obtained were discuss \n\nconsidering the sedimentological information of the previous works, which are listed in the \n\nTable 4.1. \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n70 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1.

Most sediment samples correspond to the first centimetres of the surficial layer, however, \n\nsuperficial sediments correspond to the sedimentary particles that are in equilibrium with the \n\neffective wave conditions and might not be representative of the entire beach system. Thus, a \n\nsampling procedure that following the recommendations of the Beach Sand Code Project (2012) \n\ntechnical note, was also used in order to characterize the beach sediment average \n\ncharacteristics (composite sediment samples). These samples were collected at the beach face, \n\nusing a PVC tube with 4.5 cm of diameter and 50 cm of length (Figure 4.2A and Figure 4.2B). The \n\nonly exception was the sediment sampled at Grande beach on February 2014, which was \n\nmanually collected and corresponds to the 32 cm of thickness of the heavy mineral deposit \n\nobserved (Figure 4.2C). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n72 \n\nTable 4.2.

Both methods were performed according to \n\nthe internal protocols of Instituto Hidrogr\u00e1fico, which are based on the standards NP EN 933-1 \n\nand ISO 13320-1. The size grade scale adopted was the Wentworth scale modified by Krumbein \n\n(1934) and the statistic parameters of the grain-size distributions were computed through the \n\nmethod of moments described in Boggs (1995). \n\nA \n\nB \n\nC \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n74 \n\n X-ray diffractometry analysis \n\nX-ray diffractometry is a technique usually applied to obtain the mineralogy of silty-clay \n\nsediments. However, according to the works presented by Hein et al. (2013), Armstrong-Altrin \n\net al. (2014) and Oliveira et al. (2015), this technique can be used as a first approach to get \n\ninsights on the major mineral phases (> 2%) present in coarser sediment using a bulk of milled \n\nsample. Thus, sediment samples were milled to get a powder with a median grain-size of 100 \n\n\u00b5m (3.3 ?). The mineralogical analysis was performed using a PANalytical diffractometer, with a \n\nCuK? radiation. Scans were run between 4? and 60?, with a 0.02\u00b0 per 2? step and a counting \n\ntime of 1 second. Mineral relative abundances was determined based on the x-ray diffractogram \n\npeak areas, being the basal reflections of the main minerals weighted by empirically factors \n\nfollowing the criteria presented by Rocha (1993). Due to technical problems with diffractometer, \n\nthe samples of Azul, Abano and Guincho beaches were not analysed. \n\n Magnetic susceptibility analysis \n\nMagnetic susceptibility is a fast and non-destructive assessment of the concentration of iron-\n\nbearing magnetic minerals that according to the work presented by Shankar et al. (1996), can \n\nbe used as a proxy for heavy mineral content of the sediment. In mathematical terms, magnetic \n\nsusceptibility (?) is defined as the ratio between induced magnetization per volume unit of \n\nmeasured sample (?) and applied magnetic field intensity (?). Since ? and ? have the same SI \n\nunits (Am-1), ? is a dimensionless number (Dearing, 1999). \n\nThis technique was applied to get insights on sediment heavy mineral content of all composite \n\nsamples. Before measuring magnetic susceptibility, sediment samples were washed with \n\ndistilled water, dried and well mixed in plastic containers. The measurements were performed \n\nwith the sediment inside plastic containers, using a Bartington MS2E sensor, which measures \n\nthe magnetic susceptibility with a high spatial resolution (3.8 mm). To avoid anomalous values, \n\n15 measurements at different points were taken for each sample and a median value was \n\nassumed.  \n\n Heavy minerals analysis \n\nThe heavy mineral analysis was performed on a subset of the composite samples (see Figure \n\n4.1) to complement and validate the results of magnetic susceptibility. Heavy minerals are \n\nusually concentrated in the grain-size classes of medium to very fine sand. However, the \n\nsediments under analysis reveal low frequencies of very fine sand, thus the heavy mineral study \n\nwas performed only for the grain-sizes ranging between medium and fine sand (1-3 ?). The \n\n\n\nBeach Sedimentology \n\n \n\n75 \n\nweight percentage of heavy fraction was firstly computed based on the ratio between heavy and \n\nlight mineral weights and secondly was weighted on the total sediment weight. \n\nThe preparation of the samples included the elimination of carbonates using a 10 % solution of \n\nhydrochloric acid (HCl). After, sand fractions were washed and dried and, heavy and light \n\nminerals were separated using bromoform (density = 2.89). The required amount of grains for \n\neach microscopic slide was obtained using a micro-splitter and then mounted in Canada balsam \n\non glass slides. Mineral particles identification and counting under the petrographic microscope \n\nwas performed according to the ribbon method (Galehouse, 1971 in Mange and Maurer, 1992). \n\nThe percentage of each mineral specie (in each sample) was computed based on the total \n\nnumber of grains counted (about 600 grains per sample).  \n\n Principal components analysis  \n\nCompositional data interpretation was supported by the principal components analysis (PCA). \n\nThis analysis was applied in order to reduce the number of possibly correlated variables (i.e. \n\nmineral species) into a fewer uncorrelated variables (principal components) that are linear \n\ncombinations of the original ones. The objective of this analysis is to reduce the number of \n\nvariables of the data set, but retain as much of the original variability in the data as possible. \n\nTwo PCA were performed using the STATISTCA software. The first one explore the major \n\nminerals phases of the sediment, while the second one explore the main transparent heavy \n\nminerals identified. \n\n RESULTS \n\n Beach sediment grain-size \n\nThe grain-size distributions of the composite samples show that beach sediment is mainly \n\ncomposed by coarse sand (1 ? to 2 ?) with a modal class of 0.75 ?, in the most cases, or 0.25 ?, \n\nin the cases of Calada and Coxos beaches. Exceptions are S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o beach that is mainly \n\ncomposed by very coarse sand (0 ? to -1 ?) and present significant percentages of gravel (-1 ? to \n\n-2 ?); and the placer sediment (collected at Grande beach) that is mainly composed by medium \n\nsand (1 ? to 2 ?) (Figure 4.3). \n\nThe superficial sediment samples are also mainly composed by coarse sand with a model class \n\nof 0.75 ?. Nevertheless, Calada beach sediment presented, once again, a slightly coarser mode \n\n(0.25 ?). The sediment sampled at Adraga and Grande low-tide terrace and at Coxos submarine \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n76 \n\nbeach showed higher percentages of medium sand particles (1-2 ?); in the latter case, it can be \n\nalso noticed an increasing of fine sand particles (2-3 ?) (Figure 4.4).  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.3. Grain-size distributions curves of the composite samples. The dashed line corresponds to the \nplacer sample collected at Grande beach.

In what concerns to the beaches where both sampling methods were applied, it can \n\nbe noticed that, Ba\u00edo, Calada, Coxos and Ma\u00e7\u00e3s composite sediment is clearly coarser and less \n\nsorted than the superficial sediment, in opposition to Foz do Lizandro, Pequena, Grande, Adraga \n\nand Guincho, which have slightly differences. On the other hand, low-tide terrace sediment \n\ncollected at Adraga and Grande beaches is finer and well sorted than the one collected at Coxos, \n\nbut have a mean grain-size similar to the Coxos submarine beach sediment (Figure 4.5). \n\n \n\nFigure 4.5.

In the lengend beaches are presented from south to north. \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n78 \n\nConsidering the mean grain-size, most of sediment samples are classified as coarse sand; \n\nexceptions are the sample collected at S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o, a very coarse sand, and the samples \n\ncollected at the low-tide terrace of the Grande and Adraga beaches, at the submarine beach of \n\nCoxos and at placer of the Grande beach, classified as medium sand. \n\n Beach sediment composition \n\n Major minerals \n\nX-ray diffractometry results show that the beach sediments under analysis are mainly composed \n\nby quartz, calcite and potassium feldspar, with median percentages above 17 %. Dolomite, \n\naragonite, plagioclase and hematite have lower percentages that do not exceed 5 % (Figure 4.6). \n\nThe placer sample collected at Grande beach has a peculiar mineral assemblage, mainly \n\ncomposed by heavy minerals, such as ilmenite (37 %), magnetite (30 %), hematite (12 %), garnet \n\n(8 %) and zircon (6 %), while light minerals such as potassium feldspar, calcite and quartz have \n\nresidual percentages (? 3 %). \n\n \n\nFigure 4.6. Major minerals of sediment (QTZ \u2013 quartz; CAL \u2013 Calcite; FELK - potassium feldspar; DOL \u2013 \ndolomite; ARG \u2013 aragonite; PLG \u2013 plagioclase; HEM \u2013 hematite; ZIR \u2013 zircon; GAR \u2013 garnet; MAG \u2013 magnetite; \nILM \u2013 Ilmenite). The box-plots are divided by the 50th percentile, while its limits are the 25th and 75th \npercentiles; the whiskers represent the maximum and minimum values. The mineralogy of the placer sample \ncollected at Grande beach is represented separately by dots. \n\nThe relative percentages of major minerals obtained for each beach show an increasing of \n\ncarbonate content from north to south, mainly related with calcite and aragonite percentages. \n\nCalada and S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o beaches stand out due to the highest percentages of quartz (60 % and \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\nQTZ CAL FELK DOL ARG PLG HEM ZIR GAR MAG ILM\n\n%\n \n\nMineral\n\nGRAplacer sample\n\n\n\nBeach Sedimentology \n\n \n\n79 \n\n78 %, respectively) and dolomite (20 and 11 %, respectively). The results also put in evidence \n\nthe significant differences between Grande beach sediment collected during modal (GRA \n\nsample) and after-storm conditions (GRAplacer sample). In the first case, sediment presents a \n\nmineralogical signature not much different from the adjacent beaches, dominated by light \n\nminerals, while in the second case the sediment is dominated by heavy minerals as previously \n\nmentioned (Figure 4.7). \n\n \n\nFigure 4.7.

The beaches located north of \n\nLamporeira headland (Sta. Cruz, Azul and Ba\u00edo) have a magnetic signal almost null. South of this \n\nheadland, magnetic signal tends to increase, reaching the highest values at Grande beach, which \n\nare up to two orders of magnitude higher. South of Grande beach magnetic signal back to \n\ndecrease (Figure 4.8A). Placer sample have a magnetic signal extremely high with a median \n\nvalue of 7.1\u00d710-1, 30 times higher than the median value obtained for modal conditions \n\n(2.3\u00d710- 2) (Figure 4.8B). \n\n \n\nFigure 4.8. Magnetic susceptibility of beach sediment: (A) \u201cregular\u201d samples and (B) placer sample of the \nGrande beach. The box-plots are divided by the 50th percentile, while its limits are the 25th and 75th \npercentiles; the whiskers represent the maximum and minimum values.   \n\n Heavy minerals \n\nHeavy mineral content (expressed in weight percentage) increases from Azul to Grande and \n\ndecreases from Grande to Guincho. The heavy mineral percentages found at Grande beach are \n\nsignificantly higher than the ones observed at the other beaches. The placer sample collected in \n\nthis beach reveal a heavy mineral concentration 25 times higher than the one found in the \n\n\u201cregular\u201d sediment sample (Figure 4.9).  \n\nThe lower percentages of heavy mineral fraction found at Azul beach did not allow to obtain a \n\nnumber of heavy mineral particles with statistical significance. Thus, the results of heavy mineral \n\n\n\nBeach Sedimentology \n\n \n\n81 \n\nspecies of Azul beach were not considerate. Fourteen transparent heavy mineral species were \n\nidentified under the petrographic microscope, but only half of these species have median \n\npercentages greater than 1 %. Those minerals are: tourmaline (24.5 %), clinopyroxene (21.3 %), \n\ngarnet (18.4 %), staurolite (15.4 %), andaluzite (7.2 %), amphibole (5.0 %) and zircon (1.2 %). \n\nEpidote and rutile are less abundant (? 0.5 %) and apatite, titanite, biotite, cyanite and sillimanite \n\nare vestigial (Figure 4.10). \n\n \n\nFigure 4.9.

Exception are: (1) the very coarse sand of Louren\u00e7o beach; (2) the medium sands \n\ncollected at low-tide terrace of the Grande and Adraga beaches and at the submarine domain \n\nof the Coxos beach; and (3) the medium sand of the Grande beach placer, collected after a major \n\nstorm (Figure 4.3, Figure 4.4 and Figure 4.5).  \n\nThe sediment grain-size analysis was limited to the beaches located in the stretch between Sta. \n\nCruz and Guincho. To have a wider view of the grain-size variations along the study coast, the \n\nmean grain-size of superficial beach face sediment samples was projected together with the \n\nmean grain-size of the beach face sediment analysed in previous works (Figure 4.14A). Despite \n\nthe constrained imposed by the different number of samples used to estimate the average \n\nvalues of each beach, as well as the differences in the sediment sampling date and method, it \n\ncan be noticed that coarser sediment are in the stretches with a N-S and NW-SE general \n\norientation (the rockier inner shelf sectors as shown in the Chapter 2). \n\nComposite sediments allowed a better characterization of the beaches alongshore, showing that \n\nbeaches located north of the Foz do Lizandro, particularly, in the stretch between Lamporeira \n\nand Foz do Lizandro, tend to be coarser than the southern ones (Figure 4.14B). This trend is \n\ncompatible with a selective sediment transport process southward, where finer particles bypass \n\nthe headlands, while coarser ones are trapped inside the bays. \n\nPrevious assumption is also supported by the field observations at Ursa beach, where the rocks \n\nof the Sintra Igneous Complex contact with the Jurassic superior limestones. The cobbles and \n\nboulders particles resulting from the erosion of the referred rocks showed a weak mixture inside \n\nthe bay, suggesting that gravel particles have low transport rates and are trapped inside the bays \n\n(Figure 4.15). \n\nThe sediment grain-size decreasing observed towards offshore, along the Coxos, Grande and \n\nAdraga beaches profiles also support the existence of a selective transport process. In the first \n\ncase, sediment of the beach face and low-tide terrace was composed by coarse sand that gave \n\nplace to medium sands at the submarine beach; while in the two latter cases, the coarse sands \n\nof beach face gave place a medium sand at the low-tide terrace. The medium sand found at the \n\nlower beach domains is in agreement with the inner shelf medium sand deposits mapped by IH \n\n(2010) up to 10/20 m depth, where they gave place to fine sands. These results indicate once \n\nagain that coarser particles remain inside the bays, while finer ones are transported offshore \n\nand, eventually, bypass the headlands.  \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n86 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.14. Longshore distribution of the beach sediment grain-size based on: (A) average of mean grain-size \nof the superficial sediment collected at the beach face in the scope of this and other works (Oliveira, 2009; \nTrindade and Ramos-Pereira, 2009; Balsinha et al., 2010; Pires and Ribeiro, 2010; Gusm\u00e3o, 2010; Silveira et \nal., 2013); and (B) mean grain-size of the composite sediment samples. \n\n\n\nBeach Sedimentology \n\n \n\n87 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.15. (A) General aspect of the Ursa beach, located in the stretch between Adraga and Roca cape, at \nJune 11th 2014: contact between the Jurassic limestones (northeast) and the rocks of Sintra Igneous Complex \n(southwest), and the respective, detrital deposits resulting from the cliffs erosion; (B) contact \nmetamorphosed limestone (white cobbles), granite and syenite (pink cobbles) and gabbro and basalt (black \ncobbles); (C) aspect of the cobbles mixture at the low-tide terrace. \n\nDespite the selective process identified alongshore, there are grain-size variations that should \n\nbe related with geomorphological constrains and/or local sediment sources, being the most \n\nnotorious case the S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o beach (Figure 4.14B). \n\nThe mean grain-size of composite sediments was projected against the beach embayment index, \n\nbut a weak relation was found (Figure 4.16), suggesting that the coarser sediment of S\u00e3o \n\nLouren\u00e7o can be directly provided by the Safarujo river. The same can be assumed for Ma\u00e7\u00e3s \n\nbeach, located at the Colares river mouth, that has a coarser sediment compared to the nearby \n\nbeaches (Figure 4.14B). \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n88 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.16. Relation between mean grain-size of composite sediments and beach embayment index. \n\nThe compositional analysis shows that beach sediment is mainly composed by quartz, feldspar \n\nand carbonate particles, except in the particular case of placer deposit. Despite some local \n\nvariations, such as the higher percentages of quartz and dolomite of the Calada and S\u00e3o \n\nLouren\u00e7o beaches that could be related with the local sediment sources, the only trend observed \n\nalongshore is the increase of carbonate content southward, mainly calcite (Figure 4.7). However, \n\nthe origin of the carbonate particles was not clarified, so it cannot be used for sedimentary \n\ndynamics proposes. Moreover, these results must be viewed with some caution, because they \n\ncorrespond to a first attempt to study the mineralogy of these sediments. The latter tests \n\nperformed by Oliveira et al. (2016), show that median grain-size of the powder used in these \n\nanalysis can lead to inaccuracies in the relative percentages of the mineral phases. \n\nThe transparent heavy mineral assemblages found in the beaches between S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o and \n\nGuincho are quite similar and, are in agreement with mineral assemblages observed by Balsinha \n\net al. (2010) in the beaches located between Peniche and Foz do Lizandro. This mineralogical \n\nhomogeneity impedes tracing sediment sources and transport pathways. According to the work \n\npresented by Cascalho et al. (2016), held in conjunction with this work, the mineralogical \n\nhomogeneity of these beaches can be explained by the great variety of lithological types \n\n(sedimentary, igneous and contact metamorphism rocks) found in the watersheds drained to \n\nthe littoral. \n\nDespite the few samples, the correlation between magnetic susceptibility and the weight \n\npercentage of heavy mineral was good, allowing the use of the magnetic signal as a proxy for \n\nGUI \n\nABA\n\nADR\nGRA\n\nPEQ \n\nMA\nMAG\n\nLIZ\n\nALG\n\nCOX\n\nSLO\n\nCAL\n\nBAI\nAZU\n\nSCR\n\ny = -0.25x + 0.35\nR\u00b2 = 0.25\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n-1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5\n\nE\nm\n\nb\na\n\ny\nm\n\ne\nn\n\nt \nin\n\nd\ne\n\nx\n\nMean grain-size (?)\n\n\n\nBeach Sedimentology \n\n \n\n89 \n\nthe heavy mineral concentration (Figure 4.17).

The high content of heavy minerals of the Grande beach sediment, compared to the other \n\nbeaches, only can be explained by a long-term cumulative process promoted by the Calhau do \n\nCorvo headland at the downdrift limit of the beach. This headland is originated by the outcrop \n\nof Cretaceous limestone compact rocks exhibiting a subvertical stratification and a direction \n\napproximately perpendicular to the general orientation of the coastline, being a natural \n\nstructural barrier to the longshore drift. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.17. Relation between magnetic susceptibility (median value) and the weight percentage of heavy \nminerals. \n\nThe heavy mineral placer deposit observed at Grande beach resulted from an efficient grain \n\ndensity sorting induced by the storm events occurred in the begging of 2014 (also mentioned in \n\nChapter 3). Nonetheless, the large size of this deposit and its peculiar mineralogy, which include \n\nhigh percentages of ilmenite, magnetite, hematite, garnet, staurolite and zircon, should result \n\nfrom the combination between the referred long-term cumulative process, promoted by the \n\nCalhau do Corvo headland, and a short-term process related with the sorting promoted by the \n\nstorm event.  This assumption is in agreement with the model proposed by Peterson et al. \n\n(1986), based on their observations at the headland-bay coast of Oregon (U.S.A). According to \n\nthese authors, placers development is controlled by shoreline configuration, as the first-order \n\nfactor, and seasonal variations of wave climate and longshore currents, as second-order factors. \n\ny = 0.0092x\nR\u00b2 = 0.9999\n\n0.00001\n\n0.0001\n\n0.001\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n0.00 0.01 0.10 1.00 10.00 100.00\n\nM\na\n\ng\nn\n\ne\nti\n\nc \nsu\n\nsc\ne\n\np\nti\n\nb\nil\n\nit\ny\n\n (\n-)\n\nWeight % of the heavy mineral content\n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n90 \n\nThese results show once again a selective bypassing process, where the heavier particles are \n\ntrapped inside the embayment, while the lighter ones are transported offshore; once lighter \n\nparticles reach the tip of the headlands, they can be entrained by the longshore flows and bypass \n\nthe headlands. This selective process is particularity efficient during high-energy conditions.  \n\nConcluding, beach sediment textural and compositional analyses indicate that HSB is a selective \n\nprocess. According to the results its can assumed that coarser particles such gravel and very \n\ncoarse sand tend to be trapped inside the embayments, being their bypass very low or negligible. \n\nCoarse sand bypass occur mainly at the subaerial beach, considering the high frequency of these \n\nparticles in the beach face and low-tide terrace sediments. Their bypass should occur in relation \n\nwith the beach rotation process, as explained in the previous chapter; except during major storm \n\nevents, when the wave energy triggers an extreme efficient selective process, transporting the \n\nlighter sediment particles towards offshore (including coarser sands), originating heavy mineral \n\nplacer deposits on subaerial beach. In the case of medium sand particles, headland bypass can \n\noccur either subaerial beach or inner shelf domain, depend on the wave energy; while fine sand \n\nbypass occur mainly at the inner shelf, considering the low frequency of these particles in the \n\nbeach sediments and fine sand deposits of the inner shelf.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n91 \n\n  \n\nLongshore Sediment Transport \n\n INTRODUCTION \n\nLongshore sediment transport or longshore drift plays a major role in coastal processes. Intense \n\nefforts have been made to estimate longshore drift with the development of empirical formulas \n\nbased on laboratory tests and field experiments data (e.g. Komar and Inman, 1970; CERC, 1984; \n\nKraus et al., 1988; Kamphuis, 1991), numerical models (Hanson, 1989; Larson et al., 2002; Trouw \n\net al., 2012), and through field measurements, such as sediment accumulation rates in harbours \n\nor groins (see the database summarized by Schoonees and Theron, 1993), short-term sediment \n\nimpoundment (Bodge and Dean, 1987), sediment tracers (Ingle, 1966; Komar and Inman, 1970; \n\nDuane and James, 1980; Kraus et al., 1981; Taborda et al., 1994; Ciavola et al., 1997; Vila-Concejo \n\net al., 2004; Tonk and Masselink, 2005; Silva et al., 2007; Fern\u00e1ndez- Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2015), \n\nstreamer sediment traps (Kraus and Dean, 1987; Rosati et al., 1991; Wang et al., 1998;  Tonk \n\nand Masselink, 2005), optical devices (Downing et al., 1981; Taborda et al., 1999; Aagaard et al., \n\n2002; Tonk and Masselink, 2005) and acoustic sensors (Vincent and Green, 1990; Vincent et al., \n\n1991). In the present work, longshore sediment transport was studied using two different but \n\ncomplementary approaches. The first one, targeted the understanding of short-term processes \n\nand was based on a tracer experiment, relating the longshore drift rate with the hydrodynamic \n\nconditions. The experiment was designed to study headland sediment bypassing (HSB) and \n\nselective sediment transport processes. The second one was addressed to macroscale processes \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n92 \n\nand aimed at understanding longshore transport patterns along the studied coastal stretch. This \n\nlatter approach was supported by the evaluation of net longshore drift by an empirical \n\nformulation and using an extended wave time-series. \n\n  SHORT-TERM APPROACH \n\nThe tracer experiment was carried out at Grande beach, located 3.5 km north of the Roca cape \n\n(Figure 5.1). As shown in Chapter 3, Grande beach extends for about 1 km with a NNE-SSW \n\norientation, has high exposure to the NW dominant waves and presents a low-degree of \n\nembayment (within the range values of the studied beaches). This beach displays a clockwise \n\nrotation during summer and a counter-clockwise rotation in the winter. The cross-shore \n\nmorphology varies between convex shape due to the presence of a well-developed berm, in the \n\nsummer, and concave shape due to the berm obliteration, in the winter. In the northern sector \n\nthe mean beach face slope and maximum berm crest elevation observed were 4? and 3.5 m, \n\nreceptively; while in the southern sector, were 6? and 4.4 m, respectively. Beach sediment is \n\nmainly composed by coarse sand that tends to gets finer seaward (see Chapter 4). \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1. Grande beach: (A) geographic location; (B) north and (C) south views of the beach on June 11th \n2014. \n\nA B \n\nC \n\n\n\nLongshore Sediment Transport \n\n \n\n93 \n\n Methods \n\n Tracer approach \n\nThe use of tracers to estimate longshore drift can be done through spatial integration method \n\n(SIM), time integration method (TIM) and continuous injection method (CIM) (Ingle and \n\nGorsline, 1973; Madsen, 1987). In the present work, the CIM (also known as dilution method) \n\nwas applied, injecting a known quantity of tracer at a given position, at a constant rate, over a \n\ngiven sufficient time to allow stabilization of the tracer flux rate downdrift, measured at one or \n\nmore locations. The application of the principle of tracer mass conservation, assuming that a \n\nsteady state can be reached, yields that the rate which the tracer is introduced into the transport \n\nsystem equals the rate that tracer leaves the transport system. Thus, longshore sediment \n\ntransport (?) can be given by: \n\n ? =\n?\n\n?????\n (5.1) \n\nwhere ???  is the steady state or equilibrium concentration measured at a point downdrift of the \n\ninjection site and ? is the volumetric tracer injection rate, which can be deduced from the tracer \n\ndry mass injection rate (??? ) using the equation: \n\n ? =\n???\n\n(1 ? ?)??\n (5.2) \n\nwhere ??  is the quartz density and ? the sand porosity (assumed as 0.4). \n\nCIM was selected due to the advantages point out by Duane and James (1980), namely: (1) tracer \n\nsampling can be accomplished at relatively few fixed locations and there is no need to monitor \n\nthe entire spatial extent of the dispersing tracer cloud, thus minimizing attendant logistic \n\ndifficulties and sampling problems associated with increasing dilution of tracer concentration \n\nwith time; (2) problems associated with increasing dilution of tracer are not a factor because, \n\ntheoretically, in steady state conditions, tracer concentration will increase throughout the \n\nexperiment, until it reaches equilibrium; (3) it is not necessary to determine thickness of the \n\nactive layer nor the width of the transport system, because demonstration of lateral constancy \n\non the equilibrium concentration, across the transport system, is sufficient to validate the \n\nexperimental results. The experimental results validation can be done by establishing sampling \n\nlocations transverse to the transport zone, at several distances from the injection point.  \n\nIf these experiments are performed during relatively short periods of time, the risk of wave \n\nchanging conditions is reduced comparatively with TIM and SIM. Furthermore, it does not \n\nrequires a vertical sampling (sediment cores), because it is not necessary to sample the entire \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n94 \n\nmixing layer. A superficial layer sample with approximately 1 cm is sufficient. In fact, sampling \n\nshould not exceed mixing depth to avoid sampling sediment below the active layer that may \n\nlead to an underestimation of the tracer concentration. \n\n Preparation of fluorescent tracer \n\nThe preparation of the tracer experience was carried out in conjunction with the tracer \n\nexperiment of the Beach to Canyon project4, in order to take advantage of the necessary \n\nlogistics, which otherwise would be very heavy. For this reason the sediment used in the tracer \n\nexperiment of Grande beach was non-native, being collected at Norte beach, located north of \n\nthe study site (at Nazar\u00e9). Norte beach sediment is characterized by a wide grain-size range, with \n\na median grain-size ranging from fine gravel (-2.6 ?) to medium sand (1.79 ?) (Cascalho et al., \n\n2012), ideal to support the study of selective transport processes. On the other hand, it also \n\ninclude the grain-size range of Grande beach sediment (see Chapter 4). \n\nFrom approximately 12 tons of sediment collected at Norte beach, 1.7 tons were used in the \n\ntracer experiment of Grande beach. The sediment tagging process included sediment washing, \n\ndryness and painting. For better adhesion of the ink on the grains surface the sediment was \n\nwashed with running freshwater, inside of permeable big bags, until the salt particles were \n\ncompletely removed. The washed sediment was dispersed on the ground at a storehouse to dry, \n\nbefore being painted with a mixture of orange fluorescent ink and cellulose diluent. The ink and \n\ndiluent quantities were estimated based on tests performed by Silva (2005) that suggests the \n\nuse of a mixture composed by 40 % of ink and 60 % of diluent, and then, a 1:30 proportion of \n\ndiluted ink and sediment. Painting was performed for sediment portions of 100 to 130 kg, using \n\na concrete mixer in motion to minimize sediment aggregation during the drying process. Finally, \n\nthe tracer was stored in portions of about 16 kg inside polyethylene bags (Figure 5.2). \n\n                                                           \n\n4 Beach to Canyon project website: http://beachtocanyon.fc.ul.pt/ \n\nhttp://beachtocanyon.fc.ul.pt/\n\n\nLongshore Sediment Transport \n\n \n\n95 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.2. (A) Sediment collection at Norte beach; (B) drying of the washed sediment; (C) preparation of the \ndiluted fluorescent ink; (B) painting process in a concrete mixer; and (G) storage of the fluorescent tracer. \n\n Fieldwork and data acquisition \n\nThe tracer experiment was scheduled for the end of summer season, considering that the \n\nmaximum beach rotation occurs during the summer, due to the persistent NW low-energy wave \n\nconditions (Chapter 3), which are favourable to the HSB. Few days before the field campaign, \n\nwave forecasting indicated a change in wave direction that was not favourable to the southward \n\nsediment transport. However, taking into account the scheduling and logistics constraints \n\ninherent in fieldwork it was not possible to postpone the experiment until favourable HSB \n\nconditions so, experiment was carried out on September 8th of 2014. \n\nA northward longshore drift current was confirmed in the experiment day with floating devices \n\n(oranges) tossed into the breaker zone. Thus, injection point and sampling sites were defined \n\naccording to these conditions, as shown in Figure 5.3. \n\nA B \n\nC D \n\nE \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n96 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3. Location of the tracer injection point; oceanographic sensors; sediment sampling and mixing depth \n(rods and ditches) monitoring sites; and beach topographic surveys (background image: orthophotomap \nacquired on June 2012, provided by Direc\u00e7\u00e3o-Geral do Territ\u00f3rio - DGT). \n\nMorphological changes were monitored on three cross-shore beach profiles with a GPS-RTK, \n\nduring low tide levels before and after the tracer experiment. Although it was not necessary for \n\nthe tracer dilution method, the thickness of the active layer was measured during the low tide \n\nsubsequent to the tracer experiment, based on sediment thickness deposited above the washers \n\n\n\nLongshore Sediment Transport \n\n \n\n97 \n\non the rods. However, only 6 rods (on the low-tide terrace) remained from the initial 13, thus \n\nthickness of the mixing layer in the beach face was obtained from the tracer vertical \n\ndisplacement observed at 6 ditches opened along a cross-shore profile downdrift the tracer \n\ninjection site (Figure 5.3). \n\nOceanographic conditions (tide, waves and currents) were monitored along a cross-shore \n\nprofile, at approximately 29 m, 43 m and 51 m offshore the tracer injection point (Figure 5.3). \n\nThe first monitoring point included a pressure transductor (PT70), the second one included a \n\npressure transductor (PT72) and an electromagnetic current meter (EMCM), and the third one \n\nincluded an acoustic doppler current profiler (ADP). The acquisition frequency of the PTs and \n\nEMCM was 2 Hz, while for the ADP was 1 Hz. Once these sensors were offshore the breaking \n\nzone during the tracer injection, direction and magnitude of the longshore drift current, were \n\nalso estimated using floating devices (oranges) tossed into the breaker zone. These estimations \n\nwere done at several locations along the sediment sampling stretch. The wave direction was \n\nmonitored using a video camera placed at Calhau do Corvo headland (Figure 5.3). \n\nThe tracer experiment was carried out around the high-tide level, when the surf zone was \n\nnarrower and the waves were plunging at the beach face, avoiding therefore a great dispersion \n\nof the tracer on the low-tide terrace and the rip currents, which are more active during lower \n\ntide levels. Tracer was injected at the inferior limit of the swash zone, at a 16 kg.min-1 rate, during \n\n1 hour and 46 minutes (from 14:09 to 15:55). Superficial sediment samples (?1 cm thickness) \n\nwere collected along 13 downdrift cross-shore profiles spaced by 25 m, from the injection site \n\n(Figure 5.3 and Figure 5.4). Sediment sampling was also performed along one updrift cross-\n\nshore profile, located 25 m from the injection site, to check for any inversion in the longshore \n\ndrift during experiment. Sampling began 10 minutes after the beginning of tracer injection and \n\nextended for about 1 hour and 10 minutes after the injection ended. Sediment sampling cycle \n\nover all profiles lasted about 20 to 30 minutes, but due to the limited number of persons, it was \n\nnot performed synchronously. \n\nEven with the northward longshore drift, two sediment samples southward of injection point \n\nwere collected after the tracer experiment, one at Adraga beach (20:15) and another one at the \n\ntip of Calhau do Corvo headland (20:30). Sediment of the inner sandbar was also sampled at \n\nabout 400 m downdrift of the injection point (21:50). The grain-size analysis of these sediment \n\nwas already presented in Chapter 4, but is presented and discussed in this chapter together with \n\nthe tracer results. \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n98 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.4. Tracer experiment: (A) 106 bags with 16 kg of tracer each one; (B) and (C) tracer injection at the \ninferior limit of swash zone; and (D) sediment sampling. \n\n Data processing and analysis \n\nOceanographic data  \n\nWave parameters (height and period) were computed for 10 minutes interval, from the spectral \n\nanalysis of the pressure transducers records, accounting for pressure attenuation according to \n\nKamphuis (2000). The magnitude of cross-shore and longshore currents measured by the EMCM \n\nwere averaged for each 10 minutes interval, while current data acquired by the ADP were \n\nprocessed for a 30 minutes interval, using SonTek ViewADP software. The wave direction and \n\nwave breaking angle were obtained from the video images, which were corrected and rectified \n\nusing a set of ground control points acquired during the image acquisition, following the work \n\nof Taborda and Silva (2012). \n\nSedimentological data \n\nThe sediment grain-size analysis was performed for a sub-set of the samples collected during \n\nthe experiment (23 from 286 samples), in order to compare the grain-size distribution of the \n\nGrande beach sediment and the tracer sediment. The analysis was performed according to the \n\nmethod described in section 4.2.2.1 of the previous chapter. \n\nTracer data \n\nSediment samples collected for the tracer analysis were washed with freshwater and dried in an \n\noven at 100?C; afterwards each sample was well mixed and spread on black boards, in a way \n\nB A \n\nC D \n\n\n\nLongshore Sediment Transport \n\n \n\n99 \n\nthat the sediment completely covered the board, before being photographed with white and \n\nultraviolet (UV) light using a digital camera (Figure 5.5).  \n\n \n\nFigure 5.5. (A) Spreading of a portions of sediment sample in a black board and (B) image acquisition system. \n\nTracer particles detection and counting were done by image analysis using a MATLAB toolbox \n\n(SedPhoto2 toolbox \u2013 see Appendix B). This toolbox converts, originally acquired RGB images \n\ninto Lab colour space images (Hunter labs, 1996) and, identifies the area occupied by each tracer \n\nparticle through image segmentation (image binarization). The image segmentation process is \n\ndefined based on threshold values for a and b (colour-opponent dimensions) obtained from the \n\nspectral signature of the tracer particles, and based on an adjustment of L (lightness). This \n\nprocedure can be done using the UV light images only; however, as some shells particles \n\nreflected in the same spectral range of tracer particles, white light images were also used to \n\ndifferentiate shells from tracer (under white light, shells display a white colour while tracer \n\ndisplays an orange colour). \n\nBased on the area of tracer particles computed with SedPhoto2, it was possible to perform a \n\ngrain-size analysis, assuming an equivalent diameter. Tracer particles were grouped in 1 ? \n\nclasses and the individual frequency of each class was estimated, allowing the computation of a \n\nmean grain-size of tracer for each sample. \n\nThe tracer concentration, or dilution, was obtained through the ratio between the area occupied \n\nby the tracer particles and the image area. To estimate a longshore drift rates, these relative \n\ndilutions were converted into mass dilutions using a calibration curve. This curve was developed \n\nbased on standard dilutions obtained with controlled masses of the tracer relatively to the \n\nnatural beach sediment. The standard dilution samples were, equally, photographed and \n\nprocessed with the SedPhoto2 toolbox. The relation between the relative area dilutions (??) \n\nand the standard mass dilutions (??), was obtained by a least square linear fitting forcing the \n\nA B \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n100 \n\nregression line to pass though the origin (Figure 5.6). The tracer dilution of each sediment \n\nsample was then computed considering all tracer particles and for each tracer grain-size class. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.6. Relation between standard mass dilution (??) obtained from controlled masses of tracer and \n\nrelative area dilution (?? ) obtained from the image analysis. \n\n Tracer concentration modelling \n\nTracer dilution is a consequence of advection and diffusion processes. Thus, an analytical \n\nsolution of advection-diffusion equation (ADE) was used to model the tracer concentrations \n\nobserved alongshore over the time. According to Socolofsky and Jirka (2005), 1D ADE is given by \n\nexpression: \n\n \n??\n\n??\n+ ??\n\n??\n\n??\n? ?\n\n?2?\n\n??2\n= 0 (5.3) \n\nwhere ? is the concentration, ? is the diffusion coefficient, ?? is the advection velocity,  ? is the \n\ncoordinate in the flow direction and ? is the time. If an initial concentration (?0) is assumed, the \n\nanalytical solution of 1D ADE for an instantaneous concentration at a point is given by: \n\n ?(?, ?) =\n?0\n2\n\n???? [\n? ? ?? ?\n\n?4??\n] (5.4) \n\nwhere ???? is the error function. \n\nTo fit the aforementioned model to the data, an unconstrained nonlinear optimization algorithm \n\n(fminsearch function of MATLAB) was applied to find a ?? and ? local minimums of the scalar \n\nfunction ?(?, ?), starting at an initial estimated which in this case was the steady state \n\nconcentration (?0 = ????? ). \n\nDm = 1.708Dr\nR\u00b2 = 0.989\n\n0.E+00\n\n2.E-03\n\n4.E-03\n\n6.E-03\n\n8.E-03\n\n1.E-02\n\n1.E-02\n\n0.E+00 1.E-03 2.E-03 3.E-03 4.E-03 5.E-03 6.E-03 7.E-03\n\nS\nta\n\nn\nd\n\na\nrd\n\n m\na\n\nss\n d\n\nil\nu\n\nti\no\n\nn\n (\n\nD\nm\n\n)\n\nRelative area dilution (Dr)\n\n\n\nLongshore Sediment Transport \n\n \n\n101 \n\n Longshore sediment transport  \n\nThe longshore drift rate was computed from the equation (5.1), based on the tracer equilibrium \n\nconcentration (????? ), and on the volumetric tracer injection rate (16 kg.min\n-1). The rate obtained \n\nwas compared with the rate estimated by the Bagnold (1963) approach that relates the \n\nimmersed weight sediment transport with the wave energy flux and the longshore drift current. \n\nAccording to the simplifications proposed by Komar (1998) based on the wave linear theory, this \n\napproach can be given by: \n\n ?? = ????\n????\n\n0.5??\n (5.5) \n\nwhere ????  is the mean longshore current velocity; ? = 1 8? ????\n2 is the total wave energy (? is \n\nthe sea water density (1025 kgm-3), ? is the gravitational acceleration (9.81 ms-2) and ?? is the \n\nbreaking wave height); ?? dimensionless empirical coefficient, assumed as 0.28 according to \n\nKomar and Inman (1970), when root mean square wave height at the breaking is used to \n\ncompute the total wave energy. \n\nThe immersed weight transport rates were converted into volumetric sediment transport rates \n\n(?) by the relation ?? = (?? ? ?)(1 ? ?)??, where ??  is the sediment density (quartz density \n\nwas assumed 2650 kgm-3), and ? is the sand porosity (0.4). \n\n Results \n\n Beach morphology  \n\nTopographic profiles show that the beach had a steep beach face (???? = 0.12) with a low-\n\ngradient tide terrace (???? = 0.03) and that the berm width and elevation increased from north \n\nto south. The comparison of the profiles surveyed during low-tide before and after the \n\nexperiment, revealed no significant morphological changes (Figure 5.7 to Figure 5.9). \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n102 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.7.

Under these conditions, the flow was northward. During \n\nthe tracer experiment period, the water column above the sensor was higher (offshore the \n\nbreaking zone), being the flow magnitude lower (&lt;0.1 m.s-1) and southward (Figure 5.15). \n\nThe longshore current velocity measured by EMCM present a similar pattern, despite the slightly \n\nlower maximum magnitudes in the beginning and end of the record (0.54 and 0.42 m.s-1, \n\nrespectively). On the other hand, the cross-shore current measured by EMCM present negative \n\nvalues that, considering the sensor position, indicate a flow towards offshore with magnitudes \n\nranging between 0.003 and 0.12 m.s-1 (Figure 5.15).  \n\nA B \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n106 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.15.

It should be noted that despite the overlapping \n\nrepresentation of the profiles, these were located at distinct positions along the coast. Rod\u2019s \n\nprofile was located close to the tracer injection point, while ditches profile was located 150 m \n\ndowndrift the injection point and corresponded to the beach face domain. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.17. Thickness of the active layer measured on ditches through the tracer vertical mixing and on \nsediment deposition measured on rods. \n\nThe results show that the mixing depth increased from 6 to 11 cm from berm crest to the base \n\nof the beach face, while at the transition zone, between beach face and low-tide terrace (around \n\n50 m from the profile origin), mixing depths were smaller than the ones obtained with rods. \n\nThese differences can be related with measurement inaccuracies due to the presence of water \n\nand to differences of profile morphology, especially when in presence of cusps systems, as can \n\nnoticed by the concave and convex shape of the two profiles. The mixing depth at the low-tide \n\nterrace varied between 8 and 11 cm. \n\n Grain-size of the tracer particles and beach native sediment \n\nGrain-size distributions obtained from laboratorial analysis show that sediment samples \n\ncollected at the beach face and berm of Grande beach had mean grain-sizes between 0.60 ? and \n\n0.9 ? (coarse sand), with standard deviations inferior to 0.38 ? (well to very well sorted). The \n\nsediment used to trace transport, on the other hand, had mean grain-sizes between - 0.06 ? and \n\n0.44 ?

Despite the differences in grain-size distributions of the \n\ntracer and the beach native sediment, tracer grain-size range covers the entire grain-size range \n\nof Grande beach (Figure 5.18).  \n\nThe sediment collected at Calhau do Corvo and Adraga beach presents a grain-size distribution \n\nsimilar to the sediments collected at beach face and berm of Grande beach; although, in the \n\ncase of Adraga, a slight enrichment in medium sand is observed. On the other hand, the \n\nsediment collected at the inner sandbar is clearly finer compare to the beach face and berm of \n\nthe Grande beach. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.18. Grain-size distribution of beach native sediment and tracer samples, obtained from laboratory \nanalysis. \n\nThe grain-size analysis of tracer particles found in sediment samples collected during the tracer \n\nexperiment (computed by image analysis), show three main grain-size modal classes: very \n\ncoarse sand (-1 ? to 0 ?), coarse sand (0 ? to 1 ?) and medium sand (1 ? to 2 ?). The results also \n\nshow the existence of particles smaller than 3 ? that, according to the laboratory grain-size \n\nanalysis of the tracer sediment, had null percentages (Figure 5.19).  \n\n\n\nLongshore Sediment Transport \n\n \n\n109 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.19. Grain-size distributions of tracer particles on the sediment samples obtained from image analysis. \n\nThe spatial analysis of the tracer particles show that mean grain-size decreased with the \n\nlongshore distance to the injection point. In the cross-shore direction, the mean grain-size \n\ndecreasing occurred from the lower to higher elevations, correspondingly from lower beach face \n\nto upper beach face (Figure 5.20). \n\n \n\nFigure 5.20.

Updrift of the injection site \n\n(-25 m), concentrations were null; while downdrift, as expected, tracer concentration decreased \n\nwith the distance. The exception is the medium gravel, which has a small significance and did \n\nnot show any distribution pattern. Up to 50 m downdrift, tracer concentration show large \n\nvariations along the sampling profiles and an abrupt decreasing in a short time after the tracer \n\ninjection ended, mainly for coarser particles. Between 75 and 100 m downdrift, it is possible to \n\nobserve that concentration increased and then then became steadier. This is particularity \n\nevident for the finer particles (medium to very fine sand), which reached the steady state earlier. \n\nIn the case of coarser particles, as well as in the case where all tracer particles were considered, \n\nthe steady state condition is not so evident. For distances greater than 100 m, concentration \n\nincreased slower, mainly for coarse sediments, and steady state was not reached. \n\nThe sediments collected at the inner sandbar, Calhau do Corvo tip and Adraga beach did not \n\nreveal any tracer particle. \n\n\n\nLongshore Sediment Transport \n\n \n\n111 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.21.

Relation between tracer concentration and topographic elevation relative to the mean sea level \n(MSL). \n\n Discussion \n\n Beach morphology and oceanographic conditions \n\nDuring the tracer experiment (September 8th 2014), Grande beach presented a well-developed \n\nberm, a steep beach face and a low-gradient tide terrace (Figure 5.7 to Figure 5.9). Under these \n\nconditions, the tracer experiment had to be carried out during high-tide, when the surf zone was \n\nnarrower and the waves were plunging at the beach face, avoided tracer dispersion on the low-\n\ntide terrace. \n\nThis fact, led that oceanographic sensors staying most of the time offshore the breaking zone, \n\nexplaining the low magnitude of the longshore current during high-tide level. However, at the \n\nbeginning and end of the current records, when the waves were breaking on the sensors, the \n\nmeasured flow was clearly northward and had a magnitude between 0.42 and 0.64 m.s-1 (Figure \n\n5.15). The mean longshore current measured with floaters was higher (0.79 m.s-1), due to the \n\nhigher speeds (2 m.s-1) measured at the end of the experiment that seem too high and should \n\n\n\nLongshore Sediment Transport \n\n \n\n113 \n\nbe an effect of sea breeze (Figure 5.16). Thus, in the following sections an average value of \n\n0.62 m.s- 1, estimated from the previous three values, was considered. \n\nThe incident waves were coming from W and NW directions and were characterized by an \n\naverage ?? of 0.7 m and average ?? of 6 s. The northward longshore current indicate that the \n\nflow was dominated by the waves coming from W. However, the interpretation of the incident \n\nwave angles at the breaking seem difficult, considering the variations alongshore due to the \n\ntopo-bathymetric spatial variability and wave interference (Figure 5.13 and Figure 5.14). \n\n Tracer dilution modelling and longshore drift \n\nTracer concentration distributions presented in Figure 5.21 show a great variation along \n\nsampling profiles located at 25 and 50 m downdrift the injection point, as well as an abrupt \n\ndecay of concentration after the end of the injection, mainly for the coarser particles. This \n\nsuggest that at these distances tracer was not completely mixed within the active beach \n\ntransport system. Between 75 and 100 m away from the injection point, steady state \n\nconcentration of finer particles (?1?) is clearly observed. For coarser particles this state is not \n\nso evident, meaning that the tracer injection should have been extended in time either by using \n\nmore tracer or through a lower injection rate. Tide level variation during the tracer experiment \n\n(approx. 1.20 m) is also a factor that does not match steady state condition. \n\nNevertheless, the application of the advection-diffusion model to simulate tracer dilution \n\nrevealed, in general, a reasonable fit to data, supporting the equilibrium concentration \n\nidentified from the tracer dilutions. Model results for overall tracer particles and for very coarse, \n\ncoarse, medium and fine sand particles are presented in Figure 5.23 to Figure 5.27, for distances \n\nbetween 75 and 150 m. The results for the remaining distances can be seen in the Appendix C.  \n\nDue to the deficient mixture of coarser particles at 25 and 50 m from the injection point, the \n\ntracer dilution of the coarse and very coarse sand, as well as the ones obtained considering all \n\ntracer particles, at these distances, were not use in the nonlinear optimization to find advection \n\nvelocity and diffusion coefficient. \n\nMedium gravel was excluded from the analysis due to the inexistence of a coherent dilution \n\npattern; as well as fine gravel, because the results gave an advection velocity almost null and a \n\ndiffusion coefficient one order of magnitude higher than the ones found for the other grain-\n\nsizes, which appears to be unrealistic and deserves further investigation. These results can be \n\nexplained by the lower frequency of these particles in the tracer sediment (averaging 4 %) and \n\ntheir lower transport rates.  \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n114 \n\nVery fine sand was also excluded because the laboratory grain-size analysis of tracer sediment \n\nindicate absence of these particles (Figure 5.18). The low percentages of very fine sand obtained \n\nfrom image analysis, should be an effect of particles overlapping, which is more problematic in \n\nthe case of finer particles, because they tend to fall into spaces between the larger particles. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.23.

The results show that sediment diffusion and advection velocity \n\nincrease from the coarser to the finer particles. The average advection velocity and transport \n\nrates of the grain-size classes present similar values to those obtained based on overall tracer \n\nparticle. This means that the velocity and volume of the sediment transport alongshore depend \n\nupon the relative amount of particles of each grain-size class within the entire distribution, \n\nwhich is in agreement with the observations performed by Komar (1977). On the other hand, \n\nthis also means that grain-size classes with lower frequencies have little significance in the \n\nsediment transport rate. Thus, taking in account that Grande beach native sediment is \n\nessentially composed by very coarse, coarse and medium sand, a transport rate of \n\n8.15\u00d710- 2  m3.s-1 was estimated based on the average rate of these three grain-size classes \n\n(Table 5.2).  \n\nTable 5.1.

Therefore, the mean \n\nadvection velocity estimated based on the three main grain-sizes classes of Grande beach was \n\nmultiplied by the transport cross-sectional area, deduced by the thickness of the active layer \n\nmeasured along the beach profile and the width of the zone under the influence of breaking \n\nwaves (see Figure 5.17 and Table 5.2). \n\nThe estimated longshore transport rate was 7.99\u00d710-2 m3.s-1, a magnitude similar to the \n\npreviously estimated. However, the width of the transport section considered (beach face + low-\n\ntide terrace) is wider compared to the narrow breaking zone, during the tracer experiment \n\n(beach face). This suggests that the longshore transport under spilling breakers (at the low-tide \n\nterrace) is lower than under plunging beakers (at the beach face), which can be explained by a \n\nsmaller mixing depth induced by this breaking type. In the study case, mixing depth at the low-\n\ntide terrace may even be overestimated due to the water in the mixing layer that difficult the \n\nmeasurement through the washers sinking. \n\nThe longshore drift estimated using tracer data were also compared with the rate computed \n\nusing Bagnold\u2019s (1963) approach (Table 5.2). The rate obtained was 1.44\u00d710-2 m3.s-1, which is \n\n5.5 times lower than the rates measured from the tracer experiment. This means that the \n\ndimensionless empirical coefficients (??) proposed Komar and Inman (1970) is not adequate to \n\nestimate the sediment transport under plunging breakers, in this case, the ?? obtained was 1.5. \n\nIn fact, previous works carried out on the Portuguese reflective beaches reported that the \n\nlongshore transport formulas tend to underestimate the total transport rate when applied to \n\nsteep beaches under plunging breakers and that the differences between the two methods are \n\nusually one order of magnitude (Ciavola et al., 1997; Taborda et al., 1994; Silva et al., 2007).  \n\nThe ration between advection velocity and average longshore drift current was 0.028, similar to \n\nthe ratios obtained in previous authors (0.021-0.024 in Ciavola et al., 1997; 0.017 in Taborda et \n\nal., 1994 and 0.010 in Silva et al., 2007), supporting the hypothesis that the high transport rates \n\n\n\nLongshore Sediment Transport \n\n \n\n119 \n\nare mostly linked with high cross-sectional area of the transport system, due to the high mixing \n\ndepth observed in steep beaches under plunging breakers. \n\n Selective sediment transport \n\nThe grain-size analysis of the tracer particles show that coarser particles tend to concentrate at \n\nthe lower beach face, while the finer ones are transported up to the upper beach face (Figure \n\n5.20B and Figure 5.22), suggesting a transport of the coarser particles towards offshore. \n\nHowever, the finer sediment found at the inner sandbar indicate that coarser particles are \n\ntrapped at the base of the beach face. This observation is in agreement with previous works, \n\nwhich have been shown that sediment grain-size is generally coarser within the wave plunge \n\npoint at the base of the beach face, decreasing both up to the foreshore slope and towards \n\noffshore, sometime with a second sediment coarsening at the offshore bar (see the synthesis \n\nabout this subject in Komar, 1998). \n\nThis sediment sorting can explain the absence of tracer in the sediment collected 400 m \n\ndowndrift of the injection point at the inner sandbar, considering that sediment use to tracer \n\nhad high percentages of coarse particles (&lt;1 ?). \n\nThe longshore variations, on the other hand, show a decrease of the tracer mean grain-size with \n\ndistance to the injection point, which can be explained by the fact that finer particles remain \n\nlonger in suspension and thus travel farther in a shorter time.  \n\nThe longshore transport rates estimated from the equilibrium concentrations increase from the \n\nvery coarse to medium sand. In fact, several works have recognised the sediment grain-size \n\neffect on the magnitude of sediment transport, showing that an increase in the median \n\ngrain- size will decrease longshore transport rates (e.g. del Valle et al., 1993; King, 2005). \n\nKomar (1977) observed an opposite behaviour in a tracer experiment carried out on a steep \n\nbeach face (? = 8?) under plunging breakers (?? = 0.42 m; ? = 3.4 s; ?? = 27?), where the \n\nadvection velocity decreased from the very coarse to medium sand with larger differences \n\n(between 3.1\u00d7102 and 0.6\u00d7102 m.s-1). The same author justifies that the finer grains swash high \n\nup the beach face, where they move alongshore more slowly than the coarser grains, which \n\nremain near the breaker zone and are transported by stronger longshore currents. However, his \n\nanalysis was based on five sediment samples collected alongshore at the same elevation level, \n\nwhich limits the data interpretation and comparison. Still, even that finer particles remain longer \n\nat the same position, once entrained by waves, they can be transported, in suspension, for \n\nlonger distances. \n\n \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n120 \n\n Headland sediment bypassing \n\nDespite the northward longshore drift observed, Grande beach presented a morphology that \n\nwas favourable to the HSB southward, i.e. a wider southern sector and a continuous inner \n\nsandbar along the Calhau do Corvo headland coast (Figure 5.28). \n\nThis morphology should result from the previous incident wave condition that induced the \n\nbeach clockwise rotation and HSB through the low-tide terrace, which is compatible with the \n\nenrichment of medium sand observed at Adraga beach and at the inner sandbar, compare to \n\nthe berm and beach face sediment of Grande beach. \n\nAs the HSB occurs at the low-tide terrace under spilling breakers, its magnitude should be lower \n\nthan the longshore drift estimated from the tracer experiment under plunging breakers. Even \n\nso, a significant sediment volume can bypass the headland during a tide cycle, under low-energy \n\nwave conditions, considering the advection velocity of the tracer and the mixing depth observed \n\nat the low-tide terrace. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.28.

(2010) that was presented \n\nin Figure 1.7 of Chapter 1. \n\nThe offshore waves were propagated up to 15 m depth using the SWAN (Simulating Waves \n\nNearshore) model, which is a spectral third-generation wave model developed by Delft \n\nUniversity of Technology (Booij et al., 1999). The SWAN model was implemented using a \n\nbathymetry built based on three data sources: (1) European Marine Observation and Data \n\nNetwork (EMODnet) with a 428 m resolution, available online at: http://www.emodnet-\n\nhydrography.eu/; (2) Instituto Hidrogr\u00e1fico with 250 m resolution, available online at: \n\nhttp://www.hidrografico.pt/download-gratuito.php; and (3) the LiDAR data provided by \n\nDire\u00e7\u00e3o-Geral do Territ\u00f3rio with 2 m resolution. The model computational domain was \n\ndiscretized by a rectangular grid with 89\u00d7189 km dimension and 500 m resolution. The \n\nboundary conditions were imposed by the mentioned 56-years wave time-series of integral \n\nparameters (wave significant height, peak period and peak direction) with a time interval of 6 \n\nhours. The spectra shape was Jonswap, with a spectral directional resolution of 10\u00b0, while the \n\ndiscretization in the frequency-space was made using 31 intervals between 0.04 to 1 Hz. No \n\ncurrents, wind or tidal levels were used, therefore, nonlinear quadruplet wave interactions were \n\ndisabled and a mean sea water level was considered. The model output parameters were \n\nsignificant wave height (??), mean absolute wave period (??01) and mean wave direction \n\n(???). \n\nFor the period under analysis there is no wave data near to the coast to validate the model \n\nresults. However, the validation results presented by Ribeiro (2013), for the SWAN model \n\nperformance at the Portuguese west coast, showed a root mean square of 0.42 m for ?? and 9? \n\nfor ???, consistent with the errors presented in other works for the Portuguese west coast (e.g. \n\nRusu et al., 2008; Silva et al., 2009). This validation was performed with the data of an ADCP \n\nmoored at 28 m depth north of Peniche. \n\nFrom 15 m depth to the breaking point, waves were propagated based on the wave linear theory \n\nand on the Snell law, using the Larson et al. (2010) approach to estimate breaking wave \n\nparameters. \n\nhttp://www.emodnet-hydrography.eu/\nhttp://www.emodnet-hydrography.eu/\nhttp://www.hidrografico.pt/download-gratuito.php\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n122 \n\nThe longshore drift induced by each wave was computed with the CERC formula proposed by \n\nRosati et al. (2002), which relates longshore component of the energy flux at the breaking and \n\nthe longshore sediment transport through the equation: \n\n ? = ? (\n???\n\n16??\n1\n2(?? ? ?)(1 ? ?)\n\n) ??\n?\n\n5\n2sin (2?? ) (5.6) \n\nwhere ??  is the wave breaking criteria (0.78); ? is the sea water density (1025 kgm\n-3); ??  is the \n\nquartz density (2650 kgm-3); ? is the gravitational acceleration (9.81 ms-2); ? is the assumed sand \n\nporosity (0.4); ??? is the wave significant height at breaking; ?? is the wave breaker angle, and \n\n? is an empirical coefficient (0.39, according to CERC, 1984). \n\nThe longshore drift estimated corresponds to a potential value that should not correspond to \n\nthe effective longshore drift considering the sediment starving observed in the studied coast. \n\nUnder these circumstances, the use of the ? parameter estimated from the tracer experiment \n\nwould not improve the results. However, the goal of this approach was to get insights on the net \n\nlongshore drift patterns, which are independent of the transport magnitude.  \n\n Results \n\n Breaking wave conditions \n\nThe results show that breaking waves have a mean ?? between 1.5 and 2.3 m and a time-\n\naveraged power between 11 and 27 k.Wm-1. For both parameters, the lowest values occur in \n\nthe stretches sheltered by Carvoeiro and Roca headlands, as well as in the vicinity of Foz do \n\nLizandro where an inflection in the coastline orientation is observed. In these stretches the ratio \n\nbetween nearshore and offshore wave power show a large wave power reduction. In the other \n\nstretches, ?? and wave power are higher and the ratio between nearshore and offshore wave \n\npower indicate a small wave power reduction, mainly in the vicinity of Lamporeira headland. \n\nMean ??? and mean wave power direction are, in general, orthogonal to the coastline due to \n\nwave refraction (Figure 5.29). \n\n\n\nLongshore Sediment Transport \n\n \n\n123 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.29. (A) Mean wave significant height and direction at the breaking; (B) mean wave power and power \ndirection at the breaking; and (C) ratio between nearshore (??) and offshore (?0) wave power. The mean wave \ndirection and mean wave power direction are represented by the arrows orientation. \n\n Potential net longshore drift \n\nThe annual potential net drift is shown Figure 5.30; negative values correspond to a southward \n\ntransport, while positive values correspond to a northward transport. The potential transport \n\nhave lower magnitudes in the sectors NE-SW oriented, while the sectors NW-SE and N-S oriented \n\npresent a higher potential transport. The sediment transport is preferably southward, however, \n\nin some circumscribed areas potential net drift is northward. The most notable cases are the \n\nstretches immediately north of the Consola\u00e7\u00e3o, Lampoeira, Roca and Raso headlands, where \n\nnorthward component show higher magnitudes and frequencies.  \n\nThe analysis of seasonal potential net drift show that the higher transport magnitudes occur \n\nduring autumn (October-December) and winter (January \u2013 March) seasons. The asymmetry in \n\nthe transport magnitude between sectors with different orientation, is higher during \n\nautumn/winter when compared to spring/summer seasons. Further, it can be noticed that at \n\nNW-SE stretches, the northward transport component is particularly significant during \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n124 \n\nautumn/winter seasons. In the spring, the northward component weakens, and in the summer, \n\nrarely can counterweight the southward component (Figure 5.31). \n\n \n\nFigure 5.30.

Seasonal potential net drift: (A) Autumn; (B) Winter; (C) Spring; and (D) Summer (negative values \ncorrespond to the south-directed transport, while positive values are the north-directed transport). \n\n \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n126 \n\n Discussion \n\nThe magnitude of the potential net drift estimated, reach 2\u00d7107 m3.yr-1 at Lamporeira headland, \n\none order of magnitude higher than the one estimated by Silva et al. (2012a),  for a NE-SW \n\noriented coastal stretch located north of the studied site (Mondego cape \u2013 Nazar\u00e9 headland). \n\nHowever, the sediment starving observed in the studied coast indicate that the effective net \n\ndrift is significantly lower than the potential net drift. Moreover, as the goal of this analysis was \n\nto understand the transport patterns, is the relative alongshore variation that is relevant, a \n\npattern that is independent of the absolute transport values. \n\nIt should be noted that the potential net drift estimated in the vicinity of the Peniche peninsula \n\nis not consistent, considering the 500 m grid resolution used for the wave propagation \n\nmodelling, which cannot properly represent the complex bottom morphology of this area. Thus, \n\nthe wave refraction in this region should be greater and the potential net drift southward smaller \n\nthan the estimated.  \n\nThe annual net drift put in evidence the role of Carvoeiro, Consola\u00e7\u00e3o, Lamporeira, Roca and \n\nRaso headlands as major boundaries in the transport pattern. In the N-S and NW-SE oriented \n\nstretches, south of these headlands, net transport is higher and permanently southward; while \n\nin the NE-SW oriented stretches, north of these headlands, the southward component weakens \n\nand is counterweighed by the northward one that reduces the net dominant drift. In some \n\nplaces, the aforementioned process can revert the direction of the net longshore drift (i.e. \n\nnorthward). The northward transport component reach its higher magnitudes in the vicinity of \n\nthe headlands, weakening northward. The seasonal analysis shows that this pattern is induced \n\nby the high-energy autumn/winter waves. In the spring, on the other hand, due to the decline \n\nand clockwise rotation of wave energy, transport magnitudes decrease and the northward \n\ncomponent of transport weakens, being overcame by the southward component in summer \n\nalong almost the entire coast. \n\nThe persistence of the southward longshore drift in summer, can led to a sand accumulation at \n\nthe updrift (north) side of the headlands, as shown in Chapter 3, and sand bypass can occur. On \n\nthe other hand, in the autumn/winter the opposite direction of the net drift in the both side of \n\nthe headlands, inhibits the sand bypassing. This analysis confirms that nearshore sediment \n\nbypassing of the aforementioned headlands can only occur southwards, during summer low-\n\nenergy wave conditions. \n\nThese longshore drift patterns justify the sandy and rocky nature of the inner continental shelf \n\nshowed in Chapter 2. In the stretches N-S and NW-SE stretches the sediment is sweep southward \n\n\n\nLongshore Sediment Transport \n\n \n\n127 \n\nby the high longshore transport rates, while in the NE-SW sectors the balance between south \n\nand north transport components, generates a sediment recirculation within these sectors, \n\nallowing sand to accumulate. \n\n CONCLUSIONS \n\nThe results presented in this chapter gave important insights on HSB processes. The presence of \n\na continuous inner sandbar that crossed the tip of the Calhau do Corvo, suggests that HSB occurs \n\nat the low-tide terrace under spilling breakers, having a magnitude lower than longshore drift \n\nmeasured on the beach face, under plunging breakers. Notwithstanding, tracer advection \n\nvelocity and the mixing depth measured at the low-tide terrace, suggest that a significant HSB \n\ncan occur during one tide cycle, under low-energy wave conditions. \n\nThe sediment sorting observed during the tracer experiment showed that coarser particles are \n\ntrapped in the base of the beach face, while the finer ones are transported up to the upper \n\nbeach face or, towards offshore, considering the finer sediment found in the low-tide terrace. \n\nThus, the slightly enrichment of medium sand observed from the Grande beach to Adraga beach, \n\nis compatible with a selective HSB through the low-tide terrace. These results are in line with \n\nthe results presented in the Chapter 4. \n\nThe longshore transport patterns obtained from the potential net longshore drift suggest that \n\nstudied coast can be segmented into four sediment circulation sub-cells: the northern one \n\ncorresponds to the 3 km long beach-bay located between the Peniche peninsula and Consola\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nheadland, while the other three are the macro scale embayments between Consola\u00e7\u00e3o, \n\nLamporeira, Roca and Raso headlands. The opposite direction of the net longshore drift in the \n\nvicinity of the aforementioned headlands indicate that these boundaries only can be crossed in \n\na single direction (southward), corresponding to gated boundaries. This behaviour can be \n\nexplained considering that the net drift in the southern stretches is permanently southward \n\ndirected, so all the sediment that bypass these headland cannot reverse its path. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n128 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n129 \n\n  \n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing and \nShoreline Evolution \n\n INTRODUCTION \n\nHeadland sediment bypassing (HSB) is a key process in the headland-bay beaches development \n\nand evolution and, in this context, shoreline evolution modelling can be a useful tool. Several \n\nanalytic and numerical models have been proposed to describe changes in shoreline based on \n\nanalysis of the balance of sediment volumes over a certain time period, assuming an equilibrium \n\nbeach profile (e.g. Pelnard-Consid\u00e8re, 1956; Hanson, 1989; Dabees and Kamphuis, 1998; \n\nSteetzel et al., 2000; Coelho et al., 2004). These models are based on the assumption that the \n\nbeach profile shape remains constant; the shoreward and seaward vertical limits of the profile \n\nare constant and there is an adequate sand supply, i.e. an infinite supply of sand is assumed \n\n(Thomas and Ashley, 2013). However, in headland-bay coasts as the study one, the equilibrium \n\nprofile assumption up to the closure depth is not valid due to the sediment scarcity and to the \n\npresence of cliffs and rocky shore platforms.  \n\nIn this chapter a new shoreline evolution model \u2013 SEM-PLAT, developed to simulate shoreline \n\nchanges on coastal stretches where beaches develop over a rocky platform, is presented and \n\napplied to understand the role of the HSB in the beaches development and evolution. \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n130 \n\nSEM-PLAT model was applied to study, in particular, the HSB occurring in subaerial beach \n\ndomain. This model was firstly applied to the stretch between Ma\u00e7\u00e3s and Adraga (Taborda and \n\nRibeiro, 2016), being now extended northwards up to Magoito beach (Figure 6.1). In the \n\nnorthern sector of this coastal stretch, beaches are a thin layer of sand that covers a rocky shore \n\nplatform. The wide sand accumulation found in the north edge, results from the shelter \n\npromoted by the Magoito headland to the NW dominant waves; southward, narrow beaches \n\nare found at Aguda and Azenhas do Mar. In the southern sector, are the Ma\u00e7\u00e3s and Adraga \n\nbeaches, which usually present a well-developed berm and are located in fluvial stream mouths. \n\nBetween the theses beaches, occur the Pequena and Grande beaches, the first one is usually \n\nnarrow, while the second one present large variations, changing between a winter concave \n\nmorphology and a summer well-developed berm. \n\n \n\nFigure 6.1.

The model is based on the standard \n\nconservation of sand volume equation that governs most shoreline evolution models: \n\n  \n??\n\n??\n+\n\n??\n\n??\n= 0 (6.1) \n\nwhere ?  is the distance alongshore, ?  is the time, ?  is the longshore sediment transport rate \n\nand ? is the volume of the active profile. This equation shows that profile change rate (?? ??? ) \n\nis directly related to the alongshore gradients in longshore drift (?? ??? ).  \n\nIn finite difference form, the conservation of sediment mass for each coastal section can be \n\nexpressed as: \n\n  ?? =\n(?\n\n??\n? ?\n\n???\n)??\n\n??\n (6.2) \n\nwhere ???  is the sediment that enters in a coastal section and ????  is the volume leaving the \n\ncoastal section (Figure 6.2).  \n\n \n\nFigure 6.2. Definition of standard conservation of sediment volume for shoreline change calculation in a \ncontrol section. \n\nThe equation (6.2) can be solved numerically, using finite difference methods over a discretized \n\ncoastline domain knowing the longshore drift and boundary conditions. In the case of SEM-PLAT, \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n132 \n\nan explicit method is used. In order to establish the convergence of the finite-difference \n\napproximation, the model uses an adaptative time step, i.e. the minimum time step between \n\nthe value defined by the user and the value computed based on the courant condition \n\n(??????? ?????? = ???/??). By default the Courant number adopted by the model is 0.5. \n\nThe model setting include the definition of the computational grid, profile model, offshore \n\nwaves and boundary conditions. For each time step, a new shoreline is computed according to \n\nthe flowchart presented in Figure 6.3. \n\n \n\nFigure 6.3. SEM-PLAT model flowchart.  \n\n Computational grid \n\nThe computational grid is built from an initial shoreline, a coastline and a baseline (Figure 6.4). \n\nThe shoreline (??, ?? ) corresponds to the beach berm crest and the coastline (?? , ?? ) to the cliff \n\nor dune foot. The baseline (?? , ?? ) is a reference line that can be curved and represents the \n\ntrend of the shoreline, similar to the one proposed by Roelvink and Reniers (2012).  The main \n\nadvantage of using a curved baseline is related to the possibility of modelling non-straight \n\ncoastal stretches, as is generally the case of headland-bay coasts. The grid consists of ? cells \n\ndefined by ? + 1 cell boundaries, with uniform or variable alongshore resolution. SEM-PLAT is \n\nbased on a staggered grid where the shoreline positions (?? ) are defined at the center of the grid \n\ncells and, the longshore drift (?? ) and the azimuth of the normal to the shoreline (??) are \n\ndefined at the cell boundaries. The left boundary is located at grid cell 1, and the right boundary \n\nis at cell ?.  \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing and Shoreline Evolution \n\n \n\n133 \n\n \n\nFigure 6.4. Finite difference staggered grid, where (?? , ?? ) are the shoreline coordinates, (?? , ?? ) are the \ncoastline coordinates, (?? , ??) are the baseline coordinates, ??  is th the distance between the baseline and \nshoreline (normal to the baseline), ?? is the longshore drift at cells boundaries and ??  is the azimuth of the \nnormal to the shoreline. \n\n Profile model \n\nSEM-PLAT profile model assumes a two dimensional profile cut in a hard rock substrate over \n\nwhich a sandy beach develops. The model is similar to the one proposed by Taborda and Ribeiro, \n\n(2015) where the beach overlays a flat, gently-sloping, shore platform. Beach profile is \n\nsegmented in three domains: (1) a berm, (2) a beach face, and (3) a nearshore zone (Figure 6.5). \n\nThe berm and beach face have constant slopes and the nearshore zone is based on the Dean\u2019s \n\nequilibrium profile (see for example Dean et al., 2002), considering that at the origin of the \n\nDean's profile, the slope is equal to the beach face slope. The theoretical profile extends up to a \n\nspecified closure depth, however, the beach domain ends where the theoretical profile \n\nintercepts the shore platform. The model assumes that the rocky shore platform has a constant \n\nslope. \n\n \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n134 \n\n \n\nFigure 6.5. Schematic representation of the beach profile (yellow) and rocky platform (gray). Black dots \n\nrepresent the positions of the coastline (??, ?? ); shoreline (?? , ?? ); beachface foot (???? , ???? ); beach end \n\n(???, ??? ); and shore platform origin/landward limit (???0, ???0). ??  is the berm slope; ??? is the beachface \n\nslope; ??? is the shore platform slope. \n\n Boundary conditions \n\nSEM-PLAT allow two options for the boundary conditions: closed and open. If an open boundary \n\ncondition is chosen, sediment is transported freely across the boundary (default boundary \n\ncondition). When a closed boundary condition is specified, means no sediment is transported \n\nacross the boundary. The sediment transport across the left and right boundaries are computed \n\naccording to the flowing conditions: \n\n? If left boundary is open ?  ?(1) = ?(2); \n\n? If left boundary is closed ? ?(1) = 0; \n\n? If right boundary is open ? ?(????? + 1) = ?(?????) \n\n? If the right boundary is closed ? ?(????? + 1) = 0 \n\n Wave transformation \n\nWave transformation is based on the wave linear theory and Snell\u2019s law. Wave propagation from \n\noffshore to the closure depth (or other depth computed from a numerical wave propagation \n\nmodel) is computed considering a regional bathymetry, with an orientation that does not change \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing and Shoreline Evolution \n\n \n\n135 \n\nin time.  From the defined depth to the breaking depth the transformation is performed \n\nconsidering (time varying) normal direction to the shoreline between adjacent cells (Figure 6.4). \n\nThe propagation in this domain follows the explicit approach present in Larson et al. (2010) \n\ntargeting to optimize the computation time. \n\n Potential longshore drift \n\nThe potential longshore sediment transport induced by the waves is computed using the CERC \n\nformula proposed by Rosati et al. (2002), represented by the equation (5.6), in the section 5.3.1 \n\nof the previous chapter. \n\n Effective longshore drift \n\nIn headland-bay coasts the effective longshore drift is generally much lower than potential \n\ntransport, because the magnitude of sediment distribution processes (potential longshore drift) \n\nis in general much larger than the sediment supply. The consideration of a sediment starving \n\ncoast is a cornerstone of the SEM-PLAT model development. SEM-PLAT first computes longshore \n\nsediment transport rates along the coastal stretch assuming that there is no sediment deficit \n\n(potential longshore drift). Then, considering sediment availability, which depends not only on \n\nthe sediment in cell but also on the updrift ones, it estimates effective longshore drift. To identify \n\nupdrift cells, SEM-PLAT computes a sediment accumulation vector which is a cumulative count \n\nof the number of cells that naturally drains into each cell (analogous to the flow accumulation \n\ntool used in hydrology). After this, the model, sweeps the cells, from updrift to downdrift \n\nadjusting the longshore transport magnitude to the available sediment, according to the \n\nfollowing conditions (Figure 6.6): \n\n(1) If the ?? computed is positive or negative and smaller than the initial volume of the cell, \n\nthe effective transport at the cell boundary is equal to the potential transport.    \n\n(2) If the ?? computed is negative and greater than the initial volume of the cell, the \n\nlongshore transport magnitude at the cell boundaries must be adjust. In this case: \n\n?  if sediment leaves the cell through one boundary, the effective transport is the \n\nsum of the initial volume of the cell and the volume that enters in the cell; \n\n? if the sediment output occur through both cell boundaries, the effective \n\ntransport at each boundary is 50% of the initial volume of the cell. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n136 \n\nCell number \n\nC\nlo\n\nse\nd\n\n b\no\n\nu\nn\n\nd\na\n\nry\n \n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 \n\nO\np\n\ne\nn\n\n b\no\n\nu\nn\n\nd\na\n\nry\n \n\nQ direction ? ? ?? ? ? ? ?? ? ? ? ? \n\nCell \naccumulation \n\n0 1 6 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 \n\nInitial volume  70 60 40 40 50 50 100 70 90 60 20 \n\nNew volume  10 60 160 40 50 40 0 60 90 60 20 \n\nFigure 6.6. Scheme of the update volume at each cell based on the effective longshore drift, considering a \nhypotetical potential longshore drift of 60 at each cell boundary and that left model boundary is closed and \nrigth model boundary is open. \n\n Beach profiles update and shoreline position \n\nFor each time step, the sediment retained in each cell is redistributed within the beach profile \n\naccording the following rules: \n\n(1) if the ?? is positive ? beach accrete and the sediment volume is added to the berm; \n\n(2) if the ?? is negative ? beach erode and the sediment volume is subtracted: \n\n? if ????? + ?? >  0 ? berm retreat; \n\n? ????? + ?? &lt; 0 and ?????? + ?? >  0 ? berm obliteration and profile retreat \n\nfrom beach face; \n\n? if ?????? + ?? ?  0 ? complete obliteration of the beach profile. \n\nThe shoreline position depends on the berm width, so when the berm is completely obliterated \n\nthe shoreline evolution ceases although the beach profile can still change. \n\n MODEL SETTING \n\nModel computational domain was extended from northern sector of Magoito beach to the mid \n\nof Adraga beach and discretized in 79 cells with approximately 100 m length (Figure 6.7). The \n\ncoastline was defined as the base of the cliff for most of the domain, except at small stretches \n\nwere the dune foot (Ma\u00e7\u00e3s beach) or artificial structure foot (Grande beach) were considered. \n\nAs the goal was the study of HSB occurring in the subaerial beach, the model was set to account \n\nthe effective longshore drift occurring between the coastline and the elevation of \u2013 1 m (MSL) \n\nthat corresponds to the rocky shore platform elevation observed in the Magoito beach (see \n\nChapter 3). The beach face slope (0.09) and berm crest elevation (4 m) were also chosen based \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing and Shoreline Evolution \n\n \n\n137 \n\non mean values of the observed beach profiles. Berm and shore platform were considered \n\nhorizontal (Figure 6.8).  \n\n \n\nFigure 6.7.

The northern boundary was set closed and the southern one open, allowing \n\nsediment leave the system until it reach the equilibrium. The simulation S2 (summer) starts from \n\nthe shoreline position obtained from the simulation S1 and the boundary conditions were \n\nmaintained; while the simulation S3 (winter) starts from shoreline position obtained from the \n\nsimulation S2 and both boundaries were set closed to avoid that an unrealistic quantity of \n\nsediment get in the system through the southern boundary. The simulation S1 was conducted \n\nfor a time-period of two years considering the large sediment volume in the system, while the \n\nother two correspond to a time-period of one year. \n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nCross-shore distance (m)\n\nE\nle\n\nv\na\nti\no\nn\n r\n\ne\nla\n\nti\nv\ne\n t\n\no\n t\n\nh\ne\n M\n\nS\nL\n (\n\nm\n)\n\n \n\n \n\nbeach\n\nrocky platform\n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing and Shoreline Evolution \n\n \n\n139 \n\n MODEL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nThe model results for annual time-averaged wave conditions show a sand redistribution pattern \n\nin the southern sector close to the one observed in the Figure 6.1.

The model was able \n\nto reproduce the narrow beaches at Aguda and Azenhas do Mar, that mainly correspond to an \n\nintertidal domain, but in the case of Magoito, model do not match entirely with the \n\nobservations, as the beach was reduce to a narrow face without berm (Figure 6.10). As shown \n\nin the Figure 6.1 and by the results of Magoito beach morphology presented in Chapter 3, \n\nbeaches in this sector are characterized by a thin sand deposit covering the rocky shore platform \n\nthat is often exposed.

This configuration with a larger berm in the southern sector of Grande \n\nbeach and, the retreat at the northern sector and at Pequena beach, are compatible with beach \n\nplanform rotation observed during the summer months (in Chapter 3). \n\n4.57 4.58 4.59 4.6 4.61 4.62 4.63\n\nx 10\n5\n\n4.295\n\n4.296\n\n4.297\n\n4.298\n\n4.299\n\n4.3\n\n4.301\n\n4.302\nx 10\n\n6\n\nx coordinate (m)\n\ny\n c\n\no\no\nrd\n\nin\na\nte\n\n (\nm\n\n)\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n66\n67\n68\n69\n70\n71\n72\n73\n74\n75\n76\n77\n78\n79\n\nWinter time-averaged conditions\n\n \n\n \n\nshoreline\n\ncoastline\n\nbaseline\n\ncell boundary\n\ncell mid point\n\nnormal to the baseline\n\nbeach face &amp; low-tide terrace\n\nberm\n\nAdraga \n\nGrande \n\nPequena \n\nMa\u00e7\u00e3s \n\nAzenhas do Mar \n\nAguda \n\nMagoito \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing and Shoreline Evolution \n\n \n\n143 \n\n \n\nFigure 6.13.

The tide level at the time of the image acquisition was computed based on Cascais tide gauge data \nusing the UTIDE model (Codiga, 2011). \n\nThe model results for typical winter wave, show a berm retreat, mainly at Grande Beach, in \n\nagreement with the observed in the satellite image obtained in the winter of 2015 (Figure \n\n6.13B). The retreat of the southern sector of the Grande beach occurs in relation with the \n\nenlargement of its northern sector and the adjacent Pequena beach, which is in agreement with \n\nsummer and winter Pequena beach profiles presented in Chapter 3 (Figure 3.24). The beach \n\nenlargement is mainly related with the intertidal zone (face and terrace) and can be also \n\nobserved at Ma\u00e7\u00e3s beach. In the case of Adraga, the model cannot reproduce the expected \n\ncount clockwise rotation because the southern boundary was defined on this beach. Despite the \n\nnorthward longshore drift, the northern stretch present a sand distribution pattern similar to \n\nthe one obtained for summer wave condition, corroborating the assumption that HSB north-\n\ndirected is more difficulty (Figure 6.12 and Figure 6.10). \n\nA B \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n144 \n\nThese results are in agreement with beach planform rotation presented in Chapter 3 and with \n\ntransport patterns obtained in Chapter 5, i.e. during summer low-energy wave conditions, the \n\nnet sediment transport is southward, inducing a beach clockwise rotation; while during winter \n\nhigh-energy wave conditions, the net sediment transport is northward, inducing a counter \n\nclockwise beach rotation.   \n\n CONCLUSIONS  \n\nSEM-PLAT model results are quite encouraging and suggest that it can be a useful tool to \n\nunderstand some key processes in headland-bay coasts such as HSB and beach rotation. \n\nThe model results reproduced quite well the beach characteristics along the southern coastal \n\nstretch, putting in evidence sand redistribution as a major mechanism of beach development, \n\nwhere the HSB occurring in the subaerial beach seems to plays an important role. \n\nThe poorest model results for the northern coastal stretch should be an effect of the local \n\nbathymetric changes related with the exposed shore platform (whose configuration was greatly \n\nsimplified in the model) that constrain nearshore wave propagation. Moreover, the differences \n\nbetween model results and the observations can be also justified by the use of stationary wave \n\nconditions, which obviously is a simplification of the wave forcing.  \n\nThe planform beach rotation induced by the summer and winter time-averaged waves, indicate \n\nthat seasonal (and interannual) changes in the incident wave climate can significantly affect the \n\nbeach configuration or even its development, putting in evidence the delicate dynamic \n\nequilibrium of these beaches. This also means that the wave climate rotation (in relation to \n\nclimate changes) can have strong impacts on evolution of these beaches.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n145 \n\n  \n\nSediment Budget \n\n INTRODUCTION \n\nHeadland sediment bypassing (HSB) plays a major role in the definition of coastal sediment \n\nbudget, particularly, on headland-bay coasts, as is the case of the coast between Carvoeiro and \n\nRaso capes. However, sediment budget of a littoral cell depends not only on the longshore \n\nsediment transport, but also on other sediment sources and sinks as schematized in Figure 7.1. \n\nThe coastal stretch between Carvoeiro and Raso capes has been considered as a single littoral \n\ncell of sediment circulation, assuming a negligible wave-driven HSB at north and south \n\nboundaries (Santos et al., 2014), which is supported by the geomorphological and \n\nsedimentological analysis presented in the Chapter 2 and by the distinct heavy mineral \n\nsignatures found by Balsinha et al. (2010), in the fluvial streams and beaches located north and \n\nsouth of Carvoeiro cape. \n\nThe sediment sources and sinks of the studied coast, found in literature, are summarized in \n\nFigure 7.2 and described below.  \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n146 \n\n \n\nFigure 7.1. Schematic representation of the sedimentary sources and sinks of a littoral cell (adapted from van \nRijn, 2010). \n\nThe main sediment sources are the fluvial streams and the coastal erosion; the latter one should \n\nbe mainly from cliffs, considering that these represent 81 % of the coastline (Marques et al., \n\n2013). \n\nThe work presented by Lira et al. (2013), showed that the S\u00e3o Domingos, Alcabrichel, Sizandro \n\nand Lizandro rivers provide 37\u00d7103 m3.yr-1 of sediment, but only 10 to 40%  (i.e. 3.7\u00d7103 to \n\n14.8\u00d7103 m3.yr-1) of this sediment is compatible with the beach sediment. The sedimentary \n\ncontribution of the smaller fluvial streams could not be discretised from the referred work, since \n\nthat they were grouped with other small fluvial systems that do not drain to the study area.  \n\nAndrade et al. (2009), Oliviera (2009) and Taborda et al. (2010), estimated both fluvial and cliff \n\nerosion contribution for the Sintra and Cascais coasts and, according to their results, sediment \n\nsupply for the littoral downdrift of Foz do Lizandro does not exceed 6\u00d7103 m3.yr-1. \n\nThe sediment supply from fluvial streams can be reduce due to dam\u2019s construction, as is the \n\ncase of S\u00e3o Domingos river. The study presented by Janardo (2016), showed that S\u00e3o Domingos \n\ndam\u2019s reservoir is a very efficient trap for sand, interrupting its transport downstream. According \n\n\n\n Sediment Budget \n\n \n\n147 \n\nto this author, before the dam\u2019s construction (started in 1988, as reported at: http://www.cm-\n\npeniche.pt/, accessed Mar. 2017), sediment supply for the littoral was between 1.2\u00d7103 and \n\n2.7\u00d7103 m3.yr-1. Currently, sediment supply should be much lower, considering that 87 % of the \n\nsediment yield is capture by the dam.  \n\n \n\nFigure 7.2. Main sediment sources and sinks of the studied coast based on previous works (values in \n\u00d7103  m3.yr-1).  \n\nThe sediment exchange of beach-dune systems, promoted by aeolian transport, is also a \n\npossible sediment source and sink as shown in Figure 7.1. However, beach-dune systems occupy \n\nhttp://www.cm-peniche.pt/CustomPages/ShowPage.aspx?pageid=894520a6-65d0-4e01-abc7-b0be6900a6e7\nhttp://www.cm-peniche.pt/CustomPages/ShowPage.aspx?pageid=894520a6-65d0-4e01-abc7-b0be6900a6e7\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n148 \n\nonly 6 % of the studied coast (Marques et al., 2013), occurring near to stream mouths and \n\npresenting, in most of the cases, poor-developed dune fields. \n\nThe larger dune fields are the Consola\u00e7\u00e3o and Guincho-Cresmina, located near the northern and \n\nsouthern limits of the studied coast, respectively. The first one is relatively stabilized by \n\nvegetation, while the second one, it is an active and extremely unstable system due to the \n\nconstant drifting of sand particles. According to Reb\u00ealo et al. (2002), the Guincho-Cresmina \n\ndunes belong to a vaster and complex dune system, known as the Guincho-Oitavos and classified \n\nas a headland bypass dune field. Guincho-Cesmina dunes should therefore considered a major  \n\nsediment sink, while the sediment exchanges by aeolian transport of the other dune fields \n\nshould have a small significance in the sediment budget of the studied coast. The aeolian \n\ntransport at Guincho-Cresmina dune was estimated by Reb\u00ealo et al. (2002), based on \n\ntopographic data acquired between 2000 and 2001, with a magnitude of 14\u00d7103 m3.yr-1. For the \n\nsame dune system and based on topographic maps and aerial images, Santos (2006) estimated \n\nan aeolian transport of 28\u00d7103 m3.yr-1, between 1974 and 1981, and 18\u00d7103 m3.yr-1, for the \n\nperiods 1981-1990 and 1974-1990.    \n\nAt the northern boundary of the studied coast, aeolian sand transport is a possible sediment \n\nsource, considering the proximity of the Baleal beach-dune system, located at the north side of \n\nthe Peniche isthmus. However, currently, this should be reduced due to the urban structures on \n\nthe isthmus. \n\nThe cross-shore exchange between littoral and the continental shelf should be reduce and \n\nrelated with extreme storm events, but no reference about this subject was found for the \n\nstudied area.  Also, there are no morphological evidence of submarine canyons on the studied \n\ninner shelf (Vanney and Mogenout, 1981; Badagola, 2008); therefore, there is no significant \n\nsediment losses for deeper continental shelf.  \n\nThe sediment retention related with the sea-level rise (SLR), is also a sediment loss that is not \n\nquantified for the study coast. \n\nAccording to the harbours dredging plan presented by LNEC (2010), Peniche and Ericeira \n\nharbours should capture, 30\u00d7103 m3.yr-1 and 2\u00d7103 m3.yr-1 of sediment, respectively, mainly \n\ncomposed by sand. More recently, Andrade et al. (2015) presented a value of 7\u00d7103 m3.yr-1 for \n\nthe Ericeira harbour, based on information provided by DGRM (Direc\u00e7\u00e3o-Geral de Recursos \n\nNaturais, Seguran\u00e7a e Servi\u00e7os Mar\u00edtimos). LNEC (2010) refer that only two maintenance \n\ndredging operations at Peniche harbour were carried out in the period 2000-2010, \n\ncorresponding to a sediment volume of 6.6\u00d7103 m3, dredged in 2004. In the case of Ericeira \n\n\n\n Sediment Budget \n\n \n\n149 \n\nharbour, one dredging was performed in 2003, but its volume is unknown. Despite the \n\nrecommendations presented in this report for the use of the uncontaminated sediment dredged \n\nfrom the harbours in the beach nourishment, there is no information about the operations \n\ncarried out in the Peniche harbour after 2010. In the case of Ericeira harbour, about 9\u00d7103 m3 \n\nof sand were dredged in the last two years, which were used to nourish the Algodio beach \n\nlocated north of the harbour (personal communication of the Dr. Fernando Magalh\u00e3es of the \n\nAg\u00eancia Portuguesa do Ambiente). Based on this volumes the sediment capture of this harbour \n\ncan be estimated in 4.5\u00d7103 m3.yr-1. \n\nThe coastline evolution presented by Lira et al. (2016), based on foredune toe location observed \n\nfrom aerial images (1958-2010), suggest a non-significant long-term evolution for the coastal \n\nstretch between Carvoeiro and Raso capes, compared to other sectors of the Portuguese \n\nwestern coast. The signal and magnitude of the changes are site-specific and the main trends \n\nobserved were erosion at Consola\u00e7\u00e3o, north sector of Foz do Sizandro and Guincho (-0.49, -0.22 \n\nand -0.65 ?0.2 m.yr-1), and accretion at Areia Branca, Santa Rita and south sector of Foz do \n\nSizandro (+0.74, +1.06 and +0.23 ?0.2 m.yr-1, respectively). The other dune fields had changes \n\nthat are within the method uncertainty (?0.2 m.yr-1). The authors concluded that the measured \n\nchanges essentially reflect the coastal system\u2019s natural variability, assuming that anthropogenic \n\ninfluence in sediment supply are negligible. \n\nThe work presented by Carapu\u00e7o (2016)5, based on historical postcards dated from the early \n\n20th century to the present, suggests that the western beaches of Cascais (i.e. Abano, Guincho \n\nand Cresmina beaches, located north of Raso cape) are relatively stable. This author assumes \n\nthat shoreline changes are related with seasonal to interannual variations in oceanographic \n\nforcing, excluding a perceptible long-term trend. Furthermore, the photo-monitoring carried out \n\nby the same author at the same beaches, during approximately one year, illustrate well the \n\nseasonal changes occurring in these beaches. \n\nAccording to the longshore sediment transport patterns presented in Chapter 5, this coast can \n\nbe segment into four sub-cells: (1) Carvoeiro-Consola\u00e7\u00e3o; (2) Consola\u00e7\u00e3o-Lamporeira; (3) \n\nLamporeira-Roca; and (4) Roca-Raso. The main goal of this chapter is to define a comprehensive \n\nsediment budget for the studied coast and respective sub-cells, based on the main sediment \n\nsources and sinks identified (Figure 7.2) and, on the information obtained from previous \n\nchapters. \n\n                                                           \n\n5 See also the website: http://beachphotomonitoring.campus.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/  \n\nhttp://beachphotomonitoring.campus.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n150 \n\nAs existing information about the main sediment sources is spatially limited (i.e. is not available \n\nor discretize along the entire coast) and because estimates were obtained through different \n\nmethods, new estimates are presented in this chapter. Moreover, the sediment loss related with \n\nthe SLR and the long-term evolution of the studied beaches were also investigated. \n\n METHODS \n\n Estimation of sediment volume from cliff erosion \n\nThe estimation of sediment volumes resulting from cliffs erosion was based on a historical \n\ninventory of cliff instabilities carried out by Penacho et al. (2013). This inventory was based on \n\nthe comparison of aerial photographs covering the period between 1942-47 and 2010. The \n\nvolume displaced (?) from each retreat movement detected was computed based on the mean \n\ncliff height (??), mean retreat of the cliff crest (???) and length of the affected cliff (?) available in \n\nthe inventory, using the following expression: \n\n ? = ?? \u00d7 ? (7.1) \n\nwhere ??  is the affected cross-sectional area of cliff, assuming that cliffs have vertical faces and \n\nlandslide as a triangular area: ?? = (?? \u00d7 ???) 2? . According to Professor Fernando Marques of the \n\nUniversity of Lisbon (personal communication) this approach can underestimate the volumes \n\nwhen landslides have cross-sectional areas with trapezoidal shapes or when cliffs present less \n\nsteep faces, and overestimated volumes when landslide does not affect the entire cliff height. \n\nNonetheless, the same author noted that most of the cliffs of the study area have very steep \n\nfaces, therefore this approach can be considered acceptable. Sediment yield rates from cliff \n\nerosion were then computed by dividing the estimated volume by monitoring time period of \n\neach landslide event. \n\n Estimation of sediment yield from watersheds \n\nSediment yield from watersheds was estimated based on the soil erosion potential. Watersheds \n\nlimits were defined based on the ASTER GEDM 2 digital elevation map (?30 m resolution), \n\nrelease in 2011 by Japan\u2019s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry \u2013 METI and U.S. National \n\nAeronautics and Space Administration \u2013 NASA (available online at: \n\nhttps://gdex.cr.usgs.gov/gdex/, accessed Feb. 2013), using the Hydrology toolbox of ArcGIS \n\nsoftware. \n\nhttps://gdex.cr.usgs.gov/gdex/\n\n\n Sediment Budget \n\n \n\n151 \n\nThe soil erosion was estimated using an empirical model - Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation \n\n(RUSLE) model (Renard et al., 1997), which is a revision and update of the widely used Universal \n\nSoil Loss Equation (USLE) model (Wischmeier and Smith, 1978). According to the RUSLE model, \n\npotential soil erosion is computed through the equation: \n\n ? = ? \u00d7 ? \u00d7 ? \u00d7 ? \u00d7 ? \u00d7 ? (7.2) \n\nwhere ? is the average soil loss (mass/area/year), ? is the rainfall-runoff erosivity factor, ? is \n\nthe soil erodibility factor, ? is the slope length factor, ? is the slope steepness factor, ? is the \n\ncover-management factor, and ? is the support practices factor. \n\nFor the present case study, the rainfall-runoff erosivity factor ? was extracted from the rainfall-\n\nrunoff erosivity map of the Atlas da \u00c1gua, for precipitation episodes that have exceeded \n\n25.4  mm (available online at: http://sniamb.apambiente.pt/, accessed Oct. 2015). \n\nThe soil erodibility factor ? was obtained from Soil Map of Atlas do Ambiente, which follows the \n\nFood and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) classification system (available \n\nonline at: http://sniamb.apambiente.pt/, accessed Oct. 2015). The relation of the factor \n\n? values with the FAO classification follow the systematization proposed in Pimenta (1998) for \n\nthe Portuguese territory. \n\nThe cover-management factor ? was obtained from the CORINE Land Cover 2006 map (Caetano \n\net al., 2009) (available online at: http://www.dgterritorio.pt, accessed Oct. 2015). The relations \n\nbetween ? values and the CORINE land cover level 1 classes follow the systematization proposed \n\nby Tom\u00e1s and Coutinho (1993) for the Portuguese territory. \n\nTo make the RUSLE model suitable at the catchment scale, ? and ? factors were merged into a \n\nsingle topographic factor (??) following the equation proposed by Mitasova et al. (1996, 2001), \n\nfor computation of the factor at a point ? on a hillslope: \n\n ??? = (? + 1) (\n??\n\n22.13\n)\n\n?\n\n(\nsin??\n\n0.0896\n)\n\n?\n\n (7.3) \n\nwhere ??  is upslope contributing area per unit contour width (???? ???????????? \u00d7 ???? ????), \n\n??  is the slope, and ? and ? are parameters for a specific prevailing type of flow and soil \n\nconditions. The variables ??  and ??  were computed based on digital terrain map used to limiting \n\nthe watersheds areas (i.e. ASTER GEDM 2 with ?30 m resolution), while ? and ? were assumed \n\nequal to 0.4 and 1.3, respectively, following the work presented by Lira et al. (2013) for an area \n\nthat includes the studied watersheds. \n\nhttp://sniamb.apambiente.pt/\nhttp://sniamb.apambiente.pt/\nhttp://www.dgterritorio.pt/\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n152 \n\nFinally, the ? factor was considered equal to 1 due to lack of information and impossibility of \n\nspatial discrimination (Cardoso, 1985; Lira et al., 2013). \n\nThe transformation of soil erosion potential into sediment yield potential can be achieved by a \n\nmultiplicative coefficient, known as Sedimentary Delivery Ratio (SDR). According to Cardoso \n\n(1985), when there are no objective measurements to determine a SDR coefficient, an empirical \n\ncorrelation between watershed area (??) and the SDR values proposed by Mitchell and \n\nBuzenzer (1980, in Cardoso, 1985) can be used. The correlation is given by the equation: \n\n ??? = ?0.052 ln(?? ) + 0.374 (7.4) \n\nThe sediment yield obtained in units of weight per year, were then converted into volumes, \n\nassuming a sediment dry unit weight. According to the relation between dry unit weight and the \n\npercentage of sand in the sediment accumulated in dam\u2019s reservoirs, proposed by Lane and \n\nKoelzen (1943, in Sousa, 1995), and considering sand percentages obtained by Oliveira (2009) \n\nand Janardo (2016) for the sediment resulting from watersheds erosion, the dry unit weight \n\nshould be between 11 and 15 kN.m-3, so a mean value of 13 kN.m-3 was assumed. \n\nData integration and computation of sediment yield was made with the ArcGIS software, using \n\nthe toolbox created by Lira et al. (2013) for this purpose.  \n\n Estimation of littoral sediment supply \n\nLittoral sediment supply corresponds to the sediment volume provided by the sediment sources \n\nthat is compatible with beach systems. Considering the sandy nature of the studied beaches, \n\nsediment yield from watersheds and cliff erosion, useful for the littoral, should correspond \n\napproximately to the sand percentage in the total sediment yield. Thus, the quantification of the \n\nlittoral sediment supply was based on grain-size compatibility factors between the sediment \n\nresulting from the erosion of the lithotypes that outcrop in the watersheds/cliffs and the beach \n\nsediment. \n\nThe analysis of each lithotype to get grain-size compatibility factor is a heavy task and time \n\nconsuming. Since it is not the scope of this work, the compatibility factors were chosen based \n\non information found in the works of Oliveira (2009), for the Sintra\u2019s watersheds, and Janardo \n\n(2016), for the S\u00e3o Domingos\u2019 watershed (Peniche) (Table 7.1). \n\nAccording to the analysis presented by the authors mentioned above, the sand percentages of \n\nJurassic and Cretaceous formations are quite variable due to the facies variation on limestones, \n\nmarlstones and sandstones layers. Thus, sediment supply from these geological formations was \n\nestimated considering a range of values, between the minimum compatibility factor found for \n\n\n\n Sediment Budget \n\n \n\n153 \n\nthe Jurassic-Cretaceous formations and the mean compatibility factor found for Jurassic \n\nsuperior formations, since these correspond to 70 % of the total area occupied by both Jurassic \n\nand Cretaceous formations. \n\nTable 7.1. Grain-size compatibility factors presented by Oliveira (2009) and Janardo (2016), and the ones \nassumed in this work. \n\nGeological formations* \n\nGrain-size compatibility factor \n\nOliviera (2009) Janardo (2016) This work \n\nJurassic and Cretaceous \nsedimentary formations \n\n0.10 (Jurassic) and \n0.15 (Cretaceous) \n\n0.15 to 0.60 (Jurassic) 0.10 to 0.35 \n\nEocene-Oligocene sedimentary \nformations \n\n0.35 - 0.35 \n\nPleistocene and Pliocene \nsedimentary formations \n\n- 0.75 0.75 \n\nHolocene sedimentary \nformations \n\n0.60 0.76 0.76 \n\nGranitic rocks 0.85 - 0.85 \n\nVolcanic rocks - - 0.25 \n\n* see lithological description in section 1.5.1 \n\nThe works mentioned above did not analysed the grain-size compatibility of volcanic sub-\n\nvolcanic rocks that also outcrop in the studied watersheds, as shown by the geological map \n\npresented in Chapter 1 (see Figure 1.6). Basalts are the dominant lithotype and, according to \n\nanalysis performed by Fedo et al. (2015), they can produce detrital material with 50 % of sand. \n\nHowever, this analysis was based on crushed basalt samples and did not account the strong \n\nchemical weathering affecting these rocks; thus, the sand percentage resulting from volcanic \n\nand sub-volcanic rocks should be lower, being assumed a compatibility factor of 0.25.  \n\nThe littoral sediment supply was computed by multiplying the volume of total sediment yield \n\nand the grain-size compatibility factor. In the cliff case, this is a direct relation since each mass \n\nmovements affected only one of the geological formations defined in the Table 7.1. In the case \n\nof watersheds, the estimated volumes were adjust by a mean compatibility factor (??): \n\n ?? =  \n? ??\n\n?\n1 . ???\n\n??\n (7.5) \n\nwhere ??  is the grain-size compatibility of each lithotype, ???  is the outcrop area of each \n\nlithotype (based on the Geological Map of Portugal at a 1:500 000 scale, presented in Figure \n\n1.6);  ?? is the watershed area; ? is the number of lithotypes. \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n154 \n\n Estimation of sediment retention related with the sea-level rise \n\nThe sediment retention related with the SLR was estimated assuming some of the assumptions \n\nof the model proposed by Taborda and Ribeiro (2015) to estimate the impact of the SLR in \n\nplatform beaches, which considers that headland-bay beaches are usually limited to the upper \n\nsection of the profile and beach face is limited by a rocky shore platform. This model develops \n\non the assumption that the beach profile (including berm elevation and face slope) is in \n\nequilibrium with mean sea-level (MSL) and wave climate. In response to sea- level rise, the \n\nmodel assumes that the profile will preserve the shape but the berm will be raised by the same \n\namount as the rise in sea-level. If the system is assumed closed (i.e. beach volume is invariant) \n\nthe thickness of sediment deposited over the berm must be compensated by the erosion of the \n\nbeach face and landward migration of the berm crest. \n\nHowever, considering the results presented in previous chapters, the studied beaches are not \n\nclosed systems and the sediment deposited over the berm must be compensated by the HSB. \n\nUnder these conditions, the sediment volume retained by the berm rising can be estimated \n\nmultiplying the beach berm area and SLR. The estimation was performed considering the SLR \n\nrate of 2.5 mm.yr-1, estimated by Antunes and Taborda (2009) for first decade of the 21st century. \n\nThe berm area of each beach was computed from the beach length (presented in the Chapter \n\n3) and average beach width. The average beach width was estimated based on the distance \n\nbetween the berm crest line (S line, see section 3.2.2.1) and the coastline (i.e. dune, cliff or \n\nstructure toe), using the Digital Shoreline Analysis v4.3 software (Thieler et al., 2009). \n\n Historic and recent ground-photographs analysis \n\nHistoric and recent ground-photographs were used to get insights on long-term beach evolution, \n\nthrough a simple comparison. Most of the historic images were extracted from the antique \n\npostcards website Delcampe (https://www.delcampe.net/), but also from the blogs Not\u00edcias de \n\nColares (http://freguesiacolares.blogspot.pt/) and Rio das Ma\u00e7\u00e3s \n\n(http://riodasmacas.blogspot.pt/). The images date is unknown in most of the cases, but the \n\npostmarks, on the back of the postcards, helped to constrain a minimum date. The recent \n\nphotographs were acquired during the field work or kindly provided by colleagues. These images \n\nhad as first intent the photo-monitoring of the studied beaches, therefore, camera location and \n\ndirection angle are not exactly the same of the historic images. The image comparison was \n\nperformed only for few beaches once it is very difficult to find historical photographs for the \n\nmost of them. The beaches were Sta. Cruz, Baleia (Ericeira), Magoito, Ma\u00e7\u00e3s, Grande and Adraga \n\n(see location in Figure 7.2). \n\nhttps://www.delcampe.net/en_US/collectibles/search?search_mode=all&amp;excluded_terms=&amp;is_searchable_in_descriptions=0&amp;is_searchable_in_translations=0&amp;term=praia+das+ma%C3%A7%C3%A3s+sintra&amp;show_type=all&amp;display_ongoing=ongoing&amp;started_days=&amp;started_hours=&amp;ended_hours=&amp;display_only=ongoing&amp;min_price=&amp;max_price=&amp;currency=all&amp;seller_localisation=&amp;view=gallery&amp;order=\nhttp://freguesiacolares.blogspot.pt/2006/09/praia-grande-passado-e-presente.html\nhttp://riodasmacas.blogspot.pt/2015/05/sobre-praia-da-adraga.html\n\n\n Sediment Budget \n\n \n\n155 \n\n RESULTS  \n\n Sediment volume from cliff erosion \n\nThe spatial distribution of the landslides identified by Penacho et al. (2013) shows that this are \n\nmore frequent in the stretch between Consola\u00e7\u00e3o and Ericeira (60 %), but its magnitude is quite \n\nvariable alongshore (Figure 7.3A). The sediment volume magnitude varies between 6.5 and \n\n1.8\u00d7105 m3, but only 22 % exceed 1\u00d7103 m3 (Figure 7.3B). For the period under analysis \n\n(1942- 2010), cliff erosion provided a total of 6.8\u00d7105 m3 of detrital material, which correspond \n\nto a sediment yield of 1.4\u00d7104 m3.yr-1. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 7.3.

On \n\nthe whole, fluvial streams release 7\u00d7104 m3.yr-1 of sediment. Lizandro and Sizandro rivers are \n\nthe main sources, with 14\u00d7103 and 12\u00d7103 m3.yr-1, respectively; followed by Alcabrichel \n\n(7\u00d7103  m3.yr-1), Grande (6\u00d7103 m3.yr-1), Safarujo (6\u00d7103 m3.yr-1), Cuco (5\u00d7103 m3.yr-1), Colares \n\n(4\u00d7103 m3.yr-1) and S\u00e3o Domingos (3\u00d7103 m3.yr-1).

The changes observed on the beaches can \n\nbe explained by the seasonal and interannual wave variability, as shown by the beach \n\nmorphological analysis and photo-monitoring (see Chapter 3). These observations are in \n\nagreement with coastline evolution of the short low-lying sandy stretches presented by Lira et \n\nal. (2016) and with the study of Carapu\u00e7o (2016) in the western beaches of Cascais. \n\nhttps://www.delcampe.net/en_US/collectibles/search?search_mode=all&amp;excluded_terms=&amp;is_searchable_in_descriptions=0&amp;is_searchable_in_translations=0&amp;term=praia+das+ma%C3%A7%C3%A3s+sintra&amp;show_type=all&amp;display_ongoing=ongoing&amp;started_days=&amp;started_hours=&amp;ended_hours=&amp;display_only=ongoing&amp;min_price=&amp;max_price=&amp;currency=all&amp;seller_localisation=&amp;view=gallery&amp;order=\nhttp://freguesiacolares.blogspot.pt/2006/09/praia-grande-passado-e-presente.html\nhttp://riodasmacas.blogspot.pt/2015/05/sobre-praia-da-adraga.html\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n160 \n\nThe sediment retention related with the SLR was estimated in 4.7\u00d7103 m3.yr-1 (for a berm area \n\nof 1.9\u00d7106 m2), one order of magnitude lower than the main sediment sources (1.6\u00d7104 to \n\n3.3\u00d7104 m3.yr-1). This added retention does not have significant impacts on the shoreline \n\nposition, corroborating the assumption that HSB is the main driver of beach dynamics and \n\nevolution. However, considering the expected sea-level change scenarios in relation to climate \n\nchange, is plausible that this sediment sink will have a greater impact on the sediment budget \n\nof this coast. \n\nThe longshore sediment transport patterns presented in Chapter 5, showed that the studied \n\ncoast is segment into four sub-cells: (1) Carvoeiro-Consola\u00e7\u00e3o; (2) Consola\u00e7\u00e3o-Lamporeira; (3) \n\nLamporeira-Roca; and (4) Roca-Raso. The transport patterns also showed that the headlands \n\nthat separate this sub-cell are gated boundaries, where the net HSB only occurs in the southward \n\ndirection. \n\nThe sediment supply provided by fluvial streams and cliff erosion and, the sediment retention \n\nrelated with the SLR of each sub-cell, are presented in Figure 7.8. It can be noticed that sub-cell \n\n3 receives between 9\u00d7103 and 1.7\u00d7104 m3.yr-1 of sediment (more than half of the sediment \n\nsupply estimated for the entire coast), followed by sub-cell 2 with a sediment supply of 5.3\u00d7103 \n\nto 1.3\u00d7104 m3.yr-1; while in the sub-cells 1 and 4, sediment supply do not exceed 2\u00d7103 m3.yr-1. \n\nDespite the larger source area of the sub-cell 1, sediment supply for the sub-cell 4 is higher, \n\nwhich should be the effect of the geology and geomorphology.  \n\n \n\nFigure 7.8. Sediment supply (from fluvial streams and cliff erosion) and sediment loss related with the SLR, \nfor each sub-cell: (1) Carvoeiro-Consola\u00e7\u00e3o; (2) Consola\u00e7\u00e3o-Lamporeira, (3) Lamporeira-Roca and (4) Roca-\nRaso.

It should also be noticed that sediment supply for the sub-cell 1 is provided \n\nalmost in totality by fluvial stream and corresponds to the reference condition, taking into \n\naccount the current sediment retention in S\u00e3o Domingos dam\u2019s reservoir. \n\nThe sediment loss related with the SLR have higher magnitudes in the sub-cell 2 \n\n(2.6\u00d7103  m3.yr- 1) and sub-cell 3 (1.4\u00d7103 m3.yr-1) due to longer beach extensions (see Chapter \n\n3); while sub-cells 1 and 3 have sediment losses that do not exceed 500 m3.yr-1 (Figure 7.8). \n\nBased on the magnitude of the sediment sources and sink here presented and the ones obtained \n\nfrom previous studies, as well as on the information obtained in the previous chapters, a \n\nsediment budget for the studied littoral and its sub-cells is proposed (Figure 7.9): \n\nSUB-CELL 1 (CARVOEIRO - CONSOLA\u00c7\u00c3O) \n\nConsidering that: (1) the Carvoeiro cape is a closed boundary, (2) the sediment bypass \n\nnorthward at Consola\u00e7\u00e3o cannot occur, and (3) most of the sediment provided from S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos river is retained in the dam\u2019s reservoir, sediment supply for this cell is negligible. \n\nSediment sinks of this sub-cell are the Peniche harbour with a magnitude of 3\u00d7104 m3.yr-1 \n\n(LNEC, 2010) and the SLR that is two orders of magnitude lower (447 m3.yr-1).  \n\nUnder this scenario, this sub-cell presents a sediment deficit consistent with the erosive trend \n\nobserved by Lira et al. (2016). However, the same authors considered that the coastline changes \n\nhave a low magnitude that can be explained by the natural variability of the beach system. \n\nNotwithstanding, it was decided to confirm the compatibility of the eroded volumes with the \n\nsinks. The volume was estimated through a simple approach6, based on the LiDAR data of 2011 \n\nprovided by Direc\u00e7\u00e3o-Geral do Territ\u00f3rio and the data provide by Lira et al. (2016). The dune \n\nerosion rate obtained was 2.4\u00d7103 m3.yr-1, one order of magnitude lower than sediment sinks, \n\nsuggesting that harbour sedimentation rate proposed by LNEC (2010) is overestimated. These \n\ndune erosion is more compatible with the sedimentation rate of 1.7\u00d7103 m3.yr-1 (estimated \n\nbased on volume of the maintenance dredging presented by the same authors), or even with \n\nsediment loss related with the S\u00e3o Domingos dam (9\u00d7102 to 1.4\u00d7103 m3.yr-1). \n\n                                                           \n\n6 The coastline position (dune toe) for 2011 and 2012 were computed assuming the retreat rate (0.49 m.yr-1) and the \n\ncoastline position in 2010 (Lira et al., 2016). The projection of the coastline obtained for 2011 on the DTM acquired \nin the same year, coincides with the dune toe position observed from DTM (between 5 and 7 m elevations (MSL)). \nThus, considering that dune toe is at least 5 m, a sand volume eroded between 2011 and 2012 was computed based \non the DTM. \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n162 \n\nThe sediment deficit due to the source suppression, plus the weakening of the southward \n\ncomponent of longshore drift due to the sheltered promoted by the Peniche peninsula to the \n\ndominant NW waves, suggests that southward sediment bypassing at Consola\u00e7\u00e3o headland is \n\nnegligible and, this sub-cell can be assumed as a small closed system. Moreover, if the sediment \n\ndredged in the harbour since 2010, had been used to nourish the beach, the system should have \n\nbe in equilibrium. \n\nSUB-CELL 2 (CONSOLA\u00c7\u00c3O \u2013 LAMPOREIRA) \n\nThe main sediment sources of the sub-cell 2 are fluvial streams and cliff erosion (A ? 5.3\u00d7103 to \n\n1.3\u00d7104 m3.yr-1), given that HSB from updrift sub-cell and dune erosion are negligible. The \n\nsediment sinks are the sediment retention due to the SLR (B ? 2.6\u00d7103 m3.yr-1) and the \n\nLamporeira sediment bypassing (A-B). \n\nSUB-CELL 3 (LAMPOREIRA \u2013 ROCA) \n\nSediment sources of the sub-cell 3 are the HSB from the updrift sub-cell (A-B) and the fluvial \n\nstreams and cliff erosion (C ? 8.6\u00d7103 to 1.7\u00d7104 m3.yr-1). The sediment sinks are the SLR \n\n(D  ?  1.4\u00d7103 m3.yr-1) and the Roca sediment bypassing (A-B+C-D), because according to the \n\nmost recent information, the sediment captured by the Ericeira harbour (? 4.5\u00d7103 m3.yr-1) has \n\nbeen dredged and used in the nourishment of the updrift beach (Algodio beach). \n\nSUB-CELL 4 (ROCA \u2013 RASO) \n\nThis sub-cell is supplied by the HSB from the updrift sub-cell (A-B+C-D) and by fluvial streams \n\nand cliff erosion (E ? 1.4\u00d7103 to 1.5\u00d7103 m3.yr-1). Considering that Raso cape is a closed \n\nboundary, the sediment sinks are the Guincho-Cresmina dune filed (F ? 1.4\u00d7104 to \n\n2.8\u00d7104 m3.yr-1; Reb\u00ealo et al., 2002; Santos, 2006) and the SLR (G ? 353 m3.yr-1) that compared \n\nto the previous sink has low significance in the sediment budget (A-B+C-D+E-F-G). \n\nUnder the previous assumptions and considering all the scenarios (i.e. maximums and minimum \n\nvalues) the sediment budget of this sub-cell varies between -2\u00d7104 and +1\u00d7104 m3.yr-1. This \n\nresult is obviously conditioned by the uncertainties of the sediment sources and sink estimates, \n\nsuch as the uncertain related with resolution and temporal validity of the background \n\ninformation used in the RUSLE model; the simplification of the grain-size compatibility factors \n\napplied; and the interannual variability of the system, as for example, the aeolian transport rates \n\nestimated by Reb\u00ealo et al. (2002) and Santos (2006) for different time-intervals. Nevertheless, \n\nthe magnitude range of the Guincho sink is in agreement with magnitude range of the Roca \n\nsediment bypassing (? 1\u00d7104 to 3\u00d7104 m3.yr-1). \n\n\n\n Sediment Budget \n\n \n\n163 \n\nThe sediment budget indicate that sediment sources balance the sinks and that this littoral is in \n\nequilibrium, which is supported by the long-term stability of the studied beaches. Furthermore, \n\nthe results obtained also helped to define the magnitude of the net HSB at Lamporeira and Roca \n\nheadlands, in the order of 104 m3.yr-1. \n\n \n\nFigure 7.9.

These \n\nprocesses play an important role in the definition of the littoral sediment budget, having \n\nparticular relevance on headland-bay coasts. However, headland-bay beaches research has \n\nbeen focus on the beach planform stability and rotation, since these beaches are generally \n\nregarded as fairly closed systems. On the other hand, although there are several references to \n\nthe natural HSB in literature, few are those that focus on a detail description and \n\nconceptualization of these processes. For these reasons and taking into account that rocky \n\ncoasts encompass more than half of the world\u2019s coastline, the present study aimed to improve \n\nthe current understanding of HSB. \n\nTo archive this goal, the 100 km rocky coastal stretch between Carvoeiro and Raso capes, located \n\nat the Portuguese western coast, was chosen as a case study. This stretch includes headlands of \n\nseveral sizes and a set of beaches with variable length, orientation, embayment degree and \n\nexposure to the NW dominant waves. To identified and characterized the HSB processes \n\noccurring in this coast, it was fundamental to investigate depth, direction, frequency and \n\nmagnitude of these processes, as well as the characteristics of the sediment that bypass the \n\nheadlands. The research was based on morphological, sedimentological and oceanographic data \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n166 \n\nanalyses, a tracer field experiment and processes modelling. The results obtained were also used \n\nto define the sediment budget of the studied coast, supported by the analyses of the sediment \n\nsources/sinks and the long-term change trends of the beaches. \n\nThe HSB processes identified are presented in this chapter through conceptual models and, \n\ndiscussed considering the conceptual models described in the literature. This chapter includes \n\nalso a discussion about the sedimentary dynamics of the study coast considering the results \n\npresented in the previous chapters, the general conclusions and the guidelines for further \n\nresearch. \n\n CONCEPTUAL MODELS OF HEADLAND SEDIMENT BYPASSING \n\nThe literature review shows that currently there are three conceptual models to describe HSB: \n\n(1) the headland sandbar bypassing proposed by Short and Masselink (1999), which assumes \n\nthat the seaward beach rotation results in a sub-aqueous sand wave along the headland coast \n\nthat migrates downdrift and weld to the downdrift beach; (2) the sand strand bypassing \n\ndescribed by Smith (2001), where sediment that bypass the headlands is transported across the \n\ndowndrift embayment following a strand at an angle that depend on the null point of the wave \n\nrefraction orthogonal; and (3) the model described by Storlazzi and Field (2000), in which beach \n\nsediment is carried outside the embayment by the strong offshore flows during major storm \n\nevents, allowing it to be transported alongshore and feed the downdrift beach during low-\n\nenergy swells. \n\nIn the studied coast, a process similar to the one presented by Short and Masselink (1999) was \n\nidentified. It was observed that the persistence of NW, low-energy wave conditions, typical of \n\nthe summer season, induced beach rotation. In the low-degree embayments, beach planform \n\nrotation resulted in a continuous inner sandbar along the headland coast that migrates \n\ndowndrift and weld to the downdrift beach. However, beach rotation it is not necessarily related \n\nwith low-energy waves, being the persistence of a wave direction the main trigger mechanism \n\nof this process. The shoreline evolution modelling demonstrates that this process is clearly \n\ndominated by the longshore drift, occurring mainly in the intertidal zone and, eventually, in very \n\nshallow depths of the inner shelf. As this process is typical of the subaerial beach domain, was \n\nnamed as Beach headland Sediment Bypassing (BSB) (Figure 8.1). The sedimentological data \n\nshow that BSB is mainly related with coarse to medium sand. \n\n\n\nSynthesis and Conclusion \n\n \n\n167 \n\n  \n\nFigure 8.1. Conceptual model of the beach headland sediment bypassing (BSB): (A) initial condition; (B) beach \nrotation induced by a persistent wave direction and resulting inner sandbar; (C) merging of the inner sandbar \nwith the downdrift beach; (D) slightly accretion of the downdrift beach. \n\nIn the case of high-embayed beaches, the process described above cannot induce HSB, since the \n\nactive beach profile does not reach the tip of the headland. In these cases, the results obtained \n\nsuggest that sediment only can leave the embayment during high-energy wave conditions. \n\nDuring major storm events a severe beach erosion was observed, as result of the cross-shore \n\nsediment transport induced by strong seaward currents, in agreement with the Storlazzi and \n\nField (2000) model. The sediment that leaves the embayment is then distributed on the inner \n\nshelf and eventually transported alongshore, bypassing the headlands. When wave energy start \n\nto diminish the sediment is slowly transported onshore and start to merge with downdrift \n\nbeaches. This process is not exclusive of high-indented beaches and its frequency increases from \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n168 \n\nhigh- to low-degree embayment, i.e. as higher the embayment degree, the higher has to be the \n\nwave energy need to transport the sediment outside the bay. This HSB process is clearly \n\ntriggered by the increase of wave energy and, depends on both cross- and longshore transport \n\ncomponents, occurring at deeper waters, being named as inner Shelf headland Sediment \n\nBypassing (SSB) (Figure 8.2). The spatial distribution of the inner shelf sedimentary deposits \n\nindicate that SSB is related with medium to fine sand. Although, during major storm events, the \n\nwave conditions can trigger an extremely effective selection process, as demonstrated by the \n\nlarge heavy mineral placer deposit observed at Grande beach, capable to transport coarser \n\nparticles offshore. \n\n \n\nFigure 8.2. Conceptual model of the inner shelf headland sediment bypassing (SSB): (A) intial conditions; (B) \nbeach erosion induced by the strong offshore flow during high-energy wave conditions; (C) sediment \ntransport along the inner shelf; and (B) slow merge of the sediment that bypassed headland with the \ndowndrift beach, during low-energy wave conditions. \n\n\n\nSynthesis and Conclusion \n\n \n\n169 \n\nThe model proposed by Smith (2001), is not necessarily a different HSB process, but a model \n\nthat focus on the geometry of the HSB at the downdrift side. In fact, the sand strand described \n\nby this author, is compatible with the offshore sandbar, shallow attached sandbar or elongated \n\nspit observed by Short and Masselink (1999). However, as stated by Smith (2001), strand \n\nbypassing cannot develop when the seabed is sand starving and/or the downdrift beach is highly \n\ncurve in plan, because the projection of the strand along the wave refraction orthogonal may be \n\nimpossible. This means that geometry of the HSB depends on both, coastal geomorphology and \n\nsedimentary availability. In the studied coastal stretch it was noticed that, in the sandier \n\nstretches, HSB manifest itself through well-defined path, i.e. continuous inner or outer sandbars \n\nalong the headland coast. However, in the rockier stretches, the sediment spread on the rocky \n\nplatform, should be transported alongshore as thin, discontinuous and patchy sand bodies, as \n\nobserved and described by Storlazzi and Field (2000) and Hume et al. (2000). \n\n IMPLICATIONS OF THE HEADLAND SEDIMENT BYPASSING IN THE \n\nSEDIMENTARY DYNAMICS OF THE STUDY COASTAL STRETCH \n\nThe results presented in the previous chapters show that studied coast is segmented in four sub-\n\nsedimentary cell: (1) Carvoeiro-Consola\u00e7\u00e3o; (2) Consola\u00e7\u00e3o-Lamporeira; (3) Lamporeira-Roca; \n\nand (4) Roca-Raso. \n\nThe first sub-cell comprises the beach located between Peniche harbour and Consola\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nheadland, having particular characteristics due to shelter promoted by the Peniche peninsula to \n\nthe NW dominant waves, which reduce significantly the longshore sediment transport \n\nsouthward. The magnitude of the sediment sources within this sub-cell is extremely reduced \n\nand the only sink is the Peniche harbour that should capture the sediment transported \n\nnorthward, during SW wave conditions.  According to the sediment budget defined, this sub-cell \n\ncorresponds to a small closed system. \n\nThe other three sub-cells are macro scale embayments, which have similar sedimentary \n\ndynamics. The northern sectors of these embayments have a NW-SE or N-S general orientation \n\nand the net longshore drift is southward for both winter and summer wave conditions. Thus, \n\nheadlands in these sectors only can be crossed in a single direction (i.e. southward), \n\nindependently of the HSB process. The southern sectors, on the other hand, have a NE-SW \n\ngeneral orientation and the net longshore drift is southward, in the summer, and northward, in \n\nthe winter. Considering the higher persistence of NW waves during summer, HSB should occur \n\nmainly through the BSB process. In winter, wave directional spreading is larger and wave energy \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n170 \n\nincreases favouring the SSB. In low-indented beaches it is entirely possible that BSB and SSB \n\noccur simultaneously during storm conditions. However, the BSB northward is unlikely, \n\nconsidering the larger distances between the shoreline (beach berm) and the tip of the headland \n\nand the lower persistence of W and SW wave conditions. \n\nThe coexistence of the two HSB processes in the low-indented coastal stretches suggest that \n\nthey are decoupled. This assumption is also supported by the shoreline evolution modelling, \n\nwhich demonstrate that BSB is sufficient to justify the shoreline configuration of low-indented \n\ncoastal stretches, suggesting that in this case BSB is the dominant process. Otherwise, the \n\nshoreline configuration modelled should be significantly different from the observed one.  \n\nThe balance between the longshore transport components within the southern sectors of the \n\nmacro scale embayments, results in a sediment recirculation, which explains the sandy nature \n\nof inner shelf in these sectors. Otherwise, considering the lower magnitude of the sediment \n\nsources (in the order of  104 m3yr-1) compared to the longshore drift rate estimated based on \n\nthe tracer experiment and numerical modelling (in the order of 106 m3yr-1), the inner shelf should \n\nbe rocky, as the one in the northern stretches. \n\nThe sediment accumulation observed on the inner shelf of the southern sectors (of the macro \n\nscale embayments), is a consequence of the sediment recirculation described before, suggesting \n\nthat sediment can have a relatively long residence time inside these sub-cells. However, once \n\nsediment cross the sub-cell boundaries cannot reverse its movement, considering that at the \n\ndowndrift side of the most prominent headlands the net longshore drift is permanently \n\nsouthward. The frequency of the sediment linkage between the sub-cells depend on the \n\nseasonal and interannual wave climate variability, as shown by the beach morphological \n\nanalysis. The magnitude, on the other hand, depends on the balance between the sediment \n\nsources and sinks of each sub-cell and was estimated in the order of 104 m3.yr-1. \n\nAccording to the previous considerations a conceptual model for sedimentary dynamics of the \n\nstudy site is proposed and presented in Figure 8.3. \n\n\n\nSynthesis and Conclusion \n\n \n\n171 \n\n \n\nFigure 8.3. Conceptual model of the sedimentary dynamics for the studied coastal stretch. In the northern \nsectors, the sediment that leaves the embayments is sweeping southward, independently of the HSB process. \nIn the southern sectors, the sediment is transported southward during the summer, bypassing the headlands \nthrough the BSB process, and northward, in the winter, though the SSB process (and eventually through the \nBSB).    \n\n GENERAL CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER RESEARCH  \n\nThe work carried out in the scope of this thesis contributes to the headland sediment bypassing \n\nresearch. The results obtained through several approaches allowed to classify dominant \n\nheadland sediment bypassing processes in two main modes, which are in line with two of the \n\nexisting conceptual models. The processes were classified according to the prevailing domain \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n172 \n\nwhere sediment bypass the headlands as: 1) beach headland sediment bypassing (BSB) \u2013 a \n\nprocesses that takes place mainly at the subaerial section of the beach, and 2) inner shelf \n\nheadland sediment bypassing (SSB) \u2013 a processes that occurs on the submarine domain. BSB is \n\ntriggered by the persistence of incoming wave direction, is dominated by the longshore drift and \n\nis typical of low-indented coasts, where it plays a major role on the beach development and \n\nevolution. SSB is triggered by high-energy wave conditions, depend of both cross- and longshore \n\ntransport components and can occur in both low- and high-indented coasts. This latter process \n\nis particularly important in the development and evolution of high-indented beaches, where it \n\nis the only headland sediment bypassing process possible.  \n\nThe sedimentological analysis and tracer experiment showed that headland sediment bypassing \n\nis a selective process. Coarser particles such gravel and very coarse sand tend to be trapped \n\ninside the embayments, being their bypassing very low or negligible. Coarse sand bypass occurs \n\nmainly in the subaerial beach, except during major storm events, when the wave energy triggers \n\nan extreme efficient selective process, transporting the lighter sediment particles offshore \n\n(including coarser sands), originating heavy mineral placer deposits. This selective process can \n\ngenerate large placer deposits due to a long-term enrichment in heavy mineral particles. In the \n\ncase of medium sand particles, headland bypass can occur either subaerial beach or inner shelf \n\ndomain, depend on the wave energy; while fine sand bypass should occur mainly in the inner \n\nshelf. \n\nSEM-PLAT model results showed that headland sediment bypassing plays an important role in \n\nthe beach development and evolution and that, seasonal (and interannual) changes in the \n\nincident wave climate can significantly affect the beach configuration, putting in evidence the \n\ndelicate dynamic equilibrium of these beaches.  Moreover, modelling also suggest that the \n\nexposed rocky shore platform can be a major factor in the wave propagation and, consequently, \n\ninfluence the beach configuration. \n\nThe analysis of the sediment sources and sinks, long-term beach evolution, potential net \n\nlongshore drift patterns and bypassing constrains, allowed to define the sediment budget and \n\nsedimentary dynamics along the studied coast. The results indicate that beach systems between \n\nCarvoeiro and Raso capes are currently in equilibrium. The magnitude of the sediment bypassing \n\nat the most prominent headlands that segment the coast, depends on the balance between the \n\nsediment sources and sinks of each sub-cell and was estimated in the order of 104 m3.yr-1; while \n\nits frequency depends on the seasonal and interannual wave variability. \n\n\n\nSynthesis and Conclusion \n\n \n\n173 \n\nThe linkage of the studied beaches, through the headland sediment bypassing processes, and \n\ntheir delicate dynamic equilibrium, indicate that climate changes can have strong impacts on \n\ntheir evolution, either through sediment retention induced by sea-level rise or changes in \n\ntransport patterns due to wave climate rotation. \n\nThe conclusions of this study are constrained by the available data, in time and space, mainly in \n\nwhat concerns to the inner shelf, where data acquisition was more difficult. While BSB was \n\nclearly defined and relatively well-understood, the description of SSB is based on several \n\nassumptions that deserve further clarification and validation. Thus, future research should be \n\nfocused on the sedimentary transport along the inner shelf, including the exchanges with the \n\nbeach.  \n\nThe modelling approach also deserves further development, as the SEM-PLAT is still focused on \n\nBSB. The model revealed as a useful tool in the study of BSB and beach rotation processes but it \n\nshould be improved to account SSB. Furthermore, modelling approach can be also useful to \n\nforecast the impacts of climate changes, as well as in the management of headland-bay coastal \n\nstretches. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nHeadland Sediment Bypassing Processes \n\n \n\n174 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n175 \n\nReferences \n\nAagaard, T., Black, K.P., Greenwood, B.

SedPhoto2 is an \n\nupdated version to detect and count tracer particles using images acquired under both UV and \n\nwhite (WT) light, avoiding problems related with the presence of shells particles that reflected \n\nin the same spectral range of tracer particles. Furthermore, a function to extract the threshold \n\nvalues of the tracer particles on L*a*b colour space was also add. \n\nThis appendix includes the source code of the toolbox, examples of scripts using the toolbox and \n\nan example the tracer particles detection on images. \n\nSource code of SedPhoto2 \n\n \n\nclassdef SedPhoto2&lt;handle \n    % SedPhoto2 is MATLAB class to process sediment images. \n        % Detects and count fluorescent tracer particles in sediment \n        % images acquired under ultraviolet (UV) and white (WT) light, \n        % through the parallelepipedic cutoff method. \n\n         \n    properties \n        % Name of the input images \n        nameUVPhoto \n        nameWTPhoto \n\n         \n        % UV and WL images represented by RGB and L*a*b colour models \n        RGBUVPhoto \n        RGBWTPhoto \n        LabUVPhoto \n        LabWTPhoto \n\n         \n        % Thresholds for the parallelepipedic cutoff of \n        % tracer particles (defined by the user) \n        aTWT = 131 \n        bTWT = 153 \n        LTUV = 20 \n        aTUV = 132 \n        bTUV = 123  \n\n         \n        % Segmented image where 1 represents pixels above \n        % threshold level  \n        BWImage \n\n         \n        % Flat disk-shaped structuring elements with a radius of 2, \n        % used to comprise all pixels whose centers are no greater \n        % than 2 away from the origin \n        erosionDilationStructuringElement = strel('disk', 2);
