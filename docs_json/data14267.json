Sial*\n\nABSTRACT\n\nHolocene beachrocks of the Jaguaribe beach, State of Pernambuco, northeastern Brazil, consist of horizontal,\n\ncemented layers approximately 40 cm thick. The cement shows three textural varieties: (a) calciferous,\n\nsurrounding siliciclastic grains, (b) micritic, with an acicular fringe; and (c) cryptocrystalline calcite in pores.\n\nEarly cementation took place at the water table below beach ridges, where geochemical, hydrodynamic and,\n\nperhaps, also microbiological conditions favored rapid precipitation of aragonite and/or high-Mg calcite. ?13C\n\nvalues range from \u20131.8 to +1.5?/?? for dissolved carbonate in interstitial water and from +0.2 to +2.1?/?? for\nbioclastic components. ?18O values range from \u20132.8 to +0.5?/?? for seawater, freshwater and interstitial\nwater. ?13C values and diagenetic features suggest that cementation occurred in meteoric-vadose and/or\n\nmarine-phreatic water by loss of CO2 during evaporation of the interstitial water. Locally, superimposed low-\n\nMg calcite cements point to subsequent freshwater influence. Total-rock cement composition of vertically\n\nstacked beachrock beds at the Jaguaribe beach shows that the highest beachrock bed is older than the one\n\n(of same petrographic composition) situated at the current groundwater level. This implies a downward\n\nprogression of cementation, which probably followed the sea-level fall after a local high stand.\n\nKey words: beachrocks, early diagenesis, O and C isotopes, Holocene.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nBeachrocks are a common feature along the north-\n\neastern coastline of Brazil and have demanded a\n\nnumber of studies because of their role in the in-\n\nterpretation of coastal dynamics. Generally they\n\nare found parallel to the coastline as narrow, lin-\n\near ridges (two or more) separated from each other\n\nby sand and/or mud depressions.

This locality was chosen for\n\ndetailed study because factors that control the dis-\n\ntribution and rate of formation of these cemented\n\nzones are important in understanding early carbon-\n\nate diagenesis. The coastal erosion locally excavates\n\nthese beachrock beds, and slabs from them accumu-\n\nlate on the beach. Trenches and pits have been dug\n\nto follow beachrocks under beach.\n\nThe aim of this study is to illustrate the com-\n\nplexity of beachrock cementation and to discuss its\n\nrelation to sea level, and to synthesize their sedi-\n\nmentological and geochemical characteristics in or-\n\nder to model their depositional environment. The\n\nconclusions derived here have been substantiated by\n\nstable-isotope geochemistry.\n\nFACIES AND STRATIGRAPHY\n\nBeach sediments at the studied localities are com-\n\nposed mainly of quartz sands that also contain shells\n\nof bivalves and gastropods, foraminifera, and frag-\n\nments of calcareous algae (Halimeda and Litho-\n\nthamnium). Coarse- and fine-grained sand layers\n\nalternate to form beach lamination dipping slightly\n\nseaward. Coarse-grained layers usually are rich in\n\nbioclasts; and the predominating fine-grained lay-\n\ners contain mainly opaque minerals. Keystone vugs\n\noccur locally and indicate the upper beach facies.\n\nThe beach deposits overly a medium-grained\n\nfacies composed of sands and some bioclasts.

This facies succession implies a\n\nprogradation of terraces over beach deposits.\n\nCemented beds occur exclusively in beach fa-\n\ncies. The highest beachrock bed has been found\n\n(Fig. 2) about 40 cm above the beach face corre-\n\nsponding to low tide while the lowest cemented lay-\n\ners are situated at the water-influenced area. Beach-\n\nrocks contains 60-80% quartz grains, up to 10% bio-\n\nclastic fragments, and 2-10% (locally up to 20%)\n\ncement. Porosity is around 45%.\n\nAt the studied locality, incipient beachrocks are\n\nstill found inland some 50 m from the beach, about\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2005) 77 (2)\n\n\n\n346 N\u00daBIA C. GUERRA, CHANG H. KIANG and ALCIDES N. SIAL\n\n40 cm above the beach face. The beachrocks beds\n\nare 15-20 cm thick, some are continuous and can be\n\nfollowed over tens of meters along the beach where\n\nerosion has exposed them; others consist of isolated\n\nnodules (Fig. 2).\n\nThe surface of the cemented beds is usually\n\nslightly undulated and smooth and the lower sur-\n\nface can be very irregular and bumpy. Up to six\n\nvertically stacked beachrock levels have been\n\nobserved, separated from each other by loose\n\nsands (Fig. 2). Apart from the cements, the petro-\n\ngraphic composition of beachrocks beds and encas-\n\ning, non-consolidated beach sediments is the same.\n\nThe primary sedimentary structures (beach lamina-\n\ntion, keystone vugs, root traces) are preserved in the\n\nbeachrocks.\n\nCARBONATE CEMENTATION\n\nThe most common cement in the studied beach-\n\nrock consists of calcite (determination of mineral-\n\nogy by EDAX and Feigl\u2019s solution). Crystals usu-\n\nally are very small, but may locally reach 0.1 mm\n\nin length. They are very elongate and pointed or\n\ndisplay broader, lath-like shapes.\n\nAragonite typically occurs as acicular crystals\n\nforming fringes that are normally oriented to the\n\ngrain surfaces (Chaves 2000; Fig. 3A,B). In many\n\ncases the cement fringe is isopachous, i.e. of equal\n\nthickness, indicating marine phreatic precipitation\n\nwhere pores were constantly water-filled. Asym-\n\nmetric cement fringes and thicker underside of\n\ngrains, concentrated at grain contacts (Chaves 2000;\n\nFig. 3C,D), are recorded in some beachrocks, and in-\n\ndicate precipitation in the marine vadose zone (e.g.\n\nTaylor and Illing 1969).\n\nHigh- and low-Mg calcite usually forms mi-\n\ncritic cement coating grains or filling pores (Chaves\n\n2000; Fig. 3E,F). Micritization of grains is common\n\nin the beachrocks. If the meteoric groundwater is\n\nhigh in the backshore area, then low-Mg calcite ce-\n\nments may be precipitated in beachrocks in the upper\n\nintertidal zone.\n\nAragonite platelets occur locally and the ara-\n\ngonite crystals commonly form isopachous rims\n\naround the grains, thus implying cementation in\n\nwater-filled pores of a marine-phreatic diagenetic\n\nenvironment (Longman 1980). In many cases, a\n\nblack layer covers the grain surfaces and forms the\n\nbase of the aragonite cement. Such layers have\n\nbeen described from various other beachrocks (e.g.\n\nDavies and Kinsey 1973, Strasser and Davaud\n\n1986). Davies and Kinsey (1973) suggested that\n\nthey originated from organic mucus in which mi-\n\ncritic carbonate was precipitated and trapped, and\n\nwhich then served as nucleation site for the arago-\n\nnite crystals.\n\nMarine-phreatic aragonite cements are found\n\nin all studied samples, except in those of trench.\n\nSome samples contain high-Mg calcite (35-40 mol%\n\nMgCO3) displaying scalenohedral crystal forms.\n\nHigh-Mg calcite occurs together with aragonite, ei-\n\nther growing between the needles and platelets, or\n\nreplacing them laterally. The magnesium-rich cal-\n\ncite cements display an isopachous disposition and\n\nindicate a marine-phreatic environment (Longman\n\n1980). They occur in outcrop and pit, but are not\n\nassociated with a particular level of beachrock.\n\nMicritic cements (aragonite and/or high-Mg\n\ncalcite) form meniscus bridges linking the particles\n\ntogether (thus indicating the vadose zone; Longman\n\n1980), or fill the pores completely.\n\nCalcified organic filaments are rarely present\n\nand suggest participation of algae and/or fungi in the\n\nconsolidation of the beachrock. Micrite cements are\n\nlocally associated with aragonite or calcite crystals.\n\nMicritic cementation occurs in several samples and\n\nare the dominating types, and beachrock of hole 1\n\nis cemented entirely by micrite cement.\n\nSeveral samples show large crystals of low-Mg\n\ncalcite invading and growing over pre-existing arag-\n\nonite and/or high-Mg calcite cements. They formed\n\nin a freshwater diagenetic environment and are lim-\n\nited to beachrock beds above the water table or ex-\n\nposed on the beach, where rainwater could percolate.\n\nLocally, the cement covers organic filaments.\n\nRapid cementation was probably favored at the\n\nvadose/phreatic interface, i.e. at the continental wa-\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2005) 77 (2)\n\n\n\nPRECIPITATION OF BEACHROCK CEMENTS IN ITAMARAC\u00c1 ISLAND 347\n\nFig. 3 \u2013Acicular aragonite crystals (A, B); asymmetric fringes of calcite and aragonite\n\n(C, D); high- and low-Mg calcite, in micritic and fringe forms (respectively E and F).\n\nter. There, carbonate precipitation may be stimu-\n\nlated by evaporation of interstitial water (Taylor and\n\nIlling 1969) and/or CO2 degassing (Hanor 1978).\n\nWater percolation, and thus tidal pumping, may en-\n\nhance supply of ions. It has been shown by Given\n\nand Wilkinson (1985) that percolation rate influ-\n\nences mineralogy and crystal morphology of the\n\nprecipitated carbonate cements. Good permeability\n\nof the well-washed beach sands also explains why\n\ncementation occurs preferentially there. Mixing of\n\nmarine and fresh water at the water table can equally\n\nlead to cementation. Furthermore, the metabolic ac-\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2005) 77 (2)\n\n\n\n348 N\u00daBIA C. GUERRA, CHANG H. KIANG and ALCIDES N. SIAL\n\ntivity of bacteria, algae and fungi living in the sedi-\n\nment may influence pH and Eh conditions, and cer-\n\ntain organic substances can selectively precipitate\n\naragonite or calcite (Kitano and Hood 1965).\n\nMinor and trace elements (Table I) in beach-\n\nrocks cements demonstrate that, in the case of Jagua-\n\nribe beach, the relatively low strontium contents\n\n(1.69 to 1.77 ppm) and iron in the beachrock ce-\n\nments could (at least partly) be explained by assimi-\n\nlation of these elements by algae and bacteria. Low\n\nSr indicates that calcite cement was precipitated ini-\n\ntially as aragonite in meteoric water environment\n\naccording to Baker et al. (1982). Adsorption of\n\norganic matter on carbonate crystal surfaces (Suess\n\n1970) and fixation by cementation locally leads to\n\nblack beachrock layers, which, when eroded, break\n\ninto black pebbles (Strasser 1984). At site, where\n\nblack beachrock is formed, abundant organic mat-\n\nter is furnished by marine plants (Cymodoceans),\n\nwhich are washed onto the beach during storms and\n\nthen decay.\n\nThe large variety of parameters controlling\n\nbeachrock cementation may explain the complex re-\n\nlationships and irregular distribution of the various\n\ntypes of cement. Superposition of different cements\n\nindicates changing of parameters through time and\n\nspace. Early consolidation is dominated by marine\n\n(phreatic or vadose) cements precipitating at or close\n\nto the water table.\n\nBeachrock situated above the water table un-\n\ndergoes freshwater diagenesis. Percolating rainwa-\n\nter locally dissolves unstable aragonite and high-\n\nMg calcite cements and precipitates low-Mg calcite.\n\nPercolation rate is high along root shafts or in the\n\nholes left after their decay. This leads to cemented\n\nprotuberances at the bottom of the beachrock beds\n\nwhere the roots penetrated. Freshwater cementation\n\nseals primary porosity and hardens the beachrock\n\nsignificantly. Once exposed by erosion beachrock\n\nmay superficially be further cemented by freshwater\n\ndiagenesis or by carbonate precipitation from ma-\n\nrine spray waters (Scoffin 1970).\n\nCoexistence of various types of cement\n\nin beachrock is common (e.g. Stoddart and Cann\n\nTABLE I\n\nMinor and trace elements (ppm) of\n\nbeachrock cements from Jaguaribe beach\n\nin Itamarac\u00e1 island (Chaves 2000).\n\nITA-1 ITA-2 ITA-3 ITA-4\n\nNa 5.39 4.45 5.39 5.39\n\nK 1.15 1.09 0.99 1.12\n\nCa 117 115 119 120\n\nSr 1.74 1.72 1.69 1.77\n\nMg 4.61 5.66 4.22 4.98\n\nFe 2.76 2.54 2.23 2.33\n\nMn 0.03 0.05 0.07 0.02\n\nAl 1.20 1.46 0.97 1.05\n\n1965, Taylor and Illing 1969, Beier 1985, Strasser\n\nand Davaud 1986, Pirazzoli 1991). Fine-grained\n\nbeach sediment has to be stabilized by burial in order\n\nto allow cementation. Roots and organic filaments\n\nmay enhance stabilization. Blocks of beach con-\n\nglomerate on the other hand can be heavy enough to\n\nresist constant dislocation by waves and cementation\n\ncan well occur without previous burial (Montaggioni\n\nand Pirazzoli 1984 in Pirazzoli 1991). Sediment\n\ntrapped in fissures of exposed beachrock or between\n\npebbles of beach conglomerate will equally be in-\n\ncorporated. Fragments of beer bottles cemented into\n\nbeachrock demonstrate that carbonate precipitation\n\ncan be very rapid (Scoffin 1970).\n\nDIAGENETIC FACIES\n\nBeachrocks from the Jaguaribe beach look identi-\n\ncal to any other in the littoral of Pernambuco. The\n\ninclusion of recent artifacts in many of these de-\n\nposits demonstrates that they are continuously be-\n\ning formed today. Petrographically, rare aragonite\n\ncement micritized grains and micritic envelopes all\n\nof which are products of marine-phreatic diagene-\n\nsis characterize this beachrock. Carbon and oxy-\n\ngen isotopic compositions of beachrock cement and\n\nuncemented sand are nearly identical; ?13C varies\n\nbetween \u20132.0?/?? and +3.6?/?? and ?18O between\n\u20132.1?/?? to +1.3?/?? .\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2005) 77 (2)\n\n\n\nPRECIPITATION OF BEACHROCK CEMENTS IN ITAMARAC\u00c1 ISLAND 349\n\nTABLE II\n\n?13C and ?18O values for beachrocks at Jaguaribe beach in Itamarac\u00e1 Island (A) seawater, freshwater\n\nand interstitial water (B) dissolved carbonate in the interstitial water; (C) primary carbonates.\n\nA B C\n\nWater ?18OSMOW ?\n18OSMOW ?\n\n18OPDB ?\n13CPDB Bioclastic ?\n\n18OPDB ?\n13CPDB\n\nsamples (?/?? ) (?/?? ) (?/?? ) (?/?? ) samples (?/?? ) (?/?? )\nIta-1\u00a4 \u20132.3 \u20131.7 \u20132.8 +0.5 Halimeda-1 \u20132.5 +0.2\n\nIta-2\u00a4 \u20132.5 \u20130.6 \u20133.1 +0.6 Halimeda-2 \u20132.4 +0.4\n\nIta-3\u00a4 \u20130.8 \u20130.9 \u20132.4 \u20131.8 Halimeda-3 \u20132.3 +1.7\n\nIta-4\u00a4 \u20131.5 \u20131.8 \u20131.9 +0.7 Halimeda-4 \u20131.7 +1.5\n\nIta-5\u00a4 \u20131.0 \u20132.0 \u20132.2 +0.9 Halimeda-5 \u20132.0 +2.1\n\nIta-6\u00a4 \u20132.4 \u20130.8 \u20131.8 +1.5 Halimeda-6 \u20132.2 +1.6\n\nIta-7* +0.2 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Foram-1 \u20132.7 +0.5\n\nIta-8* +0.5 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Lithothamium-1 \u20131.9 +1.3\n\nIta-9** \u20132.8 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Bivalves-1 \u20132.6 +0.8\n\nIta-10** \u20132.2 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Gastropods-1 \u20132.4 +0.3\n\n\u00a4 = interstitial water; * = seawater; ** = freshwater.\n\nCarbon-isotope values for seawater, freshwa-\n\nter, interstitial water and primarily carbonates, of\n\nbeachrock samples, show a general depletion in 13C\n\nand 18O relative to carbonates precipitated in equi-\n\nlibrium with seawater (Table II). The cement has\n\na wider range of ?13C values than marine cements\n\nowing to the mixing of carbon from soil gas and\n\ndissolved carbonate sediment (Gross 1964). Block\n\nlow-Mg calcite has 13C/12C ratios closest to those\n\nof marine cements suggesting that most carbon in\n\nprecipitation fluids is derived from dissolution of\n\nmetastable carbonates (e.g. present-day aragonite).\n\nIn these beachrocks, carbon-isotope ratios\n\nof whole-rock samples vary according to the pro-\n\nportion and isotopic composition of vadose and\n\nmeteoric-phreatic cements. One whole-rock sample\n\nthat is very enriched in 12C suggests that some ce-\n\nment may be even lighter than those analyzed. Iso-\n\ntopic exchange during recrystallization of allochems\n\nmay also contribute to 12C enrichment of whole-\n\nrock samples. The oxygen-isotope composition is\n\nalso the result of diagenetic alteration by meteoric\n\nwater and is controlled by ?18O of local rainfall,\n\nwhich is 16O-enriched relative to seawater (Allan\n\nand Matthews 1977).\n\nMany beachrock allochems are partially to\n\ncompletely micritized. Micritization of grains most\n\nextensive at and in some cases limited to grain\n\nboundaries and results in development of a micritic\n\nrim or envelope around each grain. In some in-\n\nstances aragonitic cement is also micritized. Mi-\n\ncritic cement is most strongly depleted in 13C owing\n\nto increased organic activity.\n\nThere is an extensive evidence of organic ac-\n\ntivity. Small (10-20 \u00b5m in diameter) pits and tubes\n\nare abundant on beachrock surfaces. The exclusive\n\npresence of aragonitic cement in this rock suggest\n\nthat lithification of beach sediments was predomi-\n\nnantly a marine process. There is no petrographic\n\nevidence of meteoric interstitial influence in the pre-\n\ncipitation of these beachrock cements and therefore\n\nno need to invoke seawater/interstitial mixing mod-\n\nels to explain the cementation process. The iso-\n\ntopic composition also indicates precipitation from\n\nmixing sea/meteoric water. The rapid growth of\n\naragonite crystals in beach sediments is readily ac-\n\ncounted for in terms of seawater supersaturation and\n\nenhancement of conditions for precipitation by el-\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2005) 77 (2)\n\n\n\n350 N\u00daBIA C.

SIAL\n\nevated temperature evaporation and by fluctuations\n\nof the pH and PCO2 due to photosynthesis by algae\n\nliving in and on the beach sand.\n\nThe algae are also responsible for micritization.\n\nThe formation of micritic cement has long been at-\n\ntributed to the filling algal borings with minute crys-\n\ntals of secondary calcium carbonate (Bathurst 1966,\n\nAlexandersson 1972a, b).\n\nThis beachrock exhibits other assemblages of\n\ndiagenetic features that include equant low-Mg cal-\n\ncite cement. Neomorphic transformation of arag-\n\nonite cement and micritic low-Mg calcite. These\n\ncontain abundant coarse crystals of equant low-Mg\n\ncalcite cement. This sparry calcite completely fills\n\nintergranular voids in some cases thus greatly re-\n\nducing porosity. The cement is partly originated\n\nfrom neomorphism of marine aragonitic cement and\n\npartly from direct precipitation in voids. Some cal-\n\ncite crystals adjacent to grain boundaries are ori-\n\nented normal to the grain surface suggesting an orig-\n\ninally fibrous texture; crystals in the center of the\n\npores lack such orientation. Locally aragonite and\n\nblock calcite cement coexist where neomorphism is\n\nincomplete.\n\nThe large size of spar crystals suggests precipi-\n\ntation from water-filled pores in a meteoric-phreatic\n\nenvironment (Land 1970). The distribution of spar\n\ncement is however patchy suggesting that precipita-\n\ntion of spar may have occurred in a microphreatic\n\nenvironment within vadose zone.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nSeveral conclusions can be drawn from the study of\n\ncontemporaneous beachrock on the Jaguaribe beach\n\nthat may also be relevant for beachrock occurrences\n\nin other areas and other geological epochs:\n\n(1) Beachrock forms through cementation of beach\n\nsediment, which generally has been stabilized\n\nby burial and in many cases also by filaments\n\nof algae and fungi. Primary sedimentary struc-\n\ntures such as beach lamination, keystone vugs\n\nor root traces are commonly preserved.\n\n(2) The phreatic/vadose interface at the groundwa-\n\nter table offers geochemical and hydrodynamic\n\nconditions, which may be favorable for rapid\n\nprecipitation of calcium carbonate. Microbio-\n\nlogical activity may further stimulate cemen-\n\ntation. Sediment above and below the active\n\nzone of cementation is not consolidated.\n\n(3) Juxtaposition and superposition of various\n\ntypes of cement suggests that geochemical hy-\n\ndrodynamic and/or microbiological parameters\n\nchanged through time and space. After a first\n\nstage of cementation leading to consolidation\n\nthe beachrock may be further cemented in the\n\nvadose or phreatic zones or during exposure on\n\nthe beach after erosion.\n\n(4) Some particles can be relict and older than the\n\nfinal beach sediment. On the other hand ce-\n\nmentation starts some time after sedimentation\n\nand may still go on after a long time. Total\n\nbeachrock ages are therefore maximum ages\n\nfor the beginning of cementation.\n\n(5) As beachrock cementation probably starts at or\n\nclose to the interstitial water its stratigraphic\n\nand topographic position may indicate the po-\n\nsition of sea level at the time when cementation\n\nbegan.\n\n(6) Coastal erosion and wave action however fre-\n\nquently undercut and break off beachrock beds\n\nand slabs of beachrock accumulate in the inter-\n\ntidal or shallow subtidal zones. Such fragments\n\ncan be easily identified and used to approxi-\n\nmately situate ancient sea levels.\n\nThe diagenetic cements of intertidal beachrock\n\nindicate sediment alteration in a variety of diage-\n\nnetic environments. Relict aragonite-needle and mi-\n\ncritic cement although rare indicate early diagene-\n\nsis in a marine-phreatic environment. Blocky spar\n\ncements are characteristic of meteoric-phreatic di-\n\nagenesis. This environment must have developed\n\nafter early diagenesis in the marine-phreatic zones\n\nbecause neomorphic calcite replaces aragonite ce-\n\nment. The isotopic composition of the vadose fea-\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2005) 77 (2)\n\n\n\nPRECIPITATION OF BEACHROCK CEMENTS IN ITAMARAC\u00c1 ISLAND 351\n\ntures indicates that they were not precipitated from\n\nthe same water, as the spar cement and. therefore\n\nthe precipitation of spar cement was not contempo-\n\nraneous with formation of the vadose features.\n\nThe following model for a progressive diage-\n\nnetic sequence is proposed that pass through a cycle\n\nof local sea level changes.\n\nThe first diagenetic stage is typified by rock\n\nlike that of the Holocene beachrock facies. Arag-\n\nonite cement is evidence that marine-phreatic pro-\n\ncesses are dominant in the intertidal zone and that\n\nlithification occurs in this zone. The even coating\n\nof aragonite cement on sediment grains indicates\n\nthat these crystals precipitated from pores filled with\n\nnormal seawater. Colonization by algae and subse-\n\nquent micritization of cement alter the newly lithi-\n\nfied beachrock and result in the formation of well\n\nmicritic cement around each grain.\n\nAs long as the beachrock occupies the intertidal\n\nzone growth of aragonite cement and organic activ-\n\nity will continue. New sand composed by corals\n\nfragments and other debris are cemented onto the\n\nbeachrock surface. Large slabs of beachrock may\n\nbe dislodged during marine transgression or storms\n\nand re-cemented into the intertidal deposits building\n\nancient beachrocks lines. In this earliest stage of\n\ndiagenesis, grazing intertidal organisms commonly\n\nerode beachrocks surface.\n\nIn the second stage a lowering of sea level\n\nmoves the shoreline seaward leaving to that of their\n\ndeposition. Here, the beachrock would most likely\n\nbecome buried by marine deposits (terraces) as evi-\n\ndenced by burial beach sediments. During this inter-\n\nval, the sediment is in contact with meteoric intersti-\n\ntial water. The meteoric water probably contained\n\nin a local phreatic environment within the vadose\n\nzone rather than an extensive interstitial lens as evi-\n\ndenced by the discontinuous distribution of the spar\n\ncements. The most important process in this stage\n\nis a neomorphic replacement of early aragonite ce-\n\nment by larger crystals of low-Mg calcite and pre-\n\ncipitation of low-Mg calcite in pores. Reduction\n\nof porosity is greatest in this stage because low-Mg\n\ncalcite completely fills some pores.\n\nWith further lowering of sea level the beach-\n\nrock deposits are left even farther inland. In this\n\nenvironment interference by organic process by ter-\n\nrestrial plants (coconut trees). The extent of va-\n\ndose and freshwater diagenetic features indicates\n\nthat the more ancient beachrock had occupied an\n\ninland position for a relatively long time and, there-\n\nfore, this beachrock was possibly deposited during\n\nthe Holocene.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis study is a part of N.S.

O cimento ocorre sob tr\u00eas tipos: a) cal-\n\nc\u00edtico, circundando os gr\u00e3os silicicl\u00e1sticos, b) micr\u00edtico,\n\ncom uma franja acicular; e c) preenchendo os poros na\n\nforma de calcita criptocristalina. A cimenta\u00e7\u00e3o, precoce,\n\naconteceu ao n\u00edvel fre\u00e1tico abaixo da crista praial, onde\n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es geoqu\u00edmicas, hidrodin\u00e2micas e, talvez, micro-\n\nbiol\u00f3gicas favoreceram uma r\u00e1pida precipita\u00e7\u00e3o de ara-\n\ngonita e/ou calcita magnesiana. ?13C varia de \u20131.8 a\n\n+1.5?/?? para carbonato dissolvido em \u00e1gua intersticial\ne de +0.2 a +2.1?/?? para componentes biocl\u00e1sticos.\n?18O varia de \u20132.8 a +0.5?/?? na \u00e1gua do mar, \u00e1gua doce\ne intersticial. ?13C e fei\u00e7\u00f5es diagen\u00e9ticas sugerem que a\n\ncimenta\u00e7\u00e3o ocorreu em \u00e1gua mete\u00f3rica-vadosa e/ou mari-\n\nnha-fre\u00e1tica, por perda de CO2 durante a evapora\u00e7\u00e3o da\n\n\u00e1gua intersticial. Localmente, cimento calc\u00edtico pouco\n\nmagnesiano superimposto sugere influ\u00eancia de \u00e1gua doce\n\nsubseq\u00fcente.
