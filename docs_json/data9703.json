Os comp\u00f3sitos de poliuretano e \u00f3xido de zinco (PU/ZnO) mostram-\nse promissores, pois qualquer dos materiais, em separado, tem revelado \npropriedades biom\u00e9dicas interessantes. No entanto, as propriedades da \nmistura de ambos ainda n\u00e3o est\u00e3o totalmente esclarecidas. \u00c0s pr\u00f3prias \nnanopart\u00edculas ou nanoestruturas de ZnO s\u00e3o apontados desempenhos \namb\u00edguos, que tornam imprevis\u00edveis as respectivas respostas biol\u00f3gicas.  \nEste trabalho tem, assim, como principal objectivo, estudar o efeito da \nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o, forma e tamanho de part\u00edcula de ZnO nas propriedades de \ncomp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO, designadamente na sua bioactividade in vitro e resposta \ncelular. Com esse objectivo sintetizaram-se part\u00edculas de ZnO \nnanoestruturadas, por precipita\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica, que foram caracterizadas \ncomparativamente com nanopart\u00edculas de ZnO comerciais. Avaliaram-se as \nfases presentes, cristalinidade, forma e tamanho de part\u00edcula, \u00e1rea superficial \nespec\u00edfica e porosidade. Posteriormente formularam-se comp\u00f3sitos de matriz \npolim\u00e9rica (poliuretano), carregados com as part\u00edculas de ZnO (2% e 50% em \npeso) e submeteram-se os comp\u00f3sitos a ensaios de bioactividade in vitro e de \nviabilidade celular (linha MC3T3). Os ensaios de bioactividade revelaram que \nos comp\u00f3sitos com 50% ZnO, nomeadamente os comp\u00f3sitos com nanoesferas \nde ZnO, s\u00e3o potencialmente mais bioactivos que o poliuretano ou os \ncomp\u00f3sitos com 2% ZnO. Por seu lado, os estudos de viabilidade celular \nrevelaram que os comp\u00f3sitos com 2% ZnO e o pol\u00edmero s\u00e3o os que \napresentam maior viabilidade celular. Verificou-se que no caso das part\u00edculas \ncomerciais ou nanoestruturadas o efeito de 50% de carga \u00e9 similar ao efeito \ndas pr\u00f3prias part\u00edculas, induzindo citotoxicidades muito semelhantes. Os \ncomp\u00f3sitos que continham nanoesferas de ZnO (50% em peso) evidenciaram \ncitotoxicidade superior aos outros. Estes comportamentos s\u00e3o discutidos com \nbase na quantidade de cati\u00f5es Zn\n\n2+\n libertados para o meio.  \n\nEm conclus\u00e3o, os resultados obtidos mostram que \u00e9 poss\u00edvel controlar a \nbioactividade e citotoxicidade dos comp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO atrav\u00e9s da manipula\u00e7\u00e3o \nda concentra\u00e7\u00e3o ou morfologia de part\u00edcula de ZnO e, por esta via, desenhar \ncomp\u00f3sitos com potencialidades para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es ortop\u00e9dicas (comp\u00f3sitos com \n2% em peso) e comp\u00f3sitos para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es em que se pretende travar a \nprolifera\u00e7\u00e3o celular, como no tratamento do cancro (comp\u00f3sitos com 50% em \npeso). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nkeywords \n\n \nComposite, zinc oxide, polyurethane, nanoparticles, biomedical aplications, \nMC3T3 cells \n \n\nabstract \n\n \nThe present work is focused on the preparation and characterization of \nbiomedical devices able to elicit different biological responses. \nPolyurethane/zinc oxide composites (PU/ZnO) appear as very promising \nmaterials as they may combine the interesting biomedical properties of ZnO \nand PU. However the properties of the composites, particularly in what the \nbiological response is concerned, are far from being completely known. They \nare even unpredictable when ZnO nanoparticles or nanostructures are involved \nas ambiguous behaviours have been pointed out to nanometric sized ZnO \nparticles. \nThe main objective of the present work is to study the effects of the shape, size \nand concentration of ZnO particle on the properties of PU/ZnO composites, \nparticularly on its bioactivity and cellular response.  \nFor this purpose ZnO nanoparticles/nanostructures were synthesized by a \nchemical precipitation method and subsequently characterized in terms of \ncrystal phase composition, crystallinity, shape and particle size, specific surface \narea and porosity. These properties were further compared to those of \ncommercial ZnO nanoparticles counterparts. PU/ZnO composites were then \nformulated by loading a PU matrix with ZnO particles (2 and 50%wt) and then \nsubmitted to in vitro bioactivity tests in SBF and to cell viability assays using a \nMC3T3 cell line. The bioactivity assays revealed that 50%wt ZnO loaded \ncomposites, namely those loaded with ZnO nanospheres, are potentially more \nbioactive than both PU and 2%wt PU/ZnO composites. Regarding cell viability, \n2%wt PU/ZnO formulations were found to be the composites ensuring the \nhigher cell viability. It was also shown that the toxicity effects of the 50%wt \nPU/ZnO composites prepared either with commercial or precipitated \nnanostructured ZnO particles were very similar to the toxicity effects of the \ncorresponding isolated ZnO particles. As for the composites prepared with ZnO \nnanospheres (50%wt Pu/ZnO), their toxicity was higher than the remaining \ncomposites. These behaviours were discussed based on Zn\n\n2+\n release to SBF \n\nmedia. \nAs a conclusion, the obtained results show that it is possible to control PU/ZnO \ncomposites bioactivity and cytotoxicity by manipulating the concentration and/or \nZnO particle morphology, thereby enabling the design of composites with \npotential usefulness for orthopaedic applications (2 %wt PU/ZnO) or for \nbiomedical purposes  intended to retard cellular proliferation like cancer \ntreatment (50 %wt PU/ZnO). \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n \n\ni \n\n \n\nList of abbreviations \n\n1,2-D* - 1,2-Dichloroethane \n\n3T3  - Fibroblast cell line \n\nA549 - Glandular cancerous cell line \n\nATR-\n\nFTIR \n- \n\nAttenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared \n\nspectroscopy \n\nB - Brushite \n\nBD - 1,4-buthanediol  \n\nBDO - 1,4-buthanediol  \n\nBET - Braunauer, Emmet and Teller \n\nBJH - Barret, Joyner, Halenda  \n\nC** - Chloroform \n\nC2 - 2% composite with commercial ZnO nanosized powder \n\nC50 - 50% composite with commercial ZnO nanosized powder \n\nCDDS - Controlled drug delivery systems  \n\nCit - Citric acid \n\nCNS - Central nervous system  \n\nCP - Calcium phosphate  \n\ncZnO - Commercial ZnO nanosized powder \n\nDSC - Differential scan calorimetry \n\nED - Ethylenediamine \n\nEDS - Energy dispersive spectroscopy  \n\nESD - Equivalent sphere diameter \n\nFDA - Food and drug agency \n\nHA - Hydroxyapatite \n\nHBP - Human blood plasma \n\nHeLa - Immortalized cervical cancer cell line \n\nHL60 - Leukaemia cell line \n\nHMDI - Hydrogenated diphenylmethane-diisocyanate \n\nICP - Inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy \n\nIUPAC - International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry \n\nM - Monetite \n\n MC3T3-\nE1 \n\n- Osteoblast cell line \n\nMDI - Diphenylmethane-diisocyanate \n\nmZnO - Precipitated ZnO nanostructured powder \n\nNPs - Nanoparticles \n\nNT - Nanotechnology \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n \n\nii \n\n \n\nP2 - 2% composite with precipitated ZnO nanostructured powder \n\nP50 - 50% composite with precipitated ZnO nanostructured powder \n\nPA - Polyethylene adipate  \n\nPBMC - Mononuclear blood cell line \n\nPDT - Photo dynamic therapy \n\nPHECD - Poly(1,6-hexyl 1,2 ethyl carbonate)diol  \n\nPNS - Peripheral nerve tissues  \n\nPTMEG - Polytetramethylene ether glycol  \n\nPTMG - Polytetramethylene ether glycol  \n\nPTMO - Polytetramethylene ether glycol  \n\nPU - Polyurethane \n\npZnO - Precipitated ZnO nanostructured powder \n\nR - Gas constant \n\nR2 - 2% composite with precipitated ZnO nanosized powder \n\nR50 - 50% composite with precipitated ZnO nanosized powder \n\nRKO - Colon cancer cell line \n\nROS - Reactive oxygen species \n\nrZnO - Precipitated nanosized ZnO powder \n\nSBF - Simulated body fluid  \n\nSEM - Scan electron microscopy \n\nT cells - Type of white blood cell line \n\nTDI - Toluene diisocyanate  \n\nU87 - Glial cancer cell line \n\nUV - Ultra violet light \n\nXRD - X-ray diffraction \n\nZP - Zinc phosphate \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n \n\niii \n\n \n\nList of symbols \n\n    - Hydroxyl radical \n\n     - Hydroperoxyl radical \n\n     - Superoxide radical anion \n\nam - Adsorbate molecule area \n\nC - Carbon \n\nD - Crystallite size  \n\ndAV - Average pore size  \n\ndhkl - \nDistance between two crystallographic  parallel \n\nplanes \n\nDp - Pore diameter \n\n   - Conduction band promoted electron \n\n    ?

Introduction \n\n \n\nZinc oxide (ZnO) is a wide band gap piezoelectric semiconductor with large exciton \n\nbinding energy used in numerous electronic applications. Moreover, under specific light \n\nwavelengths ZnO may undergo free-radical reactions and exhibit cytotoxicity and \n\nantibacterial/fungi properties which suggest its medical usefulness. Furthermore, being a \n\nbroad spectrum UV reflector, ZnO is also a primary choice as sunscreen additive for \n\ncosmetic products. ZnO is also a Food and Drug Agency (FDA) approved compound. \n\nHowever, as observed for nanosized materials in general, the biological effects of \n\nnanosized or nanostructured ZnO particles are still poorly understood. There is a large \n\ncontroversy on the effects these particles on both human health and environment, as many \n\ncontradicting aspects being reported. Nanosized particles are generally addressed to be \n\npotentially harmful to human health if not properly controlled and thus the interest of \n\nconfinement in a polymer matrix is very appealing. This strategy may be useful when \n\naiming at a local targeted action [1-35]. \n\nPolyurethanes (PUs) are materials of extreme relevance due to their chemical properties, \n\nmechanic and possible biodegradability. These characteristics allied to the facile \n\nprocessing methods allows their regular use in the medical area as ventricular devices, \n\ndiaphragms, heart valves, bioactive vascular grafts, catheters and other devices. PUs, \n\nnamely tecoflex SG80A PU, is also an FDA approved material and even with its own \n\nintrinsic limitations presents itself as potential confining matrix as a way to control the \n\nexposure level of these particles [36-47]. \n\nPU/ZnO composites are reported for nerve guide channels, catheters or osteoconductive \n\nstrategies. The addition of ZnO nanoparticles/nanostructures to PU will inevitably change \n\nthe polymer properties, but as such changes have been inconsistently reported, the \n\nbiological response to the composite itself also becomes unpredictable [5, 10]. \n\nThe purpose of the present work is to study the potential of polyurethane/zinc oxide \n\n(PU/ZnO) nanocomposites for biomedical applications. The manipulation of some specific \n\nproperties of ZnO particles such as shape, size and porosity, are carried out and their \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n4 \n\n \n\nimpact on polyurethane/ZnO composites properties are evaluated, while accessing the \n\nresulting composites in vitro behaviour. \n\n \n\n1.1. Nanocomposites \n\n \n\nComposite materials combining a polymer matrix and nanometric sized particles \n\n(nanoparticles) are envisaged as promising materials for the near future, referred here as \n\nnanocomposites, as they offer the superior properties of nanoparticles while benefiting  \n\nfrom the polymer processing technology [1]. \n\nIt can be roughly stated that polymer/nanoparticles nanocomposites can be prepared \n\nthrough four routes, [1]: \n\n? Solution method: consists on the dissolution of the polymer followed by the \n\ndispersion of the nanoparticles in the polymer solution and then by the evaporation \n\nof the solvent. \n\n? Melt mixing: the polymer is melted and mixed with the filler and then \n\nhomogenised. \n\n? In-situ polymerization: the nanoparticles are dispersed in the pre-polymer solution \n\nand polymerization is subsequently promoted. \n\n? Template synthesis: using polymer templates the nanoparticles are precipitated \n\nwithin the polymer pores from a precursor solution (particle size is strongly \n\ndependent on the polymer pore size distribution). \n\n \n\nNanometric sized particles (nanoparticles)  are known since several decades but their \n\neffects and properties as polymer nanofillers are not yet clearly known. Furthermore as \n\nnanoparticles themselves still pose some challenging issues, they will be specifically \n\naddressed in the next section. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n5 \n\n \n\nA. Nanoparticles \n\n \n\nIn the XXI century nanoparticles production revealed itself as a key technology that would \n\nallow a technological and industrial development as the automobile, computers and \n\ncommunication technologies did in the last century [2]. \n\nPrompted by the exceptional properties exhibited by nanoparticles, the research efforts of \n\nthe scientific community to develop nanoparticles (NPs) and nanotechnologies (NT) have \n\nincreased in the latest years. The global market also sticks to this tendency as the \n\ninvestment has kept increasing throughout the years with an increase in the nanomaterials \n\nbusiness value (figure 1 and table 1) [2, 3]. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.

Worldwide nanomaterials interest by region, adapted from [2]. \n\n \n\nPart of the interest raised by the nanoparticles relies on the fact that as the particle size \n\ndiminishes its specific surface area \u2018SSA\u2019 increases, providing larger contact areas, \n\nenhanced reactivity and a higher number of surface atoms or defects per unit area. The \n\nphysical and chemical properties of the materials can change drastically as the particle size \n\ngoes down to the nanometric scale and thus become significantly different from those of \n\nthe bulk material. Various examples include insulator materials that become conductive, \n\ninsoluble becoming more soluble and cytotoxicity changes as well. Some newly discovered \n\nparticles worthy of mention have generated a particular interest in the chemical and \n\nsemiconductors industries, namely some metallic oxides as aluminium, cerium, iron, zinc, \n\ntitanium, silicon oxides, nanoclays, some metals like silver and gold, some polymers \n\nincluding dendrimers, fluorenes and polystyrene, and others as carbon black and nanotubes \n\n[2]. \n\nThe health area is raising a great interest for nanoparticles as observed in the drug delivery \n\nfield as their high surface area and adsorptive properties allow the fixation and transport of \n\nrelevant biological compounds or drugs to specific sites, improving the performance of \n\ncontrolled drug delivery systems [3, 4]. \n\nTissue engineering is also an area with great expectations regarding nanoparticles because \n\ntheir nanometric size allows the mimetization of nanosized proteins and their high SSA \n\nand topographical nanoroughness allows the adsorption of specific proteins, a critical stage \n\nYear Region Market Value\n2003 World Nanoproducts \u2013 business value xx billions US$\n\n2003 World R&amp;D - public investment 3 billion US$\n\n2005 World Nanotecnology - investment 5 to 7 billion US$\n\n2006 U.S.A.

The anthropogenic nanoparticles can be unintentionally released, like in \n\nfossil fuels combustions, or can be engineered and designed to suit a certain purpose \n\n(engineered nanoparticles) [1].  \n\nNanometric sized particles are normally classified in the following categories (figure 2): \n\nnanoparticles, nanosheets, and nanorods [1]: \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Shape of nanomaterials: nanoparticles, nanotubes and nanosheets, adapted from \n\n[1]. \n\nNanoparticles are those particles in which all the three dimensions are under 100 nm, \n\nnanotubes are those that have a high length/diameter ratio (fibers, tubes, rods) and two \n\ndimensions under 100 nm and nanosheets have only one dimension under 100 nm [1]. By \n\nextending the concept of aspect ratio, nanosized materials can also be conveniently \n\n2D Nanotubes \n\n<100 \n\n3D Nanoparticles \n\n<100 \n\n \n<100 \n\n1D Nanosheets \n\n \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n8 \n\n \n\naddressed and classified according with their dimensionality: one-dimensional - 1D \n\n(sheets, thin films), two-dimensional - 2D (tubes, rods and wires \u2013 may be attached on a \n\nsubstrate) or three-dimensional 3D (particles) if one, two or three dimensions are in the \n\nnanometre size, respectively. 2D particles have the largest aspect ratio as opposed to 3D \n\nlike particles [7]. \n\nThere is some controversy regarding this classification (table 2), since the imposed 100 nm \n\nas the upper limit is somewhat arbitrary. This limit is commonly considered to be the one \n\nat which the properties of the particles differ from the properties of the corresponding bulk \n\nmaterials, but there is no scientific solid evidence to support this statement and the change \n\nof properties may occur above this limit [3, 8]. \n\nTable 2.

Most of the definitions also do not take into account nanostructure agglomerations, \n\npartially nanostructured materials and high surface area sub-micrometre particles [8]. \n\nAs some materials may contain or accidently release a small amount of nanoparticles, it is \n\nimportant to correctly classify what can be considered or included in the nanoparticle \n\ndefinition, not only from the legal side but mainly to classify the risk associated with \n\nhandling the materials and adequate the processes and exposure levels for minimizing the \n\nassociated risk [2, 8]. \n\nSeveral attempts to correctly define a nanoparticle have been made throughout the years, \n\ntaking into account agglomerates and suspensions, as well as limiting certain properties (at \n\nleast a specific area \u2018   \u2019 of 60 m\n2\n/g) [8]. There are particles that are sized under 100 nm \n\nthat have a specific surface area under 60 m\n2\n/g which are obviously nanoparticles. \n\nTherefore Kreyling, et al [8] propose limiting the minimum specific surface area per unit \n\nof volume \u2018    \u2019 to 60 m\n2\n/cm\n\n3\n as a way to complement the nanoparticle definitions. \n\nDoing so, these authors consider that it is possible to easily classify nanosized materials, \n\nnanostructured materials, as well as nanodispersions. The VSSA can be calculated by \n\nrelating the \u2018   \u2019 [m\n2\n/g], determined by BET procedure, and the material density \u2018 \u2019 \n\n[g/cm\n3\n] by equation 1 [8]: \n\n                 (equation 1) \n\n \n\nAn uncontrolled nanoparticles release may have a great impact on the environment and on \n\nthe society itself. As most of nanoparticle toxicity studies are focused on the effects and \n\nimpact of accidently discharged and inhaled nanoparticles originated by combustion \n\nprocesses, the effect of engineered nanoparticles remains obscure. As combustion \n\ngenerated nanoparticles are often considered as accounting for several health problems [3], \n\nthe extrapolation that engineered nanoparticles have the same adverse effects cannot be \n\nruled out without further toxicity studies. Considering the possibility of nanoparticle \n\nhazardous impacts it seems mandatory to characterize several nanoparticle parameters such \n\nas [2, 3]: \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n10 \n\n \n\n?

Nanocomposites bioapplications \n\n \n\nThere are several applications benefiting from the combination of polymers and \n\nnanoparticles properties as found in many different areas as tissue engineering, specifically \n\nin nerve guide channels and bone implants, or in other fields as antimicrobial materials. \n\nThe next section will review few representative examples of such applications. \n\n  \n\nB1. Nerve guide channels \n\n \n\nIn the late 80\u2019s tissue engineering research grew exponentially, namely nerve regeneration \n\ntherapy [10]. Current grafting techniques can be summarized as [11]: \n\n? Autografts: the graft is collected from the patient\u2019s body bearing full \n\nbiocompatibility and no immune response. Being, considered as a gold standard its \n\ndrawbacks are related to its limited availability. \n\n \n\n? Allografts: this type of graft is provided by a donor other than the patient and \n\nalthough it has the same capabilities as an autograft, the immune response may be \n\nsuperior, the availability is also low and there is an associated risk of disease \n\ntransmission. \n\n \n\n? Xenografts: for this type of graft the implantation source is other species, and it \n\ncarries itself an increased immune response probability and higher disease \n\ntransmission risk.   \n\nAs each of these approaches poses some risks, particularly the used materials in allograft \n\nor xenograft and the lack of reliable sources, the development of mimetic materials seems \n\nto be a promising approach. In the last decade nerve tissue regeneration strategies have \n\nbeen revised because clinical trials did not confirm the growth factors effects observed in \n\nin vitro studies. Some difficulties emerged also from other issues such as the cellular \n\ncomplexity of the nervous system which requires different approaches for different cell \n\ntypes, or the difficulties of transposing laboratory modelling to the operation site [10]. \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n13 \n\n \n\nEarly attempts of nerve defects repair often resulted in failure. However as micro-surgery \n\nconcept was consolidated, the trials success rate improved allowing the individual \n\nalignment of the nerves and minimizing the tension generated from stretching and suturing \n\nthe two nerve ends directly. For the successful achievement nerve guide channels play an \n\nimportant role. Guide channels are tubes within which the two ends of a damaged nerve are \n\nallowed to grow and attach and thus recover faster. There may exist a lot of materials that \n\ncan be possibly used as guide channels. However some key properties are required such as \n\n[5, 10]: \n\n? To be easily processed for allowing the achievement of the desired diameter and \n\nwall thickness. \n\n? To be of simple implantation through microsurgery. \n\n? To be sterilizable.  \n\n? To be biocompatible and biodegradable. \n\nPermanent inert materials, as opposed to biocompatible and biodegradable materials, can \n\nalso be used in nerve repair strategies, but not only they carry higher risk of infection, they \n\nalso elicit connective tissue responses, can compress nerves or become dislodged [10]. \n\nThe peripheral nerve tissues \u2018PNS\u2019 may spontaneously recover or are easier to be aided in \n\nrecovery (figure 3A). Contrarily central nervous system \u2018CNS\u2019 tissues generally need the \n\naid of guide channels to regenerate, as there are several factors such as inhibitory cues or \n\nabsence of stimulatory cues that prevent spontaneous tissue recovery (figure 3B) [5]. \n\n     \n\nFigure 3. Illustration of the nerve regeneration process: A) spontaneous peripheral nerve \n\nsystem (PNS) recovery. B) Central nervous system (CNS) auto-inhibition, adapted from \n\n[12]. \n\nA B \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n14 \n\n \n\nSynthetic materials are a promising choice to replace the autologous material and its \n\nassociated risks, as it is possible to incorporate several strategies as cell transplants, \n\ntopographic and electrical stimulation. These strategies alo ne have been proved to work \n\nwell but their combined efficiency is not known yet in nerve guide channels, thus requiring \n\nfurther studies to develop and evaluate the next generation of nerve guide channels [5]. \n\n   \n\nB2. Bone implants \n\n \n\nIn our current society bone fractures and several bone diseases, like cancer, osteoporosis, \n\nand osteoarthritis are becoming more and more common, due to the increased human life \n\nexpectancy and to the modern life style. The limited life time of the common implants \n\nresults from several issues like implant loosening, inflammation, infection and debris \n\nrelease, which makes urgent the development of novel materials able of a better bone \n\nbonding with larger life time and bone regeneration abilities [13]. \n\nThese objectives have pushed orthopaedic medicine to study bone tissue regeneration and \n\ngrowth, as osseous defects greatly influence human quality of live and longevity. \n\nBiologically bone tissue is a very dynamic and extremely complex system, with a great \n\nregenerative capacity. Bone tissue is composed of a myriad of interleaved components \n\nwhich give rise to a complex structure. Healthy bone is roughly composed by 70% of a \n\nnanohydroxyapatite mineral phase and by 30% of collagen organic phase. Other elements \n\npresent in smaller quantities include citrate, carbonate, sodium, magnesium, zinc, \n\npotassium and a wide variety of noncollagenic proteins [14]. \n\nThe needs underlying the regeneration of severe bone defects resulting from traumas, \n\ntumours or anomalies require the application of implants or grafting techniques \n\n(autografting, allografting, xenografting). To date the limitations to these techniques come \n\nfrom the unavailability of the biological material, the immunologic adverse responses or \n\nfrom the inadequacy of the synthetic materials [14].  \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n15 \n\n \n\nThere is a need to develop new grafting materials able of mimicking the biological \n\ncomponents ability to [14, 11] induce osteoblasts adhesion and proliferation as well as \n\nvascularisation [15]. \n\n \n\nIt was observed that electric current promotes osteogenesis, and thus it has been \n\nhypothesised that the internal forces induced by an external electric field generate electric \n\nsignals that transport information to bone cells allowing the regulation of their biological \n\nfunctions [15]. Collagen fibers are aligned polar proteins, and thus when deformed they \n\ngenerate an electrical current and vice-versa (piezoelectricity). It has been proposed that \n\npiezoelectricity may have a fundamental role in bone growth, remodelling and \n\nregeneration. Piezoelectric materials with mimetization capabilities are attractive an \n\napproach in skeletal regeneration [16]. \n\n \n\nB3. Inert bioimplants \n\n \n\nSometimes an approach different from that intended to the promotion of cell adhesion and \n\nproliferation may be required. In many devices, like catheters, heart valves or sensors, \n\namong the various failure reasons are the interactions at the body/material interface like the \n\nadhesion and proliferation cells which are not desired at the body/material interface. \n\nCatheters are particularly prone to bacterial film formation and subsequent infection \n\nespecially in a long term usage. This film is formed soon after implantation, a process \n\ncalled surface conditioning, and its composition is manly conditioned by the chemical \n\nnature and the design of the implant. The main problem is that even non-pathogenic \n\nentities may cause infections which require the removal of the implant with its associated \n\nrisks. Therefore the development of new materials able of reducing the bacterial film \n\nformation and the interaction with body fluids is needed in order to improve implant life \n\nand body acceptance [17]. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n16 \n\n \n\n1.2. Zinc oxide \n\n \n\nZinc oxide (ZnO) is a binary semiconductor that in normal pressure and temperature \n\ncondition crystallises preferably in Wurtzite hexagonal structure (figure 4) and appears in \n\nnature as zincite mineral. The hexagonal ZnO belongs to the space group P63mc or C6v\n4\n, \n\npoint group 6 mm or C6v and its typical lattice are [18, 19]: \n\n      \n\n           \n\n           \n\n \nFigure 4. ZnO wurtzite hexagonal structure, adapted from [URL1]. \n\n \n\nEach ion present is tetrahedrically coordinated, meaning that an ion is surrounded by four \n\nions of opposite signal, and the distribution occurs in ab plane intercalated sheets of cations \n\n\u2018Zn\n2+\n\n\u2019 and sheets of anions \u2018O\n2-\n\n\u2019 along the c axis [18, 19]. \n\nThe terminal surfaces of this crystalline structure in the c axis are the (    ) of Zn\n2+\n\n \n\ncations and the (    ) of O\n2- \n\nanions. The strong polarity of these terminations gives rise to \n\nlike piezoelectricity or spontaneous polarization. The chemical bond classification lies \n\nbetween pure covalent and pure ion as in this material exists sp3 bonding as well as a \n\nstrong ion character in the Zn-O bonding [18, 19]. \n\nThe interest in ZnO for optoelectronics application lies in properties such as a wide band \n\ngap (~3,37 eV) or large exciton binding energy (~60 meV). As the work wavelength of \n\nZnO lies between ultraviolet (UV) and blue radiation, ZnO research was electronic \n\nZinc \n\nOxygen \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n17 \n\n \n\noriented and it was based almost solely bulk properties (i.e. crystal growth, doping, band \n\nstructure, lasers or sensors) [18, 19]. \n\n \n\nA. ROS formation \n\n \n\nReactive oxygen species (ROS) can spontaneously form in the nanoparticles surface, more \n\nparticularly in the crystalline defect present in them. Generally they appear by reaction in \n\nthe materials surface of adsorbed oxygen species and electron/hole pairs. The more \n\nelectron/hole pairs exists in the material surface the more ROS are formed. This can be \n\nenhanced by rising the number of interstitial zinc that leading to electron/hole pairs \u2018    ? \u2019 \n\n[20]. \n\nTypically these electronic species can be achieved by irradiating the material with \n\nelectromagnetic radiation, namely UV, promoting valence electrons to the conduction band \n\nleaving behind the corresponding holes. With nanoparticles it is expected that with the \n\nincreased of surface area the site defects (i.e. interstitial Zn) also increase leading to more \n\navailable electronic defects even in the absence of radiation [20].  \n\nEven if the mechanisms of ROS formation are not fully understood several mechanisms \n\nhave been proposed. One of those will be used to illustrate what possibly happens in \n\naqueous solutions (Figure 5) (electronic species    and    are written in Kr\u00f6ger-vink \n\nnotation and radical species are noted with a dot \u2018 \u2019 on the left to avoid misinterpretations) \n\n[20]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.

The \n\nelectronic hole \u2018  \u2019 reacts with one water molecule to form the ion pair \u2018 +    ? \u2019 while \n\nthe free electron \u2018  \u2019 reacts with one oxygen molecule to form the superoxide radical anion \n\n\u2018   \n \n\n\u2019 (1). The \u2018   \n \n\n\u2019 radical may react with the \u2018 +\u2019 ion forming the hydroperoxyl \n\nradical \u2018    \u2019 that may further react with another free electron originating the hydrogen \n\nperoxide anion \u2018   \n \n\n\u2019 (2). The reaction can end if a peroxide molecule \u2018    \u2019 is formed \n\nby the reaction of the \u2018 +\u2019 ions and \u2018   \n \n\n\u2019 (3) [20]. \n\n \n\nB. Bio zinc oxide \n\n \n\nIt is expected that with particle size reduction below the nanometre range, namely sub \n\nmicrometre and nanometre, that the materials properties are greatly enhanced and \n\nimproving and potentiate their applicability in the biomaterials area. In this area the \n\ncytotoxic effects of ZnO nanoparticles are not fully known and therefor it is a major topic \n\nin biomaterials research and investigation [1-4]. \n\nNanoparticles properties can be adverse to biological systems, but several studies shows \n\nthe possibilities of their usefulness to potentiate and valorise those same properties in \n\nbiological applications to improve the humankind quality of life. ZnO appears to have a \n\ngreat potential to be a key item in biomedical applications, namely in controlled drug \n\ndelivery, cellular regeneration or biomarker, and therefor ZnO nanoparticles cytotoxicity \n\nmust be fully evaluated so its effect can be known [4]. \n\nIt is accepted that ZnO cytotoxicity (figure 6) is related to two fundamental factors [4]: \n\n? Surface effects: ROS release form the particles surface that reacts with cellular \n\nwalls and breaks them by means of lipid peroxidation, exposing the cellular \n\nnucleus. ROS can then penetrate the cell and react with nucleic acid and proteins \n\n(i.e. enzyme deactivation). Even cells with great anti-oxidant potential can be \n\nbroken and enter oxidative stress if the natural antioxidants are fully depleted. \n\n \n\n? Mechanical effect: Stress originated from the interface particle/cell and it is related \n\nwith the size and form of the particles. \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n19 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6. The effect of ZnO cytotoxic mechanism in cells [22]. \n\n \n\nB1. Controlled drug delivery systems \n\n \n\nNanoparticles have the advantage of being in the same size order of biomolecules or \n\nbiological structural units, and by so they can dynamically interact with the cellular surface \n\nor interior or penetrate barriers that micrometre particles can\u2019t. This was possible by the \n\nadvances, in recent years, of the comprehension of the human body to the molecular and \n\nnanometric levels but the treatment methods that could benefit from this knowledge didn\u2019t \n\nfollow this lead [23]. \n\nCurrently none or few alternatives exist to chemo/radiotherapy in cancer disease treatment. \n\nBoth treatments are often accompanied by several adverse effects, such as medullar tissue \n\nsuppression, neurotoxicity and poor selectivity, as its administration can hardly be called \n\nCell death \n\nMembrane \n\nrupture \n\nCell \n\nmembrane \n\nROS \n\n \n\n \n\nZnO nanoparticles \n\nHealthy cells \n\nDead cells \n\nHydrophilic \n\nHydrophilic \n\nHydrophobic \n\nHydrophobic \n\nTransport \n\nproteins \n\nTransport \n\nproteins \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n20 \n\n \n\nlocal. Nanotechnology and nanomedicine open new doors in focussed treatment which \n\ncould obviate these troubles as nanoparticles can act as an active principle, drug carrier or \n\nboth [23]. \n\n \n\nB1.1. Selective cytotoxicity \n\n \n\nWhen Cory Hanley, et al [23] investigated the effect of ZnO exposition in cultures \n\nactivated T cells lines it was observed that to a concentration of 10 mM of ZnO activated T \n\ncells were less viable than the non-activated counterparts. Further, in complementary tests \n\nof co-cultures of cancerous cells and healthy cell lines viability of the cancerous ones were \n\nseveral times less than the healthy ones. It is also verified that the cytotoxicity of ZnO \n\nnanoparticles is dose dependant, as with increased dose cytotoxicity of the system \n\nincreases to both types of cells, but there is an evident selectivity of toxic effects to the \n\nunhealthy cell lines. Other tests indicate that ZnO nanoparticles induce cell apoptosis by \n\nmeans of ROS, which leads to say that the toxicity is in fact related to the proliferation rate \n\nof the exposed cells (cancerous replicate extremely fast) [23]. Other authors observed the \n\nsame pattern and behaviour in other systems, namely Mariappan Premanathan, et al [24] in \n\ncultures of leukaemia cells (HL60) and mononuclear blood cells (PBMC), stating that ZnO \n\nnanoparticles exert a strong cytotoxic effect on the leukaemia line, inducing apoptosis \n\nthrough lipid peroxidation [24]. \n\n \n\nB1.2. Synergy action \n\n \n\nPhoto dynamic therapy (PDT) is currently being studied as a mean to obviate cancer\u2019s \n\nnormal treatment methods. If the cells are resistant to chemicals and drugs normal \n\ntreatment methods can be inhibited. The action of a specific wave length radiation on a \n\nphotosensitiser located in specific target sites will promote the release of ROS with \n\ncapability do destroy and avoid the proliferation of malignant cells. [4]. \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n21 \n\n \n\nAs zinc oxide is a known photosensitiser, Dadong Guo, et al [4] studied the synergetic \n\neffect of ZnO NPs loaded with daunorrubicin drug in PDT of leukaemia multiresistant \n\ncancer cell lines. The cytotoxic effect of ZnO NPs was observed on both cell types \n\n(leukaemia and multiresistant counterparts), and the action on both cell lines was the same \n\nat higher concentrations. The effect is enhanced by the radiation as the ROS released from \n\nZnO NPs break the cellular wall resulting in cytoplasm efflux, more drug and ROS cell \n\npenetration which results in cell death [4]. The same phenomenon was observed by \n\nJingyuan Li, et al [25] and Haijun Zhang [21] in other types of cell lines. \n\n \n\nB1.3. Role of particle size \n\n \n\nParticle size may influence the material cytotoxicity, especially in nanometre scale. \n\nDadong Guo, et al [4] observed practically no difference in the toxicity of 20, 60 and 100 \n\nnm particles at the same concentrations in leukaemia normal and multiresistant cell line \n\n[4]. \n\nHowever at concentrations above 25 \u00b5g/ml cell viability greatly decreased on both types of \n\ncultures, but being more pronounced in multiresistant leukaemia cell line [4]. \n\nOn the other hand Shantikumar Nair, et al [26] observed that cytotoxicity had a strong \n\ndependency on the particle size in cultures on cancerous osteoblasts. In their investigations \n\nat low concentrations smaller size particles were more cytotoxic but at higher \n\nconcentration levels the behaviour of those same particles was the same. Particles under \n\n350 nm were more effective at lower concentration than micrometric particles, as the toxic \n\nbehaviour can be seen at 100 \u00b5M and it reaches the maximum at 500 \u00b5M [26].  \n\n \n\nB1.4. Role of particle morphology \n\n \n\nAs the size of particle may influence toxicity of NPs, particle morphology can also \n\ninfluence NPs toxicity. Rizwan Wahab, et al [27] investigated the influence of the \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n22 \n\n \n\nconcentration of several types of nanostructures (NS) in U87 and HeLa cell lines. The NS \n\ninvestigated were microflowers of nanorods (MFR), microflowers of nanosheets (MFS) \n\nand nanoparticles aggregated microspheres (NAM) that were compared to loose \n\nnanoparticles [27]. \n\nThese authors, as the others mentioned above, observed that NP and NS cytotoxicity in \n\nboth cultures rise in a dose dependent way. These authors also observed that NAM and \n\nMFS were more toxic than nanoparticles alone and MFR. According to these authors \n\nnanoparticles morphology can be related to cytotoxicity, but further studies are still needed \n\nin determining the specific effect and mechanisms behind this influence [27]. \n\n  \n\nB1.5. Role of zinc ions \n\n \n\nZinc oxide has low solubility in aqueous medium, but some authors point out the \n\npossibility that the \u2018   +\u2019 ions originated from the nanoparticles dissolution may influence \n\nand actively participate on the cytotoxicity of ZnO nanoparticles [28].  \n\nW. Song, et al [28] show that when Ana-1 cell lines are exposed to NPs concentration \n\nbelow ZnO solubility the cells are more exposed to \u2018   +\u2019 ions and therefor they associate \n\nthe toxicity to this ion. When the cell lines are exposed to NPs concentration above ZnO \n\nsolubility the cation concentration is so low that their contribution practically irrelevant, in \n\nfavour of the effects associated with particle specified above [28]. \n\nOn the other hand P. J. Moos, et al [29] didn\u2019t found any correlation between \u2018   +\u2019 \n\ncation release on the ZnO cytotoxicity in RKO colon cancerous cell lines and affirm that to \n\nthose cells cytotoxicity is due to particle cell contact. \n\nIn agreement with P. J. Moos, et al [29], M. Ahamed, et al [30] also didn\u2019t attributed ZnO \n\nNPs cytotoxicity to the cations released from nanorods in contact with A549 cell lines. It is \n\nhowever observed that the cytotoxic effect of higher concentration of this ion is lower that \n\nthe oxidative stress imposed by the same amount of ZnO nanorods. \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n23 \n\n \n\nB2. Antibacterial/fungi properties \n\n \n\nZnO particles also have antibacterial/fungi properties, as O. Yamamoto [31] finds a string \n\nsize a concentration dependency on antibacterial activity in Escherichia coli (E. Coli) and \n\nStaphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) bacteria cultures. The effect of particle size reduction \n\nfrom 800 to 100 nm was more pronounced in the E. Coli bacteria colony [31]. \n\nThe proposed action mechanisms of antibacterial activity are attributed to [26]: \n\n? ROS release from the particles surface \n\n? Ion release from the particles surface \n\n? Bacteria cell membrane rupture \n\n? Internalization of the particles \n\nAs a photo-active material, ZnO antibacterial studies often rely on UV radiation of the \n\nmaterial, which shows the importance the ROS released on the fotocatalitic activity of the \n\nmaterial. On the other hand there are some reports that even without the UV radiation this \n\nmaterial presents inhibitory properties relatedly to E. Coli bacteria [26, 32].  \n\nTaking into account another route, S. Nair, et al [26] discuss the effect of surfactant agents \n\non the antibacterial properties of NPs, as diethyleneglycol surfactant for example can \n\ndamage gram-positive S. Aureus bacteria\u2019s membranes undermining the evaluation of the \n\neffect of NPs themselves. It is quite relevant to determine if the surfactant has any effect on \n\nthese properties as it may unintentionally come from the NPs production stage. There are \n\nstudies that indicate that polyethyleneglycol acts as free radical trap site obstructing their \n\naction on bacteria\u2019s membranes leading to antibacterial activities in the interaction \n\nparticle/membrane. On this account there is an increased effect on gram-negative E. Coli \n\nthan in gram-positive S. Aureus, possibly attributed to the thicker membrane which resists \n\nmore effectively to the mechanical action of ZnO NPs [26].  \n\nConversely M. Premanathan, et al [24] observed a stronger effect on the gram-positive S. \n\naureus, when they studied the antibacterial activity in E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. \n\nAeruginosa) e S. aureus strains, possibly to the inexistence of surfactant agents which \n\nallows the action of other mechanisms besides the mechanical action [24]. \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n24 \n\n \n\nB3. Bone tissue regeneration \n\n \n\nIn search of new biomimetic materials it was found that the \u2018   +\u2019 ion besides being \n\nosteoconductive stimulates also osteogenesis [33]. Zinc is also a trace element in bone \n\nstructure, and is often associated with bone development, as it intervenes in the \n\ncalcification mechanism, participates in numerous biological phenomena, and zinc \n\ndeficiency promotes late bone growth [34]. ZnO nanoparticles appear as a biomimetic \n\nparticle that could supply the bone surround with \u2018   +\u2019 ions and induce osteoconduction \n\nby its piezoelectric properties.  \n\nJ. K. Park, et al [35] observed the growth and osseointegration of MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts \n\ncell line in ZnO nanoflowers deposited in silicon substrates. These authors observed a \n\nrapid proliferation of the osteoblasts throughout the ZnO nanostructures potentiated by the \n\nsamples roughness. In vivo evidence shows that it possible to integrate this material in live \n\nbone matrix and that ZnO may have an active role in adhesion, proliferation and growth \n\nbone matrix [35]. \n\n \n\nB4. Nerve guide channels \n\n \n\nBiomimetic materials capable of better interactions with the body are needed to improve \n\ncurrent guide channel implants, and by so the approach of multi-stimuli is being \n\ninvestigated [12]. This way nanoZnO polymer composites can be engineered into scaffolds \n\nthat mimic the natural neural support tissue with the possibilit y of electrical charge neuron \n\nregeneration aid. ZnO nanoparticles natural antibacterial properties may reduce infection \n\nrisks associated with the implantation of the device. J. T. Seil and T. J. Webster (2008) \n\nhave studied a polyurethane/ZnO nanocomposite for as nerve guide channel in CNS \n\nrecovery. These composites not only possess two of the mentioned strategies they also \n\nhave the characteristic of decreasing astroglial cell adhesion and proliferation, the cells that \n\ncreate the most prominent factor that alts the CNS regeneration, the glial scar [5]. \n\n \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n25 \n\n \n\n1.3. Polyurethane \n\n \n\nPolyurethanes (PUs) are a vast family of synthetic polymers of complex chemical structure \n\nwhen compared with simpler polymers, such as polyethylene or polypropylene. The \n\ncomplex structure is formed when three distinct monomers are combined through specific \n\nchemical reactions originating the polymer chains. The monomers, diisocyanate, \n\nmacroglycol and chain extender, can react and organize in multiple ways, giving rise to an \n\ninfinity of materials with distinct mechanic and physico-chemical properties. The \n\nversatility of these materials arises from the fact that it is possible to alter its chemistry \n\ndepending on the needed application. The changes can be carried out by altering either the \n\nraw materials or the processing conditions [36]. \n\nPUs were first synthesized in 1937 by Otto Bayer and coworkers and till today have been \n\ntypically applied as elastomers, foams, adhesives and paints. Besides the named \n\napplications, polyurethanes found niche market as a biomaterial as they possess unique \n\nmechanical properties, especially fatigue resistance. The biological response and bio-\n\nstability of these materials is conditioned by the surface properties, and those are greatly \n\ninfluenced by the chemistry and synthesis procedure, as both variables influence the \n\ncomposition and distribution of the carbonated chains through the material [36]. \n\n \n\nA. Polyurethane\u2019s chemical structure \n\n \n\nThe combinations of the diisocyanate, polyol and chain extender originate two different \n\nmicro-domains that typically characterise a PU. One is a hard segment originated by the \n\nreaction of diisocyanate and chain extender and the other is a soft segment originated by \n\nthe oligomer polyol. Typical polyurethanes can be represented by [37]: \n\n  ( (  )   )  \n\nWere \u2018 \u2019 is the polyol, \u2018 \u2019 the diisocyanate and \u2018 \u2019 the chain extender. As these three \n\nelements can be differently combined, the PUs properties will depend of the hard/soft \n\nsegment ratio and the monomers nature [37]. \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n26 \n\n \n\nA1. Diisocyanate \n\n \n\nThe diisocyanate is a chemical compound of low molecular weight with two isocyanate \n\nterminal groups. The isocyanate terminations allow this monomer to chemical bond to a \n\npolyol or chain extender forming linear chains, or ramifications if more isocyanate groups \n\nare added, either aliphatic or aromatic. From the industrial or biomedical point of view \n\ndiphenylmethane-diisocyanate (MDI) (4), hydrogenated diphenylmethane-diisocyanate \n\n(HMDI) (5) and toluene diisocyanate (TDI) (6) are the most important ones.  \n\n \n\n    (    )      (    )            (4) \n\n \n\n    (     )      (     )           (5) \n\n \n\n    (    )  (   )    (NCO bonded to carbons 2,4 or 2,6)   (6) \n\n \n \n\nPolyurethane synthesis works by either reactions of urethanes links formation, as an \n\nisocyanate terminal group reacts with hydroxyl groups (polyol or chain extender (7), or by \n\nurea links formation if a diamine is used as chain extender (8) [36]. \n\n                                                                       \n \n \n\n \n\n       +                                (7) \n\n                                                                    \n  \n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                            \n \n \n              \n\n \n \n\n \n\n       +                                 (8) \n\n                                                                \n  \n   \n\n      \n\n \n\nIsocyanate groups are so reactive that they easily react with hydrogen in acid medium and \n\ncan originate either a foam or high urea content, and so reactions with water (9) should be \n\navoided as they will lead to by-products formation, not always desired [36]. \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n27 \n\n \n\n                                                    \n \n \n\n \n\n       +          ?                 ?         +        (9) \n\n                                                            \n  \n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe near perfect packing of the ring structures [ (    )   or  (     )  ] present in the \n\ndiisocyanate and the strong intermolecular interactions, namely hydrogen and urethane \n\ngroups bonding, give rise to rigid microdomains in opposition to the polyol part. The \n\nsegregation of the hard segment segregation from the bulk is dependent on the type of \n\nmonomer used, and determines the microdomains formation, crystallinity and the \n\nmechanical properties of the compound. Chain packing is also influenced by the size, \n\nsymmetry and ring rotation, in a way that compact, rigid and symmetrical  diisocyanate \n\nmolecules leads to better packing than asymmetric and flexible ones, and by so increases \n\nthe mechanical properties. The bulk properties also depend on the type of ring presented by \n\nthe diisocyanate. The rigidity of the molecule is higher in the presence of an aromatic ring \n\nas the   electrons delocalization through the ring does not allow boat/chair conformations \n\nmaking the molecule stiffer [36]. \n\n \n\nA2. Polyols \n\n \n\nThe polyol monomer is the polyurethane chain soft segment former. Polyols are oligomer \n\nmacromolecules with hydroxyl terminal groups and have repeating units based on \n\npolyether or polyester, (10) and (11) respectively [36]: \n\n                        (10) \n\n                       (11) \n\n             \n  \n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn which \u2018  \u2019 is the hydroxyl group, \u2018 \u2019 e \u2018  \u2019 are carbonated chains, \u2018 \u2019 is oxygen and \n\n\u2018 \u2019 and \u2018 \u2019the number of monomers.

Branched or reticulated structures \n\nare obtained by the use of more hydroxyl groups per molecule. [36]. \n\nTypical polyol macromolecules are polytetramethylene ether glycol (PTMO, PTMEG or \n\nPTMG) (12), polypropylene glycol (PPG) (13), polyethylene adipate (PA) (14) and \n\npoly(1,6-hexyl 1,2 ethyl carbonate)diol (PHECD) (15). \n\n \n\n    (   )                (12) \n\n \n\n                        (13) \n\n                    \n \n\n        \n \n\n \n\n \n\n    (   )      (   )        (   )        (14) \n\n                                     \n   \n    \n\n                       \n  \n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n    (   )        (   )          (   )       (15) \n\n                                      \n  \n   \n\n                                       \n  \n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChain packing of polyols also influences the mechanical properties of the polymer, and it \n\nis achieved by structural regularity and symmetry of the molecule [36]. \n\nChemical or hydrolytic degradations are extremely influenced by the polyol choice. \n\nPolyester-urethanes hydrogen bonding through ester groups enhances the mechanical \n\nproperties of the bulk at the expense of an increase in hydrolytic degradation susceptibility. \n\nThe alternative, polyether-urethanes, are highly chemical resistant with oxygen bond \n\ncleavage occurring in acidic medium, which prevents hydrolytic degradations, but instead \n\nthey oxidize in contact with air [38] with release of peroxides and impoverishment of \n\nmechanical performance [36]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n29 \n\n \n\nA3. Chain extender \n\n \n\nThe chain extender is a hydroxyl or amino terminated small molecule that plays a key role \n\nin the mechanical properties of the PUs. The direct reaction of polyols and diisocyanates \n\noften results in soft rubber. When the chain extender molecules react with the \n\ndiisocyanates ones they form a hard segment that segregates from the bulk, which acts as \n\nboth a filler and reticulation spot increasing  the overall mechanical properties. \n\nPolyurethane or polyurethane-urea can be achieved by using either dyols or diamines \n\nrespectively, typically 1,4-buthanediol (BD) (16) or ethylenediamine (ED) (17) [36]. \n\n   (   )             (16) \n\n  \n\n                                    \n\n    (   )                                             (17) \n \n\n \n\nThe mechanical resistance of the polyurethanes is influenced by the type of chain extender \n\nmolecules that act in the same way as the polyol. Another key aspect is the monomer \n\nconcentration, as a large concentration originates a large quantity of hard segments by \n\ndiisocyanate reaction and microdomain segregation, leading to harder, stiffer and more \n\nresistant polyurethanes [36]. \n\n \n\nB. Thermal history \n\n \n\nHard and soft micro-domain distribution depends not only on composition but also on the \n\nthermal history of the polyurethane. PUs based in MDI/BD, for example, form semi-\n\ncrystalline compact domains during annealing, but a change in micromorphology may \n\noccur if stretching is also applied. As the micro-domains take an elongated shape, the \n\nmelting point of the bulk material also changed to lower values. Polymorphs can also form \n\nduring the material processing which may impact the final properties of the material. The \n\nmechanical and thermal properties of a PU may be highly affected by the bulk thermal \n\nhistory [36]. \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n30 \n\n \n\nC. Polyurethanes bioaplications \n\n \n\nThe selection of a biomaterial should be made by finding a material which suits the \n\napplication, taking into account that their characteristics and behaviour should be as \n\nproximate as possible to the chosen substitution part. The bio-stability and biological \n\nresponse characteristics, often determined by surface properties, are the decisive criteria \n\nwhen choosing a biomaterial. In this way mechanical properties are often disregarded as it \n\nis difficult to balance them with the host response and the high clinic requisites [36]. \n\nPolyurethanes are regarded as heterogeneous materials because of the two dist inct micro-\n\nphases segregation that occurs in the bulk. The hard/soft segment segregation appears due \n\nto the nature of the antagonistic interactions between the polar urethane and the non-polar \n\npolyol segments. The segregation may preferably take place in certain locations depending \n\non the interface polymer surface/surrounding environment. In this way when the polymer \n\nis surrounded by hydrophobic medium, such as air, the non-polar soft segment rises to the \n\nsurface. Contrarily if surrounded by biological fluids (hydrophilic) the hard segments are \n\nthe ones that segregate in the bulk surface. This indicates that the surrounding environment \n\nchanges the surface characteristics of bulk polyurethanes and by doing so it also changes \n\nits biological response [36]. \n\nBiocompatibility of PUs has been reported in several studies. B. Saad, et al [39] produced \n\nPU formulations that didn\u2019t induce cytotoxicity and were able to promote the adhesion, \n\ngrowth and activity of fibroblasts (3T3 cell line) demonstrating the usefulness of PU in \n\nbone implant fixation. \n\nBesides bone implants [40], polyurethanes are widely used as inert materials in many \n\nbiomedical devices, such as heart valves [41] or catheters.  \n\nControlled drug delivery systems (CDDS) may be achieved by (bio)degradable \n\npolyurethanes. E. Jabbari and M. Khakpour [42] have shown that polyurethane \n\nmicrospheres can effectively be used in CDDS, and also proved that changes in chain \n\nextender concentration can drastically alter the polymer matrix porosity, a relevant \n\nparameter in engineered biomaterials. The authors showed that till 50% molar of chain \n\nextender there was a reduction in the pore size from 950 to 600 nm as the chains lose their \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n31 \n\n \n\nmobility. For higher concentrations, namely 60 and 67%, the chains became stiffer and \n\nporosity formation was inhibited [42]. \n\nThe use of biodegradable polyurethanes instead of an inert matrix can be very interesting \n\nin delivery systems as they convert themselves into simpler organic products that can be \n\nmineralized and redistributed through biological cycles (carbon, nitrogen and sulphur) \n\n[43]. A challenging proposal by W. N. Sivak, et al [44] suggests that instead of loading the \n\ndrugs (one or more) in the matrix, they could be chemically bonded to carbonated chains of \n\na biodegradable PU. The authors stress that the implantation of such a device will \n\ngradually degrade along time releasing the drugs in a much more controlled way [44]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n32 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter II \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n \n\n \n\n35 \n\n \n\n2.

Techniques description \n\n \n\nA. X-ray diffraction \u2013 XRD \n\n \n\nThe X-ray diffraction is a powerful technique that allows the identification of the \n\ncrystalline phases of a crystalline material. This technique s is based on the constructive \n\nphenomenon of diffracted radiation by verifying the Bragg law [49, 50]: \n\n                     (equation 2) \n\n \n\nWhere \u2018  \u2019 is the constructive phase difference, \u2018    \u2019 is distance between two parallel \n\nplanes and \u2018 \u2019 the reflection angle between a crystallographic plane and the incident \n\nradiation with content wavelength \u2018 \u2019 [49]: \n\nFor each of hkl planes present in the material a characteristic peak appears in the \n\ndifractogram that can be identified by comparison with datasheets of well identified \n\nmaterials [49]. \n\nThe crystallite size \u2018 \u2019 may be estimated from a difractogram by following the Debye-\n\nScherrer equation [51]: \n\n  \n  \n\n     \n         (equation 3) \n\n \n\nWhere \u2018 \u2019 is a form factor (0.89 to spherical surfaces), \u2018 \u2019 the X-ray wavelength (typically \n\n1,54056  ?), \u2018 \u2019 the width at half height of the peak (in radians) at \u2018 \u2019 degrees (radians) \n\nwere the diffraction occurred. \n\n\u2018 \u2019 can be established by relating the half height of the sample and pattern, \u2018       \u2019 and \n\n\u2018       \u2019 respectively, for the same diffraction angle following the equation: \n\n          \n \n        \n\n \n       (equation 4) \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n \n\n \n\n44 \n\n \n\nB. N2 Isotherm analysis \n\n \n\nIsotherm is the relation at constant temperature of the gas quantity adsorbed at the surface \n\nof a material and the partial pressure at which it occurs. According to Braunauer, Emmet \n\nand Teller (BET), four basic steps can describe the gas adsorption on a material surface \n\n(figure 10) [52- 54]. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 10. Four steps in BET gas adsorption theory: initial adsorption process, monolayer \n\nformation, multilayer formation and pores filling [54]. \n\n \n\nOn the first stage (1) the gas molecules adsorb at material surface through Van der Waals \n\nforces. With the raise of pressure more gas molecules adsorb till a complete monolayer is \n\nformed (stage 2) and with further pressure increase new gas adsorbed layers are formed \n\n(stage 3 and 4). This simplistic model can\u2019t fully describe isotherms other than the \n\nInternational Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) type II isotherms, as other \n\nphenomena, such as capillary condensation within mesopores, may give rise to other \n\nbehaviours and consequentially to other isotherms [52]. \n\n \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n \n\n \n\n45 \n\n \n\nCapillary condensation is a phenomenon that occurs after the multilayer formation in \n\nwhich the gas further adsorbed condenses in the remaining pore volume. The liquid phase \n\nformed is separated by gaseous phase through a meniscus [52]. \n\nThe IUPAC defines a pore as a cavity in which its depth is larger than its length.   \n\nAccording to IUPAC pores are classified in function of the diameter \u2018  \u2019 [52]: \n\n?

Type I: This isotherm is also known as Langmuir isotherm. This behaviour is found \n\nin microporous solids with low external surface area (activated carbon or zeolites). \n\nAs the curve rises with increasing partial pressure it reaches a plateau near the end \n\nlimited by micropore volume. \n\n \n\n? Type II: This isotherm is rather common to nonporous or macroporous solids and is \n\nassociated to a monolayer formation (point B) and multilayer adsorption without \n\nrestriction. \n\n \n\n? Type III: Type III isotherms are rare cases and generally do not have the B point. \n\nSome cases however present an undefined B point and in those cases the \n\ninteractions adsorbate-adsorbate are more relevant than the adsorbate-adsorbent. \n\n \n\n? Type IV: Like type II this isotherm is characterized by multilayer formation and has \n\na hysteresis loop cycle resulting from capillary condensation within mesopores. \n\n \n\n? Type V: Type V isotherm is also characterized by a hysteresis loop cycle, but \n\ninstead of a multilayer formation it follows type III tendency in which the \n\ninteraction of adsorbate-adsorbent are rather weak. \n\n \n\n? Type VI: This isotherm generally represents a step multilayer adsorption on \n\nnonporous uniform surfaces and each step is related to one layer formed.  \n\nIsotherms IV and V hysteresis loops can exhibit four different patterns (H1 to H4 \u2013 see \n\nfigure 12) normally associated to capillary condensation in mesopores with different \n\ngeometry [52]: \n\n? Type H1: Related to agglomerates of spherical particles with narrow pore size \n\ndistributions. \n\n \n\n?

Type H3: This loop pattern is exhibited by platelet aggregates with slit shaped \n\npores. \n\n \n\n?

BET specific surface area \n\n \n\nAccording to Braunauer, Emmet and Teller (BET) methodology, the specific surface area \n\n(SSA) may be determined from the linear part of the adsorption isotherm in the partial \n\npressure range 0.05 to 0.30 through the BET equation (equation 5) [53]: \n\n \n\n  \n\n (  \n \n\n  \n)\n \n\n   \n\n   \n \n\n \n\n  \n+\n\n \n\n   \n       (equation 5) \n\nIn which \u2018\n \n\n  \n\u2019 is the gas partial pressure, \u2018 \u2019 is the amount of adsorbed gas, \u2018  \u2019 the \n\nmonolayer capacity and \u2018 \u2019 is a constant related to the energy of monolayer formation \u00e9 \n\n[53]. \n\nAfter the determination of \u2018  \u2019 from the BET equation the SSA may be calculated by the \n\nequation: \n\n    \n        \n\n \n         (equation 6) \n\nIn which \u2018 \u2019 is the sample mass, \u2018  \u2019 is the Avogadro constant and \u2018  \u2019 is the area \n\noccupied by one molecule of adsorbate in the complete monolayer. Considering that the \n\nadsorbed N2 gas gives rise to a compact monolayer formation \u2018  \u2019 equals 0,162 nm\n2\n [53]. \n\nTo be noted that in type II and IV isotherms associated to large mesopores the BET \n\nequation linearity is verified between 0.05 &lt;\n \n\n  \n &lt;0.35.

Scanning electron microscopy \u2013 SEM \n\n \n\nThe scanning electron microscopy is an observation technique that with its high spatial and \n\nfocus depth, nanometre range resolution and a heavy magnification capacity enables the \n\nobservation the morphology and topography of a material\u2019s surface [50, 49]. \n\nThe basic work principle lies in the bombardment of a materials surface with an electron \n\nbeam from which results the emission of electrons or photons from the surface that after \n\nbeing detected and conveniently treated give life to the surface image topography [50]. \n\nSamples for SEM can have any form but the sample setup should have the minimum \n\noperation to preserve surface characteristics. Normally a conductive thin coat is sputtered \n\non the materials surface to ensure conductivity. Thicker coatings may lead to undesired \n\nartefacts crystallization or rupture and distortion of the original surface [49]. \n\nFrom the many interactions of the materials surface and the electron beam, the decay of \n\nexcited electrons from high energy levels with liberation of characteristic X-rays may \n\noccur. If the intensity of this X-ray is detected and plotted against the energy it is possible \n\nto identify the element that is the origin of the X-ray, as each element releases its own \n\nspecific X-ray that carries a specific energy.

Attenuated total reflectance Fourrier transform infrared spectroscopy: ATR-\n\nFTIR \n\n \n\nFourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) is a spectroscopic method used to gain information \n\nabout the chemical bonding in a material, and so it is very useful to study a chemical bond \n\nof interest rather than being a generic probe. This technique studies the changes of \n\nintensity of an IR beam as a function of its wavelength (200 to 4000 cm\n-1\n\n) when it interacts \n\nwith the sample, and each intensity peak can be related to a specific known chemical bond. \n\nIf a sample is opaque the use of attenuated total reflection (ATR) crystal may be employed, \n\nand thus exploit the reflection of the beam as it propagates throughout the sample and \n\ncrystal enhancing the signal [50]. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n \n\n \n\n52 \n\n \n\nF. Bioactivity assay \n\n \n\nIt is generally accepted that the formation of bonelike apatite on the surface of a material is \n\na requirement to improve the bone bonding capability of the material, as long as it does not \n\ninduce cytotoxicity to the cells. Kokubo et al [47] found that this in vivo behaviour can be \n\nreproduced and predicted in vitro with simulated body fluid (SBF) with ion concentration \n\nnear to that of human blood plasma (HBP). The SBF assay is relatively accurate in \n\ndefining the bioactivity (bone bonding capability) of a material. In some cases no apatite \n\nmaterials can bond to human bone and in others apatite materials do not do so. The reason \n\nthis occurs is manly related to antibody foreign reaction that prevents the bonding [47]. \n\nBecause the original SBF solution (table 8) did not contain the correct amount of SO4\n2+\n\n, a \n\nmodified SBF solution was proposed to obviate this problem. The modified SBF Cl\n-\n and \n\nHCO3\n-\n ion content differ from those in HBP, the stability and reproducibility of the results \n\nis no different from the new formulations that more accurately reproduce HBP. It should \n\nbe mentioned that modified SBF it\u2019s easier to prepare that the new formulations [47]. \n\n \n\nTable 8.

The \n\ndetected aluminium and carbon are attributed to the used aluminium sample holder and \n\ndeposited carbon on the samples for SEM observation, respectively, indicating absence of \n\npowder contamination. \n\n \n\nFigure 14.

The average crystallite sizes stated above are in \n\naccording to the corresponding SEM images, as the thicker structures have a larger \n\ncrystallite size. \n\n      \n\nFigure 17. A) and B): SEM images of precipitated rZnO powder particles at different \n\nmagnifications. \n\nThe morphology differences exhibited by the precipitated particles reflect the differences \n\namong their synthesis conditions.  In the case of rZnO particles, the used ethanol was \n\nadded to Zn\n2+ \n\nsolution prior to the start of precipitation. Ethanol thus could act not only as \n\nsurfactant but also as a modifier of the precipitation medium chemical composition. It is \n\nhere suggested that ethanol might have decrease ZnO solubility in the ethanolic \n\nprecipitation medium thus contributing to enhance supersaturation and thereby favour the \n\nZnO nucleation rate. Favouring the nucleation rate, ethanol would contribute to the genesis \n\nof a large number of nuclei which would grow to a less extent as compared to the smaller \n\nnumber of nuclei formed in the other different conditions which would be allowed to grow \n\nmore. In the case of mZnO powders which also grow in etaholic medium, nucleation was \n\ndifferently affected by ethanol as ethanol was added during precipitation, thus implying a \n\nlow concentration of ethanol at the early stage of nucleation. \n\nThese results thus suggest that ethanol concentration in the precipiating medium is a \n\ncritical condition impacting strongly the nucleation rate of ZnO particles.

Porosity and specific surface area \n\n \n\nThe isotherm adsorption/desorption branches and the corresponding pore size distributions \n\n(insets) respecting  cZnO, pZnO, mZnO and rZnO are represented in figure 18, 19, 20 and \n\n21 respectively. \n\ncZnO isotherm (figure 18) is very close to a IUPAC type II isotherm [52] which is a \n\ncharacteristic isotherm of non-porous or macroporous materials. Although a pore size \n\ndistribution has been determined with an average pore size of 7 nm (table 9), the pore \n\nvolume is rather small as compared to pore volume of the remaining powders and thus the \n\nmesopores exist in a small amount. Micropores were not found in this material. On the \n\nother hand pZnO, mZnO and rZnO powders present type IV isotherms [52] (figures 19, 20 \n\nand 21 respectively) which are characteristic of mesoporous materials displaying mesopore \n\ncapillary condensation. Furthermore both pZnO and mZnO present type H3 hysteresis loop \n\nbranches which are indicative of a platelet aggregates with slit like pores [52]. This \n\nindication is in line with the powders morphology revealed by SEM, particularly in the \n\ncase of mZnO which exhibits slit like pores between its nanometric sized platelets. The \n\naverage pore sizes of pZnO and mZnO were determined as 14 and 12 nm respectively \n\n(table 9). Concerning rZnO nanopowder, it exhibits an H4 type hysteresis loop [52] which \n\nis normally associated to very small slit like pores; in this case the average pore size was \n\ndetermined as 7 nm, which is indeed a lower value than the previous ones. It is necessary \n\nto keep in mind that the BJH procedure of pore size and the pore size distribution \n\ncalculation may underestimate the pore size as it assumes that all pores are cylindrical in \n\nshape. \n\n \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n \n\n \n\n62 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 18. cZnO powder adsorption/desorption type II isotherm and pore size distribution \n\n(inset). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 19. pZnO powder adsorption/desorption type IV isotherm, H3 hysteresis loop and \n\npore size distribution (inset). \n\n \n\n0\n\n0,2\n\n0,4\n\n0,6\n\n0,8\n\n1\n\n0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1\n\nA\nd\n\nso\nrb\n\ne\nd\n\n q\nu\n\na\nn\n\nti\nty\n\n [\nm\n\nm\no\n\nl/\ng\n\n] \n\np/p\u00b0 \n\nAdsoption\n\nDesoption\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1\n\nA\nd\n\nso\nrb\n\ne\nd\n\n q\nu\n\na\nn\n\nti\nty\n\n [\nm\n\nm\no\n\nl/\ng\n\n] \n\np/p\u00b0 \n\nAdsorption\n\nDesoption\n\n \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n \n\n \n\n63 \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 20. mZnO powder adsorption/desorption type IV isotherm, H3 hysteresis loop and \n\npore size distribution (inset). \n\n \n\nFigure 21. rZnO powder adsorption/desorption type IV isotherm, H4 hysteresis loop pore \n\nsize distribution (inset). \n\n0\n\n0,5\n\n1\n\n1,5\n\n2\n\n2,5\n\n3\n\n3,5\n\n0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1\n\nA\nd\n\nso\nrb\n\ne\nd\n\n q\nu\n\na\nn\n\nti\nty\n\n [\nm\n\nm\no\n\nl/\ng\n\n] \n\np/p\u00b0 \n\nAdsorption\n\nDesorption\n\n0\n\n0,5\n\n1\n\n1,5\n\n2\n\n2,5\n\n0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1\n\nA\nd\n\nso\nrb\n\ne\nd\n\n q\nu\n\na\nn\n\nti\nty\n\n [\nm\n\nm\no\n\nl/\ng\n\n] \n\np/p\u00b0 \n\nadsorption\n\nDesorption\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n \n\n \n\n64 \n\n \n\nThe specific surface areas (SSA) (table 9) determined according to BET equation were 15, \n\n29, 45 and 21 m\n2\n/g for cZnO, pZnO, rZnO and mZnO respectively. As expected the rZnO \n\nexhibited the highest surface area because of its nanometric particle size and of its \n\nmesopore walls contribution. Contrarily cZnO being a very aggregated and almost pore \n\ndevoid powder, it exhibits the lowest surface area. The surface areas of pZnO and mZnO \n\nare in a range between cZnO and rZnO values. The pZnO and mZnO powders have similar \n\nmorphology and very similar SSA values as well. The main difference between these two \n\npowders is due to the thicker plate of mZnO which originate a more clustered and dense \n\nnanoflower like structure as compared to pZnO. The more open structure of pZnO also \n\nexplains its larger pore volume as determined by BJH procedure. The precipitated ZnO \n\nparticles have thus larger specific surface area and larger pore volume than the commercial \n\nZnO nanoparticles.  \n\nThe cumulative surface area of the powders cZnO, pZnO, rZnO and mZnO, determined by \n\nBJH procedure, are respectively 17, 41, 62 and 31 m\n2\n/g (table 9). As these values are \n\nsuperior to the corresponding BET based values (15, 29, 45 and 21 m\n2\n/g, respectively), it is \n\nindicative of the existence of bottle shaped pores that favours small diameters, for a given \n\nvolume of absorbed gas, thus  leading to an overestimation of the surface area [55]. \n\nTaking into account the BET surface areas and assuming the powders to be spherically \n\nshaped, the equivalent sphere diameter (ESD) was calculated as 71, 37, 24 and 51 nm for. \n\ncZnO, pZnO, rZnO and mZnO, respectively. This result means that despite their particle \n\nsize exceeds 100nm which is considered to be the limit dimension for \u201cnano\u201d classification \n\n[8], their surface area is equivalent to that of a spherical particle under 71 nm, and as such \n\ntheir particle should be considered as a nanoparticle or nanostructured particle. \n\nFurthermore the fact that all the surface areas per unit of volume (m\n2\n/cm\n\n3\n) are 84, 161, 252 \n\nand 118 m\n2\n/cm\n\n3\n for cZnO, pZnO, rZnO and mZnO respectively, staying above 60 m\n\n2\n/cm\n\n3\n \n\nwhich is lower limit for \u201cnano\u201d classification [8], corroborates the adequateness of the \n\n\u201cnano\u201d label for the powders synthesized in the present work. \n\nThe particles characteristics are summarized in table 9 and their relevance will be \n\naddressed in the coming sections. \n\n \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n \n\n \n\n65 \n\n \n\nTable 9.

Polyurethane characterization \n\n  \n\nThe importance of the characterization of one material is extremely important in the \n\nbiomedical area. It is relevant to understand the material and its reaction with the human \n\nbody as it could lead to a cascade of events with arising problems if the inserted material is \n\nnot known. Therefor even if the material is FDA approved, such as tecoflex SG80A \n\npolyurethane, the evaluation of its structure and properties is still needed, as a way to \n\npredict and understand its behaviour in vitro and in vivo. \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n \n\n \n\n66 \n\n \n\nA.

The peak corresponding to free N-H \n\ncould not be identified (around 3445 cm\n-1\n\n \u2013 table 10) in the present analysis thus indicating \n\nthat practically all the NH groups are bonded and actively reinforcing the bulk.

On figure 23 the DSC curves of tecoflex SG80A \n\nare presented as run1, run2 and cast. The cast curve refers to the polyurethane film that was \n\nafter solvent evaporation at 37 \u00b0C without any subsequent thermal treatment. Run1 refers \n\nto the same polymer but submitted to a drying step at 70 \u00b0C after casting in order to release \n\nthe moieties that might have been present.Run2 refers to the same sample used in run1 \n\nwhich further was subjected to the same assay as a way to clear undesired peaks and reveal \n\nmore accurately the PU behaviour. Typically polyurethanes have at least one glass \n\ntransition temperature originated by the soft segments mobility increase, one crystallization \n\ntemperature associated to the hard segments ordering and a melt temperature at which the \n\npolymer is in a viscous state. The common features to all the samples are the glass \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n \n\n \n\n68 \n\n \n\ntransition temperature Tg under 0 \u00b0C, given by the endothermic inflection point, the \n\ncrystallization temperatures, revealed by the exothermic transformations above 60 \u00b0C and a \n\nmelt temperature above 140 \u00b0C, given by the endothermic transformations. \n\n \n\nFigure 23.

At 95 \u00baC \n\nand 112 \u00b0C the exothermal peaks are attributed to the crystallization temperatures reactions \n\noccur with the softening of the hard segments [37]. Both peaks may correspond to two \n\ndifferent packings associated to hard chain segments with different lengths. The meltdown \n\nof the polymeric mass occurs at 170 \u00b0C. After drying the polymer at 70 \u00b0C (run1), the DSC \n\ncurve changes as the glass transition temperature (Tg), the crystallization and melt \n\ntemperatures are now detected at different values as compared to the cast sample.

The increase of Tg to about -\n\n4 \u00b0C may be viewed as a consequence of a better packing of the macromolecular soft \n\nsegments enabled by the referred solvent degasification. As the solvents affected \n\nnegatively the soft segment packing they were helping the hard segment packing. As this \n\nhelpful contribution for packing consistency is lost, crystallization occurs sooner, at about \n\n66 and 84 \u00b0C, and meltdown occurs in a broader temperature range, from 137 \u00b0C to about \n\n190 \u00b0C. The second run of the same polymer denounces a more refined structure. Tg does \n\nnot change too much as it appear at ~ -3 \u00b0C, indicating that the soft segments could not \n\nimprove further their packing, but the effective changes in crystallization and melt \n\ntemperatures (71, 82 and 140 \u00b0C respectively) point to a better packing of the hard \n\nsegments [60]. \n\n \n\n3.3.

The 2%wt composites FTIR spectra show almost \n\nno difference relative to the pure PU spectra, indicating no new covalent bonding between \n\nPU and ZnO particles. It was reported elsewhere [61] that in polyurethanes membranes \n\nfilled with nanosized ZnO there is a new peak at 1619 cm\n-1\n\n with the attenuation of the \n\n1687 cm\n-1\n\n. In 2%wt composites a new peak at 1614 cm\n-1\n\n was found confirming the binding \n\nof ZnO to the polymer but no attenuation was detected. Also the change in peak at 3294 \n\ncm\n-1\n\n due to H-bounded NH stretching indicates that ZnO particles may be bonded to it, \n\nthus acting in the reinforcement of the polymer matrix.  \n\nThe 50%wt composites were so heavily loaded with ZnO particles that the spectra were \n\ncompletely deformed when compared to pure PU.

Differential scan calorimetry: DSC \n\n \n\nThe effects of pZnO content on the PU matrix can be observed on figure 26. Two major \n\nchanges occur, namely in the glass transition temperature and in the crystallization \n\ntemperatures. With 2%wt ZnO particles the glass transition temperature diminishes from -3 \n\n\u00b0C to -13 \u00b0C and crystallization temperatures increases from 71 and 82 \u00b0C to, respectively,  \n\n77 and 93 \u00b0C. The presence of ZnO polar particles probably disrupts the packing of the \n\nnon-polar soft segments of the PU and contributes to the higher packing of the polar hard \n\nsegments. Considering the P2 composite structure as a whole, it seems that the addition of \n\n2%wt ZnO to PU facilitates the chains mobility when heating during the thermal treatment, \n\nwhich corresponds in the DSC curve to a decrease in the glass transition temperature, when \n\ncompared with the unfilled PU [62]. As to the crystallization temperature, assuming that \n\nZnO particles promote a denser packing of the rigid PU segments by linkage with urethane \n\ngroup [62], it is likely that a higher temperature should be required to rearrange the PU \n\nstructure in the composite. The melting temperatures basically remain the same, at 140 \u00b0C.  \n\nThe PU loaded with 50%wt ZnO particles has suffered heavier changes, namely the \n\nappearance of two Tgs, at -20 \u00b0C and 15 \u00b0C. The Tg diminished to about -20 \u00b0C due to ZnO \n\nparticles influence which also aided in the hard chains packing leading to a raise in \n\ncrystallization temperatures to 81 and 98 \u00b0C. The new Tg at 15 \u00b0C (figure 26) appears \n\nbecause of particles agglomeration, as some zones of the polymeric mass becomes free of \n\nthe interaction of ZnO particles and hard segments influence, the soft segments could \n\norganize themselves better reflected on the new Tg. With this ZnO content the melt \n\ntemperature also doesn\u2019t change.  \n\nIt should be stressed that in both composites ZnO particles appeared well connected with \n\nthe PU, thus acting as reinforcing filler and both formulations remain stable at \n\ntemperatures between 34 and 42 \u00b0C, the range of the human body temperatures.  \n\n \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n \n\n \n\n72 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 26.

The peak in \n\nEDS analysis at 1 keV can be also attributed to sodium, Na, which is present in the SBF \n\nsolution, and thus the possibility of sodium compounds being formed is not ruled out. The \n\nICP analysis showed that some Zn\n2+\n\n ions were released to SBF media (figure 31) from the \n\nvery beginning confirming the idea of a Zinc precipitate being formed whereas phosphate \n\nand calcium SBF solution depletion were negligible even after 21 days of immersion \n\n(figures 30 and 29, respectively). It is thus concluded that the formed precipitated is mainly \n\na Zn-based precipitate with a minor amount of a calcium phosphate being detected after 21 \n\ndays according to EDS analysis as ICP analysis appear to be less sensitive to the  Ca and P \n\nwithdraw from SBF solution. It is reported that the Zn\n2+\n\n released from bone cements \n\nenhances apatite phases formation [33, 34] and in some cases these are formed in \n\npolyurethanes in hydrophilic segment of polyetherurethanes, through calcium attraction to \n\nthe oxygen ether bond [40].  \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n \n\n \n\n74 \n\n \n\nIn this way although the pure polyurethane films did not  show any precipitates formation, \n\neven after 21 days of SBF immersion (figure 27), with the aid of released Zn\n2+\n\n ions the \n\nformation of precipitated phases could be enhanced. \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nFigure 28.

The addition of \n\n50%wt of cZnO particles to PU did not change the behaviour of the PU as very small \n\nquantities of precipitate were deposited on the composites surface throughout the 21 days, \n\nwhich are believed to be phosphorus; calcium zinc compounds (figure 40 D). The low \n\nquantities of Zn\n2+\n\n released (figure 43) to the SBF solution are probably due to the low \n\nsurface area and high crystallinity of the powder; After 7 days of immersion the quantity \n\ndiminishes and this can be possibly explained  by the incorporation of Zn ions in the \n\nprecipitated phases. The aluminium detected in EDS belongs to the sample holder.

This powder has large \n\nspecific surface area (SSA) and thus is more reactive than the one with lower surface area \n\nas cZnO, It seems that its lower crystallinity and high SSA enhance ZnO dissolution.

The effect of Zn\n2+\n\n in calcium phosphates \n\nphase formation was addressed before, and the high released amount of Zn\n2+ \n\ncould \n\npromote further precipitation by saturating the solution with Zn\n2+\n\n ions that could possibly \n\nlead to the formation of new Zn-based compounds.

The peak A (2? = 28.62) can be attributed to calcium zinc \n\nphosphide, zinc phosphate and possibly brushite. The B peak (2? = 32.64) can possibly be \n\nattributed to several calcium phosphate compounds, namely hydroxyapatite or monetite. \n\nThis evidence suggests that in early stages this composite leads to the formation of several \n\nphosphorus compounds that depend on the Zn\n2+\n\n ions released to the medium that can \n\nenhance the formation of those phases.

After 14 days of immersion the XRD patterns slightly change as four \n\npeaks can be identified instead of two. As the amount of Zn\n2+\n\n ions released to the medium \n\nenhanced the formation of calcium phosphorus phases till the 10\nth\n day of the assay; (figure \n\n51) at day 14 the Zn\n2+\n\n ions concentration started decreasing in the medium probably due to \n\nfurther precipitation of a zinc phosphorus phase or to the incorporation of zinc ions in the \n\nnetwork of the already formed phases which reflected on the appearance of new peaks due \n\nto new compounds formation. The possible formed phases are brushite (2? = 28.72), \n\ncalcium phosphate (2? = 32.06, 56.56, 59.40), hydroxyapatite (2? = 32.06, 56.56, 59.40), \n\nmonetite (2? = 32.06) or zinc phosphate (2? = 28.72, 56.56, 59.40). After 21 days of \n\nimmersion the samples reflects the same behaviour as the one socked 14 days. These \n\nresults show that a myriad of phosphorus compounds can be formed during the 21 days of \n\nimmersion in SBF. It appears that initially both calcium phosphates and zinc phosphates \n\nare precipitated on the composites surface. As SBF media become enriched in Zn2+ ions \n\nmore of these compounds are formed with consequent losses of phosphorus and calcium \n\nions that give rise to the phosphorus calcium rich phases. The stabilization of calcium loss \n\nfrom the SBF solution further enhances the idea that at later times the phosphorus \n\ncompounds formed are zinc rich as the Zn2+ ions are depleted from the SBF solution. The \n\nloss of ZnO phase is possible to be detected on the XRD patterns as ZnO peaks lose their \n\nintensity from day 1 to 21. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n \n\n \n\n93 \n\n \n\nC2.

The diminishing values shows that 50 mg of both these nanoparticles alone may \n\ninduce cell death, probably due to the release of ROS species, Zn\n2+\n\n excess ions release and \n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nControl PU CZnO PZnO C2 P2 C50 P50 R1 R2\n\nC\ne\n\nll\n v\n\nia\nb\n\nil\nit\n\ny\n [\n\n%\n] \n\nSample type \n\nResazurin cell viability assay\n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n \n\n \n\n94 \n\n \n\nmechanical action, but contrarily to the observed growth and osseointegration of MC3T3-\n\nE1 osteoblasts on ZnO nanoflowers by J. K. Park, et al (2010) [35]. As the toxicity of the \n\nnanopowders is not 100%, the difference in results may be due to ZnO particles \n\nconcentration, and at smaller quantities growth and proliferation may be observed due to \n\nZn\n2+\n\n ions feed to the media and particle agglomeration. The increase of cell viability shows \n\nthe biocompatibility of the selected polymer, and what may be the cause of failure in some \n\napplications when cell proliferation is not desired. The result shows the possibility of use \n\nin the orthopaedic area as a bioactive material that can improve the bonding at the interface \n\nprosthesis/bone. The surprising fact is that both composites loaded with 2%wt nanoparticles \n\nhave an increase in cell viability of 70 and 50%, cZnO and pZnO powders respectively, \n\nwhich shows an enhancement on capability of cell proliferation of the polymer alone. This \n\nwas probably due to the release of Zn\n2+\n\n ions and to the changes in the polymer surface \n\ncaused by the ZnO particles. With 50% nanoparticles loading the decreases in cell viability \n\nare evident, with a decrease of about 22 and 30% (C50 and P50, respectively), very similar \n\nto the effect of the powders alone. This fact supports the idea that the Zn\n2+ \n\nexcess ion \n\nrelease diminishes the cell viability and that in the case of these composites cell viability is \n\nregulated by Zn\n2+\n\n ions released to the media, and cytotoxicity is not majorly related to \n\nROS liberation or mechanical action.  The trial tests on R1 and R2 composites shows \n\ninteresting results, as both composites shows a decrease in cell viability. The R1 composite \n\n(50%wt rZnO) show a 60% decrease in cell viability, probably due to a large amount of \n\nZn\n2+ \n\nrelease, related to both nanoparticles heavy concentration, larger SSA and low \n\ncrystallinity. The R2 composite (50%wt rZnO) shows a cell viability decrease of only 20% \n\nvery similar to the composites (C50 and P50). The heavy release of Zn\n2+\n\n ions occurred \n\nduring the SBF assay, and the release of this composite probably is very low and similar to \n\nthe C50 and P50 composites. Besides the Zn\n2+\n\n effect, it cannot be taken outside the \n\npossibility of nanoparticles action or the calcium phosphate layer possible inconvenience \n\nto cell proliferation. In this case the fact that cell proliferation diminished with 50%wt of \n\nZnO particles may be useful in applications were cell proliferation is a cause of failure, \n\nnamely in mechanical devices or catheters or in cases were toxicology is needed, like \n\ncancer treatment. \n\n \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n \n\n \n\n95 \n\n \n\n4. Conclusions and future work \n\n \n\n4.1. Conclusions \n\n \n\nIn the medical area novel biomaterials are needed to comply with the various demands and \n\nrequisites of the many applications. Zinc oxide establishes itself as a polyvalent material \n\nthat is suitable for many applications in the medical area, not only for its electrical \n\nproperties (such as sensors or biomarker) but also for its antibacterial properties and \n\ncytotoxic effects. Engineered nanoparticles show to be highly promising in the biomedical \n\narea as a novel material, but as this type of particles are not fully known, accurate \n\ncharacterization and careful properties evaluation is needed. As the processing of such fine \n\nparticles is extremely difficult and the size results often lye in a broad size range with poor \n\nparticle shape control, suitable processing methods are needed. \n\nIn this work we successfully obtained pure phase ZnO nanopowders by a chemical \n\nprecipitation method. Through a careful manipulation of the precipitation conditions \n\nnanoflowers-like particles consisting of agglomerated 50 nm thick ZnO platelets and 100 \n\nnm ZnO nanospheres were engineered. These powder particles when compared with \n\ncommercial ZnO nanopowders exhibit higher SSA, narrower size range and distribution \n\nwhich make them suitable for uses in biomedical applications such as drug carriers. \n\nAlthough appearing suitable for drug transport these nanoparticles have a slight cytotoxic \n\neffect on MC3T3 cell line and the toxicity may be related to an excess Zn\n2+\n\n ion release to \n\nthe media.     \n\nThe bioactivity assay revealed interesting behaviours from the composites produced with \n\nthe engineered ZnO nanoparticles. The used polymer, a medical grade thermedics SG80A \n\npolyurethane, did not exhibit bioactivity in SBF because after 21 days of immersion no \n\ncalcium phosphate layer was formed. In spite of this the cell viability assay with MC3T3 \n\ncell line showed that this polyurethane induces a small cell growth, thus confirming its \n\nbiocompatibility. Problems of mechanical device failure in vivo may arise from its use in \n\ninert devices as heart valves or catheters induced either by cell adhesion or proliferation. \n\nSuch problems may be solved by adding an adequate quantity of ZnO particles (50w%) to \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n \n\n \n\n96 \n\n \n\nthe polymer that induces cell mortality. This cytotoxicity is thought to be due to the Zn\n2+\n\n \n\nion release to the medium as most of the particles are entrapped in the polymer matrix. \n\nMoreover it closely correlates to the higher SSA of the nanospheres which have higher \n\nZn\n2+\n\n ion release capability. The 50%wt nanospheres loaded composite was surprisingly \n\nbioactive as inferred from its calcium phosphates compounds forming capability but was \n\nalso the composite with the highest mortality rate. Although not tested, these particles may \n\nalso help reducing biological films that form at the surface of medical devices thus helping \n\nto reduce infections and device failure. \n\nIn the framework of the ZnO particles cytotoxicity which is being currently addressed for \n\nnew cancer therapies, it was shown that depending on the ZnO load, some of the produced \n\ncomposites may carry such potential as is the case of the 50 w% composites. However, less \n\nloaded composites such as the ones with 2%wt ZnO showed the higher cell viability rate \n\nthus predicting its usefulness in aiding the bonding of prosthesis to the bone in spite of \n\ntheir negligible capability of inducing calcium phosphates compounds, it was thus \n\nobserved that the cytotoxicity of the produced composites varies between the noncytotoxic \n\n(2%wt) and the cytotoxic (50%wt) loaded composites, being the highest toxicity associated \n\nto the highest SSA of ZnO particles.  \n\nAs a final conclusion it may be pointed out that engineered ZnO particles with different \n\nproperties allowed producing PU/ZnO composites with the ability of eliciting distinct cell \n\nresponses, i.e. enhanced cell viability or, contrarily, enhanced cell toxicity effects. \n\nConsequently, PU/ZnO composites may be designed for applications where bone growth is \n\nrequired or for applications where the aim is to block the growth and spread of cells, as in \n\ntargeted cancer therapies.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n \n\n \n\n97 \n\n \n\n4.2. Future work \n\n \n\nIn this work two limits of ZnO loading in which cytotoxicity to MC3T3 pre-osteoblastic \n\ncell line lies were found, but further works are needed to carefully characterize both \n\nnanoparticles and composites. Accurate evaluation of particles properties should be \n\nextended to include Zeta potential, solubility, hydrophobic character, electronic related \n\nproperties, reactivity and toxicity for enabling the identification of new applications for \n\nthese particles, namely in areas like cancer treatment or nerve regeneration. \n\nFurthermore the study carried out in this project was focused on surface properties of \n\nfilms, and thus the bulk properties must be evaluated and balanced among composition, \n\nmaterials engineering and cells response.  \n\nThe clear identification of distinct toxicity limits induced by the developed composites \n\npushes to the need of investigating in vitro behaviour of other compositions both in \n\nacellular and in the presence of different cell lines in order to establish a comprehensive \n\npanel of applications suggested by the specific responses obtained.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nComp\u00f3sitos PU/ZnO para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas                             Universidade de Aveiro \n\n \n\n \n\n98 \n\n \n\nBibliography \n\n \n\n[1] A.
