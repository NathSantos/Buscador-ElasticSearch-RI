The use of these models aims\nto evaluate or predict observed phenomena or experimental data\nwith the objective of helping the development of adequate soil\nmanagement practices. Based on these considerations, eight\nmathematical models described in the literature are compared in\nthe present work, using as experimental data the mineral N\naccumulated during 32 weeks of incubation in Southern Brazilian\nsoils. To obtain mineralization values experimentally, an\nincubation-washing procedure with 0.01mol L-1 CaCl2 was used.\nMineral N was determined at the beginning of the incubation and\nin the 2nd, 4th, 8th, 16th and 32nd weeks. Among the models, the best\nfit was obtained with the simple exponential model to describe the\nmineralization of organic N in the soils. The double exponential\nmodels showed quite good fit, but may be superparametrized. In\naddition, the hypothesis on which these models are based, i.e., the\npresence of two forms of organic N susceptible to mineralization,\ncannot be sustained in this study.\n\nKey words: potentially mineralizable N, mathematical models,\nsimple and double exponential, N pools.\n\nRESUMO\n\nModelos emp\u00edricos s\u00e3o equa\u00e7\u00f5es matem\u00e1ticas que\npodem ser ajustadas a resultados experimentais.

In the\ncase of N-mineralization, the main purpose of\nmodeling is to obtain quantitative data to\nrecommend nitrogen addition (TANJI, 1982). The\ndegree of complexity of a model is determined by\nthe understanding of the system to be modeled, by\nthe availability of data and by the way the model\nwill be applied. The main limitation of the models\nthat include the mineralization of organic N is that\n\n\n\nCamargo et al.\n\nCi\u00eancia Rural, v. 32, n. 3, 2002.\n\n394\n\nthe organic N pool is very large  when compared to\nthe inorganic N pool (CAMARGO et al., 1997a),\ncausing large errors when estimating the quantity of\norganic N available to plants (TANJI et al., 1979).\n\nInitially, the mathematical fittings\nobtained for N-mineralization as a function of time\nwere described by simple exponential models,\nconsidering the existence of only one form of\npotentially mineralizable N (No), decomposing at a\nrate proportional to its concentration (STANFORD\n&amp; SMITH, 1972). When this concept was\nintroduced, several mathematical attempts to\nestimate No were proposed, using the accumulated\nvalues of mineralized N. The majority of the new\nmodels separate the organic N pool, trying to reduce\nthe errors in the estimates of No. These models\nconsider the existence of two or more fractions\noccurring in the process, a more stable and a less\nstable form, also referred to as readily and less\nreadily mineralizable N (MOLINA et al., 1980;\nINOBUSHI et al., 1985).\n\nComparative studies of simple and double\nexponential models and other functions show that\nthe best fit to N-mineralization in incubation studies\nis obtained with the double exponential function,\nespecially for short incubation times (MOLINA  et\nal., 1980; DEANS et al., 1986; CABRERA &amp;\nKISSEL, 1988). However, only a simple fit for\ncomparison is generally shown, not considering the\nbiological response of the observed data\n(CAMARGO et al., 1997b). The present work aims\nto compare mathematical models described in the\nliterature, using experimental organic-N\nmineralization data from soils of the Rio Grande do\nSul State, Brazil.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nTheoretical background: STANFORD\n&amp; SMITH (1972) proposed a biological method to\nstudy N-mineralization from organic matter\nincubated at constant temperature and moisture. The\nmineralization potential for soil nitrogen (No) was\ndefined as the fraction of the N pool considered\nsusceptible to mineralization, as long as the process\nfollows a first order kinetic. They suggested that the\nmineralization potential, No, and the mineralization\nconstant, k, could be used to predict the soil nitrogen\navailability to plants in a time period, considering\nthat mineralized N is a linear function of the square\nroot of time. This exponential model is based on the\nassumption that there is only one form of potentially\nmineralizable nitrogen, decomposed at a rate\nproportional to its concentration (Table 1). This\nform is assumed to be of a discrete size (No) and its\n\nmagnitude approaches asymptotically that of\nmineralized N (Nm) accumulated through time.\n\nEver since STANFORD &amp; SMITH\n(1972) introduced the concept of potentially\nmineralizable N (No), different mathematical\napproaches have been used to estimate its value\nusing mineralized N data. From the simple\nexponential model (Table 1) a physical meaning for\nk (specific decomposition rate) is obtained, and k is\nnot linear with time (DEANS et al. , 1986). When it\nis difficult to obtain a non-linear regression, No can\nbe obtained by the hyperbolic equation described by\nJUMA et al. (1984). According to MOLINA et al.\n(1980), neither the forms obtained by a non-linear\nnor those by linear methods give satisfying results\nfor No or k.\n\nA quite popular model is the double\nexponential described by MOLINA et al. (1980) and\nINOBUSHI et al. (1985). Both authors consider the\nexistence of two fractions within the process, one\nbeing a less stable form, and the other one more\nresistant. These models are mathematically and\nconceptually identical, but with some differences in\ninterpretation of their parameters. MOLINA et al.\n(1980) described this behavior by the equation in\ntable 1, where S and (1-S) represent, respectively,\nthe less stable and the resistant fractions of organic-\nN, decomposing at specific rates h and k. The model\ndescribed by INOBUSHI et al. (1985) was used to\nfit N-mineralization data for submerged soils. These\nauthors proposed a double exponential equation\n(Table 1), where Noq and Nos are described by first\norder kinetic reactions, with readily and less-readily\nmineralizable N, decomposed at specific rates of kq\nand ks, respectively. According to DEANS et al.\n(1986) the simple exponential equations exhibit a\nsystematic subestimation of No and a\nsuperestimation of the mineralization rate k. These\nauthors observed that the double exponential models\ngave better estimates of k with lower mean squares,\nwhich supports the hypothesis that at least two\norganic N pools contribute to mineralized N.\n\nNotwithstanding the relevance of these\nstudies, TALPAZ et al. (1981) proposed a non-linear\nfitting, considering only one mineralizable N-pool,\nwhereas SIERRA (1990) considered the simple and\ndouble exponential models only as approaches to the\nmineralization that happens within the soil organic\nmatter. This author showed that the mineralization\nrate diminishes continuously, and that it is\nimpossible to recognize mineralized N pools as\nproposed for exponential models, due to the non\nsignificance of the pool size (mineralized N). From a\npractical point of view, the number of pools to be\nincluded in the model depends on the fit and the\ndesired precision.\n\n\n\nEmpirical moldels to predict soil nitrogen mineralization.\n\nCi\u00eancia Rural, v. 32, n. 3, 2002.\n\n395\n\nExperimental data: Eight mathematical\nmodels (Table 1) were compared using experimental\ndata from the average of ten representative soils\nfrom Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, comprising a wide\nrange of organic matter (17 - 56g kg-1), nitrogen (0.9\n- 3.6g kg-1), pH (4.0 - 6.4) and clay content (180 -\n550g dm-3), described by CAMARGO et al.\n(1997b). Initially, these soils were incubated for four\nyears in micro-plots (30L) with drainage and\nexposed at field conditions. This procedure was used\nto minimize sampling and handling effects at the\nbeginning of incubation. One sample was colleted to\ndetermine soil moisture and another one with natural\nmoisture to be used, immediately, in the procedures\nof incubation described below. This method of\nincubation described by STANFORD &amp; SMITH\n(1972) was used. The method consist of using 25g of\neach soil mixed with 25g of washed sand in leaching\ntubes of 100mL. These tubes were washed first with\n0.01mol L-1 CaCl2, and then a solution without N\n(0.002mol L-1 CaSO4.2H2O,  0.002 mol L\n\n-1 MgSO4,\n0.005mol L-1 Ca(H2PO4)2. H20 and 0.00025mol \"\n\n-1\n\nK2SO4) was added and the water excess removed by\nsuction at 80 kPa. The tubes were closed to maintain\naerobic conditions and incubated at 35oC. At the\nbeginning, and after 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 weeks, the\nsoils were washed using the same procedure,\n\naccording to STANFORD &amp; SMITH (1972). NH4\n+\n\n(distillation with MgO) and NO3\n- + NO2\n\n- (distillation\nwith devarda alloy) were determined in the wash\nwater.\n\nThe fitting of the mathematical models\nwas done using SAS-ProcNLIN (SAS Institute,\n1990), an iterative method using MARQUARDT\n(1963) algorithm, obtaining convergence when the\ndecrease in residual squares in relation to that of the\nprevious iteration become negligible. The method\ndepends on initial values for the parameters,\nimportant to reduce the number of iterations and to\navoid non-convergence problems.\n\nThe initial estimates were based on the\nbehavior of the results in relation to those observed\nin the literature and afterwards determined by the\nleast number of iterations for convergence, least\nstandard error and coefficient of variation, by the\nvariation inflation factor (VIF) and by the least\ndependence between parameters (1/(1-VIF)), given\nby the SIGMASTAT (1994) software, using the\nMARQUARDT (1963) algorithm for non-linear\nmodels. To identify the most convenient model, the\nmathematical properties of the functions were\nconsidered (from a biological point of view) as well\nas the determination coefficient (R2), the adjusted\ncoefficient of determination (adjusted R2), the\n\nTable 1 - Empirical models for estimating organic N mineralization.\n\nModel    Equation Description Reference\n\na)   Simple\nExponential\n\n   Nm=No(1-exp\n-kt) Considers that N-mineralization is described by\n\nonly one pool, No, which defines the potentially\nmineralizable N as a function of t and a rate, k.\n\nSTANFORD &amp; SMITH (1972)\n\nb)   Simple\nExponential\n\n   Nm=No(1-exp\n-kt\n\nb\n) Similar to that described by STANFORD &amp;\n\nSMITH (1972), introducing a time exponent (b).\nMARION et al.

Eliminating the effect of the number of\nparameters by the adjusted R2, the fitted models\nshowed differences, with a slight superiority of the\nsimple exponential ones. This behavior could be\nexpected, given the similarity of the R2 and the higher\nnumber of parameters of the double exponential\nmodels. Among the models studied, that of JONES\n(1984) is outstanding by its fitting capacity and\ndescription of observed data. With one parameter less\nthan the models of MOLINA et al. (1980) and\nINOBUSHI et al. (1985), this model showed highest\nadjusted R2 value, showing that the use of\nsuperparametrized models, like the double exponential,\nis not essential for obtaining an adequate fit.\n\nComparing the models by residual mean\nsquares and residual standard deviation, the\nsuperiority of JONES' (1984) model is clearly seen\n(Table 2). The fit of the double exponential models\n(MOLINA et al., 1980; INOBUSHI et al., 1985)\nwas of lower quality, being superior only to the\nmodel described by BROADBENT (1986), that, in\nthe context of the present study, was the most\ninadequate. As far as the distribution of residues is\nconcerned, the models were alike; however, JONES\n(1984) model showed a distribution of residues that\n\nsuggests better fit. Examining the asymptotic\ncorrelation matrix of the parameter estimates, high\npositive and negative correlations are observed for\nthe double exponential models (MOLINA et al.,\n1980; INOBUSHI et al., 1985), indicating that they\nare superparametrized for the used data set. Models\nwith less parameters show low correlations,\nespecially that of JONES (1984).\n\nConsidering the mathematical properties\nof the functions, based on the graphical\nrepresentation of the fitted models, using the simple\nexponential as reference (Figure 1), it can be seen\nthat, as they turn into typical zero order kinetic\nreactions, a slight subestimation of mineralized N\noccurs for the last point of measurement (32 weeks).\nJONES (1984) model fits this point better (Figure 1),\nincluding the concept of initial flux of mineralization\nand active nitrogen fraction.\n\nThe parameter added to the model of\nSTANFORD &amp; SMITH (1972) by MARION et al.\n(1981), a time exponent, improved the fitting (Figure\n1). STANFORD &amp; SMITH (1972) observed that the\nmodel, made up of two parameters, does not\ndescribe adequately the initial nitrogen\nmineralization rate. These authors corrected their\nestimates adding N mineralized during the first two\nweeks of incubation to the potentially mineralizable\nN, obtained by the simple exponential function\n(containing two parameters), on the mineralized N\nafter 30 weeks of incubation. The parameter (time\nexponent) added by MARION et al. (1981) to the\nbasic mineralization equation described by\nSTANFORD &amp; SMITH (1972) has the same\nobjective and is a simpler way. Recently,\nCABRERA (1993) used a simple exponential model,\n\nTable 2 - Non-linear coefficients obtained by adjusting accumulated mineralization of organic N (average of ten soils and their replicates),\nincubated for 32 weeks in laboratory.\n\nModel a R R2 R2 adjusted RDF RSS RMS RSD CV% F\n\na) STANFORD &amp; SMITH (1972) 2 0,992 0,984 0,973 4 223,85 56,0 7,48 7,51 -\n\nb) MARION et al., (1981) 3 0,994 0,989 0,972 3 155,4 51,8 7,2 7,23 1,32nsF10(1,3)=5,5\n\nc) JONES (1984) 3 0,998 0,996 0,990 3 55,4 18,5 4,3 4,32 9,10*F10(1,3)=5,5\n\nd) CABRERA (1993) 3 0,995 0,990 0,975 3 137,4 45,8 6,77 6,80 1,89nsF10(1,3)=5,5\n\ne) MOLINA et al., (1980) 4 0,995 0,990 0,951 2 136,9 68,5 8,28 8,32 0,63nsF10(2,2)=9,0\n\nf) INOBUSHI et al., (1985) 4 0,995 0,990 0,951 2 136,9 68,5 8,28 8,32 0,63nsF10(2,2)=9,0\n\ng) JUMA et al., (1984) 2 0,994 0,989 0,982 4 154,2 38,5 6,2 6,23 1,45nsF10(4,4)=4,1\n\nh) BROADBENT (1986) 2 0,976 0,958 0,930 4 584,7 146,2 12,09 12,15 2,61nsF10(4,4)=4,1\n\na = Number of parameters; F = comparison with STANFORD &amp; SMITH (1972); RDF = Residual degrees of freedom; RSS = Residual sum\nof squares; RMS = Residual mean of squares; RSD = Residual standard deviation.\n\n\n\nEmpirical moldels to predict soil nitrogen mineralization.\n\nCi\u00eancia Rural, v. 32, n. 3, 2002.\n\n397\n\nincluding the mineralization rate of the most stable\nnitrogen pool. Therefore, the application of this\nmodel is based on the existence of two pools of\norganic N being mineralized.\n\nSTANFORD &amp; SMITH (1972) verified\nfor 39 soils that the variation of N-mineralization\nrate was very small (k=0.054 \u00b1 0.009. week-1),\nsuggesting that the main source of mineralized N\nwas the same for all soils. A reevaluation of the\nexperimental data of these authors by MOLINA et\nal. (1980) revealed that a better fit of the simple\nexponential model depends on the presence of\nvarious organic N pools, each one with its own\nmineralization rate. Following this principle,\nINOBUSHI et al. (1985) assumed the existence of\ntwo nitrogen pools in the mineralization process in\n\n30 flooded soils from Japan. The application of the\ndouble exponential model described by these authors\n(MOLINA et al. 1980; INOBUSHI et al. 1985) to\nthe results of the present paper showed good fit to\nthe data observed after the second week (Figure 1).\n\nThe first data point was not well fitted by\nthe models, with a deviation of 11.55mg N kg-1 of\nsoil. The only model that estimated zero time well\nwas the simple exponential model described by\nJONES (1984), representing an important factor for\nthe mathematical estimation of residual nitrogen\npresent at the beginning of mineralization. This\nresult was expected because the other authors did not\ngenerally use time zero in their adjustments because\nat this time the mineralization had not begun.

However, they did not give any\nmore attention to this model, used only as a mean of\npre-estimating No for the simple exponential model.\nIt is a fact that the parabolic model fitted the data\nbetter than the simple exponential model for some\nsoils, not for all of them. BROADBENT (1986),\nbased on the hypothesis that a better estimate of\nmineralized N could be obtained using the parabolic\nequation, used values for the time exponent different\nfrom 0.5. A comparison between the parabolic model\nand the exponential model described by STANFORD\n&amp; SMITH (1972) (Figure 1) showed a better fit with\nthe late model. In their original paper, STANFORD &amp;\nSMITH (1972) estimated k and No by a non-linear\nfitting of mineralized N as a function of incubation\ntime. This fit is worse than the non-linear model when\nestimating the mineralization parameters and for the\nfitting of exponential data (SMITH et al., 1980). As in\nthe present paper, the treatment given to the\nexponential model is non-linear; hence the greate\ndifference between the models can be justified.\n\nSome other differences among the\nparameters estimated by the eight models can be\nobserved (Figure 1). As far as the potentially\nmineralizable N (No = 145.92 mg kg\n\n-1) in the model\nof STANFORD &amp; SMITH (1972) is concerned,\nsome models subestimated its value, such as those\ndescribed by JONES (92.2% of No), CABRERA\n(88.1% of No) and BROADBENT (47.2% of No),\nwhile other superestimated it, like those of\nMARION et al. (103.6% of No), JUMA et al.\n(113.9% of No), INOBUSHI et al. (118.1% do No),\nand MOLINA et al. (118.1% of No).\n\nNitrogen mineralization rates obtained in\nthis work were higher than those cited in the\nliterature. This may be due to the nature of the\nprocess, with intense mineralization in the first\nweeks followed by a relatively long period of\nstabilization when compared to the mineralization\nperiods. The occurrence of these high initial rates\nmay be associated with an increase of microbial\nactivity, induced by the handling and preparing of\nthe samples. This is a recognized fact, and some\nauthors even neglect the zero time mineralized N for\nthis reason (STANFORD &amp; SMITH, 1972), while\nother (MATAR et al., 1991) start their calculations\nof accumulated mineralized N from the 4th week.\nApplying these methods to the data of the present\npaper, mineralization rates decrease from an average\nof 0.3196 week-1, to 0.2530 week-1, if considered\n\nfrom the 2nd week, and to 0.129 week-1, if considered\nfrom the 4th week (CAMARGO et al., 1997b).\n\nThe comparison of the models reveals that\nthe simple exponential model described well the\nmineralization of organic N in soils from Southern\nBrazil. The active fraction (N2) and the initial flux\n(N1) parameters that compose the model of JONES\n(1984) can represent the residual mineral N (N1)\nthat, together with the potentially mineralizable\nfraction (N2) and could be used as a simplification\nfor N fertilizer recommendation. Considering that\nthe models studied in this paper are linked to that\none of STANFORD &amp; SMITH (1972), but including\na higher number of parameters, the only model that\npresented a significant increase 10% of the\nexplanation variability for mineralized N (F value;\nTable 2), in relation to the model of STANFORD &amp;\nSMITH (1972) was the model of JONES (1984).\n\nThe double exponential models fit the\ndata satisfactorily, however, only a little\nimprovement was observed when compared to the\nsimple exponential ones, indicating that the\nsuperparametrization of these models is not justified\nwhen few points are used. In this case, the use of\nmodels with more than tree parameters did not fit\nvery well because the low number of degrees of\nfreedom. Nevertheless, it is possible to conclude that\nduring the growing period, or during the incubation\nperiod studied (32 weeks), there was no contribution\nfrom the recalcitrant fraction to the mineralized\norganic N balance. This fact is confirmed by data\nobtained from 26 soils by KEENEY &amp; BREMNER\n(1966), who divided organic N into that found\nbefore and after a year of incubation. The\ndifferences between the divided organic forms in\nthis period were not significant, as well as the\nrecovery of exchangeable ammonium, showing that\nsuch a situation does not require a higher number of\nparameters for a better fit.\n\nThe unstable or easily mineralizable\nfraction is mineralized at rates up to 10% per year\n(HEBERT, 1982). In the present study, a rate of\nabout 7% was observed, characterizing the absence\nof nitrogen originating from the recalcitrant fraction.\nThe double exponential models give a better fit than\nthe simple exponential models, which is expected\ngiven the elevated number of parameters. However,\nthose models present indications of\nsuperparametrization and the hypothesis that these\nmodels characterize the presence of two forms of\norganic N susceptible to mineralization can not be\nsustained or is sometimes impossible\n(DENDOOVEN et al., 1997). To test the hypothesis\nthat there are two organic N pools a 1-2 year-\n\n\n\nEmpirical moldels to predict soil nitrogen mineralization.\n\nCi\u00eancia Rural, v. 32, n. 3, 2002.\n\n399\n\nperiod of incubation is need. In this case, it is\npossible that the double exponential models would\nshow some advantages over the single exponential\nmodels. Results from DOU et al. (1996) study show\nthat the pool size and mineralization rate parameters\nin the different models are merely mathematically\ndefined quantities and do not represent any\nrigorously-defined pool size of potentially-\nmineralizable N and their mineralization rate\nconstants in the soils.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nBased on the results obtained in this study\nand on the numerical and graphical analysis of the\nmodels, is possible to conclude that the simple\nexponential model proposed by JONES (1984) is the\none that best describes the mineralization process\nand the potential of organic N to be released to the\nenvironment and to become available for plants.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nBROADBENT, F.E.
