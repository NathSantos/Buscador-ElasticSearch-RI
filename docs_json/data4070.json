The area is constituted by \n\nNeoproterozoic limestones from the Sete Lagoas Formation, where karst conduits \n\nwere developed, giving origin to the homonymous aquifer, which is covered by \n\nCenozoic unconsolidated sediments and, occasionally, by Neoproterozoic \n\nmetasedimentary rocks from the Serra de Santa Helena Formation. It was observed \n\nthat in this aquifer the primary porosity is very low and the secondary porosity (micro-\n\nfractures) is also reduced, due to the filling by calcite. The great volume of \n\ngroundwater migrates through the tertiary porosity characterized by two dominant \n\nsolutionally enlarged bedding planes and, to a lesser extent, by sub-vertical enlarged \n\nfractures. The recharge, related to rainfall occurring from October to December, takes \n\nplace through sinkholes, caves entrances, and where the limestones are under the \n\nCenozoic sediments. A detailed study evaluating the scale effects also allowed the \n\nestablishment of permeability distributions of the Sete Lagoas Aquifer. Other results \n\nobtained also established that the groundwater extractions are associated to karst \n\ngeotechnical events located in the urbanized area of the municipality. The high \n\ngroundwater extractions make the shallowest solutionally enlarged bedding plane, in \n\nsome points, entirely in the unsaturated zone, causing geotechnical events. A \n\ngeotechnical map identifies five levels of risk, based on the lithology and the \n\ngroundwater level interaction. This type of mapping should guide the groundwater \n\nextractions and caring the urban land occupation in Sete Lagoas, preventing or \n\ndelaying the occurrence of new subsidences or collapses. \n\n \n\nKeywords: hydrogeology, karst, geotechnical risk, geochemistry, stable isotopes. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nvi \n\n \n\nRESUMO \n\n \n\nEsta pesquisa integrou estudos geol\u00f3gicos, hidrogeol\u00f3gicos, geoqu\u00edmicos e de \n\nis\u00f3topos est\u00e1veis no munic\u00edpio de Sete Lagoas (MG), Brasil, com o objetivo de \n\nentender a circula\u00e7\u00e3o da \u00e1gua em terreno c\u00e1rstico e propor alternativas para o seu \n\nmelhor uso, a fim de se evitar problemas geot\u00e9cnicos. A \u00e1rea \u00e9 constitu\u00edda por \n\ncalc\u00e1rios neoproterozoicos da Forma\u00e7\u00e3o Sete Lagoas, onde se desenvolveram \n\ncondutos c\u00e1rsticos, dando origem ao aqu\u00edfero hom\u00f4nimo, o qual est\u00e1 coberto por \n\nsedimentos cenozoicos inconsolidados e, ocasionalmente, por rochas \n\nmetasedimentares neoproterozoicas da Forma\u00e7\u00e3o Serra de Santa Helena. Foi \n\nobservado que neste aqu\u00edfero a porosidade prim\u00e1ria \u00e9 muito baixa e a secund\u00e1ria \n\n(micro-fraturas) \u00e9 igualmente reduzida, devido ao preenchimento por calcita. O \n\ngrande volume de \u00e1gua subterr\u00e2nea migra atrav\u00e9s da porosidade terci\u00e1ria \n\ncaracterizada dominantemente por dois planos de acamamentos carstificados e, em \n\nmenor grau, por fraturas sub-verticais carstificadas. A recarga, relacionada \u00e0s \n\nchuvas que ocorrem no per\u00edodo de outubro a dezembro, se d\u00e1 atrav\u00e9s de \n\nsumidouros, entradas de cavernas e onde o calc\u00e1rio est\u00e1 sob os sedimentos \n\ncenozoicos. Um detalhado estudo avaliando os efeitos de escala permitiu tamb\u00e9m o \n\nestabelecimento da distribui\u00e7\u00e3o das permeabilidades do Aqu\u00edfero Sete Lagoas. \n\nOutros resultados obtidos tamb\u00e9m estabeleceram que as extra\u00e7\u00f5es de \u00e1guas \n\nsubterr\u00e2neas est\u00e3o associadas aos eventos geot\u00e9cnicos c\u00e1rsticos localizados na \n\n\u00e1rea urbana do munic\u00edpio. A elevada extra\u00e7\u00e3o das \u00e1guas subterr\u00e2neas faz com que \n\no plano de acamamento carstificado mais raso, em algumas \u00e1reas, esteja \n\ninteiramente na zona n\u00e3o saturada, provocando os eventos geot\u00e9cnicos. Um mapa \n\nde risco geot\u00e9cnico identifica, a partir da litologia e do n\u00edvel de \u00e1gua subterr\u00e2nea, \n\ncinco n\u00edveis.

This region has a population \n\ngreater than 200,000, over an area of 538 km\n2\n, where the urban development was \n\nmore intense in the central portion of this municipality. Geologically, the area is \n\nlocated in the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton, where carbonate argillo-arenaceous sediments \n\nare emplaced giving origin to the Bambu\u00ed Group. In this group, karst conduits in the \n\nlimestones from the Sete Lagoas Formation were developed, which are storing a \n\nlarge amount of groundwater. Because of this, the current water supply is almost \n\nentirely groundwater from the Sete Lagoas karst aquifer. As it is common in \n\ndeveloping countries like Brazil, mostly cities has rapid urban growth having not \n\nalways been guided by planning, reflecting sometimes in water supply problems for \n\nlocal populations. These features also take place in Sete Lagoas, with an \n\naggravating factor: the location of this city in a karst region, which problems related to \n\ngeotechnical issues caused by groundwater exploitation, as well as problems in \n\nwater supply during dry season, are common. The results obtained in this \n\nmultidisciplinary research, where some methodologies used in this thesis were never \n\napplied for karst regions, especially in Brazil, were used to understand the water \n\ncirculation in this karst terrain and its behaviors with others geological formations, \n\nand then giving alternative responses for a better use of water, mitigating problems \n\nrelated to that. \n\n \n\n1.2 Objectives and justifications \n\n \n\nThe main goal of this thesis was to characterize quantitatively and qualitatively \n\nthe Sete Lagoas karst aquifer and its relationship with other rock formations in order \n\nto understand: (1) the underlying mechanisms that control the water circulation; (2) \n\nthe possible origin of groundwater recharge and its flowpaths; (3) the multi-scale \n\npermeability structure evaluation (in small-, well-, and regional-scale); and (4) the \n\nphysical mechanisms of subsidence and collapse development. Investigating all \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Introduction \n\nDoctoral Thesis 2 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nthese mechanisms is important because of the increasing demands on this karst \n\naquifer, which require users to have a better understanding of how it functions, so \n\nthat it can be properly utilized and protected, avoiding water resource degradations, \n\nas well as facilitating stakeholder decision making in urban planning. \n\n \n\n1.3 Structure of this thesis \n\n \n\nThis doctoral thesis is organized in the form of scientific papers, which were \n\npublished, accepted and submitted to international journals. Thus, each chapter can \n\nbe read relatively independently to the others. After the Chapter 1 \"Introduction\", it is \n\npresented the Chapter 2 containing the site descriptions and its hydrogeological \n\nfeatures.  \n\nThe Chapter 3 is about the main methods used in the research to understand \n\nthe circulation of groundwater and its relationships in karst terrains, while the Chapter \n\n4 is the state of art \"Karst hydrogeology: origins and concepts\".  \n\nThe Chapter 5 contains the paper \"Geologic conceptual model of the \n\nmunicipality of Sete Lagoas (MG, Brazil) and the surroundings\", accepted in the \n\nAnais da Academia Brasileira de Ci\u00eancias [Annals of the Brazilian Academy of \n\nSciences] (Galv\u00e3o et al. in press). This paper was important to understand, firstly, the \n\nspatial distribution and the structural framework geometry to establish a new geologic \n\nperspective of the region before developing the other papers. \n\nThe Chapter 6 presents the paper \"Evaluating karst geotechnical risk in the \n\nurbanized area of Sete Lagoas, MG, Brazil\", already published in the Hydrogeology \n\nJournal (Galv\u00e3o et al. 2015). The primary goal of this paper was to evaluate and \n\nidentify the potential subsidence or collapse risk zones. Aerial photographs, lithologic \n\nwell profiles, optical well logs, and geologic mapping were utilized to categorize risk \n\nfactors influencing karst subsidence and collapse, using an index system. The results \n\nshowed that the majority of the urbanized area overlies mantled limestone from the \n\nSete Lagoas Formation covered with unconsolidated sediments contained within a \n\ngraben, resulting in barrier boundaries for groundwater. Five risks zones in the \n\nmunicipality were identified (negligible, low, moderate, considerable, and high) \n\nrelated to geologic and hydrologic risk factors. The urbanized area is located largely \n\nin the high-risk zone where the majority of the collapse features are located.  \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Introduction \n\nDoctoral Thesis 3 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nThe Chapter 7 contains the paper \"The karst permeability scale effect of Sete \n\nLagoas, MG, Brazil\", submitted in the Journal of Hydrology (Galv\u00e3o et al. in review). \n\nThe Sete Lagoas karst aquifer was used to evaluate the permeability structure across \n\na range of scales in order to develop a quantitative model of permeable features that \n\nis consistent across all scales of measurement, from matrix properties to regional-\n\nscale flow. This aquifer has some wells that do not have measurable drawdown \n\nduring pumping due to high permeability. Based on bulk permeability measurements, \n\ninverted estimate of the size of hydraulic features, and the permeability combination \n\nforward modeling, the results indicated an increase in permeabilities from the matrix- \n\nto well-scale, but a decrease of these parameters from well- to regional-scale due to \n\nthe localized development of karst bedding plane dissolution in one structurally \n\ncontrolled region of the aquifer. The physical sizes of permeable features of the \n\naquifer are consistent across the scales of data collection and their geometry \n\nprovides a quantitative understanding of the scale effects of permeability \n\nmeasurements. \n\nThe Chapter 8 presents the paper \"Stable isotopes and geochemical studies to \n\nevaluate flowpaths and recharge areas in an urban karst aquifer in Sete Lagoas, MG, \n\nBrazil\", to be submitted in the Annals of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences. The \n\nmain goal was identify indirectly the various sources and areas of recharge in the \n\nkarst area, its flowpaths, and surface-ground water interaction, which is important for \n\nproper water resource management, avoiding eventual contaminations and other \n\nfuture water quality problems. Analyzing data of stable isotopes \n18\n\nO and \n2\nH and \n\nmajor ions measurements, it was possible to understand that the origin of \n\ngroundwater is directly from precipitation, having a limited period of recharge. In the \n\ncentral urbanized area, where the karst aquifer is in contact with Cenozoic \n\nunconsolidated sediments, there may be punctual superficial water infiltration. The \n\nmajor ions concentrations presented the highest values at the same region, where \n\nthe most developed karstic structure was found in the Sete Lagoas Formation. These \n\ndata could suggest larger water reservoir indicating more mineralization, which are in \n\nconcordance with the geologic information.  \n\nChapter 9 consists in a synthesis of the overall conclusions acquired from all \n\nthe results and discussions from the papers and general recommendations for future \n\nworks. \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Site descriptions \n\nDoctoral Thesis 4 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 2: SITE DESCRIPTION \n\n \n\nThe municipality of Sete Lagoas is located in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, \n\n70 km northwest of Belo Horizonte, the state capital. This region has a population \n\ngreater than 200,000 over an area of 538 km\n2\n (IBGE 2010). The urban development \n\nwas more intense in the northern and northeastern sectors, in comparison to the \n\ninitial settlement (Fig. 1). There is a considerable industrial activity located mainly \n\nalong the main federal highway, which is a corridor of significant growth. Rapid urban \n\ndevelopment has not always been guided by planning, especially in relation to \n\nenvironmental and geotechnical issues, reflected by 17 documented occurrences of \n\nsubsidence or/and collapse since 1988 (Pe\u00f1aranda J and Cordeiro A. \n\nHydrogeologists, Servmar Environmental &amp; Engineering, unpublished data, 2013). \n\nThe majority of these occurrences are clustered in the central portion of the \n\nurbanized area, which the most important event happened in 1988 (Silva 1988), \n\nwhen a collapse having around a 20 meters in diameter was registered. \n\n \n\nFig. 1. Location map of Sete Lagoas, in UTM coordinates, showing the urbanized area limits \nlocated in the central portion of the municipality. Is also showed the location of the SAAE's \npublic supply wells, where the majority of them are located in the urban area, where it is \npossible to obtain the highest discharge rates in well. \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Site descriptions \n\nDoctoral Thesis 5 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nGeologically, the area is located in the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton, where \n\nNeoproterozoic carbonate argillo-arenaceous sediments are emplaced giving origin \n\nto the Bambu\u00ed Group (Branco and Costa 1961, Oliveira 1967, Sch\u00f6ll and Foga\u00e7a \n\n1973, Dardene 1978, Schobbenhaus 1984, Ribeiro et al. 2003, Tuller et al. 2010). \n\nThe statigraphy of the region can be seen in the Fig. 2.  \n\nThe Archaean basement is represented by the Belo Horizonte Complex, which \n\nis generally characterized by a set of gneissic rocks and migmatite zones, with \n\npolymetamorphic features, belonging to the geotectonic unit corresponding to the \n\nS\u00e3o Francisco Craton (Ribeiro et al. 2003). Epigenic and igneous \n\nmetamorphic/migmatite rocks with plutonic features mark this occurrence. Mafic \n\nintrusions may also occur, which preferentially fills in the fracture planes. The \n\ncontacts between different lithotypes are generally transitional, mainly between \n\ngneiss, migmatites and/or granitoids. The granitoids are light gray to white, with \n\ngranulation varying from gross to medium, sometimes with sparse porphyroblasts of \n\ntabular feldspars, xenoliths from other rocks or restites from partial fusion (Tuller et \n\nal. 2010). This complex was intensely affected by basic injections, provoking the \n\nappearance of a group of basic rock dikes (Ribeiro et al. 2003).  \n\nOverlying the basement, the Bambu\u00ed Group is represented by the lower Sete \n\nLagoas Formation (Dardenne 1978) and the upper Serra de Santa Helena Formation \n\n(Branco and Costa 1961) (Fig. 2). The Sete Lagoas Formation is divided and \n\ncharacterized by two members (Ribeiro et al. 2003): Pedro Leopoldo, at the base, \n\ncomposed of fine limestones, dolomites, marlstones and pelites; and Lagoa Santa, \n\non the top, composed of medium-grained black limestones. In general, the lower \n\ncontact of this formation with rocks from the basement is abrupt, discordant and \n\ntectonic, with faults. The upper contact with the Serra de Santa Helena Formation is \n\nmost commonly abrupt as well. The Serra de Santa Helena Formation is composed \n\nof slate, marble, siltstone and argillite. This formation overlies the Sete Lagoas \n\nFormation with abrupt, tectonic, or occasionally, gradational contacts. With the \n\nbasement, the contacts are abrupt and discordant (angular discordance), tectonic, by \n\nthrust belt faults, easily seen on the basin border (Tuller et al. 2010). Three \n\nstratigraphic members constitute this formation (Grossi et al. 1998): (1) lower, \n\nrepresented by silt-clay rhythmites, generally carbonaceous, and dark shales; (2) \n\nmiddle, by marble and shales; and (3) upper, constituted by shales, siltstones, slate \n\ncleavage, and cross bedding.  \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Site descriptions \n\nDoctoral Thesis 6 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nThe Bambu\u00ed Group is covered by the Cenozoic unconsolidated sediments, \n\ndivided into (1) detritus coverage, (2) alluvial terraces, and (3) alluvium (Ribeiro et al. \n\n2003). The detritus coverage is composed of sediments with a predominant red color, \n\nsand to silt with varying levels of gravel, which occur indistinctly on all units, but \n\nmainly over the Serra de Santa Helena Formation. The alluvial terraces occur along \n\ndrainages and are mainly constituted of semi-consolidated sand to silt material, with \n\nwhitish to yellowish and reddish color. The alluvium occurs along the meanders of the \n\nlarge watercourses. They are composed of fine to coarse sand, with discontinuous \n\namounts of quartz pebbles, siltstone and sandstone (Tuller et al. 2010). \n\nGeomorphologically, the area is in a karst setting, which provides the presence \n\nof lakes (located mainly in the central area), caves, sinkholes, and closed drainage \n\nbasins (Pessoa 1996, Ribeiro et al. 2003, Tuller et al. 2010). Areas that have denser \n\ndrainage are related to the Santa Helena Ridge foothills in the center, basement \n\noutcrops in the south, and metasediments in the north. The elevation of the area \n\nranges from around 750 to 1000 m, declining from southwest to northeast, where the \n\nhighest elevations are located in the Santa Helena Ridge (Fig. 2).  \n\nRegarding the hydrogeology, the Sete Lagoas karst aquifer consists of \n\nNeoproterozoic limestones, which the groundwater is predominantly classified as a \n\ncalcium-bicarbonate type, with pH values between 6.5 and 7.5, being slightly basic. \n\nRegarding the electrical conductivity, this groundwater has an average of 333 \n\n?mhos/cm, combining with the high levels of dissolved salts (calcium and \n\nbicarbonate). This water, stored in karst conduits, offers good quality for human \n\nconsumption, only presenting a light level of water hardness, sometimes causing an \n\nunpleasant taste and problems of encrustation in pipes with smaller diameter \n\n(Pessoa 1996). These limestones dip and become thicker and completely covered by \n\ncompetent rocks from the Serra de Santa Helena Formation to the northeast, \n\nconsidered as the local aquiclude. The Belo Horizonte basement works as a fissure \n\naquifer, where the groundwater is stored in the fractures/faults, which is an \n\nalternative source of groundwater for the municipality.  \n\nBecause of these hydrogeological features, the current municipal water supply \n\nis almost entirely groundwater from the Sete Lagoas karst aquifer, with less \n\ncontribution from the basement, which is managed by the Water Supply and Sewage \n\nService (SAAE) [SAAE - Servi\u00e7o Aut\u00f4nomo de \u00c1gua e Esgoto]. For these, this \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Site descriptions \n\nDoctoral Thesis 7 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\ncompany has more than 100 public wells located especially in the urbanized area, \n\nwhere it is possible to obtain the highest discharge rates (Fig. 1).  \n\nThe mean total monthly precipitation is 106 mm, while the total annual is 1271.8 \n\nmm. The rainy season occurs from October to March, with total rainfall of 1132 mm, \n\naccounting for 89% of annual precipitation. The period with less precipitation occurs \n\nfrom April to September, with 139 mm. The average annual temperature is 20.9 \u00baC, \n\nwith July having the lowest monthly mean value (17.5 \u00b0C), and February the highest \n\none (22.9 \u00b0C). The annual variation is around 5\u00b0C. According to Pessoa (1996), the \n\nwater balance in Sete Lagoas is divided, monthly, in: (1) water excess from January \n\nto March; (2) water deficit from April to September; and (3) water replacement \n\nbetween October and December, the period of recharging. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 2.

For better understanding, these methodologies will be separated by \n\ngeological and hydrogeological approaches. For geological issues, geologic \n\nmapping, aerial photography interpretation, lithologic well profiles, and optical well log \n\nanalysis were made. For hydrogeological issues, pumping tests were run, and water \n\ntable measurements were made. Groundwater samples, superficial water and \n\nrainwater were collected for stable isotopes analysis and just groundwater samples \n\nwere used for chemical analysis of major ions. These sets of data were integrated to \n\nbe evaluated analytically and empirically to understand the mechanisms of the water \n\ncirculation in the local karst aquifer and its relationships between other geological \n\nformations. These methods are presented sequentially followed by the approach to \n\ndata integration. \n\n \n\n3.1 Geological approaches \n\n \n\n3.1.1 Geologic mapping \n\nGeologic mapping of the Sete Lagoas was carried out in a scale of 1:25,000. \n\nThe classification of the sedimentary rocks followed the definitions of Folk (1980) and \n\nthe microscopic classification of the carbonate rocks followed the definitions of Folk \n\n(1959) and Dunham (1962). For the metamorphic and igneous rocks, the \n\nclassification followed the definitions of Winter (2001). All the data were recorded on \n\npaper topographic maps and converted to digital format. Later, integration of the field \n\ndata and the sheet geologic maps Baldim (SE.23-Z-C-III), Sete Lagoas (SE.23-Z-C-\n\nII), Contagem (SE.23-Z-C-V), and Belo Horizonte (SE.23-Z-C-VI), scale 1:100,000, \n\nwas performed. These maps were acquired from the CPRM database, available on: \n\nhttp://geobank.sa.cprm.gov.br/.  \n\nAerial photography interpretation (scale 1:40,000, dated 1977) and the SRTM \n\nimage (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission), Sheet SE-23-Z-C, acquired from the \n\nEMBRAPA's website (EMBRAPA 2006) were evaluated to define the map view \n\nlithologic contacts (http://www.relevobr.cnpm.embrapa.br).  \n\nThe locations of karst features (caves and sinkholes) were acquired from the \n\nNational Center for Research and Conservation of Cave's website [CECAV - Centro \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Materials and methods \n\nDoctoral Thesis 10 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nNacional de Pesquisa e Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o de Cavernas], as a GIS file, available on: \n\nhttp://www.icmbio.gov.br/cecav/downloads (CECAV 2009).  \n\n \n\n3.1.2 Subsurface lithologic contact  \n\n In order to obtain information on subsurface about lithologic contacts and karst \n\nfeatures, lithologic well profiles were analyzed and optical well logs were run.  \n\nFor lithologic well profiles, a series of 218 profiles located in the municipalities of \n\nBaldim, Caetan\u00f3polis, Capim Branco, Cordisburgo, Esmeralda, Fortuna de Minas, \n\nFunil\u00e2ndia, Inha\u00fama, Inimutaba, Lagoa Santa, Maravilhas, Matozinhos, Papagaio, \n\nParaobepa, Pedro Leopoldo, Prudente de Morais, S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 da Lapa, and Sete \n\nLagoas were acquired from the SIAGAS database, at the website: \n\nhttp://siagasweb.cprm.gov.br/layout/. In addition, 52 public well profiles located in \n\nSete Lagoas were analyzed, provided by Water Supply and Sewage Service \n\ndatabase (SAAE) [SAAE -Servi\u00e7o de Abastecimento de \u00c1gua e Esgoto]. Out of the \n\n270 profiles that were analyzed, the best and the most reliable were chosen.  \n\nOptical well analysis yielded 30 vertical image profiles collected with R-Cam \n\n1000 Camera (Laval Underground Surveys). In addition to the standard downhole \n\nview, this camera offered a 360 degrees side-view perspective, capable of capturing \n\na comprehensive survey of water wells. The camera had a maximum depth of 300 \n\nmeters and was connected to a receiver with monitor that enabled real time imaging. \n\nTherefore, it was possible to register the depths of dissolution zones, fractures and \n\nlithologic contacts. The location of these optical well logs can be seen in the Fig. 3. \n\n \n\n3.2 Hydrogeological approaches \n\n \n\n3.2.1 Pumping tests \n\nTo obtain information about hydrogeological parameters, long transient \n\npumping tests and drawdown tests were run in the SAAE\u2019s public supply wells (Fig. \n\n3). Nine long duration transient pumping tests (48 hours) were made to calculate \n\nwell-scale transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity using the Thiem (1906) and Theis \n\n(1935) methods. These tests involved pumping a well at a constant rate and \n\nmeasuring the drawdown in water level in some observation wells. \n\nTwenty-seven time-drawdown or step-drawdown tests to estimate specific \n\ncapacity were made, consisting of a measure of the productivity pumping in a well at \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Materials and methods \n\nDoctoral Thesis 11 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\na constant rate and measuring the resulting drawdown in water level. In mathematical \n\nterms, the specific capacity is defined as the pumping rate in the well, divided by the \n\nobserved decline in hydraulic head in the well, from a time-drawdown test. For the \n\nstep-drawdown tests, every discharge value was divided by its respective drawdowns \n\nobserved in each step and, then, the mean specific capacity was calculated.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 3. Location map of the thirty optical well logs (pink color, top/left figure); and the \npumping tests, divide by twenty-seven time-drawdown or step-drawdown tests (green color, \ntop/right figure), and nine long duration transient pumping tests (red color, bottom/right \nfigure).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Materials and methods \n\nDoctoral Thesis 12 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\n3.2.2 Stable isotopes samples \n\nGroundwater samples were taken during August 2011 and November 2012 in \n\n30 SAAE's public supply wells (25 samples from Sete Lagoas karst aquifer and 5 \n\nsamples from the basement) (Fig. 4). The wells located in the central area are \n\npumping waters from the conduits in the karst aquifer. These samples were taken \n\nafter removing several well volumes of water, using pumps installed in these wells. \n\nThis was done to purge the aquifer of stagnant water and to acquire fresh aquifer \n\nsamples for analysis. After sampling, physicochemical parameters (pH, temperature - \n\nT, electrical conductivity - EC, and oxidation-reduction potential - ORP) using the HI \n\n9828 portable multiparameter meter were measured.  \n\nThe surface water samples were collected in June 2013 in seven lakes: Brej\u00e3o, \n\nGrande, Jos\u00e9 Felix, Paulino, Pedras, Piranhas, and Fazenda da Morada (Fig. 4). For \n\nthis, samples were taken in the center of each lake using a peristaltic pump (brand \n\nGeopump). This method followed the low flow principle, avoiding sediment from the \n\nlake's substrate (Puls and Barcelona 1996). \n\nEleven cumulative monthly rain isotope samples were also collected \n\nrepresenting a hydrological year, from April 2012 to April 2013 (no samples in July \n\n2012 due to lack of rain). For this, a polypropylene bottle (10 L) with an also \n\npolypropylene funnel connected in that bottle were used and placed in a cooler to \n\nkeep the temperature and prevent sunlight penetration. A silicone hose with 6 m long \n\nwas also attached on the bottle to balance the pressure and prevent exchanges with \n\natmospheric air. This method followed the GNIP (Global Network of Isotopes in \n\nPrecipitation) instruction, where evaporation and loss of lighter isotopes are negligible \n\n(IAEA/WMO 2004).  \n\nThe main concern with these samples was to avoid the post-sampling \n\nfractionation. For this, pre-cleaned polypropylene vials (30 ml) were used. These \n\nvials were completely filled with samples, avoiding air bubbles inside and stored in \n\ncoolers maintaining the temperature. All samples were analyzed for \n18\n\nO and \n2\nH at the \n\nGroundwater Research Center (CEPAS) [CEPAS - Centro de Pesquisas de \u00c1guas \n\nSubterr\u00e2neas], Institute of Geosciences, University of S\u00e3o Paulo. The samples were \n\nrun on PICARRO L2130i, processed by Laboratory Information Management System \n\n(LIMS) for Lasers software, and were normalized to internal laboratory water \n\nstandards that were previously calibrated relative to the Vienna Standard Mean \n\nOcean Water (VSMOW). The results were expressed as ?\n18\n\nO and ?\n2\nH, where ?sample \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Materials and methods \n\nDoctoral Thesis 13 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\n(\u2030) = ((Rsample /Rstandard) ? 1) \u00d7 1000, where R is D/H, \n18\n\nO/\n16\n\nO. The analytical \n\nprecisions were \u00b10.09\u2030 for ?\n18\n\nO and \u00b10.9\u2030 for ?\n2\nH. \n\nAfter all of these analyzes, the samples were compared with the latest Global \n\nMeteoric Water Line (GMWL) reported by Rozansky (1993), available at IAEA \n\nwebsite: http://isohis.iaea.org. This meteoric water line is linearly related by the \n\nequation ?\n2\nH = 8.17?\n\n18\nO + 11.27, and it is an enhancement to the first meteoric water \n\nline proposed by Craig (1961), related by the equation ?\n2\nH = 8 ?\n\n18\nO + 10. This high \n\ncorrelation coefficient reflects the fact that the oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopes \n\nin water molecules are intimately associated. \n\n \n\n3.2.3 Geochemistry analysis \n\nThe same supply wells used to collect groundwater samples for isotopic \n\nanalysis were also used for geochemistry evaluation (Fig. 4). Samples for major \n\ncations (Na\n+\n, K\n\n+\n, Ca\n\n2+\n, Mg\n\n2+\n), major anions (HCO\n\n-\n3, CO\n\n-2\n3, SO\n\n2-\n4, Cl\n\n-\n, NO\n\n-\n3), total \n\ndissolved solids (TDS), and total water hardness (WH) were collected in pre-cleaned \n\n1 L plastic polyethylene bottles, and then stored in coolers at 4\u00b0C, according to the \n\nSampling and Water Samples Preservation Guide (CETESB 1998). For some \n\nanalyzes, samples were filtered through a 0.45 ?m filter, while for major cations were \n\nacidified with nitric acid to a pH of less than 2. All these samples were analyzed at \n\nthe Analytical Solution Company's laboratory, in S\u00e3o Paulo. \n\n \n\n3.3 Georeferencing data and software \n\n \n\nAll the information was entered in a GIS database and georeferenced in ArcGIS \n\n10.1 software. The coordinate system was the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) \n\nprojection, Zone 23, datum SAD 69, with units in meters.  \n\nA four-step process was used to convert all the maps data to digital form: (1) \n\nautomation: a scanned image of the original field map was vectorized, edited, and \n\nprocessed into arc, polygon, and point formats; (2) projection: digital files were \n\ntransformed from digitizer coordinates to real-world coordinates and converted to a \n\ncartographic projection; (3) tables: tables were created to hold label information for \n\npolygons, arcs, and points; and (4) symbology: symbols were added for each \n\ndifferent layers to indicate different information on the map plots. \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Materials and methods \n\nDoctoral Thesis 14 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nTo address areas with low data, and to help understand the spatial distribution \n\nof subsurface lithological contacts, as well as to understand the spatial concentration \n\nof some parameters, such as major ions or potentiometric surface, kriging \n\ninterpolations of the data were carried out in Surfer 8 software, drawing isopleths \n\nmaps. After that, these maps were visually improved in CorelDraw X3 software. \n\nFor geochemical samples, all the measurements were checked for accuracy by \n\ncalculating the mass balance, and then the water types were classified using the \n\nPiper's diagram of water (Piper 1944) at the AquaChem 4.0 software. For saturation \n\nindex of calcite and dolomite calculations, PHREEQCI software was used.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 4.

This is also where the field of karst science began \n\n(Van Beynen 2011). Jovan Cviji? (1865-1927) helped lay down the foundation for the \n\nmodern understanding of geomorphic processes in the late nineteenth century, \n\nwhere the karst science has expanded to include other types of karst, such as relict, \n\npaleokarst, fluviokarst, thermokarst, etc. (Ford and Williams 2007). Now in the \n\ntwenty-first century, the science of karst has greatly advanced, incorporating an \n\nimproved understanding of karst environments, their fragility, and their value to \n\nhuman development. \n\nRocks types potentially containing karst cover about 20% of the Earth\u2019s land \n\nsurface, especially those developed in carbonate rocks, such as limestone, dolomite, \n\nor gypsum (Fig. 5), where 20-25% of the global population depends largely, or \n\nentirely, on groundwater obtained from them (Ford and Williams 2007). In Brazil, it is \n\nestimated that between 5 - 7% of the total surface of the country is composed by \n\nkarst rocks (Karmann 1994), with the most extensive karst regions occurring in \n\ncentral Brazil, developed on Proterozoic and Lower Cambriam limestones and \n\ndolomites (Auler and Farrant 1996). Karst aquifers are extremely heterogeneous with \n\na distribution of permeability that spans many orders of magnitude. They often \n\ncontain open conduit flowpaths with hydraulic characteristics more like surface \n\nstreams than groundwater (White 2003).  \n\nThese resources are coming under increasing pressure and have great need of \n\nrehabilitation and sustainable management, so the knowledge of their properties is \n\nincreasingly important. The sections that follow will provide brief comments about the \n\nmost relevant concepts related to karst hydrogeological systems that were useful to \n\nthe development of this research and that may be useful for who will read this thesis \n\nas a reference for future works. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Karst hydrogeology: origins and concepts \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 17 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 5. Global distribution of major outcrops of carbonate rocks, where the black areas are \npure carbonates and the grey areas are impure carbonates (from Ford and Williams 2007). \nThe resulting karst terrain tends to have high numbers of caves and sinkholes. \n\n \n\n4.1 The origin of karst \n\n \n\nKarst is commonly considered as the result of the solution process of carbonate \n\nrocks, named \u201ckarstification\u201d. It occurs by chemical and, sometimes, mechanical \n\naction of water in a region generally of limestone, dolomite, or gypsum bedrock \n\n(Karamouz et al. 2011). The chemical composition of groundwater from these \n\nbedrocks is usually dominated by products from dissolution of carbonate minerals \n\nincluding calcite, aragonite and dolomite. The carbonate solution occurs because the \n\nwater is acidic when it contains dissolved CO2, according to the following \n\nstoichiometric equations (Goldscheider and Drew 2007): \n\n \n\nCO2 + H2O ? H2CO3          (1) \n\nH2CO3 ? HCO\n?\n\n3 + H\n+          \n\n(2) \n\nCaCO3 ? Ca\n2+\n\n + CO3\n2?          \n\n(3) \n\nCO3\n2?\n\n + H\n+\n ? HCO\n\n-\n3          (4) \n\n \n\nThe solubility product corresponding to reaction 3 is quite small. However, \n\nbecause the carbonate ion is \u201cremoved\u201d by protonation (equation 4), dissolution of \n\ncarbonate minerals can proceed to a significant extent, depending on the quantity of \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Karst hydrogeology: origins and concepts \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 18 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\ncarbonic acid that is available and delivers protons (equation 2). Equations 1 - 4 can \n\nbe summarized by equation 5: \n\n \n\n2H2O + CaCO3 + CO2 ? H2O + Ca\n2+\n\n + 2HCO\n-\n3      (5) \n\n \n\nBecause the concentration of dissolved CO2 is driven by both the temperature \n\nand the CO2 partial pressure of the atmosphere related to (ground) water, climate is \n\ngenerally considered as driving karst processes (Smith and Atkinson 1976, \n\nBakalowicz 1992). Presently, and for late geologic time, CO2 was only abundant in \n\nthe subsurface where it was produced either in soils by biological activity, or at depth \n\nby geological processes. Consequently, karst develops mainly with groundwater \n\nsolution of the carbonate rocks. \n\nIn fact, the solution of carbonate rocks proceeds only if groundwater flows, \n\nwhich export the products of dissolution creating underground voids. These voids \n\nprogressively organize into a hierarchical structure (the conduit system or karst \n\nnetwork) in the vadose and the phreatic zone. In it, pipe flow conditions prevail, either \n\nunder pressure or at atmospheric pressure. Therefore, groundwater flow determines \n\nthe hydrogeological structure of karst media, which in return creates an important \n\nfeedback effect modifying the flow conditions (White 2003). The orientation and \n\nextension of the flow system and conduit network may change with time, where \n\nconduits may collapse, or be filled with sediments, or saturated conduits may \n\ntransform into unsaturated conduits, or vice-versa (Goldscheider and Drew 2007). \n\nFor this, karst develops only if the following conditions occur: (1) the possibility \n\nof dissolving carbonate rock, i.e. the existence of a solvent; and (2) a groundwater \n\nflow, determined by a hydraulic gradient and geological discontinuities, such as joints \n\nand bedding planes, folds, or faults/fractures. These conditions result in aquifers in \n\nwhich there may be unexpected groundwater flow paths and drainage outlet points, \n\nwhich cannot be predicted on the basis of the present topographic and hydrologic \n\nsetting (White 2003, Goldscheider and Drew 2007). \n\n \n\n4.2 Features and controls on the development of karst system \n\n \n\nA karst region is usually formed by a set of phenomena, grouped into systems \n\nthat are formed because of the existence of smaller structures dominated by tectonic, \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Karst hydrogeology: origins and concepts \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 19 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nstratigraphic, and lithologic factors. These elements are divided into three groups: (1) \n\nthe epigenetic forms of absorption, where the infiltration of water in karst carves the \n\nkarst morphology; (2) the hypogenic forms, where the water circulates through \n\nunderground caves and other underground conduits; and (3) where the hypogenic \n\ncirculation returns to normal epigenetic way through surges. All karst system, in local \n\nor regional scale, could have these three types of karst forms characterizing the \n\n\"hydrogeological model\", with recharge, water circulation (and its heterogeneities) \n\nand discharge area (White 2003).  \n\nKir\u00e1ly (2002) pointed out that groundwater flow depends on hydraulic \n\nparameters and on boundary conditions and, consequently, that other factor, such as \n\ngeology, geomorphology, and climate, exert their influence on groundwater \n\nmovement solely through hydraulic parameter fields and boundary conditions. These \n\nessential components inside of a karst aquifer flow system will be discussed as \n\nfollowing. \n\n \n\n4.2.1 Recharge of karst aquifer (input control) \n\nA karst aquifer can be envisaged as an open system with a boundary defined \n\nby the catchment limits and with input, throughput and output flows, mechanisms and \n\ncontrols (Ford and Williams 2007). In the simplest case, there are different categories \n\nfor karst aquifer recharge. If the karst area recharges itself, it is called autogenic \n\nrecharge. Allogenic recharge occurs when the adjacent non-karst areas recharge the \n\nkarst aquifer (Goldscheider and Drew 2007).  \n\nWhereas autogenic recharge is often quite diffuse, down many fissures across \n\nthe karst outcrop, allogenic recharge normally occurs as concentrated point-inputs of \n\nsinking streams. Both the water chemistry and the recharge volume per unit area are \n\ndifferent in these two styles of recharge, with considerable consequences for the \n\nscale and distribution of the development of secondary permeability (Ford and \n\nWilliams 2007). \n\n \n\n4.2.2 Hydraulic parameters (throughput control) \n\n4.2.2.1 Permeability of karst aquifer  \n\nFormation bulk permeability depends on the shape, amount, distribution and \n\ninterconnectivity of void spaces, or permeability structure. The \"karstification\" of an \n\naquifer is in large part measured by its permeability distribution. For many years, this \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Karst hydrogeology: origins and concepts \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 20 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nhas been discussed in terms of the \"triple permeability\" model (White 2003), \n\nconsisting of: (1) matrix permeability of the bedrock itself (or primary porosity); (2) \n\nfracture permeability (or secondary porosity); and (3) conduit permeability (or tertiary \n\nporosity).  \n\nThe matrix permeability of many Paleozoic limestones and dolomites is very low \n\nand can often be ignored. Mezosoic limestones, such as those of Florida and the \n\nCaribbean islands may have very high matrix permeabilities. Fracture permeability \n\nrequires two parameters: the fracture aperture and the fracture spacing. Both are \n\nstatistical and have a range of values within the same aquifer. Fracture permeability \n\nis modified by solution so that fracture apertures range from tens or hundreds of \n\nmicrometers in unmodified limestone up to 10 millimeters. The latter is the aperture at \n\nwhich non-linear effects begin to appear in the flow field and marks a useful \n\nboundary between large fractures and very small conduits. Conduits can range in \n\nsize from 10 mm to tens (sometimes hundreds) of meters. Hydrologically, they \n\nbehave much as storm drains. In map view, conduits take on many different patterns \n\ndepending on local geology and various characteristics of the flow field itself. To \n\nunderstand the dynamics of a karst aquifer, then, it is necessary to understand the \n\nrate of recharge into the various components of the permeability and the exchange of \n\nwater between these components (White 2003, Ford and Williams 2007).  \n\nBecause of this triple permeability, karst limestones can lead to well-known \n\npermeability scale effects, which are generally defined as continual increases in \n\npermeability magnitude from small- to regional-scale estimates, which is probably \n\ncaused by fractures on the small-scale, and that the largest permeabilities on the \n\nregional-scale were caused by karstic conduits (Ratz 1967, Kir\u00e1ly 1975, Maclay and \n\nLand 1988, Halihan et al. 1999). According to Halihan et al. (2000), this increment in \n\npermeability can reach nine orders of magnitude variability. \n\n \n\n4.2.2.2 Transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity \n\nIn practical terms, the transmissivity equals the horizontal groundwater flow rate \n\nthrough a vertical strip of aquifer one unit wide. Transmissivity is directly proportional \n\nto aquifer thickness and hydraulic conductivity. However, the concept of \n\ntransmissivity in karst aquifers is not straight-forward: it is obvious that the \n\ntransmissive properties of conduits and channels, where the groundwater \n\npreferentially flows, are much higher than in the surrounding aquifer matrix. At the \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Karst hydrogeology: origins and concepts \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 21 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nsame time, the hydraulic conductivity has no real physical meaning in the case of \n\nconduit and channel flow; it is proportionality constant in Darcy\u2019s law, which was \n\nderived for intergranular porous media, and has the dimension of velocity. Although \n\nthe hydraulic conductivity has been used to calculate flow in all aquifer types, it \n\nshould be noted that in karst aquifers it represents a lumped parameter, which \n\ndescribes properties of an \u201cequivalent porous media\u201d. In other words, the hydraulic \n\nresponse of all porosity types, including conduits and karst channels, is described \n\nwith one parameter: an equivalent hydraulic conductivity (Goldscheider and Drew \n\n2007). \n\n \n\n4.2.2.3 Groundwater velocity \n\nBecause of widely varying hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity of karst \n\ncarbonates, even within the same aquifer system, the groundwater velocity in karst \n\ncan vary over many orders of magnitude. One should therefore be very careful when \n\nmaking a (surprisingly common) statement such as \u201cgroundwater velocity in karst is \n\ngenerally very high\u201d (Goldscheider and Drew 2007). Although this may be true for \n\nturbulent flow taking place in karst conduits, a disproportionably larger volume of any \n\nkarst aquifer \u201cexperiences\u201d relatively low groundwater velocities (laminar flow) \n\nthrough small fissures and rock matrix.  \n\nIt is interesting that, based on 281 dye tracing tests, the most frequent velocity \n\n(14% of all cases) in the classic Dinaric karst of Herzegovina, as reported by \n\nMilanovic (1979), is quite similar: between 864 and 1728 m/d. 25% of the results \n\nshow groundwater velocity greater than 2655 m/d in West Virginia, and greater than \n\n5184 m/d in Herzegovina.  \n\nConfined karst aquifers, which do not have major concentrated discharge points \n\nin forms of large springs, generally have much lower groundwater flow velocities. \n\nThis is regardless of the predominant porosity type because the whole system is \n\nunder pressure and the actual displacement of \u201cold\u201d aquifer water with the newly \n\nrecharged one is rather slow. Groundwater flow velocity estimates using carbon \n\nfourteen isotope dating for the confined portion of the Floridan aquifer in central \n\nFlorida (Hanshaw and Back 1974) showed that the average groundwater velocity \n\nbased on 40 values is 6.9 m/y or 0.019 m/d. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Karst hydrogeology: origins and concepts \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 22 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\n4.2.2.4 Groundwater flow \n\nFlow through fractures \n\nFracture aperture and thickness are two parameters used most often in various \n\nsingle-fracture flow equations, while spacing between the fractures and fracture \n\norientation is used when calculating flow through a set of fractures. However, these \n\nactual physical characteristics are not easily and meaningfully translated into \n\nequations attempting to describe flow at a realistic field scale (Goldscheider and \n\nDrew 2007): \n\n1) Fracture aperture is not constant and there are voids and very narrow or \n\ncontact areas called asperities. Various experimental studies have shown that the \n\nactual flow in a fracture is channeled through narrow, conduit-like tortuous paths and \n\ncannot be simply represented by the flow between two parallel plates separated by \n\nthe \u201cmean\u201d aperture (Cacas 1989); \n\n2) Because of stress release, the aperture measure at outcrops or in accessible \n\ncave passages is not the same as an in-situ aperture. Aperture measured on drill \n\ncores and in borings is also not a true one \u2013 the drilling process commonly causes \n\nbedrock adjacent to fractures to break out thereby increasing the apparent widths of \n\nfracture openings as viewed on borehole-wall images (Williams et al. 2001); \n\n3) Fractures have limited length and width, which can also vary between \n\nindividual fractures in the same fracture set. Spacing between individual fractures in \n\nthe same set can also vary. Since all these variations take place in the three-\n\ndimensional space, they cannot be directly observed, except through continuous \n\ncoring or logging of multiple closely spaced boreholes, which is the main cost-limiting \n\nfactor (Williams et al. 2001). \n\n \n\nFlow through conduits and channels \n\nFlow through conduits is generally described by the well-known Bernoulli \n\nequation for real viscous fluids. The total energy surface (E) of flow can only \n\ndecrease from the upgradient cross section towards the downgradient cross section \n\nof the same flow tube (conduit) due to energy losses. On the other hand, the \n\npiezometric surface (H) can go \u201cup\u201d and \u201cdown\u201d along the same flow tube depending \n\non the cross sectional area. The total energy surface, which includes the flow velocity \n\ncomponent (?v\n2\n/2g), can be directly measured only by the Pitot device whose \n\ninstallation is not feasible in most field conditions (Goldscheider and Drew 2007). \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Karst hydrogeology: origins and concepts \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 23 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nMonitoring wells and piezometers, on the other hand, only record the \n\npiezometric pressure (hydraulic head), which does not include the flow velocity \n\ncomponent. It is therefore conceivable that two piezometers in or near the same karst \n\nconduit with rapid flow may not provide useful information for calculation of the real \n\nflow velocity and flow rate between them, and may even falsely indicate the opposite \n\nflow direction. There are additional complicating factors when attempting to calculate \n\nflow through natural karst conduits using the pipe approach: (1) flow through the \n\nsame conduit may be both under the pressure and with the free surface; (2) since \n\nconduit walls are more or less irregular (\u201crough\u201d), the related coefficient of roughness \n\nhas to be estimated and inserted into the general flow equation; (3) conduit cross \n\nsection may vary significantly over short distances; and (4) the flow may be both \n\nlaminar and turbulent in the same conduit, depending on the flow velocity, cross-\n\nsectional area and wall roughness. The irregularities that cause turbulent flow are \n\nmathematically described through the Reynolds number and the friction factor. \n\n \n\n4.2.3 Discharge of karst aquifer (output control) \n\nMost of the largest springs in the world are karst springs (Ford and Williams \n\n2007). They represent the termination of underground river systems and mark the \n\npoint at which surface fluvial processes become dominant. The vertical position of the \n\nspring controls the elevation of the water table at the output of the aquifer, whereas \n\nthe hydraulic conductivity and throughput discharge determine the slope of the water \n\ntable upstream and its variation under different discharge conditions. \n\nA distinguishing feature of karst aquifers is that most of the groundwater is \n\ndischarged through a small number of large springs. In some aquifers, the entire \n\ndischarge is through a single spring. In other, there is a distributary system to a small \n\nnumber of springs. One or a few of these carry the base-flow discharge and are \n\ncalled \"underflow springs\", while other springs flow only during periods of high \n\ndischarge and are called \"overflow springs\" (Worthington 1991). The discharge from \n\nkarst springs is a composite of all water moving through the aquifer. The spring (or \n\nsprings), therefore, is an optimum location for measuring hydrographs, chemographs, \n\nand for monitoring the aquifer for contaminants. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Karst hydrogeology: origins and concepts \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 24 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\n4.3 Karst landform \n\n \n\nKarst landscapes form in areas with carbonate bedrock subjected to slow \n\ndissolution processes (Fleury 2009). These processes typically result in the formation \n\nof visible surface and subsurface features, including sinkholes, caves, and springs, \n\nwhere the water is the main agent of landscape altercation (Palmer 2007). \n\nSubsequently, the basic understanding of the most common karst landforms will be \n\ndiscussed. \n\n \n\n4.3.1 Sinkholes (Dolines) \n\nSinkholes, or dolines, are an extremely common type of karst landform, created \n\nby the subsidence of soils and rock at or near the land surface into empty space \n\nbelow (Fleury 2009). They are often located in areas where soluble rock is near the \n\nsurface, either completely exposed or beneath a layer of topsoil. Sinkhole \n\ndevelopment can be triggered by any mechanism that increases the head differential \n\nbetween the artesian water in the limestone and the perched water in the surface soil \n\n(Beck 1986), resulting in depressions with a shape of bowls or funnels. \n\nIn order to form a sinkhole, three requirements are needed (Fleury 2009): (1) a \n\ndrainage path for the surface water runoff to follow; (2) a zone of bedrock modified by \n\nsolution located at or near the surface; and (3) a covering of soil or some other \n\nmaterial making up the land surface.  \n\nWith some exceptions, sinkholes are generally not large landforms. However, \n\nthey are important to understand in the context of karst systems because they act as \n\nrecharge routes for the aquifer below. The fact that surface water receives no natural \n\nfiltering when entering a karst aquifer via sinkhole means that contaminants on the \n\nsurface are easily carried into the groundwater (White 1988). \n\n \n\n4.3.2 Caves \n\nCaves are generally a natural opening in the earth that is large enough to be \n\nentered by a human (White 1988, Palmer 2007). Usually, cave systems are the result \n\nof a succession of active conduit networks that evolve through time (Klimchouk et al. \n\n2000). It has been demonstrated that phreatic conduit systems may develop within a \n\nfew thousand years if recharge is sufficient (Palmer 2000), especially if initial \n\nopenings are wide enough (>0.1 mm). In many mountainous karst areas, those \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Karst hydrogeology: origins and concepts \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 25 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nconditions are fulfilled, and active conduits normally are located close to the valley \n\nbottoms. In mountain ranges, it can be assumed that uplift is more or less \n\ncompensated for by the entrenchment of valleys, therefore new conduits have to form \n\neach time the valley floor is entrenched further, previous (higher-level) conduits \n\nbecome only temporarily active, and later are eventually permanently abandoned by \n\nthe water. Most of the caves explored by cavers are part of those dry (fossil) \n\nsystems. This simple model may be more complex if, for any reason, the base level \n\nwas raised at any time in the past (Audra et al. 2004). \n\n \n\n4.3.3 Springs \n\nSprings are formed at the spots where karst waters emerge from the local \n\nunderground drainage system. They can be found on the surface or in caves and are \n\noften used as sources of drinking water and as recreation areas (Fleury 2009). Their \n\nformation is a direct result of carbonate rock dissolution, creating large conduits and \n\ncaves that can then channel groundwater up to the land surface. Springs can serve \n\nas hydrogeological trend indicators and are very stable in terms of water quality, \n\ntemperature and flow, though even short-term variation in rainfall can be reflected by \n\na spring's flow (Field 2002).  \n\n \n\n4.3.4 Poljes \n\nPoljes - the largest karst hollows - are wide, closed depressions with flat floors, \n\nwhich are often adjacent to steep enclosing walls. They require extremely thick and \n\ngeographically extensive carbonate bedrock to form at all. Poljes have their own \n\ninternal drainage systems and often have complex hydrogeological characteristics, \n\nincluding shallows holes and disappearing streams (Field 2002). \n\n \n\n4.3.5 Karst valleys \n\nKarst valleys form when a developing underground drainage system diverts \n\nwater away from the rivers feeding into the valley. They have all the properties of a \n\nstream valley except the stream itself, being more common in areas of flat, \n\ninterbedded layers of limestone, sandstone and shale (White 1988). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Karst hydrogeology: origins and concepts \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 26 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\n4.3.6 Sinking streams \n\nThey are surface features that direct runoff into an underground channel, in \n\nother words, they are sinkholes that form in a stream bed, often with a large vertical \n\nshaft beneath (Ford and Williams 2007).  \n\n \n\n4.4 Human impacts on karst system  \n\n \n\nKarst environments are particularly fragile and vulnerable to damage compared \n\nwith most other natural systems. The reason for this is the nature of the karst \n\nhydrological system. Efficient drainage of the surface down numerous widened joints, \n\ndolines, and sinkholes rapidly transmits surface pollution underground and readily \n\nevacuates soils stripped from the surface. Filtration of diffuse recharge is minimal \n\nbecause limestone soils are usually thin, while transmission of recharge is essentially \n\nunfiltered because subterranean conduits have large dimensions and rapid \n\ntransmission provides minimal opportunity for die-off of pathogenic organisms (Ford \n\nand Williams 2007).  \n\nThus, it is a fact that karst areas are highly vulnerable to overuse and misuse, \n\nhaving major subterranean components that require specialist knowledge to manage \n\nproperly and, once damaged, can be extremely difficult to protect and restore. \n\nBecause of this vulnerability, karst areas can be impacted in form of deforestation, \n\nagricultural activity, or rocky desertification, as well as subsidences induced by \n\ndewatering, constructions, or groundwater contaminations. Here, emphasis will be \n\ngiven to induced sinkholes and groundwater contamination, considering these \n\nimpacts are more common in the study area of this thesis. \n\n \n\n4.4.1 Groundwater contamination in karst aquifer \n\nKarst aquifers are particularly vulnerable to contamination: due to thin soils, flow \n\nconcentration in the epikarst (the uppermost, often intensively fractured and karstified \n\nlayer of a carbonate aquifer), and point recharge via swallow holes, contaminants can \n\neasily reach the groundwater, where they may be transported rapidly in karst \n\nconduits over large distances. The residence times of contaminants are often short \n\nand processes of contaminant attenuation, therefore, often do not work effectively in \n\nkarst systems. Karst aquifers, consequently, need special protection. However, \n\nprotection zoning for karst is more complicated than for granular aquifers, because \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Karst hydrogeology: origins and concepts \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 27 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nkarst systems are highly heterogeneous and anisotropic, the catchments may cover \n\nlarge areas and flow velocities may be as high as 500 m/h (Goldscheider and Drew \n\n2007). \n\nMany serious problems of human impacts on waters emphatically do exist, even \n\nif they are not obvious to the casual observer. Water contamination may be \n\ntransmitted into karst by both allogenic and autogenic sources. In the autogenic \n\ncontext, contamination can arise from both dispersed and point sources. Dispersed-\n\nsource contamination enters the epikarst before being transmitted to the phreatic \n\nzone, whereas point-source contamination normally bypass the epikarst, typically \n\ndown doline drains, and is rapidly transmitted to the water table (Ford and Williams \n\n2007). \n\nSome cities built in carbonate rocks, especially in developing countries, have \n\nlimited or no sewer systems. Consequently, considerable municipal and industrial \n\nwaste has been and, in many cases, still is being discharged into karst without \n\ntreatment, giving rise to many water quality problems. As a result, the presence of \n\nhigh nitrate concentrations are present in urban areas (indication of an inefficient \n\nmanagement of domestic sanitation systems) in groundwater (Foster and Hirata \n\n1987), exceeding all federal and state drinking water quality requirements. In \n\nagricultural areas, the most common is the contamination of pesticide and fertilizers, \n\nwhile in industrial zones, high concentrations of DNAPL (dense, non-aqueous phase \n\nliquids), LNAPL (light, non-aqueous phase liquids), and metals (chromium, nickel, \n\ncadmium and mercury) are more common (Ford and Williams 2007). All those \n\nelements can result in poor drinking water quality, loss of water supply, degraded \n\nsurface water systems, high cleanup costs, high costs for alternative water supplies \n\n(specially in karst aquifers because of its inherent heterogeneities), and/or potential \n\nhealth problems. \n\n  \n\n4.4.2 Induced subsidences \n\nAfter groundwater pollution, induced subsidences, a geotechnical problem, such \n\nas sinkholes and collapses, are the most prominent hazardous effect of human \n\nactivity in karst regions. Agriculture, mining and quarrying, highways and railways, \n\nurban and industrial constructions all contribute. In 99% of reported cases or more \n\nevents occur in an overburden of unconsolidated cover sands, silts or clays (Ford \n\nand Williams 2007). \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Karst hydrogeology: origins and concepts \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 28 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nThese events can occur naturally (by dissolution of rock, or through the failure \n\nof a bedrock roof overlying a cave), or can be induced or accelerated by human \n\nactivities, which are commonly characterized by catastrophic collapse (Newton 1976, \n\nLaMoreaux and Newton 1986, LaMoreaux 1997). The formation of both of these \n\ntypes of geotechnical issues generally occur over periods of geologic time, not within \n\na human lifetime in carbonate formations. Therefore, it is important to emphasize that \n\nthe differences between both natural and anthropogenic situations is the speed at \n\nwhich the collapse processes begin, which is accelerated in an anthropogenic \n\nsituation (Albrecht 1996). \n\nThe induced geotechnical problems in these settings commonly form because \n\nof groundwater withdrawal, construction activities, or a combination of both (Newton \n\n1987, Bell 1997). In the case of groundwater withdrawal in an urban aquifer, periods \n\nof drought are the most dangerous, corresponding increased demand for \n\ngroundwater, leading to the formation of enlarged cones of depression (Oliveira \n\n1997). Within these cones of depression, wells, springs, and streams can go dry or \n\nhave their flows significantly reduced with the overall direction of groundwater flow \n\nbeing changed inducing geotechnical problems (Hobbs and Gunn 1998).  \n\n \n\n4.5 Isotopes and significance to karst hydrology \n\n \n\nKarst groundwaters can be characterized by natural or anthropogenic tracers \n\nincluding isotopes, hydrochemical constituents, and artificial tracers, such as \n\nfluorescent dyes (Goldscheider and Drew 2007). Isotopic data elucidate the origin \n\nand age of karst waters and the rocks that enclose them, and show that mixing and \n\ncarbonate reactivity are major variables. Hydrogen, carbon and oxygen are the \n\ndominant constituents in karst waters, karst bedrock, speleothems, travertine \n\ndeposits, and in dissolved bicarbonate, which is normally the dominant anion in karst \n\nwater. Fortunately, these elements all include stable isotopes that exhibit variations \n\nlarge enough to be routinely measured with mass spectrometers. In the case of this \n\nthesis, the stable isotopes hydrogen and oxygen were used for tracking the origin of \n\nwater and its subsequent movement.  \n\nPhysically, the stable isotopes are atoms that take the same position in the \n\ntable of elements, but have a different number of neutrons and, therefore, mass. The \n\nmost relevant isotopes for atmospheric and hydrologic sciences are \n18\n\nO for oxygen \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Karst hydrogeology: origins and concepts \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 29 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\n(corresponding to the most abundant isotope \n16\n\nO), and \n2\nH (or Deuterium, D) for \n\nhydrogen (corresponding to the most abundant isotope \n1\nH) (Gat 1996, Mook 2001).  \n\nThese isotopes, during evaporation and condensation phases, become \n\nenriched in one phase and depleted in the other. This separation of isotopes is \n\nnamed isotopic fractionation (Mook 2001), and quantifying these processes is \n\npossible by calculating the large variability of their isotopic ratios (\n2\nH/H and \n\n18\nO/\n\n16\nO).  \n\nMeasurements of stable isotopes also require a common standard. For \n\natmospheric applications, the usual standard is the Vienna Standard Mean Ocean \n\nWater (V-SMOW), published and distributed regularly by the International Atomic \n\nEnergy Agency (IAEA). The delta (?) notation is used to quantify stable isotope as \n\nrelative ratios and the isotopes values are reported in per mil (\u2030) to make it easy to \n\ncompare significant results. \n\nDifferent results from the standard V-SMOW provide information about recharge \n\nand discharge processes; flow, mixing and interconnections between aquifers; \n\nevaporation; marine influence; and the sources and mechanism of pollution (Clark \n\nand Fritz 1997).  \n\nCraig (1961) observed that the ?\n 18\n\nO and ?\n 2\n\nH values of precipitation that have \n\nnot been evaporated are linearly related by the equation ?\n2\nH = 8 ?\n\n18\nO + 10. This \n\nequation, known as the Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL), is based on \n\nprecipitation data from locations around the globe, and has an r\n2\n > 0.95. This high \n\ncorrelation coefficient reflects the fact that the oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopes \n\nin water molecules are intimately associated. The slope and intercept of any Local \n\nMeteoric Water Line (LMWL), which is the line derived from precipitation collected \n\nfrom a single site or set of \"local\" sites, can be significantly different from the GMWL. \n\n A GMWL reported by Rozansky (1993) related by the equation ?\n2\nH = 8.17?\n\n18\nO \n\n+ 11.27 is an enhancement to the meteoric water line proposed by Craig (1961) \n\nhaving much more data included, which can provide more accuracy in the meteoric \n\nwater line.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Karst hydrogeology: origins and concepts \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 30 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \nAlbrecht KJ (1996) Evaluation of geological and geotechnical problems in karst land - Basis for \n\ngeotechnical mapping.

Introduction \n\n  \n\nThe study area is located in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, among the municipalities of Pedro \n\nLeopoldo, Matozinhos, and Sete Lagoas, with Velhas River as the eastern boundary (Fig. 1). \n\nGeologically, this area is located in the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton, where carbonated argillo-arenaceous \n\nsediments are emplaced giving origin to the Bambu\u00ed Group, deposited in an epicontinental shelf in the \n\nS\u00e3o Francisco Basin. The geologic particularities provide important economic resources to the region, \n\nwhich have driven the economic development and population increase with the municipality of Sete \n\nLagoas at the forefront. There is a considerable industrial, mineral, and metallurgical center in this \n\nregion situated mainly along the main federal highway, which is a corridor of significant growth.  \n\nThe previous studies about the Bambu\u00ed Group were carried out by Branco and Costa (1961), \n\nwho proposed the first stratigraphic column of the region, later modified by Oliveira (1967), Sch\u00f6ll \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Geologic conceptual model of Sete Lagoas and the surroundings  \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 33 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\n(1973), Dardenne (1978) and, finally, by Ribeiro et al. (2003). In addition, other important studies \n\nrelated to structural (Magalh\u00e3es 1989), geochronological (Babinski and Kaufman 2003), \n\nhydrogeological (Pessoa 1996, 2005), and geological evolution (Nobre-Lopes 1995, Uhlein et al. \n\n2004, Tuller et al. 2009) were carried out. Despite the geologic knowledge being well developed, the \n\narea needs work on integration and detailing of the geologic information. Thus, the primary goal of this \n\npaper was to contribute to the quality of the geologic cartography, as well as the spatial arrangement, \n\nand the structural framework of the lithologies found in this region. Aerial photography, geologic \n\nmapping, and the evaluation of 270 lithological well profiles located in Sete Lagoas and in the adjacent \n\nmunicipalities were integrated with the available data to provide a new geologic perspective of the \n\nregion. As a result, the update to the geologic map of the municipality of Sete Lagoas, 14 geologic \n\ncross sections, and a geologic conceptual model were created.  \n\n \n\n2. Site description \n\n \n\nThe study area (Fig. 1) overlies the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton (Almeida 1977), which is represented \n\nby crystalline rocks from the Paleoproterozoic age formed by the agglutination of different craton \n\nblocks from the Archean age. Extension events occurred between 900 and 600 Ma. (Condie 2002) \n\nallowing Neoproterozoic silicate-carbonate sediments from the Bambu\u00ed Group to be deposited.  \n\nRegionally, the Bambu\u00ed Group is about 300,000 km\n2\n (Almeida 1977), including mainly the states \n\nof Minas Gerais, Goi\u00e1s, and Bahia. The basement being controlled by a faulting system causing the \n\nthickness of the sediments to be variable (Misi et al. 2007). According to seismic surveys conducted \n\nby Petrobras S.A., the central area of this group can have a thickness of 1,000 m, while in the \n\nmunicipality of Sete Lagoas it is estimated to 600 m thick on average (Pedrosa-Soares et al. 1994).  \n\nThe sediments of the Bambu\u00ed Group were deposited in a low gradient stable epicontinental \n\nshelf in shallow water conditions, which explains a regional occurrence of the lithofacies. \n\n(Schobbenhaus 1984). Stratigraphically, there were three regressive sedimentary mega-cycles: (1) \n\ncarbonated (Sete Lagoas Formation); (2) argillo-carbonated (Serra de Santa Helena and Lagoa do \n\nJacar\u00e9 formations); and (3) argillo-arenaceous (Serra da Saudade and Tr\u00eas Marias formations).  \n\nThe Bambu\u00ed Group is represented by the following formations, from the base to the top: \n\nCarrancas (diamictites, sandstones, and rhythmites); Sete Lagoas (carbonate sequence); Serra de \n\nSanta Helena (siltstones, phyllites, slate, arkose, and marlstones), Lagoa do Jacar\u00e9 (oolitic \n\nlimestones); Serra da Saudade (siltstones, sands, and sandstones); and Tr\u00eas Marias (fluvial platform \n\nsandstones) (Tuller et al. 2009). \n\nThe basement is represented by gneissic rocks associated with granitoids and migmatite zones \n\nfrom the Belo Horizonte Complex. Overlying the Bambu\u00ed Group, are the unconsolidated sediments \n\nfrom Cenozoic surface coverage (Tuller et al. 2009). The Bambu\u00ed Group is represented by the \n\nfollowing formations, associated with mega-cycles 1 and 2 (Fig. 1):  \n\n1) Sete Lagoas Formation (Dardenne 1978): overlies the Carrancas Formation in some areas, \n\nor may have direct contact with the basement. The ages range from 740\u00b122 Ma. old, based on data \n\nfrom Pb-Pb analysis (Babinski et al. 2007), to 630 Ma., by C-O-Sr data (Caxito et al 2012), or 540 Ma., \n\nthrough paleontology investigations (Warren et al 2014). Three carbonate depositional systems are \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Geologic conceptual model of Sete Lagoas and the surroundings  \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 34 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nrecognized (Lima 1997): (1) internal ramp; (2) intermediary ramp; and (3) external ramp deposits; \n\ncharacterized by a shallowing upward cycle. This formation is divided and characterized by two \n\nmembers (Ribeiro et al. 2003): Pedro Leopoldo, at the base, composed of fine grained white \n\nlimestones, dolomites, marlstones, and pelites; and Lagoa Santa, on the top, by medium grained black \n\nlimestones;  \n\n2) Serra de Santa Helena Formation (Costa and Branco 1961): having an area greater than \n\n7,000 km\u00b2 and represented by three stratigraphic members (Grossi Sad et al. 1998): (1) lower, \n\ncharacterized by silt-clay rhythmites, generally carbonaceous, and dark shales (about 90 m thickness); \n\n(2) medium, composed of marble and shales (50 m thick); and (3) upper, consisting of shales, \n\nsiltstones, slate cleavage, and cross bedding (around 140 m thick).  \n\nRegarding the structural geology, the main planar structures are faults, foliations and fractures, \n\nconsisting of two types of faults (Danderfer Filho 1991, Tuller et al. 2009): normal and thrust, trending \n\nNNW-SSE. Kinematic indicators, such as stretching and mineral lineations, indicate tectonic transport \n\nfrom east to west, forming interstratal ramp thrust belts, accommodated in more argillous upper \n\nplanes. The first generation of the structures is composed of normal synsedimentary faults. Based on \n\nstructural surveys, the Bambu\u00ed Group is divided into four structural domains, according to the \n\nmagnitude of the deformation (Tuller et al. 2009): (1) high intensity of deformation domain, where \n\nrocks from the Espinha\u00e7o Supergroup outcrop. The presence of mass transport commonly indicates \n\nmovement from east to west; (2) intermediate domain, characterized by less intense deformation, \n\nmore deformed to the east and less deformed to the west; (3) domain where the Bambu\u00ed Group rocks \n\nare presented less deformed to not deformed; and (4) domain less deformed at the far west portion of \n\nthe area, affecting mainly the rocks from the Serra da Saudade Formation.  \n\nThe study area is located only in the intermediate structural domain, extending from Velhas \n\nRiver to the far western border of the municipality of Sete Lagoas.  \n\n \n\n3. Methods \n\n \n\nThree sets of data were integrated to evaluate the geologic setting of the region. These included \n\ngeologic mapping, aerial photography interpretation, and lithologic well log analysis. These methods \n\nwill be presented sequentially followed by the approach to data integration. \n\nGeologic mapping of the entire municipality of Sete Lagoas was carried out in a scale of \n\n1:25,000. The classification of the sedimentary rocks followed the definitions of Folk (1980) and the \n\nmicroscopic classification of the carbonate rocks followed the definitions of Folk (1959) and Dunham \n\n(1962). For the metamorphic and igneous rocks, the classification followed definitions of Winter \n\n(2001). All the data were recorded on paper topographic maps and converted to digital format. ArcGIS \n\n10.1 was used throughout the project to construct the digital map. Later, integration of the field data \n\nand the sheet geologic maps Baldim (SE.23-Z-C-III), Sete Lagoas (SE.23-Z-C-II), Contagem (SE.23-\n\nZ-C-V), and Belo Horizonte (SE.23-Z-C-VI), scale 1:100,000, was performed. These maps were \n\nacquired from the CPRM database, available on: http://geobank.sa.cprm.gov.br/.  \n\n   \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Geologic conceptual model of Sete Lagoas and the surroundings  \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 35 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 1.

A serie of 218 lithologic well profiles were acquired, located in the \n\nmunicipalities of Baldim, Caetan\u00f3polis, Capim Branco, Cordisburgo, Esmeralda, Fortuna de Minas, \n\nFunil\u00e2ndia, Inha\u00fama, Inimutaba, Lagoa Santa, Maravilhas, Matozinhos, Papagaio, Paraobepa, Pedro \n\nLeopoldo, Prudente de Morais, S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 da Lapa, and Sete Lagoas. In addition, 52 public well logs \n\nlocated in Sete Lagoas were analyzed, kindly provided by Water Supply and Sewage Service \n\ndatabase (SAAE) [SAAE -Servi\u00e7o de Abastecimento de \u00c1gua e Esgoto]. Out of the 270 lithologic well \n\nprofiles that were analyzed, the best and the most reliable were chosen.  \n\nIn order to help understand the areas where data were sparse, and thus estimate the geologic \n\ncontact depth, kriging interpolations of the data were carried out in Surfer 8 software. \n\nThe complete data sets were entered in a GIS database and georeferenced in ArcGIS 10.1 \n\nsoftware. The coordinate system was Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection, Zone 23, \n\ndatum SAD 69, with units in meters.  \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Geologic conceptual model of Sete Lagoas and the surroundings  \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 36 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nFinally, 14 geologic cross sections were made (NW-SE and NE-SW), at a scale of 1:25,000, \n\nwithin the municipality of Sete Lagoas, and a scale of 1:100,000 in the surrounding areas. The \n\ntopographic elevations were extracted from the SRTM image, using the Global Mapper 11 software. \n\n \n\n4. Results and discussions \n\n \n\n4.1. Geologic mapping \n\n \n\nThe lithologies found were the basement rocks from the Belo Horizonte Complex, the carbonate \n\nsequence from the Sete Lagoas Formation, the fine grained clastic rocks from the Serra de Santa \n\nHelena Formation, and the unconsolidated sediments from the Cenozoic surface coverage. Rocks \n\nfrom the Carrancas Formation (diamictites, sandstones, and rhythmites), stratigraphically below the \n\nSete Lagoas Formation, were not identified and mapped within the study area, but were mapped over \n\nthe southeast and northwest of the area by Ribeiro et al. (2003) and Tuller et al. (2009). In the case of \n\nthe Lagoa do Jacar\u00e9 Formation, these oolitic limestone rocks, with a mean thickness of 25 m, can be \n\nfound in the far northwest portion of the area and it is more detailed by Tuller et al. (2009). \n\n \n\n4.1.1. Belo Horizonte Complex \n\nThis igneous/metamorphic basement complex occurs in the SW and SE regions of the area \n\n(Fig. 6). It is characterized by a set of gneissic rocks and migmatite zones, with polymetamorphic \n\nfeatures, corresponding to the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton (Ribeiro et al. 2003). The contacts between the \n\ndifferent lithotypes are transitional, between gneiss, migmatites and/or granitoids. Stretched minerals \n\nare common, with presence of concordant shearing zones, layers and/or lengthened veins, many \n\ntimes boudinaged. The granitoids are light gray to whitish, with medium to coarse grained, sometimes \n\nwith sparse porphyroblasts of tabular feldspars, xenoliths, or restites from partial fusion. \n\nPetrographically, they vary in composition with hornblende gneisses, biotite gneisses, or amphibole \n\ngneisses, whose protolytes would be granites and tonalites, subjected to a metamorphism of the \n\namphibole facies, with hydrothermal alteration (Tuller et al. 2009). This complex was intensely affected \n\nby basic injections, resulting in a group of basic rock dikes (Ribeiro et al. 2003). In the south portion of \n\nSete Lagoas, epigenic and igneous metamorphic/migmatite rocks with plutonic feature are common \n\n(Fig. 2), as well as intrusions of mafic rocks, filling the fracture planes. Schistosity and transposition \n\nfoliation are also observed. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Geologic conceptual model of Sete Lagoas and the surroundings  \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 37 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 2. Gneiss-migmatite rock outcrop (left, UTM: 570178/7843865), and mesoscopic migmatite feature \n(right, UTM: 570183/7843875). \n\n \n\n4.1.2. Sete Lagoas Formation \n\nThis limestone occurs mainly in the SE region of the area. In the municipality of Sete Lagoas, it \n\noccurs in the central and western portions, and in the Santa Helena Ridge foothills (Fig. 6). The lower \n\ncontact with the basement is abrupt, discordant, and tectonic, with faults. The upper contact with the \n\nSerra de Santa Helena Formation is also abrupt (Figs. 9 and 10).  \n\nThe Sete Lagoas Formation is divided by two members: Pedro Leopoldo, at the base, \n\ncomposed of fine grained white limestones, dolomites, marlstones and pelites; and Lagoa Santa, on \n\nthe top, composed of medium grained black limestones. \n\nAccording to Vieira et al. (2007), there are six lithological facies, four in the Pedro Leopoldo \n\nMember and two in the Lagoa Santa Member: Facies 1, characterized by light gray to beige calcilutite, \n\nwith intercalations of yellowish pelite and truncated wave-ripple stratification, and tidal plain \n\nsedimentation environment, with possible storm influence; Facies 2, with aragonite crystals, \n\nconstituting tabular beds and/or layers of sea sedimentation in deep waters; Facies 3, constituted by \n\ndolomite rocks, which are disposed in overlaid benches with metric to sub-metric thickness; Facies 4, \n\nbeige to light gray calcilutites, plane-parallel stratification, with rithmite terrigenous and carbonate \n\nsedimentation, suggesting calm to slightly agitated waters sedimentation; Facies 5, characterized by \n\nblack calcarenites and calcisiltites, plane-parallel lamination, wave truncation, medium sized crossed \n\nstratifications; and Facies 6, represented by well preserved stromatolites, from a tidal flat environment.  \n\nIn relation to the lithological facies mentioned above, 3 of the 4 facies in the Pedro Leopoldo \n\nMember were confirmed:  \n\n1) Facies 1: located in the Cana\u00e3 quarry (near the Federal Road Police post, BR-040). It has a \n\ndecametric thickness of approximately 40 meters, represented by micritic limestone with medium to \n\ndark gray recrystallized sparite grains. The occurrence of meter-scale recumbent bends is common, \n\nwith recrystallization and intergrowth of calcite minerals parallel to the bedding, especially in joints; \n\n2) Facies 2: located in the Ilcon quarry (South-East of the municipality of Sete Lagoas). It is \n\ncharacterized by regular and homogeneous intercalation of micritic stratums, with thicknesses of 15 - \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Geologic conceptual model of Sete Lagoas and the surroundings  \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 38 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\n20 cm, and an intercalation of marlstone levels with brown-pink color, with terrigenous grain sizes. \n\nOccurrence of euhedral millimetric pyrite grains is also observed, with well developed cubic form;  \n\n3) Facies 3: located in the Sambra, Para\u00edso, Cap\u00e3o do Meio quarries, and in the Cap\u00e3o do \n\nInferno farm. Described as micritic rock, with occurrence of chlorite placoid minerals, and well-\n\ndeveloped bedding planes. The presence of pseudomorph aragonite arborescentes, with reddish \n\ncolor, recovered with cream colored micrite are observed.  \n\nThis Member presents important dissolution developed either in bedding planes (most frequent) \n\nand in sub-vertical fractures (less common), which are filled with terrigenous material (Fig. 3). \n\n \n\nFig. 3. Subvertical fractures (left, UTM: 565445/7851910) and bedding plane dissolution, most \nfrequently observed, filling with terrigenous sediments (right, UTM: 563101/7853620). \n \n\nIn relation to the lithological facies seen in the Lagoa Santa Member: \n\n1) Facies 5: rock with variable character, between gray micro-sparites and calcarenites, plane-\n\nparallel laminate;  \n\n2) Facies 6: occurrence of stromatolite layers, type gyminosolens (Marchese 1974) (Fig. 4).  \n\nThis Member presents important dissolution resulting in caves and grottoes (Fig. 4). \n\nMicroscopically, the limestones from Pedro Leopoldo Member are composed of 85% micrite, \n\n8% sparite, and 7% quartz, classified as micrite (Folk 1959) or mudstone (Dunham 1962). The \n\nlimestones from Lagoa Santa Member are 55 % sparite, 30 % ooids, and 15 % micrite, classified as \n\nan oobiosparite (Folk 1959) or grainstone (Dunham 1962). \n\n \n\nFig. 4. Caves or grottoes in the Lagoa Santa Member (left; UTM: 571617/7850185), characterized by \ncalcarenites rich in ooids (biosparites/grainstone, right, UTM: 571750/7847050). \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Geologic conceptual model of Sete Lagoas and the surroundings  \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 39 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\n4.1.3. Serra de Santa Helena Formation \n\nThis fine grained clastic formation occurs in the N, NE, NW regions (Fig. 6). It overlays the Sete \n\nLagoas Formation with abrupt, tectonic, or occasionally, gradational contacts. The basement contacts \n\nare abrupt and discordant due to thrust faults apparent on the basin's border. The overlaying Lagoa do \n\nJacar\u00e9 and Serra da Saudade formations are characterized by transitional contacts and can be locally \n\nabrupt (Tuller et al. 2009) (Figs. 9 and 10). This formation presents schistosity type foliation, \n\ndiscordant and/or concordant with the bedding. This whole sequence is cut by abundant bended \n\nquartz-feldspar veins, usually filling fractures or relief zones, generated during extensional events \n\n(Tuller et al. 2009). \n\nIn Sete Lagoas, it was possible to see intercalated levels of slate rocks with well-developed \n\ncleavage planes in thin layers, presenting gray-greenish sericite. Locally, less developed cubic grains \n\nof pyrite may occur. At the base, slate, siltstone, and argillite are found, very friable. Vertical fractures \n\nfilled with quartz veins with well-developed hexagonal forms (Fig. 5) and, locally, pegmatite veins, rich \n\nin feldspar and calcitite grains were also observed. \n\n \n\nFig. 4. Quartz veins in subvertical fracture systems in phyllites layers (top of the Santa Helena Ridge - \nleft, UTM: 577708/7852972) and slate with a well-developed rock cleavage coincident to the bedding \nplanes (right, UTM: 576695/7852000). \n\n \n\n4.1.4. Cenozoic Surface Coverage \n\nThis unit (Fig. 6) is divided into (1) detritus coverage, (2) alluvial terraces, and (3) alluviums. The \n\ndetritus coverage is composed by unconsolidated sediments with predominant red color, arenaceous-\n\nargillous with levels of gravel, which occur indistinctly on all units, but mainly on the rocks from the \n\nSerra de Santa Helena Formation. The alluvial terraces occur along the larger streams and rivers in \n\nthe area, such as the Velhas River and its effluents. They are up to 5 m thick and mainly consist of \n\nargillo-arenaceous semi-consolidated sediments, with whitish to yellowish and reddish color. Finally, \n\nthe alluviums occur along the meanders of the big watercourses. They are composed of fine to coarse \n\ngrained sediments, with discontinuous levels of quartz pebbles, in general rounded and not well \n\nsorted, and siltstone and sandstone placoids.  \n\nIn Sete Lagoas, the pedogenic features observed were: (1) nitosoil: argillo-arenaceous grains, \n\nbrown-reddish color and \u201cblock\u201d form. Its breaking plane presents a feature known as \u201ccerosity\u201d, a \n\nresult from the concentration of argillous grains; (2) detritus-laterite: rich in mature quartz fragments \n\nand pebbles, cemented by a white-yellowish siltic-argillous matrix; (3) agrisol: well developed horizons, \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Geologic conceptual model of Sete Lagoas and the surroundings  \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 40 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nwith well selected clay grains (at the base), grading for arenaceous grains, also with well selected \n\ngrains on the top; (4) latosoil: fine to coarse grains, with well cemented grains by the occurrence of \n\naggregated oxides and clay, in addition to having red-yellowish color; (5) neosoil: low diagenetic \n\ndegree, argillous matrix supporting the grains varying among sand, pebble and boulder; and (6) \n\nalluvial  soil: constituted of alluvial argillo-arenaceous grains, carried by a fluvial body, and it may vary \n\nto argillo-silty. \n\n \n\nFig. 6. Geologic map of the municipality of Sete Lagoas and the surroundings. The Belo Horizonte \nComplex (gneiss associated to granitoids) occurs in the SSW area. The Sete Lagoas Formation, \ndivided by two members (Pedro Leopoldo: fine white limestones; and Lagoa Santa: medium grained \nblack limestones) occurs mainly in the SE, W, and in the Santa Helena ridge foothills. The Serra de \nSanta Helena Formation (shales, siltstones, and slate) occurs in the NW, N, and NE regions, while the \nunconsolidated sediments from Cenozoic surface coverage occur along the large meanders and \ndrainages. The structural information can be seen separately in the Fig. 11. \n \n\n4.2. Structural geology  \n\n \n\nIncluded in the intermediate structural domain with low intensity of deformation (Tuller et al. \n\n2009), within the municipality of Sete Lagoas, no lithostructural contacts with thrust features were \n\nseen, and only abrupt deposition contacts were noted. However, from the lithologic well profiles, \n\nabrupt changes of depth to the basement were observed. In addition, similar basement level changes \n\nwere observed between its outcrops and the adjacent lithologic well profiles. From these data, it is \n\nsuggested that faults displaced the lower stratigraphic sequences, placing them in contact with upper \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Geologic conceptual model of Sete Lagoas and the surroundings  \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 41 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nblocks, which was observed in previous studies, in the eastern most portion of the area, out of the \n\nmunicipality Sete Lagoas.  \n\nThe upper contact between Sete Lagoas and Serra de Santa Helena formations and Belo \n\nHorizonte Complex is abrupt, with a low angle. It is preferably developed in bedding rocks, associated \n\nwith slate and phyllite from the Serra de Santa Helena Formation, and to the ductile-ruptile behavior \n\nphases of the limestone from Sete Lagoas Formation, locally represented by kink bands. In the case \n\nof Sete Lagoas Formation, the contact between Pedro Leopoldo (basal) and Lagoa Santa (upper) \n\nmembers is also abrupt, horizontal and well defined, which was confirmed in all quarry outcrops. \n\nSigmoidal deformations were observed specifically in the Lagoa Santa Member, suggesting a stage \n\nwhere the formation was deformed in a ductile regimen (Fig. 7).  \n\nThe main structures observed in the municipality of Sete Lagoas were fractures, folds, bedding \n\nplanes, and foliations (Fig. 8). The only observed evidence of microfaulting was seen in the Serra de \n\nSanta Helena Formation, with displacement of a few millimeters, located on the top of the Santa \n\nHelena Ridge. For the Belo Horizonte Complex, sub-vertical fracture planes are common, with \n\nNNW/SSE direction, and main attitude N347/83.  \n\nIn the case of the Sete Lagoas Formation, in the Pedro Leopoldo Member, the bedding planes \n\npresented a main orientation of N180/04 (27% of the 54 measured) and fold axis with main attitude \n\nN052/00 (Fig. 8). Projecting the data from the bedding planes oriented to the North direction, between \n\nN338/05 to N028/10, a subtle dip to N was seen, with trends to the NW. About the fracture planes, the \n\naverage sub-vertical attitude was N092/67. In the Lagoa Santa Member, the bedding planes are well \n\ndefined, and the most observed attitude was N060/24. Concerning the fold axes, the most frequent \n\nwas N360/13. The structural evidences explain the presence of outcrops in the Lagoa Santa Member \n\nin lower topography and its occurrence in the center-west of Sete Lagoas. The Serra de Santa Helena \n\nFormation presents structural features with ductile-ruptile behavior, a consequence of the regional \n\ntectonic evolution, subdivided in: (1) bedding planes with attitude of N060/03 (15% of the 185 \n\nmeasured), in addition to the 6 measured related to the fold axis with main attitudes of N009/13; and \n\n(2) fracturing planes with subvertical character and filled in with quartz or pegmatite veins. The main \n\nattitude was N013/77 (13% of the 64 measured), following ESE-WSW orientation (Fig. 8). \n\n \n\nFig. 5. Sigmoidal deformations form outcrop in Lagoa Santa Member indicating mass transport (left, \nUTM: 571617/7850185) and contact between the Pedro Leopoldo Member (lower) and the Lagoa \nSanta Member (upper) (right, UTM: 570000/7847000). \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Geologic conceptual model of Sete Lagoas and the surroundings  \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 42 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\n4.3. Spatial distribution of the geologic formations \n\n \n\nThe basement outcrops in the SW portion of the study area with elevations between 750 and \n\n950 m.a.s.l. and dips in the NE direction (Figs. 9, 10, and 11). The minimum surface contact is \n\napproximately 400 m.a.s.l., located in the north near the Velhas River. The overlying sediments from \n\nthe Sete Lagoas and Serra de Santa Helena formations follow the dip of the basement. \n\nAccording to the geologic cross sections, it was possible to propose, indirectly, a horst and \n\ngraben system controlled by faulting, which indicated different basement depths over small lateral \n\ndistances (e.g. 120 m offset in 1.4 km; 140 m in 2.5 km; or 200 m in 5 km). As an example, a lithologic \n\nwell profile, located approximately 800 m from where the basement outcrops, shows a depth to \n\nbasement of 80 m. \n\nThe Sete Lagoas and Serra de Santa Helena formations follow this horst and graben system, \n\npresenting thinner layers on the basin border in the SW region, and higher thickness in the NE (cross \n\nsections 1 to 14). In the case of the Sete Lagoas Formation, the limestones dip and become thicker to \n\nthe northeast, being covered almost totally by the Serra de Santa Helena Formation, where these \n\nlimestones arise mainly in the Santa Helena Ridge foothills and in the municipalities located to the \n\nsoutheast, near the Velhas River.  \n\nThe Serra de Santa Helena Formation is situated immediately over the Sete Lagoas Formation, \n\nnormally with abrupt contact. The contacts with basement are also abrupt, indicating that their \n\nsediments were deposited in area with little relief. This formation becomes thicker to the NE and \n\ncontains bedding planes, which dip to the NE, and thinner on the basin borders and near the Velhas \n\nRiver. These formations can reach 160 m thickness, seen in the north of Sete Lagoas (cross section \n\n3) and in the Santa Helena Ridge (estimated values).  \n\nThe thickness of the Cenozoic surface coverage is low in comparison to the other geologic \n\nformations. The best representation was seen in the central part of Sete Lagoas (urbanized area) and \n\nin the western part of this municipality, with approximate values of 40 m in thickness (cross sections 3, \n\n9, and 10). \n\nIn the urbanized area of Sete Lagoas, for the homonym formation, an antiform was interpreted \n\n(Fig. 11), with bedding planes oriented to the North (cross section 2) and surface contact around 500 \n\nm.a.s.l. (estimated, seen in section 4) and 580 m.a.s.l. (data from a stratigraphic drill hole made by \n\nSAAE, located on North of Sete Lagoas \u2013 seen in section 3 -  near 40 km in the x-axis). The majority \n\nof the urbanized area is included in a graben area, filled with limestones and unconsolidated \n\nsediments (cross sections 3, 10, and 11; also see Fig. 11).  \n\nIn the case of the Santa Helena Ridge, located near to the central part of Sete Lagoas, it was \n\npossible to deduce an upward displacement of the basement, indicated by a horst (cross sections 3, \n\n10, and 11). This horst might have elevated the stratigraphic sequence, where the Sete Lagoas and \n\nSerra de Santa Helena formations have more elevated altitudes than other regions. The fact that this \n\nstratigraphic sequence is cut by fractures filled quartz veins, the ridge is more resistant to erosion. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Geologic conceptual model of Sete Lagoas and the surroundings  \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 43 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\n \n \nFig. 8.

Geologic conceptual model \n\n \n\nA geologic conceptual model of the municipality of Sete Lagoas and the surroundings (Fig. 12) \n\nand a schematic synthesis model about the geological evolution were proposed (Fig. 13).  \n\nFrom the extensional events between 900 and 600 Ma. (Condie 2002) in the S\u00e3o Francisco \n\nCraton, the S\u00e3o Francisco Basin was originated, depositing silicate-carbonate sediments of the \n\nBambu\u00ed Group from the Neoproterozoic age, where the study area is included, directly on the border \n\nof this basin. These Neoproterozoic sediments were deposited on a stable epicontinental shelf with a \n\nlow gradient, which had three regressive sedimentary mega-cycles (with argillo-carbonate origin), \n\ngiving origin to the Sete Lagoas and Serra de Santa Helena formations, respectively.  \n\nAround 740\u00b122 Ma. (Babinski et al 2007), 630 Ma. (Caxito et al. 2012), or 540 Ma. (Warren et \n\nal. 2014), the Sete Lagoas Formation, by carbonate depositional systems with intermediary internal \n\nand external ramps (Lima 1997), gave origin to the limestones of the Pedro Leopoldo Member, at the \n\nbase, characterized by fine grained white limestones (in some cases, with dolomite and/or pelite level), \n\nand the Lagoa Santa Member, on the top, represented by medium grained black limestones.  \n\nLater, over the rocks from the Sete Lagoas Formation, a transgressive cycle (Ribeiro et al. \n\n2003) characterized by sub-coastal sea and relatively deep and weak flow enabled the deposition of \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Geologic conceptual model of Sete Lagoas and the surroundings  \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 47 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\npelite materials with plane-parallel stratums, crossed stratifications, and wave marks giving origin to \n\nthe Serra de Santa Helena Formation. This formation might have achieved minimum thickness values \n\nas low as 160 m (confirmed in lithologic well profiles). At the end of this cycle, the deposition of \n\nsilicate-carbonate sediments started giving origin to the Lagoa do Jacar\u00e9 Formation, found in the far \n\nNNW part of the study area.  \n\nDue to the deformation of the Espinha\u00e7o Supergroup in the Brazilian age (~600 Ma.) (Trompette \n\net al. 1993) and the proximity of this region (structural domain 1 - higher intensity of deformation) to \n\nthe study area (structural domain 2 \u2013 intermediate deformation magnitude), the rocks from the Bambu\u00ed \n\nGroup were intensely faulted and bended to the East, close to the stress coming from this deformation \n\n(Alkmim and Martins Neto 2001). In the west of the area, the structural features were less expressive \n\nand the sedimentary features were more preserved. These factors resulted in a horst and graben \n\nsystem, controlled by faulting, displacing the stratigraphic sequences, which enabled lithologic \n\nsequences of different ages side by side. Thus, the lower limestones of the Sete Lagoas Formation \n\nreached the surface in some areas.  \n\nWithin the municipality of Sete Lagoas, it was observed that the limestones from the Sete \n\nLagoas Formation, especially the Pedro Leopoldo Member, demonstrate important dissolution macro-\n\nfeatures developed either in bedding planes (most frequent) and in subvertical fractures (less \n\ncommon). Some of these dissolution zones were filled with terrigenous material, suggesting a past \n\nmeteoric water flow. In the case of the Lagoa Santa Member, the main dissolution features found were \n\ndry caves and grottoes, suggesting groundwater paleoconduits (e.g. Rei do Mato Cave). These \n\nevidences could suggest recent geomorphologic processes, such as a past meteoric water flow, or \n\ncould have started at the time when groundwater flow paths started to develop, even if these \n\nlimestones had not yet been exposed. As the timing of these processes is not precisely known, it is \n\nsuggested a specific study to be conducted to better understand more about the origin of these \n\nprocesses.  \n\nFinally, the Cenozoic unconsolidated sediments deposited in the central portion of Sete Lagoas \n\nwere a result of weathering and erosion of Santa Helena Ridge. These unconsolidated sediments also \n\nwere deposited along the beds of the Velhas River and in areas of low relief. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Geologic conceptual model of Sete Lagoas and the surroundings  \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 48 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFig. 12.

Conclusion \n\n \n\nThe uses of data from geologic mapping combined with a good database of lithologic well \n\nprofiles become an efficient set of tool to facilitate the spatial visualization and determine the geometry \n\nof the geologic formations in the subsurface and its side continuities. This fact also helped to identify \n\npossible blocks displaced indirectly by faults.  \n\nThe study area is along basement border, a result of extensional events in the S\u00e3o Francisco \n\nCraton, where silicate-carbonate sediments from the Neoproterozoic age were emplaced giving origin \n\nto the Bambu\u00ed Group.  \n\nDue to the relative proximity of this area with the Serra do Espinha\u00e7o (situated to the east and \n\nwhich undergone intense deformation), the Bambu\u00ed Group presents a horst and graben system, \n\ncontrolled by faulting, displacing the stratigraphic sequences, which enables formations with different \n\nages side by side.  \n\nIn relation to the thickness of sedimentary layers, the NE portion of the area is estimated to \n\napproximately 400 m, near the Velhas River.  \n\nAccording to lithological well profiles, the limestones from the Sete Lagoas Formation present \n\nhorizontal continuity, from the basement border to the Velhas River.  \n\nThe Santa Helena Ridge was interpreted as a horst, which elevated the stratigraphic sequence, \n\ncausing the Sete Lagoas and Serra de Santa Helena formations to have higher altitudes than in other \n\nregions. Considering that fracture filled quartz veins cut this stratigraphic sequence, the ridge became \n\nmore resistant to erosion.  \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Geologic conceptual model of Sete Lagoas and the surroundings  \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 50 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nThe urbanized area located in the municipality of Sete Lagoas is in a graben, where limestones \n\nfrom Sete Lagoas Formation and unconsolidated sediments from Cenozoic surface coverage having \n\non average 90 m and 40 m in thickness, respectively. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\n \n\nTo the companies Servmar Ambiental &amp; Engenharia Ltda. and SAAE, and to FAPESP (process \n\n2012/12846-9), for the financial support and the information release.

First, the permeability distribution of high permeability features \n\nmay be as one-dimensional features that are difficult to detect with wells, or may be so high in the \n\nwells that the upper measurement limit is encountered during aquifer testing. Secondly, turbulent flow \n\nmay make the application of continuum hydraulic principles difficult. Finally, permeability commonly \n\nhas a scale effect in which permeability in these systems increases with the scale of measurement. \n\nThe aquifer for Sete Lagoas, Brazil, is used to evaluate a permeability combination model \n\nmethodology to test the permeability structure across a range of spatial scales in order to develop a \n\nquantitative model of permeable features that is consistent across all scales of measurement, from \n\nmatrix properties to regional-scale flow. The aquifer in this study has some wells that do not have \n\nmeasurable drawdown during pumping due to high permeability. Permeability data indicated an \n\nincrease in permeability from the small- to the well-scale and a decrease from the well- to regional-\n\nscale. This is due to the localized development of karst bedding plane dissolution in one structurally \n\ncontrolled region of an aquifer with low matrix permeability. The results show that, based on \n\nmeasurement technique, the permeability data vary over many orders of magnitude, while the physical \n\nsize of permeable features of the aquifer are consistent across the scales of data collection with less \n\nthan an order of magnitude variation. The aquifer geometry of these hydraulically active features \n\nprovides a quantitative understanding of the scale effects of permeability measurements. \n\n \n\nKeywords: karst, permeability, transmissivity, hydraulic conductivity, scale effect, Brazil. \n\n \n\n1. Introduction \n\n  \n\nFormation bulk permeability depends on the shape, amount, and interconnectivity of void \n\nspaces, or permeability structure. This is often quantified with testing in the form of hydraulic \n\nconductivity or transmissivity values, which incorporate fluid properties and aquifer dimensions into the \n\nmeasurements. Grain size analyses, permeameters, aquifer tests and groundwater models are most \n\ncommonly used to obtain permeability estimates from small- to regional-scales. However, the \n\npermeability values can vary within a wide range over orders of magnitude, depending on the \n\ngeological formation. While flow properties are determined in rock bodies as hydraulic conductivity, \n\n\n\nChapter 7: The karst permeability scale effect of Sete Lagoas  \n\nDoctoral Thesis 70 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\ntransmissivity, or permeability, permeability data are the fundamental property of the rock body and \n\nmost easily converted to the physical dimensions of pores, fractures, or conduits. This work will \n\nassume that fractures are two dimensional features and conduits are conceptually one dimensional \n\nflow features. \n\nKarstic carbonate rocks are one of the most heterogeneous and anisotropic of all formations \n\nfound in nature, because the permeability structure of these formations are created by fluid flow \n\ngenerating a hierarchal rock structure of flow features that facilitates circulation in the downgradient \n\ndirection (Mangin, 1975). Consequently, karst hydraulic parameters are not an independent, inherited \n\nstatic attribute of the rock, but rather are dynamic over geological time (Huntoon, 1985). Another \n\nconsideration is that this structure can adjust as the flow regime responds to changing hydraulic \n\nboundary conditions. Thus, the hierarchy of permeability pathways and their organization within the \n\nformation are dictated by the hydrodynamic characteristics of the flow system operating within the \n\nrecent geological past and, to a variable degree, the characteristics of older flow systems (Ewers, \n\n1982). \n\nThe difficulties in the estimation of karst permeability are amplified by flow that may be non- \n\nDarcian, which leads to the cautious use of continuum estimations that assume Darcian flow. \n\nDepending on the dissolution feature size, causing locally high permeability, some standard aquifer \n\ntests may obtain no measurable drawdown as the test reaches the upper measurement limit, making \n\ncalculations of transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity values only a lower bound estimate (Halihan et \n\nal., 1999). These factors resulting in uncertainties in making permeability estimates are a key factor to \n\nunderstand groundwater flow and solute transport in the subsurface (Quinlan and Ewers, 1985; \n\nRehfeldt et al., 1989).  \n\nThese formations and their heterogeneity can lead to well-known permeability scale effects \n\n(Ratz, 1967; Kir\u00e1ly, 1975; Maclay and Land, 1988; Hovorka et al., 1995; Halihan et al., 1999). Scale \n\neffects are generally defined as continual increases in permeability magnitude from small- to regional-\n\nscale estimates (Kir\u00e1ly, 1975; Schulze-Makuch et al., 1999). In the Kir\u00e1ly (1975) study, made in \n\nMesozoic fractured and karstic limestone aquifers located in the Jura Mountains, Switzerland, it was \n\nhypothesized that the increase from small- to the well-scale was caused by fractures, and that the \n\nlargest permeabilities on the regional-scale were caused by karstic conduits. Halihan et al. (2000) \n\ntested if the Kir\u00e1ly (1975) hypothesis has an underlying physical basis using a permeability database \n\nfor the Cretaceous carbonates from the San Antonio segment of the Edwards aquifer and found that \n\nthe Kir\u00e1ly hypothesis was applicable for that aquifer, with nine orders of magnitude variability in \n\npermeability. In another study, Clauser (1992), analyzing a compilation of different type of crystalline \n\nrocks, noted that the permeability can increase three orders of magnitude from small- to well-scale, but \n\nfrom well- to regional-scale, the increase would not continue, but the Halihan et al. (2000) model \n\nindicated that if larger fractures were present, the permeability would continue to increase with scale. \n\nMany of these approaches compiled permeability data at a range of scales, but few provide a physical \n\nbasis for the values to allow increased predictability and scalability. \n\nOne approach to quantify the physical basis of the scale effect is via permeability combination \n\nmodels (PCM), providing estimates of the averaged permeability generated by a mixture of different \n\npermeable features in an aquifer, or the numerical effect of small-scale features on the well- or \n\n\n\nChapter 7: The karst permeability scale effect of Sete Lagoas  \n\nDoctoral Thesis 71 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nregional-scale data (Halihan et al., 1998; 1999; 2000). These models are steady-scale geometric \n\nmodels that estimate the effects of different heterogeneities on formation permeability structure, \n\nassuming measurements on different scales are all valid estimates for the scale the data were \n\ncollected. These models are modifications of equations for layered aquifers (Leonards, 1962; Fetter, \n\n1994).  \n\nTo predict formation values at the well-scale in a karstic formation, standard aquifer tests (slug \n\ntests, time-drawdown tests and step-drawdown tests) and the standard analytical equations (e.g. \n\nTheis, 1935; Cooper and Jacob, 1946), assuming Darcian flow, often provide reasonable fits to the \n\ndata (Kresic, 2013). These estimates should be used with caution, due to anisotropic or potential non-\n\nDarcian conditions. Additionally, these estimates may not be valid on a regional-scale, due to scale \n\ndependency. In case of regions with limited pumping test data, but having specific capacity test data, \n\nan alternative method to estimate permeability from these data utilizes empirical relationships between \n\ntransmissivity and specific capacity (Razack and Huntley, 1991; Mace 1997). In cases with no \n\nmeasurable drawdown occurring in a well, due to high permeability, a lower bound estimate can be \n\nobtained using a Thiem (1906) method (Halihan et al., 2000).  \n\nOn the regional-scale, groundwater models can be used to obtain permeability estimates \n\n(Scanlon et al., 2001; 2003), but other analytical approaches are available as well. One of these other \n\ntechniques is using a regional capture zone analysis, defined as the area of an aquifer in which all the \n\nwater will be removed by a pumping well or wells within a certain time period (Todd, 1980; Grubb, \n\n1993). In some cases, equations can be superimposed to calculate the capture zone of multiple well \n\nsystems (Javandel and Tsang, 1986). \n\nIn this research, an evaluation of multi-scale permeability structure, estimating values of \n\npermeability at the small-, well-, and regional-scale (along with hydraulic conductivity and \n\ntransmissivity) was conducted. These data were compared against observations of the physical size of \n\npermeable features, as well as calculations of the hydraulic dimension of fractures (hydraulic \n\napertures) and conduits (hydraulic diameters). Combining different methodologies, a quantitative \n\nhydrogeologic conceptual model was developed, consistent across all scales of measurement. The \n\naquifer studied was the Sete Lagoas karst aquifer (Pessoa, 1996), located within the limits of the \n\nmunicipality of Sete Lagoas, Minas Gerais, Brazil. This aquifer has common complications for karst \n\nsystems with meter scale pores and some pumping tests that obtain no measurable drawdown. \n\nQuantifying these parameters through different scales is important because of the increasing demands \n\non the aquifer, which require users to have a quantitative understanding of how the aquifer functions, \n\nso that it can be properly utilized and protected. For this, the PCM approach was utilized, comparing \n\nsmall-scale permeability data calculated by a permeameter with well-scale parameters calculated by \n\nstandard pumping tests and an estimated regional-scale value, via capture zone analysis of a multiple \n\npumping well system. These calculations were made to test possible correlations between different \n\nranges of scale and quantify variations in the permeability scale effect. The hypothesis is that while \n\nvalues of permeability vary over many orders of magnitude, the hydraulic dimensions of flow features \n\ncontrolling permeability measurements would remain a consistent physically quantifiable dataset for \n\nthe aquifer.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 7: The karst permeability scale effect of Sete Lagoas  \n\nDoctoral Thesis 72 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\n2. Site description \n\n \n\nThe aquifer studied was the Sete Lagoas karst aquifer (Pessoa, 1996), located in the \n\nmunicipality of Sete Lagoas, Minas Gerais, Brazil, 70 km northwest of Belo Horizonte, the state capital \n\n(Fig. 1). This municipality has a population greater than 200,000 over an area of 538 km\n2\n (IBGE, \n\n2010). The greatest population density is located in the older urbanized areas of the city. The current \n\nwater supply is almost entirely groundwater from the aquifer sourced from private and public wells. \n\nThe public supply wells are managed by the Water Supply and Sewage Service (SAAE) [SAAE - \n\nServi\u00e7o de Abastecimento de \u00c1gua e Esgoto]. The highest pumping rates are located in areas with the \n\ngreatest population density (Fig. 1).  \n\nGeologically, the area is located in the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton, where carbonate argillo-\n\narenaceous sediments are emplaced giving origin to the Bambu\u00ed Group (Branco and Costa, 1961; \n\nOliveira, 1967; Sch\u00f6ll and Foga\u00e7a, 1973; Dardene, 1978; Schobbenhaus, 1984; Ribeiro et al., 2003; \n\nTuller et al., 2010; Galv\u00e3o et al., in press). The hydrostratigraphic relationships for the Sete Lagoas \n\nkarst aquifer and spatial distribution are given in Pessoa (1996) and Galv\u00e3o et al. (2015). The aquifer, \n\nwhich is approximately 75 meters thick, consists of Neoproterozoic limestones, composed of two \n\nmembers: the Pedro Leopoldo Member (at the base) and the Lagoa Santa Member (on the top), in \n\nwhich the primary porosity and matrix permeability can be considered low (Moore, 1989) and the \n\nsecondary porosity is mostly filled by the precipitation of calcite (Tonietto, 2010). The majority of \n\ngroundwater migrates through dissolution features characterized as tertiary porosity. \n\nAccording to Galv\u00e3o et al. (2015), results from geologic mapping and optical well logging \n\nsuggest that the urbanized area of Sete Lagoas (Fig. 1) is primarily located in a graben, filled with \n\nlimestones from Sete Lagoas Formation, overlying Cenozoic unconsolidated sediments, and \n\noccasionally covered by competent rocks from the Serra de Santa Helena Formation (slate, marble, \n\nsiltstone and argillite). This setting results in fault bounded barrier boundaries for groundwater, which \n\ntogether with natural karst processes, explains the location of two dominant solutionally enlarged \n\nbedding planes in the Sete Lagoas formation with high permeability and significant storage capacity: \n\n1) a shallower and thicker continuous dissolution zone with conduits that are 1-8 m thick, near the \n\ncontact with the overlying unconsolidated sediments; and 2) 10-20 m below, a thinner continuous \n\ndissolution zone with conduits that are 20 cm to 1 m thick. These limestones dip and become thicker \n\n(reaching about 160 m thickness) and are completely covered by rocks from the Serra de Santa \n\nHelena Formation to the northeast. The two bedding plane conduits become thinner to the northeast.  \n\nThe hydrogeologic conceptual model for the aquifer in the urbanized area includes both non-\n\nkarstic and karstic bedding plane apertures based on optical well logs and outcrop field observations \n\n(Fig 2). This conceptual model is based on previous work conducted for a karst risk assessment \n\n(Galv\u00e3o et al., 2015). The terms \"non-karstic bedding planes\" for zones without karstification, and \n\n\"solutionally enlarged bedding planes\" for dissolution zones will be used here. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 7: The karst permeability scale effect of Sete Lagoas  \n\nDoctoral Thesis 73 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 1.

Methods  \n\n \n\nThe evaluation of scale effects in this research first involved building a database of permeability \n\nmeasurements from small- to regional-scales for the aquifer. Small-scale permeabilities were \n\nmeasured by means of a hand-held air permeameter. Well-scale evaluation utilized aquifer tests and a \n\nrelationship derived between specific capacity and transmissivity. A regional-scale estimate utilized \n\npotentiometric surface measurements and a capture zone analysis.  \n\nOnce the multi-scale database of permeability was available, empirical calculations were utilized \n\nto invert the database values to determine what size hydraulic features (i.e. pore diameter, fracture \n\nhydraulic aperture, or conduit hydraulic diameters) would be required to obtain measured field values \n\nof formation permeabilities. These inverted hydraulic values were utilized in a forward modeling PCM \n\napproach similar to Halihan et al. (1999) to test the stability of hydraulic features across the scales of \n\ndata. These methods will be presented sequentially from the bulk permeability database to the \n\ninverted estimate of the size of hydraulic features, and finally the PCM forward modeling. \n\nFor this paper, the name of each order of magnitude for scale was based on Kir\u00e1ly (1975). \n\nThese dimensions included: 1) small-scale from 10\n-2\n\n to 10\n0\n m, utilizing a rock matrix permeameter \n\nanalysis; 2) well-scale between 10\n0\n and 10\n\n2 \nm, by pumping test drawdown radius of influence; and 3) \n\nregional-scale from 10\n2\n to 10\n\n4 \nm, according to the size of the capture zone analysis of the multiple \n\npumping well system. \n\n \n\n3.1. Permeability database \n\n \n\nFor this work, small-scale measurements utilize hand samples and thin sections of aquifer \n\nmatrix. This measurement scale is occasionally divided by authors into a hand-scale and a micro-\n\nscale, but they are combined here to represent measurements of carbonate matrix pore properties. \n\nWell-scale data commonly are derived from aquifer tests. In this case, wells that have reached their \n\ntesting measurement limit by not being able to draw down the water table are included in the analysis. \n\nFinally, while many authors utilize groundwater model data for regional estimates (Thorkildsen and \n\nMcElhaney, 1992; Halihan et al., 2000; Scanlon et al., 2001; 2003), this work utilizes an analytical \n\ncapture zone solution. \n\n \n\n3.1.1. Small-scale: matrix data, optical microscopy analysis and permeability measurements \n\nField observations and optical microscopy using thin section for the two members of the \n\nNeoproteozoic limestone rocks from the Sete Lagoas karst aquifer were made in order to describe the \n\nfeatures of the matrix, such as rock mineralogy, grain size and micro-fractures. To measure the \n\npermeabilities in the matrix of these members, a TinyPerm II portable hand-held air permeameter, \n\nmanufactured by New England Research (NER), was utilized. \n\nPermeability measurements were performed on dry hand samples of limestones sourced from \n\nthe two members of the Sete Lagoas formation. The measurements were collected across dry, fresh \n\nand planar rock surface free of dust and without any weathering effects. Measurements (24 total) were \n\ntaken to determine the mean small-scale permeability, ksm, in darcys. These measurements were \n\n\n\nChapter 7: The karst permeability scale effect of Sete Lagoas  \n\nDoctoral Thesis 75 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nconverted to square meters, and then estimates of the small-scale hydraulic conductivity, Ksm, and \n\ntransmissivity, Tsm, of the entire aquifer thickness were calculated. The advantage of this non-\n\ndestructive method is the rapid and reproducible results (Fossen et al., 2011). \n\n \n\n3.1.2. Well-scale: aquifer test data and empirical relationship analysis \n\nSeven long duration (48 hours) transient pumping tests were conducted to measure the well-\n\nscale transmissivity, Tw [L\n2\n/t], using the Theis (1935) method. Pumping rates ranged from 47 to 194 \n\nm\n3\n/h. For the case of a zero drawdown well test in well PT-01, the Thiem equation (Thiem, 1906) was \n\nused for analysis by assuming 0.01 m (1 cm) of drawdown in the pumping well. This well and the \n\nobservation wells at distances of 25 m and 51 m were located in the central portion of the urbanized \n\narea. This test involved pumping PT-01 at a constant rate, Qw [L\n3\n/t], of 130 m\n\n3\n/h (see Table S1 in the \n\nelectronic supplementary material (ESM) for more information about pumping wells, well coordinates, \n\nand respective pumping rates and observation wells).  \n\nTwenty-seven time-drawdown or step-drawdown tests to estimate specific capacity, SC [L\n2\n/t], \n\nwere made utilizing the SAAE\u2019s supply wells. In mathematical terms, SC is defined as the pumping rate \n\nin the well, Qw [L\n3\n/t], divided by the observed decline in hydraulic head in the well, ?hw [L], from an \n\naquifer test. In the case of the step-drawdown tests, every discharge value was divided by its \n\nrespective drawdown, ?hw, observed in each step, and then the mean SC was calculated. These \n\nresults were analyzed by an empirical relationship derived for this karst aquifer by fitting a power law \n\nfunction between measured specific capacity and transmissivity, based on the Razack and Huntley \n\n(1991) and Mace (1997) methods. The goal was to estimate the most representative well-scale \n\ntransmissivity, and then estimate the well-scale hydraulic conductivity, Kw [L/t], both in non-karstic and \n\nsolutionally enlarged bedding planes, to estimate the well-scale permeability. Information about the \n\nphysical thickness of bedding planes, bw [L], were taken via optical well logging and outcrop field \n\nobservations (Galv\u00e3o et al., 2015). \n\nA transmissivity map was constructed from the data to observe the variability at the regional \n\nscale from well scale data (Fig. 4). For this, Tw values were utilized assuming the long duration \n\npumping test data were more accurate data than the empirical values from specific capacity data. It \n\nwas assumed that the values that were found in the observation wells for their respective pumping \n\nwells were located in the same hydrogeologic setting (Table S1 in the electronic supplementary \n\nmaterial (ESM)).   \n\n \n\n3.1.3. Regional-scale: potentiometric data and capture zone analysis \n\nTo develop a potentiometric map for regional-scale permeability evaluation, measurements of \n\nthe water table were taken only in SAAE's supply wells in the Sete Lagoas karst aquifer. The well \n\ncasing elevation data were acquired using a SRTM image (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission). \n\nAccording to Dem\u00e9trio et al. (2006), the accuracy in the use of this data is less than 5 m, which makes \n\nthe data a viable and economical source.  \n\nA capture zone analysis for the central high pumping rate well area was performed and an \n\nassessment of the accuracy of the analytical results was estimated. For this, some assumptions were \n\nmade, such as pumping wells in a confined aquifer with a uniform flow, under steady-state conditions. \n\n\n\nChapter 7: The karst permeability scale effect of Sete Lagoas  \n\nDoctoral Thesis 76 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nFrom the potentiometric map, a capture zone area was determined, based on estimated flow lines in \n\nthe potentiometric surface. Based on this geometry, analytical equations derived for confined aquifers \n\nby Todd (1980) and Grubb (1993) delineating the edge of the capture zone were used to estimate the \n\nregional-scale transmissivity, Tr [L\n2\n/t]: \n\n        \n  \n\n     \n                                                                                          \n\n        \n  \n    \n\n                                                                                            \n\nwhere Tr,x and Tr,y [L\n2\n/t] are the regional transmissivities in their respective directions, Qr [L\n\n3\n/t] is the \n\noverall pumping rate or regional discharge rate, XL [L] is the distance from the pumping well to the \n\ndowngradient edge of the capture zone (stagnation point), YL [L] is the half width of the maximum \n\ncapture zone, and i [dimensionless] is the hydraulic gradient.  \n\nThe regional discharge rate, Qr, was estimated by summing the pumping rate data values from \n\npublic supply wells (data provided by SAAE and Servmar Environmental &amp; Engineering) and private \n\nwells (data acquired from the SIAGAS's database - SIAGAS, 2006) extracting groundwater within the \n\ncapture zone. The next step was to estimate the transmissivity, Tr, based on the best fit-empirical \n\ncapture zone in comparison to the potentiometric capture zone, using the equation that describes the \n\nempirical edge of the capture zone for a confined aquifer: \n\n    \n  \n\n    \n      \n  \n\n \n                                                                                             \n\nwhere x [L] is the distance parallel to the regional hydraulic gradient and y [L] is the distance \n\nperpendicular to the regional hydraulic gradient (Todd, 1980; Grubb, 1993). A sensitivity analysis was \n\nconducted to evaluate the variability possible in this approach. \n\nThe final Tr was considered the average of both analytical values calculated, while the regional-\n\nscale hydraulic conductivity, Kr [L/t], was calculated by dividing these transmissivity values by the total \n\nthickness, btotal [L] (estimated at 75 m), and then converted the values to permeability in square \n\nmeters.  \n\nFinally, all these permeability data sets were entered in a GIS database and georeferenced in \n\nthe ArcGIS 10.1 software. The coordinate system was Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) \n\nprojection, Zone 23, datum SAD 69, with units in meters. Data from optical well logs and analytical \n\ncalculation results were considered to estimate the physical sizes of the dissolution zones, br [L]. \n\nThese values allowed a comparison between observed physical apertures and inverted hydraulic \n\napertures for the various data. \n\n \n\n3.2. Permeability component data \n\n \n\nIn order to test the stability of permeability feature sizes across various scales of measurement, \n\npermeability data were inverted to determine the physical size of hydraulic features that would be \n\ncapable of producing the various permeability values. This included calculating the hydraulic size of \n\nfracture apertures and conduit diameters, both under assumed laminar and turbulent flow conditions. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 7: The karst permeability scale effect of Sete Lagoas  \n\nDoctoral Thesis 77 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\n3.2.1. Sub-horizontal fracture hydraulic apertures  \n\nThe conversion between permeability values and the size of a sub-horizontal fracture was \n\ncalculated using the cubic law (Lamb 1932) allowing a relationship between the intrinsic permeability \n\nof a fracture, kf, [L\n2\n] and a fracture hydraulic aperture, bf  [L]:  \n\n    \n  \n \n\n  \n                                                                                              \n\nThis relationship allows the conversion between measured permeability values and physical \n\nfeature size. It is only an approximation in that it does not accommodate for fracture plane roughness \n\nand variability in fracture geometry. \n\nThe hydraulic fracture aperture was calculated from transmissivity or conductivity data from \n\naquifer tests using the hydraulic aperture of a single low-angle fracture equation (Halihan et al. 1999), \n\nbf  [L]: \n\n     \n         \n\n \n                \n\n   \n\n                                                                  \n\nwhere ? is the kinematic viscosity of the water [L\n2\n/t], Tw is the well-scale transmissivity [L\n\n2\n/t] calculated \n\nby pumping test, Ksm is the small-scale hydraulic conductivity of the matrix [L/t], btotal is the total \n\nthickness of aquifer [L], g is gravitational constant [L/t\n2\n], and ? is the angle between the fracture and \n\nthe horizontal plane, which is zero if the fracture is horizontal. \n\n \n\n3.2.2. Hydraulic conduit diameters \n\nThe hydraulic conductivity of a conduit, Kc [L/t], can be related to a conduit hydraulic diameter \n\nassuming both laminar and turbulent flow (Halihan et al. 1998). These hydraulic conductivity equations \n\ncan also be converted to permeability, but to illustrate the turbulent case, hydraulic conductivity is \n\nsimpler to illustrate.

These estimates should be smaller than the physical size of the features \n\nestimated from optical logging or outcrop evaluation, as they are hydraulic dimensions, not physical \n\nones. This set of equations allowed inversion of the permeability database and the same concept can \n\nbe used to generate forward models for evaluation of permeability scale effects. \n\n \n\n3.3. Permeability combination models \n\n \n\nFor the permeability combination forward model approach (PCM) to evaluate the scale effects in \n\nthe karst aquifer, the analytical models developed for small- to regional-scale were combined and \n\ncompared. These models are steady state and modifications of equations for layered aquifers. In \n\naddition, others assumptions were used to simplify the models, such as: 1) the hydraulic conductivity \n\nof the matrix is much less than the hydraulic conductivity of the fracture/conduit (this can be evaluated \n\nby utilizing the permeability database); and 2) according to Galv\u00e3o et al. (2015), the solutionally \n\nenlarged bedding planes are continuous permeable features controlling the hydraulic system, where \n\nsub-vertical fractures do not have significant influence on permeability structure across the scales of \n\nmeasurement.  \n\nFor the inverted hydraulic dimensions, the equations used to estimate the values for each scale \n\nwere: equation (4) at the small-scale; equations (5), (9) and (10) at the well-scale for both laminar and \n\nturbulent flow; and the respective equations (4), (9), and (10) were assumed to estimate the hydraulic \n\ndimensions at the regional-scale. \n\n \n\n4. Results  \n\n \n\nThe results will be presented sequentially from the bulk permeability measurements, to the \n\ninverted estimate of the size of hydraulic features, and finally the PCM results. \n\n \n\n4.1. Sete Lagoas permeability database  \n\n \n\nThe permeability database for Sete Lagoas illustrates that permeability values do not always \n\nincrease with scale. A figure illustrating the Sete Lagoas permeability scale effect, compared against \n\nthe Kir\u00e1ly (1975), Clauser (1992) and Halihan et al. (2000) studies, as well as with igneous rock, \n\nlimestone, karst, and gravel permeabilities (Heath, 1983) was generated to illustrate the effect in \n\ncomparison to other carbonate aquifers (Fig. 6). \n\n \n\n4.1.1. Small-scale analysis and measurements \n\nOptical microscopy analysis indicates the Neoproteozoic limestones from the Pedro Leopoldo \n\nMember (at the base) and the Lagoa Santa Member (on the top) are low permeability competent \n\nbedrock, with the secondary porosity (i.e. micro-fractures) generally filled by calcite. The rocks from \n\nPedro Leopoldo Member are composed of 85% micrite, 8% sparite and 7% quartz, classified as \n\nmicrite (Folk, 1959) or mudstone (Dunham, 1962), while the rocks from Lagoa Santa Member are 55% \n\n\n\nChapter 7: The karst permeability scale effect of Sete Lagoas  \n\nDoctoral Thesis 79 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nsparite, 30% ooids, and 15% micrite, classified as an oobiosparite (Folk, 1959) or grainstone \n\n(Dunham, 1962). These low porosity limestone features are in accordance with Moore (1989) and \n\nTonietto (2010).  \n\nHand sample TinyPerm measurements indicate no significant differences in permeability \n\nbetween the Pedro Leopoldo and Lagoa Santa members. The matrix permeabilities in the Sete \n\nLagoas Formation, combining both members, range from 1.9 x 10\n-16\n\n to 4.2 x 10\n-15\n\n m\n2\n. This results in \n\nhydraulic conductivity values, Ksm, between 1.6 x 10\n-4\n\n and 3.5 x 10\n-3\n\n m/d (1.9 x 10\n-9\n\n to 4.1 x 10\n-8\n\n m/s). \n\nThe matrix transmissivities,    , based on the mean total thickness of aquifer, btotal = 75 m, are \n\nbetween 1.2 x 10\n-2\n\n and 2.6 x 10\n-1\n\n m\n2\n/d (1.4 x 10\n\n-7\n to 3.1 x 10\n\n-6\n m\n\n2\n/s) (Table S2 of the ESM). These \n\nmeasurements are in accordance with values for limestone in other settings (Freeze and Cherry, \n\n1979), where permeability values of the matrix for limestone are approximately 10\n-13\n\n to 10\n-16\n\n m\n2\n and \n\nthe hydraulic conductivities are between 10\n-6\n\n and 10\n-9\n\n m/s. The results are on the lower end of the \n\nrange, but the values are consistent for limestone with secondary calcite precipitation. \n\n \n\n4.1.2. Well-scale: aquifer test data and empirical relationship analysis \n\nThe seven long duration transient pumping tests that were conducted in wells with karst bedding \n\nplanes indicated a range of well-scale transmissivities (Tw) from 90 m\n2\n/d, in the northeast region, to \n\naround 3600 m\n2\n/d, close to the Santa Helena Ridge foothills. Wells tested in the central urbanized \n\narea also showed high Tw values, above 1500 m\n2\n/d, while wells located in the northeast region, \n\ngenerally, indicated low values, below 500 m\n2\n/d (Table S1 of the ESM). The well-scale hydraulic \n\nconductivity values found (Kw) are in accordance with the Tw results, showing high values in the central \n\narea and low numbers in the northeast region (Table 1). \n\nIn a particular pumping test, conducted in the PT-01, central area, no drawdown was observed. \n\nFor this zero drawdown well, the Thiem equation was used to estimate a transmissivity value (Table \n\nS1 of the ESM). Using a pumping rate of 130 m\n3\n/h from the test, and assuming a drawdown of 0.01 m \n\n(1 cm), and the respective distances of 25 and 51 m of the piezometers PT-02 and PT-03 from the \n\npumping well PT-01, the result showed a transmissivity of 6 x 10\n4\n m\n\n2\n/d (6 x 10\n\n-1\n m\n\n2\n/s). This would \n\nresults, based on an aquifer thickness of 75 m, in a local hydraulic conductivity of 700 m/d (8 x 10\n-3\n\n \n\nm/s), and a permeability of 8 x 10\n-10\n\n m\n2\n. The uncertainty in these calculations may limit them as \n\npermeability data, but ignoring them adds bias. These data represent the highest well permeabilities in \n\nthe aquifer and are 5 orders of magnitude above the highest small-scale measurements.  \n\nThe results of the specific capacity test analysis indicated results similar to previous research \n\n(Razack and Huntley, 1991; Mace, 1997). A plot of the logarithms of transmissivity and specific \n\ncapacity values for the Sete Lagoas karst aquifer appears linear in log-log space (Fig. 3). The best-fit \n\nline to these data was: \n\n           \n     \n\nwhere Tw and Sc are in m\n2\n/d.

Relationship between specific capacity and transmissivity values for the Sete Lagoas karst \naquifer, showing the best-fit line. \n \n\nTo evaluate if this empirical equation was reliable, a Tw recalculation was made and compared \n\nto the Tw values obtained in the seven pumping tests (Table S1 of the ESM). This comparison showed \n\nreasonable results, generally of the same order of magnitude, which was expected due to some \n\ninherent uncertainties of this method (Razack and Huntley, 1991; Mace, 1997).  \n\nUtilizing the best    data over the various portions of the aquifer (Table 1 and Table S2 of the \n\nESM), a transmissivity map was made (Fig. 4). The highest well-scale transmissivities, Tw = 1,500 - \n\n3,600 m\n2\n/d (1.7 x 10\n\n-2 \n- 4.1 x 10\n\n-2\n m\n\n2\n/s) and the zero drawdown well test (located in the area of the \n\nsolutionally enlarged bedding plane) are concentrated in the central area, within the graben area and \n\nclose to the Santa Helena Ridge foothills. A decrease in these values occurs in the northeast direction, \n\nTw = 90 - 250 m\n2\n/d (1.1 x 10\n\n-3 \n- 2.9 x 10\n\n-3 \nm\n\n2\n/s) (Fig. 4). These values coincide with the optically \n\nobserved fracture apertures of the solutionally enlarged bedding planes described by Galv\u00e3o et al. \n\n(2015), where the thicker apertures are located in the central graben area and close to the Santa \n\nHelena Ridge foothills.   \n\nThese data suggest a direct relationship between karstified fracture apertures and high well \n\ntransmissivities. In the case of Kw, dividing both results from the central and the north portions by the \n\nrespective thickness of the aquifer, the hydraulic conductivity values range from 1 to 36 m/d (1.2 x 10\n-5\n\n \n\n- 4.2 x 10\n-4\n\n m/s) (Table 1 and Table S2 of the ESM). This would result in well-scale permeability, kw, \n\nvalues of 1.2 x 10\n-12\n\n and 4.2 x 10\n-11\n\n m\n2\n, respectively. These results represent an increase of 2 to 4 \n\norders of magnitude above the highest small-scale permeability values.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 7: The karst permeability scale effect of Sete Lagoas  \n\nDoctoral Thesis 81 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 4. Well-scale transmissivity map showing the variation of transmissivity, which the highest values \nare concentrated in the central area, close to the Santa Helena Ridge foothills, and in the eastern \nportion of the city. The majority of these high values are located within a central graben area, including \nthe \"zero drawdown well\" controlled by the solutionally enlarged bedding planes. The dashed lines \nindicate uncertainties. The graben area boundary was based on the delineation of Galv\u00e3o et al. \n(2015). \n \n\n4.1.3. Regional-scale: potentiometric data and capture zone analysis \n\nTo estimate the regional-scale permeability, a capture zone method in a multiple well system \n\nwas applied. According to the potentiometric data and approximate flow lines (Fig. 5), the Santa \n\nHelena Ridge is a watershed boundary, where the eastern portion of the map has the groundwater \n\nflowing to the northeast, while the western portion has the groundwater flowing to the northwest. In the \n\ncentral area, there is a flow convergence, generated by a considerable cone of depression, explained \n\nby the high pumping rate in the central wells. In this specific area, a capture zone was recognized (Fig. \n\n5a).  \n\nUtilizing equations (1) and (2), with a stagnation point (XL) = - 2,000 m; half width of capture \n\nzone (YL) =\u00b1 4,000 m; regional pumping rate (Qr) = 75,000 m\n3\n/d; and hydraulic gradient (i) = 0.008 \n\n(Fig. 5a, b), the analytical regional-scale transmissivities, Tr [L\n2\n/t], were estimated: \n\n        \n      \n\n                       \n                               \n\n        \n      \n\n             \n                                \n\nWith transmissivities between 750 and 1,170 m\n2\n/d, this would results in an analytical regional-\n\nscale hydraulic conductivities from 10 to 16 m/d (1.2 x 10\n-4\n\n - 1.8 x 10\n-4\n\n m/s) and regional-scale \n\n\n\nChapter 7: The karst permeability scale effect of Sete Lagoas  \n\nDoctoral Thesis 82 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\npermeabilities of 1.2 x 10\n-11\n\n - 1.8 x 10\n-11\n\n m\n2\n. This represents a three order of magnitude increase over \n\nthe small-scale measurements, but a decrease relative to many of the well-scale data.  \n\nTo evaluate the possible variability using this analytical methodology, a sensitivity analysis was \n\nconducted adjusting Tw values within this capture zone, found in the Fig. 4 (Tw = 700 - 1,000; 3,000 \n\nm\n2\n/d) to assess the relative accuracy (Fig. 5c). The best-fit empirical capture zone was found with a \n\ntransmissivity = 900 m\n2\n/d (1.1 x 10\n\n-2\n m\n\n2\n/s - see black continuous and dashed lines on Fig. 5c), which \n\nwould result in a hydraulic conductivity of 12 m/d (1.4 x 10\n-4\n\n m/s) and permeability of 1.4 x 10\n-11\n\n m\n2\n. \n\nThe calculation of the best-fit empirical capture zone can be seen below: \n\nPart A: half width of the capture zone, XL [L]: \n\n      \n      \n\n           \n          \n\nPart B: distance to the stagnation point, XL [L]: \n\n      \n      \n\n                  \n            \n\nPart C: shape of the curve describing the capture zone, x [L]. The following values are for one-half of \n\nthe capture zone, which is symmetrical about the x-axis: \n\n \n\nIn the case of a possible lower estimate of pumping rate value from private wells that perhaps \n\nwere not included in the analysis (no data or not being registered) and, thus, not added to the final Qr \n\nvalue used in the calculations above, a sensitivity analysis also tested the effects of pumping rate (Fig. \n\n5d). The transmissivity was fixed at 900 m\n2\n/d (best-fit) adjusting only the pumping rate. The result \n\nshowed that, using Qr  = 100,000 m\n3\n/d, the value of XL had no significant change, while YL had a small \n\nchange. Now, using Qr = 50,000 and 150,000 m\n3\n/d, there was a significant change, both in XL and YL. \n\nHowever, if some private wells data have not been included, the majority are residential wells, with \n\nlower pumping rates, which is not significant in the total sum of Qr. The public wells located within the \n\ncaptured zone that were included in the analysis represent the highest pumping rates and have the \n\ngreatest impact on the discharge value used in the equations. \n\n\n\nChapter 7: The karst permeability scale effect of Sete Lagoas  \n\nDoctoral Thesis 83 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 5.

Small-scale: matrix data and feature sizes \n\nAccording to permeameter and microscopy analysis for these types of lithologies, the \n\npermeability of the matrix is between 10\n-16 \n\nand 10\n-15 \n\nm\n2\n, classified as low permeability competent \n\n\n\nChapter 7: The karst permeability scale effect of Sete Lagoas  \n\nDoctoral Thesis 84 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nbedrock, with the secondary porosity generally filled by calcite. The hydraulic fracture aperture, bsm, \n\nrequired to generate this level of permeability would be considered between 10\n-8 \n\nand 10\n-7 \n\nm (or 0.01 \n\nand 0.1 ?m). These values are in accordance with values for limestone pore diameters of the matrix, \n\n?sm, around 0.1 ?m (Zinszer and Pellerin 2007). \n\n \n\n4.1.2. Well-scale permeable feature sizes \n\nUsing empirical hydraulic equations for estimating sub-horizontal fracture apertures, the results \n\nanalyzed for each well showed that the hydraulic fracture aperture, bf, has a range of 1 - 4 mm. For \n\nthe estimated hydraulic conduit diameter, assuming laminar flow, dc,lam, the result is between 2 - 5 mm, \n\nwhile assuming turbulent flow, the hydraulic conduit diameter, dc,turb, ranges from 2 to 13 mm (Table \n\n1). The mechanical apertures seen in the optical well logs showed local values between 0.2 m and 8 \n\nm, which illustrates a large difference between hydraulic and physical feature size, with hydraulic sizes \n\nbeing orders of magnitude smaller. These empirical hydraulic values are a combination of both the \n\nflow from the upper and lower bedding planes, as the values of Tw used in the equations (5), (9) and \n\n(10) were from pumping tests simultaneously extracting water from the two bedding planes. \n\n \n\n4.1.3. Regional-scale: overall bedding planes and karst aquifer thicknesses \n\nUsing values of Tr found via regional capture zone method to estimate the values of regional \n\nhydraulic fracture aperture, laminar and turbulent conduit in that range, the respective equations (4), \n\n(9), and (10) were assumed. The combined results ranged between 2 to 6 mm (fracture aperture: 2 - 3 \n\nmm, laminar flow conduit: 3 - 4 mm, and turbulent flow conduit: 5 - 6 mm), slightly lower than the well-\n\nscale hydraulic size. \n\n \n\n4.3. Permeability combination model \n\n \n\nCombining different approaches for different scales, according to the basic model of two \n\nbedding planes (Fig. 2), it was possible to accommodate appropriately the small-, well-, and regional-\n\nscales of measurement and compare the values against a conceptual model of hydraulic features. \n\nThese forward models were used to test whether the hydraulic feature sizes of the inverse conceptual \n\nmodel could be extended across the scale of measurements for a single quantitative conceptual model \n\nfor the aquifer. For the Sete Lagoas permeability combination model, the only significant permeable \n\nfeatures were the two solutionally enlarged bedding planes in the aquifer. The model assumes that the \n\nmeasured permeabilities at the various scales are valid estimates of permeability at each scale.  \n\nAt the small-scale, the mean permeability of the matrix is very low (from 10\n-16 \n\nto 10\n-15\n\n m\n2\n) (Fig. \n\n6), because the matrix is composed of a Neoproterozoic fine-grained (Pedro Leopoldo Member, at the \n\nbase) and a medium-grained (Lagoa Santa Member, on the top) limestone, with the secondary \n\nporosity (micro-fractures) generally filled by calcite. Relative to the bedding plane features, these \n\nvalues can be approximated on time scales for pumping or regional flow estimates as zero. For the \n\nsimple conceptual model across the scales, a value of 10\n-15\n\n m\n2\n was assumed to represent the matrix \n\npermeability. \n\n\n\nChapter 7: The karst permeability scale effect of Sete Lagoas  \n\nDoctoral Thesis 85 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nIn the case of well-scale permeability features, an increase of between four and six orders of \n\nmagnitude in comparison to the matrix (10\n-12\n\n - 10\n-10\n\n m\n2\n) is noted (Fig. 6), due to the solutionally \n\nenlarged bedding planes. Regarding the zero drawdown wells, the result showed permeability around \n\n10\n-9\n\n m\n2\n. The inversion indicates that these can be simulated as a single hydraulic fracture that is 1 - 2 \n\nmm in size in the non-karstified bedding plane regions (values from fracture apertures) and 2 - 13 mm \n\nin size in the karstified region depending (values from laminar, 2 - 5 mm, and turbulent conduit \n\ndiameters, 2 - 13 mm) on whether the model allowed for turbulent flow (Table 1). For the simple \n\nconceptual model for the system, a non-karstic fracture with a 1 mm aperture and a karstic fracture \n\nwith a 5 mm aperture were assumed. At the well-scale in a 75 meter thick aquifer, these fractures yield \n\npermeabilities of 10\n-12\n\n m\n2\n in non-karstic areas and 10\n\n-10\n m\n\n2\n in karstic areas. \n\nAt the regional-scale, the values of permeability have a slightly smaller value in comparison to \n\nthe largest well-scale values. The regional-scale permeability was approximately 10\n-11\n\n m\n2\n (Fig. 6). The \n\ninverted permeability sizes were 2 - 6 mm though, consistent with the non-karstic and karstified \n\nbedding plane estimate at the well-scale. For the simple conceptual model of the system at the \n\nregional-scale, the regional value of permeability was 10\n-11\n\n m\n2\n for the area encompassed by the \n\ncapture zone analysis. This estimate can be reached by assuming a 2 mm fracture existing over the \n\nregional-scale, or by constructing the regional permeability from the well-scale permeabilities. Using \n\nthe two well-scale permeabilities from the simple model of 1 and 5 mm fractures, the karstic zone in \n\nthe center of the pumping area can be modeled as a layered aquifer averaging the flow with the result \n\nbeing similar to the larger value. When the lower value is utilized near the southwest portion of the \n\naquifer, this would be flow across the layers, resulting in a value similar to the lower value. With \n\nreasonable approximations for karstic and non-karstic zones, this again results in a regional \n\npermeability of 10\n-11\n\n m\n2\n.     \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 7: The karst permeability scale effect of Sete Lagoas  \n\nDoctoral Thesis 86 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nTable 1.

Permeability scale effects in the Sete Lagoas karst aquifer (red line) in comparison with other \ncarbonate scale effect studies and with permeability ranges for various lithologies (Heath 1983). The \nscale effect of the study area presents an increase of hydraulic conductivities from small- to well-scale \nand a decrease of these values from well- to regional-scale, having similar behavior with the \ncompilation of crystalline rocks scale effects (Clauser 1992 - grey line). In the case of Edwards aquifer \nscale effect line (Cretaceous limestones and dolomites from San Antonio segment, Halihan et al. 2000 \n- black line) and the Jura Mountains scale effect line (Mesozoic fractured and karstic limestone \naquifers, Kir\u00e1ly 1975 - dashed grey line) significant increases in permeabilities across scales are \nobserved.  \n \n\n5. Discussion \n\n \n\nA schematic scale effect conceptual model block diagram for Sete Lagoas karst aquifer was \n\nmade (Fig. 7) to show how a simple model of hydraulic feature size affects each scale, considering \n\npermeabilities measured and the inverted hydraulic feature size. The changes in permeability (k) or \n\nassociated hydraulic values (K, and T), the respective size permeable features from small- to well-\n\nscale, and a decrease of these values in some areas from well- to regional-scale were quantitatively \n\nobserved for the aquifer, both through the inversion of field measurements and the forward modeling \n\nof a simple conceptual model with a single fracture of both karstic and non-karstic settings.  \n\nThe porosity and permeability, as well as the aperture of the fractures in the matrix are very low. \n\nThus, the hydraulic conductivity of the matrix is much lower than the hydraulic conductivity of the \n\nbedding planes intercepted at the well-scale. Increases between four and six orders of magnitude in \n\nthe parameters from small- to well-scale were observed. However, from well- to regional-scale, the \n\nincrease did not continue, having a small decrease in the values (Figs. 6 and 7). The same behavior in \n\nthe empirical size permeable features was observed, where values of hydraulic aperture of 0.01 - 0.1 \n\n?m (small-scale) are increasing to 2 - 13 mm (well-scale) and decreasing to 2 - 6 mm (regional-scale). \n\nThese inverted hydraulic sizes are significantly smaller than outcrop fracture or conduit sizes \n\nconsistent with previous investigations based on connectivity and fracture variability.  \n\n\n\nChapter 7: The karst permeability scale effect of Sete Lagoas  \n\nDoctoral Thesis 88 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nThese quantitative relationships between feature size and hydraulic properties showed that, \n\nunlike other karst areas have increases in permeability in scale effects from small- to regional-scale, \n\nsuch as Edwards Aquifer located in the United States (Halihan et al., 2000) and Juras Mountain in \n\nSwitzerland (Kir\u00e1ly, 1975), this behavior does not happen in Sete Lagoas karst aquifer in Brazil (Fig. \n\n6). The relationships are in accordance with Clauser (1992) results, where permeabilities increase \n\nfrom small- to well-scale, but from well- to regional-scale they do not continue. The difference is that \n\nthe effects that Clauser (1992) observed happened in crystalline rock (Fig. 6). According to Kir\u00e1ly \n\n(1975) and Halihan et al. (2000), increase from small- to the well-scale are caused by fractures being \n\nincorporated into the well-scale measurements of permeability, and the largest permeabilities on the \n\nregional-scale were caused by karstic conduits being incorporated. This increase can obtain nine \n\norders of magnitude variability (Halihan et al., 2000) (see Edwards aquifer scale effect line on Fig. 6). \n\nThis can be interpreted that the scale effect and dependency in karst aquifers is more related to \n\nfracture and conduit connectivity.  \n\nIn the study area, based on the geologic mapping and optical well logs data (Galv\u00e3o et al., \n\n2015), the sub-horizontal solutionally enlarged bedding planes have the primary role in providing \n\naquifer transmissivity. All the wells are intercepting sub-horizontal bedding plane discontinuities, \n\nextracting groundwater from the Neoproterozoic Sete Lagoas karst aquifer dominantly from the main \n\ntwo continuous bedding planes, which are more solutionally enlarged in the central area and less \n\nkarstic to the northeast (Figs. 2 and 7). Thus, in the case of a low matrix permeability in a karst aquifer \n\nin which is governed by bedding planes and low sub-vertical fractures, the chance to have a \n\nconsiderable increase in the scale effect from well- to regional-scale is considered low. Both in well- \n\nand regional-scale, in this case, the largest permeabilities occur due to the same karstic solutionally \n\nenlarged bedding planes. This interpretation is in accordance with Singhal and Gupta (2010), where \n\ncarbonate rocks of Paleozoic and Mesozoic ages, which are well cemented and recrystallized, often \n\nhave water flow primarily through conduits and fractures. The physical reality is that the flow through \n\nthese planar features may be best modeled as conduits instead of fractures, but the quantitative \n\nvariability does not alter the result. \n\nAt the well-scale, there is variation between low and high values of transmissivity and hydraulic \n\nconductivity. The central area, located within a graben area and with more karstification, has the \n\ngreatest permeabilities values, including the zero drawdown well pumping test. These solutionally \n\nenlarged bedding planes are the most important structural features in the Neoproterozoic limestones \n\nfrom the Sete Lagoas karst aquifer, providing pathways for groundwater flow and great storage \n\ncapacity. In the northeast portion of the area, smaller values of transmissivity are more common, \n\nsuggesting less karstic bedding planes (confirmed by lithologic well logs, by Galv\u00e3o et al., 2015). The \n\ndepth of these limestones and its lithologic contacts could explain these different degrees of \n\nkarstification. According to Ford and Williams (2007), transmissivity values, and consequently \n\nhydraulic conductivity and permeability, can be expected to vary according to vertical position in karst \n\nrock. In most cases, it will be highest in the most weathered zone of limestone near the surface \n\n(epikarst) and usually diminishes exponentially with depth.  \n\nRegarding the zero drawdown aquifer test, located in the central urbanized area, some \n\nresearchers believe that these tests are unusable or useless, while others affirming that permeability \n\n\n\nChapter 7: The karst permeability scale effect of Sete Lagoas  \n\nDoctoral Thesis 89 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nmay be at some \"practical infinity\" or simple testing limit for aquifer testing methodologies (Rovey, \n\n1994; Halihan et al., 2000). The limitation of aquifer tests to predict permeabilities was examined using \n\nthe Thiem equation, for steady-state flow in a confined aquifer, estimating the highest local \n\npermeabilities values caused by the solutionally enlarged bedding planes. \n\nAt the regional-scale, a capture zone with dimensions of 8 km by 8.5 km (68 km\n2\n), caused by \n\nthe high pumping rate in wells estimated in 75,000 m\n3\n/d (Fig. 5) was present. The permeability at the \n\nregional-scale has a little decrease of these values compared to well-scale (Fig. 6), which means that, \n\nat the regional-scale, the groundwater is also governed by the same karstic conduits observed at the \n\nwell-scale, but the value is decreased by incorporating non-karstic areas in the regionally averaged \n\nvalue. If a groundwater model was generated at the regional-scale with grid dimensions below a \n\nkilometer, it would be expected that higher permeabilities than generated using the capture zone \n\nanalysis may be required to simulate the system with lower adjacent values to represent non-karstic \n\nareas. This would modify the permeability scale effect database to indicate a leveling off of values \n\nbetween well- and regional-scales instead of a decrease in permeability. \n\nThe implications of this analysis are that an increase of measurement scale does not always \n\nimply an increase of permeability in these settings, because it will depend of the type of lithology and \n\nthe connectivity of high permeability features. In the case of the study area, the scale effect had a \n\nreduction of the permeability values, due to the localized development of karst bedding plane \n\ndissolution in one structurally controlled region of the aquifer. Another implication is that \n\nmeasurements can be applied at different scales if the connectivity and structure is well understood to \n\ndevelop a robust quantitative model of the hydraulic structure of the aquifer. One limitation is that \n\ntransport should not be calculated at a given scale using continuum approximations, as they will \n\nunderestimate transport times by averaging low permeabilities with high permeability values. A second \n\nlimitation is the need to consider whether turbulent effects are important for estimating permeability or \n\nthe hydraulic size of a feature supplying flow. \n\nCompared to other regions of the world, a single quantitative model of permeability scale effects \n\ncan be elucidated from this and other associated studies. Aquifers are composed of a range of \n\nhydraulically connected permeable features. As these systems are sampled, the features sizes and \n\nconnections vary depending on the choice of measurement method. Determining a strong evidence-\n\nbased conceptual model of what features control permeability allows us to make prediction about \n\nquantitative values of permeability expected at various scales. Matrix permeability is often small in \n\nthese systems, but should not be assumed to be neglected. A number of young carbonate systems \n\nhave significant permeability in the matrix of the system. Well-scale permeability is expected to vary \n\nsignificantly in most cases as fracture aperture distribution may be strongly variable as in the Edwards \n\naquifer of Texas (Halihan, 2000), or the aperture of single horizontal fractures can also be highly \n\nvariable as they are sampled spatially (this study; Muldoon et al., 2001). On a regional-scale, \n\nunderstanding of potentially connected conduits is important for many karst aquifers, but this study \n\nillustrates that conduit permeability may not be a strong regional effect if large conduits are not well \n\nconnected on the scale of measurement. For this aquifer, a smaller grid size regional model would \n\nlikely observe some high permeability grid blocks in the central aquifer, but these values would be well \n\nsupported by the conceptual model built from aquifer testing and optical logging of the system. \n\n\n\nChapter 7: The karst permeability scale effect of Sete Lagoas  \n\nDoctoral Thesis 90 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 7. Schematic scale effect conceptual model for Sete Lagoas. In a Neoproterozoic karst aquifer \ngoverned by solutionally enlarged bedding planes, with negligible permeability of the matrix, the \nchance to have a considerable increase in the scale effect from the well- to the regional-scale is low. \n \n\n6. Conclusion \n\n \n\nUnlike other karst areas that have increases in permeability from small- to regional-scale, such \n\nas Edwards Aquifer located in the United States (Halihan et al., 2000) and Juras Mountain in \n\nSwitzerland (Kir\u00e1ly, 1975), this behavior does not happen in Sete Lagoas karst aquifer, in Brazil. In \n\nthis area, an increase of about four to six orders of magnitude in the permeabilities from small- to well-\n\nscale is common, but from well- to regional-scale, the value decreases.  \n\n\n\nChapter 7: The karst permeability scale effect of Sete Lagoas  \n\nDoctoral Thesis 91 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\n At the well-scale, the highest permeability wells are concentrated in the central area and close \n\nto the Santa Helena Ridge foothills, within the graben area, and in the East portion of the study area, \n\nwith decreases occurring to northeast direction. These data coincide with the thickness of the karst \n\nbedding planes, suggesting a direct relationship between solutionally enlarged bedding planes \n\nthickness and formation permeability. However, the Sete Lagoas karst aquifer has some zones of high \n\nkarstification, which the standard aquifer test used is an insufficient method for estimation, evidenced \n\nby zero drawdown, illustrating the limits of aquifer tests. These zones are located specifically in the \n\ncentral portion of the urbanized area. Non-Darcian flow likely occurs in these wells. At the regional-\n\nscale, in the central portion of the study area, there is a potentiometric flow convergence, setup by a \n\ncone of depression and high pumping rate in wells, being recognized as a capture zone. \n\nThe results indicate that multi-scale evaluation using different approaches is useful to develop a \n\nquantitative hydrogeological conceptual model in karst aquifers, consistent across scales of \n\nmeasurement, from small- to regional-scale flow. These methodologies used obtained results \n\nsuggesting that in Neoproterozoic karst aquifers with negligible permeability of the matrix, governed by \n\nbedding planes discontinuities, would not have increases in permeability from well- to regional-scale, \n\nunless a zone of more significant karstification occurred on that scale.  \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments  \n\n \n\nThis work was funded by Servmar Environmental &amp; Engineering and by S\u00e3o Paulo Research \n\nFoundation (FAPESP) [Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo] (process \n\n2012/12846-9).

The main \n\ngoal is to determine, by stable isotopes \n18\n\nO and \n2\nH and major ions measurements, the identification of \n\nhydrogeologic processes, surface-ground water connections, possible recharge zones and its \n\nflowpaths. The majority of the groundwater samples were collected in this urban karst aquifer, while \n\nthe superficial waters were collected in seven main lakes. The stable isotopes results indicated that \n\nthe origin of groundwaters is directly from precipitation, having a limited period of recharge. In the \n\ncentral urbanized area, where the karst aquifer is in contact with Cenozoic unconsolidated sediments, \n\nit could have punctual superficial water infiltration. The major ions presented the highest values at the \n\nsame region, where the most karstic area from the Sete Lagoas Formation is located. These data \n\ncould suggest higher water reservoir indicating more mineralization, which are in concordance with the \n\ngeologic information.  \n\n \n\nKeywords: Stable isotopes, geochemistry, hydrogeology, groundwater, Brazil. \n\n \n\n1. Introduction \n\n \n\nA better understanding of hydrological processes and the hydrochemical evolution is very \n\nimportant for regional water resources development and management in karst region, where a unique \n\nand complex flow system exists because of special rock-water reactions (Han et al. 2014). Due to \n\ngroundwater storage and flowpath in karst aquifers are extremely heterogeneous, it is often difficult to \n\ndescribe and quantify the flow characteristics with traditional methods. These features also reflect in \n\nthe type of recharge, where are often characterized by high vertical permeabilities due to vertical \n\nconduits and sinkholes allowing rapid recharge of the groundwater (Ford and Williams 1989, Hess et \n\nal. 1989) as well as, in some cases, are also connected to surface-water interaction making \n\ngroundwater highly susceptible to contamination (Ryan and Meiman 1996). \n\n\n\nChapter 8: Stable isotopes and geochemical studies to evaluate flowpaths and recharge areas   \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 98 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nGenerally, a karst aquifer is a result of a karstification by chemical, and sometimes, mechanical \n\nactions of water in lands composed by soluble rocks such as limestone, dolomite, or gypsum \n\nbedrocks, in which the flowpath of the groundwater is closely related to the degree of the karst \n\ndevelopment (Palmer 1991). This development is characterized by the dominance of chemical \n\nweathering in the surface and subsurface. When the acidic water, as result of rainwater passing \n\nthrough the atmosphere, or in the ground/soil picking up carbon dioxide (CO2), starts to break down \n\nthe surface of soluble bedrock near its cracks, or bedding planes (Ford and Williams 1989). As time \n\ngoes on, these fractures will become wider, and eventually, a drainage system of some sort may start \n\nto form underneath.  \n\nThese processes can result in many different groundwater transmission and storage conditions. \n\nSome display strictly in single porosity, either as matrix only (common in young reefal and eolian \n\nlimestones), or as fissure only (e.g. incipient karst in marble). Large volumes of most karst aquifers will \n\ndisplay at least dual porosity, exhibiting matrix plus fissure, matrix plus conduit or fissure plus conduit, \n\nor can have a true triple porosity (matrix-fissure-conduit) recognized in some portions of most large \n\nexplored caves (Ford 1999). \n\nThere are different categories for karst recharge areas. If the karst area recharges itself, it is \n\ncalled autogenic recharge. Allogenic recharge occurs when the adjacent non-karst areas recharge the \n\nkarst aquifer. The presence of sinkholes gives a distinct recharge feature, which can be separated into \n\npoint (shaft and conduit dominated), and diffuse (matrix, meso-pore, and macro-pore dominated) \n\ninfiltration and recharge. These areas are the major flowpath for contaminants (Goldsheider and Drew \n\n2007, Karamouz et al. 2011). \n\nIdentifying the various sources and areas of recharge in karst systems, its flowpaths, and the \n\nsurface-ground water interaction is important for proper water resource management. Many \n\nresearchers have focused to understand these mechanisms using different tools, such as \n\nhydrogeochemistry, geomorphologic structure, hydrologic dynamics of karst flow, as well as estimating \n\nthe mean rate and spatial distribution of the recharge areas (Andreo et al. 2008, Farf\u00e1n et al. 2009, Liu \n\net al. 2009, Li et al. 2010, Zhao et al. 2010). Other techniques including dye tracers, salts, smoke and \n\ngaseous tracers and stable isotopes are also used (K\u00e4ss et al. 1998, Ginsberg and Palmer 2002, \n\nKaramouz et al. 2011).  \n\nAmong these, the stable isotopes of \n18\n\nO and \n2\nH have been used in numerous hydrogeologic \n\ninvestigations combining with geochemistry data. Some examples can be cited: storm hydrograph \n\nseparation (Kennedy et al. 1986, Buttle 1994, Harris et al. 1995, Machavaram et al. 2006), surface-\n\nground water interactions (Fontes 1980, McKenna et al. 1992, Coplen and Kendall 2000, O'Driscoll et \n\nal. 2005, Lee and Kim 2007), or geochemical variations and origins of dryland and salinity (Winston \n\nand Criss 2003, Cartwright et al. 2004). This method also has been successful in identifying the \n\ncontribution of surface water to groundwater in karst environment (Katz 1995, Meyers et al. 1993, \n\nPlummer et al. 1998). \n\nWhile the use of stable isotopes in hydrogeology started in the 50s, with the pioneering works of \n\nUrey et al. and Epstein and Mayeda (in Clark and Fritz 1997), in Brazil, the first hydrogeological \n\nstudies using this method started in the late 60s and early 70s in the northeast, southeast and \n\nAmazon regions (Silveira and Silva Junior 2002). However, due to karst areas in Brazil are not so \n\n\n\nChapter 8: Stable isotopes and geochemical studies to evaluate flowpaths and recharge areas   \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 99 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nextensive in comparison to other regions in the world, such as USA, Europe and Asia, the use of this \n\ntechnique to identify the various sources and areas of recharge in karst aquifers is still incipient.  \n\nIn regards to this paper, the primary goal was to determine, by \n18\n\nO and \n2\nH isotopes and major \n\nions measurements, the hydrogeologic flow processes in Sete Lagoas\u2019 aquifers, in order to \n\nunderstand possible origin and mechanisms of groundwater recharge and its flowpaths. In this city, the \n\ncurrent water supplies is almost entirely groundwater from the karst aquifer (Pessoa 1996) and this \n\nunderstanding is important to promote aquifer protection against problems related to intensive \n\nexploitation and water contamination. The majority of the water samples were collected from lakes and \n\ngroundwater wells, between August 2011 and June 2013 for stable isotopic and geochemistry \n\nanalyzes. \n\n \n\n2. Site description \n\n \n\nThe study area is the city of Sete Lagoas, located in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, 70 km \n\nnorthwest of Belo Horizonte, the state capital (Fig. 1). This city has a population greater than 200,000, \n\nover an area of 538 km\n2\n (IBGE 2010). The greatest population density is located in the central, west-\n\ncentral and north-central areas of the city, corresponding to the older areas of occupation. There is a \n\nconsiderable industrial, mineral and metallurgical center located mainly along the main federal \n\nhighway, which is a corridor of significant growth. The current water supply is almost entirely \n\ngroundwater from the Sete Lagoas karst aquifer (Pessoa 1996), pumping by private and public wells, \n\nwhich in the case of the last one, is managed by the Water Supply and Sewage Service (SAAE) \n\n[SAAE - Servi\u00e7o de Abastecimento de \u00c1gua e Esgoto].  \n\nGeologically, the area is located in the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton, where carbonate argillo-\n\narenaceous sediments are emplaced giving origin to the Bambu\u00ed Group (Branco and Costa 1961, \n\nOliveira 1967, Sch\u00f6ll and Foga\u00e7a 1973, Dardene 1978, Schobbenhaus 1984, Ribeiro et al. 2003, \n\nTuller et al. 2010, Galv\u00e3o et al. in press). The hydrostratigraphic relationships for the Sete Lagoas \n\nkarst aquifer and spatial distribution are given in Pessoa (1996) and Galv\u00e3o et al. (2015).  \n\nThe Sete Lagoas karst aquifer consists of Neoproterozoic limestones, in which the primary \n\nporosity and matrix permeability can be considered very low (Moore 1989) and the second porosity \n\n(micro-fractures) is mostly filled by calcite (Tonietto 2010, Galv\u00e3o et al. 2015). Thus, the majority of the \n\nfluids migrate through dissolution features characterized as tertiary porosity, in conduits. According to \n\nGalv\u00e3o et al. (2015), results from geologic mapping and optical well logging suggest that the \n\nurbanized area of Sete Lagoas is primarily located in a graben, filled with limestones from the Sete \n\nLagoas Formation, Cenozoic unconsolidated sediments, and occasional competent rocks from the \n\nSerra de Santa Helena Formation (slate, marble, siltstone and argillite). This setting results in barrier \n\nboundaries for groundwater, which together with natural karst processes, explains the location of two \n\nmain solutionally enlarged bedding planes with large groundwater storage capacity: (1) a shallower \n\nand thicker continuous dissolution zone with conduits that are 1-8 m thick, near the contact with \n\nunconsolidated sediments; and (2) 10-20 m below, a thinner continuous dissolution zone with conduits \n\nthat are 20 cm to 1 m thick. These limestones dip and become thicker and completely covered by \n\n\n\nChapter 8: Stable isotopes and geochemical studies to evaluate flowpaths and recharge areas   \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 100 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nrocks from the Serra de Santa Helena Formation to the northeast, reaching about 160 m thickness, \n\nwhere the two bedding plane conduits become thinner to the northeast (Galv\u00e3o et al. 2015).  \n\nGeomorphologically, the area is in a karst setting, which provides the presence of lakes, located \n\nmainly in the central area, some caves, close drainage basin, and sinkholes located in a limestone \n\noutcrops context (Pessoa 1996) (Fig. 1). Areas that have denser drainage are related to the Santa \n\nHelena Ridge foothills in the center, basement outcrops in the south, and metasediments in the north. \n\nThe elevation of the area ranges from around 750 to 1000 m, declining from southwest to northeast, \n\nwhere the highest elevations are located in the Santa Helena Ridge.  \n\nRegarding the climate, the mean total monthly precipitation is 106 mm, while the total annual is \n\n1271.8 mm. The rainy season occurs from October to March, with total rainfall of 1132 mm, \n\ncorresponding to 89% of annual precipitation. The period with less precipitation occurs from April to \n\nSeptember, with 139 mm. The average annual temperature is 20.9 \u00baC, which July has the lowest \n\nmonthly mean value (17.5 \u00b0C), and February the highest one (22.9 \u00b0C). The annual variation is around \n\n5 \u00b0C. According to Pessoa (1996), the water balance of Sete Lagoas is divided, monthly, in: 1) water \n\nexcess from January to March; 2) water deficit from April to September; and 3) water replacement \n\nbetween October and December, period of groundwater recharging.  \n\n \n\n3. Methods \n\n \n\nTo obtain information about groundwater and superficial water to better understand the above \n\ndescribed hydrogeological setting and its interconnections, 30 supply wells, and 7 lakes sampling \n\nsurveys were conducted during August 2011 and August 2013, collecting data of in-situ \n\nphysicochemical parameters and carrying out chemical analyses of major ions and stable isotopes. \n\nThese methods will be presented sequentially followed by the approach to data integration. \n\n \n\n3.1 Stable isotopes \n\n \n\nGroundwater samples were taken during August 2011 and November 2012 in 30 SAAE's public \n\nwells (Table 1 and Fig. 1) used to supply Sete Lagoas (25 samples from Sete Lagoas karst aquifer \n\nand 5 samples from the basement). In the case of the karst aquifer, according to Galv\u00e3o et al. (2015), \n\nthe wells located in the central area are pumping waters from the two main solutionally enlarged \n\nbedding planes, corresponding to the majority of the wells analyzed. These samples were taken after \n\nremoving several well volumes of water, using pumps installed in these wells. This was done to purge \n\nthe aquifer of stagnant water and to acquire fresh aquifer samples for analysis. After sampling, were \n\nmeasured physicochemical parameters (pH, temperature - T, electrical conductivity - EC, and \n\noxidation-reduction potential - ORP) using the HI 9828 portable multiparameter meter. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 8: Stable isotopes and geochemical studies to evaluate flowpaths and recharge areas   \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 101 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 1. Location map, in UTM coordinates, of Sete Lagoas showing the geology, the drainage pattern \n(interpreted from georeferenced images, including aerial photography and Landsat imagery), and karst \nfeatures location (caves and sinkholes) (modified from Galv\u00e3o et al. 2015). The figure also shows the \nlocation of sampling points, such as groundwater in supply wells (yellow dots), rainwater collector \n(central black rectangle, next to Jos\u00e9 Felix lake), and surface water in seven lakes (orange star). \n \n\nThe surface water samples were collected only in June 2013, in seven lakes: Brej\u00e3o, Grande, \n\nJos\u00e9 Felix, Paulino, Pedras, Piranhas, and Fazenda da Morada (Table 1 and Fig. 1). For this, samples \n\nwere taken in the center of each lake using a peristaltic pump (brand Geopump). This method followed \n\nthe low flow principle, avoiding sediment from the lake's substrate (Puls and Barcelona 1996).  \n\nEleven cumulative monthly rain isotope samples were also collected representing a hydrological \n\nyear, from April 2012 to April 2013 (no samples in July 2012 due to lack of rain). For this, a \n\npolypropylene bottle (10 L) with an also polypropylene funnel connected in that bottle were used and \n\nplaced in a cooler to keep the temperature and prevent sunlight penetration. A silicone hose with 6 m \n\nlong was also attached on the bottle to balance the pressure and prevent exchanges with atmospheric \n\nair. This method followed the GNIP (Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation) instruction, where \n\nevaporation and loss of lighter isotopes are negligible (IAEA/WMO 2004). \n\nThe main concern with these samples was to avoid the post-sampling fractionation. For this, \n\npre-cleaned polypropylene vials (30 ml) were used. These vials were completely filled with samples, \n\navoiding air bubbles inside and stored in coolers maintaining the temperature. All samples were \n\n\n\nChapter 8: Stable isotopes and geochemical studies to evaluate flowpaths and recharge areas   \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 102 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nanalyzed for \n18\n\nO and \n2\nH at the Groundwater Research Center (CEPAS) [CEPAS - Centro de \n\nPesquisas de \u00c1guas Subterr\u00e2neas], Institute of Geosciences, University of S\u00e3o Paulo. The samples \n\nwere run on PICARRO L2130i, processed by Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) for \n\nLasers software, and were normalized to internal laboratory water standards that were previously \n\ncalibrated relative to the Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW). The results were expressed \n\nas ?\n18\n\nO and ?\n2\nH, where ?sample (\u2030) = ((Rsample /Rstandard) ? 1) \u00d7 1000, where R is D/H, \n\n18\nO/\n\n16\nO. The \n\nanalytical precisions were \u00b10.09\u2030 for ?\n 18\n\nO and \u00b10.9\u2030 for ?\n 2\nH. \n\nAfter all these analysis, all the samples were compared with the latest Global Meteoric Water \n\nLine (GMWL) reported by Rozanski et al. (1993). This meteoric water line is linearly related by the \n\nequation ?\n2\nH = 8.17 ?\n\n18\nO + 11.27, and it is an enhancement to the first meteoric water line proposed \n\nby Craig (1961), related by the equation ?\n2\nH = 8 ?\n\n18\nO + 10. This high correlation coefficient reflects the \n\nfact that the oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopes in water molecules are intimately associated. \n\n \n\n3.2 Geochemistry analysis \n\n \n\nThe same supply wells used to collect groundwater samples for isotopic analysis were also \n\nused for geochemistry analysis (Table 2). Samples for major cations (Na\n+\n, K\n\n+\n, Ca\n\n2+\n, Mg\n\n2+\n), major \n\nanions (HCO\n-\n3, CO\n\n-2\n3, SO\n\n2-\n4, Cl\n\n-\n, NO\n\n-\n3), total dissolved solids (TDS), and total water hardness (WH) \n\nwere collected in pre-cleaned 1 L plastic polyethylene bottles, and then, stored in coolers at 4\u00b0C, \n\naccording to the Brazilian Sampling and Water Preservation Guide (CETESB 1998). For some \n\nanalyses, samples were filtered through a 0.45 ?m filter, while for major cations were acidified with \n\nnitric acid to a pH of less than 2. All these samples were analyzed at the Analytical Solution \n\nCompany's laboratory, in S\u00e3o Paulo. \n\nAfter that, all the measurements were checked for accuracy by calculating the mass balance, \n\nand then the water types were classified using the Piper's diagram of water (Piper 1944) using the \n\nAquaChem 4.0 software (Fig. 6). In order to help understand the spatial concentrations of each \n\nparameter, kriging interpolations of the data were carried out using the Surfer 8 software to drawn \n\nisopleth maps. \n\nFinally, all the data sets were entered in a GIS database and georeferenced in the ArcGIS 10.1 \n\nsoftware. The coordinate system was Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection, Zone 23, \n\ndatum SAD 69, with units in meters. \n\n \n\n4. Results \n\n \n\nThe results will be presented sequentially from the stable isotope analysis for rainwater, \n\nsuperficial water and groundwater, and finally the geochemistry results, for groundwater.  \n\n \n\n4.1 Stable isotopes \n\n \n\nThe groundwater stable isotopic composition was little variable, not reflecting significant \n\ndifference signatures through one year. The ?\n18\n\nO values varied from -5.26 to -7.31\u2030, with a mean of -\n\n\n\nChapter 8: Stable isotopes and geochemical studies to evaluate flowpaths and recharge areas   \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 103 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\n6.45\u2030, while ?\n2\nH values varied from -37.6 to -47.0\u2030, with a mean of -42.5\u2030. The deuterium excess \n\nvalues ranged from 6.78 to 11.48\u2030, with a mean of 9.08\u2030 (Table 1). The mean isotopic compositions \n\nof the groundwater fell in the GMWL, with mostly samples on or near the GMWL, while others plotted \n\nfairly tightly in the lower right, where the best-fit linear regression line had a slope of 4.80 and an \n\ninterception of -11.53. Both waters from Sete Lagoas karst aquifer and basement are mostly located at \n\nthe same region on the graphic, clustered, with no discernible spatial trend (Fig. 2). \n\nThe ?\n18\n\nO and ?\n2\nH values from the seven lakes collected were well variable (Table 1). When \n\n?\n18\n\nO is plotted against ?\n2\nH (Fig. 2), the mean isotopic compositions of the lake water fell well to the \n\nright of the global meteoric water line along a best-fit linear regression line with a slope of 5.13 and an \n\ninterception of -9.04. Even both groundwater and lake water had some similarities in their linear \n\nregressions, with slopes values around 5 and negative interceptions around 10, the distribution of ?\n18\n\nO \n\nand ?\n2\nH values through the meteoric water line were not similar, where the groundwaters presented \n\nmore negative values.  \n\nThe ?\n18\n\nO values of rainfall varied from 2.93 to -5.62\u2030, mostly being negative. Rainwater ?\n2\nH \n\nvalues varied from 25.8 to -36.5\u2030. Deuterium excess values ranged from 2.36 to 13.82\u2030 with a mean \n\nof 11.72\u2030. The result shows that mostly rainwater samples fell along the GMWL (Fig. 2), where some \n\ndeviations of highest rainwater values can be attributed to atmospheric-evaporative effects during the \n\nsampling. Due to this effects, probably caused by a problem in the rain collector in some isolated \n\nmonths, as well as an insufficient data of rain to build a consistent local meteoric water line (only 11 \n\nsamples, because in July there was no rain enough for sampling), the samples was just compared \n\nwith the GMWL together with the groundwater and lake samples.  \n\n \n\nFig. 2.

The values of pH ranged from 6.1 to 8.1 with a mean value of 7.1, and EC ranged from 69 to \n\n590 ?S/cm, with a mean value of 322 ?S/cm. The T ranged between 21.8 and 25.5\u00baC and mean value \n\nof 23.2 \u00baC, while ORP from 74 to 329 mV, with a mean value of 134 mV. While pH and EC had the \n\nhighest values in the central portion, within the graben area, data for T and ORP did not present the \n\nsame pattern (Fig. 3). \n\nRegarding the major ions, Na\n+\n and Ca\n\n2+\n together accounted for 75\u201399% of total cations (except \n\nin some wells located around the basement - PT-78, 81, 86, 87, and 89, between 43\u201366%, and in the \n\nSanta Helena Ridge foothills - PT-105, around 26%). HCO\n?\n\n3 was the most abundant anion in the \n\nwaters, while SO\n2?\n\n4 was the second most abundant one. On the other hand, the anion CO\n-2\n\n3 almost \n\ndid not occur (only observed in the PT-69). All these highest values, as well as the high values in the \n\nrest of the cations and anions are essentially located in the central portion of the area, within the \n\ngraben area in the Sete Lagoas karst aquifer (Figs. 4 and 5). The spatial distribution of major ion \n\nconcentrations is consistent, coinciding with the pH and EC, TDS and WH concentrations (Fig. 3). \n\nAccording to Custodio and Llamas (2001), the classification of hardness as CaCO3, in mg/L, is: \n\n&lt;50 (soft), 50-100 (moderately hard), 100-200 (hard), and > 200 (very hard). 56% of the water \n\nhardness results presented values between 100 and 200 mg/L classified as hard waters, 26% \n\nbetween 50 and 100 mg/L, classified as moderately waters, and 13% with a content below 50 mg/L. \n\nThe supply well PT-51 exceeded 200 mg/L classified as very hard, while PT-105 did not presented \n\nhardness (Fig. 3). \n\nAccording to the Piper's diagram (Fig. 6), the majority of the sampled waters, 50%, were \n\nclassified as of Ca\n2+\n\n?HCO\n-\n3 type, fitting with those classified by Pessoa (1996). The second most \n\ncommon water type was Ca\n2+\n\n?Na\n+\n?HCO\n\n-\n3, about 23% of the samples, while 10% of the waters were \n\nclassified as of Ca\n2+\n\n?Na\n+\n?HCO\n\n-\n3 type, and 7% as of Ca\n\n2+\n?Mg\n\n2+\n?Na\n\n+\n?HCO\n\n-\n3 type (Appelo and Postma \n\n2005). The rest of the sampled water, 10%, were classified as of Na\n+\n?Ca\n\n2+\n?Mg\n\n2+\n?HCO\n\n-\n3, \n\nMg\n2+\n\n?Na\n+\n?HCO\n\n-\n3, and Mg\n\n2+\n?HCO\n\n-\n3, being noted in individual sampled wells (Fig. 6). In some cases, \n\nwaters near the basement outcrops or located in had more pronounced Mg\n2+\n\n and Na\n+\n+ K in their \n\ncompositions. In the case of waters relatively far from the basement, generally, were more enriched in \n\nCa\n2+\n\n and Na\n+\n, associated to limestones from the Sete Lagoas Formation. However, the presence of \n\nbicarbonate ions (HCO\n-\n3) in all cases is predominant. Waters from the basement (PT-78, 81, 86, 87 \n\nand 89) had enrichment of Mg\n2+\n\n, as well as close to the Santa Helena Ridge (PT-105). Some samples \n\nwith nitrate (PT-12, 18, 19, 22) indicated different behavior, being not clustered with the rest of the \n\nsamples, which means that this water probably had some alteration on their natural compositions. \n\n\n\nChapter 8: Stable isotopes and geochemical studies to evaluate flowpaths and recharge areas   \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 106 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nTable 2.

Piper's diagram of the major ion composition of waters collected in Sete Lagoas. On the map \n(right), it is possible to see the location of each one type of water. Waters near the basement outcrops \nor located in had more pronounced Mg\n\n2+\n and Na\n\n+\n+ K on their compositions. In the case of waters \n\nrelatively far from the basement, they are more enriched in Ca\n2+\n\n and Na\n+\n, associated to limestones \n\nfrom the Sete Lagoas Formation. The presence of bicarbonate ions (HCO\n-\n3) in all cases is \n\npredominant. Waters in the basement (PT-78, 81, 86, 87 and 89) had a little enrichment of Mg\n2+\n\n, as \nwell as close to the Santa Helena Ridge (PT-105). Some samples exceeding 10 mg/L can indicate \ndifferent behavior, being not clustered with the rest of the samples, probably having any alteration on \ntheir natural composition. \n \n\n5. Discussion \n\n \n\nThe discussion will be presented sequentially from the stable isotope and geochemistry \n\ninterpretations, to the water evolution and sources of recharge, presenting a schematic conceptual \n\nmodel of Sete Lagoas. \n\n \n\n5.1 Stable isotopes \n\n \n\nThe lake waters from Sete Lagoas have the highest values of ?\n2\nH and ?\n\n18\nO, falling well below \n\nthe global meteoric water line, forming an evaporation line, an indication that these waters are \n\nexposed to a high degree of evaporation (Fig. 2). It is important to relativize that these lake waters \n\nwere collected during the dry season, in June, where the evaporation rate is high, reflecting the \n\nlocation of these points in the graphic.  \n\n\n\nChapter 8: Stable isotopes and geochemical studies to evaluate flowpaths and recharge areas   \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 111 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nThe groundwater samples, both from karst aquifer and basement, which were collected during \n\ndry and rainy seasons, have mostly samples clustered, with the majority of them on or near the \n\nGMWL, indicating recharging directly from precipitation. Other samples were plotted fairly tightly in the \n\nlower left, which give an appearance of evaporation. Regarding the clustering of groundwater \n\nsamples, it could suggest a limited period of recharge, according to Clark and Fritz (2007), where the \n\nrainy season in Sete Lagoas occurs from October to March, corresponding to 89% of annual \n\nprecipitation (Fig. 2), having October, November and December as being the recharging period, \n\naccording to the water balance proposed by Pessoa (1996). \n\nIn the case of groundwater samples plotted in the lower left, this situation could suggest that, in \n\nsome situations, groundwater locally could receive superficial water contributions. Some pumping \n\nwells, which the groundwater samples were collected, are located next to some lakes, e.g. PT-71 \n\n(Brej\u00e3o Lake), PT-75, 77 (Grande Lake and Piranhas Lake). Other wells also have evidences of little \n\nevaporation and are located or close to some lakes (Jos\u00e9 Felix Lake and Paulino Lake) or close to \n\ndrainages and in the Cenozoic unconsolidated sediments. The groundwaters in Sete Lagoas are \n\nstored in two main solutionally enlarged bedding planes, where in the central portion of the area are \n\ncovered by these unconsolidated sediments (Galv\u00e3o et al. 2015). In this region, groundwater could \n\nhave punctual superficial water contributions (from lakes or small drainage, Fig. 1), reflecting in the \n\nplotting of some dots in the lower left of the GMWL, forming this evaporation pattern.  \n\nThus, the overall evidences could suggest that the groundwaters in Sete Lagoas: (1) are \n\nrecharged directly from precipitation; (2) have a limited period of recharge during the recharging \n\nseason, from October to December; and (3) in the central portion, where the karst aquifer is in contact \n\nwith Cenozoic unconsolidated sediments, could have superficial water infiltration. \n\n \n\n5.2 Geochemistry \n\n \n\nThe major ions presented the highest values at the same region, where the most karst area \n\nfrom the Sete Lagoas Formation is located, within the graben area, coinciding with the pH, EC, TDS \n\nand WH values, which present the same concentration behavior (Figs. 3 to 5). These data could \n\nsuggest a large water reservoir indicating more mineralization, which are in concordance with the \n\ngeologic information commented by Galv\u00e3o et al. (2015). This area is primarily located in a graben, \n\nfilled with a deposit of limestones resulting in barrier boundaries for groundwater, which together with \n\nnatural karst processes explain the location of two main solutionally enlarged bedding planes with \n\nlarge groundwater storage capacity.  \n\nThe water hardness, which refers to the ability of water to form encrustations, prevent the \n\nsudsing of soap, is due the presence of calcium and magnesium cations, forming insoluble \n\ncompounds. Hard water contributes to inefficient and costly operation of water-using appliances. Pipes \n\ncan become clogged with encrustations that reduces water flow and ultimately requires pipe \n\nreplacement. This can pose serious problems in industrial settings, as well as in domestic purposes, \n\nwhen hardness is above 100 mg/L. The highest values were found in the central urbanized area, \n\nwhich the population living in this area can have problems related of encrustations. Indeed, according \n\nto fieldwork investigations and interviews with local residents, these problems are common. \n\n\n\nChapter 8: Stable isotopes and geochemical studies to evaluate flowpaths and recharge areas   \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 112 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nThe presence of a high value of Mg\n2+\n\n ion in the central area (23.97 mg/L) compared to the \n\nremaining areas could indicate localized dolomite occurrences or dolomitic limestones, enriching some \n\nwater compositions. These ions also could indicate water residence time because of its low dissolution \n\nkinetic (Mudry 1987, Plagnes 1997, Batiot et al. 2003). Commonly, the more severe the low flow \n\nconditions, the more mobilized becomes the water, with increased residence time (Fig. 4).  \n\nNitrate (as NO\n-\n3) occurs in almost all natural water, except when contamination is present, when \n\nthey seldom exceed 20 mg/L (Hounslow 1995). However, 10 mg/L or greater may be regarded as a \n\nprobable indication of contamination (e.g. from fertilizer, municipal wastewaters, septic systems, etc.). \n\nIn the central portion of the urbanized area, values over 10 mg/L (PT-01: 10.34 mg/L; PT-15: 17.55 \n\nmg/L; PT-17: 17.00 m/L) and even greater than 20 mg/L (PT-12: 37.5 mg/L) were found. According to \n\nFoster and Hirata (1987), inefficient management of domestic sewage in-situ sanitation systems is the \n\nmain source of nitrate in urbanized areas, particularly in developing countries. The NO\n-\n3 is also an \n\nindication of recent contamination related to construction problems in wells or a lack of aquifer \n\nprotection (Alaburda and Nishihara 1998). As construction problems on these wells with high nitrate \n\nvalues were not observed during fieldworks, and the concentrations are located only in the central \n\nportion of the urban area (Fig. 5), it could be interpreted as a local contamination by superficial \n\ninfiltration probably by domestic sewage or septic tank, which can be considered as an evidence of \n\nlocal connections between surface waters and groundwaters, corroborating with the isotopic data.  \n\nRegarding the higher Ca\n2+\n\n concentrations in the central area, is probably due to the reaction of \n\ncalcite with carbon dioxide (CO2) derived from respiration or oxidation of organic matter. In this region, \n\nis common the presence of Cenozoic unconsolidated sediments right above the limestones (may \n\nreach up to 40 m thick - Galv\u00e3o et al. 2015, in press), which could provide carbon dioxide reacting with \n\nwater that infiltrates through these sediments to form carbonic acid (H2CO3). This acid provides \n\nprotons (H\n+\n), which can associate with the carbonate ion (CO\n\n2-\n3) from calcite (CaCO3) to form \n\nbicarbonate (HCO\n-\n3), and then take place dissolution and precipitation. It can be seen in the Fig. 6 that \n\nthe concentrations of HCO\n-\n3 are much higher and located in the whole area, while the CO\n\n2-\n3 values is \n\nonly seen in one sampling well, being zero in the rest of the area, indicating the last stage of the \n\nreaction of the dissolution of calcite. Other evidences are the concentrations of these ions as function \n\nof pH. The pH values are between > 6.3 and &lt;10, where within this interval HCO\n-\n3 is the most \n\npredominant species than CO\n2-\n\n3 (Fig. 5). \n\nWaters tend to precipitate calcite or dolomite when it is oversaturated and tend to dissolve them \n\nif it is undersaturated. The Saturation Index (SI) is perhaps the most widely used method to determine \n\nthe amount of calcite that will be precipitated or dissolved. The results show that almost all \n\ngroundwaters are undersaturated in dolomite and calcite (Fig. 7). The fact that the waters are \n\nundersaturated in dolomite and calcite indicates that both elements can dissolve in this system, which \n\nmeans that the two main solutionally enlarged bedding planes that the groundwaters are stored and \n\nare being pumped are still undergoing processes of karstification.  \n\nSo, a question can be asked: is this a natural phenomenon or is this event a result of pumping \n\nthrough decades? Analyzing the Fig. 8, where there is a comparison between SI and pumping rate, no \n\nrelationship was noted, such as high pumping rates and low values of SI, suggesting a natural \n\nphenomenon that took place well before the origin of the city and the anthropogenic well pumping.   \n\n\n\nChapter 8: Stable isotopes and geochemical studies to evaluate flowpaths and recharge areas   \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 113 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig.7. Saturation Index (SI) of calcite and of dolomite versus HCO\n-\n3 of all collected samples. Almost all \n\ngroundwaters are undersaturated in dolomite and calcite. This fact indicates that both elements are \ndissolving in this system, which the two main solutionally enlarged bedding planes are still undergoing \nprocesses of karstification.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 8. Saturation Index (SI) of calcite and of dolomite versus pumping rates. No relationship between \nthose parameters was seen, such as high pumping rates and low values of SI, suggesting a natural \nphenomenon that took place well before the origin of the city and the well pumping.   \n \n\n5.3 Water evolution and sources of recharge \n\n \n\nA schematic water evolution conceptual model of Sete Lagoas was proposed (Fig. 9). \n\nGenerally, the Sete Lagoas karst aquifer consists of Neoproterozoic limestones that has the primary \n\nporosity and matrix permeability very low and the second porosity (micro-fractures) mostly filled by \n\ncalcite (Galv\u00e3o et al. 2015). Thus, the majority of fluids migrate through dissolution features \n\ncharacterized as tertiary porosity developed in bedding planes (most frequent) and sometimes in \n\nsubvertical fractures (less common), not receiving much contribution from the matrix (Galv\u00e3o et al. \n\n2015). In the case of the basement, waters fluid through subvertical fractures.  \n\n\n\nChapter 8: Stable isotopes and geochemical studies to evaluate flowpaths and recharge areas   \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 114 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nIn areas where the limestone outcrops, where some sinkholes and caves are located (Figs. 1 \n\nand 9), can be considered as direct recharge zones (or autogenic recharge), receiving rainfall waters \n\nby runoff. In some cases, these waters infiltrate through unconsolidated sediments and in the \n\nbasement outcrops until reach the water table in the karst aquifer, being classified as allogenic \n\nrecharge. The autogenic waters infiltrate in the sinkholes and caves located mostly in the south and \n\nsoutheast (Fig. 1), with higher elevations and flowing mainly in the two solutionally enlarged bedding \n\nplanes, to the NNE direction, according the potentiometric surface map and its flow directions (Fig. 9). \n\nSome waters could pass through dolomitic rocks being enriched of magnesium, with increased \n\nresidence time, which could indicate a dissolution zone storing waters for more period of time in that \n\nparticular area.  \n\nRegarding the basement, when it outcrops, there is an autogenic basement recharge, with \n\nwaters infiltrating in subvertical fractures. In some areas, where this basement is covered by other \n\nformations, there is an allogenic basement recharge, with waters passing through overlaying \n\nlithologies until reach the basement water table (Fig. 9). Waters from the basement (PT-78, 81, 86, 87 \n\nand 89), as well as close to the Santa Helena Ridge (PT-105) are more enriched in Mg\n2+\n\n. They can \n\nmix with waters more enriched in Ca\n2+\n\n and Na\n+\n, associated with limestones from the Sete Lagoas \n\nFormation, and dilute, influencing in their final composition types, seen in some samples located in the \n\nsouth (PT-81, 82), west (PT-90), and close to Santa Helena Ridge (PT-34, 47).  \n\nIn the central area, waters can also have some mixing with allogenic recharge from \n\nunconsolidated sediments that can reach the two main conduits. Occurrences of nitrate and isotopic \n\nevaporations evidence this type of local infiltration and superficial-ground water interconnections, such \n\nas local drainage and lakes. In the central urbanized area, the presence of the highest values of major \n\nions indicates more mineralization in the groundwater, suggesting large groundwater storage capacity. \n\nAccording to Galv\u00e3o et al. (in review), this region has the highest transmissivity values in Sete Lagoas, \n\nconsidered other evidence of karstification. \n\n\n\nChapter 8: Stable isotopes and geochemical studies to evaluate flowpaths and recharge areas   \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 115 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 9. A schematic water evolution conceptual model of Sete Lagoas, based on Galv\u00e3o et al. (in \npress). Autogenic recharge zones occurring when limestones outcrop, receiving rainfall waters by \nrunoff. When the karst aquifer receives waters from unconsolidated sediments or from basement, \nthere is an allogenic recharge. Some waters could pass through dolomitic rocks being enriched of \nmagnesium, with increased residence time. The majority of fluids migrate through dissolution features \ncharacterized as tertiary porosity developed in bedding planes (most frequent) and sometimes in sub-\nvertical fractures (less common). In the case of basement, waters fluid through subvertical fractures.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 8: Stable isotopes and geochemical studies to evaluate flowpaths and recharge areas   \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 116 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\n6. Conclusion \n\n \n\nGroundwaters in Sete Lagoas are the result of direct recharge from precipitation, during a \n\nlimited period from October to December. The recharging zones are mainly the sinkholes and caves \n\nentrances, as well as in areas where the limestones are covered by Cenozoic unconsolidated \n\nsediments. The majority of the fluids migrate through tertiary porosity, characterized by solutionally \n\nenlarged bedding planes and less common by sub-vertical enlarged fractures.  \n\nThe isotopic data in the lakes reflect evaporation processes, which combining with some \n\ngroundwater samples also with evaporation evidences, indicate some interconnections. Nitrate \n\noccurences can be interpreted as an evidence of local connections between surface waters and \n\ngroundwaters, corroborating with these isotopic data. Groundwaters from the basement, with the same \n\nisotopic signature in comparison to water from the karst aquifer also have the same origin, by \n\nprecipitation. \n\nThe majority of these groundwaters are classified as of Ca\n2+\n\n?HCO\n-\n3 type, associated to \n\nlimestones from the Sete Lagoas Formation. Waters in the basement and close to the Santa Helena \n\nRidge are enriched of Mg\n2+\n\n. These different types of water can mix with waters more enriched in Ca\n2+\n\n \n\nand Na\n+\n, diluting, resulting in other composition types. These mixing waters also indicate \n\ninterconnections between karst aquifer and basement waters. \n\nThe central urbanized area, where the Cenozoic unconsolidated sediments cover the \n\nlimestones, as well as in areas with sinkholes and cave entrances are located, are considered the \n\nmajor flowpaths for contaminants in Sete Lagoas. However, for the sinkhole and cave entrances \n\nregions, it is recommended directed studies to confirm this consideration. The occurrences of nitrate in \n\nthe central area exceeding 20 mg/L indicate that the stakeholders must protect these areas.  \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\n \n\nThis work was funded by Servmar Environmental &amp; Engineering and by S\u00e3o Paulo Research \n\nFoundation (FAPESP) [Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo] (process \n\n2012/12846-9).

For easy comprehensions, these \n\nconclusions are separated by subtopics, according to their importance.  \n\n \n\n9.1 Geological features of Sete Lagoas and surroundings \n\n \n\nThe city of Sete Lagoas and surroundings are along basement border, a result \n\nof extensional events in the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton, where silicate-carbonate \n\nsediments from the Neoproterozoic age were emplaced giving origin to the Bambu\u00ed \n\nGroup. Due to the relative proximity of the study area with the Serra do Espinha\u00e7o \n\n(the Serra do Espinha\u00e7o is situated to the east of the study area and had undergone \n\nintense deformation), the Bambu\u00ed Group presents a horst and graben system, \n\ncontrolled by faulting, displacing the stratigraphic sequences, which enables \n\nformations with different ages side by side. In the west of the area, the structural \n\nfeatures were less expressive and the sedimentary features were more preserved.  \n\nLithologies from the Belo Horizonte Complex basement, the Sete Lagoas \n\nFormation, the Serra de Santa Helena Formation, and Cenozoic unconsolidated \n\nsediments occur in the area. The Sete Lagoas and the Serra de Santa Helena \n\nformations follow the horst and graben system, presenting thinner layers on the basin \n\nborder in the SW region, and higher thickness in the NE area. The limestones from \n\nthe Sete Lagoas Formation dip and become thicker to the northeast, being covered \n\nalmost totally by competent rocks from the Serra de Santa Helena Formation (slate, \n\nmarble, siltstone, and argillite). These limestones arise mainly in the Santa Helena \n\nRidge foothills and in the municipalities located to the southeast of the city of Sete \n\nLagoas, near the Velhas River. The Serra de Santa Helena Formation is immediately \n\nover the Sete Lagoas Formation, with abrupt contact. The contacts with basement \n\nare also abrupt, with sediments deposited in area with little relief. This formation also \n\ndips and becomes thicker to the NE and thinner on the basin borders and near the \n\nVelhas River. The thickness of the sedimentary basin layers, in the NE portion of \n\nSete Lagoas, is estimated in 400 m, near this river. The limestones from the Sete \n\nLagoas Formation present horizontal continuity, from the basement border to the \n\nVelhas River.  \n\n\n\nChapter 9: Conclusions  \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 121 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nWithin the city of Sete Lagoas, limestones from the Sete Lagoas Formation had \n\nundergone dissolution process that most strongly affected the bedding planes of \n\nthese rocks, and, in lower magnitude, the sub-vertical fracture planes, forming karst \n\nconduits. Some of these dissolution zones were filled with terrigenous material. The \n\nmedium-grained Lagoa Santa Member had a higher degree of dissolution (e.g. dry \n\ncaves and grottoes) compared to the fine-grained lower Pedro Leopoldo Member \n\n(e.g. solutionally enlarged bedding planes). These evidences suggest \n\ngeomorphological processes, such as a past meteoric water flow, or have started at \n\nthe time when groundwater flowpaths started to develop, even if these limestones \n\nhad not yet been exposed. As the timing of these processes is not precisely known, it \n\nis recommended specific studies to be conducted for a better understanding about \n\nthe origin of these processes.  \n\nThe Santa Helena Ridge, in the central portion of the city, was interpreted as a \n\nhorst, which elevated the stratigraphic sequence, causing the Sete Lagoas and the \n\nSerra de Santa Helena formations to have higher altitudes than in other regions. \n\nConsidering that fracture filled quartz veins cut this stratigraphic sequence, the ridge \n\nbecame more resistant to erosion. The Cenozoic unconsolidated sediments \n\ndeposited in the central portion of Sete Lagoas were a result of weathering and \n\nerosion of Santa Helena Ridge rocks.  \n\n \n\n9.2 Hydrogeological features of the city of Sete Lagoas \n\n \n\nThe Sete Lagoas karst aquifer, which is approximately 75 meters thick on \n\naverage, consists of Neoproterozoic limestones, composed of two members: the \n\nPedro Leopoldo Member (at the base) and the Lagoa Santa Member (on the top), in \n\nwhich the primary porosity and matrix permeability can be considered very low and \n\nthe secondary porosity is mostly filled by the precipitation of calcite. The majority of \n\ngroundwater migrates through dissolution features characterized as tertiary porosity. \n\nThe urbanized area of Sete Lagoas is primarily located in an inferred graben, \n\nfilled with limestones from the Sete Lagoas Formation, with Cenozoic unconsolidated \n\nsediments, and occasionally covered by competent rocks from the Serra de Santa \n\nHelena Formation. This setting results in fault bounded barrier boundaries for \n\ngroundwater, which together with natural karst processes, explains the location of \n\ntwo dominant solutionally enlarged bedding planes with high permeability and \n\n\n\nChapter 9: Conclusions  \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 122 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nsignificant water storage capacity in the limestones: (1) a shallower and thicker \n\ncontinuous dissolution zone with conduits that are 1-8 m thick, near the contact with \n\nthe overlying unconsolidated sediments; and (2) 10-20 m below, a thinner continuous \n\ndissolution zone with conduits that are 20 cm to 1 m thick. These two bedding plane \n\nconduits become thinner to the northeast. \n\nRegarding the permeabilities of the karst aquifer, the solutionally enlarged \n\nbedding planes have the primary role in providing aquifer transmissivity. Unlike other \n\nkarst areas that have increases in permeability in scale effects from small- to \n\nregional-scale, this behavior does not happen in the Sete Lagoas karst aquifer. An \n\nincrease of about four to six orders of magnitude in the permeabilities from small- to \n\nwell-scale is common, but from well- to regional-scale, the values decrease, due to \n\nthe localized development of karst bedding plane dissolution in one structurally \n\ncontrolled region of the aquifer.  \n\nIn small-scale, the mean permeability of the matrix is very low, because it is \n\ncomposed of a Neoproterozoic fine-grained (Pedro Leopoldo Member, at the base) \n\nand a medium-grained (Lagoa Santa Member, on the top) limestone that undergone \n\nrecrystallization, with the secondary porosity (micro-fractures) generally filled by \n\ncalcite. Relative to the bedding plane features, these values can be approximated on \n\ntime scales for pumping or regional flow estimates as zero. \n\nAt the well-scale, the highest permeability features and groundwater storage are \n\nconcentrated in the central urbanized area and close to the Santa Helena Ridge \n\nfoothills, within the graben area, and in the East portion of the study area, with \n\ndecreases occurring to northeast direction. These data coincide with the thickness of \n\nthe karst bedding planes, suggesting a direct relationship between solutionally \n\nenlarged bedding planes and karst permeabilities. However, the Sete Lagoas karst \n\naquifer has some permeability characterized by zones of high karstification and \n\nstorage, which the standard well aquifer test is an insufficient method for estimation, \n\nevidenced by zero drawdown, illustrating the limits of aquifer tests. Non-Darcian flow \n\nlikely occurs in these wells.  \n\nAt the regional-scale, the permeability have a slightly smaller value in \n\ncomparison to the largest well-scale numbers, indicating that conduit permeability \n\nmay not be a strong regional effect if large conduits are not well connected on the \n\nscale of measurement. Both in well- and regional-scale, the largest permeabilities \n\noccur due to the same karstic conduits, but at the regional-scale, the permeability \n\n\n\nChapter 9: Conclusions  \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 123 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\nvalues of matrix are more incorporated in the overall regional scale resulting in \n\nsmaller values. Thus, in a low matrix permeability karst aquifer in which is governed \n\nby bedding planes and low sub-vertical fractures, the chance to have a considerable \n\nincrease in the scale effect from well- to regional-scale is considered low.  \n\n \n\n9.3 Groundwater evolution and source of recharges  \n\n \n\nThe groundwaters in Sete Lagoas are results of direct recharge from \n\nprecipitation, during a limited period from October to December. The recharging \n\nzones are mainly the sinkholes and caves entrances, as well as in areas where the \n\nlimestones are covered by Cenozoic unconsolidated sediments. The majority of the \n\nfluids migrate through the solutionally enlarged bedding planes and less common by \n\nsub-vertical enlarged fractures. The majority of these groundwaters are classified as \n\nof Ca\n2+\n\n?HCO\n-\n3 type, associated to limestones from the Sete Lagoas Formation. \n\nWaters in the basement and close to the Santa Helena Ridge are enriched of Mg\n2+\n\n. \n\nThese different types of water can mix with waters more enriched in Ca\n2+\n\n and Na\n+\n, \n\ndiluting, resulting in other composition types. These mixing waters also indicate \n\ninterconnections between waters from the karst aquifer and the basement.  \n\nIn the central urbanized area, where the karst aquifer is in contact with \n\nCenozoic unconsolidated sediments, and is more karstified, could have punctual \n\nsuperficial water infiltration. Isotopic results evidencing evaporation signatures in both \n\nlake water and groundwater samples, as well as nitrate in groundwater (in that last \n\ncase, indication of recent contamination by domestic sewage or septic tank), \n\ncorroborating this conclusion. Even in this region, high values of major ions indicating \n\nwater mineralization and, hence, higher groundwater storage capacity, which is in \n\nconcordance with the location of the highest transmissivity values and the most \n\nkarstic dissolution zones. \n\n \n\n9.4 Urban groundwater extraction and karst geotechnical risks  \n\n \n\nIn the urbanized area, the combination of unconsolidated sediments overlying \n\nlimestones or simple exposed limestone outcrops with two solutionally enlarged \n\nbedding planes in subsurface provided a geologic framework for geotechnical issues. \n\nIn that region, there is a cone of depression (dimensions of 8 km by 8.5 km = 68 km\n2\n) \n\n\n\nChapter 9: Conclusions  \n\n \n\nDoctoral Thesis 124 Galv\u00e3o, P.H.F.  \n\n \n\ncaused by high pumping rates in wells, estimated in 75,000 m\n3\n/d. During several \n\ndecades, since the first supply well drilled in 1942 until present, some areas had \n\nsignificant decreases in the water table, around 40 m lower due to pumping. In some \n\npoints, the shallowest conduit is entirely in the unsaturated zone. Depending on the \n\nsize and depth of the conduit and the thickness of the layers above, subsidence can \n\noccur causing depressions on the land surface or, in extreme situations, collapse. \n\nThis combination between geologic framework and high groundwater extraction \n\nexplains the emergence of the cluster of induced subsidence or collapse.  \n\nIn this area, largely located in the highest geotechnical risk zone, and where the \n\nmajority of the population is living, recommendations include reducing groundwater \n\nuse based on potentiometric surface elevation, prohibition to drilling new wells, \n\nprioritizing public wells to supply, and switching to surface water supply where \n\npossible. The main objective is to preserve groundwater resources to reduce the \n\nlocalized drawdown, which creates vadose conduits. Supply wells could be relocated \n\nto more protected areas, outside of that zone, avoiding future collapses.  \n\n \n\n9.5 General recommendations  \n\n \n\nThis doctoral thesis, from a hydraulic, geotechnical, and geochemical point of \n\nview, clarified important issues in regional scale, with punctual characterization in \n\nlocal scale. The multidisciplinary methodologies integrating geological, \n\nhydrogeological, geochemical, and isotopes studies that were used to understand the \n\nwater circulation in karst terrain, obtained satisfactory results, giving alternative \n\nresponses for a better use of water. However, specific questions remain without \n\nanswers, being interesting, in scientific terms and of water management, more \n\nclarified. Researches focusing on water flow system at the two main sollutionally \n\nenlarged bedding planes located in the urbanized area, where the majority of the \n\npopulation lives, are strongly recommended. Possible interconnections between \n\nthese conduits, calculating the hydraulic parameters independently, determining the \n\napparent age of the waters separately, and estimating the preferential groundwater \n\nflowpaths should be evaluated. These studies could contribute in the improvement of \n\nthe hydrogeological conceptual model in more detail, giving clarifications in terms of \n\ngroundwater flowpaths and its storages, contamination vulnerabilities, among others, \n\nimproving the groundwater management."}]}}}
