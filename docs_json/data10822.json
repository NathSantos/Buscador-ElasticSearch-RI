PAULA(1), Elerson GAETTI-JARDIM Jr.(2) &amp; Mario J. AVILA-CAMPOS(3)\n\nSUMMARY\n\nFusobacterium nucleatum is a strict anaerobe and is indigenous of the human oral cavity. This organism is commonly recovered\nfrom different monomicrobial and mixed infections in humans and animals. In this study, the plasmid profile, the plasmid stability\nand the penicillin-resistance association in oral F. nucleatum isolated from periodontal patients, healthy subjects and Cebus apella\nmonkeys were evaluated. Forty-five F. nucleatum strains from patients, 38 from healthy subjects and seven from C. apella were\nidentified and analyzed. Plasmid extraction was performed in all the isolated strains. These elements were found in 26.7% strains\nfrom patients and one strain from C. apella. Strains from healthy subjects did not show any plasmid. Most of strains showed two\nplasmid bands ranging from 4 to 16 Kb, but digestions with endonucleases showed that they belonged to a single plasmid. The\nplasmid profile was similar and stable in human and monkey strains. Also, plasmids were classified into three groups according to\nsize. Two strains were positive to ?-lactamase production and no plasmid DNA-hybridization with a ?-lactamase gene probe was\nobserved, suggesting a chromosomal resistance.\n\nKEYWORDS: Plasmid; Gene; Fusobacterium nucleatum; Cebus apella.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nFusobacterium nucleatum is a Gram-negative rod, non-spore-\nforming, non-motile and a strictly anaerobic organism. This bacterium\nis indigenous of the human and animal oral cavity, and has been involved\nin several infectious processes such as sinusitis, osteomyelitis, brain or\nliver abscesses2,3. Also, F. nucleatum is a putative pathogen involved in\nthe development of gingivitis in children and adults and of periodontitis\nin juveniles and adults5,11.\n\nDespite the large knowledge about the pathogenic potential and\nmedical aspects of fusobacteria, their metabolic and genetic aspects are\nlittle known6. In the last years, the use of tools as cloning, sequencing\nand PCR have given more information about the genetic aspects of F.\nnucleatum2,5.\n\nIn other microbial groups, several virulence factors have been\nobserved and these factors can be mediated by extrachromosomal DNA\nelements carrying genes able to synthesize substances destroying host\ntissues. These factors play an important role in ecological terms,\nregulating or limiting many microorganisms in their ecosystems. The\npresence of plasmids in F. nucleatum has already been reported10.\n\nIn this study, the plasmid profile in oral F. nucleatum isolated from\nperiodontal patients, health subjects and Cebus apella monkeys, the\n\nplasmid stability and the penicillin-resistance genes association with\nplasmids were evaluated. Monkeys were used because of anatomic\nsimilarities with the human oral cavity.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n1. Bacterial isolation and identification: Subgingival plaque\nsamples from 30 patients with adult periodontitis (age range 18-40 years)\nfrom the Periodontology Clinic of Dentistry School, University of S\u00e3o\nPaulo (SP, Brazil), without sex or race distinction, with clinic and\nradiographic evidences of periodontitis, including periodontal pockets\n? 5 mm were collected. None of them received antibiotics for at least\nsix-month prior to the sample collection. Subgingival dental plaques\nfrom 30 periodontally healthy dental students (age range 19-35 years),\nwithout sex or race distinction, and without evidences of periodontal\ndisease, were collected. Healthy students did not take antimicrobials six\nmonth prior to the sample collection. Also, subgingival plaques from\nten Cebus apella monkeys (Experimental Center for Macaco-Prego,\nUNESP, S\u00e3o Paulo, SP) without evidences of periodontal disease were\ncollected, after injected with Nembutal?1.\n\nSamples were dispersed by vortex for 60 seconds and serial dilutions\nwere performed. Aliquots of 0.1 ml of each dilution were transferred\nonto blood agar and OMATA &amp; DISRAELY agar13, and incubated in\natmosphere with 90% N\n\n2\n + 10% CO\n\n2\n, at 37 oC, for 4 days.\n\n\n\n6\n\nPAULA, M.O.; GAETTI-JARDIM Jr., E. &amp; AVILA-CAMPOS, M.J. - Plasmid profile in oral Fusobacterium nucleatum from humans and Cebus apella monkeys. Rev. Inst. Med. trop. S.\nPaulo, 45(1):5-9, 2003.\n\nBacterial identification was performed according to BENNETT &amp;\nDUERDEN3, HOLT et al.7 and SUMMANEN et al.20. Reference strains\nF. nucleatum ATCC 10953 and F. nucleatum ATCC 25586 were included\nin all the tests. Identified strains were stored in glycerol (20%, -70 oC)\nand lyophilized.\n\n2. Plasmid profile and stability: Plasmid DNA extraction was\nperformed using a PANTOSTI et al.14 method. Briefly, 5 ml of culture\nin BHI broth supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract (BHIS, Difco\nLaboratories) were centrifuged (5,000 x g, 5 minutes) (Jouan, model\nA-14), and the pellet washed in TES buffer (50 mM Tris, 50 mM Na Cl,\n5 mM EDTA), resuspended in 100 \u00b5g of solution I (25 mM Tris, 50 mM\nglucose, 10 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) with 2 mg/ml of lysozyme (Amresco)\nand incubated at 37 oC, for 15 minutes. 200 \u00b5l of solution II (0.2 N\nNaOH, 1% SDS) were added to tubes, and incubated on ice for\n5 min. Then, 150 \u00b5l of solution III (3M sodium acetate, pH 4.8) were\nadded and incubated on ice for 15 min. After centrifugation (10,000 x g,\n15 minutes, Eppendorf, model 5402), the supernatant was treated with\nequal volumes of phenol: chloroform (1:1). Aqueous phase was\nprecipitated with 2 volumes of cold ethanol and stored at \u201320 oC, for\n30 minutes. After centrifugation (10,000 x g, 15 minutes), the pellet was\ndried and resuspended in 40 \u00b5l of TE buffer (10 mM sodium acetate,\n1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) with 20 \u00b5g/ml of RNase (10 mg/ml) and incubated\nat room temperature for 30 min. Obtained DNA was stored at \u201320 oC.\nAlso, 10 \u00b5l of DNA were run in a 0.7% agarose gel (type II, Sigma) by\nelectrophoresis in 0.5 X TBE buffer (1 M Tris, 0.9 M Boric acid, 0.01 M\nEDTA, pH 8.4). DNA extraction for each strain was three times repeated.\nPlasmid molecular weights were estimated by comparison with the\nstandard weight Supercoiled DNA Ladder (Gibco BRL).\n\nFor evaluation of the plasmid stability, plasmid-positive strains were\nsubmitted to 50 successive cultures in BHIS, with intervals of 48-72 h.\nPlasmid extraction was performed every 10 subcultures as described\nabove14.\n\n3. ?-lactamase production: The ?-lactamase production by\npenicillin-resistant strains was evaluated. Briefly, strains were grown in\n5 ml of BHIS, and after 20 \u00b5l were inoculated, in duplicate, onto BHIS\nagar with penicillin G (Wyeth Laboratories) in concentrations ranging\nfrom 1 to 64 \u00b5g/ml. Inoculated plates were incubated in anaerobiosis, at\n37 oC, for 72 h. Bacterial growth were treated with chloroform vapors\nfor 20 minutes, then plates were opened for 20 minutes until chloroform\nevaporation. After, 5.0 ml of semi-solid BHIS (0.7% agar) inoculated\nwith 0.1 ml of F. nucleatum ATCC 10953 (susceptible to penicillin G)\nwere pour-plated. Plates were incubated in anaerobiosis, at 37 oC, for\n48 h. ?-lactamase production was observed by a growth halo around of\nthe producer strain.\n\n4. Plasmid DNA restriction and Southern blot: Plasmid DNA\nwas extracted by using two based BIRNBOIM &amp; DOLY4 protocols with\nmodifications, where several precipitations with sodium acetate and cold\nethanol, and additional treatments with phenol and phenol-chloroform\nwere performed. All the isolated strains were grown into 200 ml of BHIS.\nA Wizard Plus Maxipreps DNA Purification System (Promega) was also\nused in accordance to the manufacturer indications. Lyses method by\nboiling and plasmid purification by cesium-chlorate-ethidium bromide\n(CsCl-EtBr) gradient were also used according to SAMBROOK et al.18.\nAll DNA samples were purified by using a Sequenase Sequencing System\n\nprotocol (DNA was dissolved in 0.4 ml of ultra pure Milli-Q water,\n0.1 ml of 4 M NaCl and 0.5 ml of 13% PEG\n\n8000\n. After homogenization,\n\ntubes were incubated at 4 oC, for 30 minutes, and centrifuged at 10,000\nx g, for 15 minutes. DNA was dried at room temperature and resuspended\nin TE buffer).\n\n0.1 \u00b5g to 0.5 \u00b5g of DNA samples were restricted overnight with\nendonucleases: BamH I, Bgl II, EcoR I, Hinc II, Hind III, Pst I and Sal\nI (New England Biolabs) according to manufacturer. Plasmid molecular\nfragments weights were determined by using a lambda DNA-Hind III\ndigested as a standard weight (New England Biolabs) and an Eagle-Eye\nprogram.\n\n4.1. Probe to ?-lactamase: ?-lactamase gene probe from pUC18\nplasmid ampicillin-resistance gene was obtained18. Plasmid pUC18 was\nrestricted with Sca I and Bsa I, producing a 2.3 Kb and 0.4 Kb bands. The\n0.4 Kb band was eluted and purified by using a PrepA Gene? System protocol\n(Life Science Research Products Bio-Rad), and a DIG-DNA Labeling and\nDetection Kit (Boehringer Mannheim) was used as probe marker.\n\n4.2. Southern blot: Plasmid samples from penicillin-resistant F.\nnucleatum were obtained. Also, a DNA from Saccharomyces cerevisiae\nstrain IH # 1784 (Herskowitz, I., Univ. California, San Francisco, USA)\nas a negative control, a plasmid pUC18 as a positive control, and a\nstandard 1 Kb DNA Ladder (Gibco BRL) were used.\n\nThe membrane transference using a nylon membrane (Zeta-Probe\nBlotting Membrane - Life Science Research Products Bio-Rad) in a\nvacuum blotting system (Pharmacia, LKB, Biotechnology) was\nperformed. A denature solution (1.5 M NaCl, 0.5 M NaOH) was added\nfor 20 minutes and then, a neutralizing solution (1.5 M NaCl, 0.5 M\nTris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1.0 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) was used for 20 min.\nTransference was performed changing the neutralizing solution for a\ntransference solution (20 X SSC, 3 M NaCl, 0.3 M Tri-sodium citrate,\npH 7.0), for 1 h. Membrane was washed in 10 X SSC solution and dried\non filter paper at room temperature, and DNA was fixed with UV light\nfor 3 min.\n\n4.3. Hybridization: Nylon membrane was pre-hybridized with\n20 ml of pre-hybridization solution (5X SSC, 0.1% N-laurosilsarcosine,\n0.02% SDS, 1% blocking reagent from DIG-DNA labeling and detection\nkit), at 65 oC, for 3 h using a hybridization machine (Hybaid Model\nMaxi 14). This solution was discarded and 20 ml of pre-hybridization\nsolution with 100 ng/\u00b5l of a denatured ?-lactamase probe (100 oC,\n10 minutes) were added, and hybridization was performed overnight.\nMembrane was washed twice with a washing solution I (2X SSC, 0.1%\nSDS) for 5 min, at room temperature. Washing solution II (0.1X SSC,\n0.1% SDS) was used twice for additional washing, at 65 oC, for\n15 minutes. Membrane was dried and revelation was performed. Another\nhybridization at low stringent conditions was also performed.\n\nRESULTS\n\nBacterial isolation: Forty-five oral F. nucleatum from periodontal\npatients, 38 from health subjects and 7 from C. apella monkeys were\nobtained.\n\nPlasmid profile and stability: Plasmids were observed in 12 out of\n\n\n\nPAULA, M.O.; GAETTI-JARDIM Jr., E. &amp; AVILA-CAMPOS, M.J. - Plasmid profile in oral Fusobacterium nucleatum from humans and Cebus apella monkeys. Rev. Inst. Med. trop. S.\nPaulo, 45(1):5-9, 2003.\n\n7\n\n45 strains (26.7%) from periodontal patients and in 1 out of 7 strains\nfrom C. apella monkeys. All the strains showed two plasmid bands except\nstrain D82 that showed four bands. Bands were approximately between\n4 Kb and ? 16 Kb (Table 1). Strains harboring plasmids were recovered\nfrom different patients, except strains D40 and D41, which belonged to\na single patient. No strain from healthy subjects harbored plasmids. Also,\nthe plasmid profile of the monkey strain (M6) was similar to the human\nstrains (D33, D40 and D41). Isolates D6, D33, D40 and D82 from\nperiodontal patients showed plasmids, but these strains were lost during\nmaintenance and were not used for plasmid DNA analysis.\n\nTable 2 shows the plasmid presence during subcultures at different\ntimes. Reference strain F. nucleatum ATCC 10953 did not show any\nplasmids. In the other strains, plasmids appeared at least twice or more\ntimes, showing the same molecular weight during subcultures.\n\n?-lactamase production: Two penicillin-resistant human strains (D1\nand D12) produced ?-lactamase enzyme.\n\nPlasmid DNA restriction: Plasmid-positive strains (D1, D3, D12,\nD17, D41, D81, D84, D513, D518 and M6) were submitted for a maxi-\npreps DNA extraction. Sometimes, a small DNA amount or no DNA or\ndegraded DNA was observed. No DNA sample was obtained with CsCl\ngradient method.\n\nDNA from strains D1, D12, and D81 were restricted with EcoR I,\nand from D17 and D513 with Hinc II. EcoR I partially digested DNA\nfrom strains D1, producing a 4.2 Kb band (Fig. 2), and D12 or D81,\nproducing a 5.8 Kb and 0.8 Kb bands (Fig. 1). Hinc II restricted DNA\nfrom strain D17 producing a 3.1 Kb, 2.3 Kb and 1.1 Kb bands (Fig. 2),\nand from D513, only a 6.0 Kb band. Endonucleases BamH I, Bgl II,\nHind III, Pst I and Sal I did not digest any DNA sample.\n\nHybridization: Plasmid DNA from penicillin-resistant (D1 and D12)\nor susceptible (D81 and D17) F. nucleatum did not hybridize with ?-\nlactamase probe. Similar results were observed when hybridization was\nperformed at low stringent conditions.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nExtrachromosomal elements such as plasmids have been observed\nin several bacterial species. These genetic elements may change the\nbacterial physiologic properties increasing its pathogenic potential,\naffecting the taxonomic position and spreading its properties to other\nbacterial species.\n\nThe presence of plasmids observed in oral F. nucleatum strains\nisolated from periodontal patients and its absence in healthy subjects\n\nTable 2\nPresence of plasmids in nine oral F. nucleatum during 50 subcultures\n\nStrain  Presence of plasmid\n\n1o 10o 20o 30o 40o 50o\n\nD1 + + - - + +\nD12 + + + + + -\nD17 + + + + + +\nD41 + - - - + -\nD81 + + - + + -\nD84 + + - - + +\n\nD513 + + + + - -\nD518 + + + - + -\nM6 + + - + + -\n\nATCC 10953* - - - - - -\n\n+: Presence of plasmid; -: No plasmid; D: Periodontal patient strain; M: C.\napella monkey strain; * Reference strain F. nucleatum ATCC 10953\n\nTable 1\nPresence of plasmids in 12 oral F. nucleatum recovered from periodontal\n\npatients (D) and one from C. apella monkey (M)\n\n Strain  Plasmid bands\n\n Number  Size\n\nD1, D6 2 6.5 Kb\n4.5 Kb\n\nD12, D17, D81, D84, D513, D518 2 11 Kb\n6.5 Kb\n\nD33, D40, D41 2 16 Kb\n12 Kb\n\nD82 4 16 Kb\n10 Kb\n\n7.5 Kb\n4.5 Kb\n\nM6 2 > 16 Kb\n12 Kb\n\nFig. 1 - Agarose gel electrophoresis of plasmid DNA from F. nucleatum.

Rev. Inst. Med. trop. S.\nPaulo, 45(1):5-9, 2003.\n\nsuggest an association with some pathogenic factors. McKAY et al.10\n\nreported the presence of plasmids (ranged from 6.0 to 6.6 Kb) in 18% of\nthe tested F. nucleatum isolated from periodontal patients and healthy\nsubjects, without distinction among both studied groups, and these\nelements were considered cryptic. This is the only report of plasmids in\nthis group.\n\nPlasmids were observed in 26.7% of the F. nucleatum recovered\nfrom periodontal patients and in one (14%) out of seven strains recovered\nfrom C. apella monkeys. However, no F. nucleatum recovered from\nhealthy subjects harbored plasmids. Plasmid profile in the animal strain\nwas similar to the human strains, suggesting a possible microbial cross-\ntransmission by water or food (among animals and keep-staff). On the\nother hand, studies using a larger number of monkey and keep-staff strains\nwould be necessary to obtain any definitive conclusion.\n\nMost of tested F. nucleatum was susceptible to penicillin G. However,\nstrains D1 and D12 were resistant to penicillin (256 \u00b5g/ml), maybe due\nto a ?-lactamase production. Studies have reported a ?-lactamase\nproduction in F. nucleatum, but no gene has been identified8,12,22,23,24.\nAlso, that high resistance observed in both strains (D1 and D12) suggests\nthe presence of any penicillin-resistance marker such as a plasmid or a\nchromosomal gene. Bacterial plasmids codifying for antimicrobial\nresistance have been frequently observed16,17,19,21.\n\nThe ?-lactamase production for strains D1 and D2 by chromosomal\nor plasmid genes was detected by using a hybridization assay with a ?-\nlactamase gene probe, and no hybridization was observed suggesting\n\nthat ?-lactamase production was chromosomally mediated or the used\nprobe from pUC18 did not show any homology with genes belonging to\nFusobacterium spp. Most of sequenced ?-lactamases genes from different\nbacterial groups, such as Salmonella, Klebsiella, Mycobacterium,\nLysobacter, Nocardia and Streptomyces, showed some homology (>\n55%) with Escherichia coli genes (GenBank data). On the other hand,\nLIVERMORE9 showed differences among ?-lactamases mediated for\nplasmid and chromosome. In Bacteroides fragilis, plasmid genes\nproducing ?-lactamases may be different from those observed in\nenterobacteria or other aerobic Gram-negative bacteria 16.\n\nPresence of plasmid was stable during bacterial subcultures, but these\nelements were present or absent in some DNA extractions, suggesting\nthat technical problems can be a trouble in plasmid isolation and\nobservation. The Mini-prep and Maxi-prep plasmid DNA extraction\nprotocols were used, but the DNA amounts obtained in Mini-prep where\nsmall and enough only to visualize Max-prep protocols didn\u2019t get enough\nDNA in all strains for endonucleases digestion. Also, sometimes the\nDNA was degrated. This DNA degradation might be due to DNase\nenzymes produced by F. nucleatum15. McKAY et al.10 also reported that\nsmall DNA amounts are commonly recovered from this microbial group.\n\nIn this study, only EcoR I and Hinc II were able to restrict plasmid\nDNA from the tested F. nucleatum. The same endonucleases restricted\nthe plasmids isolated by McKAY et al.10. Also, endonucleases BamH I,\nBgl II, Hind III, Pst I and Sal I, did not digest any isolated plasmid. In\naddition, BamH I, Pst I and Sal I recognize sites rich in G and also did\nnot restricted McKAY et al. isolated plasmids. It is well known that F.\nnucleatum has a low G + C content (27% - 28%), and it might explain\nwhy these enzymes were not able to restrict plasmid from F. nucleatum.\n\nPlasmid DNA from strains D12 and D81 were restricted with EcoR\nI and produced two 5.8 and 0.8 Kb bands, suggesting a true molecular\nweight of approximately 6.6 Kb. Also, the two observed bands  in the\nintact plasmid with sizes between 10 and 12 Kb, and between 6 and 7\nKb, belong to a single plasmid, but in two different forms. Plasmid from\nstrain D17 was restricted with Hinc II and three bands with approximately\n3.1, 2.3 and 1.1 Kb were observed, suggesting a molecular weight of\n6.5 Kb. Plasmid DNA from strain D513 was restricted with Hinc II in a\nunique site, producing an approximately 6.0 Kb band. Our data show\nthat strains D12, D81, D17 and D513 harbored plasmids with similar\nsize (Table 1). Plasmid from strains D12 and D81 showed two common\nsites for Eco RI, while plasmids from strains D17 and D513 showed a\ndifferent restriction profile. Also, a partial DNA digestion from strain\nD1 was obtained with EcoR I, producing a 4.2 Kb band (whole plasmid\nsize).\n\nAfter restriction analysis, plasmids were grouped according to their\nmolecular weight: group I, approximately 4.2 Kb; group II, between 6.0\nand 6.6 Kb; and group III, between 12 and 16 Kb. Plasmids from group\nIII were not digested due to the small DNA amount obtained. In addition,\nplasmids belonging to the second group were also reported by McKAY\net al.10, but no function was observed.\n\nCertainly, these results indicate the need of a better plasmid\ncharacterization of the F. nucleatum species identifying their genetic content\nand determining in ecologic and pathogenic terms the role that these elements,\nstill considered cryptic, could play in human periodontal processes.\n\nFig. 2 - Agarose gel electrophoresis of plasmid DNA from F. nucleatum.
