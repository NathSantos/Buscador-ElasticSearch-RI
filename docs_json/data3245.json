Its mass spectrum differs from P. aeruginosa spectrum, indicating that the surface\ntension reducing substances produced by P. citronellolis can be a new kind of biosurfactant.\n\nKey words: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, rhamnolipid mixture, ESI mass spectrum, biosurfactant\n\nWe have recently reported a bacterial isolate Pseudomonas\ncitronellolis 222A as a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-\ndegrading bacteria and biosurfactant producer (6). This bacterium\nbelongs to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa group, from the\nPseudomonadaceae family and it was initially reported by Seubert\n(12) as an isoprenoid-degrading bacterium. More recently, P.\ncitronellolis was isolated from soil as a hydrocarbon-degrading\nbacterial strain, which metabolizes citronellol (isoprenoid) and\ncan also degrade the toxic hydrocarbon constituents present in\noily sludge (3). In a further study we reported that P. citronellolis\n222A showed the highest reduction of surface tension as\ncompared with P. aeruginosa isolates and the addition of a\nsoluble source of iron decreased surface tension (11). P.\ncitronellolis 222A isolate showed a direct dependence on iron\nto stimulate surface tension reducing substances production\nthat increased anthracene biodegradation (11). For Bacillus\nsubtilis, Wei and Chu (13) reported that supplementation of iron\nenabled overproduction of a biosurfactant surfactin and\nincreased biomass growth of this bacterium in a dose dependent\nmanner. More recently, Wei et al. (14) verified addition of iron\nsulfate increased markedly surfactin production initially, but\nfurther iron addition led to a decrease in the concentration of\nsurfactin, most likely due to acidification of the culture and\n\nconsequent precipitation of surfactin. To our knowledge, the\nwork of Santos et al., (11) showing the effect of iron on surfactant\nproduction by a Pseudomonas citronellolis was firstly reported\non the literature. Despite that P. citronellolis belongs to the\nPseudomonas aeruginosa group, we are considering the\npresence of a different surfactant structure as compared to the\nrhamnolipid produced by P. aeruginosa sp. In this work, we did\nthe investigation on the structure of the iron-stimulated surface\ntension reducing substances produced by P. citronellolis 222A\nas compared to the structure of rhamolipid produced by P.\naeruginosa LBI isolated from a petroleum-contaminated soil.\n\nPseudomonas citronellolis (isolate 222A) is a PAH-\ndegrading bacteria and biosurfactant producer identified by\n16S rRNA gene sequencing by Jacques et al. (6). It was isolated\nfrom 17-years old soil that was used for sludge treatment from\npetrochemical industries and oil refinery. P. aeruginosa LBI\nwas isolated from petroleum-contaminated soil as previously\ncharacterized by Benincasa et al. (1) and its surfactant was\nused for structure comparison. For surfactant production, the\nisolate 222A was inoculated with an initial population of 2.0\u00b10.2\nLog CFU mL-1 in mineral medium (MM) (50 mL) as described by\nJacques et al. (6), containing 250 mg L-1 of anthracene (three\nreplicates) in the absence (control) and presence of 0.1 mM\n\n*Corresponding Author. Mailing address: Av.

Surfactant production was estimated by the\nemulsification index and by the reduction of the surface tension.\nEmulsification evaluation was performed by the presence and\nabsence of cells into the MM (cells were removed by\ncentrifugation at 10,000 rpm by 30 min, at 4\u00baC). Two mL of MM\nwere mixed with diesel oil in a pirex glass tube (100 mm x 15 mm)\nusing a vortex for 2 minutes. After that, the tubes were kept\nresting for 24 hours and then the volume and the stability of the\nemulsion were measured. The surface tension of the MM was\nmeasured in the absence of cells after samples equilibration (1h\nat 25\u00baC), using a model Lecont Du Nouy tensiometer. Sterile\nmineral medium was used as control (69.2 mM m-1). Surface\ntension reducing substances were extracted from culture media\nafter cell removal by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 20 min. The\nsupernatant pH was adjusted to 2.0 with 6N H2SO4, and an\nequal volume of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1) was added. The mixture\nwas vigorously shaken for 5 min and allowed to set until phase\nseparation. The organic phase was removed and the operation\nwas repeated. The extracted product was concentrated from\nthe pooled organic phases using a rotary evaporator. The\nviscous yellowish product obtained was dissolved in methanol\nand concentrated again by evaporation of the solvent at 45\u00baC,\naccording to Costa et al. (4). Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass\nspectra were recorded on a high-resolution Q-Tof (Micromass,\nU.K.) mass spectrometer with a quadrupole (Qq) orthogonal\ntime-of-flight configuration using operating conditions\ndescribed in details elsewhere (4). The ESI mass spectrum in\nthe negative ion mode was acquired using a capillary voltage of\n-3.5 kV, a cone voltage of 35 V and desolvatation gas (nitrogen)\nwas heated to 100\u00baC. ESI tandem mass spectra were acquired\nby mass-selecting the target ion using the quadrupole mass\nanalyzer followed by 25eV, collision induced dissociation using\nnitrogen in collision cell. The material was dissolved in methanol:\nwater (1:1 v/v), filtered (0.22 mm) and introduced into the source\nat 15 ml min-1 with a syringe pump.\n\nAfter 48 days of incubation into mineral medium containing\n250 mg L-1 of anthracene P. citronellolis 222A isolate reduced\nsurface tension from 69.2 to 36.2 mM m-1. Addition of 0.1 mM of\nFe-Fe(NO3)3 to the medium increased the reduction of surface\ntension to 26.0 mM m-1, as reported by Santos et al. (11), being\none of the smallest values reported in the literature, only compared\nto the surfactin produced by B. subtilis (14). This reduction was\nassociated to the increase of the anthracene availability and\nconsequently, increase of anthracene degradation (28%)\nestimated by gas chromatography (CG-MS), as compared with\nthe result in the absence of iron. Beyond anthracene, iron addition\nat 0.1 mM Fe(NO3)3 increased the growth of the P. citronellolis\n222A isolate living into a medium containing pyrene, phenantrene,\ngasoline and diesel oil. Emulsification was not detected in our\nwork, indicating that the P. citronellolis 222A do not produce\nhigh molecular weight surfactant as a bioemulsificant.\n\nMass spectroscopy analysis of the rhamnolipid produced\nby P. aeruginosa LBI yielded an ESI mass spectrum with a\npredominant peak at m/z 649 and a second major component at\nm/z 503, which corresponds to the deprotonated molecules [M-\nH]\u2013 of the dirhamnolipid (Rha2C10C10) and the monorhamnolipid\n(RhaC10C10), respectively (Figure 1A). These are biosurfactants\nfrequently produced by P. aeruginosa and more studied and\nfound in literature (1,4,5,8). In fact, ESI-MS detected a\nrhamnolipid mixture produced by this Pseudomonas with the\npresence of other components (m/z 621, m/z 677) (Fig. 1A).\nPseudo-molecular ions above 621 probably represent fragments\nof the molecules of monorhamnolipids and dirhamnolipid (9). P.\naeruginosa frequently produce a mixture of biosurfactants.\nD\u00e9ziel et al. (5) identified the presence of the 21 types of\nrhamnolipids when P. aeruginosa 57RP grew using mannitol as\nunique source of carbon.\n\nIn our work, the same situation was observed with P.\ncitronellolis 222A which also produced a mixture of substances\nwith surface tension reducing proprieties (Fig. 1B). The\nsubstances extraction was not possible in the presence of iron,\nprobably due to some chemical interference on extraction. In\nthe absence of iron, the ESI-MS analysis of the reducing surface\ntension substances mixtures produced by P. citronellolis 222A\nrevealed compounds of small m/z. The major component was\npseudo-molecular ions at m/z 341 and two higher peaks detected\nas the anions of m/z 339 and 255; this indicates a production of\ncomponents differents of P. aeruginosa pattern. Microorganisms\nsynthesize a wide variety of low-molecular-mass biosurfactants\n(10). They are mainly rhamnolipids, trehaloselipids,\nsophorolipids, viscosin, surfactin, gramicidins, polymyxins,\nserrawettin, lipopeptides (10). However, bacterial cells can\nproduce a large variety of surface tension reducing substances\nsuch as peptides, fatty acids, phospholipids and also antibiotics,\nthat have low molecular mass than the named low-molecular-\nmass biosurfactants (7). In the ESI mass spectrum produced by\nP. citronellolis 222A it is possible to find structures similar to\nrhamnolipids produced by P. aeruginosa, as the anion of m/z\n311 corresponds to a molecule with two rhamnoses (Rha2) could\nindicate a production of dirhamnolipids by P. citronellolis (2).\n\nVariations in the chemical structure of biosurfactants have\nbeen reported by several authors (1,7,10). These variations are\nobviously associated to species of bacteria that produce the\nbiosurfactant, as well as variations in analytical methodologies\nused to characterize the molecules and growth conditions (5,9).\nDeziel et al. (5) show that the rhamnolipids produced by P.\naeruginosa 57RP differs both in quantity and in structure\ndepending on if the carbon source in mineral medium was\nmannitol or naphthalene. The most of the works in the literature\nuse glycerol or vegetable oils (soybean, olive, sunflower, corn)\nas unique source of carbon to grow biosurfactant-producing\nmicroorganisms. To our knowledge, this is the first report about\nthe structural characterization of surface tension reducing\n\n\n\nSurface tension reducing substances of P. citronellolis\n\n355\n\nsubstances produced in anthracene. This in part could explain\nthe differences between ESI mass spectrum of P. aeruginosa\nand P. citronellolis. It was observed that surface tension\nreducing substances produced by P. citronellolis structurally\nseem to be different of typical rhamnolipids produced by P.\naeruginosa, which indicates the necessity of new studies\n(nuclear magnetic resonance, for example) aiming to identify\ncompletely the structures of these substances, which can be a\nnew kind of biosurfactant.\n\nRESUMO\n\nAn\u00e1lise por espectrometria de massa de subst\u00e2ncias\nredutoras da tens\u00e3o superficial produzidas por uma\ncepa de Pseudomonas citronellolis degradadora de\n\nhidrocarbonetos arom\u00e1ticos polic\u00edclicos\n\nNeste trabalho \u00e9 apresentado um estudo a respeito da an\u00e1lise\nda estrutura de subst\u00e2ncias redutoras de tens\u00e3o superficial\nproduzidas por Pseudomonas citronellolis 222A estimulado\n\npela presen\u00e7a de ferro.
