Deep-water sharks \npopulations have been of the most disturbed by practices \nof unselected fisheries, bycatch and discard, mainly due \nto their low commercial value. Those practices make \ndeep-water sharks very vulnerable to overfishing given \ntheir life-history traits, increasing their extinction risk.  \nWith the prohibition of the direct fishery, and \nimplementation of quotas and TACs (Total Allowable \nCatches) regarding the deep-sea shark landings, the \nofficial landings have dramatically decreased after the \n1990s. However, the IUU (Illegal, unreported and \nunregulated) catch has exponentially increased.  \nWith the analysis of catch per unit effort (CPUE), the \ndepths, and the mean weight of the individuals over the \nyears for each one of the nine most caught species in the \nAzores, we produced a descriptive analysis of the effect \nof fisheries in those species. \nThe results show that some of these species have been \nsuffering from a great fishing pressure, and their \npopulations will be greatly affected in the near future if \ndrastic measures are not taken when it comes to \nmanaging their long term sustainability.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n XIV \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n XV \n\n \n\nINDEX \n\n \n\n \n\n1.

INTRODUCTION \n\n  \n\n Fishing is the economic activity with the greatest impacts on the marine \n\nenvironment, and due to that, the effects of fishing have generated great concern \n\namong scientists, the civil society in general, and the fishing industry. In result of \n\nthe substantial world population growth, there is a higher demand for food, \n\nincluding fish protein (Turner, Thrush et al. 1999; Agardy 2000), and the Food and \n\nAgriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) reported that, just to \n\naccommodate human needs, worldwide fisheries production in marine waters was \n\nof 79.7 million tonnes in 2012 (FAO, 2014). These fisheries affect not only the \n\ntarget species and resources, but also other marine species because of poor \n\nselectivity, and lead to practices such as bycatch and discard, which also disturb \n\nthe surrounding environment and ecological processes at very large scales \n\n(Garcia, Zerbi et al. 2003). Bycatch of non-target species and their discard is today \n\nseen as a serious problem in all world's oceans. \n\n \n\n1.1. Bycatch and discards \n\n \n\n Bycatch can be defined as incidental catch of non target species, or target \n\nspecies with undesirable sizes or age, without any direct effort towards those \n\nspecies, while the discard is the portion of the catch that is not retained on board. \n\nDiscard occurs mainly because of the lack of commercial value of bycatch and, \n\ndepending on each fisherman and on the location of the fisheries, undesirable \n\ncatches can be returned to the sea or thrown away (Gilman, Passfield et al. 2012). \n\nEven though they are related, these two concepts have different ecologic and \n\neconomic impacts: bycatch affects several species but can be turned into profit \n\nand discarded species are a waste of valuable resources but can be useful to \n\nscavengers and seabirds (COFREPECHE and SCAPECHE, 2014; Sanchez, \n\nDemestre et al. 2004; Morandeau, Macher et al. 2014; Borges, Erzini et al. 2001). \n\n\n\n 12 \n\nThe impacts of these practices not only affect directly the populations of captured \n\nspecies, but also indirectly disturb the structure and function of the ecosystems in \n\nwhich they thrive (Borges, Erzini et al. 2001; Monteiro, Araujo et al. 2001; \n\nJennings and Kaiser, 2000). Indirect effects on trophic interactions, through the \n\ndepletion of the top predators for example, can affect the entire community \n\nfunction (Stevens, Bonfil et al. 2000; Hall, Alverson et al. 2000). Discarding \n\npractices can also benefit the population of scavenging species and disrupt \n\necosystem processes (Garthe and Scherp, 2003). The populations of scavenging \n\nbirds in the North Sea, for instance, have been growing exponentially due to the \n\nvast access to the fisheries waste, that can be a very important part of their diet, \n\nsince they consume about 50% of the material that is returned to the sea \n\n(Catchpole, Frid et al. 2006). The proportion of consumed discard can vary, mainly \n\ndue to factors such as discard types, season of the year, area and the scavenging \n\nspecies (Allain, Biseau et al. 2013; Clark, Althaus et al. 2015). Depending on the \n\nspecies and their life-stage, the fisheries waste can be essential for their survival \n\nand if the discard rates decreases in the future, some species can be seriously \n\naffected and suffer high mortality (Garthe, Camphuysen et al. 1996). Benthic \n\nfishes and invertebrates can also take advantage from discards arriving to the sea, \n\nmaking a considerable contribution to the species energy demand and allowing \n\nthe existence of bigger populations (Catchpole, Frid et al. 2006).  \n\n In 1994 the annual landings reported to FAO were approximately 83 million \n\ntonnes (Alverson et al. 1994), and the amount discard by commercial fisheries was \n\nclose to one third of this value (Moranta, Massuti et al. 2000). However, in the \n\nfollowing decade (1994 to 2004) a decline on the discard rates in the main \n\nfisheries around the world was reported (Sanchez, Demestre et al. 2004). Since \n\n1994, the global fish production has been growing steadily reaching about 91 \n\nmillion tonnes in 2012 (FAO, 2014). When comparing regions and fishing gears, \n\nHall et al. (2000) estimated that the highest discard rates were found in the \n\nnorthwest Pacific Ocean, and the shrimp trawl fisheries were the gear that more \n\ncontributed to those rates, in terms of weight, with about 9 million tonnes, when \n\ncomparing with the global total fish discard provided by Alverson et al. (1994). \n\n\n\n 13 \n\n To ensure long-term sustainable environmental conditions, the Common \n\nFisheries Policy (CFP) recently created a conservation proposal to minimize the \n\nnegative impact of fishing activities in the European Union marine ecosystems, \n\ndecrease the unwanted catches and therefore to end the practice of discard, \n\nthrough the monitoring of the fleets data and the implementation of a discard ban \n\nin combination with catch quotas (European Commission, 2011). \n\n Although the impacts of bycatch and discards have been well studied for \n\nshallow coastal water ecosystems, much less information is available for deeper \n\nwaters (Kelleher, 2005).  \n\n \n\n 1.2. Deep-sea fisheries \n\n \n\n Deep-water fisheries usually take place between 200 \u2013 2000 m, on oceanic \n\nseamounts, continental slopes and oceanic ridge systems (FAO, 2009). Those \n\nfisheries started after Second World War, driven by major technological \n\nimprovements and by the need to seek for new and unexploited resources that \n\nwere previously out of range of traditional fishing methods (Koslow, Boehlert et al. \n\n2000). Watson and Morato (2013) estimated that since 1950, the mean depth of \n\nfishing worldwide has increased by 350 m (Figure 1).  \n\n Among all human-related activities known to impact the deep sea, resource \n\nexploitation is the most preoccupying and can have serious future consequences \n\nsuch as significant environmental impacts on fragile habitats such as deep-sea \n\ncoral beds and seamounts (Ramirez-Llodra, Tyler et al. 2011). It is only recently \n\nthat scientists have raised concerns on the sustainability of deep-sea fishing \n\nsuggesting dramatic consequences for deep-sea ecosystems (Benn, Weaver et al. \n\n2010). Fishing impacts on the deep sea can affect many habitats and species on \n\nseveral levels, being bottom trawling, because of its habitat-destructive \n\ncharacteristics, one of the major threats (Pham, Diogo et al. 2014). Low selectivity, \n\ndrifting and lost fishing gear can also greatly affect the whole ecosystem, as they \n\ncan continuously catch and trap fishes, marine mammals, invertebrates or \n\nseabirds for a long period of time (Davies, Roberts et al. 2007). \n\n\n\n 14 \n\n           \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Depth of world marine bottom fisheries catches, 1950\u20132004, with the trend line \n\n(solid line), fitted using a simple linear regression model and taking account both within \n\nand between species changes in mean depth. The dashed line shows the trend line from \n\nMorato et al. (2006a), accounting only for between-species effects. (Source: Watson and \n\nMorato, 2013) \n\n \n\n \n\n Although the concern for conservation and management is increasing, the \n\nknowledge on the deep-sea as an ecosystem is still in its infancy, and it is possible \n\nthat drastic changes happen in the future but remains undetected due to the \n\ndifficulty in assessing the full range of anthropogenic impacts in this vast and \n\nunderstudied ecosystem (Benn, Weaver et al. 2010). \n\n The deep-water fishing industry has been described as economically \n\nunsustainable and deep-sea fish a non-renewable resource (Glover and Smith, \n\n2003). It is expected that by 2025 all the existing deep-sea fisheries will be gravely \n\naffected, and by then new ones have been discovered, but they will not prevail \n\nmore than 20 to 30 years (Glover and Smith, 2003). On top of the increasing \n\nfishing pressure, the deep sea is mainly exposed to unregulated fisheries (Clarke, \n\nBorges et al. 2005).  \n\n   \n\n\n\n 15 \n\n1.3. Bycatch and discard in deep-sea fisheries \n\n \n\n Deep-sea fishing activities can destroy the seafloor, reducing the \n\ncomplexity of several habitats, destroying species refuges and disturbing \n\npopulation of deep-sea corals and sponges (Benn, Weaver et al. 2010; \n\nCOFREPECHE and SCAPECHE, 2014), but it can also increase the bycatch and \n\ndiscard rates not only of deep-sea species, but also fishes and invertebrates from \n\nmore superficial layers, and even sea birds (Norse, Brooke et al. 2012; Dur\u00e1n \n\nMu\u00f1oz, Murillo et al. 2010).  \n\n Bottom trawling has been known to be one of the most destroying types of \n\nfishing gears, being responsible for several fish stocks collapses in the world \n\n(Davies, Roberts et al. 2007; Clark, Althaus et al. 2015). Even though passive \n\ngears (e.g. longlines) have negative impacts on deep-sea coral reefs, these are \n\nmuch lower when compared with bottom trawling (Pham, Diogo et al. 2014). For \n\nexample, in the Alaskan waters, between 1990-2002, fishermen have landed near \n\n4182 tonnes of corals and sponges, and in the Orange roughy trawl fisheries, on \n\nthe South Tasman Rise seamounts, corals represented approximately 25% of the \n\nfisheries bycatch (Norse, Brooke et al. 2012; Lewison, Crowder et al. 2004). For \n\ndecades this problem has been neglected not only because of the ignorance of the \n\nexistence of this issue but also because along all of the existing management \n\npriorities, the deep sea was not included.  \n\n Along with those practices, Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) \n\ncatches have also been declared to be a serious problem, as a result of a lack of \n\neffective flag State control. These IUU values are the portion of the catch that is \n\nnot accounted for official statistics, contributing to the overexploitation and \n\ndepletion of fish stocks while destroys marine habitats (Pham et al. 2013). It has \n\nbeen reported that IUU captures can range between 11 and 26 million tonnes \n\nannually (FAO, 2009; Agnew, Pearce et al. 2009). \n\n  \n\n\n\n 16 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Sponges, gorgonids and molluscans discarded by trawlers.  \n\n(Source: The Rufford Small Grants Foundation; Available in: \n\nhttp://www.rufford.org/rsg/projects/raveendra_durgekar) \n\n \n\n1.4 Deep-sea sharks \n\n \n\nAccording to Compagno (1999), more than 60% of the described species of \n\nsharks are found in the deep sea, and almost 53% of them occur at depths greater \n\nthan 600 m. However, research on bycatch and discards of deep-sea sharks has \n\nreceived little attention. Depending on the species, their size, the season of the \n\nyear and their economic value, they can be either commercialized or discarded \n\n(Haedrich, Merrett et al. 2001; Coelho, Bentes et al. 2003). Many of the sharks are \n\nlanded already dead or with serious injuries due to the fishing equipment or the \n\nchanges of the temperature and pressure. The ones who are still alive can be \n\nreturned to the sea, even though the injuries will affect their survival (Allain, Biseau \n\net al. 2003; Coelho and Erzini, 2008). Other species, with high commercial value \n\nare commercialized especially for their livers that contain squalene and other \n\nelements with high value to the pharmaceutical market (Blackwell and Stevenson, \n\n2003; Akhilesh, Ganga et al. 2011; Wetherbee, 2000).  \n\n Between 1940-1970 direct shark fisheries increased significantly due to the \n\ndemand of the Vitamin A in their livers, but in the last years, a decreasing trend of \n\n\n\n 17 \n\nthe bycatch of deep-sea sharks has been noticed, along with the discard rates \n\n(Kyne and Simpfendorfer, 2007).  With the increasing concern about the impact of \n\nfishing on shark populations, organizations such as the International Union for \n\nConservation of Nature (IUCN) and FAO, have created groups towards the \n\nconservation and management of sharks (Stevens, Bonfil et al. 2000; Oliver, \n\nBraccini et al. 2015).  \n\n Using bathymetric categories, deep-sea sharks can be categorized into four \n\ndivisions: Paraprofundic (&lt;200 m), Mesoprofundic (200 - 600 m), Holoprofundic (? \n\n600 m) and Metaprofundic (greater than 600 m) (Martin and Treberg, 2002). For \n\nthe purposes of this project, we will consider deep-sea sharks as those whose \n\ndistribution is bellow 200 m and those with a life cycle characterized by high \n\nlongevity (> 25 years), low growth rates, low fecundity, long gestation period and \n\nlate maturity (Kyne and Simpfendorfer, 2007; Moura, Jones et al. 2014). Their life-\n\nhistory traits make these species highly vulnerable to overexploitation because \n\nthey cannot overcome high mortality rates: once the population starts to decline, \n\nrecovery will take decades or centuries (Ramos, Silva et al. 2013; ICES, 2013; \n\nGarc\u00eda, Lucifora et al. 2008; Ferretti, Worm et al. 2010). Deep-sea chondrichtyans \n\nare considered 1.6 - 1.9 times more vulnerable to extinction than continental shelf \n\nchondrichtyans, and 2.4 - 2.9 times more than oceanic ones (Garc\u00eda, Lucifora et \n\nal. 2008). \n\n It has been shown by several authors that even the slightest mortality rates \n\ncan quickly lead species with these life-history traits to overexploitation when \n\nexposed to multi-species fisheries (Barker and Schluessel, 2005;  Clarke, Borges \n\net al. 2005; Akhilesh, Ganga et al. 2011; Coelho and Erzini, 2008; Ferretti, Worm \n\net al. 2010; Garc\u00eda, Lucifora et al. 2008; Walker, 1998) or fisheries targeting shark \n\nresources world-wide (Walker, 1998). In collaboration with FAO, Castro (1999) \n\ndetermined that between 1989 and 1999, at least 26 shark species have severely \n\ndeclined and it is now known that other undocumented and unreported species \n\nfollowed the same pattern (Barker and Schluessel, 2005). Walker (1998) reported \n\nthat chondrichtyans landings can exceed 700000 tons/year and the International \n\nCouncil for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) revealed that since 1992, some \n\ncommercial fishing boats catch up to 40 tonnes of deep water sharks per week \n\n\n\n 18 \n\ndue to the increasing of their economic value and the high levels of bycatch (ICES, \n\n2013; Figueiredo, Bordalo-Machado et al. 2005).  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nFigure 3. Gulper shark (Centrophorus granulosus) landings in the deep sea shark fishery \n\nat Cochin. (Source: Akhilesh, Ganga et al. 2011) \n\n \n\n \n\n It is currently recognized that there is still a lack of information on the \n\nbiology of deep-sea sharks, including life history, feeding and migratory habitats, \n\nbut also on catch data (ICES, 2013). The major problems that compromise our \n\nknowledge of the status of deep-sea shark population, as well as other marine \n\nspecies, are the inaccurate identification of the lesser-known species, illegal, \n\nunreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing and lack of information on discarding \n\npractices for most deep-sea fisheries. Therefore, it is currently challenging to \n\nprovide a complete assessment on the fishing impacts on deep-water shark \n\npopulations (Coelho and Erzini, 2008; Blackwell and Stevenson, 2003; Martin and \n\nTreberg, 2002; Leit\u00e3o, Baptista et al. 2014). \n\n Deep-water rays have been also widely affected by the bycatch resultant \n\nfrom commercial fisheries once they have life history traits very similar to deep-\n\nwater sharks. The fishing pressure is showing to be a threat to these populations, \n\n\n\n 19 \n\nand since the majority of these species (except Raja clavata) have no commercial \n\nvalue, they are usually discarded. \n\n \n\n 1.5. Deep-sea elasmobranchs in the Azores \n\n \n\n The Azorean waters behold a high diversity of sharks and rays, constituting \n\na valuable natural heritage that must be preserved. Until the present time, 8 \n\norders, 21 families and 50 species of Elasmobranchs have been recorded in the \n\nAzores. The main deep-water shark and rays species captured in the Azores in \n\nterms of weight and numbers are: \n\n \n\n \n\n Kitefin shark, Dalatias licha: \n\nThe kitefin is a relatively small shark (maximum length of 186 cm), found \n\nmostly on the continental shelf and slope and occurring mainly between 50 m and \n\n1800 m depth (Bordalo-Machado, Pinho et al. 2002). It is characterized by not \n\nhaving spines in dorsal fins, a short and conical snout, and a greyish/dark-brown \n\nbody. Feeds mainly on deep-water bony fish. Targeted mainly for liver oil \n\nextraction. Its skin and meat is also used, especially for fish food production \n\n(Barreiros and Gadig, 2011 ; Fishbase). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.

It \n\nhas 2 dorsal spines and an elongated, almost cylindrical body, uniformly dark-grey \n\nor brown. Feeds on deep-water fish and cephalopods. It is commonly captured for \n\nhuman consumption: even though the fins and meat (mostly dried salted) have low \n\nvalue, the liver oil has a high commercial value (Barreiros and Gadig, 2011; \n\nFishbase). \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 5.

The body is \n\nusually dark-grey or brownish-grey. Feeds mainly on bony fishes, squid and \n\n\n\n 24 \n\ncrustaceans. It is marketed smoked and dried salted for human consumption and \n\nis also processed into fishmeal. It is a high source of squalene (Barreiros and \n\nGadig, 2011; Fishbase). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 12.

Objectives \n\n \n\nThe main objective of this work is to characterize the catch of the deep-\n\nwater sharks in the Azores, a region where deep-water fisheries have a high \n\neconomic and social importance, and at the same time harbours essential habitats \n\nfor these species. Analyses of data from the last four decades provide the first \n\naccount on deep-water shark bycatch in the Azores. \n\nA short account on the diversity and distribution of deep-sea sharks in \n\nAzorean waters is given to support the interpretation of catch data. Since very little \n\nis known about discard rates and bycatch consequences in this region, a special \n\nfocus is given to this subject, therefore, the potential impacts of these practices are \n\nacknowledged and discussed. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 27 \n\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  \n\n \n\n 2.1. Study Area \n\n \n\n The archipelago of the Azores is located in the northeast Atlantic (36 to \n\n40\u00baN, 24 to 32\u00baW) and is composed by 9 isolated volcanic islands distributed in 3 \n\ngroups: the oriental group (S\u00e3o Miguel and Santa Maria), the central group (Faial, \n\nS\u00e3o Jorge, Pico, Terceira and Graciosa) and the occidental group (Flores and \n\nCorvo). Those islands together with other small islets define the size of the Azores \n\nExclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) with almost 1 million km2, and an average depth \n\nof approximately 3000 m (Morato, 2012). The Azores EEZ holds a great variety of \n\ndeep-sea ecosystems and habitats, from seamounts to abyssal plains, island \n\nslopes and hydrothermal vents (Tempera, Pereira et al. 2012). The seafloor is \n\ntectonically active, irregular and rocky, therefore, the fishing grounds are highly \n\nlimited to the shallow water bordering the islands and close to the seamounts and \n\nsubmarine banks (Menezes, Sigler et al. 2006). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 16. Geographic location of the archipelago of Azores, with the red line \n\nrepresenting the EEZ limit. \n\n \n\n\n\n 28 \n\n 2.2. Description of the commercial fisheries  \n\n \n\n Fisheries in the Azores are multi-segmented, targeting multiple species \n\ninhabiting a wide range of habitats, and can be divided in four main categories: \n\ncoastal fleet targeting mainly small pelagic fishes with nets, pole-and-line targeting \n\ntunas, the pelagic longline fleet targeting primarily swordfish and the bottom \n\nlongline fleet targeting various demersal fishes.  \n\nThe small-scale fishery (using fishing boats smaller than 12 meters in \n\nlength) in spite of being considered inefficient when compared with the large-scale \n\nfishery, is responsible for almost 52% of the total catches in the region (Carvalho \n\nand Isidro, 2011). This fleet usually operate in shelf slopes and continental shelf \n\nbreaks, accessible to fishermen with small boats, and use mainly hand-operate \n\nnets, lift nets, purse seine or drop lines that are later collected by hand or with \n\nelectric or hydraulic reels, targeting small pelagic fishes like Trachurus picturatus \n\n(Blue jack mackrel), Scomber japonicus (mackerel) and Sardina pilchardus \n\n(sardine) and having annual landings of about 1.4 million tonnes per year (Pham, \n\nDiogo et al. 2014 ; Morato, 2012 ; Carvalho and Isidro, 2011).  \n\nThe pole-and-line fishery is responsible for the majority of the catch \n\noccurring within the Azores EEZ. Total catch of tuna fluctuates between 3500 and \n\n14000 tonnes per year (Pham et al. 2013). Pole-and line is considered to be \n\nselective practice, having limited levels of bycatch. This technique relies on two \n\nstages: 1) catching small pelagic fishes that will later be used as bait and 2) fishing \n\nfor the tuna. The fishing gear generally is a pole and a line, with a hook on it, and \n\nthe bait depends on the morphology and behaviour of the target species. The main \n\nspecies caught in those fisheries are Thunnus obesus (big eye tuna), Katsuwonus \n\npelamis (skipjack tuna) and to a lesser extent Thunnus alalunga (albacore), \n\nThunnus albacares (yellowfin tuna) and Thunnus thynnus (Atlantic bluefin tuna) \n\n(Morato, 2012). \n\nThe large pelagic vessels are also widely used in the Azores, they are in \n\naverage 18 m long, host different gear types and have a high catch capacity, using \n\nmore effective fishing techniques (Carvalho and Isidro, 2011; Ruttan, Gayanilo Jr. \n\net al. 2000). They are used to catch swordfish and to a lesser extent blue sharks. \n\n\n\n 29 \n\nThis fishing gear was first introduced in 1987, with official landings ranging \n\nbetween 25 to 450 tonnes per year (Pham et al. 2013). \n\nLastly, the fourth and second most important component of the Azorean \n\nfishing industry in terms of landed weight and value is the demersal fleet, which \n\nuses bottom longline and handline, since bottom trawling has been prohibited \n\n(EC1568/2005, 2005; Carvalho and Isidro, 2011). Total catches of this component \n\nranges between 3500 and 4500 tonnes per year. The bottom longline is a fishing \n\ngear that is comprised of a main line, with several branch lines attached and hooks \n\nplaced on the end of them. This device has many alternative buoys and weights \n\nplaced in constant intervals of the main line, and it can range from depths from \n\n800 to 1450 m (Figure 17) (Ramos, Silva et al. 2013; Morato, 2012). The same \n\nhappens with the handlines, but the main gear type consists in a line with several \n\nhooks attached. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 30 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 17 - Schematic representation of the bottom longline fishing method.

It \n\nis a selective fishing gear and it can range from depths between 1000 m to 1900 m \n\n(Besugo, 2013). It is comprised of a main line, connected with other secondary, \n\nvertical lines (free lines), with hooks placed on the lower end, and buoys on the \n\nupper end (Figure 18). The size of the gear, hooks and the material, depends \n\nmainly on the target species, but also on the vessels and the fishermen (Machete, \n\nMorato et al. 2011; Domingo, Forselledo et al. 2014). At present, official statistics \n\nsuggest catches are relatively low, ranging from 50 to 450 tonnes per year.     \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 31 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 18 - Schematic representation of the drifting bottom longline fishing method.

Both of the \n\ndata sets were compiled and estimated by Pham et al. (2013). The official data \n\nwere obtained from several landing databases recorded by regional and national \n\nauthorities from 1950 to 2014, but for this study only the last 4 decades (1974 to \n\n2014) were analysed. The data from 2010 to 2014 is derivative from unpublished \n\nwork. \n\nEstimation of IUU catch for the demersal fleet was based on data collected \n\nby fishery observers, according to a stratified random sampling scheme, based on \n\nfishing gear and the fleets by a Observer Programme for the Discards in Azorean \n\n\n\n 32 \n\nfisheries, PORPESCA (Pham et al. 2013). In the Azores, the IUU catches of the \n\ndemersal fleet consists primarily of bycatch and discards since very little illegal \n\nfishing activities currently exist. From the 24 elasmobranchs identified in the \n\ncatches, 17 were deep-water sharks. Catches were analysed in detail for the most \n\ncaught 9 species in terms of weight.   \n\n \n\n2.4 Fishing surveys data \n\n \n\nIn addition, and to complement this work, data from scientific fishing \n\nsurveys was used to further describe the deep-water shark diversity and \n\ndistribution in the Azores. \n\nThese surveys were carried out between 1996 and 2011, however no data \n\nis available for 1998 and 2006, and in 2009 only a few sets were performed. \n\nTherefore the data sets from these years were excluded from the analyses. In total \n\n481 longline sets were analysed. These were performed mainly around the nine \n\nislands and in the main seamounts and banks (Figure 19) using the R/V \n\n\u201cArquip\u00e9lago\u201d, with a mean depth of 525 m and a minimum and maximum depth of \n\n16 m and 2476 m, respectively. The bottom longline surveys followed a \n\nstandardized methodology designed to monitor Azorean demersal and deep-water \n\nfish species (Menezes, Sigler et al. 2006). \n\nDuring gear deployment, the start and end of each 50 m depth stratum was \n\nregistered. For all the depth intervals, we recorded the initial and final position of \n\nthe stratum, and the total fish catch (total weight and number of individuals), as \n\nwell as the effort associated (except for 2010). For the 9 most caught deep-water \n\nspecies the number of individuals landed was also registered. Since the fishing \n\nsets, locations, depth and effort, were not constant every year, the analysis of the \n\nvariation of the total weight per year would not be completely accurate (Table 1). \n\nCatch per unit effort (CPUE), in this case the number of individuals caught by 1000 \n\nhooks, where the fishing effort was distributed through the years, mainly from \n\nMarch to November, was also computed.  \n\nA Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to investigate annual differences in the \n\nmean weight of the captured species; the null hypothesis was that the species \n\n\n\n 33 \n\nmean weight was not significantly different through the years. This test was \n\ncombined to the Bonferroni\u2013Dunn test to allow multiple comparisons. Dunn's test \n\nis a not parametric analog where we can highlight where are the significant \n\ndifferences using multiple, stepdown comparisons. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 19 - Representation of the sets performed (red lines) in the Azores between 1996 \n\nand 2011. \n\n \n \n\nData organization and assemblage as well as statistical analyses to \n\nrepresent the average CPUE per year, the depth ranges and the species mean \n\nweight through the years were performed using Microsoft Office Excel (Microsoft \n\nOffice \u00a9 2007). This software and SigmaPlot (version 11.0) were used to create all \n\ngraphs. The program ArcMap 10.0 \u00a9 ESRI was used for the construction of the \n\nmaps and the visual representation of the sets performed on the experimental \n\nsurveys. The Kruskal-Wallis and Bonferroni\u2013Dunn tests were performed on the \n\nsoftware GrapPad Prism 6 \u00a9 2015. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 34 \n\nYears N\u00ba of Sets Total Weight (kg)\n\n1996 24 201,29\n\n1997 28 190,90\n\n1999 46 276,48\n\n2000 31 447,09\n\n2001 32 414,50\n\n2002 32 728,01\n\n2003 37 721,56\n\n2004 44 987,12\n\n2005 37 864,45\n\n2007 32 1740,23\n\n2008 38 778,852\n\n2009 7 123,34\n\n2010 50 1277,74\n\n2011 50 579,24\n \n\n \n\nTable 1 - Number of sets performed each year, and the corresponding total weight of \n\ndeep-sea sharks. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 35 \n\n \n\n3.

The total weight of the reported catches, \n\napproximately 13428 tonnes, greatly exceeded that of IUU ones (~ 8400 tonnes). \n\nHowever, this value (13428 tonnes) is almost completely due to the catch of only \n\ntwo species, Dalatias licha and Raja clavata.  \n\nDalatias licha represents almost 53% of the total catches and about 98% of \n\nthe sharks reported values. The second deep-water shark with the highest reported \n\ncatch is Centrophorus lusitanicus, even though it is known that this species does \n\nnot dwell in Azorean waters (Correia, 2009) suggesting that other species were \n\nlanded and identified as Centrophorus lusitanicus, as its fishing is allowed. \n\nThe IUU catches are mainly represented by seven different species, the \n\nmost caught being Centrophorus squamosus, which contributes to almost 40% of \n\nthe deep-water sharks IUU catches.  \n\nRegarding rays, Raja clavata shows the highest values both on the official \n\nand IUU catches, while other species have only been recorded in IUU data.  \n\nIt is worth noting that from the 23 species of elasmobranchs, only 11 of them \n\nare landed, while 20 are usually discarded. \n\n\n\n 36 \n\nTable 2.

The increase in deep-water sharks caught from \n\nthe late seventies until the early 1990\u00b4s can be mainly attributed to the Dalatias \n\nlicha direct fishery.

From 1988, the values slowly decline, with a \n\nfew irregular high peaks, but from 2011 to 2014 they raise again in all the six \n\nspecies, even though with different landing weights. Etmopterus pusillus and \n\nCentrophorus squamosus are the only species that have never been officially \n\nlanded. The other four species have been reported but the captures never \n\nsurpassed 6 tonnes per year.  \n\nThe deep-water shark Hexanchus griseus also shows a similar trend to \n\nthese six species, but with the exception that it started being caught in 1974. In \n\naddition, there was an unusual peak of reported catches in 1981. \n\nDalatias licha is the only species with more reported landings than \n\nunreported catches. From 1987 to 1992 the capture values tend to increase, and \n\nfrom there they start to slowly decrease. A marked difference was observed \n\nbetween the years 1996 and 1997 when the values dropped dramatically.  From \n\n1997, the decrease is gradual until 2011, the last year with reported catches.  \n\nConcerning the IUU, from 1974 to 1997 the values were relatively low but show a \n\nsteady increase. From there, the IUU catches were fairly stable, even though they \n\ngradually decreased. \n\nFinally, Centrophorus lusitanicus is the only species with only reported \n\ncatches and those only began in 2007 and continued until 2013. Those values \n\nstarted below 1 tonne and increased to almost 70 tonnes in 2013. \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 42 \n\n3.2. Fishing Surveys \n\n  \n\nThe fishing surveys performed in the Azores between 1996 and 2011 \n\nresulted in the identification of 28 deep-water elasmobranchs, including 20 sharks \n\nof 8 different families (Table 3) that accounted for 66 % (9.2 tonnes) of the total \n\nweight of elasmobranchs captured. The top 3 species captured in terms of weight \n\nwere Deania profundorum, Deania calcea and Dalatias licha, but in terms of \n\nnumber of individuals were Etmopterus spinax, Deania profundorum and Deania \n\ncalcea. \n\nThese species were captured at a mean depth ranging from 208 m to 1085 \n\nm. The widest depth ranges were observed in Etmopterus spinax (from 112 m to \n\n1200 m), Etmopterus pusillus (from 112 m to 1195 m) and Deania calcea (from \n\n335 m to 1296 m). Species caught in the greater mean depth were \n\nCentroscymnus coelolepis (1085 m), Etmopterus princeps (1064 m) and \n\nCentroscymnus crepidater (1049 m).  Some of the species with a shallower mean \n\ndepth were also the ones with the lower number of individuals caught \n\n(Heptranchias perlo, Charcarias taurus and Hexanchus griseus). \n\nThe capture depth range of the nine most frequent deep-water sharks is \n\nrepresented in Figure 24. The relatively small boxplots of the species Etmopterus \n\nspinax, Dalatias licha, Deania profundorum and Centroscymnus crepidater \n\nindicate a high level of aggregation between their respective depths. The boxplot \n\nof the species Etmopterus pusillus and Centroscymnus cryptacanthus are \n\ncomparatively taller, showing that they have a higher depth range and are more \n\ndisperse. There are 3 distinctive groups where 50% of the individuals form \n\naggregations at similar depth ranges: Etmopterus spinax and Dalatias licha form \n\naggregations at about 600 m, Etmopterus pusillus and Deania profundorum form \n\naggregations at 700 m, and the remaining species (Censtroscymnus \n\ncryptacanthus, Centrophorus squamosus, Deania calcea, Centroscymnus \n\ncrepidater and Centroscymnus coelepis) assemble between 1000 m and 1100 m. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 43 \n\n \n\nTable 3.

The same happens with Etmopterus pusillus, with 40% of the \n\nindividuals ranging between 700 m and 1000 m.  \n\n\n\n 45 \n\nRegarding the deep-water rays, they represented about 34% of the \n\nelasmobranchs catches, with the species Raja clavata contributing for 78% of \n\nthose values. \n\n Ten species of deep-water sharks were caught in relatively low numbers, \n\nand therefore it can be assumed that those species are not very common in \n\nAzorean waters and/or do not have a similar distribution to the other species. \n\nInterestingly, the species with the greatest importance to commercial fisheries, \n\nCentrophorus squamosus and Centroscymnus coelolepis, commonly called as \n\n\"siki\", were not captured in large numbers. Of these two species, only 138 \n\nindividuals were caught, representing only 10% of the deep-water shark fishery in \n\nterms of weight (0.93 tonnes). \n\nAnalyses of catch per unit effort (CPUE) (Figure 25) show that the species \n\nwith higher CPUE were Etmopterus spinax (5 \u00b1 2 individuals per 1000 hooks), \n\nDeania profundorum (4 \u00b1 1 individuals per 1000 hooks) and Deania calcea (2.2 \u00b1 \n\n0.25 individuals per 1000 hooks). Deania calcea presented an increasing trend in \n\nthe average CPUE from 1999 to 2004. From there, the values dropped and remain \n\nlower. The same did not happen with Deania profundorum and Etmopterus spinax \n\nthat show irregular high and low CPUE within the study period, with the exception \n\nthat Etmopterus spinax shows a decrease from 2003 to 2011.  \n\nThe CPUE of Etmopterus pusillus showed 3 increasing periods: between \n\n1999 and 2001, 2003 to 2005, and then from 2007 to 2011, reaching the higher \n\nvalue in 2001 with an average of 1.4 (\u00b1 0.4) individuals per 1000 hooks, but each \n\nof those increase periods are less accentuated than the other. The CPUE for both \n\nCentroscymnus crepidater and Centroscymnus cryptacanthus showed high inter-\n\nannual variability, increasing and decreasing every other year, but Centroscymnus \n\ncrepidater presented generally higher values and a stabilization of the values \n\nbetween 2004 and 2008. \n\n Centrophorus squamosus presented the lower CPUE, showing the highest \n\naverage CPUE of 0.11 (\u00b1 0.05) individuals per 1000 hooks in 2002. CPUE for \n\nCentroscymnus coelolepis was 0 during 5 years, and presented relatively low \n\nvalues, but with large error bars in the remaining years. In 2011 it reached its \n\n\n\n 46 \n\nhighest CPUE, when normally the other species presented one of their lower catch \n\nrates. \n\nCPUE of Dalatias licha showed two visible trends: an increase from the \n\nbeginning of the study to 2005 (except from 2000 to 2001), and a decrease from \n\nthen onwards, having a value near to 0 in 2011. \n\nFor almost all the species, the first two years present the lower average \n\nCPUE values.  \n\nFigure 26 shows the mean weight variation of the 9 most captured species \n\nthrough the years. Statistical analysis (Kruskal-wallis test) showed that there were \n\nno significant annual differences in the mean weights of the species Dalatias licha \n\n(P=0.7661), Centroscymnus cryptacanthus (P=0.4093) and Centroscymnus \n\ncrepidater (P=0.0664). However, in the species Centrophorus squamosus \n\n(P=0.0353), Deania calcea (P=<0,0001), Centroscymnus coelolepis (P=0.0217), \n\nDeania profundorum (P=<0,0001), Etmopterus pusillus (P=<0,0001) and \n\nEtmopterus spinax (P=<0,0001) significant annual differences were detected. \n\nResults of a Dunn\u2019s test show the years with significant differences (Table 4).   \n\n  \n\n. \n\n\n\n 47 \n\n \n\nFigure 25.

DISCUSSION \n\n \n\nTotal catch estimates in the Azores suggest that 203 different species have \n\nbeen landed between 1974 and 2014 (ICES, 2013). These include a wide variety \n\nof groups, such as algae, cephalopods, fishes, marine mammals and crustaceans, \n\nhaving a total weight of about 272294 tonnes. The reported landings of the \n\nidentified species have a total weight of about 213883 tonnes, while the IUU catch \n\nhave a total weight of 58411 tonnes. When analysing our group of interest, the \n\ndeep-sea elasmobranchs - 17 species of deep-sea sharks and 6 species of deep-\n\nsea rays - they contribute to 6.28% of reported catches, and 14.38% of the IUU \n\ncatch, concluding that this group suffers a great pressure from the IUU fishing. \n\nAs shown in Table 2, reported catches (13428 tonnes) are higher than IUU \n\ncatches (~ 8400 tonnes). It is important to note that catches of the kitefin shark, \n\nDalatias licha, comprise about 79% of this amount, which can be explained by the \n\nfact that the direct fisheries of this species were permitted until the middle of \n\n1990s.  \n\nThe small catch values (both official and IUU) observed between 1997 and \n\n2014 (Figure 20) reflect the implementation of fishing regulations including Total \n\nAllowable Catches (TACs) that limit the amount of fishes that can be caught, over \n\na given period of time, in a specific stock. Therefore, from the 23 species of \n\nelasmobranchs caught, only 11 were officially landed, with relatively low values, \n\nwhilst 20 have IUU values, indicating that they are mostly discarded. \n\nTACs are set annually, based on the ICES scientific advice (ICES, 2013).  \n\nFor example, TACs for deep-water shark species in the EU were set to 0 in 2010, \n\nand since then, reported values were relatively low ranging from about 70 tonnes \n\nin 2013 to about 0.2 tonnes in 2014. Those catches (70 tonnes) are mostly \n\ncomposed of Centrophorus lusitanicus a species that doesn\u2019t dwell in Azorean \n\nwaters and that is not subject to the TACs regulations. Therefore, the report of \n\nCentrophorus lusitanicus landings must result from misidentification problems. \n\nRamos et al., (2013) reported that in 2010, 93% of Centrophorus squamosus \n\nindividuals were marked as Centrophorus lusitanicus.  \n\n\n\n 51 \n\nFor other species (Centrophorus granulosus, Centroscymnus crepidater, \n\nCentroscymnus cryptacanthus, Dalatias licha, Deania calcea, Deania \n\nprofundorum, Heptranchias perlo and Hexanchus griseus), the reported values \n\nsince 2010 never surpassed 2.7 tonnes per year. This value (2.7 tonnes) is mainly \n\nderivative from the catches of Deania calcea in 2010, the last year with reported \n\nlandings; the landing values of the other species barely surpass one tonne per \n\nyear.  Due to the implementation of the TACs, the IUU values tend to raise every \n\nyear and it is believed that the discard rates in mixed deep-water fisheries has \n\nsignificantly increased. The values derived from the period 2010 to 2014 are \n\nsimilar to those observed from 2001 forward, and this can be explained with the \n\nimplementation of quotas for the deep-water species. As a result, it is believed that \n\nsome vessels may have logged some deep-water sharks as other species. \n\nCentrophorus squamosus was the species with the highest IUU value, contributing \n\nwith almost 40% of the deep-water shark IUU catches. It has been previously \n\nreported (Machete and Santos, 2007) that this species represents a large share in \n\nthe bycatch resultant of the black scabbard fish fisheries in the Azores, along with \n\ntwo other shark species: Etmopterus spinax and Centroscymnus cryptacanthus. \n\nAlthough Etmopterus spinax represents about 7% of the IUU catches, \n\nCentroscymnus cryptacanthus does not contribute to a significant share of the \n\nlandings, both reported and IUU. \n\nThe fisheries of the kitefin shark, Dalatias licha, in the Azores began around \n\nthe 1970s resulting in high official catches until the end of the 1990s, when it \n\nstopped in result of low profit margins. Catch values changed every other year, \n\ndue to the fluctuation of the market, having high peaks in 1981 and 1991. Since \n\n2000, the reported values dramatically decreased, ranging from 35 tonnes in 2002 \n\nto about one tonne in 2011, the last year with reported values. This species has \n\nalways been present as bycatch in other fisheries, and since 2010 the IUU values \n\nremained relatively stable at a mean of approximately 27 tonnes per year, mainly \n\nto management restrictions.  \n\nThe remaining species have low reported landings, due to the \n\nimplementations of TACs as it was mentioned before. In 2010, TACs were \n\nreduced to 0 with an allowance for bycatch of 10% of 2009 TACs, and by 2011 it \n\n\n\n 52 \n\nwas reduced to 3%. By 2012, no allowance for bycatch was authorized (ICES, \n\n2013). Consequently, the IUU values tend to rise as a result of the restricted \n\nquotas implemented, and other measures such as minimum mesh sizes, minimum \n\nsizes and weights, bans of specific gear types (EC1568/2005, 2005), along with \n\nthe bycatch of the mixed fisheries, especially since 1984 with the introduction of \n\nthe bottom longline in the Azorean fisheries.  \n\nThe deep-water rays are also included in the EU TACs for \u201cSkates and \n\nRays Rajidae\u201d, given that some of these species have high commercial value, \n\nespecially Raja clavata.   \n\n Within the shark species landed, the IUCN red list assessments classifies \n\nas:  \n\n? Data deficient: Etmopterus princeps; Scymnodon obscurus. \n\n? Least Concern: Deania profundorum; Etmopterus spinax; Deania \n\ncalcea; Etmopterus pusillus; Centroscymnus crepidater; \n\nCentroscymnus cryptacanthus; Pseudotriakis microdon. \n\n? Near Threatened: Dalatias licha; Hexanchus griseus; Somniosus \n\nmicrocephalus; Heptranchias perlo; Centroscymnus coelolepis. \n\n? Vulnerable: Centrophorus squamosus; Centrophorus granulosus; \n\nCentrophorus lusitanicus. \n\n \n\nCentrophorus squamosus and Centrophorus granulosus, classified as \n\nvulnerable (high risk of endangerment in the wild), are two of the three species \n\nwith the highest landings, especially regarding IUU values, which gives them a \n\nvery uncertain and worrying future. The near threatened species (likely to become \n\nendangered in the near future), mainly Dalatias licha and Hexanchus griseus, \n\nshould also become a priority in the fisheries management. \n\nWhen it comes to the proportion of deep water sharks (%DWS) captured in \n\nrelation to other species by bottom fishing methods (Figure 21), since 1997 the \n\nvalues tend to stay stable at a mean of 4.5%, but it\u2019s still a high value to ensure \n\nthe sustainability of long-term fisheries, and the survival of these species, \n\nespecially the ones referred as vulnerable and near threatened.   \n\n\n\n 53 \n\nWith the implementation of the quotas, the IUU catches tend to rise (Figure \n\n22). The low values of IUU landings between 1977 and 1995 can be explained by \n\nthe low commercial value of some species, and the permission of the direct \n\nfisheries in some species, especially Dalatias licha. After that, the IUU values \n\nincreased every other year, reaching almost 100%. The results herein presented \n\ntogether with those reported by Pham et al. (2013) clearly demonstrate that with \n\nthe implementations of TACs, the discard rates greatly increased without \n\ndecreasing the catch levels.  \n\n In the fisheries surveys performed in the Azores between 1996 and 2011, \n\n34 species of elasmobranchs were captured. The deep-water sharks accounted \n\nfor about 50% of the total weight. Deania calcea, Deania profundorum and \n\nDalatias licha were the top 3 species captured in terms of weight, but when it \n\ncomes to numbers, Etmopterus spinax replaced Dalatias licha in the top. From \n\nthese species, Dalatias licha was the only one that entered the top 3 of the official \n\nlandings. \n\nRegarding the capture depth ranges (Figure 24), it is important to refer that \n\nthe recorded depths belong to the depth stratum where the fishery occurs, not \n\ncorresponding to the actual structure of deep-sea shark populations analyzed. \n\nHowever, the survey results were consistent with those published for all studied \n\nspecies except Etmopterus pusillus and Centroscymnus cryptacanthus that have \n\nbeen captured at greater depths than previously reported (presented in the \n\nIntroduction). \n\nThe species belonging to the family Etmopteridae (Etmopterus spinax and \n\nEtmopterus pusillus), are among the ones with the highest number of individuals \n\ncaught, but they are also the ones that dwell at the lower depths, suggesting that \n\nspecies that inhabit in lower depths are more susceptible to the fishing gears \n\ntargeting demersal and deep-water species, and therefore more vulnerable. \n\nDalatias licha is also mostly caught at similar depths, but was not as abundant \n\ncompared to other species. Deania calcea, Centroscymnus crepidater and \n\nCentroscymnus coelolepis were caught at deeper waters than the other species, \n\nbut Centroscymnus crepidater and Centroscymnus coelolepis have lower landing \n\nnumbers when compared with Deania calcea, which could be explained by their \n\n\n\n 54 \n\ndepth range. Centroscymnus crepidater and Centroscymnus coelolepis form \n\naggregates at higher depths and are not as dispersed in shallower depths as \n\nDeania calcea, being therefore less susceptible to the fishing gears. The \n\noccurrence of Centroscymnus coelolepis in these type of fisheries can be \n\nexplained by its primarily scavenging behaviour (Menezes et al. 2009). Some \n\nauthors have also suggested that Centroscymnus coelolepis may be less \n\nvulnerable to over fishing given their widespread depth distribution. The same may \n\nhappen with Centroscymnus cryptacanthus that although it has a large depth \n\nrange, 50% of the individuals assemble at about 1100 m, explaining their low \n\ncaptures in numbers. These depth aggregates can be a result of various \n\nconditions, including sex, maturity stage, size, different prey preferences and even \n\navoidance of feeding competition with larger specimens (Clarke et al. 2001; \n\nRamos, Silva et al. 2013).   \n\n The analyses of the average CPUE of the top 9 deep-water shark species \n\n(Figure 25) showed that the species with higher CPUE were Etmopterus spinax, \n\nDeania profundorum and Deania calcea. CPUE values for Deania calcea showed \n\nan increasing trend from 1999 to 2004, which demonstrate a high fishing pressure \n\nleading to a presumed decreased of the population size, with a decrease in the \n\naverage CPUE in the following years. Deania profundorum showed low CPUE in \n\nthe first years, and a large increase in 2002. Since then, the values showed great \n\nvariations, which could indicate fluctuations in the population size every other year. \n\nThe species with the higher CPUE average, Etmopterus spinax, showed high \n\ncaptures up until 2003, even though those values present fluctuations. From 2003 \n\nuntil the end of the study the values tended to decrease, suggesting that this \n\nspecies abundance have been previously disturbed and exposed to possible \n\noverexploitation. Etmopterus pusillus showed three increasing periods, which \n\nmeans that there were two periods where the species abundance declined: \n\nbetween 2002 and 2004, and 2005 to 2007. Since there is no available data for \n\n2006, it is not possible to conclude what happened during that period. Although \n\nCentroscymnus crepidater CPUE values had 3 high peaks (2000, 2002 and 2003), \n\nthe rest of the years appear to be relatively stable, with low fluctuations every \n\nother year, with a visible stabilization between 2004 and 2008, which could mean \n\n\n\n 55 \n\nsustainable harvesting of this species. Centroscymnus cryptacanthus also showed \n\nvariations in the average CPUE, having 4 years with 0 CPUE, which suggests that \n\nthis species is more rarely caught than the others. The species Centrophorus \n\nsquamosus and Centroscymnus coelolepis, also presented fluctuations in the \n\naverage CPUE, but Centroscymnus coelolepis showed 5 years with 0 CPUE \n\nwhich may mean that this species has a different distribution then the others or its \n\npopulation has decreased. Finally, Dalatias licha showed an increase in the \n\naverage CPUE up until 2005, and then a decrease, until the end of the study. \n\nSince it was a very popular species until the end of the 1990s, it is possible that \n\nthis decrease is related with the prohibition of its direct fishery.  \n\n Generally, the CPUE analysis always shows increasing and decreasing \n\ntrends that accompany the declines and recovery of populations. This monitoring \n\nshould be maintained in the future to ensure suitable management of the \n\nresources. \n\nThere is not enough information avalailable regarding deep-sea sharks and \n\ntheir biology, specially regarding their mean weight. Therefore, the mean weight \n\nper year analyses performed in this study have almost no data for comparison. \n\nThe only species with information available are Dalatias licha, with a mean weight \n\nof 8 kg (eol.org), Etmopterus spinax, with a maximum published weight of 850 g \n\n(Fishbase), Centroscymnus coelolepis, with a mean weight of 20 kg (Parker and \n\nFrancis, 2012) and Deania calcea with a recorded mean weigh of 2.61 kg (Clarke, \n\n2000). \n\n Although the mean weight per year of the 9 most caught species does not \n\nseem to present high variations with time, the results of a Kruskal-Wallis test \n\nshowed that only three species (Centroscymnus cryptacanthus, Dalatias licha and \n\nCentroscymnus crepidater) do not present significant differences in their mean \n\nweight though the years which could mean that they are less influenced by fishing \n\npractices, maintaining their mean weight stable over the years. Based on a \n\nrelationship between the average CPUE and mean weight we suggest that in \n\nsome cases, when values are varying in opposite directions (for example, the \n\ndecrease of the CPUE values and increase of the mean weight), they are \n\ncorrelated. The mean weight of Dalatias licha obtained in this study was similar to \n\n\n\n 56 \n\nthe one reported in the literature (8 kg; eol.org). This may suggest that fishing has \n\nnot reduced the species average size. Their mean individual size can be related \n\nwith their average CPUE: when the mean CPUE start to decline (mainly in 2007 \n\nand 2008), this species recovers, having a higher mean weight in those years. \n\nTherefore we can conclude that the decreasing CPUE in the last years is not \n\nrelated to a decreasing abundance of the population but a decrease in the \n\ncatches. Regarding the other 2 species (Centroscymnus cryptacanthus and \n\nCentroscymnus crepidater), and relating the mean weight values with the average \n\nCPUE, it can be observed that Centroscymnus cryptacanthus shows an increase \n\nin the mean weight when the average CPUE stabilized, between 2003 and 2004. \n\nIn the case of Centroscymnus crepidater, the years with the lowest mean weight \n\n(2003 and 2004) may result from the high peaks of CPUE from 2002 and 2003. \n\nHowever, these differences were not significant.   \n\nSignificant differences were detected for the remaining species. In \n\nCentrophorus squamosus, the only years with significant differences detected \n\nwere 2007 and 2010, were the species suffer a difference of nearly 5 kg in the \n\nmean weight. Deania calcea showed several years with significant differences, as \n\nwell as Deania profundorum, Etmopterus pusillus and Etmopterus spinax. In \n\nEtmopterus pusillus, 2002 was the year with the most significant differences, when \n\ncompared with the other years, and in Deania profundorum, 2002 and 2005. \n\nFinally, for Etmopterus spinax, 1999 and 2001 were the years with the higher \n\nsignificant differences, recording two of the years with the lowest mean recorded \n\nweight. The weight differences in Centroscymnus coelolepis are particularly \n\nevident between 2004 and 2011. \n\n Centrophorus squamosus showed one of the higher mean weights in 2007, \n\nwere the CPUE is close to 0. From 2003 to 2007 it presented an increase in the \n\nmean weight and low CPUE values, suggesting that the species were recovering \n\nfrom the higher landings in the past years. \n\nIn Deania calcea, the mean weight tend to fluctuate between the different \n\nyears and in 2007 it presented the highest mean weight, also corresponding to \n\none of the lowest CPUE values, showing a recovery. The mean weight reported in \n\nthe northeast Atlantic (2.61 kg; Clarke, 2000), match the ones registered by these \n\n\n\n 57 \n\nexperimental surveys, so we can conclude that this species can more easily \n\nrecover from the fishing pressure when compared to other species.  \n\n The mean weight of Centroscymnus coelolepis drastically decreases with \n\nthe increase of the CPUE, meaning that this species is very vulnerable to fishing. It \n\nis also important to refer that this species is not caught in the surveys every year, \n\nand when it is, the mean weight never surpass the 8 kg. When compared to the \n\nmean weight reported by Parker and Francis (2012) of 20 kg, it could mean that \n\nCentroscymnus coelolepis landings are mainly composed by juveniles and that \n\nthey are more vulnerable to fishing than adults, or they have different distributions. \n\nIt has been reported that this species have preferential distribution of young \n\nspecimens at greater depths and of pregnant females in the upper strata (Clarke, \n\n2000). To complement the current study, an evaluation of the size and maturity \n\nstage of the caught individuals would be very important. The constant low weight \n\nof Centroscymnus coelolepis may also explain the decrease in \u201csiki\u201d landings: this \n\nspecies was very popular in the past commercial fisheries, but since the \n\npopulations started to decline and being severely affected, it has become much \n\nless common in present commercial fisheries.  \n\nDeania profundorum showed one of the higher mean weights in the \n\nbeginning of the study up until 2001, where the CPUE values were close to 0 and \n\nthis species was rarely caught. Since then, the mean weight has been slowly \n\ndecreasing, and in 2005 shows the lowest mean weight. In 2004 high CPUE \n\nvalues were recorded, suggesting that the species suffered from high fishing \n\npressure that year and remained affected until the next year, demonstrating their \n\nlow capability of recovery.  \n\nEtmopterus pusillus showed weight fluctuations throughout the years that \n\ncannot be entirely correlated to the CPUE values, which could mean that this \n\nspecies is not being greatly affected by fishing practices.  \n\nStatistical analyses showed that Etmopterus spinax weight was lowest in \n\n1999 and 2001 when compared to other years. The low value registered in 2001 \n\ncan be correlated with the high CPUE value, affecting the species up to 2008, \n\nwhen the mean weight increased and the average CPUE decreased. Etmopterus \n\nspinax has been described as having a mean weight of 0,85 kg (Fishbase), which \n\n\n\n 58 \n\nis a lot higher that the weight registered in the fishing surveys. Assuming that the \n\nindividuals caught are mainly juvenils and that this species can not easily recover \n\nwhen target of fishing practices, it is possible to define Etmopterus spinax is \n\nparticularly susceptible to overexploitation. Both Etmopterus spinax and Deania \n\ncalcea have one of the greatest average CPUE values, and both of them show \n\ndecreasing patterns from 2004 until the end of the study, suggesting that both \n\nthese species are the ones that are most affected and vulnerable to \n\noverexploitation, especially Etmopterus spinax, since, as referred before, the \n\nlanded individuals may all be juveniles. \n\n The combination of the results of the landing, IUU and survey data show \n\nthat some species may be more vulnerable to fishing practices than others, and \n\nthan those take more time to recover. If these particular species continue to be \n\naffected by fishing, they can easily be lead to extinction, especially the ones \n\nalready registered as Near Threatned or Vulnerable by the IUCN. \n\nThis study shows an increasing trend of the IUU catches. Although it has \n\nbeen reported that bycatch rates have been slowly declining all over the world, this \n\ndecrease may have been a result from the decline of the global catch rate, \n\nindicating a decrease of the total availability of fish, rather than a more \n\ncauticioness managament of the unselective fishing practices and gears (Zeller \n\nand Pauly, 2005). The same maybe happening with deep-sea sharks: results \n\nshow a declining in the landings, but are the fisheries being adapted to these \n\nspecies or have the population sizes decreased over time? \n\n It is well known that even small changes in species populations can change \n\nthe whole ecosystem. At species level, a high fishing pressure can result in \n\nchanges in species abundance and population size, but when taken in account the \n\nconsequences at a higher level, it can affect trophic interactions and the whole \n\ncommunity function (Stevens, Bonfil et al. 2000). Concerning deep-sea sharks, \n\nattention needs to be focused on these poorly studied species, particularly in the \n\ncontext of the entire ecosystem for a better understanding of the consequences of \n\npopulation changes in the trophic interactions, and to be able to avoid negative \n\nimpacts in the future. \n\n \n\n\n\n 59 \n\n5. CONCLUSION \n\n \n\n As already pointed out in this study, there is a large lack of information \n\nregarding deep-sea species, in particular, deep-water sharks. Herein we identify a \n\nneed for more accurate taxonomic identification and collection of data regarding \n\nthe species landed, as well as a more descriptive study of those species, \n\nespecially the ones that are less-known. It is important to understand species \n\nbiological traits, such as growth for further comparison with future works in the \n\nsame field and update of fishing statistics. Also, a better knowledge of their \n\nreprodutive ecology, as well as behaviour, such as spatial movement patterns and \n\nlocations of parturition is of great importance, and would be a major improvement,  \n\nto prevent high rates of bycath in sensitive areas (Parker and Francis, 2012).  \n\nThere is also a clear need to better quantify bycatch and discard practices through \n\nthe implementation of observer programs. \n\nThe study of deep-sea sharks fisheries, bycatch and discard is still in its \n\ninfancy and is particularly challenging since there are many problems that can be \n\nmasked and difficult to control. Fisheries management and long term sustainability \n\nare of utmost importance and  therefore, research to understand the effects and \n\nconsequences of bycatch is essential. The establishment of precautionary quotas \n\nand size limits to avoid overfishing should be considerate a priority. Further, other \n\nproblems such as the waste derivative from finning practices as finning should be \n\ntaken in consideration in the near future: it is recommended that once the species \n\nare landed the carcass should have full utilization (Kjerstad, Fossen et al. 2003).  \n\nFinally, one of the top priorities should be the research of effective practices \n\nsuch as fishing gears modifications and balanced harvesting methods that can \n\ndecrease the high rates of deep-sea species bycatch, and promote an effective \n\nsystem of control, enforcement and inspection, including the fighting against IUU \n\nfishing activities, while encouraging the sustainability of long-term fisheries \n\n(Musick, Burgess et al. 2000). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 60 \n\n6.
