Atlantirivulus riograndensis (Costa &amp; Lan\u00e9s, 2009) is a fish registered to the basin of Patos lagoon and the adjacent coastal plains in \nsouthern states of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina, Brazil, found in shallow water courses with that have large quantities of aquatic vegetation \nand forest edges. The objective of this study was to investigate the reproductive strategy and tactics of this species including the sex ratio, the length \nat first maturity, spawning type, fecundity and the possible associations among reproduction and abiotic factors. Sampling of specimens occurred in \nperennial wetlands within the Banhado dos Pachecos wildlife refuge, in the city of Viam\u00e3o, state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, which is a conservation \nunit that belongs to an area of environmental protection in the Pampa Biome. The capture of 30 A. riograndensis specimens per month occurred from \nJanuary to December of 2012. A total of 188 females and 172 males were captured and the total sex ratio was 1:1 in the sampled population. Sexual \nmaturity of the species occurs after 13.59 and 11.92 mm (SL) for females and males, respectively. Both a multiple spawning and a long reproductive \nperiod (since August to March) were confirmed by the presence of post-ovulatory follicles that were observed through histological analysis and \nthe values of the gonadosomatic index in females considered spawning capable. The average absolute fecundity of the species is of 19.33 (\u00b1 6.18) \nvitellogenic oocytes in mature ovaries. No significant relationship was found between mean GSI and the abiotic data. Reproductive tactics presented \nby A. riograndensis indicate a species with an opportunistic reproductive strategy, following the pattern of other species of the Rivulidae family.\n\nKEYWORDS. Atlantirivulus riograndensis, gonadal development, multiple spawning, fecundity.\n\nRESUMO. Estrat\u00e9gia reprodutiva de um rivul\u00eddeo n\u00e3o anual em um banhado perene.

A captura de trinta indiv\u00edduos de A. riograndensis por m\u00eas, \nocorreu de janeiro a dezembro de 2012. Foram amostradas 188 f\u00eameas e 172 machos e a propor\u00e7\u00e3o sexual total foi de 1:1 na popula\u00e7\u00e3o amostrada. A \nmatura\u00e7\u00e3o sexual da esp\u00e9cie ocorre a partir de 13,59 e 11,92 mm (CP) para f\u00eameas e machos, respectivamente.

N\u00e3o houve rela\u00e7\u00e3o significativa entre as m\u00e9dias de IGS e os dados abi\u00f3ticos. As t\u00e1ticas reprodutivas apresentadas \npor A. riograndensis indicam uma esp\u00e9cie com estrat\u00e9gia reprodutiva oportunista, seguindo o padr\u00e3o das demais esp\u00e9cies da fam\u00edlia Rivulidade. \n\nPALAVRAS-CHAVE. Atlantirivulus riograndensis, desenvolvimento gonadal, desova m\u00faltipla, fecundidade.\n\nThe Rivulidae family consists of nearly 409 valid \nspecies of annual fish from seasonal and ephemeral habitats \nwhose adults die in dry seasons, and also of non-annual \nfish (Costa, 2009, 2011; Volcan et al., 2010; Eschmeyer \n&amp; Fong, 2015). The non-annual rivulids of Atlantirivulus \nriograndensis (Costa &amp; Lan\u00e9s, 2009) are the object of \nthis study. This species is included on the list of species \nthreatened by extinction in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, \nand classified as in danger (Rio Grande do Sul, 2014).\n\nNon-annual rivulids dwell in perennial wetlands \nthat are subject to floods during the wet season, and stay \npreferably in shaded areas near herbaceous edges (Costa \n&amp; Lan\u00e9s, 2009; Costa, 2011), which are usually sensitive \nto anthropogenic pressures. On the state of Rio Grande do \nSul, natural areas in the Pampa Biome, occupied by rivulids, \nare being lost or altered by agriculture and silviculture, \nendangering species extinction or damaging the population \nbatches (Pillar et al., 2009).\n\nThe annual reproductive strategy rivulids is well \nknown and described for various species. The reproductive \n\nsuccess of these fish with annual cycle is associated with \nthe ability to survive in unstable habitats, with elaborate \ncourtship behaviors, complex processes of embryonic \ndevelopment, and the immersion of eggs into the substrate \nwhere they may remain in diapause until the next rainy \nseason when larvae hatching occurs (Lowe-McConnell, \n1999; Arenzon et al., 2001; Arezo et al., 2005; Costa, \n2011). Other reproductive tactics presented by annual \nrivulids are rapid initial growth, early maturation, low \nfecundity, multiple spawning, long reproductive period \nduring floods (Arenzon et al., 1999, 2001, 2002; Shibatta, \n2005; Volcan et al., 2011).\n\nNon-annual rivulids, on the other hand, inhabit areas \nwith year-round water availability and their spawns occur \non the substrate or on plants (Costa, 2009). Studies related \nto reproductive biology of this group are scarce and are \navailable only for Melanorivulus punctatus (Boulenger, \n1895) species, which presents a long reproductive period \nand a multiple spawn (Cassel et al., 2013).\n\nKnowing about the tactics employed in the life cycle \n\nIheringia, S\u00e9rie Zoologia\n\n\n\nReproductive strategy of a non-annual rivulid in a perennial... 289\n\nDiagrama\u00e7\u00e3o e XML SciELO Publishing Schema: www.editoraletra1.com\n\nIheringia, S\u00e9rie Zoologia, Porto Alegre, 105(3):288-296, 30 de setembro de 2015\n\nof A. riograndensis therefore becomes fundamental for \nan understanding of its reproductive process in its natural \nhabitat and its population dynamics. The study aimed to \ncharacterize the reproductive strategy of A. riograndensis \nin order to define their breeding season, sex ratio, length at \nfirst maturity, spawning type, fecundity, and the possible \nassociations among reproduction and abiotic factors \n(temperature, photoperiod, and precipitation).\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nThe A. riograndensis specimens were collected \nin perennial, preserved wetlands at the Ref\u00fagio da Vida \nSilvestre Banhado dos Pachecos in the town of Viam\u00e3o, \nstate of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (Fig. 1). This refuge \nis a conservation unit and covers an area of 2.560 ha \nof  sandbank brush, swampy forests and countryside \nvegetation that are associated with wetlands and form a \nmosaic (Secretaria do Meio Ambiente do Estado do \nRio Grande do Sul, 2010a,b). The Banhado dos Pachecos \nbelongs to the Banhado Grande area of environmental \nprotection in the hydrographic basin of Patos lagoon.\n\nThe collection site (30\u00b005\u201944\u2019\u2019S, 50\u00ba50\u201959\u2019\u2019W) \ncorresponds to an area three to four meters wide that forms \na strip of still, turbid water near a swamp forest (Fig. 2). It \nfeatures lots of submerged, emergent, floating and marginal \nvegetation. The depth varies from 10 cm to one and a half \nmeters and the substrate is muddy, as is characteristic of \nwetlands.\n\nFish samples were taken with authorization from the \nSecretaria do Meio Ambiente do Estado do Rio Grande do \nSul (number 52/2012 and register number 395). This study \nwas conducted in accordance with protocols approved in \ntheir ethical and methodological aspects, for the use of fish, \nby the Ethics Committee on Animal Use of the Universidade \nFederal do Rio Grande do Sul (Permit Number: 24434). \n\nThe collections of biological material occurred from \nJanuary to December of 2012, with a monthly sampling of \n30 specimens of A. riograndensis. Sampling occurred with \n500 mm x 300 mm dip nets with mesh of one mm between \nadjacent knots, exploring different extracts of the water \ncolumn to sample from juveniles to adults. Specimens were \neuthanized with eugenol (clove oil) with a concentration of \n75 mg L-1, fixed in 10% formalin while still in the field and \nconserved in the laboratory in 70% alcohol. The voucher \nspecimens were deposited in the ichthyology collection of \nthe Departamento de Zoologia at the Universidade Federal \ndo Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS 17266, 17267).\n\nWater temperature was recorded during collection \nexpeditions with a thermometer at a depth of 20 cm, along \nthe vegetation and around 12 pm. The monthly amounts \nof precipitation in millimeters and length of sunshine in \nhours were both obtained at the 8th District of Meteorology \nof Porto Alegre, recorded at station 83967 and publicly \navailable at the bank of Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia, \nBrazil (Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia, 2013).\n\nThe data for standard length (SL) in millimeters, \ntotal weight and gonad weight in grams were recorded for \neach captured individual. The observations of dichromatic \nsexual dimorphism, i.e., the presence of an ocellated black \nspot on the caudal peduncle of the females (Costa, 2011), \nand macro/microscopic analysis of the gonads were used \nfor sexing the individuals. The reproductive period was \nidentified by analyzing the variation of gonadal maturation \nphases, and the gonadosomatic index (GSI) (Vazzoler, \n1996). Monthly variations of the GSI were tested with an \nanalysis of variance (ANOVA) and subjected to the post-\nhoc Tukey HSD test (honestly significant difference) with \nmultiple comparisons (Zar, 1999). Residue analysis using \nANOVA were utilized to verify the normality of the data \n(Legendre &amp; Legendre, 1998).\n\nThe gonads of 110 individuals in different phases \nof maturation were submitted to histology embedded in a \nglycolmethacrylate resin on a slide three ?m in thickness \nand stained with hematoxylin-eosin or toluidine blue. \nThese gonads were classified into phases of gonadal \n\nFig. 1.

All of the \nindividuals macroscopically classified as immature were \nsubmitted to histology to confirm the sex and phase of \ngonadal maturation.\n\nA multiple regression with stepwise method was \nused to test the mean monthly variation of GSI (dependent \nvariable) in relation to the average monthly water \ntemperature, photoperiod (in hours), and rainfall. Abiotic \ndata were log-transformed to meet the assumptions of the \nstatistical test. Residue analysis using multiple regression \nwere utilized to verify the normality of the data (Legendre \n&amp; Legendre, 1998).\n\nThe total and monthly sex ratio was evaluated \nby chi-square test (?\u00b2) (Legendre &amp; Legendre, 1998). \nStatistical tests were performed using the R Project for \nStatistical Computing version 3.0.2. and vegan package \nversion 2.0.\n\nThe absolute fecundity of the species was established \nfrom the counting of vitellogenic oocytes from 15 spawning \ncapable females (sensu Brown-Peterson et al., 2011), \nas these possessed the highest GSI values among the \ncaptured females. The relative fecundity was expressed \nas the number of vitellogenic oocytes per milligram of \ntotal weight (Adebisi, 1987).\n\nThe same 15 spawning capable females were used to \nestimate the spawning type. Therefore, the total number of \noocytes present in the ovaries was counted and measured. \nThe spawning type was inferred based on the distribution \nof the modes of oocyte diameters, and also the histological \nanalysis based on the oocyte developmental stages and the \npresence of post-ovulatory follicles and atretic oocytes \n(Brown-Peterson et al., 2011).  Histological analysis \ncontributed in the identification of spawning types in \nfunction of the possible presence of post-ovulatory follicles \nand maturing oocytes on ovaries that were considered \nmature.  These are ovaries with high GSI values, which \nindicate that at the same time in which some oocytes are \nbeing spawned, others are in both early and late stages of \nmaturation and will be released in the current reproductive \nperiod forming a batch spawn (Brown-Peterson et al., \n2011). \n\nRESULTS\n\nThe collections of biological material resulted in \nthe capture of 188 females (SL between 10.59-44.53 mm) \nand 172 males (SL between 11.92-41.35 mm). Histological \nanalysis revealed that males and females with standard \nlengths of less than 20 mm can be confused when only \ntheir external appearance is evaluated, because not show \napparent sexual dimorphism of coloration. Therefore, \nthe classification of specimens into male or female can \nfollow sexual dimorphism of coloration only after they have \nreached 20 mm of standard length. Previous to this, males \nmay present coloration equal to the females, including a \nspot equal to the ocellated black dot they present on the \ncaudal peduncle.\n\nRegarding the phases of gonadal maturation the \nfemale\u2019s ovaries were classified as immature, developing, \nspawning capable, regressing and regenerating. Immature \nfemales were those that never spawned, showing ovaries \nwith little space between the oocytes and an absence of \nevident muscle bundles or atresia and germinate cells \nin oogonia stage or oocytes in primary growth (Fig. 3). \nThe immature phase concludes before the presence of \noocytes with cortical alveolar vesicles (Fig. 4). Developing \novaries presented primary oocytes and primary and \nsecondary vitellogenesis, and the tertiary vitellogenesis \nor post-ovulatory follicles were absent (Fig. 5). Spawning \ncapable females showed large ovaries with prominent blood \nvessels, germinate cells in a state of primary, secondary and \ntertiary vitellogenesis, mature and macroscopically visible \noocytes and post-ovulatory follicles (Fig. 6). Regressing \nfemales showed small, flaccid ovaries, interspaced cells, the \npresence of atresia and some vitellogenic oocytes (Fig. 7). \nRegenerating females exhibited small ovaries, a reduction \nof blood vessels, a thick and aged ovarian wall, and the \npresence of primary oocytes and oogonia. The regenerating \nphase was characterized in only one individual of large \nsize (SL: 44.53 mm) in January (Fig. 8).\n\nMales of immature, regressing, and regenerating \nphases were not observed among specimens of A. \nriograndensis captured in Banhado dos Pachecos. The \nmale gonads of A. riograndensis presented themselves \nas reproductive (able to spawn) in all months of the year. \nDeveloping and spawning capable phases are identified \nby presenting, respectively: a continuous germinative \nepithelium, spermatogonia, spermatocytes and spermatids, \nbut without the release of spermatozoa in the lumen of the \nsperm ducts or lobules; and testes that can show all stages \nof spermatogenesis, with the release of spermatozoa in the \nlumen and duct (Figs. 9, 10, 11).\n\nThe male testes are classified as restricted lobulars \n(Figs. 9, 10, 11), with spermatogonias occurring in cysts \nonly in the distal portion of the lobes. The cysts are \nmaintained during spermatogenesis and rupture to release \nthe spermatozoa.\n\nHistological analysis showed that spawning capable \nfemales occurred from August to March, coinciding with \nseasons of higher temperatures (an average of 21\u00b0C in the \nspring and 23\u00b0C in the summer) and longer sunshine (an \naverage of 231 hours in the spring and 262 hours in the \nsummer, although there was no significant relationship \nbetween mean GSI and these abiotic data, nor with rainfall \n(females: F = 1.16, p = 0.38; males: F = 0.49, p = 0.69).\n\nSpawning was most evident in the months of \nNovember, December and March, corresponding to the \nfalls in the GSI values of females and males (Figs. 12, \n13). The months of April and May, mainly, corresponded \nto a period of regression of female gonads and the months \nof June and July marked the beginning of the developing \nphase (Fig. 14). GSI values differed over these months \nconfirming a reproductive period set between the spring \n(October, November and December) and summer (January, \n\n\n\nReproductive strategy of a non-annual rivulid in a perennial... 291\n\nDiagrama\u00e7\u00e3o e XML SciELO Publishing Schema: www.editoraletra1.com\n\nIheringia, S\u00e9rie Zoologia, Porto Alegre, 105(3):288-296, 30 de setembro de 2015\n\nFebruary and March) in the southern hemisphere (females: \nF = 7.58, p &lt;0.0001, df = 11; males: F = 7.33, p &lt;0.0001, \ndf = 11).\n\nOnly five female gonads (taken from specimens with \n\na standard length ranging between 10.59 and 13.91 mm) \nwere classified as immature.

The smallest female found with gonads in early \ndevelopment had 13.59 mm of standard length (Fig. 4). The \nsmallest male found was 11.92 mm long and histological \nsections showed a developing gonad with the presence of \nspermatozoa, although in reduced numbers. Based on these \ndata, the size of the first gonadal development for females \nand males of A. riograndensis was estimated.\n\nThe sex ratio of males and females in relation to \nthe total sampled population was 1:1 as shown in the chi-\nsquare test (?\u00b2 = 0.71, p > 0.05, df = 1), however a higher \nincidence of males was registered in June (?\u00b2 = 0.71, p &lt;\n0.05, df = 1) (ratio of 2.3:1) and of females in the months \nof August (?\u00b2 = 0.71, p &lt;0.05, df = 1) and September (?\u00b2 \n= 0.71, p &lt;0.05, df = 1), (ratio of 2.3:1).\n\nThe estimated average absolute fecundity was 19.33 \n(\u00b1 6.18) oocytes, with minimum and maximum values of \nnine and 34 vitellogenic oocytes (respectively) and the \naverage relative fecundity was 0.06 (\u00b1 0.01) oocyte per \nmilligram of total weight. The maximum diameter of the \nvitellogenic oocytes was 2.14 mm and the average was \n1.57 (\u00b1 0.32) mm. \n\nAnalysis of the distribution of the total number of \noocytes per diameter class revealed more than two modes, \ncharacterizing a synchronous oocyte development into \nmore than two groups (Fig. 15). Histological analysis in \ngonads of females considered spawning capable confirmed \nthis multiple spawning showing batches of oocytes at \ndifferent stages of development with intermediate and final \nvitellogenic oocytes and evidence of previous spawning \nwith the presence of post-ovulatory follicles.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe long reproductive period described for A. \nriograndensis in this study is quite well known among \nindividuals of the Rivulidae family (Arenzon et al., 1999; \nArezo et al., 2007; Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2011; Cassel et al., \n2013). Among annual rivulids, Austrolebias charrua Costa \n&amp; Cheffe, 2001 showed all phases of sexual maturation \nfrom May to December, with December characterized as \n\nthe month of senescence since the adults of this species \ndie in the dry season (Arezo et al., 2007). Cynopoecilus \nmultipapillatus Costa, 2002, on the other hand, has no \ndefined breeding season; spawning continually and with \ngonadal maturation, interrupted only by the death of adult \nfish during the dry season (December to January) (Arenzon \net al., 1999). \n\nAtlantirivulus riograndensis reproduced in the \nspring and summer seasons like M. punctatus, another \nrepresentative of the non-annual rivulids, which showed \nfemales in the developing phase from May to September \nand a breeding season corresponding to the months from \nOctober to March (Cassel et al., 2013). Moreover, the \npattern amongst males of being spawning capable year \nlong (characteristic of A. riograndensis) also occurs in M. \npunctatus whose male reproductive cycle was characterized \nas continuous, largely uninfluenced by environmental factors \nand in which phases of gonadal maturation and regressing \nand regenerating phases were unobserved (Cassel et al., \n2013). The regenerating phase also seems to occur very \nquickly for female rivulids since in A. riograndensis only \none female was captured in this phase of gonad maturation \nand in M. punctatus this phase cannot be registered among \nfemales of the species (Cassel et al., 2013). According to \nstatistical analysis, environmental factors studied did not \naffect the reproduction of A. riograndensis in Banhado \ndos Pachecos, just like the males of M. punctatus (Cassel \net al., 2013)\n\nAtlantirivulus riograndensis presented females \nwith gonads in early development starting at 13.59 mm \nof standard length and C. multipapillatus presented this \nphase of development between the total length of 8.20 and \n14.20 mm (Arenzon et al., 1999). In the ovaries of A. \ncharrua, about 45 days after larval eclosion, vitellogenic \noocytes were present in some individuals and cortical \nalveolar vesicles in others (Arezo et al., 2007), which \ncorrespond to the final stage of oocytes in primary growth \nand the initiation of vitellogenesis - thus characterizing \nfemales as in early gonadal development.\n\nClassification between male and female A. \nriograndensis with standard lengths less than 20 mm can be \nconfusing when histological analyzes are not performed and \nonly sexual dimorphism in color or macroscopic analysis \nof the gonads are considered. This is because females \nof less than 20 mm may present very similar gonads to \nthose of males due to the absence of macroscopically \nvisible oocytes. Furthermore, sexual dimorphism in color \nin this length range still may not have been developed in all \nindividuals of the population, with some males presenting \nan ocellated black spot on the caudal peduncle equal to that \nof females and an absence of a greenish tint throughout the \nbody that, according to the descriptive article of the species \n(Costa &amp; Lan\u00e9s, 2009), characterizes them.\n\nRegarding population composition, rivulids have \nbeen found with different sex ratios, e.g. with females \nbeing more abundant in the species A. riograndensis, \n\nFig. 15.

These factors could be included the susceptibility \nof females for capture during the reproductive period due \nto the weight of the gonads, or the selectivity of sampling \ntechniques as mentioned by Dala-Corte &amp; Fialho (2014) \nfor Deuterodon stigmaturus (Gomes, 1947).\n\nThe synchronous maturation of oocyte lots which \nare released at intervals throughout the reproductive season \nsuggests a multiple spawn (Ganias, 2013). This pattern \nof oocyte development was identified in A. riograndensis \nand registered for the annual Austrolebias toba Calvi\u00f1o, \n2006, Austrolebias nigrofasciatus Costa &amp; Cheffe, 2001, C. \nmelanotaenia, C. multipapillatus and S. boitonei (Arenzon \net al., 1999; Calvi\u00f1o, 2006; Shibatta, 2005; Gon\u00e7alves \net al., 2011; Volcan et al., 2011, 2013) and the-non \nannual M. punctatus (Cassel et al., 2013). For fish of \nlentic habitats, multiple spawning during the reproductive \nperiod may reduce competition among larvae when they \nhave a lower rate of dispersion (Godinho et al., 2010) \nand also represent an advantage in unstable environments \nregarding abiotic factors, since they allow for some batches \nof oocytes to be released in relatively better environmental \nconditions which increases the chances of survival for \nyoung offspring. This reproductive tactic seems especially \nessential in annual rivulids as they can often find habitats \nin extremely variables conditions. Adaptive advantages \nassociated with multiple spawns can consist in the survival \nof some batches of oocytes when conditions are unfavorable \ndue to fluctuations in water levels (Lowe-McConnell, \n1999), or an increase in the quantity of produced oocytes \nbeing more than the size permitted by the species in a total \nspawn (Ganias, 2013). This reproductive tactic for C. \nmelanotaenia was reported as a way to increase the survival \nof juveniles in unpredictable environmental (Gon\u00e7alves \net al., 2011).\n\nIn long reproductive periods, multiple spawning is \nrelated to undetermined fecundity rates (Ganias, 2013). \nIn these situations only the oocyte batches in advanced \nmaturation fail to indicate the annual fecundity of the \n\nspecies, because new oocyte batches in primary growth \nare recruited during the breeding season whereas mature \noocytes are eliminated in a pattern of oocyte recruitment \nthat completely overlaps the spawn (Ganias, 2013). With \nmultiple spawning occurring during the breeding season, \nthe count of vitellogenic oocytes present in the ovaries \ncan therefore be underestimated, thus explaining the low \nfecundity found for A. riograndensis, compared to the \nfecundity rate of other rivulids (Arenzon et al., 1999).  \nFor this very same reason, the low number of oocytes \npresent between diameters 1.43 to 1.71 and 1.86 to 2.14 \nmm is explained, which show two distinct modes of oocyte \ndevelopment.\n\nAlthough a pattern of indeterminate fecundity \ncharacterizes the species, the estimated fecundity values \nfor A. riograndensis can be useful in comparing them \nto annual rivulids and characterizing their reproductive \nstrategy. Fecundity seems to be mainly regulated by habitat, \nbased on evidence of fish population units with a wide \ngeographic distribution and genera with populations that \ninhabit distinct environments and present differences in \nthe estimates of the number of oocytes produced in each \nbreeding season (Ganias, 2013).\n\nThe fecundity and oocyte size found for A. \nriograndensis meets other species of annual killifish, such \nas: Austrolebias toba presented an approximate fecundity \nof 57 oocytes per female per week with diameters ranging \nbetween 1.4 and 1.6 mm; A. nigrofasciatus apresentou \n21.5 oocytes per female per week and an average diameter \nof 1.5 mm; C. melanotaenia averaged 19 oocytes in the \nreproductive period; C. multipapillatus presented fecundity \nvaried between 49 and 219 oocytes with a mean diameter \nof 1.15 mm; S. boitonei was estimated at three oocytes \nper female for every day of spawning with an average \ndiameter of 1.6mm (Arenzon et al., 1999; Calvi\u00f1o, \n2006; Shibatta, 2005; Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2011; Volcan \net al., 2011). Production rates (by number) and egg size, \nas registered by Moshgani &amp; Van Dooren (2011) for \nAustrolebias nigripinnis (Regan 1912), can be influenced \nby environmental conditions or by the presence of males, \nsuch that the female-male interaction effect contributes to \nvariation in the reproductive effort of these fish.\n\nBased on these data, rivulids show a high energy \ninvestment in producing better quality oocytes with larger \nquantities of yolk and the attempt to increase the number \nof oocytes recruited by breeding season (since the priority \nof energy investment is in the size of these oocytes) occurs \ntherefore with the tactic of multiple spawning over a long \nreproductive period. This results in a fecundity that far \nexceeds female body mass in these species of small size \n(Winemiller &amp; Rose, 1992).\n\nLarge oocytes is a reproductive tactic that reported \nequilibrium strategy, while for opportunistic strategists \nthe allocation of energy mainly for fast reproduction is \ncited, seeking numerous offspring to compensate for \nthe high mortality rates of juveniles in their ephemeral \nand unfavorable habitats (Stearns, 2000; Reznick \n\n\n\nReproductive strategy of a non-annual rivulid in a perennial... 295\n\nDiagrama\u00e7\u00e3o e XML SciELO Publishing Schema: www.editoraletra1.com\n\nIheringia, S\u00e9rie Zoologia, Porto Alegre, 105(3):288-296, 30 de setembro de 2015\n\net al., 2002; Mims &amp; Olden, 2012). Atlantirivulus \nriograndensis, although it possesses large oocytes, \ncannot be considered an equilibrium strategist because \nit presentes a set of opportunistic tactics that allow for \nrapid habitat colonization, as described for the order of \nCyprinodontiformes by Winemiller (1989) in studies of \nthe families Cyprinodontidae and Poeciliidae. The tactics \nthat characterize opportunistic strategy for A. riograndensis \nare a small body size, a prolonged spawing period, and a \nparceled spawn with small oocyte batches.\n\nOpportunistic fish, however, may also present \nmechanisms that seek to increase survival rates of juveniles \nin variables habitats. The tactic of producing large oocytes \nthat is present in some opportunistic fish (as identified in A. \nriograndensis in this study) is one of these mechanisms and \nseeks to ensure that the early stages of larval development \ncan utilize the large quantity of yolk as an important source \nof energy in adverse conditions (Winemiller &amp; Rose, \n1992).\n\nIn order to contain the mortality of juveniles, \nopportunist fish invest in high rates of early growth with \nearly sexual maturation and thus maximize the rates \nof intrinsic population growth by reducing the average \ngeneration time (Winemiller &amp; Rose, 1992; Fonseca &amp; \nCabral, 2007). The probability of survival of larvae in \nthe early stages of life increases with rapid initial growth \nbecause, among other advantages, larger larvae have \nhigher feeding rates and reduced vulnerability to predators \n(Fonseca &amp; Cabral, 2007).\n\nAtlantirivulus riograndensis presents, therefore, \nthe same reproductive tactics found in annual rivulids with \nthe exception of those associated with annualism. Thus, \nthe species is characterized as an opportunistic strategist, \nwith a long reproductive period (spawning capable females \nfrom August to March and males in the extrusion capable \nphase year round) and increase in fecundity rates through \na parceled spawn.  \n\nAcknowledgments.
