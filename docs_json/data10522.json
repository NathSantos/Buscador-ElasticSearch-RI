Micropl\u00e1sticos ent\u00e3o presentes na superf\u00edcie dos \n\noceanos, em praias arenosas e ambientes lamosos, desde o Equador at\u00e9 os P\u00f3los, em praias urbanas \n\ne regi\u00f5es remotas do globo, e ainda depositados em sedimentos profundos (>2.000m). \n\nExperimentos de laborat\u00f3rio indicam que estas part\u00edculas pl\u00e1sticas podem ser ingeridas por \n\norganismos de todos os n\u00edveis da teia tr\u00f3fica marinha. Poluentes org\u00e2nicos, como DDTs e PCBs, e \n\ninorg\u00e2nicos presentes na \u00e1gua do mar podem estar adsorvidos a estes pl\u00e1sticos, transportando \n\ncontaminantes qu\u00edmicos para diversas regi\u00f5es do globo, ou sendo liberados quando no trato \n\ngastrointestinal de vertebrados e invertebrados se ingeridos, podendo ainda ser transportados ao \n\nlongo da teia tr\u00f3fica marinha. H\u00e1 mais de 10 anos relata-se que no Oceano Pac\u00edfico Norte \n\nmicropl\u00e1sticos est\u00e3o presentes principalmente no centro do giro subtropical, aparentemente \n\ninfluenciados por vari\u00e1veis oceanogr\u00e1ficas. Para o Oceano Atl\u00e2ntico tropical, evid\u00eancias sobre a \n\npresen\u00e7a de micropl\u00e1sticos existiam apenas para as praias arenosas do Arquip\u00e9lago de Fernando de \n\nNoronha (3\u00b0S, 32\u00b0W), e para as \u00e1guas adjacentes ao Arquip\u00e9lago de S\u00e3o Pedro e S\u00e3o Paulo. Para \n\npreencher esta lacuna, micropl\u00e1sticos foram o foco da amostragem em tr\u00eas importantes ambientes \n\ninsulares no oeste do Oceano Atl\u00e2ntico tropical: Arquip\u00e9lago de Fernando de Noronha, \n\nArquip\u00e9lago de Abrolhos (17\u00b0S, 38\u00b0W) e a Ilha da Trindade (20\u00b0S, 29\u00b0W) em 4 expedi\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ncient\u00edficas realizadas entre dezembro de 2011 e mar\u00e7o de 2013. Pl\u00e1sticos flutuantes foram \n\namostrados atrav\u00e9s de arrastos planct\u00f4nicos (neuston) nas \u00e1reas marinhas adjacentes a estes \n\nambientes. Um total de 160 arrastos foi realizado. Em Trindade, mais de 90% dos arrastos estavam \n\ncontaminados por micropl\u00e1sticos, identificados como fragmentos duros, fragmentos moles, paint \n\nchips, linhas e fibras. Em Noronha e Abrolhos aproximadamente metade dos arrastos estava \n\ncontaminada. Fragmentos pl\u00e1sticos duros foram os tipos de itens mais amostrados assim como em \n\noutros estudos de micropl\u00e1sticos em amostras de pl\u00e2ncton. Entre os fragmentos, >75% tinham 5mm \n\nou menos. A contamina\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00e9dia foi de 0,03 part\u00edculas por m\u00b3, inferior \u00e0s quantidades previamente \n\nconhecidas no Oceano Pac\u00edfico. As amostras de micropl\u00e1sticos depositados na superf\u00edcie do \n\nsedimento foram coletadas nas praias arenosas em cada uma das ilhas atrav\u00e9s de quadrantes. As \n\namostras coletadas tamb\u00e9m foram analisadas quanto a granulometria predominante, j\u00e1 que estas \n\ninforma\u00e7\u00f5es ainda eram inexistentes para as ilhas estudadas. Em Abrolhos nenhuma part\u00edcula \n\npl\u00e1stica foi amostrada. Fragmentos pl\u00e1sticos duros e esf\u00e9rulas pl\u00e1sticas foram identificados somente \n\nem Fernando de Noronha e Trindade, sendo que o lado mais exposto \u00e0 a\u00e7\u00e3o de ventos e corrente \n\nsuperficias predominantes estava mais contaminado, quando comparado ao lado relativamente mais \n\nprotegido nas ilhas estudadas. Estes resultados s\u00e3o os primeiros ind\u00edcios da contamina\u00e7\u00e3o do oeste \n\ndo Oceano Atl\u00e2ntico tropical em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 contamina\u00e7\u00e3o por micropl\u00e1sticos. A presen\u00e7a destes \n\nmicropl\u00e1sticos alerta para a vulnerabilidade destas ilhas e sua biota em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e1 contamina\u00e7\u00e3o por \n\npl\u00e1sticos.  \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Amaz\u00f4nia Azul, ilhas oce\u00e2nicas brasileiras, lixo marinho, pellets, transporte por \n\nlonga dist\u00e2ncia.  \n\n\n\nvi \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\nRecently, the scientific community is focussed on the identification, characterization e \n\nquantification of microplastics, defined in the literature as those plastic particles with less than 5 \n\nmillimetres. Microplastics are widespread on the ocean\u2019s surface, on sand beaches and mud \n\nsediments, from the equator to the poles, on urban beaches and remote regions in the globe, and \n\neven deposited on deep sediments (>2,000m). Laboratory experiments indicate that organisms from \n\nevery level of the marine food web potentially ingest microplastic particles. Organic, such as DDTs \n\nand PCBs, and inorganic pollutants available in seawater may adsorbed onto microplastics, \n\ntransporting chemical contaminants to diverse regions in the globe, or being released in the \n\ngastrointestinal tract of vertebrates and invertebrates if ingested, when they are even transported \n\nalong the marine food web. For more than 10 years, there were reports on the occurrence of \n\nmicroplastics in the North Pacific Ocean, mainly in the centre of the subtropical gyre, probably \n\ninfluenced by oceanographic variables. To the tropical Atlantic Ocean, however, evidences on the \n\npresence of microplastics were available only to sandy beaches in the Fernando de Noronha \n\nArchipelago (3\u00b0S, 32\u00b0W), and to waters around the S\u00e3o Pedro e S\u00e3o Paulo Archipelago. To fulfil \n\nthis gap, microplastics were studied in three important insular environments in the western Atlantic \n\nOcean: the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago, the Abrolhos Archipelago (17\u00b0S, 38\u00b0W) and the \n\nTrindade island (20\u00b0S, 29\u00b0W), during four scientific expeditions between December 2011 and \n\nMarch 2103. Floating plastics were collected by plankton tows (neuston) on the sea surface in the \n\nadjacent region to these environments. A total of 160 tows were conducted. In Trindade Island, \n\nmore than 90% of the tows were contaminated with microplastics, identified as hard plastic \n\nfragments, soft fragments, paint chips, lines and fibres. In Fernando de Noronha and Abrolhos, \n\napproximately half of the tows were contaminated. Hard plastic fragments were the majority of the \n\nsampled items, as well as reported in other studies with plankton samples. Among plastic \n\nfragments, >75% had 5mm or less. The mean contamination pattern was 0.03 particles/m\u00b3, less than \n\npreviously reported on the Pacific Ocean. Microplastics sampled on sediments were collected on \n\nsandy beaches in each island by quadrants dispoded in the strandline. Samples were also analysed \n\nin the relation to the main grain size of sediments because these information was still non-existent \n\nto the studied islands. In Abrolhos, no plastic particle was sampled. Hard plastic fragments and \n\nplastic pellets were identified in Fernando de Noronha and Trindade, where the windward side of \n\nthe islans were significantly more contaminated when compared to the leeward side. These results \n\nare the first results indicating the occurrence of microplastic debris particles in the Western tropical \n\nAtlantic Ocean. The occurrence of microplastics highlights the vulnerability of these islands and \n\ntheir biota in relation to microplastic pollution.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords: Blue Amazon, Brazilian oceanic islands, marine debris, pellets, long-range transport. \n\n\n\n1 \n\n \n\nINTRODU\u00c7\u00c3O \n\nO termo pl\u00e1stico significa \u201cmale\u00e1vel\u201d ou \u201cflex\u00edvel\u201d. As primeiras pesquisas que deram origem \n\n\u00e0 descoberta dos pl\u00e1sticos que conhecemos atualmente datam de meados do S\u00e9culo XIX (Moore e \n\nPhillips 2010). Cem anos depois, impulsionada pelas crescentes necessidades de uma sociedade de \n\nconsumo e pelos advindos da II Guerra Mundial, a j\u00e1 bem estabelecida ind\u00fastria dos pl\u00e1sticos \n\ncome\u00e7a ent\u00e3o a produzi-los em grandes quantidades. At\u00e9 hoje novos materiais (pol\u00edmeros) - que \n\ncomo os primeiros pl\u00e1sticos s\u00e3o obtidos do petr\u00f3leo, g\u00e1s natural e carv\u00e3o - s\u00e3o descobertos e \n\ncomercializados, alimentando uma ind\u00fastria que produz mais de duzentas milh\u00f5es de toneladas por \n\nano. Entre os pl\u00e1sticos ou pol\u00edmeros mais utilizados, e consequentemente, mais descartados pela \n\nsociedade moderna, est\u00e3o o polietileno (PE) de alta e baixa densidades, polipropileno (PP), cloreto \n\nde polivinila (PVC), poliestireno (PS) e tereftalato de polietileno (PET) (Thompson et al. 2009). \n\nJuntos, eles representam cerca de 90% da produ\u00e7\u00e3o global de pl\u00e1sticos (Andrady 2011). As \n\npossibilidades tecnol\u00f3gicas oferecidas pelos pol\u00edmeros nunca foram t\u00e3o grandes; nenhum material \n\nutilizado pela sociedade jamais foi t\u00e3o flex\u00edvel e mold\u00e1vel \u00e0s nossas necessidades. \n\nDuas das caracter\u00edsticas que fazem do pl\u00e1stico um material t\u00e3o \u00fatil \u00e0 sociedade \u2013 seu baixo \n\npeso e durabilidade \u2013 tamb\u00e9m fazem com que os pl\u00e1sticos descartados de forma inapropriada causem \n\ndanos significativos ao meio ambiente (Ryan et al. 2009). A presen\u00e7a de res\u00edduos pl\u00e1sticos >5 mm, \n\ndenominados macropl\u00e1sticos, em ambientes marinhos e costeiros foi extensivamente documentada \n\npela literatura cient\u00edfica especializada nos \u00faltimos 40 anos (Moore 2008), inclusive no litoral do \n\nBrasil (Ivar do Sul e Costa 2007, Santos et al. 2009, Ivar do Sul et al. 2011). Entre os danos mais \n\nvis\u00edveis \u00e0 biota est\u00e3o o enredamento, a ingest\u00e3o e o poss\u00edvel transporte marinho de invertebrados \n\nincrustantes que se fixam \u00e0 superf\u00edcie dos pl\u00e1sticos (Moore 2008, Barnes et al. 2009).  \n\nNos ambientes costeiros e marinhos, os macropl\u00e1sticos come\u00e7am a sofrer sucessivos processos \n\nde degrada\u00e7\u00e3o, induzidos principalmente pela luz do sol (processos foto-oxidativos). Com sua \n\nestrutura molecular fragilizada, os pl\u00e1sticos come\u00e7am ent\u00e3o a se fragmentar em peda\u00e7os cada vez \n\nmenores, em um processo lento mas significativo (Barnes et al. 2009, Costa et al. 2009, Ivar do Sul \n\net al. 2009, Ivar do Sul e Costa 2014), que ocorre provavelmente at\u00e9 atingir o n\u00edvel molecular, \n\nquando estes j\u00e1 se encontram descaracterizados em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao pol\u00edmero inicial/precursor. \n\nRecentemente (~5 anos) a comunidade cient\u00edfica especializada vem concentrando seus \n\nesfor\u00e7os na identifica\u00e7\u00e3o, caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o e quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o, em escala global, de fragmentos pl\u00e1sticos \n\nde pequenas dimens\u00f5es (<5 mm), denominados micropl\u00e1sticos (por exemplo, Browne et al. 2011). \n\nAlgumas defini\u00e7\u00f5es j\u00e1 foram amplamente aceitas por esta comunidade, destacando-se a classifica\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndos micropl\u00e1sticos pela sua fonte ou origem (Arthur et al. 2009). Esf\u00e9rulas de pl\u00e1stico virgens e \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\noutras part\u00edculas que chegam aos ambientes costeiros e marinhos por derramamentos acidentais \n\ndurante o manuseio e transporte e/ou sistemas de drenagens de esgotos (Moore 2008, Fendal e \n\nSewell 2009), j\u00e1 com forma e tamanho definidos, foram classificadas como prim\u00e1rias (fontes \n\nprim\u00e1rias). J\u00e1 as part\u00edculas pl\u00e1sticas, formadas no ambiente por cont\u00ednuos processos de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\nfragmenta\u00e7\u00e3o, foram classificadas como secund\u00e1rias (fontes secund\u00e1rias).  \n\nDezenas de estudos confirmam a presen\u00e7a de micropl\u00e1sticos flutuantes nos Oceanos Pac\u00edfico \n\nNorte, Pac\u00edfico Sul, Mediterr\u00e2neo e Atl\u00e2ntico Norte (Cole et al. 2011, Ivar do Sul e Costa 2014). \u00c9 \n\nposs\u00edvel que, por fatores oceanogr\u00e1ficos, estes micropl\u00e1sticos se concentrem principalmente no \n\ncentro dos giros subtropicais (Moore et al. 2001). Nos sedimentos de praias arenosas, micropl\u00e1sticos \n\nforam amostrados em pelo menos seis continentes. Aparentemente, regi\u00f5es pr\u00f3ximas \u00e0s \n\naglomera\u00e7\u00f5es urbanas apresentaram maiores concentra\u00e7\u00f5es, indicando a poss\u00edvel influ\u00eancia dos \n\nsistemas de drenagem de esgotos (Browne et al. 2011).  \n\nOs micropl\u00e1sticos s\u00e3o ainda mais pervasivos que os res\u00edduos pl\u00e1sticos grandes quando est\u00e3o no \n\nambiente marinho, atingindo praticamente todos os n\u00edveis da teia tr\u00f3fica atrav\u00e9s de sua ingest\u00e3o \n\n(Wright et al. 2013, Ivar do Sul e Costa 2014). Poluentes org\u00e2nicos, como DDTs e PCBs, e \n\ninorg\u00e2nicos presentes na \u00e1gua do mar podem adsorver-se a estes micropl\u00e1sticos (Mato et al. 2001), \n\ntransportando contaminantes qu\u00edmicos para diversas regi\u00f5es do globo incluindo os polos (Zarfl e \n\nMatthies 2010), ou sendo liberados no trato gastrointestinal de vertebrados e invertebrados quando \n\ningeridos (Tanaka et al. 2013), sendo ent\u00e3o transferidos ao longo da teia tr\u00f3fica marinha.  \n\nNo Brasil, estudos com res\u00edduos pl\u00e1sticos em ambientes costeiros s\u00e3o realizados desde o final \n\nda d\u00e9cada de 1990 (Ivar do Sul e Costa 2007). Por\u00e9m, estudos sistem\u00e1ticos relacionados \u00e0 presen\u00e7a \n\nde micropl\u00e1sticos em praias arenosas come\u00e7aram somente no final da d\u00e9cada de 2000 (Ivar do Sul et \n\nal. 2009, Costa et al. 2009). Nestes estudos foi identificada, pela primeira vez, a presen\u00e7a de \n\nesf\u00e9rulas pl\u00e1sticas no Arquip\u00e9lago de Fernando de Noronha, oeste do Oceano Atl\u00e2ntico tropical, e na \n\nPraia da Boa Viagem, um dos principais destinos tur\u00edsticos do estado de Pernambuco, NE do Brasil. \n\nRegistros de esf\u00e9rulas pl\u00e1sticas e fragmentos pl\u00e1sticos de pequenas dimens\u00f5es em Fernando de \n\nNoronha s\u00e3o um indicativo de que micro part\u00edculas de pl\u00e1stico estariam n\u00e3o s\u00f3 depositadas em praias \n\narenosas nesta ilha, mas distribu\u00eddas em todo oeste do Oceano Atl\u00e2ntico tropical, incluindo outros \n\nambientes insulares inseridos no contexto da Amaz\u00f4nia Azul. Entretanto aspectos relacionados \u00e0 \n\npolui\u00e7\u00e3o destes ambientes por micropl\u00e1sticos eram, at\u00e9 o momento, desconhecidos apesar de serem \n\npriorit\u00e1rios devido a sua grande import\u00e2ncia ecol\u00f3gica e conservacional.  \n\nSeguindo as tend\u00eancias da comunidade cient\u00edfica internacional para estudos sobre \n\nmicropl\u00e1sticos em ambientes insulares e devido \u00e0 aus\u00eancia de estudos na Zona Econ\u00f4mica Exclusiva \n\nBrasileira, a principal hip\u00f3tese desta tese de doutorado foi de que micropl\u00e1sticos pel\u00e1gicos est\u00e3o \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\npresentes na superf\u00edcie do mar, em regi\u00f5es adjacentes \u00e0s ilhas oce\u00e2nicas brasileiras, bem como \n\ndepositados em suas praias arenosas. As amostragens foram concentradas em tr\u00eas importantes \n\nambientes insulares: o Arquip\u00e9lago de Fernando de Noronha (3\u00b0S, 32\u00b0W), o Arquip\u00e9lago de \n\nAbrolhos (17\u00b0S, 38\u00b0W) e a Ilha da Trindade (20\u00b0S, 29\u00b0W). Pl\u00e1sticos flutuantes foram amostrados, \n\npela primeira vez, atrav\u00e9s de arrastos planct\u00f4nicos (neuston) nas \u00e1reas marinhas adjacentes a estes \n\nambientes. As amostras de micropl\u00e1sticos depositados no sedimento foram coletadas nas praias \n\narenosas em cada uma das ilhas, seguindo metodologia previamente estabelecida (Ivar do Sul et al. \n\n2009). \n\n \n\nObjetivo geral: identificar e caracterizar a polui\u00e7\u00e3o por micropl\u00e1sticos em Fernando de \n\nNoronha, Abrolhos e Trindade, oeste do Oceano Atl\u00e2ntico tropical.  \n\n \n\nObjetivos espec\u00edficos: \n\n? Identificar e caracterizar a polui\u00e7\u00e3o por micropl\u00e1sticos na superf\u00edcie do mar adjacente \n\naos Arquip\u00e9lagos de Fernando de Noronha, Abrolhos e \u00e0 Ilha da Trindade \n\n? Identificar e caracterizar a polui\u00e7\u00e3o por micropl\u00e1sticos nas praias arenosas dos \n\nArquip\u00e9lagos de Fernando de Noronha, Abrolhos e da Ilha da Trindade \n\n \n\nDurante todo o curso de Doutorado foi realizada uma extensa revis\u00e3o da literatura cient\u00edfica \n\nsobre o tema, sendo acessados mais de centenas de artigos cient\u00edficos, todos publicados em revistas \n\nindexadas com revis\u00e3o por pares. Esta revis\u00e3o representa o Cap\u00edtulo I desta tese de Doutorado, \n\nintitulado \u201cThe present and future of microplastic pollution in the marine environment\u201d. De modo \n\ngeral, estudos relacionados \u00e0 polui\u00e7\u00e3o por micropl\u00e1sticos t\u00eam seu principal foco nos ambientes \n\ncosteiros e oce\u00e2nicos onde eles ocorrem, principalmente (1) na superf\u00edcie do mar; (2) em sedimentos \n\narenosos e lamosos; (3) na sua ingest\u00e3o por organismos invertebrados e vertebrados; (4) nas \n\nintera\u00e7\u00f5es com poluentes qu\u00edmicos e, consequentemente, no seu papel na dispers\u00e3o destes dentro das \n\nteias tr\u00f3ficas e ao redor do globo. A cada dia novas evid\u00eancias reiteram a onipresen\u00e7a das \n\nmicropart\u00edculas pl\u00e1sticas e, at\u00e9 onde se sabe, n\u00e3o existem barreiras f\u00edsicas ou biol\u00f3gicas para estes \n\npoluentes (Ivar do Sul e Costa 2014). Entretanto, muitas outras lacunas ainda precisam ser \n\npreenchidas no que se refere \u00e0 polui\u00e7\u00e3o marinha por micropl\u00e1sticos (Cole et al. 2011, Ivar do Sul e \n\nCosta 2014). O Cap\u00edtulo I deste documento come\u00e7a na p\u00e1gina 6, sendo numerado de acordo com a \n\npagina\u00e7\u00e3o da revista Environmental Pollution (ISSN: 0269-7491), onde encontra-se publicado. \n\n(Environmental Pollution, volume 185, p\u00e1ginas 352-364, 2014). \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nUm dos aspectos em evid\u00eancia na literatura especializada consiste na utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de amostra de \n\npl\u00e2ncton j\u00e1 existentes para a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o da polui\u00e7\u00e3o por micropl\u00e1sticos, principalmente em \u00e1reas \n\noce\u00e2nicas onde o acesso \u00e9 restrito e as amostragens s\u00e3o dispendiosas (Arthur et al. 2009). O uso \n\ndestes \u201cbancos de amostras\u201d preexistentes j\u00e1 tinha sido realizado com sucesso em estudos de larga \n\nescala no oceano Atl\u00e2ntico Norte (Thompson et al. 2004; Law et al. 2010; Mor\u00e9t-Ferguson et al. \n\n2010) e foi novamente utilizado nesta tese de Doutorado. Amostras de pl\u00e2ncton coletadas no \n\nArquip\u00e9lago de S\u00e3o Pedro e S\u00e3o Paulo (0\u00b055\u2019N, 29\u00b020\u2019W) foram reanalisadas para identificar e \n\ncaracterizar a polui\u00e7\u00e3o por micropl\u00e1sticos neste arquip\u00e9lago que \u00e9 um dos mais remotos do Oceano \n\nAtl\u00e2ntico. Os resultados destes esfor\u00e7os representam o Cap\u00edtulo II desta tese, intitulado \u201cPelagic \n\nmicroplastics around an archipelago of the Equatorial Atlantic\u201d. O uso de amostras preexistentes \n\nmostrou-se novamente eficiente na identifica\u00e7\u00e3o de micropl\u00e1sticos, al\u00e9m de representar uma \n\nimportante oportunidade para acertar os passos metodol\u00f3gicos para a coleta, manipula\u00e7\u00e3o e an\u00e1lise \n\ndas amostras da tese. Este artigo foi apresentado e aprovado em agosto de 2012 como exame de \n\nQualifica\u00e7\u00e3o, um dos pr\u00e9-requisitos para a obten\u00e7\u00e3o do t\u00edtulo de Doutor em Oceanografia. O \n\nCap\u00edtulo II deste documento come\u00e7a na p\u00e1gina 7, sendo numerado de acordo com a pagina\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nrevista Marine Pollution Bulletin (ISSN: 0025-326X), onde encontra-se publicado (Marine Pollution \n\nBulletin, volume 75, p\u00e1ginas 305-309, 2013).  \n\nA revis\u00e3o da literatura (Ivar do Sul e Costa 2014) tamb\u00e9m guiou a composi\u00e7\u00e3o dos demais \n\ncap\u00edtulos desta tese de Doutorado e os assuntos encontram-se abordados na ordem hist\u00f3rica; \n\nprimeiramente os resultados dos arrastos de pl\u00e2ncton, cujos registros datam do in\u00edcio da d\u00e9cada de \n\n1970 (por exemplo, Buchanan 1971, Carpenter e Smith 1972), seguidos pelos resultados da \n\namostragem de sedimentos nas praias arenosas (por exemplo, Gregory 1977).  \n\nO Cap\u00edtulo III apresenta os resultados dos arrastos de pl\u00e2ncton realizados na superf\u00edcie do \n\nmar, em \u00e1reas adjacentes \u00e0s ilhas estudadas, sob o t\u00edtulo \u201cMicroplastics in the pelagic environment \n\naround oceanic islands of the Western Tropical Atlantic Ocean\u201d. Nos arrastos de pl\u00e2ncton, optou-\n\nse pela rede neust\u00f4nica, que amostra os primeiros cent\u00edmetros da coluna d\u2019\u00e1gua, onde est\u00e3o maioria \n\ndos pl\u00e1sticos flutuantes. A estrutura da rede foi inspirada em um modelo j\u00e1 existente e amplamente \n\nutilizado pela comunidade cient\u00edfica internacional, buscando-se garantir a melhor efici\u00eancia nas \n\ncoletas. Este modelo foi inicialmente desenvolvido pelo Capit\u00e3o Charles Moore, fundador da \n\nFunda\u00e7\u00e3o Algalita (Calif\u00f3rnia, EUA). Foram feitas algumas modifica\u00e7\u00f5es para que a rede fosse \n\ndesmont\u00e1vel, facilitando o manuseio e transporte entre as ilhas pesquisadas. Atualmente, novas \n\ntecnologias foram desenvolvidas e aplicadas \u00e0s redes neust\u00f4nicas, inclusive pelo Cap. Charles \n\nMoore, e encontram-se dispon\u00edveis no mercado. Adicionalmente, sabe-se que os pl\u00e1sticos podem \n\nestar tamb\u00e9m distribu\u00eddos ao longo da coluna d\u2019\u00e1gua, sendo necess\u00e1rio o desenvolvimento de \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nt\u00e9cnicas que permitam a amostragem em diferentes camadas de profundidade. Outra quest\u00e3o que \n\nvem sendo amplamente discutida pela comunidade internacional \u00e9 a propor\u00e7\u00e3o relativa da polui\u00e7\u00e3o \n\npor pl\u00e1sticos em distintas categorias de tamanho, destacando-se os nanopl\u00e1sticos (1000X menores \n\nque os micropl\u00e1sticos). A utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de uma rede tipo bongo, com diferentes tamanhos de malha (ex. \n\n200\u00b5m, 64\u00b5m) poderia contribuir para o esclarecimento desta quest\u00e3o. Estes novos resultados \n\ndemandariam novos procedimentos de coleta e de laborat\u00f3rio para a identifica\u00e7\u00e3o e manuseio dos \n\nmicropl\u00e1sticos amostrados. Quanto menor o tamanho dos pl\u00e1sticos estudados, maior a necessidade \n\nde cuidados com a poss\u00edvel contamina\u00e7\u00e3o das amostras, tanto em campo (fragmentos da rede \n\nutilizada durante as coletas, por exemplo) quanto em laborat\u00f3rio, atrav\u00e9s do ar, das roupas e \n\ninstrumentos de laborat\u00f3rio, durante os procedimentos anal\u00edticos. O Cap\u00edtulo III deste documento \n\ncome\u00e7a na p\u00e1gina 8, recebendo a numera\u00e7\u00e3o de acordo com a pagina\u00e7\u00e3o da revista Water, Air and \n\nSoil Pollution (ISSN: 0049-6979), onde encontra-se publicado (Water, Air and Soil Pollution, \n\nvolume 225, p\u00e1ginas 1-13, 2013). \n\nO Cap\u00edtulo IV apresenta os resultados da amostragem de sedimento nas praias arenosas de \n\ncada uma das ilhas estudadas, sob o t\u00edtulo \u201cOcurrence and characteristics of microplastics on \n\ninsular beaches in the western tropical Atlantic Ocean\u201d. Na amostragem do sedimento, a literatura \n\napresenta diversos m\u00e9todos de coleta e tratamentos de dados, havendo assim, a urgente necessidade \n\nde padroniza\u00e7\u00e3o destas metodologias. Em geral, a amostragem de quadrantes que foi utilizada neste \n\nestudo vem sendo empregada em praias arenosas na determina\u00e7\u00e3o da polui\u00e7\u00e3o por micropl\u00e1sticos em \n\nescala de mm (1-5mm).

Field and laboratory work regularly provide new evidence on the fate of microplastic\ndebris. This debris has been observed within every marine habitat. In this study, at least 101 peer-\nreviewed papers investigating microplastic pollution were critically analysed (Supplementary\nmaterial). Microplastics are commonly studied in relation to (1) plankton samples, (2) sandy and\nmuddy sediments, (3) vertebrate and invertebrate ingestion, and (4) chemical pollutant interactions. All\nof the marine organism groups are at an eminent risk of interacting with microplastics according to the\navailable literature. Dozens of works on other relevant issues (i.e., polymer decay at sea, new sampling\nand laboratory methods, emerging sources, externalities) were also analysed and discussed. This paper\nprovides the first in-depth exploration of the effects of microplastics on the marine environment and\nbiota. The number of scientific publications will increase in response to present and projected plastic\nuses and discard patterns. Therefore, new themes and important approaches for future work are\nproposed.\n\n? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction\n\nIn 1972, E. J. Carpenter and K. L. Smith became the first re-\nsearchers to sound the alarm on the presence of plastic pellets on\nthe surface of the North Atlantic Ocean. In their publication in\nScience, they stated: \u201cThe increasing production of plastic, combined\nwith present waste-disposal practices, will probably lead to greater\nconcentrations on the sea surface. At present, the only known bio-\nlogical effect of these particles is that they act as a surface for the\ngrowth of hydroids, diatoms, and probably bacteria\u201d. Not surprisingly,\nonly months later, the ingestion of those same polyethylene pellets\nby fish was reported (Carpenter et al., 1972). The prediction by\nCarpenter and Smith (1972) is the focus of the scientific community\nthat is studying the smallest plastic debris pollution sizes (Moore,\n2008; Barnes et al., 2009; Thompson et al., 2009; Ryan et al.,\n2009; Andrady, 2011). Several million tonnes of plastics have\nbeen produced since the middle of the last century (more than two\nhundred million tonnes annually) (Barnes et al., 2009; Thompson\net al., 2009; Andrady, 2011). Speculation exists over how much of\nSul).\n\nAll rights reserved.\nthis plastic will end up in the ocean, where it suffers degradation\nand fragmentation (Barnes et al., 2009; Andrady, 2011). In the\nenvironment, microplastic debris (<5 mm) proliferates, migrates\nand accumulates in natural habitats from pole to pole and from the\nocean surface to the seabed; the debris is also deposited on urban\nbeaches and pristine sediments (Moore, 2008; Barnes et al., 2009;\nThompson et al., 2009; Ryan et al., 2009). This type of pollution is\nubiquitous and persistent in the world\u2019s oceans and openly\nthreatens marine biota.\n\nPlastic means \u201cmalleable\u201d or \u201cflexible\u201d. Indeed, these synthetic\nmaterials can be moulded into virtually any shape (Moore, 2008).\nPlastics are versatile materials that are inexpensive, lightweight,\nstrong, durable and corrosion-resistant. They have high thermal\nand electrical insulation values (Thompson et al., 2009) and are\nincredibly practical. Plastics are formed by long chains of polymeric\nmolecules that are created from organic and inorganic raw mate-\nrials, such as carbon, silicon, hydrogen, oxygen and chloride; these\nmaterials are usually obtained from oil, coal and natural gas (Shah\net al., 2008). Currently, the most widely used synthetic plastics are\nlow- and high-density polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP),\npolyvinyl chloride (PVC), polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene tere-\nphthalate (PET). Altogether, these plastics represent w90% of the\ntotal world production (Andrady and Neal, 2009). Thus, it is widely\n\nDelta:1_given name\nDelta:1_surname\nmailto:julianasul@gmail.com\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2013.10.036&amp;domain=pdf\nwww.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/02697491\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/envpol\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2013.10.036\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2013.10.036\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2013.10.036\n\n\nJ.A. Ivar do Sul, M.F. Costa / Environmental Pollution 185 (2014) 352e364 353\naccepted that the majority of the items polluting coastal and ma-\nrine environments are comprised of these materials (Andrady,\n2011; Engler, 2012).\n\nMost synthetic polymers are buoyant in water (e.g., PE and PP).\nConsequently, substantial quantities of plastic debris that are\nbuoyant enough to float in seawater are transported and eventually\nwashed ashore (Thompson et al., 2009; Andrady, 2011; Engler,\n2012). The polymers that are denser than seawater (e.g., PVC)\ntend to settle near the point where they entered the environment;\nhowever, they can still be transported by underlying currents\n(Engler, 2012). Additionally, microbial films rapidly develop on\nsubmerged plastics and change their physicochemical properties\n(i.e., surface hydrophobicity and buoyancy) (Lobelle and Cunliffe,\n2011). If these fragments sink, then the seabed becomes the ulti-\nmate repository for the plastics (including those that were initially\nbuoyant) (Barnes et al., 2009).\n\nPolymers are rarely used as pure substances. Typically, resins are\nmixed with additives to enhance their performance (Andrady and\nNeal, 2009; Teuten et al., 2009). Considerable controversy exists\nover the extent to which additives that are released from plastic\nproducts (e.g., phthalates and bisphenol A) adversely affect animals\nand humans (Andrady and Neal, 2009; Thompson et al., 2009;\nTeuten et al., 2009; Lithner et al., 2009, 2011). More information\nis available from Thompson et al. (2009) and Cole et al. (2011),\namong others.\n\nAdditionally, the hydrophobic pollutants available in seawater\nmay adsorb onto plastic debris in ordinary environmental condi-\ntions (Thompson et al., 2009; Cole et al., 2011). The majority of\nthese pollutants are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic; thus,\nthey are of particular concern for human and environmental health\n(Engler, 2012). Plastics not only have the potential to transport\ncontaminants, but they can also increase their environmental\npersistence (Teuten et al., 2009). This highlights the importance of\nplastic as vehicles of pollutants to marine biota and humans\n(Teuten et al., 2009; Tanaka et al., 2013).\n\nSmall plastics enter the environment directly, whereas larger\nitems are continuously fragmenting (Barnes et al., 2009). Primary-\nsourced microplastics (Arthur et al., 2009) are directly released to\nthe environment in the form of small (mm) pellets that are used as\nabrasives in industrial (shot blasting) (Gregory, 1996) and domestic\napplications (e.g., Fendall and Sewell, 2009); theycan also be released\nby spilling virgin plastic pellets (mm) (Thompson et al., 2009). Facial\ncleansers that are used by millions of people, especially in developed\ncountries, contain PS particles (mm) that directly enter sewage sys-\ntems and adjacent coastal environments (Zitko and Hanlon, 1991;\nGregory, 1996; Fendall and Sewell, 2009). Moreover, laboratory ex-\nperiments using Sphaeroma quoianun indicated that isopods can\nproduce millions of PS fragments, which resemble plastic pellets,\nwhen incrusted in buoys in the Pacific Ocean (Davidson, 2012).\n\nLarger plastics eventually undergo some form of degradation\nand subsequent fragmentation, which leads to the formation of\nsmall pieces (Shah et al., 2008; Costa et al., 2010; Andrady, 2011).\nDegradation is a chemical change that reduces the average mo-\nlecular weight of polymers (Andrady, 2011). The most-used poly-\nmer types (i.e., PE and PP) have high molecular weights and are\nnon-biodegradable (Shah et al., 2008). However, once in the ma-\nrine environment, they start to suffer photo-oxidative degradation\nby UV solar radiation, followed by thermal and/or chemical\ndegradation. This renders plastics susceptible to further microbial\naction (i.e., biodegradation) (Shah et al., 2008; Andrady, 2011). The\nlight-induced oxidation is orders of magnitude higher than other\ntypes of degradation (Andrady, 2011). Any significant extent of\ndegradation inevitably weakens the plastic, and the material\nbecome brittle enough to fall apart into powdery fragments\n(Andrady, 2011) when subjected to sea motion. This process\nessentially occurs forever (Barnes et al., 2009), including on the\nmolecular level (Andrady, 2011).\n\nReports of plastics have spread rapidly in terms of geography,\nmarine habitat and biota influenced (Barnes et al., 2009; Ryan et al.,\n2009). It was hypothesised that microplastics accumulate in the\ncentres of subtropical gyres, but their means of movement and\ntransport in the sea are largely unknown (Hidalgo-Ruz et al., 2012),\nespecially along the vertical axis. Environmental microplastics are\navailable to every level of the food web, from primary producers\n(Oliveira et al., 2012) to higher trophic-level organisms (Wright\net al., 2013). Individuals who ingest microplastics may suffer\nphysical harm, such as internal abrasion and blockage. Impacts at\nthe population-level are also possible, but largely unknown\n(Wright et al., 2013). Plastic pellets are also used as ovipositon sites\nby insects, such as Halobates micans and H. sericeus, which can\naffect their abundance and dispersion (Majer et al., 2012; Goldstein\net al., 2012). In the western Atlantic, 24% of the pellets (N > 1000)\nhad eggs attached to their surface, most with viable embryos. In the\nNorth Pacific Ocean, the numbers of adults, juveniles and eggs\n(H. sericeus) were significantly correlated with microplastic abun-\ndance. Although it is still risky to conclude the magnitude of this\nproblem (i.e., transport of fouling species), it is fair to consider\nplastics as potential vectors that transport species to previously\nunknown mobility levels (Barnes et al., 2009).\n\nAs predicted (e.g., Carpenter et al., 1972), microplastic pollution\nbecamewidespread with significant implications for ecosystems and\norganisms in a variety of forms. Supporting evidence has been pub-\nlished in peer-reviewed journals from the 1971 benchmark paper by\nBuchanan (1971) to the present. In this context, the present work\naims to sort, critically analyse, and synthesise the recent literature\nregarding microplastics at sea, as well as highlight the risks to and\neffects on the marine biota. The Arthur et al. (2009) definition of\nmicroplastics was adopted (fragments and primary-sourced plastics\nthat are smaller than 5 mm) as the main criteria for discerning a\nspecific size class of plastic pollution. A periodic criticalassessmentof\nthis issue is essential, especially because the problem is mounting\nand will persist for centuries, even if pollution is immediately\nstopped (Barnes et al., 2009).\n\n2. Results\n\nResults from the scientific literature were classified according to\nthe main focus of each work: (1) the presence of microplastics in\nplankton samples; (2) the presence of microplastics in sandy and\nmuddy sediments; (3) the ingestion of microplastics by vertebrates\nand invertebrates; (4) microplastics\u2019 interactions with chemical\npollutants (see the supplementary content in Tables S1, S2, S3, S4\nand S5). Papers in each category were analysed for their most\nrelevant findings to improve and advance discussions on micro-\nplastics at sea.\n\nOne hundred and one documents from various sources fulfilled\nthe review criteria (Table 1). Two works were included in more than\none category: Carpenter et al. (1972) and Thompson et al. (2004).\nFourteen literature reviews, from 2008 to 2013, on microplastics in\nthe marine environment were also consulted. Research related to\nthe development of new sampling or laboratory methods and/or\nanalytical procedures, the (bio)degradation of plastics and other\nrelevant issues were used when appropriated. Approximately 80%\nof the articles were published in the last 15 years, and more than\n60% of the articles were published in the last 5 years.\n\n2.1.

Ivar do Sul, M.F. Costa / Environmental Pollution 185 (2014) 352e364354\nplastics is well-established (Carpenter and Smith, 1972; Carpenter\net al., 1972; Morris and Hamilton, 1974; Wilber, 1987; Ryan, 1988)\n(Table S1). While sampling the pelagic sargassum community in\nthe early 1970s, Carpenter and his team observed high quantities of\npolystyrene plastic pellets (1e2 mm) on the sea surface of the\nwestern North Atlantic Ocean. Most pellets had hydroids and di-\natoms attached to their surfaces (Carpenter and Smith, 1972). Pre-\nviously, the only evidence of synthetic microplastic fibres were\nreported in membrane-filtered water samples from the North Sea\n(Buchanan, 1971). Archived plankton samples from the North\nAtlantic Ocean, which are regularly obtained with a continuous\nplankton recorder (CPR) between Aberdeen and the Shetlands and\nfrom Sule Skerry to Iceland, also revealed the presence of micro-\nplastics in the 1960s (Thompson et al., 2004). Furthermore, these\nsamples indicated a significant increase in the abundance of\nmicroplastics (mainly fibrous and 20 mm in length) during the\n1960e1970s and 1980e1990s (Thompson et al., 2004).\n\nIn the western North Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, a wide-\nrange ship-survey dataset (w6100 tows) also reported the quan-\ntities and characteristics of pelagic plastics (Law et al., 2010). Plastic\nfragments, 88% of which were smaller than 10 mm, were sampled\nbetween 22 and 38?N. This finding reflects the presence of a large-\nscale subtropical convergence zone. Chemical analysis revealed\nthat 99% of the particles were less dense than seawater: high- and\nlow-density PE, PP (Law et al., 2010) and plastic pellets. Using a\nsubset of these samples (Law et al., 2010), Kukulka et al. (2012)\ndeveloped a theoretical model that indicates that the plastics ob-\ntained from surface tows are dependent on wind speed (i.e., tows in\nhigh wind conditions tend to capture fewer plastic pieces) because\nplastics are vertically distributed in the mixed layer due to wind\n(Kukulka et al., 2012). Around the Saint Peter and Saint Paul ar-\nchipelago in the equatorial Atlantic Ocean, plastic fragments\n(N \u00bc 71; w85% smaller than 5 mm) were retained near the\nseamount, as well as reef fish and semi-terrestrial decapod larvae\n(Ivar do Sul et al., 2013). Despite its isolation, the archipelago is not\nfree of autochthonous and allochthonous sources of plastics, which\nmay be ingested by the biota.\n\nIn the North Atlantic Ocean (11e44?N, 55e71?W), more than\n18,000 archived surface net tows were analysed, which allowed\nresearchers to investigate the spatial and temporal trends (1991e\n2007), as well as the visual characteristics, of pelagic microplastics\n(Mor\u00e9t-Ferguson et al., 2010). Sixty per cent of the fragments were\n2e6 mm. Apparently, the densities (g ml?1) of the plastic pellets\ndecreased, but the quantities of the fragments increased 18% over\nthe time period (Mor\u00e9t-Ferguson et al., 2010). The microplastics\nwere sampled significantly higher at 30?N, the subtropical\nconvergence zone. Furthermore, neustonic samples collected in the\nMediterranean Sea indicated that the closed basin is also threat-\nened by microplastic pollution (Collignon et al., 2012). Ninety per\ncent (N \u00bc 40) of the samples contained plastics (0.3e5 mm), which\nwere mostly fibres, PS fragments and films. The microplastic con-\ncentrations were 5 times higher before a strong wind event than\nafter the event. Researchers suggested that wind stress might\nredistribute plastics in the upper layers of the water column and\nprevent them from being sampled by the surface tows (Collignon\net al., 2012). Recently, the occurrence of suspended plastic pellets\nand fibres was reported in the Jade System of the southern North\nSea. The pellets were associated with a paper recycling plant,\nwhereas the fibres were most likely sewage-related (Dubaish and\nLiebezeit, 2013).\n\nIn the Pacific Ocean, plankton tows performed in the 1980s\nrevealed high amounts of coloured microplastic fragments (Shaw\nand Day, 1994). The North Pacific Central Gyre (NPCG) was sampled\nfor the first time at the turn of the XXIst Century (Moore et al., 2001).\nThe surface tows collected plastic fragments, thin films and mono-\nfilament lines, the majority of which were smaller than 5 mm. A large\nplastic to plankton ratio was reported. However, the NPCG is not an\narea of high biological productivity, and the extrapolation of these\nfindings to other oceanic areas is somewhat limited.\n\nSurface plankton tows were carried out in southern California\u2019s\ncoastal waters (Moore et al., 2002). Higher quantities of plastics\n(mainly small fragments) were sampled after a storm event, which\nresulted in a high plastic to plankton ratio (Moore et al., 2002).\nPlastics were also sampled throughout the water column (surface,\nmiddle and bottom) in Santa Monica Bay, California, before and\nafter a storm (Lattin et al., 2004). Unexpectedly, the densities of the\nplastics were not the highest at the surface, but instead were the\nhighest near the bottom. Higher amounts were sampled after a\nstorm, especially close to the shore, which reflects the inputs from\nland-based runoff and re-suspended sediments (Lattin et al., 2004).\nIn another study, microplastics were collected on the surface, rather\nthan at subsurface layers, of the North Pacific Ocean (the Bering Sea\nand off the coast of southern California). The authors emphasise\nthat microplastics (fragments, fishing lines/fibres and virgin plastic\npellets) were concentrated near the surface due to their buoyancy\nin seawater (Doyle et al., 2011).\n\nIn the western Pacific Ocean, particularly in the Kuroshio Cur-\nrent (30e34?N, 133e139?W), plastic and PS fragments were\n\n\n\nJ.A. Ivar do Sul, M.F. Costa / Environmental Pollution 185 (2014) 352e364 355\nidentified in surface plankton tows (Yamashita and Tanimura,\n2007). Seventy-two per cent of the sampled stations contained\nfragments, many of which measured w3 mm. Plastic pellets rep-\nresented&lt;1% of the total sampled items. The surface microlayers\n(50e60 mm) and subsurface layers (1 m) around Singapore were\nalso reported to be contaminated by PE, PP and PS microplastics (Ng\nand Obbard, 2006).\n\nThe Southern Hemisphere is likely contaminated by floating\nplastic debris, as predicted by a recent mathematical computational\nmodel (Maximenko et al., 2012). Based on these findings, Eriksen\net al. (2013) conducted a specific surface survey in the South Pa-\ncific Subtropical Gyre (SPSG), where 96% of the samples revealed\nthe presence of plastics. The majority of the plastics (88.8% of the\ntotal weight) were microplastic fragments (1e5 mm) that were\ncollected between 97 and 111?W. The total amount of sampled\nplastics was lower than that in the NPCG (Moore et al., 2001), but\nboth gyres contained similar sized fragments. A possible inverse\nrelationship exists between plastic counts (or weight) and the sea\nconditions (Kukulka et al., 2012; Collignon et al., 2012).\n\n2.2. Sandy and muddy sediments\n\nMicroplastics on sandy beaches were first reported in the form\nof plastic pellets in New Zealand, Canada, Bermuda and Lebanon\n(Gregory,1977,1978,1983; Shiber,1979) (Table S2). In New Zealand,\nthe pellets were translucent, 2e5 mm in size and related to acci-\ndental spillages at the major ports (Gregory, 1977, 1978). These\ncharacteristics were also observed for PE pellets sampled on bea-\nches in Canada, Bermuda and Lebanon. Many of the pellets showed\ndeterioration due to weathering (Gregory, 1983). Plastic pellets\nhave also been reported on beaches at the Gulf of Oman, the\nArabian Gulf (Khordagui and Abu-Hilal,1994) and the Maltese coast\nof the Central Mediterranean (Turner and Holmes, 2011). On the\nArabian coast, large numbers of stranded pellets and the presence\nof entire bags indicated that a massive spill most likely occurred\nduring shipping. Some of the PE pellets observed in the Mediter-\nranean were embedded in tar. Recently, Fotopoulou and\nKarapanagioti (2012) investigated the superficial characteristics of\nplastic pellets; they revealed that the surfaces of virgin pellets are\nsmooth and uniform, whereas the surfaces of stranded and eroded\nPS and PP pellets are rough and uneven. The PS pellets found in the\nenvironment had enlarged surface areas and were more polar,\nwhich indicates that they more efficiently interact with a variety\nchemical compounds compared with virgin pellets (Fotopoulou\nand Karapanagioti, 2012).\n\nIt seems that plastic resin pellets were already distributed\nworldwide in the 1970s (Hidalgo-Ruz et al., 2012). Nowadays, other\ntypes of microplastics are also reported globally (Browne et al.,\n2011). Microplastics are reportedly present on six continents, and\nhigher amounts are commonly related to densely populated areas.\nIn a study of the types (mostly fibres) and materials (frequently\npolyester and acrylic) of microplastics, Browne et al. (2011) sug-\ngested that the plastics were produced by sewage effluents,\nincluding wastewater from washing machines.\n\nBy analysing sediments from 18 beaches around the UK,\nThompson et al. (2004) most often observed polymers in the form\nof fibres. Microplastics (<1 mm) were also present in sediment\nsamples from the Tamar Estuary, UK (Browne et al., 2010). PVC,\npolyester and polyamide comprised w80% of the total sampled\nfragments and were generally more common at downwind sites.\n\nOn the Belgium coast, the sediment from beaches, harbours and\nsub-littoral habitats were found to be contaminated with micro-\nplastics (38 mme1 mm). In general, plastic fibres were more com-\nmon than pellets, except in harbour areas (Claessens et al., 2011).\nThe sediment cores from sandy beaches revealed that microplastic\ndeposition tripled over the last 20 years (Claessens et al., 2011). In\nthe North Sea, microplastics were quantified on beach and tidal flat\nhabitats on the East Frisian Islands (Liebezeit and Dubaish, 2012).\nPellets (<100 mm) and fibres were present, but plastic fragments\nand PS pellets were completely absent. The tidal flats were more\ncontaminated, mostly by pellets, than the sandy beaches.\n\nAt the Lagoon of Venice, Italy (Vianello et al., 2013), 10 different\npolymers that measured 30e500 mm were successfully identified\nby mFT-IR (Harrison et al., 2012). PS and PP were prevalent. Spatially,\nmicroplastic particles tend to accumulate in low hydrodynamism\nsites (such as the inner lagoon) in a similar manner to fine sediment\nfractions (Vianello et al., 2013).\n\nThe presence of small-sized plastics on Hawaiian beaches is\nexpected because the archipelago is located in the NPCG. All of the\nsediment samples from the islands were contaminated, primarily\nby plastic fragments (87%) but also by resin pellets (11%)\n(McDermid and McMullen, 2004). The strand line was significantly\nmore contaminated when compared to the berm. The samples\nmeasured 2.8e5 mm; however, on remote beaches, such as Cargo\nBeach in the Midway Atoll, the majority of the sampled plastics\nwere even smaller. Another heavily polluted beach in the Hawaiian\nArchipelago is Kamilo Beach, where plastic fragments mostly occur\n(95%) in the top 15 cm of the sediment cores (Carson et al., 2011).\nArtificial sediment cores were constructed, and they indicated that\nhigher amounts of fragments increase the permeability of the\nsediment and change its maximum temperature, which causes the\nsediments to warm more slowly. This can affect the sex of\ntemperature-determinant organisms, such as sea turtles (e.g., a\nreduction in the number of females) (Carson et al., 2011).\n\nIn the Pacific Ocean (Chile), a volunteer survey revealed that\nmicroplastic fragments (1e4.75 mm) occurred in 90% of the beach\nsamples (N \u00bc 39), including those from Easter Island. There, higher\nabundances of smaller fragments were registered (Hidalgo-Ruz and\nThiel, 2013).\n\nNear the Sea of Japan (Kusui and Noda, 2003), plastic fragments\nand pellets were reported on Japanese beaches. However, plastic\nresin pellets were absent from Russian beaches. The presence of\nburied fragments indicates that surveys might underestimate the\nquantities of stranded microplastics on sandy beaches (Kusui and\nNoda, 2003). In the Indian Ocean, the presence of microplastics and\nother materials in coastal sediments were reported in India (Reddy\net al., 2006) and Singapore (Ng and Obbard, 2006). Polyurethane,\nNylon, PS and polyester were identified in inter-tidal environments\non the western coast of India (Reddy et al., 2006). In Singapore,\nmicroplastics, mostly with secondary sources, were prevalent on\ntourist beaches (east coast) (Ng and Obbard, 2006) (Table S2).\n\nIn the western South Atlantic Ocean, plastic pellets have been\npresent on the continental shores for many years (e.g., Ivar do Sul\nand Costa, 2007). The occurrence of plastic fragments was docu-\nmented over the last three decades, but not systematically. The\nstudies were usually related to macro categories of plastic debris.\nCurrently, the research focuses on microplastic debris (Ivar do Sul\net al., 2009; Costa et al., 2010; Fisner et al., 2013). Microplastics\n(mostly hard fragments) were reported on the beaches of Fernando\nde Noronha Archipelago (3?S, 32?W). Virgin plastic pellets have\nonly been spotted on windward beaches, which highlights their\noceanic origins. Microplastics pose a serious risk to the resident and\nmigrant biota, especially endemic species (Ivar do Sul et al., 2009).\nAt Boa Viagem Beach (8?S), an important tourist destination in the\nregion, primary- and secondary-sourced microplastics were pre-\nsent (Costa et al., 2010). The authors emphasised that beach\ncleaning services cannot target this size category. Thus, the only\nabatement method is to reduce the amount of microplastics that\nenter the marine and coastal environments. New methods and\ntechniques aimed at improving microplastic research and the\n\n\n\nJ.A. Ivar do Sul, M.F. Costa / Environmental Pollution 185 (2014) 352e364356\nstandardisation of sampling protocols are continually being\ndeveloped (e.g., Imhof et al., 2012; Claessens et al., 2011; Harrison\net al., 2012).\n\n2.3. Ingestion of microplastics\n\nThe ingestion of microplastics has been documented for verte-\nbrate and invertebrate marine species (Tables S3 and S4). The in-\nteractions between microplastics and marine vertebrates were\ndiscovered and primarily reported from opportunistic sampling.\nHowever, for invertebrates, the research is somewhat restricted to\ncontrolled laboratory experiments (Table 2).\n\n2.4. Vertebrates\n\nThe ingestion of microplastics by teleost fish was discovered\nmany years ago (Carpenter et al.,1972; Hoss and Settle,1990). In the\nearly 1970s, Carpenter et al. (1972) reported the presence of plastics\n(<5 mm) in larvae and juvenile Pseudopleuronects flounder in the\nNorth Atlantic Ocean. Adults (Morone america and Pronotus evolans)\nwere also found to ingest plastic pellets. Furthermore, controlled\nlaboratory experiments were performed (Hoss and Settle, 1990) in\nwhich six different species of fish in early life stages were fed 100e\n500 mm pellets; all of the fish ingested the microplastics. These\nearly works were the first to detect and report this level of inter-\naction between microplastics and the marine biota.\n\nRecently, concerns over the ingestion of microplastics emerged\nwhen synthetic fragments were found in the gastrointestinal con-\ntent from 35% (N \u00bc 670) of the planktivorous fish in the NPCG\n(Boerger et al., 2010; Table S3). Quantitatively, the average number\nof plastic pieces ingested (1e2.79 mm) increased with the fish size.\nThe colours of the plastics collected in the marine environment\nduring sampling revealed similar percentages to those of the\ningested plastics (Boerger et al., 2010). This similarity may indicate\nthat there is no colour-based selectivity by lantern fish (Mycto-\nphidae) during feeding. Pelagic and demersal fish inhabiting the\ncoastal waters around the UK were also found with synthetic and\nsemi-synthetic plastics from sewage sources in their digestive\ntracts. Thirty-six percent (N \u00bc 504) mostly ingested fibres (68%) and\nmicroplastic fragments (Lusher et al., 2013).\n\nIn the North Pacific, mesopelagic fish (9%; N \u00bc 141), including\nMyctophidae, were also contaminated with microplastic fragments\n(w2.2 mm) and fibres (Davison and Asch, 2011). Lantern fish were\nalso found with plastics in their stomach contents (w40%) at the\nMariana Islands (Philippines Sea). Unlike the NPCG, the Marianna\nIslands are not a hotspot of microplastic debris, which illustrates\nthe magnitude of the problem (Van Noord, 2013).\n\nIt is well-established that estuarine environments around the\nworld are affected by microplastic pollution (Browne et al., 2011),\nand their resident fish are at risk of interacting with this pollutant.\nIn a small estuary in the western South Atlantic Ocean, catfishes\n(Ariidae), estuarine drums (Sciaenidae) and mojarras (Gerreidae)\nhave been reported to have synthetic polymers in their digestive\nTable 2\nThe main differences in the ingestion of microplastics between vertebrate and\ninvertebrate marine species based on the retrieved literature (N \u00bc 37 works). See the\nSupplementary content for details.\n\nGroup Type of study Number of organisms\nexamined\n\nPlastic size range\n\nVertebrates Field campaigns Dozens to hundreds w1 mm to several cm\n\nInvertebrates Controlled\nlaboratory\nexperiments\n\nUnits to dozens Few mm to few mm\ntracts (Possatto et al., 2011; Dantas et al., 2012; Ramos et al., 2012;\nTable S3). All of the studied species are benthophagous, which feed\non or just below the sediment surface. These species most\nfrequently ingest blue nylon threads. For catfishes (N \u00bc 182), the\ningestion of plastic debris appeared to vary according to the onto-\ngenetic phase (except for Cathorops agassizii) (Possatto et al., 2011).\nApproximately 8% (N \u00bc 569) of the estuarine drums (adults)\ningested plastic threads during the late rainy season and in the\nmiddle estuary, when higher water fluxes and intense fishery ac-\ntivities occurred (Dantas et al., 2012). Among mojarras, 13.4%\n(N \u00bc 425) were contaminated with synthetic threads. The sources\nof microplastics are related to the ingestion of contaminated prey\n(e.g., polychaetes), the ingestion of threads during normal suction\nfeeding, and the active ingestion of plastics with biofilm. The\npossible transference of the plastics to the species predators at\nhigher trophic-levels in the estuarine and coastal food webs was\nhighlighted (Ramos et al., 2012).\n\nSeabirds have long been known to interact with marine plastic\npollution and have been used to monitor the quantities and\ncomposition of plastic ingestion for at least four decades (e.g., Day\net al., 1984; Fry et al., 1987; Van Franeker and Bell, 1988; Barnes\net al., 2009; Colabuono et al., 2009, 2010). The majority of the\ningested fragments were identified by the naked eye, and macro-\nplastics (>5 mm) and microplastics are commonly reported\ntogether. Plastic pellets were identified in migratory petrels,\nshearwaters and prions in the 1980s and 2000s in the Atlantic and\nsouth-western Indian oceans (Ryan, 2008). Surprisingly, the pro-\nportion of pellets decreased significantly in all five species that\nwere investigated over the last 20 years. However, because the total\nloads of ingested plastics did not vary significantly between de-\ncades, the author attributed this change to the enhancement of\nsecondary-sourced plastics (i.e., fragments) (Ryan, 2008).\n\nPlastic fragments and pellets were identified in two Fulmarus\nglacialis colonies in the Canadian Arctic. More than 80% of the ful-\nmars ingested fragments (Provencher et al., 2009). This species was\nmonitored in several regions in the North Sea and the Netherlands\nfor at least three decades (Table S3). As previously observed by Ryan\n(2008), the industrial plastic pellets found in stomachs decreased\nby half over 20 years, but the plastic fragments tripled (Van\nFraneker et al., 2011). An important finding is that juveniles ate\nmore plastics than adults (K\u00fchn and van Franeker, 2012) and that\nhigher quantities of ingested plastics were reported near highly\nindustrialised areas directly related to fishing and shipping (Van\nFraneker et al., 2011). Further north in Iceland, Fulmarus glacialis\nwere contaminated (K\u00fchn and van Franeker, 2012). Fragmented\nplastics were much more common than virgin plastic pellets, which\nillustrates the wide-ranging distribution of these pollutants (K\u00fchn\nand van Franeker, 2012). However, the percentage of contaminated\nbirds (79%, N \u00bc 58) was low compared to that of birds inhabiting\nlower latitudes, most likely because more fragments are available.\nThis hypothesis was previously suggested by Provencher et al.\n(2010) when they were studying Uria lomvia in Nunavut, Canada.\nThere,11% (N \u00bc 186) of the murres ingested plastic fragments, some\nof which were too small to be identified by the naked eye. The\nauthors emphasised that because murres feed below the sea sur-\nface, they are not likely to ingest floating plastics. Nonetheless, the\nmagnitude of plastic pollution in the marine environment is still a\nconcern (Provencher et al., 2010). Fulmars throughout the eastern\nNorth Pacific Ocean are also highly susceptible to plastics (Avery-\nGomm et al., 2012). More than 90% of samples were found to be\ncontaminated by microplastics, mostly fragments.\n\nAt the Canary Islands, eastern North Atlantic Ocean, fledgling\ncory shearwaters (Calonectris diomedea) contained plastics (83.5%,\nN \u00bc 85) in their guts. Because these chicks never feed in the marine\nenvironment, the plastics were certainly regurgitated during\n\n\n\nJ.A. Ivar do Sul, M.F. Costa / Environmental Pollution 185 (2014) 352e364 357\nparental feeding (Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2012). Ingested items (nylon\nthreads) were directly related to commercial fishery activities\nbecause the Canary Islands are one of the most important fishery\ngrounds in the world. Along the United States east coast, boluses\n(N \u00bc 589) from Larus glaucescens were collected from an environ-\nmentally protected area to study plastics consumption. Twelve per\ncent of the boluses were identified as contaminated, mostly by films\n(<1 cm) derived from supermarket plastic bags (Lindborg et al.,\n2012). In the North Pacific Ocean, albatrosses obtained as by-catch\nfrom fisheries near the Hawaiian Islands were also contaminated.\nPhoebastria immutabilis (N \u00bc 18; 83.3%) had a higher frequency of\ningested plastic than P. nigripes (N \u00bc 29; 52%). Ordinary plastic\nfragments and fishing lines comprised the majority of the ingested\nitems (Gray et al., 2012). Twenty seabirds and other aquatic bird\nspecies that were sampled between British Columbia, Canada, and\nWashington contained low contamination rates. Among the com-\nmon murres, for example, only 2.7% were found with ingested\nplastics. However, many species had small samples, so definitive\nconclusions could not be drawn (Avery-Gomm et al., 2013).\n\nThe transference of organic pollutants adsorbed onto marine\nplastic fragments to vertebrates via ingestion was detected with\nCalonectris leucomelas and Puffinus tenuirostris (Teuten et al., 2009;\nTanaka et al., 2013). Streaked shearwater chicks were fed with\npellets that were contaminated by significant amounts of PCBs.\nAfter 7 days, the identification of lower chlorinated congeners of\nPCBs, which can be regarded as a sensitive tracer to detect the\ncontribution from plastic-derived PCBs, verified the transference of\nthis contaminant from ingested plastics to the biological tissues of\nthe seabirds (Teuten et al., 2009). Similarly, Tanaka et al. (2013)\nmeasured the concentrations of PBDEs from ingested plastic frag-\nments in the natural prey of birds (fish) and in their adipose tissues.\nTwo PBDEs congeners were not found in their prey, but were\nadsorbed onto the plastics, which indicate the transfer of plastic-\nderived chemicals to the seabird (Tanaka et al., 2013).\n\nFor marine mammals, research related to the ingestion of\nmicroplastics is restricted. By analysing fur seal (Arctocephalus\ntropicalis and A. gazella) scats collected on Macquaire Island,\nEriksson and Burton (2003) identified pellet and plastic fragment\n(2e5 mm) contamination. The authors related the ingested plastics\nto the animal\u2019s prey, Electrona subaspera, which had previously\ningested plastics from seawater (Eriksson and Burton, 2003).\nRecently, scats collected from Phoca vitulina in The Netherlands did\nnot contain microplastics. However, 107 stomachs and 100 in-\ntestines that were analysed were contaminated (11% and 1%,\nrespectively), mostly by sheets and threads (Rebolledo et al., 2013).\nTo our knowledge, only a single study investigated the impacts of\nmicroplastics on cetaceans (Fossi et al., 2012). The authors sug-\ngested that fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) ingest microplastics\nbecause of the concentration of phthalates in their blubber, which\nare linked to the pollutants measured on marine microplastics\nsampled in the same area of the Mediterranean Sea where the\nwhales live and feed (Fossi et al., 2012) (Table S3).\n\n2.5. Invertebrates\n\nAfter identifying plastics in plankton samples and sedimen-\ntary habitats, Thompson et al. (2004) investigated whether in-\nvertebrates ingest microplastics in the environment. The authors\nobserved that amphipods (Orchestia gammarellus), lugworms\n(Arenicola marina) and barnacles (Semibalanus balanoides)\ningested microplastics within a few days of exposure. This was\nthe first of a series of works on the ingestion of microplastics by\nmarine invertebrates (mainly molluscs, crustaceans, annelids\nand echinoderms) using controlled laboratory experiments\n(Table 2).\nAmong the well-established model organisms, Mytilus edulis is\nthe most commonly studied in terms of microplastic ingestion\n(Table S4). These mussels ingested and accumulated microplastics\n(<1 mm) within 12 h of the experiment start time (Browne et al.,\n2008). High quantities of microplastics (mostly&lt;3 mm) were\nfound in the hemolymph until the 12th day. Recently, the presence\nof HDPE (?80 mm) in gills and inside the digestive system of\nM. edulis was also investigated (von Moos et al., 2012). The authors\nobserved microplastics in the gills, that were trapped directly from\nthe water column. Microplastics were also in the intestines, which\nsuggests that particles were ingested via ciliar movements and then\ntransferred to this organ (von Moos et al., 2012). Moreover, mussels\ningested even smaller (30 nm) fragments. The experiment results\nindicated that nanoplastics were also ingested by M. edulis, which\ntriggered the production of pseudofeces and reduced their filtering\nactivities (Wegner et al., 2012). The authors emphasised the risks to\nhumans when eating blue mussels. In fact, the transference of\nmicroplastics from M. edulis to higher trophic levels (Carcinus\nmaenas) has already been registered (Farrell and Nelson, 2012).\nMicroplastics can even translocate to the hemolymph and tissues of\nthe crabs. Therefore, the implications are evident for the rest of the\nfood web (Farrell and Nelson, 2012), including for humans (Wegner\net al., 2012). Braid et al. (2012) opportunistically found another\nmollusc, a cephalopod, which has ingested microplastics. Hum-\nboldt squids (Dosidicus gigas), observed during a mass stranding,\ningested pellets and fishing lines (26%; N \u00bc 30). This exemplifies the\ngrowing concern over the accumulation of plastics in the marine\nenvironment (Braid et al., 2012).\n\nAnother animal group that has been studied in terms of\nmicroplastic ingestion is Holothuria (Graham and Thompson,\n2009). Deposit-feeding and suspension-feeding sea cucumbers\nselectively ingest nylon and PVC fragments (0.25e15 mm) over\nsediment grains. Because plastics concomitantly collected in the\nstudy area (USA) were contaminated with organic pollutants, the\ningestion of plastics could initiate a new pathway of PCB exposure\nand cycling within the marine communities (Graham and\nThompson, 2009), which could possibly reach human populations.\n\nStudies concerning microplastic ingestion by benthic crusta-\nceans are limited (Thompson et al., 2004; Murray and Cowie, 2011;\nUgolini et al., 2013). In the Clyde Sea, eighty-three per cent of the\nsampled lobsters (N \u00bc 120) contained microplastics, mainly fila-\nments in the form of balls, in their stomachs (Murray and Cowie,\n2011). A visual analysis revealed that the material of these balls is\nthe same (PP) found on the ropes used by the fishing industry for\ncatching Nephrops. In the laboratory, lobsters also ingested plastic\nseeds in the first 24 h after exposure (Murray and Cowie, 2011).\nTalitrus saltator was found to ingest PE and PP microplastics on\nsandy shores in Pisa (Italy). In the laboratory, experiments\nconfirmed they are able to ingest microplastics when feeding and\nexpel the plastic within one week (Ugolini et al., 2013).\n\nThirteen zooplankton taxa, mainly crustaceans (Copepoda,\nEuphausiacea and Decapoda) and Tunicata, Cnidaria and Mollusca,\ningested microplastics (1.7e30.6 mm) under laboratory conditions\n(Cole et al., 2013). Among copepods, the presence of microplastics\nsignificantly reduced feeding, which illustrates the negative im-\npacts of microplastics on zooplankton communities (Cole et al.,\n2013).\n\nInformation concerning the uptake of microplastics and its im-\nplications for polychaetes also exist (Thompson et al., 2004). In a\nlaboratory experiment, Arenicola marina ingested PS microplastics\n(400e1300 mm); the authors established a positive relationship\nbetween the microplastic concentration in the sediment and the\ningestion of plastics and the weight loss by the lugworm (Besseling\net al., 2013). Feeding activity was also reduced. Despite these\nphysical impacts, the microplastics did not accumulate in their\n\n\n\nJ.A. Ivar do Sul, M.F. Costa / Environmental Pollution 185 (2014) 352e364358\ndigestive tracts during the experiment (28 days). The ingestion of\nPS (small doses) by A. marina was associated with higher concen-\ntrations of PCBs in their tissues (Besseling et al., 2013).\n\n2.6. Adsorption of pollutants onto microplastic particles\n\nPP resin pellets collected along the Japanese coast were enriched\nwith polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorines (DDE) and\nnonylphenols (NP) absorbed from seawater (Mato et al., 2001;\nOgata et al., 2009) (Table S5). The concentrations were compara-\nble to those found in suspended particles and bottom sediments\ncollected in the same area. Plastic additives and/or their degrada-\ntion products were most likely the major source of NP (Mato et al.,\n2001). Individual analysis of PCBs revealed that concentrations are\nhighly variable among individual pellets and locations along the\nJapanese coast (Endo et al., 2005; Ogata et al., 2009). Additionally,\ndiscoloured (weathered) pellets generally exhibited higher con-\ncentration of PCBs than coloured pellets.\n\nNear Lisbon, along the Portuguese coast, black, white, coloured\nand aged pellets were analysed separately for PCBs, polycyclic ar-\nomatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and DDTs (Frias et al., 2010). The black\npellets exhibited higher concentrations of PCBs than aged pellets,\npossibly because they have higher adsorption rates (Frias et al.,\n2010). Latitudinal surveys revealed that organic chemical pollut-\nants were present along the entire Portuguese coastline (Ogata\net al., 2009; Mizukawa et al., 2013). The concentrations of PCBs\nadsorbed onto the pellets were one order of magnitude higher\naround the major cities of Porto and Lisbon and were directly\nrelated to industrial and urban discharges. In less-developed cities,\nPCBs are most likely airborne from industrialised areas (Mizukawa\net al., 2013). Similarly, beaches in the Saronikos Gulf near Athens\nhad higher contamination levels (Karapanagioti et al., 2011) than\nother beaches around the world (e.g., Ogata et al., 2009). Organic\ncompounds and metals accumulate on PE plastic pellets in the\ncoastal and marine environments (Ashton et al., 2010).\n\nMicroplastics and associated pollutants were investigated in the\nSouth Atlantic Ocean (Ogata et al., 2009). On South African beaches,\nlong-term surveys of PE pellets indicated that the mean average\nconcentrations of all of the persistent organic pollutants (POPs)\ndecreased from the 1980s to 2000s (Ryan et al., 2012). The con-\ncentrations of these contaminants likely decreased in the South\nAfrican coastal waters as well. In the western Atlantic Ocean, plastic\npellets were systematically sampled as deep as 1 m in the sediment\nof a sandy beach at Santos Bay, which is a long-term and densely\nindustrialised region (Fisner et al., 2013). Higher concentrations of\nP\n\n-total PAHs were found in the surface layer (0e10 cm), whereas\nP\n\n-priority PAHs were found in higher concentrations in the 60e\n70 cm layer. Petrogenic and pyrolytic sources were introduced to\nthe area (Fisner et al., 2013).\n\nLaboratory experiments tested the kinetic distribution of plastic\npellets from different materials (PP, PE, polyoxymethylene (POM)\nand eroded pellets) (Karapanagioti and Klontza, 2008). Phenan-\nthrene adsorption occurs through diffusion onto the plastic pellets\nfor all materials, except for PP. For this material, diffusion is most\nlikely dependent on salinity (more so than for the other materials).\nFor eroded pellets, the distribution coefficient (KdFW \u00bc 1400 L kg?1)\nis higher due to the weathering in the environment, and diffusion\noccurs more slowly (Karapanagioti and Klontza, 2008).\n\nNear the NPCG and California coast, the presence of PCBs, PAHs\nfrom combusted fossil fuels, and DDTs from pesticides was reported\nin plastic pellets and microplastic fragments (80e90% PP) (Rios\net al., 2007). Recently, plankton samples from the same area indi-\ncated that PP fragments were still contaminated by organic pol-\nlutants. Several samples exhibited high concentration levels\n(similar to those from marine sediments), which demonstrates that\nplastics actually adsorb and accumulate pollutants once in the\nmarine environment (Rios et al., 2010).\n\nUsing a thermodynamic approach, Gouin et al. (2011) suggested\nthat hydrophobic organic chemicals will adsorb onto PE plastics if\nthe plastics are available in large quantities and the natural organic\nmatter is limited. In addition, the transport of microplastics may\nenhance the mobility of the hydrophobic compounds that have\nlimited transport potential (Gouin et al., 2011).\n\nTo assess the relationships between mass-produced plastic\npolymers and organic contaminants, Rochman et al. (2013) carried\nout a controlled experiment that exposed PE, PP, PET and PVC\nfragments over a 12-month period to environmental concentra-\ntions of PCBs and PAHs at San Diego Bay, California, where POPs\nwere already known to contaminate beached plastic debris (Van\net al., 2012). The concentrations of PAHs and PCBs that adsorbed\nonto HDPE, LDPE, and PP were consistently greater than those\nadsorbed onto PET and PVC fragments (Rochman et al., 2013). The\nauthors suggested that products made from HDPE, LDPE, and PP\npose a greater risk to marine animals than those products made\nfrom PET and PVC if the fragments are ingested.\n\nThe possible differences amongst the most often used and\nreleased types of plastics (i.e., PE, PP, PVC) have been tested in\nsedimentary habitats. PE, which has larger volumes of the internal\ncavities, adsorbed more phenanthrene than PP and PVC (Teuten\net al., 2007). Again, the authors suggested that microplastics\nwould increase the accumulation of PAHs when ingested by lug-\nworms (A. marina). However, in the environment, chemical com-\npounds normally occur as mixtures, not single solute systems\n(Bakir et al., 2012). In the laboratory, in a bi-solute system with\nphenanthrene and 4,40-DDT, the DDT did not exhibit significantly\ndifferent sorption behaviour (using PE and PVC 200e250 mm) than\nsingle solute systems. However, the DDT did appear to interfere\nwith the sorption of phenanthrene onto plastics, which indicates an\nantagonistic effect (Bakir et al., 2012) (Table S5).\n\n3. Discussion\n\nIt is well-established that plastics will fragment in the marine\nenvironment and form micro and nano pieces (Andrady, 2011);\nhowever, no long-term studies have been undertaken to estimate\nthe actual residence time of these fragments (Roy et al., 2011;\nHidalgo-Ruz et al., 2012). Moreover, if these fragments are not\ncompletely mineralised (i.e., biodegraded) within relatively short\nperiods of time, their potential harmful effects must be addressed\n(Figs. 1 and 2) (Roy et al., 2011). Scientific evidence of the fate and\nconsequences of microplastics rapidly emerged in the literature,\nalthough crucial investigations remain uncompleted or overlooked\n(Fig. 3).\n\nMicroplastics have a larger surface area to volume ratio than\nmacroplastics and are more susceptible to contamination by a\nnumber of airborne pollutants (i.e., manufactured POPs and to\nsome extent, metals) (Table S5). Because plastics are made of highly\nhydrophobic materials, the chemical pollutants are concentrated in\nand/or onto their surfaces, and microplastics act as reservoirs of\ntoxic chemicals in the environment. Plastic pellets have been suc-\ncessfully studied to assess the worldwide quantities of POPs in a\nplatform called the \u201cInternational Pellet Watch\u201d (e.g., Ogata et al.,\n2009). With these data, it was possible to identify geographical\n\u2018hotspots\u2019 (Table S5). More importantly, scientists can continuously\nand systematically monitor contaminated pellets and determine\nthe temporal patterns of various pollutants, which effectively aids\ndecision-makers (Fig. 3). Recently, laboratory studies showed that\nweathering significantly changes the superficial characteristics of\nvirgin plastic pellets. Additionally, coloured plastics and different\ntypes of polymers (i.e., PP and PE) may adsorb POPs from the\n\n\n\nFig. 1.

The crosses represent works that registered microplastics outside of the scale used here.\n\nJ.A. Ivar do Sul, M.F. Costa / Environmental Pollution 185 (2014) 352e364 359\nenvironment differently. These findings must be considered and\nvalidated in future work and monitoring projects (e.g., Frias et al.,\n2010), including in the assessment of microplastic fragments\n(Hirai et al., 2011).\n\nMicroplastics transport pollutants over large oceanic areas (Zarfl\nand Matthies, 2010) and contaminate the marine biota when\ningested (Teuten et al., 2007, 2009; Tanaka et al., 2013). By eating\nthe contaminated microplastics, individuals are susceptible to\nphysical damage and to doses of pollutants that were not previ-\nously accessible in other tangible matrices, such as seawater and\nsediments. Organisms at every level of the marine food web ingest\nmicroplastics (Fig. 2), but those inhabiting industrialised areas are\nexposed to higher amounts and may be more contaminated.\nHowever, the speculated quantities (mg g?1; ng g?1) of contami-\nnants vary significantly among fragments within the same area;\nconsequently, the toxicity of pollutants and incorporation into\nbodily tissues varies for each biological species. Some groups (e.g.,\nholothurians) apparently ingest microplastics with specific colours\nand shapes; if those polymers adsorb higher quantities of pollut-\nants, the consequences are most likely greater. Therefore, popula-\ntion level effects, including the mechanisms to explain the\ntransference of ingested plastics and their adsorbed contaminants\nalong marine food webs, are merely speculative. Primary producers\nare known to incorporate microplastics and organic pollutants\n(Oliveira et al., 2012); therefore, bioaccumulation to top predators,\nincluding larger species (Mysticetidae) (Fossi et al., 2012), or among\nprimary and secondary consumers may occur (Eriksson and Burton,\n2003; Farrell and Nelson, 2012) (Fig. 2).\n\nPotentially, microplastics with low and high densities are\ningested when present in the marine environment (Fig. 2) and tend\nto float on the sea surface. There, they are available to a wide range\nof organisms that may ingest microplastics passively or actively.\nUntil recently, only hypotheses and weak evidence for the ingestion\nprocess were available (e.g., Day et al., 1984; Boerger et al., 2010;\nRamos et al., 2012). If the polymer is denser than the seawater or\nbecomes covered by biological films, then it tends to sink (even-\ntually reaching the seabed) or becomes neutrally buoyant (e.g.,\nLattin et al., 2004).\n\nHigher amounts of buoyant microplastics were reported in the\nNorth Pacific Ocean, particularly the NPCG, than in other ocean\nbasins (Fig. 1). This region is currently referred to as the \u201ceastern\ngarbage path\u201d (Moore et al., 2001, 2002; Lattin et al., 2004; Rios\net al., 2010). Microplastics were mainly related to fishing activ-\nities (oceanic sources) in the gyre, but on the coast, they were\nrelated to continental discharges at highly industrialised low lati-\ntudes. In the North Atlantic Ocean, contamination patterns at the\nsea surface are generally two orders of magnitude lower than in the\nNPCG (Fig. 1). Fibres were prevalent in the North Sea, whereas hard\nplastic fragments were more common in the Caribbean Sea; how-\never, the sampling methods varied between the locations\n(Table S1). The corresponding subtropical gyres in the Southern\nHemisphere were less contaminated, most likely because there are\n\n\n\nFig. 2. A conceptual model of the potential trophic routes of microplastics across marine vertebrate and invertebrate groups. The blue dots are polymers that are less dense than\nseawater (i.e., PE and PP) and the red dots are polymers that are more dense than seawater (i.e., PVC). The dashed arrows represent the hypothesised microplastic transfer.

The 300 mm mesh size is most\ncommonly used to sample microplastics at sea (Hidalgo-Ruz et al.,\n2012). However, additional mesh sizes were also applied, which\nproduce large variations in the quantity of microplastics collected\n(e.g., Cole et al., 2011).\nFig. 3. Various issues regarding microplastic pollution at sea will need the cooperation of d\nfor coastal and marine environments, marine biota and society.\nSurface-feeding petrels, shearwaters and albatrosses, including\nfledgling chicks, appear to be the most impacted by floating\nmicroplastics (up to 90% of samples). Scientific reports are wide-\nspread, from the Antarctic to the Canadian Arctic, and throughout\nall of the ocean basins (Fig. 1 and Table S3). As expected, ingested\namounts of plastics decreased towards the high latitudes; plastic\nifferent stakeholders. The integration of their actions will encourage positive outcomes\n\n\n\nJ.A. Ivar do Sul, M.F. Costa / Environmental Pollution 185 (2014) 352e364 361\nfragments are now prevalent over pellets as observed from the\nlong-term field work in the Atlantic Ocean (e.g., Mor\u00e9t-Ferguson\net al., 2010). Therefore, seabirds can be considered sensitive mon-\nitors of small plastics at sea (Ryan, 2008). Ingested plastics signif-\nicantly vary in size, and studies now need to quantify the\nmagnitude and characteristics of smaller sizes (<1 mm) of micro-\nplastics. Procellariiformes do not regurgitate plastics, which is one\nexplanation for the high amount of plastics observed in their\nstomachs. However, POPs from the microplastics in their digestive\ntracts can eventually enter the bloodstream, reach other organs and\npossibly result in physiologic damage. Seabirds may eat pelagic\nmicroplastics when feeding, but they likely also ingest planktivo-\nrous fish and squids that had previously ingested microplastics\nfrom seawater (similar to the observations of other top predators,\nsuch as fur seals) (Table S3). Likewise, pelagic fish and squids may\ningest microplastics with plankton or ingest them actively (most of\nthe ingestion processes are largely speculative). The extent of the\nproblem is huge; fish (Myctophidae) reported in various geographic\nregions with microplastics comprise more than half of the world\noceans\u2019 total fish biomass. Furthermore, because fish excrete\ningested plastics (Hoss and Settle, 1990), sub-lethal effects are a\nvery likely hypothesis.\n\nThe shores on six continents are contaminated with micro-\nplastics (Fig. 1). Fibres (mm) are prevalent in the eastern North\nAtlantic and the North Sea due to continental effluent discharges.\nMicroplastic fragments and virgin plastic pellets are more common\nwhen the size limitation of their detection is on the order of mil-\nlimetres (i.e., the eastern and western coasts of South America).\nHowever, fibres are most likely also spread throughout these sed-\niments, mostly around urban areas (Browne et al., 2011). Oceanic\nislands were also reportedly contaminated by microplastic frag-\nments. In estuaries, which are potential sources of these contami-\nnants, studies are nearly non-existent. Moreover, the presence of\nmicroplastics in terrestrial ecosystems and the soil are completely\nabsent from the literature (Rillig, 2012). The presence of micro-\nplastics in coastal sediments resulted in unexpected consequences,\nsuch as changes in the physical proprieties of beaches and associ-\nated problems (e.g., Carson et al., 2011).\n\nAdditionally, benthic species ingest microplastics in highly\ndeveloped areas and in small estuarine ecosystems (Fig. 1;\nTable S3). Threads from fisheries (ropes and nets) were positively\nidentified in the digestive tracts of benthic fish and lobsters.\nMicroplastics, and consequently POPs, are possibly remobilised\n(bioturbation) in the sedimentewater interface (Besseling et al.,\n2013). Ingestion events were described for several groups of in-\nvertebrates through laboratory experiments, but there is still a lack\nof research on the ingestion of microplastics by invertebrates in the\nmarine environment, possibly because these studies are time-\nconsuming and require more advanced technology (Table S4).\n\n4. Conclusion and suggestions\n\nWith knowledge comes greater responsibility. Historical and\nrecent findings regarding microplastic pollution in coastal and\nmarine environments, as described by review papers, need to be\ncoalesced to provide guidelines for all stakeholders concerned with\nthe life cycle of plastic. Two major issues are prevalent: how to\nproceed with source control and methods to address the enormous\nenvironmental passives that were built over the last 60 years (since\nplastics became largely expendable) (Fig. 3). Source control has\nbeen preached by every paper, official and un-official document on\nmarine plastics debris for decades. However, technical evidence\nand published opinion have failed to effectively introduce it into\nthe DNA of the plastic production, use and re-use industries. Source\ncontrol has only been a priority for very close and restricted circles\nwhere the 3Rs (or the 5Rs: Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Rethink)\nare the norm rather than the exception. Source control would have\nto integrate and prioritise Rethink (choose other materials and\ntechniques) and Refuse (reduce the production of all single use\nplastic items) into society and the production sectors. Specific ac-\ntions targeted to primary and secondary sources of microplastics\nare required to control pellets and to stop large items from reaching\nthe sea (where they decay). Unfortunately, based on present trends,\nanimals and humans will continue to be at risk and accidents will\noccur before these goals are achieved.\n\nTackling the environmental passives is a different story. Micro-\nplastics cannot be sieved from sands or filtered out of seawater.\nCollecting all of these microparticles would take forever, and even\nso it would not be effective. Microplastics will continue their slow,\nintricate paths towards the bottom of the ocean and ultimately\nbecome buried in sand and mud for centuries. However, rather than\ndespair, scientists should propose solutions that can be considered\nby academia, society and industry. Each group of stakeholders\n(academia, the community, decision-makers and industry) is\nresponsible for various tasks (Fig. 3) including communicating re-\nsults to other stakeholders. Several knowledge gaps need to filled:\nstandardising size definitions; establishing the relative importance\nof primary and secondary sources; rescuing information on pelagic\nplastics that is stored in plankton samples; adding microplastics as\na routine survey variable in river basins and oceans; assessing\nmicroplastic pollution in the Antarctic and Arctic; creating and\ncontinuously improving experimental methods to quantify\nmicroplastics.\n\nApplied research, which is performed by many societal sectors,\nhas the potential to introduce new techniques to assess micro-\nplastics pollution and new materials, designs and facilities that will\nultimately prevent plastics from reaching the environment. Some\nsuggestions include performing laboratory tests on microplastic\ningestion and necropsies for verification of physical harm, ingestion\nof contaminated microplastics (POPs) and confirmation of trans-\nference/damage by histology and chemical characterisation of\npelagic and benthic microplastics to confirm its composition.\n\nThe community, although aware of the problem, must be guided\nby the public sector to search for local alternatives to excessive\npackaging, safely deposit their inevitable plastic rubbish and make\nbetter and more informed choices as consumers. Additionally, in-\ndependent world conferences on microplastics would coalesce\nknowledge and actions, integrate research from countries where\nprimary plastics are produced/exported and help define the tem-\nporal patterns of chemical pollutants (e.g., International Pellets\nWatch).\n\nThese suggestions will require implementation of educational\nprograms, the cooperation of urban and rural facilities and, above\nall, persuasion through practical examples of environments that\neasily and directly exhibit proper control of waste. Decision-\nmakers, mostly in the public sector, have intelligent and techni-\ncally sound regulations to issue in the future, in addition to existing\nissues already enforced. State polices can be formed to direct the\ncontrol of the sources of primary plastics and calculate environ-\nmental value losses (fish stocks, gas exchange, beach erosion) by\nmicroplastic pollution. Additionally, a complete cradle-to-grave\napproach to plastics would reduce the amount that reaches the\nsea and reduce our carbon footprint. Plastics are a branch of the oil\nand gas industry (8% of the oil produced is used in plastic pro-\nduction). Therefore, both sectors must meet to collaborate as soon\nas possible.\n\nIn addition to the petrochemical and plastics moulding units,\nindustry as a whole must be prepared for the need to produce and\nuse less plastic. Fiscal incentives for technologies that resolve\nenvironmental passives need to be established. The intention is not\n\n\n\nJ.A. Ivar do Sul, M.F. Costa / Environmental Pollution 185 (2014) 352e364362\nto face this sector as an arch-enemy, but rather to start a collabo-\nrative process that will steadily progress from controlling pellet\npollution to effectively and dutifully applying reverse logistics to\ntackle the environmental passives caused by plastics on land and at\nsea.\n\nThe outcomes of such rationales are expected to be far-reaching.\nFirst, coastal and marine habitats will regain their lost aesthetic\nvalues, ecological functions and services. Secondly, the risks posed\nto the marine biota will be reduced. Ultimately, these outcomes\nwould create a less plastic-addicted and more nature-centred so-\nciety in which the greatest values, based on science and experience,\nare life and environmental preservation.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe are grateful to the National Council for Scientific and Tech-\nnological Research (CNPq) for the PhD scholarship provided to\nJuliana A.

Such deb-\nris is reported in every habitat of the oceans, from urban tourist beaches to remote islands and from the\nocean surface to submarine canyons, and is found buried and deposited on sandy and cobble beaches.\nPlastic marine debris varies from micrometres to several metres in length and is potentially ingested\nby animals of every level of the marine food web. Here, we show that synthetic polymers are present\nin subsurface plankton samples around Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago in the Equatorial Atlantic\nOcean. To explain the distribution of microplastics around the Archipelago, we proposed a generalised\nlinear model (GLM) that suggests the existence of an outward gradient of mean plastic-particle densities.\nPlastic items can be autochthonous or transported over large oceanic distances. One probable source is\nthe small but persistent fishing fleet using the area.\n\n? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\nPlastics are a complex problem in the marine environment. The\nquantities and consequences of macroplastics in the oceans and\ncoastal habitats have been well documented in the literature for\nat least four decades (e.g., Ivar do Sul and Costa, 2007; Moore,\n2008; Barnes et al., 2009). Presently, the scientific community is fo-\ncused on microplastics (defined as plastics with less than 5 mm), a\nsize fraction much more abundant (Law et al., 2010; Browne et al.,\n2011; Andrady, 2011) and probably most hazardous to marine\norganisms (Eriksson and Burton, 2003; Thompson et al., 2004).\nThe ingestion of microplastics has been documented for verte-\nbrates (Moore, 2008; Boerger et al., 2010) and invertebrates\n(Wright et al., 2013) from every level of the marine food web\nand is very likely to be related to the plastics\u2019 size, shape and col-\nour, although additional studies are needed to clarify these ques-\ntions. Expected consequences of an ingestion event are physical\ninjuries and blockage, but microplastics are alsoefficient in the\ntransport of sorbed organic and inorganic pollutants, which can\ncontaminate animal tissues (Teuten et al., 2009; Tanaka et al.,\n2013).\n\nThe first attempt to quantify floating plastic debris was made in\nthe Western North Atlantic Ocean (Carpenter and Smith, 1972;\nLaw et al., 2010) nearly 40 years ago, but studies have also been re-\nported for the North Pacific Ocean (e.g., Moore et al., 2001) since\nthe turn of the XXIst century. Recently, other oceans were reported\nto also be contaminated by microplastics (e.g., Collignon et al.,\n2012). Therefore, the problem seems to be widespread throughout\nthe ocean basins. However, the appropriate sampling procedures\nare difficult, especially in remote areas, and many years of studies\nwill be needed to characterise the magnitude of microplastic pollu-\ntion. Experts have suggested that floating plastics from archived\nplankton samples should be used to further improve our present\nknowledge (Arthur et al., 2009), revealing information on micro-\nplastic amounts and spatial distributions. This sample re-purpos-\ning has been already done successfully in large-scale studies (i.e.,\nThompson et al., 2004; Law et al., 2010; More?t-Ferguson et al.,\n2010). Following this international trend but focused on a small-\nscale perspective, we examined existing plankton samples from\nthe Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago (0?550N, 29?200W), a re-\nmote oceanic seamount that rises only a few metres above sea le-\nvel on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Fig. 1A).\n\nOur initial hypothesis is that, despite its geographic isolation,\nthis archipelago is not free from pelagic microplastic pollution.\nSearching for microplastics in this remote environment is very dif-\nferent from conducting plankton tows in the centres of subtropical\ngyres, where large, positively buoyant plastics are known to accu-\nmulate, mainly due to surface currents and winds (Moore et al.,\n2001; Moore, 2008; More?t-Ferguson et al., 2010; Maximenko\net al., 2012). In this equatorial region, the mechanisms that drive\nthe local distribution of microplastics around the Saint Peter and\nSaint Paul Archipelago are not known but are probably more influ-\nenced by smaller-scale phenomena (particle aggregation or animal\nactivities) (Hidalgo-Ruz et al., 2012) than by variables acting over\nwhole oceanic basins. In the Archipelago, the prevailing wind-\ndriven current is the northern branch of the oligotrophic South\nEquatorial Current (SEC), which flows westward (Lumpkin and\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2013.07.040\nmailto:julianasul@gmail.com\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2013.07.040\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/0025326X\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/marpolbul\n\n\nFig. 1.

The colours\nare the same as those plotted in Fig.1E. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\n\n306 J.A. Ivar do Sul et al. / Marine Pollution Bulletin 75 (2013) 305\u2013309\nGarzoli, 2005). In addition, the Equatorial Undercurrent (EU) is a\nshallow current (40\u2013150 m depth) derived from the North Brazil\nCurrent, which flows eastward, eventually reaching the sea surface\n(Stramma and Schott, 1999). Both of these currents are parallel to\nthe Equator (Stramma and Schott, 1999; Lumpkin and Garzoli,\n2005).\n\nAround oceanic islands and seamounts, horizontal interactions\nbetween biological and physical mechanisms aggregate and con-\ncentrate plankton (at small scales), frequently enhancing biological\nproduction (Genin, 2004). In this context, initial research around-\nthe Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago intended to test varia-\ntions of zooplankton biomass, abundance and diversity.\nSubsurface (0\u20130.6 m from the surface) plankton tows (5\u201310 min\nat 2 knots) were conducted at three distances from the Archipelago\n(<100 m, 100\u2013500 m and 500\u20131500 m) in April, August and\nNovember 2003 and in March 2004. Samples were collected with\na conical\u2013cylindrical plankton net (0.6 m mouth diameter), with\n300 lm mesh size and 2 m length, equipped with a flowmeter.\nThe samples were fixed (4% formalin) before storage.\n\nFor plastic surveys, these archived plankton samples were fil-\ntered through a 0.45 lm filter and freeze-dried. The dried material\nwas weighed and observed under a stereomicroscope (5?). Plastic\nitems were separated and classified regarding their appearance,\nshape, size and colour.\n\nThe dry material present in the samples was composed almost\nexclusively of zooplankton. From the 88 horizontal subsurface\ntows, 41% contained at least one, and a maximum of eight, micro-\nplastics. A total of 71 individual items were recognised and were\nclassified according to their shape as hard fragments, threads and\nrubber crumbs (Figs. 1B and 2). The total mean density was\napproximately 1 item per 100 m3 of seawater. All the microplastics\nderived from the breakdown of larger objects (Barnes et al., 2009;\nIvar do Sul et al., 2009), i.e., were secondary-sourced plastics\n(Arthur et al., 2009; Hidalgo-Ruz et al., 2012). The particle sizes\nvaried from ?1 mm to >5 mm (Fig. 1C), and the predominant col-\nours were white/transparent, black and a third group of coloured\nitems (Fig. 1D). The 300 lm mesh size is the most commonly used\nmesh for microplastics sampling (Hidalgo-Ruz et al., 2012) and was\nsuccessfully applied to sample microplastics.\n\nSurprisingly, we did not find any plastic resin pellets, commonly\npresent in oceanic plankton samples (Moore et al., 2001; Law et al.,\n2010) and on beaches of oceanic islands, such as the Fernando de\nNoronha Archipelago (3?S, 32?W) (Ivar do Sul et al., 2009). There,\nthe occurrence of plastic pellets was restricted to windward bea-\nches, constantly exposed to the northern branch of the SEC, which\nis also the prevalent large-scale wind-driven current observed in\nthe Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago. Therefore, local sources\nof items might be prevalent over long-range oceanic transport of\nplastics near round the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago.\n\nAt the Archipelago, all the identified microplastics have second-\nary sources. The pieces were weathered fragments of larger plastic\nitems, most likely polypropylene and polyethylene, which repre-\nsent the majority of the plastic polymers produced (and conse-\nquently discarded) worldwide (Andrady, 2011). In equatorial\noceans, where the sunlight radiation is intense, constant through-\nout the year and shines 12 h day?1, plastics are exposed to extreme\n\n\n\nFig. 2.

Fisheries are a recognised source of microplastics\nto the marine environment (Moore, 2008; Andrady, 2011), and\ntheir secondary-sourced fragments were previously identified in\nplankton tows elsewhere (i.e., Moore et al., 2001; Collignon et al.,\n2012; Hidalgo-Ruz et al., 2012). To illustrate the magnitude of this\nactivity in the Archipelago, commercial fishing has been named\nresponsible for the extinction of shark populations (Luiz and Ed-\nwards, 2011). Therefore, we considered that at least part of these\nfragments had autochthonous sources. However, as previously\nnoted by other researchers, it is much more difficult to determine\neven the most probable source of hard plastic fragments (e.g.,\nBarnes et al., 2009; Ivar do Sul et al., 2009).\n\nOnce the presence of microplastic fragments in the Archipelago\nwas confirmed, we asked if there was any particular behaviour (in\nthis case, the occurrence of microplastics) related to the distance\n(<1500 km) from this seamount, as observed for other living and\nnon-living particles around the Archipelago (Macedo-Soares\net al., 2012; Brand\u00e3o et al., 2013). To explain the distribution of\nmicroplastics around the Archipelago, a generalised linear model\n(GLM) was developed.\n\nEnvironmental variables that were considered relevant (and\nthat were available for the area) for explaining the distribution of\npelagic plastics around the Archipelago were assessed. These vari-\nables were the monthly total precipitation, water temperature and\nsalinity, wind velocity and direction and chlorophyll a level. Water\ntemperature and salinity were measured in situ concomitantly\nwith plankton tows. Chlorophyll a values were obtained from the\nliterature (Macedo-Soares et al., 2012), and wind velocity, wind\ndirection and precipitation were obtained from the nearest oceanic\nmooring (0?, 35?W) (http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/pirata/). We iden-\ntified two main seasons at the Archipelago (Table 1), characterised\nby high (300 mm) and low (25 mm) total monthly precipitation\n(Macedo-Soares et al., 2012). Other environmental variables also\nvaried seasonally (Table 1).\n\nSelected environmental variables were used as covariates in the\nGLM together with the zooplankton biomass and the sampling dis-\ntances from the Archipelago. Zooplankton biomass (dry weight)\nranged from 0.34 to 20.81 g m?3 during both the rainy and dry\nseasons.\n\nThe initial dataset with 630 lines, corresponding to the detailed\nmicroplastic characteristics of the 88plankton tows, was altered\nby adding values in different lines to form a new dataset with fewer\nzeros, which allowed the use of more consistent statistical methods.\nFirst, lines were merged for the rainy and dry seasons separately. Be-\ncause the number of zeros was still excessive, we merged the lines\nin the matrix considering the main colour of microplastics (white,\nblack and coloured) (Fig. 1D). The procedure was then repeated,\nconsidering microplastic size classes (<1 mm, 1.1\u20135 mm, >5 mm)\nand shapes (Fig. 1C and B, respectively). The final dataset had 18\nlines representing the two sampling seasons (rainy and dry) and\nthree distances (<100 m, 100\u2013500 m and 500\u20131500 m) from the\nArchipelago. This sum resulted in a new variable, the Total Mean\nDensity of microplastics(TMD microplastics m?3).\n\nThen, we started developing the GLM with eight environmental\ncovariates (i.e., monthly total precipitation, water temperature and\nsalinity, zooplankton biomass, sampling distances from the Archi-\n\nhttp://www.pmel.noaa.gov/pirata/\n\n\nFig. 3.

We used an Exploratory Data Analysis\n(EDA), a stepwise process and the AIC criteria to select the most\nadequate GLM until no further improvement was possible. Non-\nsignificant variables were progressively eliminated until the final\nmodel was obtained (Eq. (1)). Those variables with numerical val-\nues that remained fairly constant throughout the year (mainly be-\ncause the Archipelago is in an equatorial oceanic region) or that\napparently did not influence the densities of plastic fragments\nwere left out of the model. Finally, the selected covariates included\nin the GLM were those two that could significantly (p &lt;0.1) explain\nthe TMD of microplastics around the Saint Peter and Saint Paul\nArchipelago (Eq. (1)).\n\nTo validate the selected model, a residual analysis was also con-\nducted. The normal probability plot with envelopes (Fig. 3A) did\nnot show any unusual behaviour. Thus, the hypothesis of normal\ndistribution for the errors of the model can be used. The plot of\ndeviance-component residuals versus fitted values (Fig. 3B) also\npresented a randomised behaviour. The GLM was built using R\nsoftware (R Development Core Team 2009).\n\nOur final GLM has two (from initial 8) covariates, zooplankton-\nbiomass (Zoobiom) and sampling distances from the Archipelago\n(Dist100, Dist500 and Dist1500), which were significant to explain\nthe behaviour of the TMD of microplastics (Yi) sampled around\nthe Archipelago:\n\nY i \u00bc expfb0 \u00fe b1 Dist500i \u00fe b2 Dist1500i \u00fe b3Zoobiomig\u00fe ei i \u00bc 1; . . . ; 18\n\u00f01\u00de\n\nwhere i is the number of observations, ei ?

The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) =\n?70.057 (br2 = 0.0008). The GLM indicates that the Total Mean Den-\nsity ( dTMD) of microplastics decreases outward, while the zooplank-\nton biomass is constant (Fig. 1E and Eqs. (2)\u2013(4)).\n\nOceanographic mechanisms around the Saint Peter and Saint\nPaul Archipelago promote the topographic trapping of zooplankton\n(Genin, 2004; Macedo-Soares et al., 2012; Brand\u00e3o et al., 2013).\nTherefore, microplastics may likewise aggregate and be retained\nbysmall-scale circulation patterns. Reef fish (Macedo-Soares\net al., 2012) and semi-terrestrial decapod larvae (Brand\u00e3o et al.,\n2013) are more abundant at distances &lt;100 m from the Archipel-\nago than further away. However, holopelagic decapods (Brand\u00e3o\net al., 2013), which reproduce in pelagic environments, follow\nthe opposite trend. This pattern reinforces the results shown by\nour model and our suggestion of the occurrence of autochthonous\nsources. Microplastics might be retained close to the Archipelago,\nas are reef fish larvae.\n\nMoreover, microplastics are known to be ingested by planktiv-\norous fishes (Boerger et al., 2010), which are then preyed on by top\npredators. A possible pathway along the trophic web in the Saint\nPeter and Saint Paul Archipelago is suggested because the transfer\nof microplastics along marine food webs is a demonstrated issue\n(Eriksson and Burton, 2003; Farrell and Nelson, 2013). Cypselurus\ncyanopterus is an example of a planktivorous fish preyed on by sea-\nbirds, such as Sula leucogaster, and large pelagic fishes, such as\nThunnus albacares (Vaske et al., 2005), which are important eco-\nlogic and economic taxa that might be exposed to microplastic pol-\nlution. This exposure is a concern in the context of the\nenvironment\u2019s isolation and the risk of microplastics pollution at\nthe individual to community levels.\nReferences\n\nAndrady, A.L., 2011.

Neustonic tows (N=160) were\nconducted near three important insular environments\n(Fernando de Noronha, Abrolhos and Trindade), and\nthe presence of microplastics in the ocean surface of\nthese areas was confirmed for the first time. The collect-\ned microplastic particles included hard plastic frag-\nments, plastic films, paint chips and fibres and strands,\nwhich were classified as a secondary source of\nmicroplastics. The stock of plastic originates from both\nland-based and marine-based sources.

The fates and conse-\nquences of macroplastics (>5 mm) in oceanic and coast-\nal environments and to the marine biota have been\ndocumented over the last 40 years (Moore 2008;\nBarnes et al. 2009; Thompson et al. 2009). However,\nthe fragmentation of macroplastics to mesoplastics and\nmicroplastics remains poorly understood (Andrady\n2011). Therefore, the current focus of the scientific\ncommunity is on one of the smallest fractions of plastic\npollution (i.e. microplastics&lt;5 mm) (Barnes et al. 2009;\nIvar do Sul and Costa 2014).\n\nRecently, research on microscopic plastic particles\nhas significantly increased worldwide (Cole et al.\n2011; Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012; Ivar do Sul and Costa\n2014). Microplastics pose a substantial threat to marine\nbiota via ingestion because they are similar in size to\nmany organisms in the benthos and plankton communi-\nties. Therefore, microplastics are widely available to the\nentire marine food web (Wright et al. 2013). Uptake\ndepends on the size, shape and density of the particles\n(Browne et al. 2011). For vertebrates, the ingestion of\nplastics was suggested to be related to the type and\ncolour of plastics prevalent in the marine environment\n(Ryan 2008). Studies on invertebrates are predominant-\nly restricted to laboratory experiments (Wright et al.\n2013), and the extent of the problem remains largely\nspeculative (Ivar do Sul and Costa 2014). Moreover, the\norganic and inorganic chemical compounds in seawater\n\nWater Air Soil Pollut (2014) 225:2004\nDOI 10.1007/s11270-014-2004-z\n\nJ. A. Ivar do Sul: M. F.

If ingested,\ncontaminants may be released into gastrointestinal tracts\nand eventually contaminate tissues and organs (Tanaka\net al. 2013).\n\nMicroplastics are directly released into the envi-\nronment (i.e. primary source microplastics)\n(Thompson et al. 2009; Fendall and Sewell 2009)\nand continually formed at sea through degradation\nand subsequent fragmentation from larger plastic\nitems (i.e. secondary source fragments) (Andrady\n2011). The relative importance of secondary and pri-\nmary source microplastics in the open ocean has yet to\nbe established; however, recent evidence indicates\nthat fragments are mostly sampled (e.g. Ryan 2008;\nLaw et al. 2010). Polyethylene (PE) and polypropyl-\nene (PP) have a high probability of ending up in\nmarine environments (Andrady 2011) because they\nare more widely produced (Table 1) and discarded.\nThese polymers are denser than seawater, which\nmakes them positively buoyant. Polyethylene tere-\nphthalate (PET) and rigid polystyrene (PS) are also\npolymers that are widely used in the production of\nthrow-away plastics; however, they are not observed\non the sea surface because they sink.\n\nThe sea surface and beach sediments are environ-\nmental matrices that are more widely studied in terms\nof microplastic pollution (Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012).\nThe literature, which covers many regions over vary-\ning time periods, confirms that microplastic pollution\nis ubiquitous and frequently contaminates the sea\nsurface, especially in the Northern Hemisphere (Ivar\ndo Sul and Costa 2014). Pelagic plastics have been\nreported in the North Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, at\nthe centre of subtropical gyres (Moore et al. 2001;\nLaw et al. 2010) and along urbanised coastal areas\n(Lattin et al. 2004; Doyle et al. 2011). Microplastics\nhave been sampled in the western Mediterranean Sea\n(Collignon et al. 2012), the North Sea (Dubaish and\nLiebezeit 2013) and the Laurentian Great Lakes\n(Eriksen et al. 2013a).\n\nIn the equatorial region, microplastics have been\nsampled around a remote archipelago in the Atlantic\nOcean (Ivar do Sul et al. 2013). However, data on the\npresence and characteristics of microplastic pollution in\nthe Southern Hemisphere is significantly more limited.\nSurface tows have confirmed the presence of\nmicroplastics in the South Pacific subtropical gyre. They\n\noccurred in smaller densities but within the same range\nof magnitude as the density of microplastics in the North\nPacific (Eriksen et al. 2013b). In the Atlantic Ocean,\nRyan (1988) reported the presence of pelagic plastics\naround the African continent, whereas Barnes et al.\n(2009) confirmed their occurrence in the Southern\nOcean.\n\nBecause no systematic study has been developed for\nthe western tropical Atlantic, this study aimed to con-\nfirm the presence of floating microplastic particles in\nthat region for the first time. Sampling was conducted\naround three insular environments (i.e. Fernando de\nNoronha Archipelago, Abrolhos Archipelago and\nTrindade Island) located within the \u2018Blue Amazon\u2019, a\ndomain of approximately 4.5 million km2 that includes\nthe continental shelf and the Brazilian Exclusive Eco-\nnomic Zone (EEZ). The oligotrophic South Equatorial\nCurrent (SEC) is the major southern pathway by which\nwater is transported into the tropical Atlantic (Stramma\nand Schott 1999). The central and southern branches of\nthe SEC and the Brazilian Current are the main superfi-\ncial currents that reach the studied islands (Lumpkin and\nGarzoli 2005) (Fig. 1a). The local circulation patterns\nremain unknown.\n\nThe mountain peaks of a volcanic cordillera along the\nMid-Atlantic Ridge form the Fernando de Noronha\nArchipelago (Fig. 1a). The main island has an area of\n17 km2 and is the only inhabited island with a popula-\ntion of 3,000 residents. An additional 80,000 tourists\nvisit the archipelago annually. The average air tempera-\nture is approximately 25 \u00b0C, and constant winds have a\npredominant SE direction (Fig. 1b). The Abrolhos Ar-\nchipelago is on an enlargement of the Brazilian conti-\nnental shelf (Fig. 1a). This archipelago is formed by five\nsmall (100\u20131,000 m in length) islands (i.e. Santa\nB\u00e1rbara, Redonda, Siriba, Sueste and Guarita) arranged\nin a semicircle (Fig. 1c). Only one island is inhabited\n(<10 people); however, 4,000 tourists visit the archipel-\nago annually. The average air temperature is approxi-\nmately 27 \u00b0C, and constant winds have predominantly\nSE/E direction (Fig. 1c). The volcanic islands of\nTrindade (8 km2) and Martin Vaz in the Trindade-\nVit\u00f3ria seamount chain are 5,600 m above the ocean\nfloor and 600 m above sea level (Fig. 1a). The average\nair temperature is approximately 24 \u00b0C, and constant\nwinds have a predominant NE/E direction (Fig. 1d).\nUnlike the other studied islands, Trindade is a military\nbase where activities are restricted and tourism is\nprohibited.\n\n2004, Page 2 of 13 Water Air Soil Pollut (2014) 225:2004\n\n\n\nAfter microplastics in the western tropical Atlantic\nwere detected, we determined the density, type, size and\ncolour of the microplastics, which objectively reflects\nthe contamination patterns of the entire western Atlan-\ntic. Finally, the contamination patterns of Fernando de\nNoronha, Abrolhos and Trindade were compared.\n\n2 Materials and Methods\n\n2.1 Survey Methods\n\nOne hundred and sixty neustonic plankton tows were\nconducted around the islands of Fernando de Noronha,\nAbrolhos and Trindade using an inflatable boat. Sam-\nples were collected in the austral summers of 2011/2012\nand 2012/2013 using a manta trawl net (3.5 m in length\nwith a 300-?m mesh size) that was equipped with a\nflowmeter (Moore et al. 2001). The size of the rectan-\ngular net opening was 0.9\u00d70.15 m2. Each sample was\nobtained at an average speed of 1.5 knots for 15 min.\nThe tows were conducted at the windward and leeward\nside of each island according to the prevailing winds\n(Fig. 1b, c, d). Samples (500 ml) were fixed in 4 %\nformalin before storage. In the laboratory, samples were\nfiltered and freeze-dried. The dried material was\n\nweighed (0.01 g) and observed under a stereomicro-\nscope (5X) (Ivar do Sul et al. 2013).\n\nThe microplastics were separated and classified accord-\ning to their appearance/shape, size and colour. The follow-\ning five categories were defined: hard plastic fragments,\nplastic films, paint chips, fibres and strands (Fig. 2 a-e).\nPlastic resin pellets were only detected in small amounts\n(n=4, 1.6 % of the total) and not treated as a separate\ncategory in this study. When detected, they were classified\nas hard plastic fragments because of their visual appear-\nance and hardness. Polystyrene foam was not observed in\nthese samples. For fragments, films and paint chips, each\nitem was individually sorted, counted and measured (lon-\ngest axis\u2014mm). The volume (m3) of each individual tow\nwas obtained with a flowmeter and used to calculate the\ndensity of microplastic particles, which was expressed as\nparticles per cubic metre of seawater.\n\nIn this study, fibres and strands were treated sepa-\nrately. By visual identification, the strands were ob-\nserved to be significantly thinner than the fibres\n(Fig. 2d, e). Although the fibres and strands have been\nsorted, they have not been separated and individually\nmeasured because high amounts were detected in the\ncontaminated samples. However, we combined all of\nthe fibres and strands from each sample in a Petri dish\nthat used millimetre paper with 3\u00d73 mm2 squares as a\nreference. Then, we measured the area (mm2) of the\n\nTable 1 Polymers compositions identified by analytical procedures (appearance/shape) in surface seawater samples.

The\ndata were transformed (Box and Cox 1964) to increase\nthe normality of the distribution. An a posteriori Fisher\u2019s\nLSD test was used to determine significantly different\nmeans at a probability level of 0.05 when the results\nfrom the ANOVA showed a significant difference.\n\nF.

Plankton samples weighed 144.7 g (total dry\nweight) and included marine algae, zooplankton,\nichthyoplankton and other materials (e.g. terrestrial leaves\nand feathers). Two outliers were identified for Fernando de\nNoronha and Abrolhos, which represented 56 and 40 % of\nthe dry weight, respectively. From the 160 net tows, 68 %\ncontained microplastics from the five predefined categories\n(Fig. 2). Proportionally, Trindade was the most contami-\nnated with ?90 % (n=64) of all samples containing\nmicroplastic debris. Approximately half of the samples\ncollected from Abrolhos (n=48) and Fernando de Noronha\n(n=48) contained microplastic debris.\n\nTherefore, the presence of pelagic microplastics in\nthe western tropical Atlantic Ocean was confirmed.\nSurface tows have been successfully applied to sample\nmicroplastics in the open ocean (Hidalgo-Ruz et al.\n2012) using small-scale ~1.5 km (Ivar do Sul et al.\n2013) and large-scale ~4 \u00d7 103 km (Law et al. 2010)\nsurveys. Several microplastic categories sampled in this\nstudy (i.e. hard plastic fragments, plastic films and paint\nchips) (Fig. 2) are comparable to others that have been\ncollected elsewhere (Mor\u00e9t-Ferguson et al. 2010; Doyle\n\net al. 2011; Eriksen et al. 2013a), including in the\nequatorial Atlantic Ocean (Ivar do Sul et al. 2013).\nAmongst them, hard plastic fragments commonly rep-\nresent the majority of plastic items detected in plankton\nsamples (Moore et al. 2001). Indeed, few primary source\nplastics (i.e. resin plastic pellets) were sampled in this\nstudy. However, they were commonly collected with\nother floating microplastic particles (e.g. Mor\u00e9t-\nFerguson et al. 2010; Eriksen et al. 2013b), such as in\nthe net tows conducted in the South Atlantic Ocean in\nthe early 1980s (Morris 1980). Moreover, in the western\nAtlantic, the occurrence of plastic pellets on windward\nbeaches in the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago has\nbeen previously reported (Ivar do Sul et al. 2009). After\nstudying the gastrointestinal tracts of seabirds that\ningested plastics in a marine environment, Ryan\n(2008) also reported the dominance of plastic fragments.\nThe proportion of plastic pellets significantly decreased\nfrom 1980 to the 2000s, but because the total load of\ningested plastics did not significantly vary between de-\ncades, the author attributed this change to the increase in\nsecondary source plastics in the environment (Ryan\n2008).\n\nThese evidences suggest that the highest proportion\nof total floating particles is plastic fragments, whereas\nthe smallest proportion is pellets (Mor\u00e9t-Ferguson et al.\n2010; Doyle et al. 2011; Eriksen et al. 2013b). During\n\nFig. 2 Hard plastic fragments (a), plastic films (b), paint chips (c), fibres (d, f) and strands (e) collected from surface waters in the western\ntropical Atlantic Ocean\n\nWater Air Soil Pollut (2014) 225:2004 Page 5 of 13, 2004\n\n\n\nthe last 30\u201340 years, an increase in the use of single-use,\nthrow-away products, which are eventually lost to the\nocean, has been observed. Additionally, there has been\nan increase in the number of routes and fleets in the sea\nand the use of synthetic nets in the fishing industry.\nPlastic debris degrades slowly in marine environments.\nThe fragmentation processes of various polymers re-\nmain speculative and restricted to controlled laboratory\nexperiments. Therefore, over the last few decades, frag-\nments have been continually formed at sea and\ntransported from coastal areas to the open ocean, where\nthey accumulate. If this is confirmed, the number of\nsecondary source plastics in open oceans will continu-\nally increase until the fragmentation process stabilises.\n\nFibres and strands have not been frequently reported\nin plankton tows and remain associated with sedimen-\ntary environments (Ivar do Sul and Costa 2014). Nu-\nmerous previous works have used archived samples to\nstudy microplastic debris on the sea surface (e.g. Law\net al. 2010; Mor\u00e9t-Ferguson et al. 2010). Fibres may be\nlost when chemical substances (e.g. formaldehyde) are\nused to preserve the plankton samples. Indeed, because\nplastic fragments are prevalent and relatively easy to\ndistinguish, fibres can be misidentified during laborato-\nry work unless they occur in significant amounts, which\nis when the fibres can be differentiated as synthetic\nmaterials. Analytical techniques are still required to\nconclusively identify the type of polymer (Browne\net al. 2011). Finally, the presence of fibres and strands\nin this study was detected in higher amounts compared\nwith previous studies in the literature.\n\n3.2 Fragments and Paint Chips\n\nA total of 243 plastic particles were sampled (Table 2,\nFig. 2a, b, c), and the mean contamination was determined\nto be 1.52 particles per tow. Hard plastic fragments (78 %)\n(Fig. 2a) were significantly more sampled (ANOVA, p=\n0.000) than plastic films and paint chips. The majority\n(75 %) were 5 mm or smaller. Plastic films (9 % of the\ntotal) were also&lt;5 mm in size (70 %) (Table 2). In the\nAtlantic Ocean, most (70\u201390 %) of the sampled particles\nwere smaller than 10 mm and usually&lt;5 mm (Law et al.\n2010; Mor\u00e9t-Ferguson et al. 2010; Ivar do Sul et al. 2013).\nBecause of their size, they are available to any level of the\nmarine food web (Wright et al. 2013), from primary pro-\nducers to large top predators (Ivar do Sul and Costa 2014).\nFew studies have reported on the prevalence of specific\ncolours (e.g. Shaw and Day 1994); therefore, ingestion is\n\nmore likely related to the availability of particles in the\nmarine environment than to any colour-based selectivity\namongst vertebrates (Boerger et al. 2010). However, addi-\ntional studies are required. In this study, white and trans-\nparent plastic particles were more prevalent, but not sig-\nnificantly, than coloured particles (Table 3) (ANOVA,\np>0.05). This pattern was previously observed in the\nNorth Pacific Ocean (Shaw and Day 1994). The colour\ndistribution of the floating plastics may be an indicator of\nthe residence time of the plastic on the sea surface and may\nreveal any ingestion preferences by the marine biota.\nTherefore, the effect of microplastic colour has to be\naddressed in future studies.\n\nPaint chips represented 12 % of the sampled plastic\nparticles for the islands studied (Table 2, Fig. 2c). They\nare usually generated in boatyards, shipyards and at sea\nduring the repair, maintenance and cleaning of vessel\nhulls. In the marine environment, they measure several\ncentimetres to a few micrometres in length (Turner\n2010). Moreover, evidence suggests that they can also\nfragment in the marine environment through erosion, a\nlargely unstudied process. However, it is expected that\nantifouling substances used in paint formulations are\nreleased during this process (Singh and Turner 2009;\nTurner 2010), which is potentially threatening to the\nenvironment and its biota. Their distribution in the sea\nsurface has not yet been systematically addressed\n(Turner 2010); however, a few studies have conclusive-\nly identified these particles in neuston samples (Mor\u00e9t-\nFerguson et al. 2010; Eriksen et al. 2013a). There is a\nsmall port in Fernando de Noronha that maintains and\nservices traditional boats; therefore, the presence of\npaint chips is expected. There is no port on Trindade;\nhowever, it is along the route of many boats and ships,\nwhich may remain in the area for extended periods (i.e.\nlongline fishing vessels) (Pinheiro et al. 2010).\n\nIn the western tropical Atlantic, the mean concentra-\ntion of plastic particles in the neuston was 0.03 particles\nper cubic metre of seawater (Table 4). Around the S\u00e3o\nPedro e S\u00e3o Paulo Archipelago (Ivar do Sul et al. 2013),\nin the Southeast Bering Sea and along the southern\nCalifornia coast (Doyle et al. 2011), the densities of\nmicroplastics were on the same order of magnitude as\nthose sampled in this study. The highest density of a\nsingle tow (0.13 particles m?3) around the island of\nTrindade was comparable to coastal regions near highly\nurbanised areas (i.e. Los Angeles, CA) (Doyle et al.\n2011) and values reported for other oceanic basins\n(Ivar do Sul and Costa 2014; Table 4).\n\n2004, Page 6 of 13 Water Air Soil Pollut (2014) 225:2004\n\n\n\n3.2.1 Comparisons of the Studied Areas\n\nConsidering the total number of sampled particles\n(Table 2), Trindade was significantly more contam-\ninated than Abrolhos and Fernando de Noronha\n(ANOVA, p=0.000). If only hard plastic fragments\nand plastic films were considered, both Trindade\n\nand Abrolhos were significantly more contaminat-\ned (ANOVA, p=0.000) by microplastic particles\nthan Fernando de Noronha. Similarly, considering\nthe density of microplastic debris (particles m?3),\nTrindade and Abrolhos were significantly more\ncontaminated than Fernando de Noronha (ANOVA,\np=0.005). The majority of items were hard plastic\n\nTable 2 Compilation of results related to particle size (mm)\n\nNoronha Arch. Abrolhos Arch.

Howev-\ner, there were no significant differences between\nthe leeward and windward sides of each island in\nterms of microplastic pollution.\n\nThe Fernando de Noronha Archipelago is currently\nless contaminated by microplastic particles than other\ninsular environments located in the western tropical\nAtlantic. The source of the floating particles that were\nsampled was probably not directly correlated to the\ngarbage generated on the studied islands (i.e. autochtho-\nnous sources). An extremely different scenario was\nobserved for Fernando de Noronha because it has a\nhigher population density and receives thousands of\ntourists each year compared to the other islands. There-\nfore, the microplastics floating around Fernando de\nNoronha, Abrolhos and Trindade are being transported\nby prevailing currents and winds on the sea surface until\nthey accumulate in the open ocean. It is difficult to\ndiscern whether these degraded fragments are being\ntransported over long distances from land-based sources\nor if they are plastic items that were illegally dumped at\nsea (i.e. marine-based sources). Plastic fragments do not\nretain information regarding their origin or most proba-\nble source (Barnes et al. 2009; Doyle et al. 2011; Ivar do\nSul et al. 2009). In Abrolhos, for instance, significant\nsedimentation rates (0.1\u20130.8 cm year-1) from large\nhydrographical basins (i.e. Doce and Jequitinhonha)\nare able to reach the inner shelf around the archipelago\n(Knoppers et al. 1999), which is only 70 km from the\nshore. Therefore, continental discharges may contribute\nto the amount of plastic sampled, as was observed along\nhighly populated coasts in the Northern Hemisphere\n(Ivar do Sul and Costa 2014).\n\nA general trend of increasing density (particles m-3)\nwith decreasing particles size was not observed in this\nstudy (Fig. 3). This pattern was previously reported in\nthe North Pacific gyre (Moore et al. 2001) and along the\nCalifornia coast (Doyle et al. 2011), where it was sug-\ngested to be related to the long-time permanence of\nsecondary source plastic particles in the marine environ-\nment (Andrady 2011). In the western tropical Atlantic,\nthe absence of such a pattern may indicate that plastics\nare continuously being released into the gyre faster than\nplastics are being fragmented in the ocean.\n\n3.3 Fibres and Strands\n\nA total area of 1,177 mm2 of microplastics in the\nform of fibres and strands were sampled. One item\nrepresented 75 % of this area (Fig. 2f). This item\nmay indicate that larger nets and ropes are\nfragmenting into smaller fibres and strands in ma-\nrine environments. The fragmentation process may\nbe more significant in tropical areas because the\nplastics are exposed to extreme degradation condi-\ntions (Andrady 2011; Ivar do Sul et al. 2013). The\nhorizontal interactions between biological and\nphysical mechanisms aggregate and concentrate\nplankton (Genin 2004), and most likely plastics\n(Ivar do Sul et al. 2013), near oceanic islands.\nThus, fibres and strands were retained and sampled\n\nTable 4 Comparison of the\npresent study with other sampled\nareas in relation to the distance\nfrom the coast (km)\n\nNPCG North Pacific central gyre\naBefore the storm\n\nDistance from\nthe coast (km)\n\nLocation Contamination\npatterns (particles m?3)\n\nSource\n\n0\u20135 California coast, USA 10a Moore et al. 2002\n\n0\u2013100 Mediterranean Sea 1.21 Collignon et al. 2012\n\n0\u2013500 NE Pacific Ocean 0.004\u20130.19 Doyle et al. 2011\n\n?1,000 Equatorial Atlantic Ocean 0.01 Ivar do Sul et al. 2013\n?2,000 NPCG 2.23 Moore et al. 2001\n70 Abrolhos Archipelago 0.04 This study\n\n350 Fernando de Noronha\nArchipelago\n\n0.015\n\n1,200 Trindade Island 0.025\n\n70\u20131,200 Tropical Atlantic Ocean 0.03\n\nFig. 3 Size versus density (particles m?3) of hard plastic frag-\nments, plastic films and paint chips in a Fernando de Noronha, b\nAbrolhos and c Trindade.

For comparison, when the\noutlier is excluded (Table 5), this area (fibres plus\nstrands) represents one third of the total area occu-\npied by hard plastic fragments, plastic films and\npaint ships (>900 mm2) in the same sample. If the\nhard plastic fragments were sorted on a Petri dish\nas fibres, they would occupy a larger surface area\nthan the fibres and would be considered to be\ncomparatively prevalent. In this way, the plankton\ntows sampled in this study were also more contam-\ninated with plastic fragments as well as others that\nhave been reported elsewhere (Barnes et al. 2009;\nHidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012; Ivar do Sul and Costa\n2014). The mean contamination was 1.88 mm2 of\nfibres and strands per tow for all of the islands.\n\nBy visual identification, fibres (Fig. 2d) resemble\nfragments of fishing lines and have commonly been\nsampled in other surface plankton tows (e.g. Moore\net al. 2001; Mor\u00e9t-Ferguson et al. 2010), including in\nthe equatorial Atlantic Ocean (Ivar do Sul et al. 2013).\nLarger fishing lines are already widely recognised as a\nthreat to marine biota, including large vertebrates and\n\ninvertebrates (i.e. coral reefs, lobsters) because of the\nrisk of entanglement (Moore 2008). It is possible that\nsmall fragments form fibres in the marine environment\ncould potentially be ingested.\n\nStrands are easily identified as synthetic polymers.\nUsing a stereomicroscope, they are distinguished from\nnatural particulates because of their bright and diverse\ncolours (i.e. blue, red, green), which do not resemble\nmarine animal and plant tissue (Browne et al. 2011).\nStrands have previously been reported in neuston sam-\nples that used meshes with smaller apertures in the\nsampling procedure (Thompson et al. 2004; Dubaish\nand Liebezeit 2013). In the North Sea, strands were\ncorrelated with the discharge of a local sewage treatment\nplant and most likely originated from the abrasion of\nsynthetic textiles (i.e. polyester and polyacrylate) in\nwashing machines (Dubaish and Liebezeit 2013).\nBrowne et al.

This is a relevant source of plastics for\nislands located far from continental shores; however, no\nconclusive origins have been determined. In the Clyde\nSea, lobsters (Nephrops) ingested microplastic strands\nthat had fragmented from fishing ropes (Murray and\nCowie 2011). Such plastics are particularly hazardous\nbecause they may clump and knot, which may prevent\negestion (Murray and Cowie 2011; Cole et al. 2011).\nThis type of microplastic debris was also reported in the\ngastrointestinal tracts of mesopelagic and\nbenthophagous fish in oceanic (Davison and Asch\n2011) and estuarine (Possatto et al. 2011) areas. It ap-\npears that they are distributed worldwide within the\nmarine environment and its biota. Depending on the\ntype and shape of the polymer, an increased bioavail-\nability of adsorbed organic chemical compounds to\nmarine environments could be observed (Browne et al.\n2011), which further emphasises the environmental\nrisks of microplastics to marine biota.\n\n3.3.1 Comparisons Amongst the Studied Areas\n\nThe island of Trindade was predominately contaminated\nwith microplastics in the form of fibres and strands\nwhen the area of the Petri dish and the total number of\ntows were considered (Table 5). However, no significant\ndifferences to the other islands were reported when both\nthe total sample area (ANOVA, p=0.345) and density\n(mm2/m3) (p=0.331) of fibres were considered. Simi-\nlarly, no significant patterns were reported for the lee-\nward and windward sides of the islands.\n\nAround the island of Trindade, fishing is a regular\nactivity, even in swallow waters&lt;2 km from the island\n(Pinheiro et al. 2010). Four different fisheries were iden-\ntified (i.e. pelagic longline, bottom line, trolling and\nhandline), which included the Brazilian fleet and clandes-\ntine vessels (Pinheiro et al. 2010). Indeed, signs of\noverfishing are evident (Pinheiro et al. 2010, 2011). In\nthe S\u00e3o Pedro e S\u00e3o Paulo Archipelago, fishing was\nmainly associated with the occurrence of plastic threads\n(Ivar do Sul et al. 2013). This association was also\nreported in other studies on worldwide microplastic pol-\nlution (e.g. Moore et al. 2001; Mor\u00e9t-Ferguson et al.\n2010). If fishing or maritime activities as a whole are\nconfirmed as potential sources of microplastic fibres and\nstrands to the marine environment, this type of pollution\n\nthreatens all the insular habitats in this study, the Brazilian\nEEZ and the entire western tropical Atlantic.\n\n4 Final Remarks\n\nFloating microplastic particles are polluting the western\ntropical Atlantic, as confirmed by neustonic tows that were\nconducted around important insular environments.\nMicroplastic pollution is most likely to be widespread over\nthe entire surface of the tropical Atlantic Ocean, especially\nregarding the types of items. In this study, the contamina-\ntion patterns were less than 1,000 particles km-2. The\ncounterpart gyre in the North Atlantic is significantly more\ncontaminated with microplastics (>20,000 particles km-2 at\n30\u00b0 N) (Law et al. 2010); however, densities similar to\nthose measured in our study have been reported in the\nCaribbean Sea.\n\nSecondary source microplastics were largely domi-\nnant, which is a pattern that has also been reported for\nother oceanic basis, including subtropical gyres. The\nprevalence of fragments makes inferences about sources\nlimited. Their origin is likely from either land-based or\nmarine-based sources, such as from damaged fishing\ngear or other maritime activities that are performed at\nsea. However, only a few categories of items were\nsampled in this survey (Fig. 2), which was a recurring\nfinding for all of the islands studied. Therefore, it is\nreasonable to assume that at least part of these fragments\noriginated from the same source, which is occurring in\nthe entire western Atlantic Ocean. FTIR analysis is the\nstandard method that is used to conclusively determine\nthe type of polymer, which reveals information regard-\ning the possible source and origin of the microplastic\nfragment in the marine environment.\n\nThe presence of marine-based sources, if confirmed,\nemphasises the increased vulnerability of these islands\nand its organisms to marine pollution. Floating plastics\nemanate from everywhere, and there is currently no\nmechanism to abate this type of pollution (see recent\ndiscussion in Ivar do Sul and Costa 2014). Scientific\npredictions suggest that climate changes may affect cir-\nculation patterns and, consequently, the movement, accu-\nmulation and retention of plastic debris in space and time\n(Howell et al. 2012). The presented results could then\nalso be used as a threshold measurement for contamina-\ntion patterns in the western tropical Atlantic region.\n\nBecause the presence of microplastic debris was\nconfirmed, it is important to predict the probable threat\n\nWater Air Soil Pollut (2014) 225:2004 Page 11 of 13, 2004\n\n\n\nit poses to the marine biota in the western tropical\nAtlantic. Microplastics are known to be ingested by\nvertebrates and invertebrates in the plankton, nekton\nand benthos communities, which introduces them into\nthe marine food web (Ivar do Sul and Costa 2014). The\nislands of Fernando de Noronha, Abrolhos and Trindade\nare, naturally, regions of high endemism and are most at\nrisk for microplastic debris pollution.\n\nFor example, the Abrolhos Archipelago shelters the\nrichest marine biodiversity in the South Atlantic Ocean\n(Werner et al. 2000). The archipelago is also an impor-\ntant region for the calving and feeding of newborn\nhumpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) along the\nBrazilian coast. The ingestion of microplastics by ceta-\nceans was reported in the Mediterranean Sea (Fossi et al.\n2012); therefore, whales, including pups and juveniles,\nare at the eminent risk of ingesting microplastic pollu-\ntion in the archipelago.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence of microplastic pollution\nin this study and in the S\u00e3o Pedro e S\u00e3o Paulo Archi-\npelago (Ivar do Sul et al. 2013) confirm that microplastic\npollution is widespread throughout the western tropical\nAtlantic Ocean. In the near future, it is also important to\ninvestigate the marine region adjacent to the Rocas\nAtoll, where microplastics are also likely to be found.\nThe focus of the scientific community must be on the\ncontinuous process of identifying sources of\nmicroplastic debris in the global oceans.\n\nAcknowledgments We are grateful to the National Council for\nScientific and Technological Research (CNPq) for the Ph.D. schol-\narship provided to Juliana A.

The occurrence \n\nand characteristics of microplastics were investigated in beaches of Fernando de Noronha, \n\nAbrolhos and Trindade islands in the western tropical Atlantic Ocean. Despite no \n\nmicroplastic pollution was; identified in Abrolhos, small spatial variations were detected \n\nin Fernando de Noronha and Trinidade islands. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Blue Amazon, oceanic islands, marine conservation, plastic fragments, virgin \n\nplastic pellets, size class. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\nIntroduction \n\nMacroplastics fragment on beach environments (i.e., secondary source fragments) \n\n(Andrady, 2011) and these fragments have been incorporated in coastal sediments around \n\nthe world (Barnes et al., 2009). Field data confirm that microplastics (&lt;5mm) are an \n\nabundant size fraction of plastic debris pollution (e.g., Browne et al., 2011) being \n\nwidespread throughout the oceans and seas (e.g., Depledge et al., 2013, Ivar do Sul and \n\nCosta, 2014), including deep-sea sediments (Cauwenberghe et al., 2013). Virgin plastic \n\npellets and other particles manufactured to be of a microscopic size (i.e., primary source \n\nmicroplastics) are also incorporated to beach sediments after storm-water discharges and \n\ndirect spills into the sea (e.g., McDermid and McMullen, 2004, Fendall and Sewell, 2009, \n\nIvar do Sul et al., 2009).  \n\nMicroplastics are probably much more hazardous than macroplastics to marine \n\norganisms from every level of the marine food web though ingestion (Wright et al., 2013). \n\nEvidences suggest that microplastic fragments, including fibres, can mimic natural food \n\ninciting ingestion events (Moore, 2008). Microplastic particles are also more efficient in \n\nthe transport of sorbed organic and inorganic contaminants to remote areas, and can \n\ncontaminate organisms once ingested (Tanaka et al., 2013).  \n\nMicroplastics have been sampled on beach sediments through different methods, \n\nmost focused on the recent particles deposited on the surface (e.g., Barnes et al., 2009, \n\nHidalgo-Ruz et al., 2012). On mud sediments around industrialised areas, microplastics \n\nin the form of fibres are been commonly related to sewage and wastewater discharges \n\n(Browne et al., 2011). In oceanic islands, where small-sized sediments (i.e., sand) \n\naccumulate, beaches are frequently reported to be heavily impacted by ocean-borne \n\nplastics in the same size range of sediments, mainly in the Pacific Ocean (McDermid and \n\nMcMullen, 2004, Moore, 2008, Hidalgo-Ruz et al., 2012, Ivar do Sul and Costa, 2014). \n\nIn addition, in the Atlantic Ocean, primary source microplastic particles originating far \n\nfrom their shores and fragments were sampled on sandy beaches in the Fernando de \n\nNoronha archipelago (Ivar do Sul et al., 2009). Moreover, it is expected (Barnes et al., \n\n2009, Ivar do Sul and Costa, 2014) that this type of marine debris pollution currently \n\ncontaminates other insular beaches in the western tropical Atlantic Ocean, but the extent \n\nof the problem is still unknown.  \n\nHence, the present study investigated, for the first time, the assessment of \n\nmicroplastic contamination (occurrence and physic characteristics) deposited on beaches \n\nin the Abrolhos archipelago and Trindade island, in the tropical western Atlantic Ocean \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\n(Figure 1A), including a sample re-purposing in the Fernando de Noronha archipelago. \n\nDifferent aspects related to microplastic debris contamination were assessed and \n\ndiscussed. \n\nMaterial and Methods \n\nA total of 20 beaches were surveyed once in Fernando de Noronha (3\u00b0S, 32\u00b0W) \n\n(13 beaches), Abrolhos (17\u00b0S, 38\u00b0W) (3 beaches) and Trindade (20\u00b0S, 29\u00b0W) (4 beaches) \n\nislands during the austral summer season (2011/2012, 2012/2013). One sediment sample \n\n(80 g) was collected in the centre of the beach arc to grain size characterization. The dry \n\nsieving method and the Folk and Ward (1957) classification were applied in this study \n\n(Table 1).  \n\nIn the tropical western Atlantic Ocean, the circulation of the atmosphere (i.e., \n\nsoutheast trade winds and the westerlies) primarily drives the upper ocean large-scale \n\ncirculation in the southern hemisphere. The nearest oceanic moorings \n\n(http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/pirata/) were consulted to classify the sampled beaches into \n\ntwo groups: windward (9) and leeward (11) beaches, according to the prevailing winds in \n\nthe area of the islands (Ivar do Sul et al., 2014) (Table 1).  \n\nFor microplastic survey, the strandline (1m wide) was sampled by scraping the \n\ntwo first centimetres of sand from 900cm2 quadrats (Ivar do Sul et al., 2009). Three \n\nquadrats were thrown along the strandline on each surveyed beach. Then, a total of 60 \n\nsamples was collected. Sediment samples were taken to the laboratory where they were \n\noven-dried at 100\u00b0C overnight. The dry samples were weighted and sieved through a 0? \n\n(1mm) sieve. Two types of plastics were identified and classified as hard plastic \n\nfragments and virgin plastic pellets (Figure 1D, E). Individual items were then sorted by \n\nsize class and colour, measured and photographed. All images were obtained with the \n\nAxioVs40 V 4.8.2.0 software from Carl Zeiss Vision. \n\nDensity of plastics particles was expressed as particles per square meter \n\n(particles/m\u00b2). Two hypotheses were tested with the Factorial Analysis of Variance \n\n(ANOVA): (1) there are differences in the total amounts of microplastics on windward \n\nand leeward beaches and; (2) types of microplastic particles are recurrent among the \n\nstudied islands, but hard plastic fragments are prevalent. Data was transformed (Box-Cox \n\ntransformation) to achieve normality, whilst homoscedasticity was tested with Levene\u2019s \n\ntest. Where ANOVA showed a significant difference, an a posteriori Fisher LSD test was \n\nused to determine which mean was significantly different (?=0.05). \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\nTable 1: Sampled beaches in Fernando de Noronha (350 km from the continent), Abrolhos (70 km \n\nfrom the continent) and Trindade (1,100km from the continent).

Microplastics were once again sampled on sandy beaches in the Fernando \n\nde Noronha archipelago as previously reported (Ivar do Sul et al., 2009).  \n\n \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 1: (A) Studied islands in the western tropical Atlantic Ocean: Fernando de Noronha, Abrolhos and \n\nTrindade. (B) Examples of white and coloured macroplastic (>5mm) fragments. (C) Examples of white and \n\ncoloured microplastic fragments and (D) virgin plastic pellets. All images were obtained with the AxioVs40 \n\nV 4.8.2.0 software from Carl Zeiss Vision.  \n\n \n\nA total of 1,151 plastic particles were detected in sand samples in this survey. \n\nTwenty-three quadrats (40%) in 12 beaches (60%) were contaminated (Table 2). In the \n\nTrindade island, three beaches were contaminated, but no plastic particle was sampled on \n\nPr\u00edncipe beach (leeward side). In Fernando de Noronha, five beaches are at this time free \n\nfrom this type of marine pollution; a single fragment was sampled on three beaches; and \n\nfive other beaches presented higher contamination hates (Table 2). \n\nQuantitatively, windward beaches were more contaminated by plastic particles \n\nthan the leeward beaches when all sampled beaches were considered (Hypothesis 1). This \n\nresult confirmed the influence of surface currents transporting floating marine debris in \n\nthe open ocean (i.e., Ivar do Sul et al., 2009). On the other hand, the absence of \n\nmicroplastic particles in Abrolhos Island during this survey is probably due to the beach \n\nsediment dynamics, which may remove all the sand, and consequently plastics, from \n\nbeaches. This process is cyclical, and may underestimate microplastic particles sampling \n\nin a specific time.  \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\n \n\n Table 2: Microplastic particles sampled in Fernando de Noronha and Trindade islands.

The Eastern Island is close to the eastern-centre region of the South \n\nPacific subtropical gyre, where pelagic plastics accumulate (Lebreton et al., 2012), \n\nshowing that ocenic islands actually act as deposit sites for pelagic microplastic debris at \n\nsea (Moore, 2008, Hidalgo-Ruz and Thiel, 2013). On Trindade windward beaches, \n\nhowever, densities reached the same order of magnitude than in the South Pacific Ocean \n\n(Hidalgo-Ruz and Thiel, 2013). Since this island is far from (1,100km) the continental \n\nshores, ocean-borne plastics may be prevalent over land-based sources of plastic debris.  \n\n \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\nCharacteristics of microplastic particles \n\nMicroplastics have an average size of 3.72\u00b12.21 mm in this study. Only two types \n\nof plastics were identified (hard plastic fragments and pellets) showing that types of items \n\nare recurrent in the tropical Atlantic (Ivar do Sul et al., 2013, Ivar do Sul et al., 2014). In \n\nterms of number of items, hard plastic fragments (Figure 1C) accounted for 60% of \n\nmicroplastic parricles (n=697). The numerical dominance of hard plastic fragments over \n\nvirgin plastic pellets (Figure 1D) is a predicted trend, according to the literature, in the \n\nPacific (Kushio and Noda, 2003, McDermid and McMullen, 2004, Hidalgo-Ruz and \n\nThiel, 2013, Moore 2008) and Atlantic oceans (Browne et al., 2010). However, densities \n\n(particles/m\u00b2) of hard plastic fragments were not significantly different than pellets \n\n(p=0.416) in the studied islands (Hypothesis 2).  \n\nFibres and strands (Ivar do Sul et al., 2014) were not detected during this survey. \n\nIn the North Sea, fragments were completely absent whereas fibres and pellets were \n\nsystematically sampled on the sediment surface of coastal islands (Liebezeit and Dubaish, \n\n2013). Moreover, synthetic fibres are being related to sewage discharges, including \n\nwashing machine effluents, mainly around high-populated areas (Browne et al., 2011). \n\nThe absence of fibres and the occurrence of plastic pellets may also indicate that \n\nmicroplastics were mostly from marine-based sources, and consequently transported by \n\nocean currents, when compared with sewage discharges (e.g., Claessens et al., 2011, \n\nHidalgo-Ruz and Thiel, 2013).  \n\nIn this study, white and transparent plastic particles were more prevalent (75%) as \n\npreviously observed elsewhere (e.g., Ivar do Sul and Costa, 2014). The colour distribution \n\nof the plastics on beaches, as well as on the sea surface (Ivar do Sul et al., 2014), may be \n\nan indicator of the residence time of the plastic on beach environments, the most likely \n\nsite for generation of microplastics in the marine environment (Andrady, 2011). \n\nFinal remarks \n\nThis study confirms the widespread occurrence of microplastics in the marine \n\necosystem, especially considering that those islands as far away from direct sources of \n\nland-based contamination (e.g., rivers, drainage systems), which are major sources of \n\nplastics to the environment (Browne et al., 2011).  \n\nSpatial variation in microplastic concentrations was observed on a relatively small \n\nscale (distance of few km) in Fernando de Noronha and Trindade. This may be due to \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\ndifferent current patterns, grain sizes, wave action and wind exposure of each beach. All \n\nbeaches are isolated from obvious plastic debris sources (i.e., dense human population \n\ncentres, plastic facilities). Then, it is most likely that plastics came from the adjacent \n\nmarine area, where ships and fishing boats generate pelagic plastics, which are recognized \n\nsources of plastic debris to the marine environment (e.g., Andrady, 2011, Ivar do Sul and \n\nCosta, 2014) or from long-range transport of items (Barnes et al., 2009).  \n\nBeyond the already established effects of ingestion, chemical leaching, and \n\ncontaminant adsorption (e.g., Moore, 2008), plastic pellets and microplastic fragments \n\nmay change the physical properties of beaches by increasing permeability and lowering \n\nsubsurface temperatures (~1\u00b0C) (Carson et al., 2011). This can affect the sex of \n\ntemperature-determinant organisms, such as sea turtles (e.g., a reduction in the number \n\nof females). Bioturbation of sediments on sea turtles nesting areas may also redistribute \n\nmicroplastics along the surface layer (1m), underestimating the amounts of sampled \n\nplastics. These might affect the quantification of beach plastics in Trindade and Fernando \n\nde Noronha since these islands are important nesting areas for Chelonia mydas.  \n\n Currently, the most widely used (~90%) synthetic plastics are low- and high-\n\ndensity polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polystyrene \n\n(PS) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) (Andrady, 2011). These polymers have been \n\nsuccessfully identified in sediment samples by FTIR and other techniques (e.g., Browne \n\net al., 2010, 2011), including pellets (e.g., Fotopoulou and Karapanagioti, 2012). Eroded \n\nPE pellets had their surface areas enlarged, indicating that they will interact more \n\nefficiently with chemical compounds in the marine environment (Fotopoulou and \n\nKarapanagioti, 2012). Microplastics fragments will probably follow the same pattern, \n\nrepresenting greater risks to organisms through ingestion.  \n\nRecently, new methods to sample, quantify and/or identify microplastics on \n\nsediments have been developed by several research groups. Since a range of different \n\nmethods have been applied, a direct comparison of data from different studies is not \n\nadvisable (Ivar do Sul and Costa, 2014). Thus, a precise and comprehensive diagnosis of \n\nthis kind of marine contamination on sedimentary habitats remains to be done.  \n\nAcknowledgments  \n\nWe are grateful to the National Research Council (CNPq) for the PhD scholarship \n\nprovided to Juliana A.

Em \n\nconson\u00e2ncia com a comunidade cient\u00edfica internacional, que vem reportando de maneira acelerada a \n\ncontamina\u00e7\u00e3o por micropl\u00e1sticos em diversas bacias oce\u00e2nicas, os diferentes enfoques abordados \n\n(amostras de \u00e1gua e de sedimento) representam importantes ind\u00edcios de contamina\u00e7\u00e3o por \n\nmicropl\u00e1sticos no oeste do Oceano Atl\u00e2ntico tropical. Os m\u00e9todos amostrais empregados neste \n\ntrabalho s\u00e3o amplamente utilizados por pesquisadores em v\u00e1rias partes do mundo, e s\u00e3o considerados \n\ncapazes de diagnosticar o problema da polui\u00e7\u00e3o por micropl\u00e1sticos com efici\u00eancia.  \n\nOs tipos de part\u00edculas pl\u00e1sticas amostrados neste estudo possivelmente ocorrem na superf\u00edcie do \n\nmar em todo setor oeste do oceano Atl\u00e2ntico tropical. Suas quantidades, entretanto, podem variar com \n\na proximidade de ilhas, de fontes em terra e rotas de navega\u00e7\u00e3o em oceano aberto. Fragmentos pl\u00e1sticos \n\nduros foram amostrados na superf\u00edcie do mar e tamb\u00e9m nas praias arenosas, mostrando que as \u00e1guas \n\noce\u00e2nicas podem ser a fonte destes tipos de pl\u00e1sticos para as praias arenosas de ilha oce\u00e2nicas. \n\n Durante o curso deste doutorado (2010-2014), estudos espec\u00edficos sobre micropl\u00e1sticos \n\nganharam espa\u00e7o n\u00e3o s\u00f3 em revistas cient\u00edficas, muitas de alto fator de impacto, mas tamb\u00e9m em \n\noutros ve\u00edculos de informa\u00e7\u00e3o voltados ao p\u00fablico em geral. A Revista Marine Pollution Bulletin, \n\npioneira na divulga\u00e7\u00e3o de estudos sobre lixo marinho, ainda continua sendo a principal escolha dos \n\npesquisadores da \u00e1rea. Entretanto, outras revistas j\u00e1 d\u00e3o importante destaque ao tema (por exemplo, \n\nEnvironmental Pollution, Environmental Science and Technology, entre outras).  \n\n Em agosto de 2103 quando foi conclu\u00edda a revis\u00e3o da literatura sobre o tema (Cap\u00edtulo I), cerca \n\nde 130 artigos sobre micropl\u00e1sticos tinham sido publicados. Tr\u00eas meses depois, em novembro de 2013, \n\nquando o artigo foi disponibilizado no site da revista, este n\u00famero j\u00e1 atingia facilmente a marca de 150 \n\nartigos, todos publicados em revistas dispon\u00edveis no Portal de Peri\u00f3dicos da CAPES. Atualmente (maio \n\nde 2014), mais de 200 artigos sobre a presen\u00e7a e os efeitos da polui\u00e7\u00e3o por micropl\u00e1sticos j\u00e1 est\u00e3o \n\ndispon\u00edveis! Seus desdobramentos possivelmente s\u00e3o assunto para uma nova Tese de Doutorado. O \n\nreconhecimento dos esfor\u00e7os da comunidade brasileira que estuda res\u00edduos pl\u00e1sticos poderia ser feito \n\natrav\u00e9s de oportunidades de financiamento diretamente voltadas ao tema, com editais espec\u00edficos para \n\na amostragem e identifica\u00e7\u00e3o de micropl\u00e1sticos, e moderniza\u00e7\u00e3o dos laborat\u00f3rios a exemplo da Uni\u00e3o \n\nEuropeia.  \n\n Primeiramente, a confirma\u00e7\u00e3o da presen\u00e7a de micropl\u00e1sticos em importantes ambientes \n\ninsulares brasileiros exp\u00f5e a vulnerabilidade destes ambientes a este tipo de polui\u00e7\u00e3o j\u00e1 que parte das \n\nfontes de pl\u00e1sticos est\u00e3o baseadas no mar e s\u00e3o de dif\u00edcil controle, fiscaliza\u00e7\u00e3o e at\u00e9 mesmo de sua \n\nidentifica\u00e7\u00e3o precisa. Cada embarca\u00e7\u00e3o realizando as mais diversas atividades mar\u00edtimas pode ser uma \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\nfonte potencial de pl\u00e1sticos para o ambiente. Neste sentido faz-se imprescind\u00edvel o completo \n\nestabelecimento do Anexo V da Conven\u00e7\u00e3o Internacional para Preven\u00e7\u00e3o da Polui\u00e7\u00e3o por Navios \n\n(MARPOL 1973/75), endossado pelo Brasil h\u00e1 mais de 30 anos. O cen\u00e1rio atual indica, entretanto, \n\nque a MARPOL n\u00e3o vem sendo cumprida em sua totalidade. O problema \u00e9 muito amplo, englobando, \n\npor exemplo, a melhora na infraestrutura dos portos brasileiros para o recebimento adequado do lixo \n\ngerado a bordo.  \n\n Em 2014, 40 anos ap\u00f3s o estabelecimento da MARPOL, come\u00e7a a ser implementada no Brasil \n\na Pol\u00edtica Nacional dos Res\u00edduos S\u00f3lidos (PNRS), sancionada em 2010. A lei n\u00ba 12.305, de 2 de agosto \n\nde 2010, disp\u00f5e sobre a \u201cgest\u00e3o integrada e o gerenciamento de res\u00edduos s\u00f3lidos, inclu\u00eddos os \n\nperigosos, \u00e0s responsabilidades dos geradores e do poder p\u00fablico e aos instrumentos econ\u00f4micos \n\naplic\u00e1veis\u201d. D\u00e9cadas ap\u00f3s o estabelecimento de legisla\u00e7\u00f5es internacionais sobre a polui\u00e7\u00e3o marinha, \n\nque apontas as fontes baseadas em terra como respons\u00e1veis por ~80% dos pl\u00e1sticos encontrados no \n\nambiente marinho, espera-se que a\u00e7\u00f5es previstas na PNRS, ao menos, minimizem a entrada de itens \n\npl\u00e1sticos grandes nos ambientes costeiros. Isso em vista desta nova legisla\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o abordar o tema \n\nmicropl\u00e1sticos em seu texto e n\u00e3o prever a\u00e7\u00f5es espec\u00edficas neste contexto.  \n\n Dois dos ambientes insulares estudados s\u00e3o Parques Nacionais Marinhos, ou seja, Unidades de \n\nConserva\u00e7\u00e3o de prote\u00e7\u00e3o integral de categoria II definidas pelo Sistema Nacional de Unidades de \n\nConserva\u00e7\u00e3o da Natureza (SNUC) (Lei n\u00ba 9.985, de 18 de julho de 2000). Neste caso, a predomin\u00e2ncia \n\nde fontes marinhas de pl\u00e1sticos enfatiza a vulnerabilidade destes ambientes e tamb\u00e9m a falta a de \n\nefici\u00eancia das medidas de prote\u00e7\u00e3o exigidas, j\u00e1 que todos os grupos animais marinhos que comp\u00f5em \n\na teia tr\u00f3fica est\u00e3o expostos ao risco de ingest\u00e3o de micropl\u00e1sticos e suas consequ\u00eancias nos ambientes \n\nestudados. \n\n  \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\nREFER\u00caNCIAS BIBLIOGR\u00c1FICAS  \n\nAndrady, A.L., 2011.
