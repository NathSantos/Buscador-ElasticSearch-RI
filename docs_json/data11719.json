Pots of 30 cm height and 5 cm diameter \nwere fi lled with Typic Hapludox. Each pot constituted a plot of a completely randomized design, in a 7x2 \nfactorial arrangement, with four replicates. Aqueous extracts of black oat (Avena strigosa), radish (Raphanus \nsativus), corn (Zea mays), millet (Pennisetum glaucum), soybean (Glycine max), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), \nand water, as control, were added in each plot, with or without soluble phosphate fertilization. After seven days \nof incubation, soil samples were taken from soil layers at various depths, and labile, moderately labile and \nnonlabile P fractions in the soil were analysed. Plant extracts led to an accumulation of inorganic phosphorus in \nlabile and moderately labile fractions, mainly in the soil surface layer (0\u20135 cm). Radish, with a higher amount \nof malic acid and higher P content than other species, was the most effi cient in increasing soil P availability. \n\nIndex terms: Raphanus sativus, cover crops, crop rotation, labile phosphorus, low-molecular-weight organic \nacids, phosphorus fractionation. \n\n Compostos org\u00e2nicos de extratos de plantas e seus efeitos \n\nna disponibilidade de f\u00f3sforo no solo\n\nResumo \u2013 O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar o efeito de compostos org\u00e2nicos de extratos de plantas de \nseis esp\u00e9cies e da fertiliza\u00e7\u00e3o fosfatada na disponibilidade de f\u00f3sforo no solo.

Furthermore, \nP fi xation is very high in tropical soils, mainly due \nto their mineralogy (Novais &amp; Smith, 1999). The \npresence of organic compounds in rhizosphere may \nincrease or decrease nutrient availability, depending \non the characteristics of each organic compound and \n\ntheir interactions with the soil (Franchini et al., 2003; \nMoraes et al., 2007). \n\nThe study of low-molecular-weight organic acids \n(LMWOA), and the ability of their carboxylate \nfunctional groups to interact with soil, by occupying \nanion adsorption sites and competing with phosphate, \nhas an expressive importance to increase available P \nin soils (Guppy et al., 2005). The role of carboxylates, \nparticularly in relation to P availability, has been clearly \nestablished in the literature (Guppy et al., 2005); it is \n\n\n\n1380 P.S. Pavinato et al.\n\nPesq. agropec. bras., Bras\u00edlia, v.43, n.10, p.1379-1388, out. 2008\n\nregulated by organic acids concentration, number \nof carboxylate groups, soil sorption capacity, and \npersistence in soil, although many of these LMWOA \nare degraded in hours or days (Stevenson, 1967). In \ntropical acidic soils, pH change in rhizosphere and \nLMWOA presence may increase organic P solubility by \ncomplexing Fe and Al oxides, besides the competition \nfor adsorption sites promoted by the carboxylate groups \n(Sposito, 1989; Jones, 1998). \n\nThe main source of organic acids in soil is organic \nmatter decomposition, but some root and microbial \nexudates are also important. Generally, organic acids \nconcentration in soils is very low (10-3 to 10\u20135 mol L-1). \nConversely, LMWOA concentration can be high during \nresidue decomposition, immediately after its deposition \non soil surface (Stevenson, 1967). Otherwise, LMWOA \nare rapidly degraded or complexed in soil, after residues \ndeposition (hour our days) (Franchini et al., 2003). \n\nPlant species normally present root morphological \nand physiological processes for adapting to low soil \nP availability conditions, but the relative importance \nof these processes may differ among plant species \n(Gahoonia et al., 2000). Organic acids from plants \ncan increase available P by decreasing adsorption of P \nand by increasing dissolution of relatively insoluble P \ncompounds (Bolan et al., 1990), including the effect of \nroot and shoot release of LMWOA on break-up of Ca, \nFe and Al phosphates in soil.\n\nInformation about the action of LMWOA effect in \nP availability on Brazilian soils is sparse. The main \nidea to run this kind of experiment was based on works \nfrom Franchini et al. (2003) and Amaral et al. (2004), \nwhose research data showed that organic acids promote \nchanges on cations availability in soil. Information \nabout phosphorus is important for elucidating some \nfactors involving plant and soil reactions, which may \nincrease the release and P uptake from less soluble \nfractions, in soil.\n\nFractionation of P pools in soil, with various \nextractors, is an interesting way to investigate its \navailability and solubility, and to evaluate the effect \nof treatments over a short time. The P fractionation \nprocedure, developed by Hedley et al. (1982) and \nadapted by Cross &amp; Schlesinger (1995), has been one \nof the most useful procedures over the last 15 years; \nit allows the extraction of both inorganic P (Pi) and \norganic P (Po) fractions, with labile P being extracted \nfi rst, and the more resistant forms later (Gatiboni et al., \n2007). \n\nConsidering that cover crops have different amounts \nof LMWOA which can be rapidly released to soil, after \ndeposition (Stevenson, 1967; Franchini et al., 2003), \nthe objective of this study was to evaluate the effects \nof organic compounds, present in plant extracts of six \nspecies, and phosphate fertilization on soil phosphorus \navailability. \n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nThe experiment was carried out in greenhouse, \nin Botucatu, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, in 2005. The plant \nspecies used were: black oat (Avena strigosa), \nradish (Raphanus sativus), corn (Zea mays), millet \n(Pennisetum glaucum), soybean (Glycine max), and \nsorghum (Sorghum bicolor), grown for 60 days after \ngermination, when the shoot was collected. \n\nFranchini et al. (2003) reported that the amount \nof nutrients and organic acids in plant tissue changes \nwith plant age, and higher concentrations are generally \nfound in about 60-day-old plants. Plant shoots, dried in \na forced-air oven at 65\u00b0C for 72 hours, were weighed \nand ground to pass through a 0.1 cm sieve, and then \nanalysed for phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium \n(Ca), and magnesium (Mg), using wet acid digestion \nand induced coupled plasma. Nitrogen was analysed \nusing sulfuric acid digestion and distillation by micro-\nKjeldahl. Organic carbon (C) was analyzed by Walkley-\nBlack method, as described in Raij et al. (2001). Water \npH of the dry matter (1 g dry matter: 10 mL water) was \nalso determined. \n\nWater-extractable LMWOA was determined \n(Franchini et al., 2003) with some modifi cations, as \ndescribed: the extracts were obtained by horizontally \nshaking of 4 g dry matter (DM) with 100 mL distilled \nwater, at 220 rev min-1, for one hour; the solution \nwas fi ltered using a fi lter paper; 20 mL of the fi ltrate \nwere taken in triplicate, acidifi ed with HCl (pH 2.5), \nand successively extracted (three times) with 75 mL \nof ethyl acetate, by hand shaking for one minute. The \ntotal volume of ethyl acetate (approximately 225 mL) \nwas evaporated under low pressure, and then was \nreduced to 0.5\u20131.0 mL. The remaining solution was \nre-dissolved in H\n\n2\nSO\n\n4\n 0.005 mol L-1. Then, subsamples \n\nwere fi ltered using 0.45 \u00b5m nitrocellulose membrane, \nfor chromatographic injection. The analysis of \nLMWOA was carried out by high-performance liquid \nchromatography (HPLC), using an ion-exchange \ncolumn (HPX-87H, Bio-rad) with H\n\n2\nSO\n\n4\n 0.005 mol L-1 \n\n\n\nPlant extract effect on soil phosphorus availability 1381\n\nPesq. agropec. bras., Bras\u00edlia, v.43, n.10, p.1379-1388, out. 2008\n\nas mobile phase. The fl ow rate was 0.6 mL min-1, and \n\ndetection was performed at 210 nm. The identifi cation \n\nand quantifi cation of organic compounds were carried \n\nout for time retention, and the area of spectra was \n\ncompared to the one of reference standards.\n\nPots were made of PVC tubes (5 cm diameter and \n\n30 cm long), with the capacity 0.65 kg of dry soil. The \n\nsoil chosen for this experiment was a Typic Hapludox \n\n(Soil Survey Staff, 1999), with 222 g kg-1 clay; \n\n40 g kg-1 silt and 738 g kg-1 sand, with the following \n\nchemical characteristics (Raij et al., 2001): pH CaCl\n2\n, \n\n5.60; OM, 24.7 g dm-3; resin-P, 4.6 mg dm-3; with 0.7, \n\n33 and 13.3 mmol\nc\n dm-3 K, Ca, and Mg, respectively; \n\nand 72% base saturation. The soil was homogeneously \n\ncompacted inside the tube, to simulate fi eld conditions. \n\nA net was fi xed at the tube bottom to prevent soil loss. \n\nEach pot constituted a plot.\n\nPlant extracts were obtained in a similar way \n\nfor organic acid analysis, by shaking 4 g DM with \n\n100 mL of distilled water at 220 rev min-1 for one hour. \n\nThen, the solutions were fi ltered using a fi lter paper. \n\nThe treatments consisted of plant fi ltered extracts \n\napplication, equivalent to 20 Mg ha-1 of dry matter, \n\nwhich corresponded to 87 mL of extract in each plot. It \n\nis important to emphasize that this amount is similar to \n\nthe expected one to be released by harvested and cover \n\ncrops in a two-year crop rotation, but in the present \n\nwork the extracts were applied in a few minutes, in \n\norder to maximize the possible effects of LMWOA in \n\nsoil. The amount applied was much higher than that \n\nfrom residues decomposition, but this amount was \n\nadopted based on the possibility to rapidly measure the \n\neffects, and based on literature research about nutrient \n\navailability under plant residues deposition (Franchini \n\net al., 2003; Amaral et al., 2004; Moraes et al., 2007). \n\nThe treatments used were: black oat, millet, corn, \n\nradish, soybean, sorghum, and distilled water, as \n\ncontrol, with the chemical characteristics described in \n\nTable 1. These seven treatments were conducted with \n\nand without phosphate fertilization using, as P source, \n\nsimple superphosphate (100 kg ha-1 of P) applied in soil \n\nsurface, immediately before plant extracts application, \n\ntotalizing fourteen treatments. Soil columns were \n\npreviously wet and soil humidity was kept close \n\nto water fi eld capacity, throughout the seven-day \n\nexperiment. Plastic fi lm inside the PVC tube was used \n\nfor a better contact between soil and tube, and to avoid \n\npreferential water fl ux through the internal surface of \n\nthe column. The 87 mL of the extract applied to each \n\nplot contained nutrients in the quantities shown in \n\nTable 1. Temperature inside the greenhouse, during the \n\nseven-day experiment, was from 22 to 32\u00baC.\n\nAfter one hour of plant extracts application, the \n\nsolution that percolated through the soil column was \n\ncollected. The amount percolated was approximately \n\n80 mL in each column, almost all the extract volume \n\nadded. A similar collect was repeated on the seventh \n\nday after extract application. By this time, 50 mL of \n\ndistilled water was applied, and approximately 40 mL \n\nof the percolated solution was collected in each \n\ncolumn. The solutions were analyzed for P, K, Ca, and \n\nMg, by inductive couple plasma. On the seventh day, \n\nthe columns were destroyed and the soil samples were \n\ntaken in the layers of 0\u20135, 5\u201310, 10\u201315 e 15\u201330 cm. \n\nSoil samples were oven-dried at 65\u00baC for 48 hours, \n\nground, and sieved (0.2 cm). \n\nPhosphorus pools in soil were determined in soil \n\nsamples, using P fractionation (Hedley et al., 1982), \n\nwith some modifi cations (Cross &amp; Schlesinger, 1995) as \n\nfollows: sequential extraction by anion-exchange resin, \n\n0.5 mol L-1 NaHCO\n3\n, 0.1 mol L-1 NaOH, 1 mol L-1 HCl, \n\n0.5 mol L-1 NaOH and residual digestion with HCl + \n\nHNO\n3\n + H\n\n2\nSO\n\n4\n. Inorganic and residual P fractions were \n\nanalyzed using blue molybdate-ascorbic acid (Murphy \n\n&amp; Riley, 1962). The organic fractions extracted by \n\n0.5 mol L-1 NaHCO\n3\n, 0.1 mol L-1 NaOH and 0.5 mol L-1 \n\nTable 1.

And then, the organic P was measured in the \nsame way as described in case of inorganic P.\n\nThe experimental design was a 7x2 factorial with \n4 replicates. ANOVA was carried out using SAS 8.2 \n(SAS Institute, 2001), and means were compared using \nthe t test, at 5% probability. \n\nResults and Discussion\n\nEach plant species had a different nutrient content in \nshoot dry matter (Table 1). Soybean and radish presented \nhigher contents of N, P, K, and Ca. Consequently, these \nplant species were able to return a higher amount of \nthese nutrients to soil, when their extracts were applied, \nleading to a higher nutrient availability. The maximum \namount of P applied via plant extract (radish) was \n5.9 mg per soil column. The amounts of K were high \nin all the plant extracts, and the amounts of Ca and Mg \nadded via extracts were considered low, compared to \nthe original soil contents. \n\nThere was a large variation in organic acid contents \namong species, and some acids were very specifi c to \neach plant species (Figure 1). Radish had the highest \nquantity of malic and oxalic acids, which explain the \nhighest quantity of total accumulated LMWOA of \n275 mmol\n\nc\n kg-1 of DM. Soybean presented the lowest \n\ncontent of LMWOA, with a total accumulated of \n44 mmol\n\nc\n kg-1, with predominance of succinic acid. In \n\nall crops, citric, t-aconitic, and acetic acids were found \npredominantly in black oat, millet, corn, and sorghum. \nAccordingly, radish extract could play an important \nrole in increasing soil nutrient availability, since this \ncrop normally presents high amount of malic acid \nand other LMWOA in plant tissue (Franchini et al., \n2003; Moraes et al., 2007). In a similar study, Amaral \net al. (2004) observed that citric and malic acids are \npredominat in radish tissue. \n\nThe type and amount of carboxylates from organic \ncompounds produced or accumulated by plants are \nresponsible for different interactions with soil nutrients, \npromoting adsorption and complexation reactions \n(Jones, 1998; Guppy et al., 2005). Monocarboxylic \norganic acids, such as acetic acid, have a limited effect \nin competing with ions for adsorption sites in soil. \nConversely, malic and citric acids, which present two \nand three carboxylates, respectively, plus additional \n\nhydroxyl groups, are stronger competitors for soil \nadsorption sites (Guppy et al., 2005). Otherwise, \nsome LMWOA may promote changes in soil physical \nproperties, like penetration resistance and water \ndisperse clay content, as mentioned by Correa et al. \n(2008), who evaluated the application of citric and \noxalic acids in soil.\n\nDespite the high amounts of LMWOA applied \nthrough plant extracts, they were not detected in \nsolution percolated through the soil columns, analysed \nby HPLC, possibly due to a rapid interaction with soil \ncolloids, retention in soil functional groups (clay and \noxides), or degradation by microorganisms in soil (van \nHees et al., 2005; Moraes et al., 2007). Similar results \nwere found by Amaral et al. (2004), after the application \nof black oat and radish residues in soil. However, Pires \net al. (2007) found a reasonable quantity of organic \nacids in the leachates, but only when the rhizosphere \nzone solution was extracted from the soil, which \nrevealed the presence of acetic, lactic and oxalic acids \nand trace concentrations of butyric, citric, fumaric, \ngluconic, malic, succinic, and tartaric acids.\n\nThe nutrient percolations were very low compared \nwith the amounts applied, and there was no effect \nof P fertilization on nutrients percolation from plant \nextracts through the soil columns, in both (0 and 7 days) \nsolution samplings (Tables 2 and 3). One hour after \nextract application, P, K, and Ca percolation through \nsoil columns seemed to be inhibited by the presence of \nplant extracts, since the leached nutrient content was \nhigher in water control than in treatments (Table 2). \n\nOxalic Citric Maleic Malic t-aconitic Succinic Acetic Fumaric Sum total\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nBlack oat\nMillet\nCorn\nRadish\nSoybean\nSorghum\n\n(m\nm\n\no\nl\n\nk\ng\n\nD\nM\n\n)\nc\n\n-1\n\nFigure 1.

Millet and radish were the most effective \nspecies in reducing P concentration in the leached \nsolution, in both samplings (0 and 7 days), possibly \ndue to complexation between organic compounds from \nplant residues and phosphate, in soil profi le (Gahoonia \net al., 2000).\n\nAlthough phosphorus was the focus of the \nwork, some important cations were also evaluated \nin percolated solution. Potassium, calcium, and \nmagnesium concentrations in leached solution were \nconsiderably increased after seven days, for all plant \nextracts (Table 3), when compared to the solution \ncollected one hour after application. This increment \nwas attributed to the amount of K, Ca, and Mg applied \nvia plant extract (Table 1), which, after seven days, \nwere available in soil solution and were susceptible \nto leaching. Otherwise, interactions among organic \ncarboxylates and soil cations could favour ion binding \nto soil colloids, which could be a consequence of \nreduced leaching in some plant species.\n\nThe extracts of all species led to an increase in resin-\nextractable P in the 0\u20135-cm layer, with radish and \nsoybean showing the highest increase (Figure 2 A). \n\nThe amount of P present in radish and soybean extracts \n(Table 1) contributed to a large extent for the increment \nobserved in available P in soil, since 5.9 and 4.6 mg of \nP were applied to those columns, respectively. If most \nof this P remain in the surface layer, the increment in \navailable P could be signifi cant. Following this idea, \nliterature information shows that high amounts of \nmalic acid and total LMWOA present in plant extracts \naffect P availability, reacting and promoting complex \nformation between phosphate and organic compounds \nin soil (Gahoonia et al., 2000). \n\nIn general, grass species presented lesser potential \nto make P available than soybean and radish, in surface \nlayer 0\u20135 cm (Figure 2 A). However, in deeper layers, \nthere was no effect of plant extracts on P availability. \nWhen phosphate fertilizer was applied, plant extracts \npresented potential to immobilize P, reducing its \navailability, when compared to control treatment, \npossibly by a complexation between carboxylates \nand phosphate (Figure 2 B) mentioned in literature \n(Gahoonia et al., 2000). This complexation was more \nevident in the 0\u20135 and 5\u201310-cm soil layers, highlighted \nwhen grass extracts were used. \n\nThe inorganic P extracted by bicarbonate \n(0.5 mol L-1 NaHCO\n\n3\n) was increased in all soil depths \n\nwith all extracts, but the increase was signifi cant only \nin the 0\u20135 and 5\u201310-cm layers (Figure 2 C), similarly \n\nPlant extract P K Ca Mg\n\n(\u00b5g L\n-1\n\n) --------------(mg L\n-1\n)-------------\n\nWithout P application\n\nBlack oat 0.22 10.1 18.5 15.8\n\nMillet 0.12 9.9 19.3 15.9\n\nCorn 0.18 9.5 18.0 14.5\n\nRadish 0.13 9.3 19.4 15.8\n\nSoybean 0.12 9.5 18.5 14.7\n\nSorghum 0.31 10.0 19.4 16.1\n\nWater 0.64 21.8 47.2 16.0\n\nLSD\n(1)\n\n0.24 2.0 2.4 ns\n\nWith application of 100 kg ha of P\n-1\n\nBlack oat 0.25 9.3 18.5 15.4\n\nMillet 0.14 9.6 19.7 16.5\n\nCorn 0.10 9.4 19.6 16.4\n\nRadish 0.20 9.3 18.9 15.8\n\nSoybean 0.13 10.6 19.1 15.7\n\nSorghum 0.14 9.1 19.4 15.3\n\nWater 0.57 20.8 44.5 15.3\n\nLSD 0.12 1.9 5.1 ns\n\nTable 2.

Taking into account all the previous fractions, \nplant extracts seem to be acting as chelating agents, \nmaintaining P in forms less available in soil. However, \nthis P cannot be considered unavailable over a long \nterm, as it can become available as soon as the solution \nP is depleted (Novais &amp; Smyth, 1999; Gahoonia et al., \n2000). When phosphate fertilizer was applied, the \namount of inorganic P in this fraction was signifi cantly \nincreased, in all soil layers (Figure 3 B), which indicates \nthat the total P applied via fertilizer does not remain \nonly in labile forms in soil, and may also be part of the \nmoderately available fraction.\n\nOrganic P extracted by 0.1 mol L-1 NaOH allowed \nno conclusive discussion (Figure 3 C and D). Similar \nresults for both organic and inorganic P extracted by \n0.1 mol L-1 NaOH were obtained by Gatiboni (2003) \nand Gatiboni et al. (2007), in clayey soils from \nSouthern Brazil. Organic compounds present in plant \nextracts reduced the organic available P, extracted by \nbicarbonate, possibly by complexation of phosphate \nor by formation of organo-metallic bonds (Gahoonia \net al., 2000; Guppy et al., 2005). Other experiments \nshowed that P applied as fertilizer or from plant and \nanimal manure normally promotes accumulation of P \nin inorganic fractions in soil, with small or no changes \nin organic P availability (Friesen et al., 1997; Gatiboni, \n2003).\n\nThe fraction of inorganic P extracted by 1 mol L-1 \nHCl was affected by plant extracts in almost all \nsoil layers, which promoted higher values than the \ncontrol, with small differences between plant species \n(Figure 3 E). When fertilizer was applied, signifi cant \nincrement in P extracted by HCl was observed in \nalmost all soil layers, similarly as without fertilizer, \nalthough the fertilizer promoted increments in this P \nfraction only at 0\u20135-cm layer (Figure 3 F).\n\nThe extraction of inorganic P by 0.5 mol L-1 NaOH \nwas similar to those obtained for 0.1 mol L-1 NaOH, \nwith higher values in the presence of plant extracts, \npointing to a possible P immobilization of available \nfractions, as a result of extracts applied, although \nmost data were not signifi cant (Figure 4 A and B). \nThe organic P fraction presented a wide variation \namong treatments and depths, turning diffi cult any \nclear conclusion (Figure 4 C and D). No effect of \nphosphate fertilizer was observed on P fractions \nextracted by NaOH 0.5 mol L-1, which followed \nthe same behaviour observed in data presented by \nGatiboni et al. (2007).\n\nResidual P fraction remained stable with the \napplication of plant extracts and fertilizer (Figure 4 E \nand F). No signifi cant difference was observed \nbetween plant extracts, although it was possible to \ndetect some variations in soil profi le. The residual \nfraction accounted for approximately 60% of total \nP present in soil; similar results were obtained by \nGatiboni et al. (2007). These authors studied a clayey \nsoil in Southern Brazil, and mentioned that although \nthe residual amount was high, even this fraction may \nbe depleted after successive cultivated crops without \nfertilizer, which shows that residual P can become \navailable when a long time frame is considered.\n\nConsidering all data from P fractionation, there \nwas an increase in labile pool, which could be a \nconsequence of the quantity added via plant extract \nor of the interaction between organic compounds and \nsoil, being more expressive with soybean and radish \nextracts. However, when inorganic P was applied, \nin the form of fertilizer, plant extracts seemed to \nimmobilize P, complexing it with organic compounds \nand retaining it in less available forms (Gahoonia \net al., 2000). Although the inorganic labile P was \nincreased by application of plant extracts, the highest \nincrease was observed in inorganic moderately \nlabile P. Considering these labile and moderately labile \nfractions together, it seems that plant extracts maked \nP less available immediately after addition to the \nsoil but, possibly, it may turn available later, as soil/\nsolution reactions occur. The increase in moderately \nlabile P pool could be considered a positive aspect \nin a long term, because, supposedly, as soon as the \navailable pool is depleted, the less available pool can \nbecome available.\n\nEvaluating all data from Hedley fractionation, it is \npossible to infer that the addition of plant extracts increased \nmost of the inorganic soil P fractions, without signifi cant \nchanges in organic fractions. However, it is important to \nemphasize that the amount of plant extract applied was \nmuch higher than what normally occurs in cultivated \nareas. The observed changes were more evident in the \nsurface layer 0\u20135 cm, which may be in part attributed to the \namount applied via plant extracts. Small changes were also \nobserved in deeper layers, such as 5\u201310 and 10\u201315 cm.\n\nMany studies have demonstrated the effect of \nLMWOA on the availability of soil nutrient (Franchini \net al., 2003; Amaral et al., 2004; Moraes et al., 2007). \nHowever, in most of them, high rates of LMWOA \n\n\n\nPlant extract effect on soil phosphorus availability 1387\n\nPesq. agropec. bras., Bras\u00edlia, v.43, n.10, p.1379-1388, out. 2008\n\nand high rates of fertilizers were used, which is not \nobserved in farms. In the present study, the amount of \nplant extracts applied were equivalent to a two-year \ncrop rotation (about 20 Mg ha-1 of DM), but the \nextracts were applied in a short time in soil columns. \n\nThis fact makes the extrapolation to fi eld conditions \ndiffi cult, since in these conditions soil reaction and \nmicrobial activity are slower, and the results would \npossibly be different from the obtained in greenhouse \npots.\n\nInorganic P by NaOH 0.5M (mg kg )\n-1\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\n\n(ns)\n\n(ns)\n\n(A)\n\nBlack oat\n\nMillet\n\nCorn\n\nRadish\n\nSoybean\n\nSorghum\n\nWater\n\nInorganic P by NaOH 0.5M (mg kg\n-1\n)\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\n\n(ns)\n\n(ns)\n\n(ns)\n\n(B)\n\nBlack oat\n\nMillet\n\nCorn\n\nRadish\n\nSoybean\n\nSorghum\n\nWater\n\nOrganic P by NaOH 0.5M (mg kg\n-1\n)\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\n\n(ns)\n\n(C)\n\nBlack oat\n\nMillet\n\nCorn\n\nRadish\n\nSoybean\n\nSorghum\n\nWater\n\nOrganic P by NaOH 0.5M (mg kg\n-1\n)\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\n\n(ns)\n\n(ns)\n\n(ns)\n\n(D)\n\nBlack oat\n\nMillet\n\nCorn\n\nRadish\n\nSoybean\n\nSorghum\n\nWater\n\nResidual P (mg kg\n-1\n)\n\n200 250 300 350 400 450\n\n0 5\n_\n\n5 10\n_\n\n10 15\n_\n\n15 30\n_\n\n0 5\n_\n\n5 10\n_\n\n10 15\n_\n\n15 30\n_\n\n0 5\n_\n\n5 10\n_\n\n10 15\n_\n\n15 30\n_\n\nBlack oat\n\nMillet\n\nCorn\n\nRadish\n\nSoybean\n\nSorghum\n\nWater\n\n(ns)\n\n(ns)\n\n(ns)\n\n(ns)\n\n(E)\n\nResidual P (mg kg\n-1\n)\n\n200 250 300 350 400 450\n\n0 5\n_\n\n5 10\n_\n\n10 15\n_\n\n15 30\n_\n\n0 5\n_\n\n5\n_\n\n10\n\n10 15\n_\n\n15 30\n_\n\n0 5\n_\n\n5 10\n_\n\n10 15\n_\n\n15 30\n_\n\nBlack oat\n\nMillet\n\nCorn\n\nRadish\n\nSoybean\n\nSorghum\n\nWater\n\n(ns)\n\n(ns)\n\n(ns)\n\n(ns)\n\n(F)\n\nD\ne\np\n\nth\n l\n\na\ny\n\ne\nr \n\n(c\nm\n\n)\nD\n\ne\np\n\nth\n l\n\na\ny\n\ne\nr \n\n(c\nm\n\n)\nD\n\ne\np\n\nth\n l\n\na\ny\n\ne\nr \n\n(c\nm\n\n)\n\nD\ne\np\n\nth\n l\n\na\ny\n\ne\nr \n\n(c\nm\n\n)\nD\n\ne\np\n\nth\n l\n\na\ny\n\ne\nr \n\n(c\nm\n\n)\nD\n\ne\np\n\nth\n l\n\na\ny\n\ne\nr \n\n(c\nm\n\n)\n\nFigure 4.
