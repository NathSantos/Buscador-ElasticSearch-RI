However, it has also been considered in numerical solvers which rely on structured mesh. Several issues appear when using structured mesh in curved shaped geometries (fairly common in chemical process areas). The current work is based on a novel modelling of the geometry relying on unstructured mesh and porosity distributed resistance approach. The modeling is implemented in a fully 3D Navier-Stokes compressible formulation. Combustion is treated using a laminar flamelet approach based on the Bray, Moss and Libby (BML) formulation.

Onshore and offshore facilities may contain large amounts of flammable fuels which, if a release occurs, may form a gas cloud which can ignite yielding serious consequences. The effects might be worse where the industrial site is more confined or congested. The greater the presence of obstacles, the higher the overpressure will be.\nIn the numerical simulation of explosion phenomena, the influence of small scale geometry is of paramount importance as it contributes to the turbulent field ahead of the flame front. The proper resolution of the large geometry, commonly resolved in the mesh is also important as it will shape the main flow. The present work suggests a modeling that covers the best of the two worlds within a feasible computational time required by the industry. Large objects are represented in an unstructured mesh that helps to overcome the limitations of the Cartesian systems in irregular geometries. Additional, small scale geometry is parameterized via porosity using an in-house code, namely PorTool (developed for unstructured mesh).\nGoverning equations\nThe explosion phenomena have been modelled using the principle of conservation applied to mass, momentum, energy, mass fraction of fuel, mixture fraction, turbulent kinetic energy and the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy. Analysis of the differential equations describing the conservation laws for these quantities indicates that the variables obey a generalised equation, in\nd(p(p) dfpUjCp)\t6\t( ~s, (1) I J\ndt\tdXj\tdXj\t\nWhere:\nrf = Turbulent exchange coefficient; f = Dependent variable (p, ui , E, c, f , k, s);\nSf = Corresponding source term.\nThis equation is discretised by integration over a tetrahedral cell, and Gauss's theorem is used to convert volume integrals into surface integrals corresponding to the convective and diffusive flows of each variable through each face of the cell.\nThe formulation solves the fully three dimensional, compressible, Favre averaged, Navier-Stokes equations. Equations are solved explicitly, using a spatially second order accurate, finite volume Jameson scheme (Jameson and Baker, 1987), with four step Runge-Kutta time advancement. The description of the MPDR approach is discussed in the next section. Further details of the numerical scheme and the solver can be found elsewhere (Darwes, 1992a, 1992b; Cant et al., 2004).\nModified distributed porosity modelling\nThe modified porosity distributed resistance (MPDR) approach presented here differs from previous formulations suggested by Patankar and Spalding in the way that the porosity is calculated. First, a complete continuous unstructured triangular surface mesh is created over the geometry of interest. A tetrahedral volume mesh is then constructed based on the surface mesh. This is done automatically, using an in-house mesh generation tool called 3DGeo which also comprises the surface and volume mesh generator. In each tetrahedron, a total of four nodes is used to build up the cell. In order to calculate the volume and area porosity for the CFD code, an auxiliary code named Porosity Tool (PorTool), (Vianna and Cant, 2010) has been developed. The code also calculates the turbulence-like porosity factor used in the turbulence modelling, which deals with the turbulence production caused by the non--resolved obstacles. In theory, the turbulence factor is represented by equation 2 below. This factor produces a significant enhancement in the turbulence production as the porosity is reduced. This factor is found in the extra source of turbulence described later within this section.\nWhere:\n(2)\nP = Porosity\nPorTool reads a complete geometry file as produced by 3DGeo, and applies a user-defined cut off size for the geometry. The filtered geometry is then meshed. The\nporosity value is calculated for the cells in which the nodes coincide with the coordinates of the filtered geometry. This constitutes an impaired region, in which the porosity value ranges from a pre-set minimum figure up to unity, corresponding respectively to cells which are almost fully blocked to those which are completely unblocked. Fully blocked cells are not considered in the modelling. The reason is that a fully blocked cell (porosity equal to zero) would represent an object resolved in the mesh. In this case it is more accurate to resolve the object rather than model it. It is also important to emphasise that a porosity value equal to zero would generate an infinite amount of turbulence as stated in equation 2. Note that as the porosity goes to zero the F factor goes to infinite. Computationally it would be a division by zero and coding difficulties would appear. This matter is overcome by the pre-set minimum porosity value which guarantees the physical meaning to the extra source of turbulence.\nThe porosity value in the PorTool is defined by the nodes that are found to lie within an impaired region. These nodes are tagged, and based on the number of elements tagged within each cell, the value of the area porosity pi is calculated for each face as a function of the geometry, mesh size and number of nodes. If for example, two nodes that build up the cell are tagged, then a porosity value of 0.5 is attributed to this particular computational cell. As the volume of the cell is calculated via the cell face areas, the volume porosity value pv is consistent with the cell face porosities.\nThe mesh is controlled by two sets of parameters in the surface and volume mesh tool prior to the PorTool procedure. The first set is global and comprises the following main inputs; maximum spacing, the minimum spacing, the curvature limit and the rate of spacing increase. The second set, which is local to each patch is specified in the boundary condition file. These two sets of parameters are going to determine the size and quality of the surface mesh. Figure 1a shows the original geometry and figure 1b shows the parameterized version used in this study.\nEquation 3 below is the momentum equation augmented by the resistance term R. This source term concerns the resistance imposed to the flow by the obstacles modelled\nFigure 1 - British Gas geometry; (a) original geometry with 20 pipes; (b) porous geometry obtained with PorTool.\nFigura 1 - Geometria de British Gas; (a) geometria original con 20 tubos; (b) geometr\u00eda porosa obteni-da con PorTool.\nFigura 1 - Geometr\u00eda de British Gas; (a) geometr\u00eda original con 20 tubos; (b) geometr\u00eda porosa obteni-da con PorTool.\nvia the porosity approach.

The surface is then stretched and transported by the turbulence.

During an explosion there will be a laminar phase of combustion in which the flame propagates relatively slowly in a quasi-laminar manner, followed by a turbulent phase. During the turbulent phase, the reaction rate source term is modelled using the flame surface area approach.

In all cases, special attention was given to confinement and congestion, which are particular characteristics of the industrial process environment, especially in offshore installations. A set of 2D simulations was concentrated mainly on non-reacting flows, although a reacting flow case was also carried out. The main focus here was to verify how well the modelling was able to reproduce the turbulent flow and combustion in an environment representative of explosion scenarios. On the other hand, the 3D test cases were concentrated on reacting flows. Some classical test cases used in previous work for the validation of explosion models were reconsidered.\n2D flows\nThe first test case compared the numerical results obtained when the geometry was fully resolved using an unstructured grid with numerical findings calculated using the modified porosity approach. In the case where the geometry was parameterized, the nine obstructions represented by set of circles indicate a group of pipes, and are fully represented by porosities.\nFigure 2a compares the results obtained using the MPDR approach (labelled McUNEWT-MPDR) with those where the pipes were fully resolved on the mesh (labelled NEWT). It is clear that the MPDR model is able to reproduce to a high level of accuracy the same flow as that calculated when the pipes are fully resolved on the mesh. The model shows little dependence on mesh size for the range of mesh sizes considered (fig. 2b). Figure 3 shows the velocity field downstream of the set of obstacles for the case in which the pipes are fully resolved in the grid (fig. 3a), and the case where the pipes are parameterized through porosity figure 3b. The higher velocity stream in between in the pipes is captured satisfactorily. However, the model is not able to predict the wake velocity immediately downstream of the obstacles.\nFigure 2 - Numerical simulations using the modified porosity approach; (a) velocity comparison between the case with the geometry fully resolved and the parameterized geometry.\nFigura 2 - Simula\u00e7\u00f5es num\u00e9ricas mediante abordagem de porosidade modificada; (a) compara\u00e7\u00e3o de velocidade entre o caso da geometria totalmente resolvida e a geometria parametrizada.\nFigura 2 - Simulaciones num\u00e9ricas mediante enfoque de porosidad modificada; (A) comparaci\u00f3n de velocidad entre el caso de la geometria totalmente resuelta y la geometria parametrizada.\nFigure 3 - Velocity field for the 2D test case; (a) geometry is fully resolved; (b) geometry is represented by porosity within unstructured mesh.\nFigura 3 - Campo de velocidad para el caso de la prueba 2D; (a) geometria totalmente resuelta; (b) geometria representada por porosidad en el interior de la malla no estructurada.\nFigura 3 - Campo de velocidade para o caso do teste 2D; (a) geometria totalmente resolvida; (b) geometria representada por porosidade no interior da malha n\u00e3o estruturada.\nThe numerical results obtained using MPDR are also compared with experimental data as reported by CMR (Birkby et al., 1999). Velocity is calculated downstream of two obstacle sets in different experiments; the first one with five pipes and the second one with a single pipe. Findings are presented in figure 4. Figure 4a shows the velocity field for the case with 5 pipes while figure 4 b shows the findings for the case with a single pipe. A more quantitative analysis of the simulation is shown in figure 4c and d, where the velocity is compared with experimental data for the case with 5 pipes and the case with a single pipe, respectively. Analysis of the plot shows close agreement with reasonable over-prediction in the wake of the obstacles.\n3D flows\nThe reacting flow cases were modelled and compared with three experiments performed by British Gas, Shell and Det Norske Veritas. All cases considered boxes with a set of pipes in it. The differences among the experiments lay in the size of the venting opening, the fuel and the shape of obstacles (square section and cylindrical section). The British Gas test cases consist of a 9m long box with cross section 4.5 x 4.5m and pipe diameter of 18cm. The box is filled with methane and ignition is centre located at the wall opposite the vented wall (vent area 2.25m2). The SOLVEX test case is a 10m long box, 8.75m wide and 6.26m high. Pipe diameter is 50cm and rows are staggered. Ignition is centre located at the wall opposite the vented end (vent area 27.13m2).\nFigure 4 - Experimental data comparison; (a) velocity field for the case with five pipes; (b) velocity field for the case with one pipe; (c) experimental data comparison with numerical findings for the case with 5 pipes; (d) experimental data comparison with numerical findings for the case with 1 pipe.\nFigura 4 - Compara\u00e7\u00e3o entre dados experimentais; (a) campo de velocidade para o caso com cinco tubos; (b) campo de velocidade para o caso com um tubo; (c) compara\u00e7\u00e3o entre dados experimentais com resultados num\u00e9ricos para o caso com cinco tubos; (d) compara\u00e7\u00e3o entre dados experimentais com resultados num\u00e9ricos para o caso com um tubo.\nFigura 4 - Comparaci\u00f3n entre los datos experimentales; (a) campo de velocidad para el caso con cinco tubos; (b) campo de velocidad para el caso con un tubo; (c) comparaci\u00f3n entre datos experimentales con resultados num\u00e9ricos para el caso con cinco tubos; (d) comparaci\u00f3n entre datos experimentales con resultados num\u00e9ricos para el caso con un tubo.\nDnV experiments have a volume of 35m3 with a vent opening positioned on one side wall only. The vent parameter, A/V 2/3 varies from 0.33 to 0.82. A is the area of the wall where the vent is placed and V is the volume of the module. Four rows of pipes (11cm) or square cross section obstacles (12.5cm) are placed as an internal obstruction. This test case is particularly interesting as it emphasizes the different effects produced by square beams when compared with pipes. The drag coefficients for pipes are not the same as for obstructions with square cross sections and therefore different drag forces and turbulence generation are expected. Consequently, it would affect the flame speed and ultimately the pressure.\nFigures 5a and 5b shows the progress variable propagation in two instants of time. The plot is a section through a central plane of figure 1. Figure 5c compares the excess\npressure prediction with experimental data for a different number of pipes in the box.\nFigure 6a shows the excess pressure prediction for the SOLVEX test case using Methane while figure 6b addresses Propane as a fuel. Both plots present results for three configurations. Two rows of pipes in the box, one row located closer to ignition (rear) and one row located further from ignition (front). Analysis of figure 6 shows close agreement with experimental data.\nDnV results are presented together with British Gas and Shell data in figure 7. The x-axis shows experimental data and the y-axis shows numerical findings. The solid line in the plot represents the identity function and the dashed line is the tolerance interval of 42%. Analysis of figure 7 shows that the code developed based on the MPDR approach is\nFigure 5 - British Gas test case; (a) section cut on xy-plane showing the progress variable right after ignition; (b) section cut on xy-plane showing the progress after 900% consumption of fuel; (c) experimental data comparison with numerical findings for all arrangements.\nMobil - British Gas\nMethane\nFigura 5 - Caso de teste British Gas;\n(a)\tsec\u00e7\u00e3o em plano xy que demonstra a vari\u00e1vel de progresso logo ap\u00f3s a igni\u00e7\u00e3o;\n(b)\tsec\u00e7\u00e3o em plano xy que demonstra\no progresso ap\u00f3s consumo de 90% do combust\u00edvel; (c) compara\u00e7\u00e3o entre dados experimentais com resultados num\u00e9ricos para todas as combina\u00e7\u00f5es.\nFigura 5 - Caso de prueba British Gas;\n(a)\tsecci\u00f3n en plano xy que muestra la variable de progreso inmediatamente des-pu\u00e9s de la ignici\u00f3n;\n(b)\tsecci\u00f3n en plan xy que demuestra el progreso despu\u00e9s del consumo del 900% del combustible; (c) comparaci\u00f3n entre datos experimentales con resultados num\u00e9ricos para todas las combinaciones.\nSOL VEX\nMethane\nSOLVEX\nPropane\nFigure 6 - SOLVEX experimental data comparison; (a) simulations using Methane as fuel;\n(b) simulation using Propane as fuel.\nConclusions\nA novel procedure for modelling of turbulent reacting flow is proposed. The study focused on explosion modelling. The modelling is implemented in an unstructured mesh in-house flow solver. Computed values of peak pressure are compared with experimental data for three different explosion test cases. Overall agreement is good. The modelling has shown to be fairly robust. The great advantage of the model is to rely on unstructured mesh to resolve the geometry that is not filtered. This approach is expected to be more accurate than structured mesh modelling, particularly when curved geometry is\nFigura 6 - Compara\u00e7\u00e3o entre dados experimentais SOL-VEX; (a) simula\u00e7\u00f5es com o uso de Metano como combust\u00edvel; (b) simula\u00e7\u00e3o com o uso de Propano como combust\u00edvel.\nFigura 6 - Compara-ci\u00f3n entre los datos experimentales SOL-VEX; (a) simulaciones con el uso de Metano como combustible; (b) simulaci\u00f3n con el uso de Propano como combustible.\nable to predict explosion calculations within a confidence interval of around 40% as far as the experimental data used in this study is concerned.\n100 -\n\u2014 Predicted = Experiment\n.. 95% confidence interval (+ - 42%) 0 SOLVEX\n* Mobil - British Gas\nx DNV\nc\u00fa -\n10000 -\n1 ...... 100 10000\nExperimental peak pressure (mbar)\nFigure 7 - Experimental data comparison for all cases: X-axis is the experimental data, Y-axis is the excess pressure prediction.
