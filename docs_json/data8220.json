With appropriate data inversion \n\nprocedures it is possible to obtain resistivity values from a few tens of meters to hundreds of \n\nkilometers. As with all geophysical prospecting methods, the MT method is subject to \n\nambiguities because of the resistivity dispersion phenomenon. This phenomenon might \n\ndeform the MT response curves and can lead to erroneous interpretation. \n\nA general conclusion is that the dispersion effects can influence the MT response either in \n\nrecognizable or in subtle forms. In both cases, disregarding the distortion effects may lead to \n\nmisleading conclusions as to the physical properties of the surveyed structures. \n\nThis work deals with different aspects of the magnetotelluric method. First of all the \n\nresistivity dispersion is treated theoretically performing, for the first time, simulations over a \n\n3-D Earth model (1-D case is reported from a previous work of Esposito and Patella, 2009 \n\nand 2-D case is reconstructed basing the simulation on a previous work of Mauriello et al., \n\n1996) with a case study in a geothermal area as example (Snake River Plain, Idaho, USA). It \n\nis shown an MT application in the Pec\u00e9m costal area (Cear\u00e1, Brazil), disregarding the \n\nresistivity dispersion, in order to show the efficiency of the method in solving subsurface \n\nresistivity contrasts and finally theoretical simulations showing the application of the MT \n\nmethod for Oil and Gas in the emerged portion of Potiguar Basin (Rio Grande do Norte, \n\nBrazil) are performed, in order to consider the MT as a support in areas where the seismic, \n\nmainly used for these purposes, can be logistically hard to apply or needs a comparison with \n\nother geophysical prospecting methods. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Resistivity dispersion. Magnetotelluric response. 3D structures. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n!\n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\nRESUMO \n!\nO M\u00e9todo magnetotel\u00farico permite a determina\u00e7\u00e3o da distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de resistividade el\u00e9trica na \n\nsubsuperf\u00edcie, a fim de diferenciar as estruturas presentes. Com os procedimentos de invers\u00e3o \n\nde dados \u00e9 poss\u00edvel obter valores de resistividade de algumas dezenas de metros at\u00e9 centenas \n\nde quil\u00f3metros. Como acontece com todos os m\u00e9todos de prospec\u00e7\u00e3o geof\u00edsica, o m\u00e9todo MT \n\nest\u00e1 sujeito a ambiguidades por causa do fen\u00f4meno da dispers\u00e3o da resistividade. Este \n\nfen\u00f3meno pode deformar as curvas de resposta MT e pode conduzir a uma interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nerr\u00f3nea. \n\nUma conclus\u00e3o geral \u00e9 que os efeitos de dispers\u00e3o pode influenciar a resposta MT em forma \n\nreconhec\u00edvel ou sutil. Em ambos os casos, sem considerar os efeitos de distor\u00e7\u00e3o a \n\ninterpreta\u00e7\u00e3o pode levar a conclus\u00f5es enganosas sobre as propriedades f\u00edsicas das estruturas \n\npesquisadas. \n\nEste trabalho trata com diferentes aspectos do M\u00e9todo Magnetotel\u00farico. Em primeiro lugar a \n\ndispers\u00e3o da resistividade \u00e9 estudada teoricamente realizando, pela primeira vez, simula\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nde um modelo 3-D da Terra (caso 1-D \u00e9 apresentado a partir de um trabalho anterior de \n\nEsposito e Patella, 2009 e o caso 2-D \u00e9 reconstru\u00eddo baseando a simula\u00e7\u00e3o sobre um trabalho \n\nde Mauriello et al., 1996), com um estudo de caso em uma \u00e1rea geot\u00e9rmica (Snake River \n\nPlain, Idaho, USA). \n\nMostra-se uma aplica\u00e7\u00e3o do MT na \u00e1rea do Pec\u00e9m (Cear\u00e1, Brasil), desconsiderando a \n\ndispers\u00e3o da resistividade, a fim de mostrar a efici\u00eancia do m\u00e9todo para resolver contrastes de \n\nresitividade na subsuperf\u00edcie e, finalmente, s\u00e3o realizadas as simula\u00e7\u00f5es te\u00f3ricas que mostram \n\na aplica\u00e7\u00e3o do m\u00e9todo MT para pesquisa de Ol\u00e9o e G\u00e1s na por\u00e7\u00e3o emersa da Bacia Potiguar \n\n(Rio Grande do Norte, Brasil), a fim de considerar a MT como um apoio em \u00e1reas onde a \n\ns\u00edsmica, usada principalmente para esses fins, pode ser logisticamente dif\u00edcil de aplicar ou \n\nprecisa de uma compara\u00e7\u00e3o com outros m\u00e9todos de prospec\u00e7\u00e3o geof\u00edsica. \n\n \n\nPalavras chaves: Dispers\u00e3o da resistividade.

The main goal of prospection is to detect the \n\ngeometry of the buried structures and objects and in particular to reveal areas of economic \n\ninterest, like mineral deposits, oil and gas reservoirs, underground water or geothermal fluids.  \n\nThere are different geophysical prospection methods and, because of the different field \n\nsources, each one is sensible to a particular physical property like the density in the \n\ngravimetric and seismic methods (in the latter case through the seismic waves velocity), \n\nelectrical resistivity (or its inverse, the conductivity) in the electric and electromagnetic \n\nmethods and the magnetic susceptibility in the magnetic method. \n\nThe field sources allow the classification of the methods in two categories: those that \n\nuse the natural field of the Earth (gravimetric, magnetic, electric and electromagnetic \n\nmethods) and the ones that need an artificial source (seismic, inductive electric and \n\nelectromagnetic methods). The natural or artificial fields that propagate in the subsurface are \n\nmeasured at the surface and the local field perturbations are supposed to be caused by the \n\npresence of structures buried at different depths.  \n\nAll prospecting methods are subjected to interpretation ambiguities due to the fact \n\nthat different geological configurations can reproduce the same effects at the surface. The \n\nsituation can be quite complex if the buried structures are bi-dimensional or anisotropic like \n\nseveral rocks, which store oil, gas and underground water (Jones, A., J., 2006)  \n\nIn the Magnetotelluric Method (MT) a source of ambiguity called resistivity \n\ndispersion exists. The resistivity dispersion phenomenon due to the induced polarization is a \n\nwell-known phenomenology (Martinez, J. and Armenta, J., 2007; Prosvirnin, S. L. and S. \n\nZouhdi, S., 2006; Sj\u00f6berg, D., 2006) and it can influence MT responses creating distortions in \n\nthe curves that may easily lead to an erroneous interpretation (Esposito, R. and Patella, D., \n\n2009, Patella, D., 1979). \n\nHydrocarbon and geothermal research are application fields, where MT is an ideal \n\napproach to detect dispersion-affected zones. These zones are fractured portions of rock, \n\nwhich have undergone diffuse alterations due to chemical interaction with uprising light \n\nhydrocarbons and hot fluids. They are considered reliable markers of the presence of \n\nexploitable reservoirs underneath (Sternberg and Oehler, 1990; Wright at al., 1985).  \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n19!\n\n \n\n \n\nThe thesis is divided in three chapters. The first one provides the theoretical bases of \n\nthe resistivity dispersion in the magnetotelluric method. In particular there are reported the \n\nMT responses over a 1-D and a 2-D polarizable structures. In the second chapter we \n\nperformed, thought the use of a modeling software, a set of 3-D theoretical simulations \n\nshowing the effects of the dispersion on the MT response curves resulting form a 3-D \n\nstructure underneath.  \n\nFinally in the third chapter we show the results of two MT applications, one field experiment \n\nand one theoretical study, in two different areas of the Northeast Brazilian coast. \n\n \n\n1.1 Objectives   \n!\n1.1.1 General \n!\nThe main objective of this work is to show the application of the Magnetotelluric method in \n\ndifferent areas and the analysis of resistivity dispersion over 3-D polarizable structures.  \n\n \n\n1.1.2 Specific \n!\nSpecific objectives are: \n\n \n\na) To perform numerical simulations of the MT response in presence of 3-D polarizable     \n\nstructures. \n\nb) To perform a case study of the geothermal area of Snake River Plain, Idaho. \n\nc) To process, invert and interpret data in the Cear\u00e1 costal area of Pec\u00e9m. \n\nd) To perform numerical simulations of the MT response in the emerged portion of the \n\nPotiguar Basin for Oil and Gas exploration. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.2 Justification \n!\n\nThe magnetotelluric method is increasingly used both in applied geophysics and in \n\nbasic research. It is less well known than seismology as Earth investigation technique, \n\nnevertheless the MT has a great potential that is yet to be fully realized. During the past \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n20!\n\ndecades the MT method passed through a phase of fast development especially from a \n\ncomputational point of view (with two and three-dimensional modeling and inversion), \n\nallowing a considerable improvement in the study of the Earth through this methodology. MT \n\ncan be an important interpretation tool, integrated with other geophysical prospection \n\nmethods, to the study of sedimentary basins for example, both terrestrial and oceanic. In the \n\ncase of active volcanic areas, the MT method is very efficient because it is able to reach great \n\ndepths in comparison to other electromagnetic methods and to distinguish deep geothermal \n\nreservoirs. MT method allows the location of the low resistivity anomalies under volcanic \n\nsediments.  \n\nAs we have mentioned before, a limit to the MT method can be the resistivity \n\ndispersion phenomenon, i. e. the resistivity is dependent from the incident wave frequency.   \n\nElectrical resistivity is the behavior of a material to oppose to the passage of electric current. \n\nIt is a parameter that can differentiate rocks (Palacky, G.V., 1987) and that depends on their \n\nphysical state, the presence of fluids in rock pores, soil permeability and its temperature \n\n(Keller and Frischknecht, 1966; Olhoeft, G. R., 1980). \n\nResistivity values vary in a very large interval, 10-7 - 107 ?m, differentiating rocks and \n\ntheir physical states. For example, the resistivities of saturated rocks are directly proportional \n\nto that of the fluid in the pores and inversely proportional to the porosity. Of course the \n\nelectrical resistivity alone is not enough for a precise identification of the materials or rocks \n\nbut to minimize the ambiguity on the resistivity values is undoubtedly an important and valid \n\ngoal. \n\nThe motivation behind this work is primarily the study (in addition to the one-\n\ndimensional and two-dimensional cases already studied) of the dispersion of the resistivity \n\ndue to 3-D polarizable structures in the subsurface and secondly the application, disregarding \n\nthe dispersion effect, of the method (both theoretically and experimentally) in areas not yet \n\nobserved by the MT. The importance of the 3-D Earth model affected by the resistivity \n\ndispersion is supported by a case study in which we observe clearly how the dispersive 3-D \n\nmodel fits very well the experimental data. This can be a starting point for the use of 3-D \n\nmodels including the resistivity dispersion where it is supposed to verify.  \n\nWe have chosen three types of geological structures in this work: the Snake River Plain, \n\n(Idaho, USA), the Pec\u00e9m region (Fortaleza, Cear\u00e1 State) and the Potiguar Basin (Rio Grande \n\ndo Norte). \n\nThere are different reasons behind the choice of these areas. The first is a geothermal \n\narea in which we have performed a 3-D theoretical simulation including the dispersion of the \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n21!\n\nresistivity to better fit the experimental data of Stanley (1982), the second is aimed at the \n\nknowledge and study of geological structure of a very poor known zone and the third is \n\nmotivated by the application of the MT method in areas, such as a sedimentary basin with \n\nhydrocarbon reservoirs, usually investigated by the seismic method, in order to show that the \n\nMT method can be a valuable support, less expensive than seismic and logistically easier to \n\napply . \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n!\n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n22!\n\n \n\n2 DISPERSIVE MAGNETOTELLURICS \n!\n2.1 Theoretical background of the Magnetotelluric Method (MT) \n!\n\nThe MT method is an exploration technique that uses the natural electromagnetic field \n\nto estimate electrical resistivity values of the subsurface. \n\nMT theory was introduced for the first time in 1950 by Tikhonov and in a more detailed way \n\nby Cagniard few years later, in 1953. It is based on the concept that electromagnetic waves \n\ngenerated in the far distance from the Earth's surface reach the crust of our planet where they \n\nvertically penetrate underground and provide information on the electrical properties of found \n\nmaterials. \n\nWhen the waves travelling underground encounter materials with different \n\nresistivities, they are partially reflected at the interfaces and they return to the surface \n\ncontaining information about the crossed layers. Natural electromagnetic fields used by the \n\nMT method are generated mainly by two phenomena and cover a frequency range between \n\n10-4 - 104 Hz. The first phenomenon is the interaction between the solar plasma and Earth's \n\nmagnetosphere (MT low frequency field, Fig. 5), and the second is the presence of storms \n\nbetween the two tropics (MT high frequency field, Fig. 6). (Parker, 1958; Campbell, 1987). \n\nInteractions between the solar wind and the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere generate \n\nfluctuations in the electromagnetic field lower than 1Hz. The solar wind emits streams of \n\nions, protons and electrons from the Sun, and on the encounter with terrestrial magnetic field \n\n(at the magnetopause) these protons and electrons, deflected in opposite directions, create an \n\nelectric field. This is a throbbing phenomenon, not static, which means that the deformation \n\nof the magnetic field is variable in time, with frequency between 1 Hz and 10-4 Hz. The \n\nincrease is solar wind pressure pushes the magnetopause closer to the Earth giving rise to \n\nmagnetic storms (Fig. 1) (Chapman and Ferraro, 1931). \n\nElectromagnetic fields with frequency higher than 1Hz have their origins in \n\nmeteorological activity like lightening discharges. These, known as \u201csferics\u201d (impulsive \n\nsignals emitted by lightening), propagate around the world within the waveguide bounded by \n\nthe ionosphere and Earth\u2019s surface (Dobbs, 1985, Electromagnetic Waves). \n\nIt is a source of uniform electromagnetic energy due to the constant presence of \n\nlightening on the Earth's surface. Zones where we have most of this type of activity are \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n23!\n\nlocated in the equatorial regions, where storms have an average rate of 100 days per year (Fig. \n\n2).  \n\nIt is a perturbation that propagates over a long distance, and as in the previous case, is not \n\nstatic, but produces a variable magnetic field this time with frequency between 1 Hz and 104 \n\nHz. \n\n \nFigure 1: Interaction between solar plasma and magnetosphere (a) Distortion of the front of solar plasma by Earth\u2019s \nmagnetic field.

Briefly, the solar wind is a continual stream of plasma,\n\nradiating mainly protons and electrons from the Sun. On encoun-\n\ntering the terrestrial magnetic field (at the magnetopause), these\n\nprotons and electrons are deflected in opposite directions, thereby\n\nestablishing an electric field (Figure 1.2).

Wait (1954) \n\nand Price (1962) showed that limitations of the normally incident wave assumption arise \n\nwhen the lateral extension of the source is not significantly larger than the penetration depth \n\nof electromagnetic fields into the Earth, requiring a correction in Cagniard\u2019s (1953) \n\nformulation. \n\nAnother peculiarity of the Tikhonov-Cagniard model is that it ignores the sphericity of \n\nthe earth. This question has been addressed by many researchers (Srivastava, 1966; \n\nSochel\u2019nikov, 1979; Kaufman and Keller, 1981; Berdichevsky and Zdanov, 1984) and the \n\nmost elegant solution has been advanced by P. Weidelt (1972) establishing the relationship \n\nbetween spherical and plane models. The conditions are satisfied for depths that not exceed a \n\nfew hundreds of kilometers.  Therefore, for the purpose of MT, it is sufficient to consider a \n\nflat Earth model with electromagnetic fields described in Cartesian coordinates. \n\nThe plane wave field is a mixture of monochromatic waves that travel vertically in the ground \n\nand generate telluric currents (from which the name magnetotelluric).  \n\n 13 \n\n \n\nFigura 2.3: Numero medio di temporali per anno sulla superficie terrestre. \n\n \n\nFigura 2.4: Spettro della densit\u00e0 di energia del campo elettromagnetico generato da un fulmine, in \nfunzione della distanza. \n\n2.1.2 Sorgenti a bassa frequenza  \n\nUno dei vantaggi della MT \u00e8 la possibilit\u00e0 di esplorare grandi profondit\u00e0: le frequenze pi\u00f9 \n\ninteressanti sono, quindi, quelle che variano nell\u2019intervallo 1-10-4Hz. \n\nIn questo range di frequenze le variazioni del campo elettromagnetico terrestre di origine \n\nesterna, sono legate all\u2019interazione del vento solare con il campo magnetico terrestre \n\npermanente e con la ionosfera. \n\nNelle vicinanze della terra, ad una distanza pari a 3-4 volte il raggio terrestre, le linee di forza \n\ndel campo magnetico terrestre sono abbastanza simmetriche, mentre a distanze maggiori, il \n\ncampo comincia a deformarsi: le linee di forza si infittiscono nella parte rivolta al sole, mentre \n\nsi diradano nella parte opposta. Questo accade a causa dell\u2019interazione tra il campo magnetico \n\ne il vento solare, ossia il flusso di particelle cariche che viene espulso senza interruzione dal \n\nsole a velocit\u00e0 comprese tra 300 e 800 km/s. Queste particelle, principalmente protoni ed \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n25!\n\nThe external energy reaches the Earth\u2019s surface where is partially reflected and the \n\nremaining part penetrates into the Earth inducing electric currents, known as telluric currents, \n\nwhich generate a secondary magnetic field.  \n\nMagnetotelluric is based on the simultaneous measurements of total electromagnetic \n\nfield, time variation of both magnetic field B(t) and induced electric field E(t), through which \n\nit is possible to obtain information on the electrical properties (electrical resistivity) since they \n\ncorrelated to the impedance Z, which is the ratio of the electrical (E) and magnetic (B) \n\ncomponents. \n\nAccording to the property of electromagnetic waves in the conductors, the penetration of \n\nelectromagnetic wave depends on the oscillation frequency through the following \n\nmathematical relationship: \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                          p ? 500 ?(?/f)                                 (1.1) \n \n\n \nwhere p, called skin depth is expressed in meters, ? is the resistivity expressed in ?m and f is \n\nthe frequency in Hz.  \n\nFrequency values between 10-4 Hz and 1 Hz (Magnetotellurics) investigate deeper \n\nstructures, and values between 1 Hz and 104 Hz (Audio-Magnetotellurics) \u201cshallower\u201d \n\nstructures instead. Skin depth depends also on resistivity values of the layers lying over the \n\ntarget. \n\nThe frequency interval between 0.5 and 5 Hz is known as dead band because in this \n\nrange of frequency the natural electromagnetic signal is not good enough to allow a good \n\nquality data acquisition and a good resolution of objects buried up to a few kilometers of \n\ndepth. \n\nGoldstein and Strangway in 1975 introduced a new methodology of artificial source \n\n(CSAMT - controlled source audio-magnetotellurics) to better study underground shallow \n\nlayers (up to 2-3 km). This is a high-resolution technique and it was found very efficient in \n\nimaging Earth\u2019s crust between 20m and 2000m. \n\nThe source of CSAMT method, typically in a frequency interval of 0.1 \u2013 8 kHz, \n\nconsists of en electric dipole positioned into the ground that generates an electromagnetic \n\nfield simulating the natural field. The electric dipole simulating the source, usually 2-3 km \n\nlong is positioned at a great distance (minimum 3 times the skin depth) from the \n\nmeasurements area.  The distance between the source and the measurements area is necessary \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n26!\n\nto guarantee that the field is not influenced by near-field effects. In the proximity of the \n\nsource the electromagnetic waves are curved and the Cagniard resistivity doesn\u2019t provide \n\nrealistic resistivity values. When far-field conditions are satisfied electric and magnetic fields \n\nbehave like plane waves, similar to natural MT and AMT, and for this reason we can use the \n\nsame equations used in the MT method. \n\n Data acquired allow us to calculate values of impedance Z, which is related to \n\nmagnetic field and electric field for every frequency value. \n\n \n\n                                                   \n!!\n!!  = \n\n!!! !!\"\n!!\" !!!  \n\n!!\n!! ,                                           (1.2) \n\n \n\n                   !! = !!!!! + !!\"!!,                                                (1.3) \n \n\n                                                    !! = !!\"!! + !!!!!.

In the frequency range of the MT method (10-4-104 Hz) a very important \n\nphenomenon can occur which gives additional information in underground investigation: the \n\nInduced Polarization phenomenon (10-2-102 Hz). \n\nInduced Polarization (IP) is the basis for a geophysical prospecting method as well \n\nand it occurs, under particular conditions, when electrical current flows into the subsoil. \n\nIt is a transient and very complex phenomenon, correlated to electrochemical processes in \n\nrocks and consists of the creation of electrical dipoles oriented with the electrical source field. \n\nMain factors that determine IP are: \n\n \n\n\u2022 Mineral composition \n\n\u2022 Rocks pattern \n\n\u2022 Water percentage \n\n\u2022 Chemical composition of water  \n\n \n\nExperimentally, Induced Polarization can be recognized by positioning on Earth\u2019s \n\nsurface a quadrupole ABMN, where A and B are the current electrodes while M and N are the \n\nvoltage electrodes. A direct current is sent into the subsoil and in presence of polarization the \n\npotential difference measured after the interruption of the current returns to zero slower than a \n\nnormal trend (Fig. 4).!!\nThe charges take some time to redistribute when an external DC electric field is \n\napplied (charging). Equivalently they take the same time to revert to a balanced distribuition \n\nonce the electric field is removed (discharging).  \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n30!\n\nThe subsoil behaves as a distribution of capacitors that are charged and uncharged. \n\nThe system will return to the state of equilibrium in an amount of time, which is function of \n\nthe soil polarizability.  \n \n\nFigure 4: Induced Polarization phenomenon (from Patella 2003): (a) measurements equipment over the surface, A \nand B are the current electrodes, M and N potential electrodes, (b) curves in time domain, (c) curves in frequency \ndomain. \n\n!\nFrom Patella, 2003. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe types of polarization are called: \n\n \n\n\u2022 Membrane polarization \n\n\u2022 Electrode polarization \n\n \n\nThere are two types of membrane polarization, the first one occurs when pore space \n\nnarrows to within several boundary layer thicknesses (which is the thickness of ions adsorbed \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n31!\n\nto a surface). Charges cannot flow easily, so they accumulate when an electric field is applied \n\nresulting in a net charge dipole, which adds to any other voltages measured at the surface. \n\nA second form of membrane polarization is similar to the first: this occurs when in the \n\nrock is present a discreet and widespread distribution of clay particles. Upon application of an \n\nelectric potential, positive charge carriers pass easily, while negative carriers accumulate. \n\nThere is an \u201cion-selective membrane.\u201d A surplus of both cations and anions occurs at one end \n\nof the membrane, while a deficiency occurs at the other end. \n\n \nFigure 5: (a) two types of membrane polarization, top and bottom figure respectively, (b) electrode polarization. \n\n \n\n!\n(a) (b) \n\nModified from a) Ward, 1990 b) Seigel, 1974 \n\n \n\nElectrode polarization occurs when pore space is blocked by metallic particles, as \n\noxides or sulphides. When an electric current is applied, which is in part electrolytic and \n\nelectronic, ions accumulate at the interface obstructing current flow (Snyder et al., 1977), the \n\nresult is two electrical double layers which add to voltages measured at the surface. \n\nWe can observe a transient potential both at the connection and at the shutdown of the \n\ncircuit, the two transient phases are equivalent, but usually the discharging transient is studied \n\nbecause is free from the \"light\" of the current. The phenomenon is studied in the frequency \n\ndomain applying Fourier transform of the transient in the time domain or sending alternating \n\ncurrent at different frequencies. \n\n8\n\nMembrane polarization\n\n9\n\nElectrode polarization\n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n32!\n\nTo study Induced Polarization is necessary to introduce physical models that can fully \n\nrepresent the phenomenon. One of the models used to study IP is called Debye model and it is \n\nexpressed in the following equation \n\n \n\n                                           \n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ! = !! !! exp ?\n!\n!!\n\n!\n\n!!!\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(2.1) \n\n \n\nin time domain (t), and \n\n!!!!!!! ! = !! 1 ?\n!\"!!\n\n1 + !\"!!\n\n!\n\n!!!\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(2.2) \n\n \n\nin the frequency domain (?), where ?n>0 is the amplitude of the n-th decay component, V0 is \n\nthe stationary value before the discharge, ?n is the decay constant of the n-th exponential, ?n= \n?n?n, ?0 is the resistivity in correspondence of V0. \n\nThe Debye model is based on the assumption that underground N different ionic \n\nspecies are present, in equation (2.1), we observe the superposition of exponential decays and \n\n(2.2), the overlap of the individual dispersion curves. \n\nThe definition of the Debye model thus involves the determination of 2n parameters \n\ntotally. Another physical model for the representation of the induced polarization \n\nphenomenon is the Cole-Cole model \n\n \n\n                                               \n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ! = !!!\n?1 !(!!)\n\n!\"\n\n?(1 + nc) !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(2.3)!\n!\n\n!!!\n \n\n                                               \n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ! = !! 1 ? !\n!\"# !\n\n1 + !\"# ! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(2.4) \n\n \n\nwhere m is a measure of material polarization,  0 ??c ? 1 is the frequency dependence factor, \n\n? the time constant in seconds, which determines the length of time required for the decay, \n\nand ?(1+nc) is the gamma function. \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n33!\n\nThe Cole-Cole model is an empirical model with just three parameters to be \n\ndetermined, m, ? and c, and it can be proven that it is a continuous distribution of individual \n\nDebye models. In the recent literature we find several studies concerning the reformulation of \n\nthe Debye and the Cole-Cole models (Weigand and Kemna, 2016; Gurin at al., 2015). \n\nNordsiek and Weller, for example, in 2008 proposed an alternative fitting approach for the \n\ninduced-polarization spectra using the decomposition of observed IP spectra into a variety of \n\nDebye spectra. It proves to be more flexible and stable, even for complicated phase spectra \n\nthat cannot be fitted by single Cole-Cole type models.  \n\nUstra et al. 2016 developed an alternative formulation for Debye decomposition \n\nthrough laboratory tests with sand and oil mixtures undergoing microbial degradation of \n\nhydrocarbons. They determined a relaxation time distribution (RTD) and two frequency-\n\nindependent parameters that modulate the complex conductivity spectra. The distribution of \n\nrelaxation times quantifies the contribution of each distinct relaxation process. Each \n\ncontribution can then be associated with specific polarization processes and the RTD reveals \n\nevidence of a length scale at which a new polarization process takes place as a result of the \n\nbiodegradation process. \n\nThe spatial and temporal behavior of an electric field generated into polarizable rocks \n\ndue to external sources is significantly different from the one expected if we consider valid \n\nOhm's law in its basic formulation. IP phenomenon is a clear sign that the electricity \n\nconduction in the rocks is very complex and cannot be synthesized by the classical \n\nrelationship: \n\n \n\n                                                                 ! = !!                                                                  (2.5) \n \n\nwhere the conductivity ? is assumed to be independent from time t in TD and from frequency \n\n? no FD. Polarization effects are observed when into the rocks there are alterations in the \n\ncrystal structure due to the circulation of hydrothermal fluids, hydrocarbon migration and \n\ntectonic metamorphism. \n\nAmong the various electromagnetic prospecting methods, which in principle can \n\nreport the occurrence of polarization phenomena, it is included the MT method. One of the \n\nways in which polarization manifests itself in the rocks consists in the resistivity variation by \n\nvarying the frequency of an alternating current flow passing there through (resistivity \n\ndispersion). For this reason one polarizable material opposes different resistivities at different \n\nmonochromatic components of MT field. \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n34!\n\nThe MT method requires an accurate analysis of the experimental data in the \n\nfrequency range between 10-4 and 104 Hz and this is precisely the range in which the \n\ndispersion phenomenon manifests if exists. It reveals itself with an anomalous behavior in the \n\nexperimental data that is not justified by the classical MT theory. \n\nAn example is shown in Figure 6, from Manzella et al. (2004), where we can observe \n\nan anomaly in MT curves. This anomaly cannot be justified as a response to any particular \n\ngeometry of the buried structure, but as a response to an abnormal physical behavior of the \n\nresistivity of the rocks. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6: Apparent resistivity and phase MT curves.

From \n\nequation (2.6) that describes the particles motion immersed in an external electric field, we \n\narrive to the following expression for the conductivity  \n\n \n\n            \n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ! =\n!\"#!!\n\n!! + !\"!! ? !!!!\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(2.16) \n\n \n\nand hence the resistivity \n\n \n\n                                            \n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ! =\n!! + !\"!! ? !!!!\n\n!\"#!! .!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(2.17) \n\n \n\nThe resistivity and the conductivity are called respectively impedivity and admittivity \n\nin the frequency domain (Patella 1987). \n\nFrom this expression that describes the overall behavior of a RLC series circuit we \n\nobtain the following dispersion models: \n\n \n\n1. the positive non-resonant model, in which real and imaginary part of the \n\nadmittivity are positive; \n\n2. the negative non-resonant model, in which real part of admittivity is positive \n\nand imaginary part is negative; \n\n3. the resonant model, in which both real and imaginary part of the admittivity \n\npresent a resonant peak; \n\n4.  the resonant positive model, in which the resonance is superimposed on the \n\npositive dispersion effect; \n\n5. the resonant positive model, in which the resonance is superimposed on the \n\npositive dispersion effect; \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n39!\n\n6. the resonant positive model, in which the resonance is superimposed on the \n\npositive dispersion effect; \n\n7. and the resonant negative model, in which the resonance is superimposed on \n\nthe negative dispersion effect. \n\n \n\nIn the case of non-resonant model one of the ion species consists of charges subject to \n\nfrictional force (R) and the other species is characterized by \"light\" charges subject to both \n\nfrictional forces and Coulomb force (RC). In other words one branch (R) represents the path \n\nwhich the unbound light ions run through, with instantaneous constant speed, under the action \n\nof the external exciting field. The other branch (RC) represents the path the bound light ions \n\ncan move through, under the action of the same external field and against the decelerating \n\nrecall forces. \n\nIn the non-resonant negative model one of the two species is formed by charges \n\nsubject to frictional force (R) as in the previous case, and the other has \"heavy\" charges \n\nsubject to the forces of inertia and friction (RL). In this case the second branch (RL) simulates \n\nthe accelerated path the unbound heavy ions can travel through, subject to the external field.  \n\nIn the resonant model one of the two species, as in the two previous cases, consists of \n\n\"light\" and \"bound\" charges (R) and the second one composed by \"heavy\" charges subject to \n\nall three kinds of forces: inertia, friction and Coulomb force (RCL). \n\nIn membrane polarization bound charges are represented by clay particles that with \n\ntheir negative charge distribution in the rock pores delay the flow of the positive ions \n\n(cations) in the solution because of Coulomb force. In electrode polarization instead the metal \n\nparticles obstructing the pores block the ions in the fluid solution. \n\n \n\n2.4.1 Non-resonant positive model \n \n\nIn the case of non-resonant positive model the conductivity is \n\n \n\n                                          \n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ! ! =\n!!!!!\n!!!\n\n+\n!\"!!!!!\n\n!!\" + !\"!!\"\n.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(2.18) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n40!\n\nusing \n\n \n\n       \n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! =\n!!!!!\n!!!\n\n,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(2.19) \n\n                                                      \n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! =\n!!!!!\n!!\"\n\n,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(2.20) \n\n                                                                                                               \n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! =\n!!\"\n!!\"\n\n,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(2.21) \n\n                                                          \n\n \n\nwe obtain \n\n \n\n                                          \n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ! ! =\n!!!! + !\"(!! + !!)\n\n!! + !\"\n.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(2.22) \n\n \n\n \n\nGeneralizing for a parallel combination of N microcircuits we obtain          \n\n \n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ! ! =\n!!!!!! + !\" !!! + !!!\n\n!!!! + !\"\n\n!\n\n!!!\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(2.23) \n\nfor a series combination instead we have \n\n \n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ! ! =\n!!! + !\"\n\n!!!!!!! + !\" !!! + !!!\n\n!\n\n!!!\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(2.24) \n\n \n\nwhere the symbol (+) is indicating we are considering the positive model. \n\nEquation (2.24) represents the positive non-resonant model of IP, real and imaginary \n\nparts are plotted in Figure 7. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n41!\n\nFigure 7: Positive non-resonant model diagram.

Instead, it is viewed as a geometrical effect due \n\nto the mutual arrangement between the measuring device and the polarized medium (Sumner \n\n1967; Bertin and Loeb, 1976; Nabighian and Elliot, 1976; Wait, 1982), or as an effect due to \n\ninductive coupling between the transmitter and the receiver circuit (Bertin and Loeb, 1976), \n\nor additionally as an effect due to current leakage of the transmitter circuit in proximity of the \n\nreceiver circuit (Cantwell and Madden, 1976). \n\nBut it is known that the negative dispersion is an intrinsic property of electrons in \n\nmetals at wavelengths smaller than 10-2 cm (Stratton, 1941), therefore to consider a negative \n\nIP model may actually provide information about the properties of the subsoil. \n\nLet's consider once again the system with two different ionic species, in this case the \n\ntwo species are mobile and just one of them has heavy ions. These ions have not negligible \n\ninertia, thus generating the equivalent RL effect. As mentioned before from a geological point \n\nof view the presence of heavy charges is connected to the presence of hydrocarbons or heavy \n\nmetal ions.  \n\nThen the conductivity expression in this case is \n\n \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n43!\n\n                                            \n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ! ! =\n!!!!!\n!!!\n\n+\n!!!!!\n\n!!\" + !\"!!!\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(2.30) \n\n \n\nusing (2.19), (2.20) and \n\n \n\n                                                            \n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! =\n!!!\n!!\"\n\n,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(2.31) \n\n \n\nwe obtain \n\n \n\n                                           \n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ! ! =\n!! + !! + !\"!!!!\n\n1 + !\"!!\n.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(2.32) \n\n \n\nThe equation (2.32) represents IP non-resonant negative model, real and imaginary \n\nparts are plotted in Figure 8.  \n\n \n\n!\nFigure 8: Negative non-resonant model diagram.

In fact, strong scattering \n\nphenomena can occur in a permeable rock, underlying a cover layer, because of the diffuse \n\npresence of mineral particles and clay particles formed by the aggressive action of fluids that \n\nare rising from an underlying reservoir. \n\nIf there is no certainty that data acquisition were made in a polarizable soil, the \n\ninterpretation of curves can be easily incorrect. \n\nTo demonstrate the equivalence problem that can occur we show an example of two \n\nMT response curves of two types of earth, one with two layers without dispersion of \n\nresistivity and the other with three layers, with the second layer being dispersive, specifically \n\naffected by a negative non-resonant type of dispersion. The solid curve is the response curve \n\nis the reference three-layer non-dispersive earth (Fig. 18).  \n\nFrom the Fig. 18 it is clear that the responses of the two layers earth without \n\ndispersion and the ones of the three layers earth with negative non-resonant dispersion appear \n\nidentical. For this reason MT measurements alone cannot distinguish in which of the two \n\ncases we are, making necessary the combination of MT with a direct-current prospecting \n\nmethod. An electric sounding is free from dispersion, as it operates in a nearly steady state \n\nregime, by constructing synthetic MT non-dispersive diagrams from a preliminary DES \n\n(Dipole Electric Survey) interpretation, it is possible to evidence dispersion effects from the \n\ncomparison between the true MT diagrams and the synthetic ones (Patella, 1987). \n\nIn the resonant case instead, both positive and negative, we can clearly notice the \n\npresence of a more or less marked resonance peak in MT curves characteristic, which can \n\nmake more recognizable the presence of dispersion. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n56!\n\nFigure 18: (a) The two Earth models considered for the simulations below: the two layers dispersion-free model \nand the three layers with second layer being dispersive (b) MT responses: the black lines are the reference \napparent impedivity modulus and phase curves for the dispersion-free H-type model drawn in Fig. 12 The red \nlines are the apparent impedivity modulus and phase responses for the same H-type sequence, with the second \nlayer affected by a non-resonant negative dispersion, with parameters m? = 0.1, c? = 1 and ?? = 100 s.

We \n\nstudied a simple case of a conductive body immersed in a more resistive environment that can \n\nbe appropriate to represent the characteristics of a magma chamber. The conductive body with \n\nresistivity of 10 ?m has dimensions of 2x2km (lateral and vertical extensions), it is located at \n\na depth of 1km in a host material of 200 ?m of resistivity and it is centered with respect to a 7 \n\nkm long profile with 15 MT stations which spaced 500m one from each other (Fig. 19). \n\nIn this simulation we performed a 2-D inversion with synthetic data originated from \n\nthe forward 2-D model responses considering the body affected by resistivity dispersion. The \n\nMT responses of the forward 2-D model and the 2-D inversion have been performed with the \n\nsoftware WinGLinK 2.01.01. \n\nSimulations are made considering the buried body both non-dispersive and dispersive \n\nto observe the difference in MT responses. \n\n \nFigure 19: 2D Earth model, the red body buried into the ground is considered dispersive.

(2.39) we calculated the resistivity value that \n\nthe body exhibits, at a defined frequency (for instance 10Hz), with the parameters      c = 0.75, \n\nm = 0.9 and ? = 100s (chosen according to the 1-D simulations), and we run again the forward \n\n2D model to obtain the correspondent MT curves. \n\n \n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ! = !! 1 ? !\n!\"# !\n\n1 + (!\"#)! .!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(2.39) \n\n \n\nWe have repeated this procedure for sixteen different values of frequency from a value of \n\n0.001 Hz until a few hundreds of Hertz. \n\nAs an example, in Fig. 20, we show the MT responses at three different stations of the \n\nprofile, the first one located in the proximity of the border of the body, the second one \n\ncentered with respect to the lateral extension of the conductive body and the third one \n\npositioned 2km far away from body border.   \n\nOnce we have replaced the resistivity of the body with the Cole-Cole resistivity we \n\nrun the forward 2-D model procedure for each of the sixteen values. From the apparent \n\nresistivities and phases resulting from the direct modeling procedure, we constructed the MT \n\ncurves having a resistivity has a function of the frequency. \n\nThe MT curves so constructed have been used as the input for the 2-D inversion; in \n\norder to understand which Earth model solution we reach. The results of the 2-D inversion are \n\nshown in Fig. 21 and Fig. 22, for the non-dispersive case and the dispersive case respectively, \n\nconsidering an error of 10% on the resistivity values and phases for both TE and TM mode. \n\nAs we can see clearly from the two figures the input MT curves lead to a two slightly \n\ndifferent Earth models, in the dispersive case the body appears bigger in the lateral dimension \n\nand more conductive. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n59!\n\nFigure 20: Apparent resistivity and phase curves for the 2-D Earth model of Fig. 19.

The forward modeling code computes magnetic and electric fields at \n\nthe surface of a 3-D electrical resistivity model crossed by electromagnetic plane waves, the \n\nfields computed are converted to magnetotelluric impedances and consequently to resistivity \n\nand phase curves at the stations contained in the mesh area. \n!\n\n3.1 3-D simulation of dispersive effects in MT \n\n \n!\n\nIn Fig. 23 we present the 3D model assumed for the simulations. A horizontal \n\ndispersive prism with resistivity ?0=10 ?m is buried in a non-dispersive half-space with \n\nresistivity of 200 ?m. The 3D body has horizontal length of 6 km along the y-axis and square \n\nedges of 2x2 km2. The top face is located at 2 km depth. \n\n \nFigure 23: The 3D model and the selected profiles with corresponding station sites on the left, on the right the model \nseen from above. \n\n \n\n!\n\n!\n!\n \n\nThe simulations have been done along three 8 km long profiles parallel to the x-axis. \n\nProfile 1 crosses the prism's mid-length, profile 2 is 2250 m apart from profile 1, and profile 3 \n\nis 1500m apart from profile 2 (Fig. 23). 17 MT station points, spaced 500 m from each other, \n\nhave been assumed along the profiles. The frequencies 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001 Hz have \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n62!\n\nbeen taken to plot modulus and phase of the MT apparent impedivity functions of the TE and \n\nTM modes, in order to show how IP alters the MT profiles at decreasing frequency, i.e. at \n\nincreasing penetration depth. \n\nAs in the 2-D Earth model simulations we used the positive Cole-Cole dispersion \n\nmodel reported in the Eq. (2.39) with the parameters c = 0.75, m = 0.9 and ? = 100s, and we \n\ncalculated the resistivity value that the body exhibits, at a defined frequency, specifically at \n\n10, 1, 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001 Hz. For each of the resistivity value assigned to the body we run the \n\nforward 3-D model to obtain the MT curves plotting modulus and phase of the MT apparent \n\nimpedivity functions of the TE and TM modes, in order to show how IP alters the MT profiles \n\nat decreasing frequency, i.e. at increasing penetration depth. \n\nFor the sake of conciseness, only one example of simulation is presented, which refers \n\nto the following Cole-Cole parameter set for the dispersive prism: m=0.9, ?=10 s and c=0.75 \n\n(Fig.24 through Fig.38).

The blue curves refer to the reference not dispersive response, while the red curves to the dispersive case. \n\n!\n!\n!\n\nAlong the profile 1, centered over the prism (Fig.28 to Fig.32), the departure of the red \n\nlines from the reference blue lines, for both modulus and phase of the TE and TM modes, is \n\nvery evident. The IP effect manifests with a more pronounced minimum of both the TE and \n\nTM apparent impedivity modulus, centered above the median axis of the 3D dispersive body. \n\nT The departure from the reference non-dispersive profiles starts to grow from 10 Hz, \n\nreaches its maximum at 1 Hz, then slowly decreases as frequency decreases, until it almost \n\ndisappears at 0.001 Hz. A specular character is observed in the phase curves, where the \n\ndispersion-related red lines show a magnified maximum with respect to the non-dispersive \n\nreference blue lines. For all frequencies the more vigorous effect is observed in the TE mode. \n\n!\n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\n2.2\n\n2.4\n\nstation position (m)\n\nR\nho\n\n (O\nhm\n\n m\n)\n\nTE\n\n \n\n \nnodisp\ndisp\n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\n2.2\n\n2.4\n\nstation position (m)\n\nR\nho\n\n (O\nhm\n\n m\n)\n\nTM\n\n \n\n \nnodisp\ndisp\n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000\n44.8\n\n44.9\n\n45\n\n45.1\n\n45.2\n\n45.3\n\n45.4\n\n45.5\n\n45.6\n\nstation position (m)\n\nP\nh \n\n(\u00b0\n)\n\nTE\n\n \n\n \nnodisp\ndisp\n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000\n44.8\n\n44.9\n\n45\n\n45.1\n\n45.2\n\n45.3\n\n45.4\n\n45.5\n\n45.6\n\nstation position (m)\nP\n\nh \n(\u00b0\n\n)\n\nTM\n\n \n\n \nnodisp\ndisp\n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n66!\n\nProfile 2 \n\nFigure 29: Modulus (top diagrams, in ?m) and phase (bottom diagrams, in deg.) of the two orthogonal TM and TE \nmodes of the MT apparent impedivity response against distance (in m) along the profile 2, calculated at the frequency \nof 10 Hz.

The first one is that the departure of \n\nthe dispersive red curves from the non-dispersive blue curves is less pronounced than in the \n\nprevious case. The second difference regards mainly the TE mode and does not depend on \n\ndispersion. It consists in a symmetrical slope reversal in the central portion of the anomaly, \n\nwith appearance of peaks in correspondence of the median longitudinal axis of the prism.

The different width of the anomaly centered above the prism \n\nbecomes, instead, the dominant character, especially for the curves of the modulus. The red \n\ncentral anomalies at 1 Hz are less wide than the corresponding blue anomalies, then, from 0.1 \n\nHz down to 0.001 Hz, the red anomalies gradually become wider than the blue ones. \n\nOf course, the amount of distortion of the MT response over a polarizable body \n\ndepends on the values assigned to the Cole-Cole parameters, m, ? and c. Values of m in the \n\nrange 0.4 to 0.9, of ? in the range 10?3 s to 104 s, and of c in the range 0.1 to 0.8 are reported in \n\nliterature from laboratory and field experiments made with full spectral or multifrequency IP \n\nmethods (e.g., Keller and Frischknecht, 1966; Sumner, 1976; Pelton et al., 1978). Mauriello et \n\nal. (1996) gave a detailed overview on this topic, and inferred from 2D simulations that high \n\nvalues of m (not less than 0.75) and ? (not less than 100 s) are ideal for dispersion effects to be \n\nrecognizable in MT measurements.  They also showed that the TE is always the most \n\ndistorted MT mode. Esposito and Patella (2009) showed that c has practically no remarkable \n\ndistortion effect in MT on 1D structures. The low influence of c was also inferred by \n\nMauriello et al. (1996) in 2D cases. The above effects have also been tested within the present \n\nstudy devoted to 3D structures.

A further \n\nconsideration is that visible distortion effects can be obtained even when the m and ? vary in \n\nopposite directions. The sense is that the choice of an exceedingly low value of one of them \n\nmust be compensated by a quite high value of the other one. This is just the case we have \n\ndiscussed a few lines above, where the value ?=10 s, well below the lower limit of the ?-range \n\npreviously recalled, is compensated by the value m=0.9, at the top limit of the m-range. \n\n3.1.1 Field example \n!\n\nWe now show a field example already studied by Mauriello and Patella (1999) in the \n\nframe of the probability tomography imaging. The area is the eastern Snake River Plain \n\n(SRP), Idaho, where a MT profile was performed by Stanley (1982), near the Idaho National \n\nEngineering and Environmental Laboratory (Fig. 39). Fig. 40 shows the TM and TE apparent \n\nresistivity pseudosections across the SRP MT profile obtained from a computerization of the \n\nfield data set of Stanley. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n73!\n\nFigure 39: The eastern Snake River Plain with indication of the MT stations along the profile measured by Stanley \n(1982) and of the INEL-1 test borehole. \n \n\n!\nFrom Stanley, 1982. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe SRP is an arcuate depression bounded on both sides by the Basin and Range \n\nstructures, and for much of its extent it is underlain by basalt and interbedded continental \n\nQuaternary and Tertiary sediments (Mabey, 1982). Mauriello and Patella (1999) applied the \n\n2D probability tomography imaging to the SRP TM and TE pseudosections in Fig.40 and \n\nevinced within the SRP depression a laterally bounded conductive slab with lateral extension \n\nof about 17 km and a mean depth to its top of about 2 km. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n74!\n\nFigure 40: The Snake River Plain MT TM and TE field pseudosections.

(1996), the 2D structure depicted in Fig. 41.a was then proposed. \nFigure 41.a: The NW-SE section of the interpreted Snake River Plain structural model across the MT profile by \nStanley (1982), The 3D conductive slab (15 km wide in the direction normal to the section) is assumed to be affected \nby resistivity frequency dispersion. \n\n!\n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n75!\n\nComparing the synthetic TM and TE pseudosections from the 2D model in Fig. 41.a \n\nwith the original ones in Fig.40, Mauriello and Patella (1999) found a good matching of the \n\ntwo TM pseudosections, while the TE ones were judged not properly conforming to each \n\nother. They attributed this discrepancy to the circumstance that the TE mode is much more \n\naffected than the TM mode whenever a 2D geometry is assumed to approximate a limited \n\nstrike length slab (Wannamaker et al., 1984,1997; Livelybrooks et al., 1996). \n\nBecause of the advanced nowadays 3-D forward modeling we decide to propose a 3-D \n\nrefinement (Fig 41.b) of the 2-D section in Fig. 41.a, using the same resistivity sequence and \n\nCole-Cole parameters and assigning after trial-and-error a final strike length of 15 km to the \n\nhorizontal slab (y direction), shorter than the width of the infinite length slab in the original 2-\n\nD model. \n\n \nFigure 41.b: The 3-D model of Snake River Plain.

In fact, m can be associated to the degree of alteration and mineral \n\nparticle deposition due to rock-fluid interaction. Within certain limits, the higher is the \n\nvolume percent of alteration products occluding rock fissures and pores, the higher is m. For \n\nthe examined SRP field case, high m values, up to 0.95, have been required to model the MT \n\nprofile, fully consistent with values found in other volcanic and geothermal environments \n\n(Patella et al., 1991; Coppola et al., 1993; Giammetti et al., 1996; Di Maio et al., 2000; \n\nMauriello et al., 2000, 2004).  \n\n The parameter ?, instead, seems governed by the local temperature, versus which it has \n\na rather complex direct proportionality, like in the empirical diagram shown in Fig.44, which \n\nwas derived from the analysis of other partially or totally controlled volcano-geothermal \n\nconditions (Mauriello et al., 2004). Therefore, the values of ? reported in Fig. 41.a should \n\nindicate temperatures between 70\u00b0C and 125\u00b0C in the central part of the slab and between \n\n50\u00b0C and 90\u00b0C in the side parts, in the depth range 1.5-2,5 km below the SRP depression. \n\nThese indirect temperature estimates are in full agreement with data from the INEL-1 test \n\nhole (Mann, 1986). \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n78!\n\n \n \nFigure 44: Temperature versus Cole-Cole time constant empirical diagram in different areas of the Earth. \n \n\n \n\n!\n\n!\nFrom Giammetti et al., 1996. \n\n!\n\n \n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n79!\n\n4 MT METHOD AND RESULTS \n!\n\nNow we disregard the dispersion of the resistivity to dedicate our attention to the \n\napplication, both practical and theoretical, of the magnetotelluric method in two different \n\ngeological environments, the Pec\u00e9m region (Cear\u00e1) and the Potiguar Basin (Rio Grande do \n\nNorte). The ideal approach to evaluate the possible dispersion of the resistivity in the Pec\u00e9m \n\nregion is to perform a geoelectrical measurement campaign in order to obtain calculated MT \n\ncurve that we can compare with the measured ones. In the case of Potiguar Basin we know \n\nthat we are dealing with the presence of hydrocarbon reservoir so we can suspect that the \n\ndispersion of the resistivity may affect the MT data. In this case we have decided to study the \n\nresistivity dispersion in a future work, when an MT field campaign will be performed in the \n\narea, preferably a CSAMT campaign (Controlled Source Audio-Magnetotellurics) so as to \n\nhave a better resolution in the first kilometer, and we can compare the measured data with the \n\nsynthetic dispersive ones.  \n\nFor now we have concentrated our attention to the use of the classical MT method in \n\nthese two environments. \n\n!\n\n4.1 Data acquisition \n!\n\nTo perform MT and CSAMT data acquisition we arrange over the surface electric and \n\nmagnetic sensors (Fig. 45). Magnetic sensors are positioned in the three orthogonal direction \n\nx, y, z (NS, WE, depth) are formed by a solenoid that rotate around a high magnetic \n\npermeability core material which easily retails magnetic field lines. The assembly is inserted \n\ninto a tube whose extremities are electrical contacts that detect potential differences due to the \n\npassage of current in the solenoid. The electrical sensors consist of a pair of electrodes placed \n\ninto the ground in order to measure the potential difference caused by the passage of electric \n\ncurrent.    \n\nUnlike magnetic sensors, electrical sensors are positioned only in the two directions x, \n\ny; the vertical component of the electric field is not measured, being zero the electric \n\ncomponent at the interface surface \u2013 air (Fig.46). \n\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n80!\n\n!\nFigure 45: MT equipment for data acquisition.

The user defines a set of \n\ntransmission frequencies and a set of transmission times; the transmission times are equal to the \n\nreceiving times.

In the MT method, these functions are the values of impedance \n\ntensor. \n\nThe purpose is to determine with greater precision possible, the surface impedance \n\ntensor that connects, for each frequency values ?, the horizontal electric field components \n\nEx and Ey at the Hx and Hy components of the magnetic field. Fig. 47 shows a limited \n\nportion of the time series registration of the electric and magnetic field. The signals acquired \n\ncan have extension of minutes or even days, months, depending on the frequency \n\ncomponent, and consequently the depth, we are interested in. \n \n\nFigure 47: MT time series. \n\n!\n!\n\nThe first step is to pass from time domain to frequency domain applying a Fourier \n\nTransform to several time windows. \n\nData!acquisition Processing Inversion Interpretation \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n82!\n\nImpedance tensor Z does not change very quickly with frequency. For this reason the \n\nsame Z can be associated to an entire frequency band. Generally in order to characterize the \n\ntendency of an impedance curve, from 6 to 10 frequency points are used per logarithmic \n\ndecade. \n\nTherefore a fixed number of frequencies are chosen and finally the impedance is \n\nestimated by least squares technique or robust techniques. Once impedance tensor is \n\nobtained apparent resistivity and phase values are calculated (Fig. 48). \n\n \nFigure 48: Apparent resistivity and phase curves.

In the case of magnetotelluric method, as in many other geophysical \n\nmethods, the purpose of inversion is to reconstruct the subsurface resistivity distribution \n\nfrom data measured at the surface. \n\nThe first step is the creation of a direct model, in other words, basing on preliminary \n\ninformation of the surface and the subsurface it is calculated the synthetic response of the \n\nEarth starting from an input model. \n\nThe second step is the comparison of synthetic response data with the measured data \n\non the surface, i.e. minimize the difference between measured and synthetic data refining the \n\nEarth model. \n\n \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n83!\n\n4.4 MT study in Pec\u00e9m region \u2013 Cear\u00e1 \n\n \n\nWe present a case study in an area in the Northeast of Brazil, precisely in the west \n\ncoast of the State of Cear\u00e1.

This area can be associated, \n\ngeologically, to the Shear Zone Paramonti described in literature (Amaral &amp; \n\nSantos, 2008). Such interpretation is supported by rock types present in the \n\nshear zone composed by aluminous metasediments and schists. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Two zones with resistivities R2 higher than 250 ?m enclosing the conductive \n\narea C1. This geoelectric zone is associated with the Central Cear\u00e1 Complex \n\nrepresented by Canind\u00e9 Unit composed by paragneiss, migmatites and \n\nmatabasic rocks. \n\n \n\n\u2022 The resistive zone R1 with value of resistivity up to 8000?m order is located \n\nin the eastern section. This geoelectric zone is most likely a major crustal block \n\nof highly resistive nature that can be associated to the granitic massif of the \n\nSerra do Ju\u00e1 with a significant geographic and spatial distribution. It is \n\nnoteworthy that the geological mapping by CPRM does not present this \n\nfeature. Parallel to Paramonti shear zone and at a depth of around 6000 meters \n\nanother resistive block can be distinguished, and associated with the Serra do \n\nJu\u00e1 mentioned earlier.  \n\n!\n \n\nWe tried to make a comparison with the geological data presented by Amaral &amp; \n\nSantos (2008) that consider supracrustal units as River Curu Unit (CCP2) which would \n\ncorrespond to Caninde Unit of CPRM (2003) and the internal rocks as the shear zone \n\nParamonti (Paramonti Sequence Amaral &amp; Santos, 2008 - CCP3; Independ\u00eancia Unit of \n\nCPRM, 2003). The latter composed by aluminium metassediments, mylonite and granulites \n\nrocks possibly presents the conductive characteristic denoted from the result of the inversion. \n\nThe unit with biotite gneisses locally migmatized and with granodiorites (Ccp4) of \n\nAmaral &amp; Santos (2008) presents the same resistivity contrasts. \n\nFinally, it is shown in Figure 52 a new geological context obtained from the MT \n\nprofile and from the interpretations raised from data inversion and considering a number of \n\nnew geological field observations.  \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n88!\n\nThe resistive zone, that in the calculated model (Fig. 50) we called R1, is easily \n\nassociated with the granitic massif emerging in the CPRM map near the station MT1. The \n\ngranite rock is characterized by high resistivity values; therefore we can consider the structure \n\nunderneath as a continuation of itself. The conductive area is correlated to the Paramonti \n\nsubduction zone, which exhibits low resistivity values due to the presence of fluids typical of \n\nthe fault zones. \n\n \nFigure 52: Geological context realized with MT data of this study and other geological field observations. \n\n \n\n!\n!\n\n \n!\n \n\n \n!\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nMT stations \n\nCities \n\nDirections \n\nCear\u00e1 Complex \u2013 Independ\u00eancia Unit   \n\nCear\u00e1 Complex \u2013 Canind\u00e9 Unit   \n\nRecent coverage / Barreiras Group \n\nPhonolites \n\nGranitic massif \n\nCear\u00e1 Complex \u2013 Granitic Unit   \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n89!\n\n4.5 Potiguar Basin \n\n \n\nPotiguar Basin (Bacia) has an extension of approximately 119.300 km2 and is \n\nlocalized between the states of Rio Grande do Norte and Cear\u00e1, in the northeast of Brazil. The \n\nemerged portion has an extension of 33.200 km2 and the remaining part of 86.100 km2 is the \n\nsubmerged portion. Figure 53 shows the structural geology of the Potiguar Basin. \n\n \nFigure 53: The Structural Geology of Potiguar Basin. Brown is the crystalline basement; blue squares represent the \nareas of petroleum field; is possible to see several graben and horts, platforms and faults. Red lines represents the \nfaults in the area. \n\n \n\n!\nfrom Angelin et al., 2006, Hoerlle et al., 2007. \n\n!\nThe Potiguar Basin is inserted in the northern portion of the Borborema Province, it \n\nbelongs to the Precambrian geological segment, formed during Pan-African/Brasiliano \n\n(Neoproterozoic) Orogeny and is characterized by a complex arrangement of tectono-\n\nstratigraphic domains, bounded by zones regional shear and intense granitic magmatism \n\n(Almeida et al, 1977; Fetter et al., 2003). \n\nThe Potiguar Basin is related to a series of intra-continental basins that compose the \n\nRift System in Northeast Brazil (Matos, 1987). There are several models in literature that \n\nattempt to explain the process of formation of the Potiguar basin. \n\nFor example Fran\u00e7olin &amp; Szatmari (1987) suggest that the origin of the Potiguar Basin \n\nis related to the evolution of the Atlantic Equatorial Margin started at the end of the Jurassic.  \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n90!\n\nThe clockwise rotation between Africa and South America generated stresses in the \n\nBorborema Province with a resultant East-West compression and Northeast relaxation.  \n\nIn Figure 54 we can see the stratigraphy of Potiguar Basin with the principal \n\npetroliferous systems (Pessoa Neto et al., 2007). \n\n \nFigure 54: Cretaceous Geology of Potiguar Basin and the principal petroliferous systems. \n\n \n\n \nfrom Pessoa Neto et al., 2007. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.5.1 Modelling and simulations in Potiguar Basin  \n!\n \n\nWe present theoretical MT simulations in order to calculate the MT response in \n\npresence of hydrocarbon reservoirs. The synthetic responses are performed over a 3-D model \n\nof the Potiguar Basin, which structure has been obtained from the studies of Bertani et al.,!\n1990.  \n\nSimulations, as in the previous cases, are performed using the software WINGLING \n\n2.01.01.

This makes the interpretation of the results quite \n\nsimple and clear. \n\nAlso for the reservoir H3 two values of the resistivity have been considered, 750?m and \n\n5000?m, but the results are not so encouraging. Looking at the Figs. 64, 65 and 66 we observe \n\nthat reservoir H3, deeper than H2, is barely visible in the pseudosections (Fig. 65 and 66) and this \n\nis confirmed by the misfit, in Fig. 67, which values fall within the margin of error of 5%.  \n\nFrom the simulations we can assume that this is as a case limit for MT detection of \n\nreservoir in area of Serra do Mel. Through these simulations we have seen that the deeper \n\nreservoir is a threshold for this geological environment, beyond which the MT method does not \n\nprovide useful information. This is a quite surprising result considering that both the resistivity \n\nvalue of the reservoir (5000?m) and its thickness in proportion to the depth are features that \n\nshould highlight the presence of the reservoir. The result obtained should be verified with an MT \n\nsounding in the area to confirm that it is necessary the use of another geophysical prospecting \n\nmethod. \n\n!\nFigure 64: Resistivity TE and TM pseudosections without reservoirs.

As \n\nwe have seen the detection of hydrocarbon reservoirs, as well as different types of buried \n\nstructures depends on various factors; resistivity contrast, size of the reservoirs and their \n\ndepths.  \n\nThe same structure can be studied considering the dispersion of the resistivity; this is \n\nan environment in which we can expect the occurrence of the phenomenon and it could be \n\nvery interesting to observe and analyze its effect on the responses.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n!\n\nResistivity Misfit  \nTM misfit TE misfit \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n100!\n\n!\n\n5 CONCLUSIONS \n!\nThe use of the MT method, to reconstruct images of the subsurface using electrical \n\nresistivity contrasts, is constantly in evolution and it is more and more accurate both \n\ntheoretically and experimentally. Nevertheless this methodology is not widely applied and \n\nfrequently its great potential is neglected. \n\nAlthough the resistivity dispersion in MT is a well-known phenomenon it is often \n\noverlooked or ignored in the analysis of MT data. \n\nFor these reasons in this work we have treated both the dispersion of the resistivity in \n\nMT, and the classical MT method in the Pec\u00e9m region, never applied before, and in the \n\nPotiguar Basin where generally the seismic method is used. \n\nStarting from the MT responses in the cases of 1-D and 2-D polarizable structures we \n\nhave seen, primarily, how a very simple 2-D dispersive structure has an effect on the \n\nresponses curves to the point that the inversion procedure lead to a solution that differs from \n\nthe case without dispersion. We next, using a 3-D modeling software, performed and showed \n\nthe effects on the MT responses of a 3-D polarizable structure and how, applying it to a real \n\ncase, the resistive tridimensional model has a good fit with the experimental data. The type of \n\nthe 3-D structure modeled in this work can be very useful to model geothermal and \n\nhydrocarbon reservoirs, which likely account for the presence of relevant dispersion effects, \n\ndue to the high degree of alteration produced by the circulation of aggressive fluids. The \n\ndispersion effects have been evaluated along three parallel profiles, normal to the longitudinal \n\naxis of the 3-D prism. Amplitude variations of the anomaly above the dispersive body have \n\nbeen recognized, depending on the position of the profile from the center to the edges of the \n\nprism. \n\nThe 3-D MT curves affected by the dispersion as well as the consideration of the \n\neffect in the Snake River Plain field case show that the inclusion, in the forward 3-D \n\nmodeling, of the resistivity dispersion is a good contribution to a better comprehension of the \n\nstructures in the subsurface. These results invite the MT users to deal with care the areas that \n\nmay manifest the dispersion of the resistivity so as to minimize, as much as possible, the \n\ninterpretation ambiguities. \n\nFrom the application of the classical MT method we have seen that it is very effective \n\nfor increasing the geological, tectonic and structural knowledge of the complex environment  \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n101!\n\n \n\nof the Pec\u00e9m region. We have observed its efficiency in resolving very strong resistivity \n\ncontrasts between crustal blocks.  \n\nIt is recommended to increase the spatial resolution of MT acquisitions in order to \n\nbetter discriminate the targets detected here. A geophysical acquisition with the transient \n\nelectromagnetic method (TDEM) or with the controlled source audio-magnetotellurics \n\n(CSAMT) at the same location of the MT stations should be made in order to improve the \n\nresolution of the data in shallower depths, and to aid in filtering. \n\nThe second application of MT, on the structural model of the Potiguar Basin, showed \n\nthrough theoretical simulations that within certain limits the presence of hydrocarbon \n\nreservoir is detected by MT measurements.  \n\nFrom the pseudosections we have seen that shallow reservoirs are well revealed and \n\nlocalized, both if we consider the resistivity value one order of magnitude bigger than the \n\nsurrounding and if the reservoirs are supposed to have a very high resistivity value. \n\nThe case with the deeper reservoir instead does not provide so satisfying results; the \n\npseudosections barely show the presence of hydrocarbon, then we can assume this as a case \n\nlimit for the Potiguar Basin geological structure. It could be useful, for this reason, to perform \n\nin the future an MT data acquisition in the Basin to observe the experimental MT responses in \n\nthis region. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n!\n\n!\n\n102!\n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n!\nAlmeida, F.F.M., Hasui, Y., Brito Neves, B.B. &amp; Fuck, R.A., 1977.
