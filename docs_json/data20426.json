Four hundred and eighty ROSS 308 male broilers were raised in battery cages measuring 0.72 m2,\nfrom 1 to 21 days of age. Feed was offered ad libitum, and environmental temperatures were kept in thermoneutral\nconditions. Water intake was estimated based on a control group, two days older than the experimental birds, with same\ninitial weight. A linear reduction on bird performance, duodenal villi height, and fresh organs weight were observed as WR\nincreased. At 21 days of age, for each 1% WR, a weight loss of 8.5 g was observed. However, the mortality rate was not\naffected by any WR level. Organ weight, relative to body weight, was not affected by WR, except for heart, which weight\nincreased with WR. Villi numbers and crypts depth were not affected by WR. Birds under WR changed their behavior,\nbecoming aggressive and irritated. Electron microscopy data showed higher villi extrusion in WR broilers. In conclusion,\nWR, regardless its magnitude, should be avoided in broiler production.\n\nKey Words: behavior, chickens, duodenal morphology and histology, organs, water\n\nInflu\u00eancia da restri\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua no desempenho e no desenvolvimento dos\n\u00f3rg\u00e3os de frangos de corte\n\nRESUMO - Avaliou-se a influ\u00eancia da restri\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua (0, 10, 20, 30 e 40%) no desempenho, no comportamento e\ndesenvolvimento de org\u00e3os (cora\u00e7\u00e3o, perna, proventr\u00edculo e moela, f\u00edgado e intestinos) e na micrometria intestinal de frangos\nde corte. Utilizaram-se 480 machos, linhagem ROSS 308, do 1o ao 21o dia de idade, criados em gaiolas de 0,72 m2. As aves\nreceberam dieta basal \u00e0 vontade e foram mantidas em temperatura de conforto t\u00e9rmico. O consumo de \u00e1gua foi estimado em\num grupo de aves controle, dois dias mais velhas que as aves experimentais, por\u00e9m com o mesmo peso inicial. As medidas de\ndesempenho foram tomadas semanalmente e o consumo de \u00e1gua, diariamente. Aos 21 dias, 18 aves por n\u00edvel de restri\u00e7\u00e3o\n(tratamento) foram sacrificadas para realiza\u00e7\u00e3o das medidas de micrometria intestinal (6 aves) e do peso de \u00f3rg\u00e3os (12 aves).\nDiariamente, observou-se o comportamento das aves durante o per\u00edodo de fornecimento da \u00e1gua. O desempenho das aves, a\naltura das vilosidades duodenais e os pesos frescos dos \u00f3rg\u00e3os reduziram de forma linear de acordo com o aumento da restri\u00e7\u00e3o\nde \u00e1gua. Aos 21 dias de idade, a cada 1% de restri\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua, houve perda de 8,5 g no ganho de peso. No entanto, a mortalidade\nn\u00e3o foi afetada por qualquer n\u00edvel de restri\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua. N\u00e3o foi encontrada diferen\u00e7a na profundidade de cripta, no n\u00famero\nde vilos e no peso relativo dos org\u00e3os (em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao peso corporal), exceto do cora\u00e7\u00e3o, que aumentou com a restri\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua.\nNas aves sob restri\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua, houve maior extrus\u00e3o dos vilos.

While growth rate, uniformity and health are\ncommon problems in commercial production, water quality\n\nand consumption are usually not taken into consideration\n(Counotte, 2003). Water intake per animal and feed\nintake:water consumption ratios of modern broiler genetic\nstrains are higher when compared to non-selected broilers.\nThe growth rate capacity of modern broiler strains (around\n\nR. Bras. Zootec., v.38, n.2, p.323-327, 2009\n\n\n\nViola et al.324\n\n\u00a9 2009 Sociedade Brasileira de Zootecnia\n\n55 to 60 g/day) makes water essential. Water restriction\nreduces broiler performance (Bruno &amp; Macari, 2002). Marks\n(1981) compared non-selected and selected fast growing\ncommercial strain broilers (Cobb) and observed that water\nintake was higher for the fast growing strain, with feed and\nwater provided ad libitum. The selected strain broilers,\nrestricted to the same water intake as that of the non-\nselected strain broilers, presented worse feed conversion.\nThese findings indicate that water intake may play a major\nrole in facilitating the genetic potential for growth. Kellerup\net al. (1965) observed water restriction effects in broilers\nfrom one to eight weeks of age. Body weight and feed\nconsumption decreased with each water restriction\nincrement, but the mortality rate was not significant among\nrestriction levels (up to 50%). When ad libitum in water\nintake was reduced in 20 percent or more, feed conversion\nwas impaired. Age and increments in water restriction levels\nreduced the water:feed consumption ratio.\n\nWater restriction is related to a typical stress behavior,\nwith muscular motility coordination, modulated directly or\nnot by the neuroendocrine system (Zulkilfi &amp; Siegel, 1995).\nBieres et al. (1965) observed that water deprivation for 12\nhours or more had adverse effects on the chick growth\nperformance. Since birds are different in their ability to\nconserve body water by increasing kidney resorption, it is\npossible to cause dehydration in some birds by practicing\nwater restriction in a flock (NRC, 1994). Arad (1983) observed\nthat, after 48 hours of water deprivation, dehydrated birds\npresented slightly higher body temperature when compared\nto normally hydrated birds. Dehydrated fowls were capable\nof recovering 92% of the initial body weight within 30 min\nof drinking. However, birds that lost more than 15% of their\nweight failed to recover it. In addition, since feed intake is\nrelated to water intake, any factor interfering with feed\nintake affects water intake (Macari, 1995).\n\nThe objective of this experiment was to evaluate the\neffect of four water supply levels on broiler performance,\nbehavior, development of legs, heart, proventriculus and\ngizzard, liver and intestines, and duodenal histology and\nmorphology by scanning electron microscopy.\n\nMaterial and Methods\n\nFour hundred and eighty Ross 308 male chicks were\nsubmitted to five treatments based on water restriction\nduring a 21-day experimental period. The following\ntreatments were applied: 100% - ad libitum water supply;\n90%-90% daily water supply (10% restriction); 80%-80%\ndaily water supply (20% restriction); 70%-70% daily water\n\nsupply (30% restriction); 60%-60% daily water supply\n(40% restriction). The experiment was carried out in an\nenvironmentally controlled room, and the birds were\nhoused in battery cages measuring 0.72 m2 equipped with\nfeeders and baby drinkers (one per cage). A randomized\ncomplete block design was used, with five treatments and\nsix replicates of 14 chickens per treatment. The blocks were\nestablished based on the initial body weight. According to\nthat, chicks were divided into three weight groups (light\n\u2013 below 44.3 g, intermediate- between 44.4 and 47.2, and\nheavy- above 47.3 g).\n\nAd libitum water supply was estimated based on a\ncontrol group of six replicates of 10 chicks per replicate. The\ncontrol group was housed in battery cages in the same\nroom, two days before the beginning of the experiment. The\nchicks had the same initial weight as the experimental ones.\nWater consumption in this group was used as reference to\nestablish the amount of water to be supplied to birds from\nthe restricted treatments. In the restricted treatments, water\nwas supplied once a day, around 12:00 am. The chick\nbehavior was daily observed during water supply and for\nthe next two hours.\n\nThe same diet was offered ad libitum to chicks\nfrom all treatments. It contained 22% of crude protein,\n3100 kcal/kg of AME, 1.26% of Total Lys , 0.94% of Total\nMet-Cys, 1.0% of Calcium, and 0.5% of available\nPhosphorus. Chicks were provided 24 hours of light, and\nthe room temperature was adjusted according to the\nROSS 308 manual (AgRoss, 2000).\n\nFeed intake (FI), weight gain (WG) and feed conversion\nratio (FCR) were weekly evaluated, whereas water\nconsumption (WC) was daily evaluated. At 21 days of age,\ntwo chickens per replicate were sacrificed, and heart, liver,\nproventriculus+gizzard (P+gizzard), small+large intestine,\nand deboned leg were collected and weighed. Relative\norgan weight was calculated by dividing the weight of the\npart by the bird\u2019s body weight. The dry matter content of\norgans and legs was determined (AOAC, 1993).\n\nA third chicken per replicate was sacrificed to collect two\ncentimeters of the duodenum, at the pancreatic region. The\nsample was washed with de-ionized water and kept in plastic\nflasks, with buffered formalin at 10% in order to determine\nvilli number (VN), villi height (VH), and crypt depth (CD).\nAlso, at 7, 14 and 21 days of age, the duodenum of a fourth\nchicken was collected, washed with de-ionized water, and the\nsamples were prepared for electron microscopy reading.\n\nData were analyzed through ANOVA and regression\nanalysis, and the means were compared by Tukey test\n(SAS, 2000).\n\n\n\n325\n\n\u00a9 2009 Sociedade Brasileira de Zootecnia\n\nInfluence of water restriction on the performance and organ development of young broilers\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nThe water consumption between chicks from the control\ngroup and chicks receiving water ad libitum were\ncompared and no differences were observed. Therefore,\nkeeping birds with the same initial weight, but two days\nolder than the experimental group resulted in an acceptable\nway to estimate the water intake.\n\nThe different chick initial weights (blocks) did not show\nsignificant effect in any analysis.\n\nWeekly data are not presented because the responses\nwere quite similar to data obtained for the total experimental\nperiod (1 to 21 days). Water restriction caused severe\nreduction in broiler performance, as demonstrated in Table 1.\nData show a linear reduction (P<0.0001) of feed intake (FI)\nand weight gain (WG) as water restriction increased. As\ndemonstrated through the regression equation, for each\n1% of water restriction, 8.5 g of body weight were lost\nwithin 21 days. Nilipoul &amp; Butcher (1998) demonstrated\nthat water-restricted chickens, even if restricted for few\nhours, stop growing.\n\nThe feed conversion ratio also presented linear increase\nas water restriction levels increased. However, the\ndetermination coefficient of the regression analysis was\nlower than those of the other variables. The Tukey test also\nshowed that increases on the water restriction levels did not\nhave a clear relationship with FCR. Restriction levels of 10,\n30, and 40% resulted in equal FCR. Kellerup et al. (1965)\nfound no differences in FCR either, when chickens were\nsubmitted to 10% of water restriction. These researchers\nobserved that chickens submitted to 20 and 30% of water\nrestriction showed significant performance differences\nonly at the 7th week of age. However, when 40 and 50% of\nwater restriction was applied, differences were already\nobserved at the 4th week of age. These contradictory data\nmay be related to one of the most important factors interfering\nwith water consumption, which is genetics (Penz &amp; Vieira,\n2002). Modern strains are very different from the strain used\nby Kellerup et al. (1965), with a higher weight gain capacity.\nEach day of water restriction is meaningful for the\nperformance of modern broilers due to the lower number of\ndays required for birds to be ready for market.\n\nThe water restriction did not affect chicken livability.\nThese results are consistent with those found by Kellerup\net al. (1965). In fact, birds tried to adapt themselves to\nadverse conditions. Although the absolute weight of all\norgans and legs was reduced in function of the increment\nof water restriction levels (data not shown), Table 2 shows\nthat when the water supply levels decreased, no difference\n\nwas observed in tissue weights in relation to the body\nweight. Data indicated that the reduction in tissue weight\nwas proportional to the reduction in body weight, regardless\nthe water restriction level. Only heart relative weight (HW)\nincreased as water supply levels decreased. These results\nmay be explained by the higher blood viscosity caused by\nwater restriction. This phenomenon was visually observed\nwhen birds were sacrificed. Buhr et al. (1998) studied the\neffect of feed restriction and observed opposite results.\n\nIn terms of dry matter, only the leg dry matter increased\nwith water restriction, regardless the supply level (24.8% x\n26.4%). Davis et al. (1988) observed in newly-hatched\nchicks that leg skin is the area that undergoes the fastest\ndehydration when compared as to other areas and it is used\nas an emergency water source during osmotic stress periods,\nwhen water is lacking. Although not found in literature for\nolder broilers, this phenomenon may explain the results\nobserved.\n\nAnother evidence of coping was that treatments did\nnot affect the water intake: feed intake ratios, which were\nalways 2:1, regardless the water supply level. These ratios\nare the same as those reported in literature (NRC, 1994).\n\nWhen water is offered ad libitum, chickens develop a\nvery characteristic feed intake pattern. However, this pattern\ncan change according to the water availability and\nmanagement (Macari, 1995). In this experiment, chickens\nsubmitted to water restriction showed a non-conventional\nbehavior, which was maintained during the entire experi-\nmental period. Without water, chickens did not eat and were\nsleepy, regardless the supply level. Water restriction can\nincrease heart rate, respiratory frequency, cloacal temperature,\nin addition of causing sleepiness, pain at the body\nextremities, blood concentration increase, blood volume\n\nTable 1 - Water consumption (WC), feed intake (FI), weight gain\n(WG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of broilers\nsubmitted to different water supply levels from 1 to\n21 days of age\n\nT r e a t m e n t WC (mL) FI (g) WG (g) FCR (g/g)\n\n1 0 0 % 2 2 9 5 1 0 7 7 a 8 2 3 a 1 . 3 1 c\n9 0 % 2 0 6 6 9 8 8 b 6 9 7 b 1.42b\n8 0 % 1 8 3 6 8 7 7 c 6 1 1 c 1 . 4 4 a b\n7 0 % 1 6 0 5 7 8 8 d 5 1 7 d 1 . 5 3 a\n6 0 % 1 3 7 7 6 9 7 e 4 8 7 d 1 . 4 3 a b\nVC (%) 5 . 5 6 . 0 4 . 1\nProb.?F 0 . 0 0 0 1 0 . 0 0 0 1 0 . 0 0 0 3\n\nAverages followed by different letters in the same column are different (P<0.05)\nby Tukey test.\nFI = 9.6x+117.53, R2 =0.88, P<0.0001.\nWG = 8.51x -53.5, R2 =0.90, P<0.0001.\nFCR = -.004x+1.71, R2 =0.29, P<0.002.\n\n\n\nViola et al.326\n\n\u00a9 2009 Sociedade Brasileira de Zootecnia\n\nreduction, and blood circulation reduction. These effects\nmay cause nausea and appetite reduction (Lloyd et al.,\n1978). In the present study, in the presence of humans, the\nbirds were excited, running, and jumping into the cages.\nWhen water was offered to birds, some started to peck other\nchicken\u2019s toes. When water-restricted chickens received\nwater, they tried to drink it all very fast, in approximately two\nhours, regardless the restriction levels. It was possible to\nobserve that the limit of water consumption was the crop\nsize, which was enlarged. Chicks usually consumed feed\nafter drinking.  However, they frequently regurgitated water\ndue to the presence of feed. After satisfied of water, birds\nwere often seen watering their bodies. After eating, they\nstarted to produce excreta within two hours, in two separated\nforms (solid excreta and water, showing a rapid water transit\nand a possible decrease in its absorption). Lloyd et al.\n(1978), Yu et al. (1990), and Brooks (1994) also described\nsimilar behaviors in chickens submitted to water restriction.\n\nWater restriction did not affect villi number and crypt\ndepth. However, there was a linear reduction in villi height\n(Table 3). Dibner et al. (1996), Geyra et al. (2001), and Penz\n&amp; Vieira (2002) reported that feed nutrients are essential for\nmucosa metabolism. Since water restriction leads to a feed\nrestriction, a decrease nutrient supply to the intestine is\nexpected. Villi height is associated with a larger absorptive\nsurface due to the higher number of enterocytes capable of\nabsorbing nutrients (Geyra et al., 2001).\n\nBased on scanning electron microscopy, seven-day-\nold chicks submitted to water restriction showed cells\nextrusion from apices villi. This fact could be explained by\nthe higher abrasive affect of the diet on the villi surface in\nwater-restricted birds (Figure 1). At 14 and 21 days of age,\nthe differences were more significant and increased as the\nwater supply levels decreased (Figure 2). The villi of chicks\nnot submitted to water restriction had a smooth surface, and\n\nTable 2 - Relative organ and leg weights of 21-day-old broilers submitted to different water supply levels\n\nT r e a t m e n t Percentage in relation to the total body weight (%)\n\nHeart (HW) Leg 1 Liver I n t e s t i n e P+Gizzard2\n\n1 0 0 % 0 . 6 1 3 . 1 6 2 . 7 6 3 . 8 8 2 . 8 5\n9 0 % 0 . 6 6 3 . 0 2 2 . 7 7 4 . 0 1 3 . 1 7\n8 0 % 0 . 6 7 3 . 2 6 2 . 7 1 3 . 8 9 3 . 0 8\n7 0 % 0 . 6 8 3 . 1 1 2 . 8 5 4 . 1 6 3 . 0 7\n6 0 % 0 . 6 8 3 . 1 8 2 . 7 1 3 . 9 0 3 . 2 4\nVC (%) 9 . 7 7 . 7 9 . 1 1 2 . 9 1 1 . 2 8\nProbF 0 . 0 6 0 . 2 0 0 . 6 5 0 . 6 1 0 . 0 8\n1 Relative weight of one single leg.\n2 Proventricullus+gizzard.\nAverages followed by different letters in the same column are different by Tukey test.\nHW = -0.0016 x + 0.79,  R2  = 0.11, P<0.01.\n\n a a \n\n200 x 450x \n\nb b \n\n200 x 450x \n\nFigure 1 - a.

On the other hand, water\nrestriction up to 40% did not increase the mortality rate\nof birds kept under thermoneutral conditions.  Water\nrestriction did not reduce the weight of most of the organs\nas a proportion of the body weight, except for heart, which\nweight increased. Water restriction reduced the villi height,\nbut did not affect the villi number or crypt depth.\n\nIt is suggested that in further experiments on water\nrestriction, water should be offered often (more than once\na day) in order to prevent water spillage.\n\nLiterature Cited\n\nAGROCERES ROSS.
