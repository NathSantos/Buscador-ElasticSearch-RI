Os ecossistemas \ntropicais s\u00e3o, ao mesmo tempo, os mais diversos e os mais amea\u00e7ados, em \nparte porque muitos pa\u00edses destas regi\u00f5es emergem ainda de situa\u00e7\u00f5es de \ninstabilidade social, econ\u00f3mica e pol\u00edtica. O Brasil \u00e9 o maior pa\u00eds Neotropical, \nonde se encontram alguns dos biomas com maior diversidade e mais \namea\u00e7ados do planeta. Actualmente, \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m um pa\u00eds l\u00edder ao n\u00edvel da \nplanifica\u00e7\u00e3o e implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de medidas de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o da biodiversidade. \nV\u00e1rios dos biomas tropicais mais diversos e amea\u00e7ados encontram-se em \nterrit\u00f3rio brasileiro. Dois destes biomas, a Amaz\u00f3nia e o Cerrado, convergem \nnuma regi\u00e3o ecotonal sujeita a uma elevada press\u00e3o humana, conhecida como \no arco do desmatamento. O Araguaia, um dos maiores rios do Brasil, corre ao \nlongo desta paisagem e os efeitos do desmatamento s\u00e3o j\u00e1 evidentes em toda \na sua bacia. Por causa do acelerado ritmo de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o deste ecossistema, \ntorna-se urgente obter uma imagem clara da biodiversidade regional e \ncompreender como e se a estrat\u00e9gia de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o para esta regi\u00e3o \u00e9 capaz \nde lidar com as correntes amea\u00e7as e alcan\u00e7ar o seu objectivo a longo prazo: \nconservar a biota regional. Tendo a herpetofauna como grupo-alvo, os nossos \nobjectivos principais foram: aumentar o conhecimento das comunidades de \nanf\u00edbios e r\u00e9pteis squamata da regi\u00e3o do curso m\u00e9dio do Rio Araguaia; \ncompreender a import\u00e2ncia deste rio nos padr\u00f5es intraespec\u00edficos de estrutura \ne diversidade gen\u00e9tica para diferentes esp\u00e9cies com diferentes caracter\u00edsticas \necol\u00f3gicas; avaliar o potencial de diferentes metodologias para o estudo e \nmonitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o da herpetofauna regional. Os nossos resultados revelam que a \namostragem continuada e o uso de diferentes t\u00e9cnicas s\u00e3o essenciais para a \nobten\u00e7\u00e3o de uma imagem precisa da diversidade da herpetofauna local. As \ncomunidades locais de anf\u00edbios e lagartos apresentaram maior riqueza \nespec\u00edfica na \u00c1rea de Protec\u00e7\u00e3o Ambiental Bananal/Cant\u00e3o (APABC), uma \n\u00e1rea tamp\u00e3o, do no Parque Estadual do Cant\u00e3o (PEC), uma \u00e1rea de \nconserva\u00e7\u00e3o estrita. A APABC \u00e9 caracterizada por uma maior heterogeneidade \nde habitats e os nosso resultados corroboram a teoria da heterogeneidade \nespacial e resultados recentes que revelam uma maior diversidade de lagartos \nnas zonas interfluviais do Cerrado, do que nas matas de galeria. Os resultados \naqui apresentados n\u00e3o corroboram a hip\u00f3tese de que os ec\u00f3tonos apresentam \nmaior diversidade do que os biomas em redor. Os nossos resultados \nrevelaram ainda que o Rio Araguaia afecta de forma diferente a estrutura \ngen\u00e9tica de v\u00e1rias esp\u00e9cies de anf\u00edbios e lagartos. Estas diferen\u00e7as poder\u00e3o \nestar relacionadas com a ecologia das esp\u00e9cies, nomeadamente com o uso de \ndiferentes habitats, a vagilidade, ou a estrat\u00e9gia alimentar. Sugerimos que a \ngest\u00e3o integra\u00e7\u00e3o de diferentes unidades de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o, com diferentes \nestatutos, podem ajudar a preservar melhor a biota regional. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\nkeywords \n \n\nAmazonia, Araguaia, biodiversity, Cerrado, conservation, herpetofauna. \n \n\nabstract \n \n\nBiodiversity conservation has never been such a popular matter as in the last \ndecades, but this increasing popularity is due to the worst reason: the fast pace \nof extinction of species and habitats. Tropical ecosystems are both the most \ndiverse and most threatened, in part because many countries from these \nregions are now emerging from decades of social, economic and political \ninstability. Brazil is the largest country in the Neotropics and one of the world\u2019s \nmegadiverse countries. Nowadays, it is also a leading country in terms of \nplanning and implementing biodiversity conservation measures. Brazil harbors \nseveral of the most diverse and threatened tropical biomes. Two of them, \nAmazonia and Cerrado, converge in an ecotonal region subjected to high \nhuman pressure, known as the deforestation arc. Araguaia, one of the largest \nBrazilian rivers, runs along this landscape and the effects of deforestation are \nalready evident throughout its basin. Because of the fast pace of degradation in \nthis ecosystem, it becomes urgent to get a clear picture of the regional \nbiodiversity and understand how and if the conservation strategy for the region \nis able to cope with the current threats and accomplish its long-term objectives \nof preserving the regional biota. Having herpetofauna as the target group, our \nmain goals are: to improve the knowledge on the amphibian and lizard \nassemblages in the region of the middle Araguaia River; to understand the \nintra-specific patterns of genetic structure and diversity for different species \nwith different ecological features; to assess the potential of different \nmethodologies for the study and monitoring of the regional herpetofauna. Our \nresults revealed that continued sampling and the use of several techniques are \nessential to achieve an accurate picture of the diversity of the local \nherpetofauna. The local lizard and amphibian assemblages presented higher \nspecies richness in the \u00c1rea de Protec\u00e7\u00e3o Ambiental do Bananal/Cant\u00e3o \n(APABC), a buffer area, than in Parque Estadual do Cant\u00e3o (PEC), a strict \nconservation area. APABC is characterized by an higher habitat heterogeneity \nand our results corroborate the theory of spatial heterogeneity, as well as the \nconclusions of recent studies that reveal a higher diversity of lizards in the \ninterfluvial \u00e1reas of Cerrado, than in gallery forest. The results here presented \ndo not corroborate the hypothesis that ecotones present greater diversity than \nthe surrounding areas. Our results also reveal that River Araguaia differently \naffects the genetic structure of several species of amphibians and lizards. \nThese differences might be related with species ecology, namely with the use \nof different habitats, vagility or feeding strategy. We suggest that integrated \nmanagement of different conservation units, with different conservation \nstatuses might help to better preserve the regional biota. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nTable of Contents \n\ni \n \n\nTable of Contents \n\n \nList of Tables           iii \n\nList of Figures           iv \n\nChapter 1: General Introduction and Objectives      1 \n\nIntroduction          3 \n\nTwo Biomes: Amazonia and Cerrado       3 \n\nDeforestation, Land Use and Conservation \u00c1reas     6 \n\nThe Araguaia River Basin        9 \n\nThe Herpetofauna         10 \n\nThe Riverine Barrier Hypothesis       12 \n\nThesis Objectives         14 \n\nReferences          15 \n\nChapter 2: Biodiversity surveys in the Amazonia/Cerrado ecotone: the usefulness of \n\ndifferent methods for capturing small mammals and herpetofauna    27 \n\nAbstract          29 \n\nResumo          29 \n\nIntroduction          30 \n\nMethods          31 \n\nResults           34 \n\nDiscussion          42 \n\nAcknowledgments         46 \n\nReferences          47 \n\nChapter 3: On the usefulness of pipe refuges for studying herpetofauna in the \n\nAmazonia/Cerrado ecotone         51 \n\nAbstract          53 \n\nIntroduction          53 \n\nMethods          54 \n\nResults           56 \n\nDiscussion          58 \n\nAcknowledgments         60 \n\nReferences          60 \n\nChapter 4: On the importance of spatial heterogeneity and buffer areas in conservation: a \n\nstory by the herps of the middle Araguaia River      63 \n\nAbstract          65 \n\nIntroduction          65 \n\nMethods          69 \n\n\n\n \n \n \nTable of Contents \n\nii \n \n\nResults           73 \n\nDiscussion          80 \n\nAcknowledgments         84 \n\nReferences          85 \n\nChapter 5: Is Araguaia River a genetic barrier for amphibian populations?   91 \n\nAbstract          93 \n\nIntroduction          93 \n\nMethods          95 \n\nResults                     100 \n\nDiscussion                    106 \n\nAcknowledgments                   110 \n\nReferences                    110 \n\nSupporting Information                   116 \n\nChapter 6: Is Araguaia River a genetic barrier for lizard populations?             121 \n\nAbstract                    123 \n\nIntroduction                    124 \n\nMethods                    126 \n\nResults                     130 \n\nDiscussion                    138 \n\nAcknowledgments                   144 \n\nReferences                    144 \n\nSupporting Information                            150 \n\nChapter 7: Final Discussion                   153 \n\nOn the study and monitoring of herpetofauna                         155 \n\nThe dynamic relation between river and herps                         156 \n\nConservation areas and species assemblages                         158 \n\nIs there room for everyone?                  159 \n\nReferences                    161 \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nList of Tables \n\niii \n \n\nList of Tables \n \nTable 2.1 Capture/recapture rates given by taxa and trap type, expressed as percentage of \n\ntrap-nights number.

The destiny of millions of species is dependent on \n\nthe will of a species, with thousands of millions, which inhabits the planet and uses its \n\nresources, but not like all the other species. This species, Homo sapiens, does not adapt \nitself to the environment; it adapts the environment to its needs, at a level without known \n\nparallel in the history of the planet. \n\nRecent hypotheses about human dispersal place the Americas as the last region \n\nto be colonized by humans (Fagundes et al., 2007, 2008; Mulligan et al., 2008). Even \n\nthough, this continent was colonized long before the modern paradigm of land-use and of \n\nthe concept of natural world as a source of commodities. Contrarily to earlier believe, the \n\npeoples inhabiting Amazonia before European contact were also familiarized with plant \n\ndomestication. However, the use and management of useful plants was not based on \n\nforest clearing and crop plantation, but on \u201clandscape domestication\u201d (Clement, 2006; \n\nJunqueira et al., 2010). In Cerrado, archeological evidences suggest that hunter-gatherer \n\npeoples were the first to colonize the biome, and were dependent on native plant and \n\ngame species (Klink and Moreira, 2006). Common to both approaches was the \n\nsustainability of the coexistence between human populations and its environment. \n\nAt the present state of development, it is na\u00efve to believe that such coexistence is \n\nstill possible, or even desirable for the majority of human populations. Modern societies \n\nare dependent on domesticated plants and animals for almost everything and generally \n\nignore the importance of wild species and habitats for the survival of peripheral human \n\ncommunities (Redford and Robinson, 1991a). The success of conservation efforts will \n\ndepend on understanding and conciliating the needs of people living at the edge of these \n\npristine areas with the need to preserve biodiversity (Fragoso et al., 2004; Schmink, 2004; \n\nRudel, 2005). Meanwhile, biodiversity is being lost, sometimes even before being \n\ndiscovered (Fouquet et al., 2007). Species and ecosystems are not equally vulnerable and \n\nsome adapt themselves to a rapidly changing world; others do not. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.2 \u2013 Two Biomes: Amazonia and Cerrado \nForests used to be seen as pristine landscapes, while grasslands were traditionally \n\nconsidered as a transitional state in the succession to an equilibrium forest state (Bond \n\nand Parr, 2010). However, according to these authors, the tropical and subtropical long- \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 1 \n\n4 \n \n\n \n \nFigure 1.1 \u2013 Location of the study area (yellow dot) within the context of Amazonia (green) and \n\nCerrado (brown) biomes, and Brazilian federal units: MT \u2013 sate of Mato Grosso; PA \u2013 state of Par\u00e1; \n\nTO \u2013 state of Tocantins. Major Brazilian rivers are also depicted. \n\n \n\nstanding grasslands are better explained in a framework of alternative ecosystem states. \n\nThe main difference might be related with differences regarding shade tolerance, with \n\nshade-intolerant species dominating savannas and shade-tolerant species abounding in \n\nforests (Bond and Parr, 2010). A forest-dominated ecosystem, Amazonia, and a \n\ngrassland/savanna-dominated ecosystem, Cerrado, merge along an ecotonal region that \n\nextends throughout several thousand kilometers, in central Brazil (Figure 1.1). In addition, \n\nseveral large savanna patches occur within the Hylean forests (Ratter et al., 2006), while \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nGeneral Introduction and Objectives \n\n5 \n \n\ngallery forests extend the Amazon influence along the watercourses in Cerrado (Oliveira-\n\nFilho and Ratter, 2002). In fact, a large portion of Cerrado biome is located within the \n\nlimits of the legally defined Amazonia (Ratter et al., 2006). \n\nAmazonian rainforest is the world\u2019s largest major wilderness area (Mittermeier et \n\nal., 1998) and about two thirds of this biome are located within the Brazilian borders (Silva \n\net al., 2005). Amazonia is far from being a uniform tract of forest; rather it encompasses a \n\nwide variety of landforms such as the Andean foothills, the tepuis in the north, the \nv\u00e1rzeas, terra firme and igap\u00f3 forests (Rudel, 2005). Different areas of endemism for \nterrestrial vertebrates, separated by the major Amazonian rivers, were recognized within \n\nthe biome, of which Tapaj\u00f3s, Xing\u00fa, Bel\u00e9m and Roraima areas of endemism are \n\nexclusively or almost exclusively within Brazil (Silva et al., 2005). The climate varies along \n\nthe Amazonian biome, with a marked seasonality in rainfall in the eastern regions that is \n\nabsent in the western ones (Rudel, 2005). Amazonian habitats are largely dominated by \n\ntrees and lianas (Ribeiro et al., 1994; Ivanauskas et al., 2004). Exception is made to the \n\nsavanna enclaves that present higher proportions of grasses and shrubs, similarly to the \n\nopen formations of the Cerrado biome (Ratter et al., 1997; Filgueiras, 2007). These \n\nenclaves of Amazonian savanna are however much less diverse than the core of Cerrado \n\n(Ratter et al., 2003), which is also true for faunal communities (Gainsbury and Colli, 2003). \n\nThe natural or anthropogenic origin of Cerrado has been a matter of debate \n\n(Ledru, 2002). There are strong evidences of a worldwide expansion of tropical and \n\nsubtropical grasslands and savannas dominated by C4 grasses (such as Cerrado), \n\nstarting around 8 million years ago, after a global decrease of atmospheric CO2 (Cerling et \n\nal., 1997; Mayle et al., 2004; Simon et al., 2009; Bond and Parr, 2010). On the other hand, \n\npalynological records suggest that the earliest record of cerrado-type vegetation in Brazil \n\ndates back to 32,000 years before present, in the Central Brazilian Plateau (Ledru, 2002). \n\nEven though, according to this author, the fire-adapted vegetation of Cerrado probably \n\nexisted before people arrived to South America. In either way, Cerrado is considered a \n\nglobal biodiversity hotspot for plants and vertebrates (Mittermeier et al., 1998; Myers et al., \n\n2000). Species richness estimates for the Cerrado woody flora point to 950 to 1000 \n\nspecies, but the biome is widely dominated by only a small fraction of this assemblage \n\n(Ratter et al., 2003; Bridgewater et al., 2004). A strong geographical pattern in the \n\ndistribution of the flora was found in Cerrado, which allowed the recognition of several \n\ndistinct floristic regions within this biome (Oliveira-Filho and Ratter, 2002; Ratter et al., \n\n2003). The Cerrado biome comprises several physiognomies ranging from grasslands \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 1 \n\n6 \n \n\nwith or without trees (campo sujo or campo limpo, respectively), to gradually more \nforested areas (campo cerrado and cerrado sensu stricto) until almost closed woodland \n(cerrad\u00e3o) areas (Oliveira-Filho and Ratter, 2002). The previous physiognomies are \npresent in dry areas but Cerrado also includes gallery forests along the watercourses, and \n\nseasonally flooded forests and grasslands (Oliveira-Filho and Ratter, 2002).  \n\n \n\n \n\n1.3 \u2013 Deforestation, Land Use and Conservation Areas \n\nHabitat fragmentation is one of the major causes of worldwide current biodiversity \n\ncrisis (e.g., Skole and Tucker, 1993; Anderson and Jenkins, 2006), and the current main \n\ncause of habitat loss and fragmentation in tropical areas is deforestation. Recent studies \n\nshowed that deforestation altered the patterns of species richness, diversity and \n\nabundance of the herpetofauna (Gardner et al., 2006; Bernarde and Macedo, 2008; Cano \n\nand Leynaud, 2010). On the other hand, some studies reveal that low-scale selective \n\nlogging activities (Vallan et al., 2004) or silvicultural activities (Lopes, 2010) might present \n\nlow impact on local herpetofauna. \n\nTotal deforested area, and sometimes the deforestation rates, is higher in Cerrado \n\nthan in Amazonia (Klink and Machado, 2005). Estimates of total deforested area in \n\nCerrado vary between 39% (Sano et al., 2010) and 80% (Myers et al., 2000), depending \n\non the criterion: only clear cutted areas; clear cutted and edge areas; or all areas under \n\nhuman influence, such as natural pastures. Considering the most optimistic estimative, if \n\nsecondary growth forests and exploited native pastures are included as areas under direct \n\nhuman intervention, then the lower threshold rises to 53%, approaching the estimates \n\nprovided by Klink and Machado (2005). In the year of 1988, estimates of effectively \n\ndeforested area in Amazonia corresponded to 6% of the total area of the biome, but the \n\narea affected by deforestation was already about 15% (Skole and Tucker, 1993). \n\nCumulative deforested area in Legal Amazonia, which includes areas covered by Cerrado, \n\nreached 17% in the year of 2006 and most of the deforestation was concentrated in the \n\nborder between Amazonia and Cerrado (Reid and Sousa, 2005; Foley et al., 2007). This \n\narea is known as the Deforestation Arc (Figure 1.2), which extends along the eastern and \n\nsouthern borders of Amazonia, cutting through the states of Maranh\u00e3o, Tocantins, Par\u00e1, \n\nMato Grosso, Rond\u00f4nia, Acre and Amazonas (Vieira et al, 2008).  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nGeneral Introduction and Objectives \n\n7 \n \n\n \nFigure 1.2 \u2013 Deforested areas within Legal Amazonia boundaries. The region known as \n\ndeforestation arc corresponds to the continuous deforested area (yellow and purple) extending \n\nfrom S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds (state of Maranh\u00e3o) to Rio Branco (state of Acre). Reproduced with permission \n\nfrom Girardi (2008). \n\n \n\nOne of the reasons for the difference between the deforestation rates in the two \n\nbiomes is that the Brazilian law (Klink and Machado, 2005). According to these authors, \n\nthe latter requires that 80% of each holding in Amazonia should be preserved, but in \n\nCerrado, this percentage is only 20%. In Cerrado, higher deforestation rates are reported \n\nfor the southern states were only 13 to 32% of native areas still remain intact (Sano et al., \n\n2010). According to the same authors, Tocantins is the northern state with the greatest \n\npercent of deforested areas (21%). In Amazonia, deforestation rates also vary among the \n\nmajor endemism areas (Silva et al., 2005). The Xingu area of endemism, at the core of the \n\ndeforestation arc (Figure 1.2), is the most severely affected area, with almost 27% of its \n\nnative area already converted for human use (Silva et al., 2005). \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 1 \n\n8 \n \n\nThe most frequently appointed causes for deforestation are extensive agriculture \n\nand cattle ranching (Klink and Moreira, 2002; Fearnside, 2005; Vieira et al., 2008). In a \n\nrecent study in the Cerrado biome, Carvalho and collaborators (2009) concluded that \n\ncroplands are more damaging than pasturelands for the conservation of biodiversity. The \n\nsoils under Cerrado and Amazonia are relatively infertile (Klink and Moreira, 2002; \n\nStepan, 2006) and, in a context of large-scale crop and cattle production, cleared areas \n\nsoon become exhausted and new large areas must be cleared. Other related causes for \n\ndeforestation have also been suggested, and Fearnside (2005) pointed the role of clearing \n\nin the establishment of land claims as one of the root problems. In addition, government \n\nloans and subsidies were primarily oriented to large-scale agriculture and logging \n\nactivities, and allocated based on the size of planted area, encouraging extensive and \n\ninefficient agriculture practices (Klink and Moreira, 2002; Rudel, 2005; Clement, 2006). \n\nIn this not very encouraging context, the great effort of Brazilian researchers, \n\nconservation professionals and governments in establishing a large and effective \n\nconservation program must be recognized (Rylands and Brandon, 2005). Brazil\u2019s present \n\nsystem of protected areas includes strictly protected areas, such as parks, biological \n\nreserves and ecological stations; and sustainable use areas, which allow different types \n\nand levels of human use, and include national forests, environmental protection areas and \n\nextractive reserves, among others (Rylands and Brandon, 2005). According to these \n\nauthors, in 2005, there were 478 federal and state strictly protected areas and 436 \n\nsustainable-use areas, covering an area of about 37 million and 74.6 million hectares, \n\nrespectively. Recent data from the Program of Amazonian Protected Areas (ARPA) reveal \n\nthat 31 strict conservation areas and 30 conservation areas for sustainable use are \n\npresently included in this program, covering 32 million hectares of Amazonian forest \n\n(ARPA, 2011). \n\nAs suggested by Peres (2004), the long-term persistence of the Amazonian biome \n\ndepends on a large and integrated system of strict conservation and sustainable use \n\nareas. Unfortunately, in the Amazonian area of endemism of Xingu, for example, only \n\n0.29% is under strict protection and 2.72% are sustainable use areas (Silva et al., 2005). \n\nIn the latter case, according to the authors, if indigenous areas are considered, 27.1% of \n\nthis region is somehow preserved. The situation is not better in Cerrado, where only about \n\n2.2% of its total extent is under any legal conservation statuses (Klink &amp; Machado, 2005). \n\nConservation efforts could benefit from the integration of indigenous and smallholder \n\ncommunities, and some successful cases where reported, resulting in the conservation of \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nGeneral Introduction and Objectives \n\n9 \n \n\nvery large areas (Silvius, 2004; Campos and Nepstad, 2005). Large efforts for integrated \n\nprotection of large extents of pristine areas are also being conducted by Brazilian \n\nconservation agencies, universities and international non-governmental organizations, by \n\npromoting the creation of ecological corridors. Some examples are: the \u201cCorredor Jalap\u00e3o \n\n\u2013 Oeste da Bahia\u201d, in the transition between Cerrado and Caatinga biomes, in the border \n\nof the states of Tocantins, Piau\u00ed, Maranh\u00e3o and Bahia; or the \u201cCorredor Sul da Amaz\u00f4nia\u201d, \n\nwhich includes all the forests located between the right margin of Madeira River and the \n\ncentral region of the state of Maranh\u00e3o (CI-Brasil, 2011). \n\n \n\n \n\n1.4 \u2013 The Araguaia River Basin \nThe Araguaia River (Figure 1.1) is the main fluvial system in Cerrado and, together \n\nwith Tocantins River, constitutes the fourth largest drainage basin of South America \n\n(Aquino et al., 2008; Latrubesse et al., 2009). The basin extends through both Amazonia \n\nand Cerrado biomes (Aquino et al., 2008). Araguaia presents an anabranching pattern \n\nthat is characteristic of many large rivers (Latrubesse, 2008). Anabranching rivers consist \n\nof multiple channels separated by vegetated semi-permanent alluvial islands excised from \n\npreexisting floodplain or formed by within-channel or deltaic accretion (Nanson and \n\nKnighton, 1996). \n\nThe Araguaia basin was recognized as a priority area for conservation (Azevedo-\n\nRamos and Galatti, 2002; Cavalcanti and Joly, 2002), and a plant diversity hotspot that, \n\ndespite the outlying location, is mainly composed of typical Cerrado species (Oliveira-Filho \n\nand Ratter, 2002). The area is now the core of political, scientific and social debates, \n\nbecause of the intensive deforestation in Cerrado and the expansion of agribusiness in the \n\nregion (Aquino et al., 2008). One of the controversial issues is related with the damming \n\nprojects for Araguaia, which is one of the last undammed large rivers in Brazil (Reid and \n\nSousa, 2005; Latrubesse et al., 2009). \n\nRiver damming can have direct impact on local fauna and habitats (Fearnside, \n\n2001; Brand\u00e3o and Ara\u00fajo, 2008). Dams can degrade socially valued riverine and riparian \n\necosystems, and the services they provide (Esselman and Opperman, 2010). As an \n\nexample of direct impacts on fauna, dam-induced changes such as siltation of ponds, \n\nincreased water velocities and lowered water temperatures were shown to be pottentially \n\ndeleterious to turtle populations (Reese, 1996). Flooding of dam reservoir also may lead to \n\ndepletion of amphibian species in local amphibian communities in the islands formed from \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 1 \n\n10 \n \n\nhill remnants, during the flooding of the reservoir (Brand\u00e3o and Ara\u00fajo, 2008). Habitat \n\nalteration caused by river damming was also shown to negatively affect native amphibian \n\nspecies, while promoting dominance by invasive species like Rana catesbeiana (Fuller et \nal, 2010). \n\nHowever, direct human intervention in Araguaia is just one of the matters of \n\nconcern. There are evidences that deforestation in Cerrado is triggering erosion all over \n\nthe basin of Araguaia and other Brazilian rivers (Coe et al., 2009; Latrubesse et al., 2009; \n\nCoe et al., 2011) and this erosion has been affecting mostly large arboreal vegetation in \n\nthe floodplain (Latrubesse and Stevaux, 2006). The middle Araguaia extends for 1160Km \n\nand corresponds to 79% of its total drainage area (Aquino et al., 2008). The floodplains in \n\nthe middle river course retain about 30% of Araguaia\u2019s output during the flooding season, \n\nin part because of a complex lake system and because of the arboreal vegetation that \n\nslows down the flooding wave (Aquino et al., 2008). The question remains on how this \n\ndynamic is going to be affected by deforestation in the long term. Changes in land-cover \n\nare changing hydrology (Klink and Machado, 2005). The Araguaia basin still ensures the \n\npreservation of large Cerrado remnants (Latrubesse et al., 2009) but, in the long-term, this \n\nrole might be compromised by the present deforestation rates. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.5 \u2013 The Herpetofauna \nTropical regions present particularly rich amphibian and reptile faunas. Among \n\namphibian taxa, the highest diversity of anurans and caecilians is found in the tropics, and \n\nonly order Caudata is more diverse in temperate climates (Duellman, 1994; Wells, 2007). \n\nAll reptilian taxa are represented in the tropics and some, such as crocodilians and \n\nseveral squamate families, are more diverse or even restricted to tropical and subtropical \n\nregions (Zug et al., 2001; Pough et al 2004). According to the Brazilian Society of \n\nHerpetology, there are currently 877 recognized species of amphibians (SBH, 2011a) and \n\n721 recognized species of reptiles (SBH, 2011b), known to occur in Brazil, with several \n\nnew species being described each year. \n\nSeveral taxonomic rearrangements of squamate and amphibian taxa have been \n\nproposed in the last years, directly affecting the taxonomy of Neotropical taxa. The \n\nrearrangements included the establishment of new families, genera and species and the \n\nreplacement and splitting of previously non-monophyletic taxa. Some examples are: \n\nHylidae  (Faivovich et al., 2005); Amphibia (Frost et al., 2006); Dendrobatidae and close \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nGeneral Introduction and Objectives \n\n11 \n \n\nrelatives (Grant et al., 2006); Gekkota (Gamble et al., 2007); Terrarana (Hedges et al., \n\n2008); or snakes (Adalsteinsson et al 2009; Zaher et al., 2009). \n\n All the three groups of extant amphibians are present in Brazil, but anuran taxa \n\nare hegemonic in all biomes, both in the number of species, as in the number of families \n\n(Colli et al., 2002; Azevedo-Ramos &amp; Gallati, 2002; Rodrigues, 2003; Avila-Pires et al., \n\n2007; Cruz and Feio, 2007; Str\u00fcssman et al., 2007). The order Gymnophiona is \n\nrepresented by two families \u2013 Caeciliidae (26 species) and Rhinatrematidae (one species) \n\n\u2013 and the plethodontid Bolitoglossa paraensis is the only representative of order Caudata \n(SBH, 2010a). On the other hand, anurans constitute more than 96% of all amphibian \n\nspecies in Brazil, distributed into 19 families. The most diverse family of anurans in Brazil \n\nis by far the family Hylidae, with 339 recognized species, followed by: Leptodactylidae \n\n(74), Cycloramphidae (68), Bufonidae (67) and Leiuperidae (55) (SBH, 2010a). The same \n\npattern also occurs in Cerrado and Amazonia, where hylids and leptodactylids are the \n\nmost numerous families (Colli et al., 2002; Bastos, 2007; \u00c1vila-Pires et al, 2007) \n\nMost of world\u2019s non-avian reptilian species are squamates (Pough et al., 2004) and \n\nthe same occurs for Brazilian biomes (Colli et al 2002; \u00c1vila-Pires et al 2007; Rodrigues, \n\n2003). Brazilian herpetofauna includes six crocodilian species, all from family \n\nAlligatoridae, and 36 chelonian species, distributed into eight families, including marine, \n\nterrestrial and fresh water representatives (SBH, 2010b). However, these two ancient taxa \n\nare outnumbered by squamates, which include 67 species of amphisbanids, 241 species \n\nof lizards and 371 species of snakes (SBH, 2010b). Autarchoglossa (133) is the most \n\ndiverse lizard group, followed by Iguania (73) and Gekkota (34). At the family level, \n\nGymnophtalmidae leads the ranking, with 82 valid species (SBH, 2010b). In Amazonia, \n\nthis family also presents the highest number of species (\u00c1vila-Pires, 2007), but the \n\ndiversity of lizards in Cerrado is more evenly distributed, with Teiidae being the most \n\nspeciose group (Colli et al., 2002).  \n\nHigher species richness does not warrant a higher perceived importance. Despite \n\namphibian and squamate species clearly outnumber chelonians and crocodilians, the \n\nlatter two groups are more familiar to common people in South America. In fact, they are \n\nthe economically most important reptile taxa in the Neotropics (Redford and Robinson, \n\n1991b; Vichers, 1991; Fach\u00edn-Teran et al., 2004; Seijas, 2004; Verdade and Pi\u00f1a, 2007). \n\nThe same patern is verified locally, in the middle Araguaia basin, where turtles and their \n\neggs are frequently consumed (Salera Jr., 2005; Salera Jr. et al., 2007; Ata\u00eddes 2009), as \n\nwell as crocodilian meat, as reported by local people. \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 1 \n\n12 \n \n\nLarge lizards, like iguanas or teiids, are important for some human communities in \n\nthe Neotropics, as a protein source (meat and eggs) but also as a source of monetary \n\nincome, because of skin trade (Fitzgerald et al., 1991; Werner, 1991; Fitzgerald et al. \n\n1994). Some anuran species are also used for human consumption (Pough et al., 2004), \n\nwhich is the case of the large Leptodactylus species, in the Araguaia basin. Toxins from \nfrog skins are traditionally used in rituals or hunting by indigenous people in the Amazon \n\nbasin (Myers et al., 1978, Daly et al., 1992). Presently, amphibian toxins are also being \n\nused in medical and pharmaceutical research (Shwartz et al., 2007). Moreover, \n\namphibians, lizards and snakes are much appreciated in the international pet market \n\n(Schlaepfer et al., 2005; Wells, 2007). \n\nThe first works about Cerrado herpetofauna (Duellman, 1979; Vanzolini, 1998; \n\nSites, 1995) suggested its low differentiation, rate of endemism and lack of \n\ndistinctiveness, but Colli and collaborators (2002) refuted these claims, stating that the \n\nhorizontal habitat variability in Cerrado balanced the vertical variability typical of forested \n\nhabitats, resulting in similar levels of local species richness. Recent studies reporting the \n\nhighly habitat-structured nature of lizard assemblages in Cerrado supported this view \n\n(Nogueira et al., 2005; Costa et al., 2007; Nogueira et al., 2009). Some studies point to a \n\ngreater diversity of anurans in the central and southeastern regions of Cerrado (Diniz-\n\nFilho et al., 2006, 2007) but Bini and collaborators (2006) suggest that a more intense \n\nsampling in the northern areas of the biome would probably expand the distribution of \n\nknown anuran species and eventually contribute with the description of new species. In \n\nthe case of Amazonia, Avila-Pires (1995) and Azevedo-Ramos and Galatti (2002) \n\nsuggested the existence of distinctive amphibian and lizard assemblages across the \n\nbiome. Vitt and collaborators (1999) found that Amazonian herpetofauna was also \n\nstructured relatively to microhabitat and diet. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.6 \u2013 The Riverine Barrier Hypothesis \n\nThe herps from the mid-Araguaia basin live in a river-dominated landscape. \n\nBesides the Araguaia itself, two major tributaries are present in this area: Coco and \n\nJava\u00e9s. The idea that these rivers could play an important role in the evolutionary history \n\nof herps is easily born in mind. However, this idea is not new. The role of rivers as barriers \n\nto animal populations and, thus, as a mechanism responsible for the diversification of the \n\nAmazonian fauna, was first formally proposed as the \u201cRiverine Barrier Hypothesis\u201d, in \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nGeneral Introduction and Objectives \n\n13 \n \n\n1852, by Alfred Russell Wallace (Colwell, 2000). The idea that rivers could have shaped \n\nAmazonian biodiversity resulted from the observation that: (1) large rivers are common in \n\nthe Neotropics since the Pleistocene; (2) they dissect the tropical forest in fragments of \n\nvarious sizes (Gascon et al., 1998); (3) and different species occurred in opposite banks \n\nof the same river. Several alternative hypotheses for the diversification of Amazonian \n\ndiversity were proposed since then and reviews on this subject are available (Haffer, \n\n1997; Moritz et al., 2000; Zeisset &amp; Beebee, 2008; Haffer, 2008; Antonelli et al., 2010). \n\nSome authors elaborated predictions that should be proven true, in the case of \n\nriver-mediated diversification (Haffer, 1997; Moritz et al, 2000; Patton et al., 2000). For \n\nexample, Patton et al (2000) suggested three possible scenarios of river mediated \n\ndivergence: (1) reciprocally monophyletic and sister clades on opposite sides of the river \n\nwould indicate primary diversification; (2) reciprocally monophyletic but not sister clades \n\non opposite sides of the river would suggest secondary contact; (3) paraphyletic \n\nrelationship from one bank relatively to the other would correspond to an event of \n\ndispersal across the river. \n\nPatterns of species distribution or the phylogenetic patterns of vertebrate species \n\nsometimes appeared to fit the predictions of the Riverine Barrier Hypothesis. Some \n\nexamples are: the distribution patterns of amphibians and other vertebrate groups in \n\nlowland Amazonia (Ron, 2000); and the phylogenetic patterns of amphibians (Noonan and \n\nWray, 2006; Funk et al, 2007), lizards (Pellegrino et al., 2005; Rodriguez-Robles et al., \n\n2008), birds (Bates et al., 2004), tamarins and rodents (Patton et al, 2000). However, \n\nseveral other (or even the same) studies reveal examples of distribution and phylogenetic \n\npatterns that contradict the predictions of this hypothesis (Gascon et al., 1998; Lougheed \n\net al., 1999; Gascon et al., 2000; Patton et al., 2000; Symula et al., 2003). Several authors \n\nagree that no single model could adequately explain Amazonian diversity, and that \n\ndifferent mechanisms should be relevant in speciation processes of different faunal groups \n\n(Noonan and Wray, 2006; Zeisset and Beebee, 2008; Haffer, 2008; Antonelli et al., 2010). \n\nAlternative hypothesis for the origin of the Neotropical diversity have been tested in \n\nthe last years. For example, the hypothesis of the Pleistocene refuge received support \n\nfrom the study by Carnaval and Moritz (2008), who found that paleoclimate modelling \n\npredicted the presence of historical refugia that matched current centres of endemism and \n\nbiodiversity patterns. On a different study, Carnaval et al. (2009) found that areas of \n\nhistorical stability within Atlantic Forest presented higher genetic diversity than populations \n\nfrom unstable areas, providing support for the Pleistocene refuge hypothesis. Some \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 1 \n\n14 \n \n\nsupport was also found for the role of Pleistocene climatic fluctuations in shaping \n\nphlylogeographic pattern and historical demography of the Neotropical rattlesnake, \n\nCrotalus durissus (W\u00fcster et al., 2005; Quijada-Mascare\u00f1as et al., 2007). However, \nevidence from Amazonian lizard and amphibian taxa showed that, in the studied cases, \n\ninterspecific, and even intraspecific diversification occurred well before the Pleistocene, \n\ndismissing the Pleistocene refugia as the mechanism for Amazonian diversification (Glor, \n\n2001; Elmer et al. 2007; Gamble et al., 2008). There is also recent evidence contradicting \n\nthe influence of historical refugia in the diversification of an Atlantic forest anuran (Thom\u00e9 \n\net al., 2010). An alternative hypothesis, the disturbance-vicariance hypothesis, received \n\nsome support from the study of the phylogeographic patterns of the poison frog \n\nDendrobates tinctorius (Noonan and Gaucher, 2006). Several authors agree that no single \nmodel could adequately explain Amazonian diversity, and that different mechanisms \n\nshould be relevant in speciation processes of different faunal groups (Noonan and Wray, \n\n2006; Zeisset and Beebee, 2008; Haffer, 2008; Antonelli et al., 2010). \n\n \n\n \n\n1.7 \u2013 Thesis Objectives \n\nIn face of the intensification of deforestation and agriculture pressure in Cerrado \n\nand Amazonia, most precisely in the deforestation arc and the transitional area between \n\nthese two biomes, it becomes essential to have a clear picture of the regional biodiversity. \n\nThere are plans for the establishment of a corridor of conservation areas in the middle \n\nAraguaia basin, involving several parks, sustainable use and indigenous areas, which also \n\nrequires understanding how and if the conservation strategy for the region will be able to \n\ncope with the current threats and accomplish its long-term objectives of preserving the \n\nregional biodiversity.  \n\nHaving this in mind, and choosing herpetofauna as the target faunal group, our \n\nmain objectives are: to improve the knowledge on the amphibian and lizard assemblages \n\nin the region of the middle Araguaia River, namely how these are distributed across \n\ndifferent conservation areas with different conservation statuses; to understand the intra-\n\nspecific patterns of genetic structure and diversity for different species with different \n\necological features, within this region; and to to assess the potential of different \n\nmethodologies for the study and monitoring of the regional herpetofauna. \n\nI begin this thesis by this general introduction (Chapter I) with the aim of providing \n\na better picture of the region of the mid-Araguaia basin. I tried to cover different aspects \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nGeneral Introduction and Objectives \n\n15 \n \n\nthat I considered relevant in the context of this thesis: the two merging biomes; the \n\neconomic and political context with focus on land use, current threats and conservation \n\nunits; the characterization of the Araguaia hydrodynamics and the human impacts upon it; \n\nthe characterization of the herpetofauna of Cerrado and Amazonia, within the Brazilian \n\ncontext, and finally the potential influence of rivers upon species diversification. Chapters \n\nII and III are presented with the objective of providing some information on the methods \n\nused during the collection of biological data. Fieldwork occupied more than two years of \n\nthis study and is generally one of the most time-consuming tasks when studying \n\nbiodiversity. We hope that the systematization of this kind of information might prove to be \n\nvaluable for future researchers. Chapter IV focus on the distribution of amphibian and \n\nsquamate species across the different conservation units, in an attempt to understand \n\nwhat is in fact being preserved and what is being left at the mercy of the fast-growing \n\nregional development. Chapters V and VI are focused on the role of the Araguaia on the \n\ndiversification, respectively, of amphibian and lizard populations. In Chapter VII I try to \n\nsummarize the main findings of the previous chapters and integrate them again in the \n\nlarger context of the mid-Araguaia basin. \n\n \n\n \n\nReferences \nAdalsteinsson S.A., Branch W.R., Trape S., Vitt L.J. and Hedges S.B.

We also \n\nevaluated if these methods alone accurately estimated local species richness, by using \n\nadditional methods. Sixty-seven small vertebrate species were captured. Larger pitfalls \n\nwere significantly more efficient than smaller ones. We also found significant differences \n\namong live traps and between live traps and pitfalls, at the family level. Pitfalls were the \n\nless selective method and might reveal very useful even in short-term biodiversity surveys. \n\nAdditional sampling methods substantially increased the number of captured species. We \n\nsuggest that it is important to diversify capture methodology and that variation within taxa \n\nmust be considered when designing sampling strategy, or biodiversity will be \n\nunderestimated. \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords: active search; Brazil; capture efficiency; live traps; pipe refuges; pitfalls. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2. \u2013 Resumo \nA fauna de pequenos mam\u00edferos e a herpetofauna do ec\u00f3tono Amaz\u00f4nia/Cerrado \n\nfoi amostrada e a efici\u00eancia de captura de armadilhas Sherman, Tomahawk e e \n\narmadilhas de queda foi comparada.

(2000), and Amazonian Rainforest is \n\nconsidered the largest and most diverse major tropical wilderness area (Mittermeier et al. \n\n1998). These are the two largest Brazilian biomes (Klink &amp; Machado 2005) and converge \n\nalong a large ecotonal region in central Brazil, which is considered a conservation priority \n\narea (Azevedo-Ramos &amp; Gallati 2002; Cavalcanti &amp; Joli 2002). Despite its perceived \n\nimportance, there is a generalized deficiency of sampling data in this area, common \n\nthroughout the northern region of Cerrado (Marinho-Filho et al. 2002; Bini et al. 2006). \n\nBiodiversity surveys and complete species lists depend on efficient capture techniques. \n\nCareful evaluation of various techniques by experienced wildlife biologists is the key for \n\nsuccessful capture programs (Schemnitz 1996). When available, published data about the \n\nefficiency of different methods could help to identify suitable techniques. Several studies \n\nabout capture methodology were conducted in Amazonian Rainforest (Malcolm 1991; \n\nVoss &amp; Emmons 1996; Woodman et al. 1996; Vieira 1998; Hice &amp; Schmidly 2002; \n\nLambert et al. 2005), but only a few exist for Cerrado, and only for the southern region of \n\nthis biome (Cechin &amp; Martins 2000; Vieira et al. 2004; Caceres et al. 2011). \n\nSeveral factors can influence capture success: incidence and amount of \n\nprecipitation (Gibbons &amp; Bennett 1974); closed versus mesh trap (O\u2019Farrell et al. 1994); \nsize of the trap and mass of captured individuals (Slade et al. 1993); trap-habit and trap-\n\navoidance (Sealander &amp; James 1958); size of individuals and taxonomic group \n\n(Crosswhite et al. 1999) or ecological features across taxa (Malcolm 1991; Greenberg et \n\nal. 1994; Leite et al. 1996; Lambert et al. 2005). Generally, the simultaneous use of more \n\nthan one method would help to increase the number of captured species (Mengak &amp; Guyn \n\n1987; Greenberg et al. 1994; Voss &amp; Emmons 1996; Crosswhite et al. 1999). \n\nStudies comparing different capture methods are normally developed within a \n\nparticular region with a characteristic species assemblage. When extrapolating capture \n\nefficiency results from one area to another, wildlife professionals are confronted with \n\ndifferent, but sometimes close, taxonomic assemblages. Therefore, comparisons made at \n\nhigher taxonomical level, rather than species level, might be more useful. The aims of this \n\nstudy were: to survey small mammals and herpetofauna in the Amazonia/Cerrado \n\necotone; and to compare the capture efficiency of live traps (Sherman and Tomahawk \n\ntraps) and pitfalls of two different sizes for different families of these vertebrate taxa. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nCapturing Small Mammals and Herpetofauna \n\n31 \n \n\nMoreover, additional methods (active search and pipe traps) were also used to evaluate if \n\nlive traps and pitfalls alone accurately estimate local species richness. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4 \u2013 Methods \n \n2.4.1 \u2013 Study Area \n\nThis study was conducted in two conservation areas in the western region of the \n\nstate of Tocantins, Central Brazil: Parque Estadual do Cant\u00e3o (PEC) and the surrounding \n\n\u00c1rea de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o Ambiental Bananal/Cant\u00e3o (APABC). Fazenda Santa F\u00e9 (FSF) in the \n\nstate of Par\u00e1 \u2013 a nearby private ranch (65,000ha) without official conservation status \u2013 \n\nwas also sampled. PEC (90,000ha) is a state natural reserve and APABC (1,700,000ha) \n\nis a conservation buffer area, where limited human activities (e.g. farming and forestry) \n\nare allowed. This buffer area surrounds PEC and the nearby Parque Nacional do \n\nAraguaia (PNA). A large river complex dominated by the Araguaia River, a natural border \n\nbetween the states of Tocantins and Par\u00e1, characterizes the area. The study area is \n\nlocated in the ecotonal region between the Cerrados from central Brazil and the \n\nAmazonian Rainforest, and is mainly composed of alluvial forests and, in a lesser extent, \n\nwell-drained areas with more typical Cerrado sensu lato physiognomies (Oliveira-Filho &amp; \nRatter 2002). Seasonally flooded areas occupy most of PEC, and permanently dry areas \n\nare mostly located outside the park, in APABC and in the western margin of river \n\nAraguaia, state of Par\u00e1. Climate in this region of Brazil is tropical, with a rain season from \n\nOctober to April and a dry season from May to September (INMET 2010). \n\n \n\n2.4.2 \u2013 Sampling \nTwo trapping methods were used: pitfalls (approximately 30L \u2013 diameter 32cm/height \n\n38cm; and approximately 60L \u2013 diameter 38cm/height 54cm) with plastic drift fences \n\n(50cm height and 5m long) and live traps (Tomahawk \u2013 45x21x21cm \u2013 and Sherman \n\ntraps \u2013 45x12.5x14.5cm). Four smaller sub-areas within the study area were sampled, \n\neach with five sampling points established at least 2 Km apart. Fourteen sampling points \n\nwere established inside PEC and six in the surrounding areas. Sampling design at each \n\npoint (Figure 2.1), consisted of: a line of sixteen 30L pitfalls with drift fences; a line of ten \n\n60L pitfalls with drift fences; a mixed line with 22 Sherman traps and 10 Tomahawk traps. \n\nLines were placed at least 150m apart. Sampling design for pitfall lines was based on a \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 2 \n\n32 \n \n\nmodel proposed by A.P. Carmignotto (pers. comm.). Traps were checked daily, at early \n\nmorning, to avoid desiccation of captured individuals. Water was added to pitfalls also to \n\navoid desiccation, but without causing the drowning of small mammals, as reported earlier \n\nby Mengak &amp; Guyn (1987). Excess water was removed after heavy rain. A small piece of \n\nwood or stone was placed inside the buckets to provide a dry surface for small mammals \n\nand lizards. Arthropods, mainly arachnids and ants, were removed from pitfalls, because \n\nthey frequently preyed on vertebrates inside the buckets. Adding water also helped reduce \n\nvertebrate mortality caused by arthropods. Live traps were baited with peanut butter and \n\npineapple and the bait was replaced every two days. At the end of each sampling period, \n\nbuckets were closed, to prevent accidental death or injury of animals in the area, and live \n\ntraps were removed. \n\n \nFigure 2.1 \u2013 Sampling design used in each one of the 20 sampling points. Lines of pitfalls and live \n\ntraps were placed at least 150m apart \n\n \n\nSampling was carried out between June 2007 and November 2008. Three \n\nsampling periods averaging seven nights (range 5\u20139 nights) were performed for each \n\narea: 1) at the end of the rain season (June to July 2007; May to June 2008); 2) during the \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nCapturing Small Mammals and Herpetofauna \n\n33 \n \n\ndry season (August to September 2007 and 2008); 3) at the beginning of the following rain \n\nseason (October to November 2007 and 2008). Each sub area was sampled separately. \n\nTime intervals between consecutive samplings in the same area varied between one and \n\na half and two months. We did not sample during the rain season since most of the area \n\nremains flooded. Small inconsistencies in trap-night numbers across methods were due to \n\ndamaging of traps by wild animals or removal by local people. We also used active search \n\nand PVC pipe traps (tree pipe traps: 40cm long, adapted from Jonhson [2005]; lake pipe \n\ntraps: 80cm long) as additional methods for surveying other species present in the area, \n\nbut these methods were not used for statistical comparisons in this study. \n\n \n\n2.4.3 \u2013 Collecting and Marking \nAll vertebrates captured in the traps (except snakes and some accidentally \n\ncaptured birds) were weighed with a digital scale (precision 0.1g) or with a spring scale \n\n(precision 20g), and identified to genus/species level, whenever possible. Individuals not \n\nidentified in the field, as well as the first ones of each species caught, were collected as \n\nvoucher specimens and deposited in \u201cCole\u00e7\u00e3o de Mam\u00edferos da Universidade Federal do \n\nEsp\u00edrito Santo\u201d and \u201cCole\u00e7\u00e3o Herpetol\u00f3gica da Universidade de Bras\u00edlia\u201d (CHUNB). All \n\nother individuals were individually marked and released. Small mammals were marked \n\nwith ear-tags and amphibians and lizards were marked with visible implant elastomer \n\n(VIE). All procedures were performed according to Brazilian national laws and guidelines. \n\nFieldwork was carried out with permits from the federal (ICMBIO, permits: 200/2006; \n\n036/2007; 13546-3 and 14307-1) and state (NATURATINS, permits: 019/2006; 009/2007 \n\nand 001/2008) conservancy agencies. \n\n \n\n2.4.4 \u2013 Data Analysis \nCapture data from all sampling points and periods were pooled by type of trap (30L \n\nor 60L pitfall and Sherman or Tomahawk), family and species. Only first captures of each \n\nindividual, in each method, were included in odds-ratio analysis and graphical weight \n\nanalysis. If an individual was captured more than once by the same method, it was \n\nconsidered a recapture. Capture and recapture rates (expressed as percentages) were \n\ncalculated as the ratio of capture and recapture numbers over total trap-night numbers. \n\nCaptured individuals were classified by weight. Eight classes ranging from 0 to \n\n2187g were defined according to a geometric series with base 3: [0\u201330:36\u201337]. Species \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 2 \n\n34 \n \n\ncapture rates (capture/1000 trap-nights) per weight class were used to visually compare \ncapture efficiency by method, family and species. \n\nOdds ratio meta-analysis was performed on capture data pooled by family using \n\nSTATSDIRECT\u00ae statistical package, for each of the following pairs of methods: 60L pitfall \n\nversus 30L pitfall; Sherman traps versus Tomahawk trap; live traps versus pitfalls. For \neach comparison, only families captured in both methods under comparison were included \n\nin the analysis. We excluded from this analysis the accidental captures of: 1) Hylidae, in \n\ncomparison among pitfalls, since these are not true captures individuals could easily \n\nescape from buckets; 2) Iguanidae, Polychrotidae and Scincidae, in comparison among \n\nlive traps and pitfalls since only one individual of each family was captured in live traps. \n\nEstimation of independent (family) and pooled odds-ratio weights the number of \n\npositive (capture) and negative cases (empty trap/pitfall), for both trap type. Thus, the \n\ncalculation accounted for differences in trap-night numbers between different traps. \n\nHeterogeneity among independent odds-ratios was estimated in the analysis, using the \n\ninconsistency index I2 (Higgins et al. 2003). A model accounting for random effects was \n\nchosen for estimating pooled odds-ratios (DerSimonian &amp; Laird 1986). Confidence \n\nintervals (95%) for the independent and pooled estimates were also calculated in the \n\nanalysis. \n\nOne-tailed t-test for unpaired samples was performed for statistical comparison \nbetween the average numbers of mammal recaptures, per night, in pitfalls, for: (1) one \n\nsampling period during dry season (9 nights, August 2007) and (2) total sampling time (84 \n\nnights). Our goal was to test the hypothesis that the average number of recaptures per \n\nnight was higher during that particular dry season. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.5 \u2013 Results \n\nDuring this study, 2286 individuals were captured: 1507 amphibians (five families), \n\n325 lizards (ten families) and 454 small mammals (three families). Total numbers of trap-\n\nnights (Table 2.1) were as follows: Sherman traps (8580 trap-nights); Tomahawk traps \n\n(3900); 30L pitfalls (6159) and 60L pitfalls (4079). Global capture rates were higher for \n\n30L (15.12%) and 60L pitfalls (22.16%) than for Sherman (3.62%) and Tomahawk traps \n\n(4.10%) (Table I). Capture rates for amphibians in 30L and 60L pitfalls were very high \n\ncompared with other vertebrate groups. Recaptures in pitfalls and live traps only occurred \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nCapturing Small Mammals and Herpetofauna \n\n35 \n \n\nfor mammals and teiid lizards. A negligible number of amphibian recaptures was observed \n\nin pipe traps and during active search.  \n\n \nTable 2.1 \u2013 Capture/recapture rates given by taxa and trap type, expressed as percentage of \n\ntrap-nights number.

Ameiva ameiva (Linnaeus, \n1758) was also frequently captured in Sherman traps. Tupinambis teguixin (Linnaeus, \n1758), the largest species of the family occurring in the area, was almost exclusively \ncaptured in Tomahawk traps. Larger didelphids were mainly captured in Tomahawk traps \n\nand, to a lesser extent, in Sherman traps and 60L pitfalls. Smaller didelphid species, such \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 2 \n\n40 \n \n\nas Marmosa murina (Linnaeus, 1758), were mainly captured in Sherman traps. Larger \ncricetids were captured more frequently in Sherman traps and 60L pitfalls. Smaller \n\ncricetids were mainly captured in pitfalls, particularly in the larger ones. Echimyids were \n\nalmost only captured in live traps. \n\nCaptures rates for amphibian taxa were consistently higher for 60L pitfalls, but \n\nboth pitfalls captured individuals within the same weight-range. Families Leiuperidae, \n\nLeptodactylidae and Microhylidae were the major contributors to the observed capture \n\nrates. One or two species per family \u2013 Pseudopaludicola mystacalis (Cope, 1887, \nLeiuperidae) and Physalaemus cuvieri (Fitzinger, 1826, Leuiperidae), Leptodactylus \nleptodactyloides (Andersson, 1945, Leptodactylidae) and Elachistocleis ovalis (Schneider, \n1799, Microhylidae), respectively \u2013 accounted for most of the captures, with a large \n\nproportion of juveniles in the latter three species. For lizard taxa, 30L and 60L also \n\ncaptured individuals within the same weight-range. \n\nHeterogeneity estimates for odds-ratio analysis, using the inconsistency index (I2) \n\nwere: 67.0%, 90.0% and 97.0%, respectively. Heterogeneity among independent \n\nestimates (families) was globally high. Therefore, we used a random model to estimate \n\nthe pooled odds-ratios. For overall comparisons (Figure 2.4), combined odds-ratio was \n\nonly significantly different from 1 in the pair 60L/30L pitfalls (1.50, 95% CI = 1.19 to 1.88), \n\nwhere we can state that capture odds in favour of 60L pitfalls were about one and a half \n\ntimes greater than in 30L pitfalls. \n\nIn familial comparisons between pitfalls of different size: Bufonidae (5.15, 95% CI \n\n= 1.82 to 17.87), Leiuperidae (1.43, 95% CI = 1.23, 1.66, Leptodactylidae (1.62, 95% CI = \n\n1.32 to 1.99), Microhylidae (1.65, 95% CI = 1.31 to 2.08) and Didelphidae capture odds \n\n(7.34, 95% CI = 2.99 to 21.65) were significantly greater in favour of 60L pitfalls. For the \n\npair Sherman/Tomahawk traps, capture odds were significantly greater for: Cricetidae \n\n(42.27, 95% CI = 7.39 to 1687.94), in favour of Sherman traps; and for Teiidae (0.50, 95% \n\nCI = 0.33 to 0.74), in favour of Tomahawk traps. For the pair live traps/pitfalls, capture \n\nodds were significantly greater for: Didelphidae (4.43, 95% CI = 3.09 to 6.54) and \n\nEchimyidae (16.33, 95% CI = 4.27 to 138.85), in favour of live traps; and for Teiidae (0.59, \n\n95% CI = 0.45 to 0.76), in favour of pitfall traps. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nCapturing Small Mammals and Herpetofauna \n\n41 \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.4 \u2013 Results from odds-ratio pairwise meta-analysis: 60L pitfall versus 30L pitfall (4a); \n\nSherman traps versus Tomahawk trap (4b); live-trap versus pitfall trap (4c).

Mean number of mammal recaptures per night, in pitfalls, during the peak of 2007 \n\ndry season (1.00 \u00b1 0.71, n = 9) was significantly greater (t = 3.919, df = 91, p &lt;0.0001) \nthan mean number of mammal recaptures per night, in pitfalls, during total sampling \n\nperiod (0.26 \u00b1 0.52, n = 84). \n\n \n\n \n\n2.6 \u2013 Discussion \n\n \n2.6.1 \u2013 Amphibians \n\nMost amphibians present a typical sit-and-wait foraging strategy, using mainly \n\nvisual cues for prey detection (Duellman &amp; Trueb 1994). Baited live traps were primarily \n\ndesigned for capturing small mammals, which forage actively, using olfactory cues. This \n\nbehavioural difference might be the reason for the absence of amphibian captures in live \n\ntraps, as occurred in this study. There is no reason to believe that sit-and-wait predators \n\nwould be more prone to fall inside pitfalls than to enter in live traps. However, animals \n\nmight be captured simply because they move at some extent. Drift-fences enlarge the \n\narea of influence of pitfalls, by driving individuals into the buckets, and thus there is a \n\nhigher probability of being intercepted by the drift-fences than by live traps. On the other \n\nhand, pitfalls allow multiple captures. \n\nSeveral amphibians present explosive breeding behaviour and tend to be \n\ngregarious in early stages of life (Wells 2007). This behaviour was already reported for \n\ngenus Elachistocleis, Leptodactylus and Physalaemus (Barreto &amp; Andrade 1995; \nRodrigues et al. 2003; Brasileiro et al. 2005), and is probably the reason for the observed \n\nhigh capture-rate for juveniles of some amphibian species. Despite the large capture \n\nrates, amphibians were never recaptured in pitfalls. Their low vagility (Blaustein et al. \n\n1994), associated to the fact that they were released at some distance from capture \n\nlocation, probably contributed to this result. \n\nAdditional methods substantially increased the number of captured species. \n\nSeveral were unique species from families Hylidae (5 species) and Leptodactylidae (3 \n\nspecies), and one species was the single representative of the family Craugastoridae, in \n\nthis study. Other authors had already suggested that the use of several methods is critical \n\nfor adequately sampling herpetofauna (Greenberg et al. 1994; Crosswhite et al. 1999; \n\nHutchens &amp; DePerno 2009). \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nCapturing Small Mammals and Herpetofauna \n\n43 \n \n\nDuring fieldwork, several individuals from smaller weight classes were observed \n\ntrying to climb pitfall walls. We suspect that even for smaller individuals, there is a chance \n\nof escape that is inversely proportional to the depth of the pitfall. Largest differences in \n\ncapture rates between different pitfalls were for individuals from the lower weight classes, \n\nbut also for medium-size leptodactylids. Leptodactylids are good jumpers and 30L pitfalls \n\nmay be too shallow to prevent the escape of adult individuals of medium to large species. \n\nBufonids, on the other hand, are not good jumpers, and even the larger ones were \n\ncaptured in both pitfalls. Larger pitfalls were more efficient than smaller ones for capturing \n\namphibians.  \n\n \n\n2.6.22 \u2013 Lizards \nLizards can be broadly classified as widely (or active) foragers or as sit-and-wait \n\n(or ambush) predators, according to foraging mode (Miles et al. 2007). Sit-and-wait \n\nbehaviour is frequently reported in families Polychrotidae, Tropiduridae (Iguania) and in \n\nNeotropical Gekkota (Gekkonidae, Sphaerodactylidae and Phyllodactylidae); while \n\nTeiidae, Gymnophtalmidae and Scincidae generally present active foraging behaviour \n\n(Colli et al. 2007; Vitt &amp; Zani 1998a, 1998b; Miles et al. 2007). Teiids are active foragers \n\nthat use mainly chemical signals for prey capture and discrimination (Cooper 2007), and it \n\nis likely that they were attracted to bait in live traps, like mammals. Capture rates, in live \n\ntraps, were similar for teiids and small mammals. Recapture rates were however \n\nsubstantially lower for teiids.  \n\nLive traps failed to capture any other lizard family efficiently. Several causes can \n\nbe suggested for this result. Iguania and Gekkota lizard families are mainly composed of \n\nambush predators, as already discussed. Amphisbaenids are highly specialized fossorial \n\nsquamates (Colli &amp; Zamboni 1999). Family Scincidae also includes several ambush \n\npredators, such as genus Mabuya (Brown &amp; Nagy 2007). The gymnophtalmid lizard \nMicrablepharus atticolus is an active predator, but specialized in ants (Rodrigues 1996), \nand is usually found near to ant and termite mounds. Live traps were significantly less \n\nefficient in capturing teiids, than pitfalls. Among live traps, Tomahwak traps appear to be \n\nthe most suitable for capturing teiids. However, as already mentioned, there is a strong \n\nbias from small species towards Sherman traps, and from larger species towards \n\nTomahawk traps. \n\nTeiids and gymnophtalmids were the most captured lizards, in pitfalls. Besides \n\nfeeding strategy, one probable cause is that they are more active on ground. The \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 2 \n\n44 \n \n\npolychrotid Anolis nitens (Wagler, 1930, Polychrotidae) was the third most captured lizard, \nand also spends much time in leaf-litter (Vitt et al. 2008a). All other species that occur in \n\nthe area have arboreal or fossorial habits (Vitt et al. 2008b). \n\n \n\n2.6.3 \u2013 Small mammals \nEndothermy demands a high energetic cost and mammals spend much of their \n\ntime searching for food (Townsend et al. 2008). This physiological constraint is probably \n\non of the reasons why live traps (baited) were globally more efficient for small mammals, \n\nthan pitfalls (non-baited). If capture rates are pooled for pitfalls and live traps, didelphids \n\nand echimyids were captured significantly more often in live traps. Only cricetids were \n\nmore frequently captured in pitfalls but this result was not significant. For this family, \n\ncapture rate in Sherman traps was much higher than in Tomahawk traps. One possible \n\nexplanation is that Tomahawk traps are not suitable for capturing cricetids, simply \n\nbecause most individuals do not have enough weight to trigger the trap. Alternatively, they \n\ncould be able to escape through the trap mesh, as already suggested by Lyra-Jorge &amp; \n\nPivello (2001). Our study supports this hypothesis in that only individuals from weight \n\nclass V were captured in Tomahawk traps but individuals from lower weight classes were \n\ncaptured both in Sherman traps and in pitfalls. Considering only Sherman traps, capture \n\nrate was almost twice the average rate for pitfalls. In general, recapture rates were also \n\nhigher for live traps than for pitfalls, except for recapture rate of echimyids in Tomahawk \n\ntraps, which was very low. \n\nThe overall number of small mammal species captured in pitfalls (14spp.) was \n\ngreater than in live traps (12spp). This finding is in agreement with those from previous \n\nauthors (Umetsu et al. 2006, Caceres et al. 2011). However, there were differences \n\nbetween the three mammal families. Pitfalls captured more species of cricetids, while live \n\ntraps captured more echimyids and didelphids. Additional methods used in this study were \n\nmostly ineffective for capturing small mammals but two arboreal species, which were \n\nrarely (Caluromys philander Linaeus, 1758) or never (Rhipidomys sp. nov., Rocha et al. in \npress) captured in live traps or pitfalls, were found dead in pipe traps. \n\nCapture odds for didelphids were significantly greater in favour of larger pitfalls. A \n\npossible explanation is that smaller pitfalls cannot prevent the escape of larger individuals, \n\nas already stated by several authors (Lyra-Jorge &amp; Pivello 2001; Hice &amp; Schmidly 2002; \n\nUmetsu 2006). Echimyids were rarely captured in pitfalls and only in the larger ones. \n\nCricetids were not captured in significantly higher rates in any type of pitfall, possibly \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nCapturing Small Mammals and Herpetofauna \n\n45 \n \n\nbecause both pitfalls were effective in preventing the escape of most of the captured \n\nindividuals. Sherman and Tomahawk traps appeared to be equally suitable for capturing \n\nechimyids. Sherman traps, which in this study were larger than standard ones (Slade et \n\nal. 1993), clearly did not capture larger individuals from family Didelphidae as efficiently as \n\nTomahawks. \n\n \n\n2.6.4 \u2013 Trap-habit behaviour in pitfalls \nRecapture rate for didelphids was higher than recapture rate for any other taxa, in \n\nlarger pitfalls. This recapture rate was in fact comparable to those from live traps. In this \n\nstudy, didelphids generally presented the highest capture and recapture rates, suggesting \n\nthe existence of trap-habit behaviour, which is frequently referred to in literature for live \n\ntraps (Sealander &amp; James 1958; Woodman et al. 1996; Umetsu et al. 2006). However, we \n\nfound no references in literature that related trap-habit behaviour to pitfalls. \n\nFrom 22 mammal recaptures in 60L pitfalls during the entire sampling, nine \n\noccurred in the sampling period of the 2007 dry season. Only three didelphids (two \n\nDidelphis marsupialis Linnaeus, 1758 and one Philander opossum Linnaeus, 1758) were \nrecaptured in the referred sampling period. We hypothesized that these captured \n\nindividuals were intentionally entering pitfalls. The number of recaptures during this period \n\nwas significantly greater than recapture number for total period. We consider that there is \n\nenough evidence for trap-habit behaviour, eventually caused by the availability of a limited \n\nresource, inside the pitfalls. During the dry season, water was frequently dropped into the \n\nbuckets. On the other hand, arthropods were frequently captured inside pitfalls. We \n\ncannot be sure if these individuals were being attracted by the water or by the arthropods. \n\nBoth species commonly include arthropods in their diet (Emmons &amp; Feer 1997). It is \n\npossible that, in response to the seasonal scarcity of fruits, seeds and arthropods in this \n\nregion (Vieira 2003), these individuals found a suitable source of food inside the pitfalls. \n\n \n\n2.6.5 \u2013 Final Considerations \nSpecies within a family share several common features (e.g. ecological, \n\nmorphological, behavioural), because of their shared ancestry. Based on our results, we \n\nsuggest that the foraging strategy of different taxa can influence the efficiency of a given \n\nmethod. Taxonomically distinct taxa that present similar foraging strategy tend to be \n\ncaptured by the same techniques. One example is the unexpectedly capture efficiency of \n\nlive traps revealed for teiids, despite the fact that these traps were primarily designed for \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 2 \n\n46 \n \n\nmammals. The same way, vagility and size of individuals could affect capture rates for \n\ndifferent methods. In this study, differences in size between two rodent families (Cricetidae \n\nand Echimyidae) or within the lizard family Teiidae reflected in significant differences in \n\ncapture efficiency of distinct methods. This variation within vertebrate taxa must be \n\nconsidered when designing sampling strategy, or diversity might be underestimated. \n\nAmbush predators, which include all anurans and most lizards in this study, were \n\ncaptured in pitfalls, but not in live traps. In addition, if pitfalls had not been used, eight \n\nspecies would not have been captured. This was the least selective method, capturing \n\nacross all vertebrate taxa. Despite the initial effort of putting up pitfall lines, we suggest \n\nthat these should be used together with other methods, particularly in short-term studies, \n\nwhen local biodiversity must be surveyed within a small period. \n\nAbout one third of the species found in this study were unique to active search or \n\npipe traps. These methods were not efficient for small mammals but, for herpetofauna, \n\nthey represented a substantial increase in species number. This result stresses the \n\nimportance of alternative methods, which are sometimes easier to implement and with \n\nlower cost (Hutchens &amp; DePerno 2009). Our results show that diversifying capture \n\nmethods increases the number of captured species, and thus species richness estimates, \n\ncorroborating the findings of previous authors, in other regions (Mengak &amp; Guyn 1987; \n\nGreenberg et al. 1994; Voss &amp; Emmons 1996; Crosswhite et al. 1999; Umetsu 2006). We \n\nexpect that our results and considerations will help researchers and other wildlife \n\nprofessionals to design sampling strategies that provide a more accurate picture of the \n\nstate of biodiversity, in a region of fast-evolving human impact. \n\n \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \nWe thank Mr. Ant\u00f3nio Messias, Roberto, Mr. Joaquim, Mr. Lucimar and all others who \n\nhelped with logistics and fieldwork.

Additionally, \n\nwe assessed the influence of pipe colour on the colonization success. We used fifty-\n\nfive sets of three refuges (white, grey and black). We registered 122 colonization \n\nevents by four Hylidae and one Scincidae species. Refuge colour did not significantly \n\naffect colonization success. Environmental data explained a significant portion (10.6%) \n\nof total variance of species data. The variables vegetal type and insertion height \n\npresented the highest correlation with species data. \n\n \nKeywords: Amazonia; Cerrado; colour; environmental variables; Hylidae; Scincidae \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2 \u2013 Introduction \n\nTree frogs are easily observed in breeding sites, during the mating season but, \n\ndue to their elusive behaviour, they are not easily detected outside these areas and \n\nperiods (Pittman et al., 2008). For this reason, the knowledge about their biology \n\noutside of breeding habitats is limited (Lemckert, 2004). This lack of knowledge is \n\ncritical, because terrestrial areas surrounding breeding habitats are crucial for the \n\nsurvival of amphibian populations (Marsh &amp; Trenham, 2000; Semlitsch &amp; Bodie, 2003). \n\nEven species with long reproductive season spend more time in terrestrial habitats \n\n(Wilbur, 1984). In the case of some Neotropical hylids, reproductive cycles are related \n\nto arboreal microhabitats such as tree holes and bromeliads (Haddad &amp; Sawaya, 2000; \n\nHaddad &amp; Prado, 2005). \n\nArtificial pipe refuges have been suggested as an alternative sampling \n\nmethodology for hylids (Boughton et al., 2000; Johnson, 2005; Myers et al., 2007). \n\nPipes can be installed on trees or in the ground, allowing its use in forest habitats and \n\nreproductive areas. This methodology was successfully used in ecological (Mahan &amp; \n\nJohnson, 2007; Liner et al, 2008; Pittman et al., 2008) and conservation studies \n\n(Schurbon &amp; Fauth, 2003; Wyatt and Forys, 2004). Colonization success of pipe \n\nrefuges can be influenced by: pipe diameter (Bartareau, 2004); placement of pipes \n\n(Myers et al., 2007); sex and size of tree frogs, and tree species (Johnson et al, 2008); \n\nand tree frog species (Hoffman et al (2009). The effect of refuge colour on the \n\n\n\n \n\n54 \n \n\ncolonization success of pipe refuges was never studied, but Crawford and Kurta (2000) \n\nfound that anurans were more efficiently captured in black pitfalls than in white ones. \n\nThese authors suggested that anurans might perceive light-coloured traps as different \n\nfrom the substrate and avoid them, or dark traps as potential refuge and enter them. \n\nWe hypothesize that colour might indirectly influence the colonization of artificial \n\nrefuges, in the same way, because of differences in luminosity between lighter (white) \n\nand darker (black and grey) refuges. \n\nDespite the high tree frog diversity in the Neotropics, pipe refuges are not \n\ncommonly used in this region, judging from the lack of published references to its use \n\n(but see: Laurencio &amp; Malone, 2009; Silva &amp; Rossa-Feres, 2007). Our aim was to \n\nassess the usefulness of pipe refuges for biodiversity surveys and ecological studies in \n\nNeotropical habitats by: surveying which tree frog species colonize the refuges; and \n\nassessing if correlations between environmental and species data can be obtained. We \n\nalso aimed to assess whether or not pipe colour influences colonization success. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3. \u2013 Methods \n\nThis study was conducted in two different areas at the ecotonal region between \n\nCerrado and Amazonia, in Brazil: one at the mid-Araguaia River, including Parque \n\nEstadual do Cant\u00e3o (PEC, east bank, state of Tocantins) and Fazenda Santa F\u00e9 (FSF, \n\nwestern bank, state of Par\u00e1); the other at Fazenda Lago Verde (FLV, state of \n\nTocantins). PEC is a 90,000 ha state conservation unit mainly composed by seasonally \n\nflooded forests. FSF is a 65,000ha private ranch with 65% of its area covered by well-\n\npreserved semi-deciduous tropical forest. FLV is an 8,000ha private ranch with 70% of \n\nthe area constituted by pristine Cerrado physiognomies. Natural forest fragments \n\n(ipucas) occur within the agricultural and Cerrado matrices. \nThree sampling points were placed in PEC, two in FSF and three in FLV. We \n\nused 55 sets of three arboreal pipe refuges (one of each colour: white, grey and black). \n\nFive sets of pipes were installed in each sampling point in PEC and FSF, and ten in \n\neach sampling point in FLV. Pipes were installed at two heights: above head and waist \n\nlevel. Pipe refuges were adapted from Johnson (2005): length \u2013 40cm; inner diameter \n\n\u2013 4cm; maximum water level \u2013 8cm. \n\nEach area was sampled during three periods of seven days each: end of rain \n\nseason (April to May 2008), dry season (June to September 2008) and beginning of \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nCapturing Small Mammals and Herpetofauna \n\n55 \n \n\nrain season (October to November 2008). Refuges were visited every two days during \n\nthe sampling periods, totalizing twelve visits per sampling point. Arboreal pipe refuges \nwere only removed at the end of the study. Captured individuals were individually \n\nmarked with visible implant elastomer and released about 30m away from capture \n\nlocation. The first three individuals of each species were collected as voucher \n\nspecimens and deposited at Cole\u00e7\u00e3o Herpetol\u00f3gica da Universidade de Bras\u00edlia \n\n(CHUNB). The snout-vent length (SVL) of all individuals was measured prior to \n\ncollection or releasing.  \n\nFor each arboreal pipe refuge, the following environmental variables were \n\nmeasured: height of opening; perimeter of insertion branch; perimeter of widest branch \n\non insertion tree/shrub; distance to widest branch; number of branches; angle of \n\ninsertion; percentage of canopy cover; vegetal type (tree or shrub) and bark rugosity \n\n[from smooth (0) to very rugose (3)]. Damages to pipe refuges were classified \n\naccording to its intensity: no damages (0), and minor (1), moderate (2) or severe \n\ndamages (3). Refuges were repaired or replaced whenever needed. \n\nIndividuals were always released relatively far from capture location, thus \n\nrecaptures were considered independent colonization events and included in the \n\nanalysis. We estimated the mean, minimum and maximum SVL of each captured \n\nspecies. We searched for significant differences in average number of captures and \n\ndamage intensity among differently coloured refuges. Numbers of captured individuals \n\nper species were considered insufficient for independent statistical comparisons. Thus, \nstatistical analysis was performed based on the total number of captured individuals. \n\nOur data did not conform the assumptions of homocedasticity and normality of \n\ndistribution. Therefore, multiple comparisons were made using Kruskall-Wallis test. \n\nPairwise comparisons were performed using Dwass-Steel-Chritchlow-Fligner test. Both \n\ntests were performed using STATSDIRECT\u00ae, considering a 0.05 significance level. \n\nRedundancy analysis (RDA) was performed using CANOCO\u00ae for Windows\u00ae, to search \n\nfor correlation between environmental and species data. Sampling point and refuge \n\ncolour were included as covariates in RDA. The null hypothesis of independence \n\nbetween species and environmental data sets was tested using a Monte Carlo test, \n\nwith 1000 permutations. The significance test (p=0.05) was run for the first canonical \naxis and for all axes together. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n56 \n \n\n3.4 \u2013 Results \n\nWe registered 114 colonization events by hylids (4 recaptures) and eight by the \n\nskink Mabuya frenata. A maximum of three individuals of Trachycephalus venulosus \nwere found simultaneously colonizing the same pipe. Average SVL for captured \n\nspecies (Table 3.1) varied from 16.7 \u00b1 1.71 mm (Scinax fuscomarginatus), to 53.2 \u00b1 \n16.24 mm (Osteocephalus taurinus). The smallest individual colonizing the pipes was a \nS. fuscomarginatus (SVL = 14.2 mm), and the largest was an O. taurinus (SVL = 74.5 \nmm). We found no significant effect of colour on the average number of individuals per \n\nrefuge (white, 0.84 \u00b1 1.014; gray, 0.54 \u00b1 0.741; black, 0.84 \u00b1 1.102), for simultaneous \n\ncomparison of all samples (groups = 3; df = 2, total observations = 165; T = 2.2403; p = \n0.326). Several refuges were damaged during the study and sometimes were found \n\nlying at the base of insertion trees. Simultaneous comparison of all samples (groups = \n\n3; df = 2, total observations = 165; T = 14.5037; p = 0.001) revealed a significant effect \nof colour on the average damage level of the arboreal refuges (white, 0.58 \u00b1 0.956; \n\ngray, 0.11 \u00b1 0.369; black, 0.13 \u00b1 0.388). \n\n \nTable 3.1 \u2014Mean and SD, minimum and maximum snout-vent length (SVL) and number of \n\ncolonizing individuals in arboreal refuges, given per species and refuge colour. \n\nSnout-vent length (mm)  Refuge colour \nSpecies N \n\nMean \u00b1 SD Min-max  White Grey Black \n\nHylidae        \n\nOsteocephalus taurinus 5 53.2 \u00b1 16.24 37.7\u201374.5  2 3 0 \nScinax fuscumarginatus 39 16.7 \u00b1 1.71 14.2\u201320.4  14 13 12 \nScinax gr. ruber 39 30.6 \u00b1 4.82 22.4\u201342.5  21 2 16 \nTrachycephalus venulosus 31 50.5 \u00b1 7.49 37.0\u201369.3  8 10 13 \n\nScincidae        \n\nMabuya frenata 8 58.8 \u00b1 6.14 52.0\u201364.0  1 2 5 \nTotals 122    46 30 46 \n\n \n\nPairwise comparisons (critical q = 3.3145; df = 162) revealed that average damage \nlevel in white refuges was significantly greater than in grey (p = 0.004) and black (p = \n0.010) refuges, whereas there was no significant difference (p = 0.948) between the \nlatter two. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nCapturing Small Mammals and Herpetofauna \n\n57 \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 3.1 \u2013 RDA correlation biplot.

The portion of \n\nvariance explained by the first and by all canonical axes was significantly greater than \n\nexpected by chance alone (p = 0.003 and p=0.016, respectively). Vegetal type was the \nvariable most correlated with the first environmental axis (tree \u2013 0.380; and shrub \u2013 - \n\n0.550) and the first species axis (tree \u2013 0.178; and shrub \u2013 - 0.258). Insertion height \n\nwas the variable most correlated with the second environmental (0.752) and the \n\nsecond species (0.201) axes. Relatively to the vegetal type, the score of the class \n\n\u201ctree\u201d was higher than for class \u201cshrub\u201d, for both Scinax species, and the inverse \noccurred for T. venulosus and O. taurinus. The latter two species presented strong \npositive correlation with the variable insertion height, while S. fuscomarginatus \npresented strong negative correlation and Scinax gr. ruber and M. frenata were not \ncorrelated with this variable. \n\n\n\n \n\n58 \n \n\n3.5 \u2013 Discussion \n\nOur results confirm the colonization of artificial arboreal refuges by four hylid \n\nspecies. A pilot survey, performed by us, revealed that four other \u2013 Dendropsophus \nminutus, D. nanus, D. rubicundulus and Hypsiboas raniceps \u2013 were able to colonize \npipes placed around ponds. The presence of other six species in the region \u2013 \n\nDendropsophus melanargyreus, Hypsiboas fasciatus, H. punctatus, H. albopunctatus, \nPhyllomedusa azurea and Scinax nebulosus \u2013 is documented by the voucher \nspecimens (CHUNB44914\u201346212) collected by Guarino Colli and collaborators and \n\ndeposited at Colec\u00e7\u00e3o Herpetol\u00f3gica da Universidade de Bras\u00edlia. Hylid species that \n\ncolonized the arboreal refuges are typical of forested or border areas (e.g. O. taurinus) \nand/or disturbed areas (e.g. S. gr. ruber) (Lutz, 1973; Lima et al., 2006). Species from \ngenus Trachycephalus, including T. venulosus, are frequently found in hollow metal \ntubes containing water (Lutz 1973). All other species, that were found in ground pipes \n\nin the pilot study, or that did not colonized the arboreal pipes at all, are more frequent in \n\nopen areas (Lutz 1973; Brasileiro et al. 2008). Some, like the small Dendropsophus \nspecies, are more frequently found in herbaceous vegetation at the margin of water \n\nbodies (Lutz 1973). Some of the smallest and largest species occurring in this region \n\ncolonized the refuges. Therefore, the size and diameter of pipes do not appear to have \n\nlimited the size of colonizing species. On the other hand, arboreal refuges were placed \n\nat the core or edge of forested patches and this might have restricted the range of \n\ncolonizing species. We believe that if arboreal pipes are placed in more open habitats \n\nmore species will be able to colonize the artificial refuges. On the other hand, if the \n\nobjective is to maximize the number of captured species, than placing the refuges near \n\nreproduction areas might be more efficient. \n\nThe skink Mabuya frenata also colonized the arboreal refuges. Colonization of \npipe refuges by lizards had already been reported by Johnson (2005). These findings \n\nsuggest that artificial refuges might also be useful for studying other groups of \n\nherpetofauna. \n\nOur results reveal that pipe refuges are more useful to survey Neotropical \n\nherpetofauna than suggested by previous studies (Silva &amp; Rossa-Feres 2007; \n\nLaurencio &amp; Malone, 2009), where none or only a few species and individuals \n\ncolonized pipe refuges. In the study by Laurencio &amp; Malone (2009), seven individuals \n\nfrom three species were captured in ground pipes, but none was captured in pipes \n\nplaced in the canopy. However, almost fifty percent of the species sampled in the area \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nCapturing Small Mammals and Herpetofauna \n\n59 \n \n\nwere not captured in the refuges, and none of the captured species was only captured \n\nin the refuges. These results indicate that artificial refuges might be less usefull for \n\nspecies surveys, than for ecological studies aiming arboreal species. \n\nOur results suggest that refuge colour did not affect colonization success, \n\ncontrarily to our initial hypothesis based on the findings of Crawford &amp; Kurta (2000). \n\nHowever, darker refuges were less prone to damage, and its use might be preferable \n\nbecause it would minimize the effort of fixing or substituting damaged refuges. \n\nDespite the small number of colonization events, it was possible to explain a \n\nsignificant portion of the total variance of species data. The two environmental \n\nvariables most correlated with species data were the height of insertion and the vegetal \n\ntype. Boughton et al (2000) also found evidence for the influence of height of insertion \n\non the colonization success by Hyla species. In their study, refuges placed higher in \ntrees were more efficient than those at ground level. In our study, colonization by T. \nvenulosus and O. taurinus was positively correlated with the insertion height, while \ncolonization by S. fuscomarginatus was negatively correlated with this variable. \nDifferences among species also occurred relatively to their frequency either on trees or \n\nshrubs. \n\nMore than helping to determine which factors influence colonization success, \n\nanalyzing the microhabitat characteristics of artificial refuges can help us to understand \n\nthe ecological preferences of hylids (Johnson &amp; Semlitsch, 2003; Pittman et al., 2008). \n\nConsidering the number of species and the ecological and reproductive diversity of tree \n\nfrogs in the Neotropics, we believe that pipe refuges might become an important \n\nmethodology in ecological studies in this region. \n\n \n\n \nAcknowledgements \n\nWe acknowledge the institutions: Parque Estadual do Cant\u00e3o, Fazendas Santa F\u00e9 e \n\n\u00c1guas do Papagaio, Fazenda Lago Verde, ECOTROPICAL (partnership between Universidade \n\nde Aveiro e Instituto Ecol\u00f3gica) and NATURATINS, for the logistic support.

Conservation units in the middle Araguaia present different levels of \n\nprotection and habitat heterogeneity. According to the theory of spatial heterogeneity, \n\nmore heterogeneous landscapes sustain greater diversity. Higher species richness are \n\nalso frequently associated with ecotones. In addition, the middle Araguaia basin has \n\nalso been suggested as a Pleistocene refuge for forest species. With the aim of \n\nclarifying these questions, we: (1) estimated anuran and lizard species richness in \n\nthree conservation units; (2) assessed the contribution of Amazonia and Cerrado \n\nherpetofaunas for the regional assemblages; (3) and compared our species richness \n\nestimates with estimates from other Amazonian and Cerrado localities. We compiled \n\ndata from two field campaigns performed between 2005 and 2008. Thirty-eight anuran, \n\n20 lizard, 26 snake and two amphisbaenian species were found in the study area. \n\nAnuran and lizard species richness was significantly larger in the more heterogeneous \n\nbuffer area, rather than in the strict conservation unit. Our results support the theory of \n\nspatial heterogeneity and previous findings that Cerrado lizard fauna is more diverse in \n\nthe interfluvial areas than in gallery forests. Our results did not corroborate the role of \n\nthe middle Araguaia basin as a refuge for forest species, nor the hypothesis that \n\ntransitional areas bear higher diversity than surrounding biomes. This study provides a \n\ngood example of the importance of environmental buffer areas, not only in reducing \n\nimpacts on other conservation units, but also in the effective conservation of the \n\nregional biota. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Amazonia; biodiversity; Cerrado; conservation status; herpetofauna. \n \n\n \n4.2 \u2013 Introduction \n\nThe Brazilian Cerrado is the only tropical savanna among the twenty-five \n\nbiodiversity hotspots proposed by Myers et al (2000), and Amazonian Rainforest is \n\nconsidered the largest and most diverse major tropical wilderness area (Mittermeier et \n\nal 1998). The Araguaia River runs between these two large and diverse biomes, and its \n\nbasin is considered a biodiversity hotspot for plants as well (Oliveira-Filho &amp; Ratter, \n\n2002). Moreover, the middle Araguaia river, Coco river (a tributary), and Bananal Island \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 4 \n\n66 \n \n\nwere also listed as priority areas for conservation within Cerrado (Cavalcanti &amp; Joly, \n\n2002). \n\nParque Nacional do Araguaia (PNA), in Bananal Island, was the first \n\nAmazonian park; originally comprising an area of 20,000 Km2, it was later reduced to a \n\nquarter of its original extent (Mittermeier et al, 2005). Recent conflicts between \n\nconservation authorities (ICMBio \u2013 Instituto Chico Mendes de Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nBiodiversidade) and indigenous people, motivated by the overlap between the park and \n\nthe indigenous lands at its southern border, remain unsolved (MPF-TO, 2010). The \n\nestablishment of Parque Estadual do Cant\u00e3o (PEC), in 1998 (Tocantins state law \n\nn\u00ba996, 14/07/1998), granted protection to a large area of alluvial forests in the \n\nconfluence of Araguaia and Coco Rivers. A large environmental buffer area, \u00c1rea de \n\nProte\u00e7\u00e3o Ambiental do Bananal/Cant\u00e3o (APABC), was created one year before \n\n(Tocantins state law n\u00ba907 from 20/05/1997) to limit the human impacts in PEC and \n\nPNA. A later attempt to reduce the buffer area to about one tenth of its original size, by \n\nthe state government of Tocantins, was stopped by the Federal Public Ministry (MPF-\n\nTO, 2005). \n\nIn addition to political and social tension regarding the establishment of \n\nconservation units, Amazonia and Cerrado biomes face other threats. Deforestation of \n\nCerrado has been faster and more intense than in Amazonia, and it is estimated that \n\n60% of this biome is now under direct human use (Klink &amp; Moreira, 2002). Despite \n\nbeing lower, deforestation rates in Amazonia are not uniform and become higher at the \n\nagricultural frontier, in the contact zone with Cerrado (Foley et al 2007), affecting 27% \n\nof the original extent of Xingu\u2019s area of endemism (Silva et al, 2005). One of the \n\nreasons of the asymmetry between these two biomes is that Brazilian law requires that \n\n80% of the forested area should be preserved in each holding in Amazonia, but this \n\npercentage is only 20% in Cerrado (Klink &amp; Machado, 2005). Only 2.2% of Cerrado\u2019s \n\noriginal extent is under any legal protection (Klink &amp; Machado, 2005). Fire (Fearnside \n\n2005; Hoffman &amp; Moreira 2002), habitat fragmentation (Carvalho et al 2009), and \n\nintroduction of African grasses (Klink &amp; Machado 2005, Pivello et al 1999) also \n\ncontribute actively to the degradation of these biomes, which in turn threatens the \n\npersistence of many vertebrate populations (Paglia &amp; Fonseca 2009). Cerrado \n\ndeforestation promotes the erosion and alteration of flowing pattern of the Araguaia \n\nriver basin (Latrubesse et al. 2009). Because of the fast pace of deforestation and \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nOn the Importance of Buffer Areas \n\n67 \n \n\nhabitat loss, the Amazonia/Cerrado frontier is considered a priority area for new studies \n\n(Azevedo-Ramos &amp; Gallati, 2002). \n\nContrary to the early recognition of high plant diversity in Cerrado, first works \n\nabout the Cerrado herpetofauna suggested low differentiation, low rate of endemism, \n\nand lack of distinctiveness (Duellman 1979; Vanzolini 1988; Silva &amp; Sites 1995). Colli et \n\nal. (2002) refuted these claims, stating that the horizontal habitat variability in Cerrado \n\nbalanced the vertical variability typical of forested habitats, resulting in similar levels of \n\nlocal species richness. Recent studies about the structure of Cerrado lizard fauna \n\n(Nogueira et al., 2005; Nogueira et al., 2009) revealed that it is mainly composed of \n\nhabitat specialists, with little faunal overlap between gallery forests and open \n\nformations. This pattern was also found for small mammals (Alho, 2005). The studies \n\nby Nogueira et al. (2005, 2009) also revealed that lizard richness in Cerrado was \n\ngreater in open formations than in gallery forests, revealing an opposite pattern to that \n\nobserved for birds (Silva, 1997; Silva and Bates 2002) and mammals (Redford &amp; \n\nFonseca, 1986). \n\nIn the last decade, several attempts were made, based on macro-scale \n\nanalyses, to identify patterns of diversity of squamates and anurans in Cerrado (Costa \n\net al 2007; Diniz-Filho et al 2004, 2007), and to predict a network of conservation areas \n\nthat maximizes the conservation of Cerrado anurans using the smallest possible area \n\n(Diniz-Filho et al 2004, 2006). In all these approaches, the middle Araguaia basin was \n\nestimated to have lower species richness than average. However, according to Bini et \n\nal. (2006), there is a generalized deficiency of sampling in the northern region of \n\nCerrado. According to these authors, the middle Araguaia region presents a high \n\npotential to harbor amphibian species yet to be described. Recent studies in the middle \n\nAraguaia basin revealed high species richness of birds (Pinheiro &amp; Dornas, 2009) and \n\nsmall mammals (Rocha et al, 2011), with the description of a new species, in the latter \n\ncase. \n\nThe conservation units from the middle Araguaia present different conservation \n\nstatuses and most importantly, different habitat characteristics. While PEC (strict \n\nconservation) is mostly composed of gallery and alluvial forests, highly subjected to \n\nseasonal flooding; APABC (buffer area) is more heterogeneous and less influenced by \n\nflooding regime, combining both closed, transitional and open formations. According to \n\nthe theory of spatial heterogeneity, the more heterogeneous and complex the physical \n\nenvironment becomes, the more complex and diverse the plant and animal \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 4 \n\n68 \n \n\ncommunities supported by that environment (Pianka et al, 1966, Richerson &amp; Lum, \n\n1980; Gu\u00e9gan et al, 2006). This greater diversity might be related to the presence of \n\nkeystone structures, essential to particular species or faunal groups (Tews et al., \n\n2004). One example comes from our study area, where the species Gymnodactylus \ncarvalhoi was found to be restricted to termite mounds (Vitt et al., 2006), which are \nfrequent in open Cerrado formations. Based on differences in habitat heterogeneity, we \n\npredict that APABC would present higher species diversity than PEC. \n\nThe Araguaia River basin was also proposed as a subspecies-endemicity \n\ncenter, highly correlated with the presence of paleoecological forest refuges for \n\nNeotropical forest butterflies (Brown 1982). Later, this region was also proposed as a \n\nrefuge for forest bird species during the climate fluctuations of the Quarternary (Silva, \n\n1997; Silva &amp; Bates, 2002). If the middle Araguaia River was a historical refuge for \n\nlizard and amphibian forest species, in the same manner as for butterfly and bird \n\nspecies, we would predict an higher proportion of species and endemics associated to \n\nforest habitats, and thus to the alluvial and gallery forests of PEC (Silva, 1995). In \n\naddition, ecotones are sometimes considered a source of higher species diversity and \n\nevolutionary novelty (Yahner, 1988; Risser, 1995; Smith et al., 1997). Therefore, \n\nbecause of the confluence of the Cerrado and Amazonian biome in this area, we would \n\nalso predict higher species richness than the average for Cerrado or Amazonian \n\nlocalities. \n\nIn order to clarify these issues, and using data collected by us and other \n\nworkers, we: (1) estimated the species richness of amphibians and lizards in each \n\nconservation unit; (2) assessed the contribution of Amazonia and Cerrado \n\nherpetofaunas in the regional species assemblage (3) compared estimates of anuran \n\nand squamate richness of this region with estimates for other Amazonian and Cerrado \n\nlocalities, and with estimates for the entire Cerrado biome, based on macro-scale \n\napproaches. The understanding of the partitioning of faunal richness across the \n\ndifferent conservation units in the middle Araguaia is important because of the different \n\nconservation statuses and also because of the recent attempts to reduce the size of \n\nAPABC. Increasingly more complete species lists for the whole region will also help to \n\nunderstand the contribution of Amazonian and Cerrado faunas to the regional \n\nherpetofaunal assemblages. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nOn the Importance of Buffer Areas \n\n69 \n \n\n4.3 \u2013 Methods \n\n \n4.3.1 \u2013 Study Area \n\nThis study was conducted in three different areas (Fig. 4.1): Parque Estadual do \n\nCant\u00e3o (PEC), a strictly protected area; \u00c1rea de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o Ambiental do \n\nBananal/Cant\u00e3o (APABC), a sustainable use protected area; and Fazenda Santa F\u00e9 \n\n(FSF), a private area. Climate in the region is tropical, with a rainy season from \n\nOctober to April and a dry season from May to September (INMET 2009). \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 \u2013 Map of the study area (right); its location within Brazil (top corner); and detail of \n\nsampling area (left), showing sampled locations (by any sampling methods) and major rivers. \n\nSampled locations depicted by black and white circles. Federal units: MT \u2013 Mato Grosso; PA \u2013 \n\nPar\u00e1; TO \u2013 Tocantins. Conservation areas: APABC \u2013 \u00c1rea de Protec\u00e7\u00e3o Ambiental da Ilha do \n\nBananal/Cant\u00e3o; FSF \u2013 Fazenda Santa F\u00e9; PEC \u2013 Parque Estadual do Cant\u00e3o. \n\nPEC is a state park with 90,000 ha, located within the municipality of Pium, in \n\nwest Tocantins state, at the border with Par\u00e1 state. It is a strict conservation unit \n\ncorresponding to World Conservation Unit (IUCN) category II (Rylands &amp; Brandon, \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 4 \n\n70 \n \n\n2005). The park is located in the alluvial basin of the Araguaia River and two of its \n\ntributaries (Coco and Java\u00e9s). It is bordered by the Araguaia River in the east, by the \n\nCoco River in the west, and by the Java\u00e9s River in the south. The park is primarily \n\ncovered by seasonally flooded alluvial forests, and to a lesser extent by non-flooded \n\nforests. PEC also includes some islands along the Araguaia River that can be more \n\nthan six kilometers long. \n\nAPABC is a 1,678,000 ha buffer area, at the eastern border of PEC, created to \n\nbuffer the impacts over PEC and PNA. This conservation area comprises nine \n\nmunicipalities from the state of Tocantins. Our work was developed within the area of \n\nthe three municipalities closer to PEC: Caseara, Marian\u00f3polis, and Pium. APABC is a \n\nsustainable use protected area, corresponding to IUCN category V (Rylands &amp; \n\nBrandon 2005). APABC presents greater habitat heterogeneity, including seasonally \n\nflooded and non-flooded grasslands with or without sparse trees, dry savannas, and \n\ndeciduous gallery forests across the waterways. Because human activities are allowed \n\nwithin APABC, there are also roads, pastures, croplands, settlements, and villages. \n\nThe buffer area is divided in zones for conservation, economical development, and \n\nspecial use. Because our interest was the area closer to PEC and the Araguaia River \n\nbasin, we did not sample across all the extent of this area, but focused on conservation \n\nzones bordering PEC, and Coco and Java\u00e9s rivers. \n\nFSF is a private ranch, with 65,000 ha, located in the municipality of Santana do \n\nAraguaia, state of Par\u00e1, at the western margin of Araguaia River. The main activity is \n\ncattle ranching, but about 65% of the ranch is still covered by deciduous forest. The \n\nforested area is concentrated near the margin of the Araguaia River, in the continuity of \n\nAPABC and PEC, following a longitudinal axis. These forests are drier than PEC and \n\nless influenced by seasonal flooding. \n\nConservation areas were not sampled throughout its entire extent. Therefore, \n\neffectively sampled areas were determined by the method of the convex hull, including \n\nall sampling points in each sampling area. The effectively sampled areas were as \n\nfollows: PEC \u2013 77,270 ha; APABC \u2013 87,304 ha; and FSF \u2013 1,090 ha. \n\n \n\n4.3.2 \u2013 Data collection \nField-data included in this study come from two different sources, separated by \n\na temporal gap of one and a half year. The first dataset was the result of a sampling \n\ncampaign performed by Guarino Colli and collaborators, during 2005. These authors \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nOn the Importance of Buffer Areas \n\n71 \n \n\nsampled amphibians and squamates continuously during 47 days, from September 5 to \n\nOctober 22. Sampling was done in the following habitats within PEC and APABC: \n\nalluvial forests, dry deciduous forests, savannas, and grasslands. Sampling methods \n\nincluded arrays of pitfalls with drift-fences, funnel-traps, and active search. All collected \n\nindividuals were deposited at Cole\u00e7\u00e3o Herpetol\u00f3gica da Universidade de Bras\u00edlia \n\n(CHUNB). Voucher specimens constitute a continuous series (CHUNB44914-46211) \n\nincluding 754 anurans and 532 squamates. Sampling date and geographical \n\ncoordinates are available for all collected individuals. \n\nThe second data set was the result of a sampling campaign done by E.F. and \n\nR.R., from June 2007 to November 2008, with a total number of 97 sampling days. This \n\nsampling included PEC, APABC, and FSF, widening the sampling area in the two first \n\nareas. We sampled amphibians and lizards in the several different habitats mentioned \n\nabove. No directed effort was made for capturing snakes, contrary to the 2005 \n\ncampaign. Different areas were sampled in the two years. Each area was sampled \n\nconsecutively during the end of the rainy season, dry season, and beginning of the \n\nrainy season, for equal periods. \n\nSampling methods included arrays of pitfall traps with drift-fences, Sherman and \n\nTomahawk traps, pipe-traps and active search. All methods were used in the three \n\nconservation areas at comparable proportions. However, sampling effort was greater in \n\nPEC and APABC than in FSF, and the number of captured individuals provides a fair \n\nidea of the differences of sampling effort across the three areas. Data on seven \n\nindividuals (four lizards and three snakes) found dead on road in APABC were also \n\nincluded. \n\nThe first captured individuals of each species, as well as individuals not \n\nidentified in the field, were collected. The remaining individuals were marked with \n\nvisible implant elastomer (VIE) and released. During this campaign, we captured 1844 \n\nanurans and 406 lizards, including 158 anuran and 72 lizard voucher specimens, \n\ndeposited at CHUNB (CHUNB58031\u201358260). All individuals were handled and/or killed \n\nethically. \n\nAll species considered in this study are documented by voucher specimen \n\n(CHUNB58103 \u2013 58260) or, when not possible, by tissue samples (CHUNB58036 \u2013 \n\n58208; 59185 \u2013 59239; 59580 \u2013 59613). This was the case of one Tupinambis \nmerianae and three T. quadrilineatus specimens, found dead on road, but not suitable \nfor collection as voucher specimens. Exception was made for three snake species \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 4 \n\n72 \n \n\n(Anilius scytale, Caudisona durissa and Boa constrictor), for which we have no voucher \nor tissue, but only photographic record. Nomenclature for species and families follows \n\nlists available at the Brazilian Herpetology Society site, for amphibians (SBH, 2011a) \n\nand reptiles (SBH, 2011b). \n\n \n\n4.3.3 \u2013 Data Analysis \nComparisons among the three areas were made using only amphibian and \n\nlizard taxa, because no special effort was made for capturing snakes or \n\namphisbaenians in the 2007-08 campaign. Including these taxa in the analysis would \n\nsurely constitute a source of bias. However, snakes and amphisbaenians were \n\nincluded in the total number of squamate species known from the middle Araguaia \n\nregion. \n\nThe two data sets were merged and individuals were pooled by area (PEC, \n\nAPABC and FSF). Only the first capture of each individual released during the 2007/08 \n\ncampaigns was included in this analysis. Information on the number of captured \n\nindividuals, microhabitat, conservation areas, and habitat characteristics of capture \n\nlocations was compiled for each species. Characteristics of capture locations (within an \n\naproximate 100m radius) were classified according to: (1) cover: closed (alluvial and \n\ngallery forests), mosaic (cerrado sensu strictu and cerrad\u00e3o), and open areas \n(grasslands and more open Cerrado formations); (2) flooding regime: seasonally \n\nflooded and non-flooded; (3) signs of anthropogenic disturbance: dirt roads, asphalt \n\nroads, and buildings; and (4) presence of permanent water bodies: rivers, lakes, and \n\nponds. For each species, habitat characteristic classes were only considered when the \n\nnumber of individuals captured in that given class was greater than 5% of total number \n\nof captured individuals of that species. Information about the typical biomes of \n\noccurrence (Amazonia or Cerrado) was collected from the literature (Table 1). \n\nInformation about sampling date and site of capture was available for all \n\nindividuals, and it was possible to sort them by chronological order of capture, for each \n\nof the conservation areas and for the total set of individuals captured in the region. \n\nAmphibians and lizards were then divided in groups of 40 and 20 individuals, \n\nrespectively, and subsequent analyses were preformed based on the chronologically \n\narranged groups of individuals. Individual-based rarefaction curves (sensu Gotelli and \nColwell, 2001), or Coleman curves, were generated separately for anurans and lizards, \n\nusing the software EstimateS 8.2.0 for Mac (Colwell, 2006).

Buzas and Gibson\u2019s E eveness index \n\n(Buzas and Gibson\u2019s, 1969), was estimated according to Hayek &amp; Buzas (1997) using \n\nthe following equation: \n\n \n\n! \n\nE =\ne\n\nH\n\nS\n \n\n \n\nwhere H is the Shannon\u2019s information index and S is observed species richness, \nestimated for each point of the rarefaction curves: \n\n \n\n \n4.4 \u2013 Results \n\nConsidering the two data sets, 3539 individuals were captured in the study \n\narea: 2598 anurans, 857 lizards, 81 snakes, and 3 amphisbaenians. Anurans were \n\nrepresented by seven families and 38 species, and lizards by nine families and 20 \n\nspecies (Table 4.1). Snakes comprised seven families and 25 species, and \n\namphisbaenians one family and two species (Table 4.2). Among anurans, 22 species \n\noccur in Cerrado, three in Amazonia and nine in both biomes. Among lizards, 12 occur \n\nin Cerrado, one in Amazonia and seven in both biomes. Ten anuran species and ten \n\nlizard species only occurred in habitats not subjected to seasonal floods. On the other \n\nhand, no lizard species and only five anurans were only found in or near seasonally \n\nflooded habitats. Relatively to vegetation cover, five lizards, but no anuran species, \n\nwere found only in closed forest formations. On the other hand, 15 anuran and six \n\nlizards were only found in open or mosaic formations. A higher number of anuran \n\nspecies was found most frequently on open/mosaic formations (26) than in close \n\nformations (12). However, roughly the same number of lizard species was found more \n\nfrequently in open/mosaic formations (9) and in closed formations (11). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 4 \n\n74 \n \n\nTable 4.1 \u2013 Captured anuran and lizard species (and number of individuals) and conservation units where they occurred.

On the other hand, for \n\nlizards, standard deviation (ACE) and confidence intervals remain broad even after \n\nadding all the individuals.

As previously mentioned, APABC is a more \n\nheterogeneous area, that includes several open and mosaic Cerrado formations, \n\nbesides the gallery and alluvial forests that dominate PEC. Most anuran species found \n\nin the study area were only or mostly found in open areas (both non-flooded and \n\nseasonally flooded) and mosaic cerrado formations. In this regard, lizard species were \n\nmore evenly distributed between closed and open habitats. However, because APABC \n\nincluded all habitats, species richness was still higher there. These results are in \n\nagreement with the findings of Nogueira et al. (2005, 2009), in that lizard fauna from \n\nCerrado was more diverse in the interfluvial areas than in gallery forests, contrarily to \n\nearlier findings for bird and mammal assemblages (Redford &amp; Fonseca, 1986; Silva, \n\n1997; Silva and Bates 2002). \n\nThe higher herpetofauna species richness found in the more heterogeneous \n\nAPABC corroborates the theory of spatial heterogeneity (Pianka, 1966). The diversity \n\nof habitats in this area, in opposition to the dominance of alluvial and gallery forests in \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nOn the Importance of Buffer Areas \n\n81 \n \n\nPEC, must have contributed to the higher species richness in APABC. The abundance \n\nof key structures (Tews et al., 2004) in the latter area, such as termite mounds, \n\nenabled the presence of specialist species like Gymnodactylus carvalhoi (Vitt et al., \n2006). Other species, like Amphisbaena cf. meringoera and M. maximiliani, were also \nonly or most frequently found in termite mounds, in APABC. \n\nRecent studies with medium and large mammals also reported higher species \n\nrichness in non-flooded areas (Haugaseen &amp; Peres, 2007; Negr\u00f5es et al., 2011), which \n\nsuggests that flooding regime, which is stronger in PEC, could also be limiting species \n\nrichness inside the park. Differences in species richness between PEC and APABC \n\nwere higher in the case of amphibians. Curiously, the five species restricted to flooded \n\nareas occurred in APABC but not in PEC. On the other hand, from the 19 species \n\nrestricted to APABC, 12 occurred in flooded areas or present aquatic microhabitat. In \n\nthe case of lizards, five species are restricted to APABC and to non-flooded habitats. \n\nHowever, all five species are typical of Cerrado biome and characteristic of more open \n\nformations. We therefore conclude that spatial heterogeneity must play a more \n\nimportant role in the partitioning of the herpetofauna assemblage, than flooding regime. \n\nNo support was found for the role of the middle Araguaia basin as a refuge for \n\nforest lizard or amphibian species. This theory was proposed by Silva (1997) for birds. \n\nIn the case of herpetofauna, only five species were confined to forested areas, and 23 \n\nspecies were more frequent in forested areas. On the other hand, 21 species were \n\nrestricted to the mosaic and open formations and 35 species were more frequent there. \n\nSpecies richness was also much lower in the alluvial and gallery forests of PEC, where \n\nonly 18 anuran and 12 lizard species were found, against 38 anuran and 19 lizard \n\nspecies in APABC. If the Araguaia basin had been a refuge for forest species, we \n\nwould expect a higher proportion of species in the gallery and alluvial forests of PEC. \n\nAlso, it would be expected that endemic species associated with forest areas would be \n\npresent. According to Silva (1997), in putative pleistocene refuges for forest species, \n\nwe would predict the existence of recently formed endemic species associated with \n\nforest habitats. Two lizard (Tupinambis quadrileneatus and Micrablepharus atticolus) \nand four anuran species (Elachistocleis ovalis, Leptodactylus martinezi, L. syphax and \nRhinella ocellata) found in the study area are endemic of Cerrado (Colli et al., 2002; \nBastos, 2007). From these species, only M. aticollus was more frequent in forest \nhabitat, but also occurred in more open formations. We therefore conclude that, \n\nbecause higher proportions of species richness and endemism are related to more \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 4 \n\n82 \n \n\nopen formations, it is unlikely that this region has been a refuge for forest anuran and \n\nlizard species during the Pleistocene.  \n \n\n4.5.2 \u2013 Species richness in the middle Araguaia: Amazonia and Cerrado contributions \nMost of the species (22 anurans and 12 lizards) found in this study, in the \n\nmiddle Araguaia basin, are strictly associated with the Cerrado biome. Only one lizard \n\n(Anolis ortonii), and three anurans (Leptodactylus leptodactyloides, Osteocephalus \ntaurinus and Pipa pipa) are strictly associated with the Amazonian biome. One of this \nspecies, A. ortonii, was only found once, in FSF, at the western border of the Araguaia \nRiver. Despite the much larger sampling effort in APABC and PEC, this species was \n\nnot found on the eastern bank of the Araguaia River. Eventually, a larger sampling \n\neffort in FSF might reveal the presence of more Amazonian species on the western \n\nbank of the river. The presence of more species in FSF is suggested by the mean \n\nvalues and dispersion measures of the estimates of species richness obtained with \n\nboth estimators (ACE and Chao1), which are above the observed species richness. \n\nSpecies richness estimates for the middle Araguaia River were within the range \n\nof the values estimated for other Amazonian and Cerrado localities. Anuran richness \n\nestimates for the middle Araguaia River (38) were within the values reported for \n\nCerrado localities (Vitt et al., 2002 \u2013 24 spp.; Bastos, 2007 \u2013 27-43 spp.) but lower than \n\nthe values reported for Amazonian localities (Lima et al., 2006 \u2013 50spp.; Bastos, 2007 \n\n\u2013 39-125 spp.; Bernarde, 2007 \u2013 47spp.). Lizard richness estimates for this area (21) \n\nwere also within the range of values reported for Cerrado (Colli et al., 2002 \u2013 14-25 \n\nspp.; Vitt et al., 2002 \u2013 18spp.; Nogueira et al., 2005 \u2013 17spp.; Nogueira et al., 2009 \u2013 \n\n13-28 spp.) and Amazonian localities (Colli et al., 2002 \u2013 16-30 spp.; Vitt et al., 2008 \u2013 \n\n32 spp.). \n\nThese results suggest that the ecotonal confluence between Amazonia and \n\nCerrado, in this region, is not characterized by an increase in species richness, \n\nrelatively to the merging biomes. Thus, these findings do not corroborate the idea that \n\ntransitional areas bear greater diversity (Yahnen 1988; Risser, 1995). Instead, our \n\nresults agree with the results of recent macro-scale approaches, which estimate lower \n\nvalues of squamate species richness at the edges of the Cerrado biome (Costa et al., \n\n2007). However, more sampling is needed in the western margin of the Araguaia River \n\n(FSF), where more species characteristic of the Amazonian biome might still be found, \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nOn the Importance of Buffer Areas \n\n83 \n \n\nas suggested by the rarefaction curves and species richness estimators, as well as by \n\nthe presence of Anolis ortonii in the area. \nSpecies richness estimates based on macro-scale approaches are available \n\nboth for anurans and squamates. Based on available data sampled in several Cerrado \n\nlocalities, Diniz-Filho et al. (2006, 2007) extrapolated anuran species richness for the \n\nentire biome. These estimates predicted a maximum of 42 species for the region of the \n\nBananal Island, and of 32 species for region where PEC and APABC lie. Our results, \n\nbased on field data, confirmed the presence of at least 38 anuran species. The species \n\nrichness of this area exceeded by six species the previous estimates, which \n\ncorresponds to an increase of about 19% relatively to the 32 species previously \n\nestimated. Based on the asymptotic behavior of the rarefaction curves and on the \n\nspecies richness estimates for the total study area, the observed number of anuran \n\nspecies already matched the theoretical maximum to the area. On the other hand, we \n\ncould not assign three anuran taxa to the species level, which might suggest that, as \n\npredicted by Bini et al. (2006), there are still some species to be described in this \n\nregion. The number of endemic anuran species found in PEC and APABC reached (3 \n\nsp.) or even slightly exceeded (4 sp.) the one estimated by Diniz-Filho (2007), \n\ndepending on which species are considered to be Cerrado endemics (Colli et al., 2002; \n\nBastos, 2007). \n\nA recent study regarding squamate richness in Cerrado, the area of the middle \n\nAraguaia, including Bananal Island, PEC, and APABC estimated a maximum of 30 \n\nsquamate species (Costa et al 2007). If we count all lizard, snake, and amphisbaenian \n\nspecies known to occur in this area, the observed squamate richness reaches 48 \n\nspecies. However, contrary to the anuran assemblage, at least one new lizard species \n\nis predicted by both species richness estimators, and the upper bound of the 95% \n\nconfidence interval of Chao 1 estimate reaches 34 species. In fact, during the second \n\nfield campaign, new squamate species were still being recorded. Some of these \n\nspecies, such as Micrablepharus atticolus (small-size and habitat specialist) and \nAmphisbaena cf meringoera (small-size and fossorial) are more difficult to sample. \nHowever, large species such as Tupinambis quadrilineatus, T. merianae, Boa \nconstrictor and Amphisbaena alba were only recorded during the second half of the \nsecond campaign, found dead in a road within APABC. These results suggest that it is \n\npossible that more lizard species can still be recorded in the region and that, even after \n\nintense sampling, a complete species list might not yet be a reality. \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 4 \n\n84 \n \n\n4.5.3 \u2013 Conservation implications \nAs mentioned at the beginning of this manuscript, Cerrado and Amazonia \n\nbiomes face severe threats to their integrity (Azevedo-Ramos &amp; Galatti 2002; Klink &amp; \n\nMoreira 2002; Silva &amp; Rylands 2005; Fearnside 2005; Carvalho et al 2009). Agriculture \n\nand pastures have supplanted Cerrado and, most recently, the transitional areas \n\nbetween Cerrado and Amazonian forests (Sousa &amp; Reid 2005). Deforestation can have \n\na direct negative effect on major rivers (Latrubesse et al. 2009) and Brazilian \n\ngovernment has development projects for two of them, Araguaia and Xingu (Sousa &amp; \n\nReid 2005). A large effort has been made in Brazil for the establishment of protected \n\nareas (Rylands &amp; Brandon 2005), but still a very small part of both biomes is under \n\nlegal protection (Silva 2005; Klink &amp; Machado 2005). The long-term persistence of \n\nAmazonian and Cerrado biotas depends not only on strictly protected areas but also on \n\nsustainable use reserves (Peres 2004). Successful cases of integration of sustainable \n\nuse reserves and indigenous lands in large extents of pristine areas exist (Campos &amp; \n\nNepstad 2006). Efforts towards such an integration of conservation areas with different \n\nstatuses are being conducted for the middle Araguaia basin. However, the area is \n\nunder strong human pressure and tension frequently arises. During the writing of this \n\nmanuscript, 10% of the area of PNA burned, threatening once again the integrity of \n\nregional conservation areas. \n\nOur data suggest that a significant part of herpetofauna diversity of the middle \n\nAraguaia exists outside strictly protected areas (PEC) and that surrounding areas, such \n\nas buffer areas (APABC) and private reserves (FSF) play an important role in the \n\npreservation of the herpetofauna of this region. This study focused only on three \n\nconservation areas but, nevertheless, we consider that the data here presented \n\ncorroborate the importance of long-term collection of field data as the basis for efficient \n\nconservation strategies. Moreover, this is a good example of the major importance of \n\nenvironmental buffer areas, not only in reducing impacts on other conservation units, \n\nbut also in the effective conservation of the regional biota. \n \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \nWe thank Daniel O.

The oldest is the Riverine Barrier Hypothesis, postulated by \n\nAlfred Russel Wallace, in 1852. This hypothesis resulted from the observation that large \n\nrivers were very frequent in the region and they dissect the Amazonian Rainforest in \n\nfragments of variable size. Recently, several studies using amphibian species distribution \n\nor molecular data have contributed to corroborate or refute this hypothesis. However, \n\nnone of these studies focused on the clear-water rivers that flow from the Brazilian Shield \n\nand run towards the Amazonian biome. Here we tested the Riverine Barrier Hypothesis in \n\nthe Araguaia River, the largest basin draining the Cerrado biome. For this purpose, we \n\ncollected molecular data from three amphibian species (Elachistocleis ovalis, \nLeptodactylus latrans and Trachycephalus venulosus), using the gene coding for the \ncytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1). Our results do not support the Riverine Barrier \nHypothesis, since we did not found reciprocally monophyletic (or even paraphyletic) \n\nclades on both banks of the river. Rather, we found that haplotypes were shared between \n\nboth banks of the Araguaia River, for the three species. Elachistocleis ovalis presented \ngreater genetic diversity and structure than L. latrans and T. venulosus, and two strongly \ndivergent lineages were found for the former species. The geographic dispersal of these \n\ntwo clades could support the role of Araguaia as of a semi-permeable barrier. We found \n\nno correlation between genetic structure and colour pattern variation, which might suggest \n\nthe existence of two sympatric cryptic species. The existence of these two sympatric \n\nclades is discussed in the light of recent taxonomic changes within genus Elachistocleis. \nAdditionally, the existence of two colour morphs in T. venulosus, consistent with the \nzonata and bufonia patterns described by Lutz in 1973, is reported for individuals sharing \nthe same cox1 haplotype. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Amazonia; Cerrado; cytochrome oxidase subunit-1 gene; COI; Elachistocleis \novalis; Leptodactylus latrans; Riverine Barrier Hypothesis; Trachycephalus venulosus. \n\n \n \n\n5.2 \u2013 Introduction \nAmazonian biodiversity has been puzzling naturalists for centuries and several \n\nhypotheses were raised in order to identify the mechanisms that shaped this amazing \n\ndiversity (reviews by Haffer, 1997; Zeisset &amp; Beebee, 2008; Haffer, 2008; Antonelli et al., \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 5 \n\n94 \n \n\n2010). The first of these hypotheses was the \u201cRiverine Barrier Hypothesis\u201d, proposed in \n\n1852 by Alfred Russell Wallace (Colwell, 2000). The idea that rivers could have shaped \n\nAmazonian biodiversity resulted from the observation that: large rivers are common in the \n\nNeotropics, since the Pleistocene; and they dissect the tropical forest in fragments of \n\nvarious sizes and different species occur on opposite banks (Gascon et al., 1998). \n\nSupport for this theory came for example from the study by Ron (2000), using \n\ndistribution data of amphibians and other vertebrate groups in Neotropical lowlands. Funk \n\nand collaborators (2007) tested two biogeographic hypothesis using Engystomops \n(formerly Physalaemus) petersi, and their results provided some additional support for the \nRiverine Barrier Hypothesis. Noonan and Wray (2006) also suggested that phylogenetic \n\nrelationships within populations of Dendrobates ventrimaculatus in Napo region might be \nin agreement this hypothesis. Further support came from studies with amphibians in \n\nChagres River, in Central America (Lampert et al., 2003), and Yalong and Dadu Rivers, in \n\nChina (Li et al., 2009). However, evidence against the role of rivers as barriers to \n\namphibian species came from several studies performed in Amazonian rivers (Gascon et \n\nal., 1998; Lougheed et al., 1999; Gascon et al., 2000; Symula et al, 2003) and, curiously, \n\nalso in rivers Yalong and Dadu (Zhao et al., 2009). \n\nAccording to some authors (Haffer, 1997; Noonan and Wray, 2006; Zeisset &amp; \n\nBeebee, 2008; Antonelli et al., 2010), no single model can adequately explain Amazonian \n\ndiversity. In fact, whether or not rivers can act as barriers seems to depend both on the \n\nriver and on the species being study. The Riverine Barrier Hypothesis has been tested for \n\namphibians in several Amazonian rivers, but not for the older clear-water rivers that flow \n\nfrom the Brazilian Shield (Gascon et al, 2000). One of these rivers, Tapaj\u00f3s, was studied \n\nby Bates and collaborators (2004), which found evidence of river-mediated genetic \n\nstructure in populations of several bird species in Tapaj\u00f3s headwaters. \n\nHere we tested whether or not the Araguaia River, which borders the southeastern \n\nlimits of Amazonia, acts as a barrier to gene flow in amphibian species. The Araguaia \n\nRiver is the main fluvial system in Cerrado and, together with Tocantins River, constitutes \n\nthe fourth largest drainage basin of South America (Aquino et al., 2008; Latrubesse et al., \n\n2009). Despite draining mostly within the Cerrado biome, Araguaia borders Amazonian \n\nrainforest throughout most of its lower course. Therefore, we considered Araguaia to be a \n\nsuitable candidate for testing the Riverine Barrier Hypothesis. \n\nGenealogical data indicate that, in addition to historical biogeographical events, \n\nbehaviour and natural history of species can also impact phylogeographic patterns (Avise, \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nRiverine barriers and amphibians \n\n95 \n \n\n2009). Comparative phylogeographic studies enable the distinction between historical \n\nevents, which may have influenced whole communities, from ecological or demographic \n\nforces acting on single lineages or species (Carnaval, 2002; Crawford et al., 2007). For \n\nthis reason, we propose to test the Riverine Barrier Hypothesis using three amphibian \n\nspecies with wide distribution in the Neotropical region, and with different life-history and \n\necology: the microhylid Elachistocleis ovalis, the leptodactylid Leptodactylus latrans and \nthe hylid Trachycephalus venulosus. \n\nElachistocleis ovalis is a leaf-litter species, presenting the borrowing habits shared \nby many microhylid species (Wells, 2007). This species reproduces after heavy rains, \n\nduring the rain season in more seasonal areas such as Cerrado (Rodrigues et al., 2003; \n\nPrado et al, 2005; Bernarde, 2007), or throughout the whole year, in the less seasonal \n\ncentral Amazonia (Lima et al., 2006). Leptodactylus latrans is the current valid name for \nthe species formarly known as L. ocellatus (Lavilla et al., 2010a). This species is \nconsidered to be an early stage in the trend towards terrestrial habit observed in \n\nLeptodactylus (Heyer, 1969). This species is an explosive breeder that reproduces \noccasionally, during the dry season (Prado et al, 2005; Wells, 2007), placing the eggs in \n\nfoam-nests above water surface (Heyer, 1969). Trachycephalus venulosus is a canopy-\ndwelling species (Wells, 2007) that is able to glide for several meters in the horizontal \n\n(Duellman &amp; Trueb, 1994). This species is considered an explosive breeder, which \n\nreproduces after heavy rains (Prado et al., 2005; Rodrigues et al., 2005; Bernarde, 2007). \n\nWe expect to find greater genetic structure and diversity, and a stronger influence of \n\nAraguaia on this structure in the case of E. ovalis, rather than in the more vagile L. latrans \nand T. venulosus. \n\nBy analyzing the genetic structure of these three species around the mid-course of \n\nthe Araguaia River, we hope to understand if this river constitutes a barrier to gene flow \n\nacross different groups of amphibians, at a local scale. In the end, we aim to understand if \n\nour results help to corroborate or refute the Riverine Barrier Hypothesis of the \n\ndiversification of Amazonian fauna. \n\n \n\n5.3 \u2013 Methods \n\n \n\n5.3.1 \u2013 Study area \nThis study was conducted in the region of the mid-Araguaia River, in an area \n\ncomprising four different conservation units (Figure 5.1), with different conservation \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 5 \n\n96 \n \n\nstatuses: Parque Estadual do Cant\u00e3o (PEC); \u00c1rea de Protec\u00e7\u00e3o Ambiental do \n\nBananal/Cant\u00e3o (APABC); Fazenda Santa F\u00e9 (FSF) and Fazenda Lago Verde (FLV). The \n\nregional climate is tropical and markedly seasnal, with a rain season from October to April \n\nand a dry season from May to September (INMET 2010). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 5.1 \u2013 Study area in the mid-Araguaia River basin.

It is a strict conservation unit corresponding to World \n\nConservation Unit (IUCN) category II (Rylands &amp; Brandon, 2005). The park is located in \n\nthe alluvial basin of the Araguaia River and two of its tributaries, Coco and Java\u00e9s. The \n\npark is mostly composed of seasonally flooded alluvial forests, and non-flooded forests at \n\na lesser extent. PEC also includes some islands along the Araguaia River that can be \n\nmore than six kilometres long. APABC is a 1,700,000ha buffer area, at the eastern border \n\nof PEC, created to buffer the impacts over PEC and Parque Nacional do Araguaia (PNA), \n\nat the south. APABC is a sustainable use protected area, corresponding to IUCN category \n\nV (Rylands &amp; Brandon 2005). FSF is a private ranch with 65,000ha, located in the \n\nmunicipality of Santana do Araguaia, state of Par\u00e1, at the western margin of Araguaia \n\nRiver. The main activity is cattle ranching but about 65% of the ranch is still covered by \n\ndeciduous forest. The forested area is concentrated near the margin of the Araguaia \n\nRiver, in the continuity of APABC and PEC. These forests are drier than PEC and less \n\ninfluenced by seasonal flooding. FLV is an 8,000ha private ranch managed for irrigated \n\ncrop production (rice, maize, bean and soybean), with almost 70% of the area constituted \n\nby pristine Cerrado sensu lato physiognomies. Natural forest fragments, locally named \n\nipucas, occur within agricultural and Cerrado matrices. \n \n\n5.3.2 \u2013 Sample collection \nSampling was carried out between June 2007 and November 2008, using pitfalls, \n\nPVC pipetraps and active search. Detailed descriptions of sampling strategy can be found \n\nin Ferreira et al. (submitted, Chapter II and III of this thesis). The first individuals of each \n\nspecies were collected, prepared as voucher specimens and are deposited at \u201cCole\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nHerpetol\u00f3gica da Universidade de Bras\u00edlia\u201d (CHUNB). All other individuals were \n\nindividually marked with visible implant elastomer (VE) and released. Blood samples were \n\ncollected directly from adult individuals into FTA\u00ae cards (Whatman\u2122). Blood was \n\ncollected after punching the forearm with a small lancet. Individuals were kept under \n\nobservation and released in the following morning. We observed no mortality resulting \n\nfrom blood collection procedure. Occasionally, tissue was collected from the thigh muscle \n\nof individuals found dead inside pitfalls, but that were no longer suitable for voucher \n\npreparation. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 5 \n\n98 \n \n\n5.3.3 \u2013 Laboratory protocols \nDNA was extracted from tissue samples preserved in FTA cards or ethanol using \n\nthe salt-extraction method (Bruford et al. 1992) and the concentration of DNA isolates was \n\nquantified using spectophotometer (model NanoDrop\u00ae ND-1000 UV/Vis, Thermo Fisher \n\nScientific). A 663-bp fragment of the gene coding for the subunit I of the cytochrome \n\noxidade (cox1) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the primers dgLCO1490 \nand dgHCO2198 (Meyers, 2003). Amplification reactions were performed using the \n\nfollowing PCR profile: initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 1 min; 37 cycles with denaturation at \n\n95 \u00b0C for 40 s, annealing at 48 \u00b0C for 40 s and polymerization at 72\u00b0C for 60 s; final \n\nextension at 72\u00b0C for 5 min. In order to amplify particular samples, small adjustments to \n\nthis profile were sometimes needed. PCR reactions were performed in a 25\u00b5l total \n\nvolume, using 1.0 unit of Taq-polymerase and final concentration of 0.12 \u00b5M of each \n\nprimer and 0.25\u00b5g/\u00b5l of bovine serum albumin. Other reagents were added according to \n\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions. Quantity of DNA template was aimed at 50-100ng, but \n\nsuccessful amplification occurred with as little as 10ng. The 663-bp fragment was \n\nsequenced once for each primer, in an automated sequencer ABI 310 using the Big Dye \n\nTerminator Cycle Polymerase (Perkin Elmer, Applied BiosystemsTM, Foster City, \n\nCalifornia). \n\n \n\n5.3.4 \u2013 Data Analysis \nSequences1 were aligned using CLUSTALW algorithm implemented in MEGA \n\nversion 4.1 (Kumar et al. 2008), and then checked and edited by eye. Alignments were \n\nperformed on the consensus sequences generated for each individual, using the raw \n\nsequences from forward and reverse sequencing. \n\nNumbers of haplotypes, haplotype (h) and nucleotide (?) diversity indices were \n\nestimated for each species, using DNASP version 5.10.01 (Librado &amp; Rozas, 2009) ), \n\nusing the alignments of all sequences from the Araguaia basin. Lists of haplotypes were \n\ngenerated with the same software and subsequent analyses were conducted based in \n\nhaplotypes rather than in individual sequences. To investigate whether or not river \n\nAraguaia acts as a barrier to gene flow in these three amphibian species, we generated \n\nphylogenetic trees using both distance-based and criterion-based algorithms, as well as \n\nhaplotype median-joining networks. For each species, the same taxa were used as \n\n                                                             \n1 The sequences generated during this study were not yet submitted to GenBank, but will be \nsubmitted prior to manuscript submission. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nRiverine barriers and amphibians \n\n99 \n \n\noutgroups (Table 5.1) in all analyses except MJ networks, which were calculated without \n\noutgroups. \n\nNeighbour-joining (NJ) trees (Saitou &amp; Nei, 1987) were inferred based on the \n\ngenetic distances estimated by the Kimura 2-parameter model (Kimura, 1980), using \n\nMEGA software. Bootstrap-consensus tree was inferred based on 1000 replicates \n\n(Felsestein, 1985). \n\nMost-parsimonious (MP) trees were inferred using PAUP* 4.0b10 (Swofford 1998) \n\nby heuristic search. Starting trees were generated by stepwise addition (Farris, 1970), \n\nusing 1000 replicates and a tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch-swapping algorithm \n\n(Swofford and Sullivan, 2009). Bootstrap 50% majority-rule consensus-tree was inferred \n\nbased on 500 replicates. \n\nBayesian inference (BI) of phylogenetic relationships among haplotypes was \n\nconducted using MrBayes version 3.1.2 (Ronquist and Hueselbeck, 2003). Prior best \n\nmodel of nucleotide substitution was chosen based on the scores of Akaike information \n\ncriteria, estimated using MrModelTest version 2.3 (Nylander, 2004). The settings for the \n\nchosen model, generated by MrModelTest, were then incorporated into MrBayes\u2019 input \n\nfile. Settings for the Metropolis coupling behavior were kept at default values. Markov \n\nchains ran for 1 million generations and were sampled each 100th generation. We \n\nconfirmed that chains had reach stationarity by inspecting the value of the standard \n\ndeviation of split frequencies. A 50% majority-rule consensus tree was generated after \n\ndiscarding 25% of the simulated generations as burn-in. NJ, MP and BI phylogenetic trees \nwere visualized and edited using FigTree version 1.3.1 (Rambaut, 2009). \n\nMedian-joining networks (MJ) were generated using the software NETWORK \n\n(Bandelt et al, 1999). Only polymorphic nucleotide sites were included in MJ analyses. \n\nGeographical location of haplotypes across the mid-Araguaia basin was superimposed to \n\nthe MJ networks a posteriori, following the grayscale and hatched patterns from figure 1, \nfor better visualization of geographical distribution of haplotypes. \n\nAverage pairwise genetic divergence between and within groups of haplotypes \n\nwas estimated using the Kimura 2-parameter method (Kimura, 1980) implemented in \n\nMEGA. Standard error estimates were obtained by bootstrap procedure (1000 replicates). \n\nConfidence intervals (95% CI) of the average pairwise distances were estimated \n\naccording to Hayek &amp; Buzas (1997). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 5 \n\n100 \n \n\n5.4 \u2013 Results \n\nWe obtained DNA sequences corresponding to fragments (663bp) of the cox1 \ngene from 72 Elachistocleis ovalis, 52 Leptodactylus latrans and 39 Trachycephalus \nvenulosus individuals. Additional sequences were included in the phylogenetic analysis: \nElachistocleis ovalis from Panam\u00e1 \u2013 KRL1136 and KRL1137, with the following GenBank \naccession numbers: FJ766754 and FJ766753; Trachycephalus venulosus from the \nAtlantic Forest, Esp\u00edrito Santo, Brazil \u2013 JFT473, JFT757, JFT955, provided by Jo\u00e3o F. \n\nTonini. Sequences for outgroup taxa were generated in this study or downloaded from \n\nGenbank (Table 5.1). \n\n \nTable 5.1 \u2013 Outgroup taxa used in the phylogenetic analyses (Genbank accession numbers).  \n\nSpecies Outgroup taxa \n\nElachistocleis ovalis Nelsonophryne aterrima (FJ766759) \u2013 Microhylidae \n Chiasmocleis shudikarensis (EF396044) \u2013 Microhylidae \n\nLeptodactylus latrans Leptodactylus fuscus (E0272, this study) \u2013 Leptodactylidae \n L. labyrinthycus (E0731, this study) \u2013 Leptodactylidae \n\nTrachycephalus venulosus Hemiphractus fasciatus (FJ766707) \u2013 Hylidae \n Hypsiboas raniceps (E0641, this study) \u2013 Hylidae \n\n \n\nThe alignment was unambiguous and the inferred sequence contained no stop codons. \n\nThe estimated best prior evolution models for Bayesian inference were: GTR (Rodriguez \n\net al. 1990) with gamma-distributed substitution rates for E. ovalis and T. venulosus; and \nHKY (Hasegawa et al, 1985) with gamma-distributed substitution rates for L. latrans. \nNumbers of haplotypes, and polymorphic and parsimony informative sites were higher  in  \n\nE. ovalis, and lower in T. venulosus (Table 5.2). The latter also presented the lowest \nlevels of haplotype and nucleotide diversity. Elachistocleis ovalis presented the highest \nnucleotide diversity but haplotype diversity was slightly lower than in L. latrans. \n\nAccording to the results of phylogenetic analysis, E. ovalis population presents  \ngenetic structure, but this structure appears not to be related with Araguaia River (Figure \n5.2). Two different clades (named EAraguaia and WAraguaia) were evident in the area of \n\nthe mid-Araguaia. Only the monophyly of WAraguaia was supported by BI, but both \n\nclades were supported by NJ and MP analysis, and were also evident in the MJ network. \n\nSamples from the western bank (FSF, state of Par\u00e1) were all clustered in only one of \n\nthese clades (WAraguaia), but they were not monophyletic or even paraphyletic relatively  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nRiverine barriers and amphibians \n\n101 \n \n\nTable 5.2 \u2013 Molecular diversity indices for cox1, for the sets of samples of the three amphibian \nspecies used in this study.

There was also haplotype sharing between the two banks of the Araguaia River, \n\nbut once again only in one clade (WAraguaia). According to the results of MJ analysis, a \n\nminimum of 14 mutations separated the ancestral haplotypes from both clades, which \n\nwere not sampled. The monophyly of the mid-Araguaia haplotypes relative to two \n\nhaplotypes collected in Panam\u00e1 was only supported by NJ analysis. The number of \n\nmutation steps separating these haplotypes (25) from the unsampled common ancestor of \n\nthe three clades was almost two times the number of mutation steps separating both mid-\n\nAraguaia clades (14). \n\nIn Elachistocleis ovalis, the estimated evolutionary divergence (Table 5.3) was \nlower between the clades from the river Araguaia (3.5%) than among these and the clade \n\nfrom Panama (5.9 and 7.0%). However, only the Western Araguaia clade was significantly \n\nmore divergent from the Panama clade. Indeed, the confidence intervals of the divergence \n\nestimate between both Araguaia clades overlapped with the confidence intervals of the \n\ndivergence estimate for the pair Panama/Eastern Araguaia. The average distances \n\nbetween clades were always higher than the average distances within clades, which \n\nvaried from 0.6% (WAraguaia and Panama clades) to 0.7% (EAraguaia clade). \n\nLeptodactylus latrans haplotypes presented no structure at all, in the region of the \nmid-Araguaia (Figure 5.3). Only external nodes received some support from NJ and MP \n\nphylogenetic analyses. BI only supported the monophyly of the ingroup relatively to other \n\nsympatric species of the same genus. Extensive polytomy was observed throughout the \n\nwhole tree, and only some external clades presented associated moderately high levels of \n\nposterior probability that were, however, not significant. These findings were posteriorly \n\ncorroborated by MP analysis, which retained three best trees (not shown) and also \n\npresented   extensive   polytomy.

Besides the support for the monophyly of the ingroup, three \n\nother clades were supported by MP and NJ analyses. One clade (Atl. Forest), also \n\nsupported by BI analysis, correspond to haplotypes sampled in the Atlantic forest, state of \n\nEsp\u00edrito Santo (Southeastern Brazil), which were monophyletic relatively to the mid-\n\nAraguaia haplotypes. However, the haplotypes from the mid-Araguaia were not \n\nreciprocally monophyletic relatively the Atlantic forest haplotypes. NJ and MP analyses \n\nsupported the monophyly of a clade that comprises the majority of the haplotypes from \n\nour study area (Araguaia I). The posterior probability (BI) associated with this clade was \n\nalso high, but not significant (<0.95). Another clade (Araguaia II), composed by two \n\nhaplotypes, was supported by NJ and MP analysis. However, the relationships among the \n\nthree clades and between these and the ungrouped haplotypes were inconclusive. MP \n\nanalysis retained ten best trees (not shown) and corroborated these results.  \n\nAverage pairwise divergence estimates for T.venulosus were lower than the \nestimates for E. ovalis, even for the divergence between the clades from River Araguaia \n(Table 5.4). One of the two clades from the River Araguaia appears to be genetically \n\ncloser to the Atlantic forest clade. However, for this species, divergence estimates among \n\nclades were not significantly different from each other. \n\n \nTable 5.4 \u2013 Average pairwise divergence estimates among T. venulosus clades (lower \ndiagonal) and 95% confidence intervals (upper diagonal), given as percentages. \n\n Atlantic Forest Araguaia I Araguaia II \n\nAtlantic Forest  \u00b11.0% \u00b10.8% \n\nAraguaia I 1.6%  \u00b10.8% \n\nAraguaia II 1.0% 1.6%  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nRiverine barriers and amphibians \n\n103 \n \n\n \nFigure 5.2 \u2013 Elachistocleis ovalis.

It also presents low amino acid divergence but \n\nhigh rates of nucleotide substitution and appears not to recover incorrect branches \n\n(Mueller et al, 2006). However, some disagreement exists regarding the overlap of \n\nintraspecific and interspecific variation in cox1 (Vences et al., 2005; Rubinoff et al., 2006; \nSmith et al., 2008). The fast evolution rate of the cox1 and its apparent reliability to \nrecover phylogenetic relationships were the reasons for choosing this genetic marker to \n\ntest the Araguaia River as a barrier to gene-flow at the intraspecific level of three \n\namphibian species. \n\n Haplotype diversity was high for the three species, considering estimates for other \n\namphibian taxa, using mtDNA genes (Lougheed et al, 1998; Vences et al., 2004; \n\nMakowsky et al., 2009; Zainudin et al, 2010).  Nucleotide diversity estimates obtained in \n\nthis study were located within the range of estimates for other amphibian species \n\n(Lougheed et al, 1998; Austin et al., 2002; Vences et al., 2004; Funk et al., 2007; \n\nMakowsky et al., 2009; Zainudin et al., 2010). However, nucleotide diversity was much \n\nhigher for E. ovalis than for the other two species. In the study on Pseudacris crucifer, by \nAustin and collaborators (2002), the highest levels of nucleotide diversity occurred in \n\nareas of secondary contact among two different lineages. In our study, E. ovalis was \nindeed the only species that appears to include two distinct lineages, supported by all \n\nanalyses except by bayesian inference. \n\n \n\n5.5.1 \u2013 Is Araguaia River a barrier to gene flow? \nThe general pattern revealed by phylogenetic trees and haplotype networks, \n\ngenerated for the three species studied here, shows no congruence between geography \n\nand genetic relationships. For all three species, several haplotypes (generally the most \n\nfrequent ones) occur on both banks of the Araguaia River. As expected, diversity was \n\nhigher in E. ovalis, even though haplotype diversity was slightly higher in L. latrans. In the \nlatter species, haplotypes were more evenly distributed and the ratio between \n\nhaplotypes/individuals (23/52) was higher than in E. ovalis (27/73). However, haplotypes \nin L. latrans were less divergent than in E. ovalis, which presented a greater proportion of \nparsimony informative sites and much higher nucleotide diversity. The level of structure \n\nwas also higher in E. ovalis. Two distinct clades were detected, with haplotypes from the \nwestern bank restricted to one clade, and haplotypes sampled at the northern portion of \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nRiverine barriers and amphibians \n\n107 \n \n\nthe eastern bank restricted to the other clade. But even for E. ovalis, it appears that \nAraguaia River does not constitute an effective barrier to gene flow, since haplotypes from \n\nthe two riverbanks are present, and even shared, in one of the clades. \n\nExpectations from the riverine barrier hypothesis include: 1) occurrence of two \n\nreciprocally monophyletic clades on opposite banks of the river (Haffer, 1997; Lougheed \n\net al., 1998; Patton et al., 2000; Funk et al, 2007); 2) occurrence of a paraphyletic clade \n\non one bank of the river, resulting from the dispersal of a population established on the \n\nother bank of the river (Haffer, 1997; Patton et al., 2000); 3) or strong genetic structure \n\nbetween populations on opposite banks of the river and little structure between \n\npopulations on the same bank (Gascon et al., 2000; Funk et al., 2007; Zhao et al, 2009). \n\nThe phylogeographic relationships revealed by our analysis do not corroborate any of \n\nthese expectations and thus, do not support the Riverine Barrier hypothesis. Our results \n\ncorroborate previous findings for Amazonian rivers (Gascon et al., 1998; Lougheed et al., \n\n1999; Gascon et al., 2000). All three species were captured near the river margins or even \n\nin the large islands that occur throughout the river. Frequently, haplotypes found in the \n\nislands also occurred in mainland, at one or both banks of the Araguaia River. \n\nPrevious authors hypothesized that gene-flow can occur when extensive portions \n\nof land are passively transferred from one bank to another in a river, each time a meander \n\nloop is cut off or a new river course is carved out within the floodplain (Haffer, 1997; \n\nGascon et al, 1998). In this study, all species were found in the islands. It is known that \n\nseparation and accretion of islands to the mainland occurs in the Araguaia, and that larger \n\nislands are stable in a decadal scale (Latrubesse, 2009). Therefore, we consider that \n\nthese islands can provide a mechanism of passive transfer of individuals from one bank of \n\nthe river to another. \n \n\n5.5.2 \u2013 Two lineages of E. ovalis in the Araguaia River \nOur results support two distinct lineages of E.ovalis in the region of the mid-\n\nAraguaia: one only at the eastern bank of the river and other mainly on the western bank. \n\nThese lineages presented high divergence (3.5%) and their monophyly relatively to \n\nhaplotypes of E. ovalis from Panama was not supported by MP and BI analyses. This \nresult might be related to the fact that, despite the Western Araguaia Clade being \n\nsignificantly more divergent from the Panama Clade than from the Eastern Araguaia \n\nClade, the magnitude of the divergence rates from the latter clade to the two former \n\nclades did not differ significantly. \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 5 \n\n108 \n \n\nThe taxonomy of genus Elachistocleis is still unresolved (Toledo et al., 2010), \ndespite recent attempts to clarify old controversies (Lavilla et al., 2003). Several species \n\nhave been recently described or revalidated (Elachistocleis skotogaster \u2013 Lavilla et al., \n2003; E. cesarii \u2013 Toledo et al., 2010; E. magnus \u2013 Toledo, 2010; E. surumu, E. \nmatogrosso, E. helianneae, E. carvalhoi and E. bumbameuboi \u2013 Caramaschi, 2010), \nadding to five previously known species. Species in this genus are mainly diagnosed by \n\ntheir colour patterns and the presence of postcommisural glands (Lavilla et al., 2003). In \n\nthe description of E.ovalis presented by Parker (1934), two colour varieties occur in \nElachistocleis ovalis, which ultimately might prove to be different species. \n\nThe individuals collected in the mid-Araguaia basin are in general agreement with \n\nthe description provided by Parker (1934) and presented great colour pattern variation \n\n(Supporting information \u2013 Figures 5.S1a to 5.S1c): presence/absence of discrete light \n\ndorsal strip; broad/thin femoral stripe, always with inguinal spots; more or less profusely \n\nspotted belly (sometimes not spotted at all). We did not found any correlation among \n\ncoloration patterns or between these patterns and the identified clades, or even \n\nhaplotypes. We could not safely assign the individuals from the Araguaia to any of the \n\nrecently described species, based on morphological characters. However, because the \n\nindividuals from this area fitted the description by Parker (1934), we considered that \n\nassigning them to E. ovalis would be a conservative approach. In addition, the specimens \nwe collected (CHUNB58168, CHUNB58177, CHUNB58165, CHUNB58180, \n\nCHUNB58185, CHUNB58150) were very similar to other specimens previously collected \n\nin the same area (CHUNB45831-45846), by Janalee Caldwell and collaborators, and \n\ndeposited as Elachistocleis ovalis in the Colec\u00e7\u00e3o Herpetol\u00f3gica da Universidade de \nBras\u00edlia. We do not exclude that ultimately they might be assigned to one of the recently \n\ndescribed Elachistocleis species, eventually when molecular data becomes available for \ncomparison. \n\nAccording to Bickford and co-authors (2006), morphological change might not be \n\ncorrelated with species boundaries because cryptic species are differentiated by nonvisual \n\nmating signals and/or could be under selection that promotes morphological stasis. \n\nAmphibians do tend to exhibit conservative morphological evolution and the application of \n\nmolecular and bioacustic tools are helping to reveal morphologically cryptic species \n\n(Bickford et al., 2006; Stuart, 2006). Many cryptic complexes are sympatric (Bickford et al, \n\n2006) but are not usually each other's closest relatives (Stuart, 2006). The existence of \n\ntwo considerably divergent lineages in the mid-Araguaia basin, that might not be each \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nRiverine barriers and amphibians \n\n109 \n \n\nother's sister group (not supported as sister clades by MP and BI analyses), suggests that \n\nthese two lineages might be part of a cryptic species complex. Unravelling cryptic species \n\ncomplexes is very important since actual biological species in those complexes have more \n\nlimited distributions than the complex itself, making each more prone to extinction (K\u00f6ller \n\net al., 2005; Bickford et al, 2006). \n\nThe average pairwise divergence rate between both Araguaia clades (3.5%) is \n\nabove the threshold for intraspecific variation (2%) and bellow the threshold for \n\ninterspecific variation (4%) estimated by Smith and collaborators (2008) for Holoarctic \n\namphibian species. Both average pairwise divergence rates between the Araguaia clades \n\nand the Panama clade are above the latter threshold (5.9% and 7.0%). However, taking \n\ninto account the values of intraspecific variation (mean 5.4%, regularly 10-14%) estimated \n\nby Vences and collaborators (2005) for Mantellid frogs, all the divergence rates estimated \n\nfor E. ovalis might be considered intraspecific variation. \nIf the variation that we encountered in the mid-Araguaia basin prove to be \n\nintraspecific, it might be possible that in fact the Araguaia River might pose some \n\nresistance to gene flow, acting as a semi-permeable barrier that reduces but does not \n\neliminate the probability of dispersal between geographic areas. Such kind of barrier (filter \n\nbarrier, in the sense of Remington, 1968) was found by Crawford and collaborators (2007) \n\nin the region of Bocas del Toro, Costa Rica. This way, two different lineages could have \n\nevolved at both banks of Araguaia River, with the posterior occurrence of dispersal across \n\nthe river, eventually by a mechanism of passive transfer mediated by the islands. \n \n\n5.5.3 \u2013 Considerations about the dorsal patterns in T. venulosus \nThe taxonomy of the genus Trachycephalus has also received recent \n\ncontributions. Faivovich et al., (2005) included genus Phrynoyas (and thus P. venulosa) \ninto genus Trachycephalus. Three new species were described recently: Trachycephalus \nlepida (Pombal et al, 2003), Trachycephalus dibernardoi (Kwet &amp; Sol\u00e9, 2008) in the \nAtlantic Forest, and Trachycephalus mambaiensis (Cintra et al., 2009) in Cerrado. All the \nspecies in the genus are easily distinguishable from T. venulosus. However, Lavilla et al. \n(2010b) suggested that this species might in fact constitute a species complex. In the \n\naccount by Lutz (1973), T. venulosus is described as presenting two distinct dorsal \npatterns: the uniform bufonia pattern, and the ornate zonata pattern, that vaguely \nresembles the dorsal pattern of Trachycephalus mesopheus, from the Atlantic Rainforest. \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 5 \n\n110 \n \n\nAccording to Lutz (1973), it was unlikely that both patterns were in fact two different \n\nspecies. \nThese two patterns occur in sympatry in the mid-Araguaia basin. Our results \n\nindicate no genetic structure relative to dorsal pattern (Supporting information, Figure \n\n5.S2). In fact, the same cox1 haplotype is shared by individuals presenting both patterns \n(eg. Figure 5.S2, TvenH8). These findings corroborate the hypothesis that both patterns \n\ncorrespond to the same species. Most of the haplotypes from the mid-Araguaia form a \n\nmonophyletic clade. However, the relationship between this clade with the other \n\nhaplotypes from this region and those from the Atlantic Forest (which also present the \n\nzonata pattern) is unresolved. In the case of T. venulosus, it also appears that several \ndifferent lineages occur in the Araguaia basin. However, in this case, the divergence rates \n\nare rather consistent with a scenario of intraspecific variation. \n\n \n\n \nAcknowledgments \n\nWe thank Carol Loss and Juliana Justino, who provided crucial help during the laboratorial \n\nwork.

Here, we propose to assess the genetic structure of three \n\nlizard species along the mid-Araguaia River, the largest drainage basin of the Cerrado \n\nbiome. These species, Anolis nitens brasiliensis, Ameiva ameiva and Tupinambis \nteguixin, differ in ecological requirements and size and we expect them to respond \ndifferently to the presence of Araguaia River. Ultimately, we aim to understand if the \n\ngenetic structure of these three species agrees with the predictions of the Riverine Barrier \n\nHypothesis. We collected tissue samples of these species along the mid-course of the \n\nAraguaia. We analyzed two fragments of mitochondrial DNA, corresponding to the genes \n\ncoding for the cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) and to the NADH dehydrogenase \nsubunit 4 (ND4). As expected, our results revealed a different scenario for each different \nspecies. T. teguixin revealed the lowest levels of diversity and genetic structure, followed \nby A. ameiva and A. n. brasiliensis. Haplotype sharing between the eastern and western \nbank occurred in T. teguixin and A. ameiva, but not in A. n. brasiliensis. For the latter \nspecies, haplotypes from the western bank formed a monophyletic clade that rendered the \n\neastern bank paraphyletic. These results suggest that Araguaia is not a barrier for both \n\nteiid species, but might constitute a barrier for gene flow in A. n. brasiliensis. We suggest \nthat these differences might be a result of the combined effect of habitat preferences, \n\necology and body size. Our results provide new information on how the genetic structure \n\nand diversity of sympatric but ecologically distinct species can respond differently to the \n\nsame environmental constraints. Phylogeograhic relations within Tupinambis were also \ndiscussed, by combining our data with previously published ones. The populations of T. \nteguixin from the mid-Araguaia and Roraima formed a monophyletic clade, but the \nmonophyly of T. teguixin (when including a population from Equador) relatively to T. \nquadrilineatus and T. longilineus was not supported by our analysis.  \n\n \n\nKeywords: Amazonia; Ameiva ameiva; Anolis nitens brasiliensis; Cerrado; Riverine \nBarrier Hypothesis; Tupinambis teguixin; \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 6 \n\n124 \n \n\n6.2 \u2013 Introduction \n\nThe role of rivers as barriers to animal populations and, thus, as one of the \n\nmechanisms responsible for the diversification of the Amazonian fauna, was first \n\nsuggested in a formal framework as the \u201cRiverine Barrier Hypothesis\u201d, in 1852, by Alfred \n\nRussell Wallace (Colwell, 2000). Some support for this hypothesis came from studies on \n\nthe distribution of Neotropical vertebrate taxa (Ron, 2000) and on the phylogenetic \n\nstructure of amphibians (Noonan and Wray, 2006; Funk et al, 2007), lizards (Pellegrino et \n\nal., 2005; Rodriguez-Robles et al., 2008), birds (Bates et al., 2004) and mamals (Patton et \n\nal, 2000; Rocha et al., 2011). However, the phylogenetic patterns revealed for several \n\nother species refuted the predictions of the Riverine Barrier Hypothesis. Evidence against \n\nthe dominant role of rivers in the diversification of Amazonian fauna came, sometimes, \n\nfrom the same studies (Patton el al, 2000; Noonan and Wray, 2006), but also from studies \n\nwith other species (Gascon et al., 1998; Lougheed et al., 1999; Gascon et al., 2000; \n\nSymula et al., 2003). Several authors agree that no single model could adequately explain \n\nAmazonian diversity, and that different mechanisms should be relevant in speciation \n\nprocesses of different faunal groups (Noonan and Wray, 2006; Zeisset and Beebee, 2008; \n\nHaffer, 2008; Antonelli et al., 2010). \n\nInsights about the role of rivers in the genetic structure of lizard species came from \n\na study by Glor and collaborators (2001), which found evidence of a very deep split \n\nbetween the subspecies of A. nitens at the north and at the south of the Amazon River. \nEvidence came also from studies in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest (Pellegrino et al., \n\n2005) and in the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico (Rodriguez-Robles et al., 2008). \n\nHowever, there are no published data, at least to our knowledge, on the genetic structure \n\nor phylogeography of lizard species along the several large rivers flowing from the \n\nBrazilian Shield. \n\nHere we propose to assess the potential role of one of these rivers, the Araguaia, \n\nas a barrier to the gene flow of lizard species. The Araguaia River is the main drainage \n\nbasin of the Cerrado biome and, together with the Tocantins River, constitutes the fourth \n\nlargest drainage basin of South America (Aquino et al., 2008; Latrubesse et al., 2009). \n\nThe Araguaia basin has been recognized as a priority area for conservation (Azevedo-\n\nRamos and Galatti, 2002; Cavalcanti and Joly, 2002). \n\nThe natural history of species can impact phylogeographic patterns (Avise, 2009), \n\nbut comparative phylogeography might help to discriminate community-level historical \n\nevents from ecological or demographic forces acting on single lineages or species \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nGenetic structure of three lizard populations \n\n125 \n \n\n(Carnaval, 2002; Crawford et al., 2007). For this reason, we chose to study three species \n\nthat diverge in their evolutionary history, ecology and size: Anolis nitens brasiliensis, \nAmeiva ameiva and Tupinambis teguixin. \n\nAnolis nitens is a polychrotid lizard with typical sit-and-wait predator behaviour \n(Colli et al., 1997; Vitt and Zani, 1998; Miles et al., 2007). This species is divided in \n\nseveral recognized subspecies, which were proven to be genetically divergent (\u00c1vila-\n\nPires, 1995; Glor et al., 2001). Anolis n. brasiliensis is widely distributed in the Cerrado \nbiome (Colli et al., 2002; Vitt et al., 2008a), occurring also periferically in Amazonia (\u00c1vila-\n\nPires, 1995), namely in the mid-Araguaia basin (Vitt et al., 2008a). Similarly to its \n\nAmazonian relatives (\u00c1vila-Pires, 1995; Vitt and Zani, 1998; Vitt et al, 2001; Vitt et al., \n\n2008b), this subspecies is a forest specialist, non-heliothermic, being predominantly found \n\nin the leaf litter and in the basal portion of trunks within forested habitats (Mesquita et al, \n\n2006; Vitt et al., 2008a). This species is very rarely observed in open areas (Colli et al., \n\n2002; Vitt et al., 2008a). \n\nThe teiids Ameiva ameiva and Tupinambis teguixin are ground-dwelling active \nforagers (Colli et al., 1997; Vitt and Zani, 1998; Miles et al., 2007). Both species are \n\nheliotherm (Vitt and Colli, 1994; Sartorius et al., 1999; Vitt et al, 2008b), and occur both on \n\nforested and open areas, preferentially in ecotones and naturally or antropogenically \n\ndisturbed areas such as tree-falls, clearings or river bluffs (Vitt and Colli, 1994; \u00c1vila-\n\nPires, 1995; Sartorius et al., 1999; Vitt et al. 2008a). At least T. teguixin is known to be a \ngood swimmer, despite its terrestrial habit (\u00c1vila-Pires, 1995; Vitt et al., 2008b). Ameiva \nameiva is a medium-sized lizard with a wide-distribution that extends from Panama to the \ntropical South America (Peters and Donoso-Barros, 1986), reaching the north of \n\nArgentina, east of the Andes (Colli, 1991). Tupinambis teguixin is a large lizard, distributed \nthroughout Amazonia and in the northern part of South-America east of Andes. Its \n\ndistribution limits are extended southwards, in gallery forests, to the state of S\u00e3o Paulo  \n\n(\u00c1vila-Pires, 1995). \n\nWith this study, we aim to assess the genetic structure of these ecologically \n\ndistinct lizards, in the region of the mid-Araguaia river. We wish to understand if and how \n\nthe Araguaia River interferes with the gene flow in these species and if, therefore, these \n\nfindings would provide evidence for or against the Riverine Barrier Hypothesis. We expect \n\nlevels of structure and diversity to be higher in the sit-and-wait predator and forest \n\nspecialist, A. n. brasiliensis, than in both the more active and less habitat-restricted teiid \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 6 \n\n126 \n \n\nspecies. At last, we expect that the much larger Tupinambis teguixin will reveal the lowest \nlevels of genetic structure and diversity. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.3 \u2013 Methods \n \n\n6.3.1 \u2013 Study area \nThis study was conducted in the region of the mid-Araguaia River, in an area \n\ncomprising four different conservation units (Figure 6.1), with different conservation \n\nstatuses: Parque Estadual do Cant\u00e3o (PEC); \u00c1rea de Protec\u00e7\u00e3o Ambiental do \n\nBananal/Cant\u00e3o (APABC); Fazenda Santa F\u00e9 (FSF) and Fazenda Lago Verde (FLV). The \n\nregional climate is tropical and markedly seasonal, with a rain season from October to \n\nApril and a dry season from May to September (INMET 2010). \n\nPEC is a state park with 90,000ha, in the west of the state of Tocantins, at the \n\nborder with the state of Par\u00e1. It is a strict conservation unit corresponding to World \n\nConservation Unit (IUCN) category II (Rylands &amp; Brandon, 2005). The park is located in \n\nthe alluvial basin of the Araguaia River and two of its tributaries, Coco and Java\u00e9s. The \n\npark is mostly composed of seasonally flooded alluvial forests, and non-flooded forests at \n\na lesser extent. PEC also includes some islands along the Araguaia River that can be \n\nmore than six kilometres long. APABC is a 1,700,000ha buffer area, at the eastern border \n\nof PEC, created to buffer the impacts over PEC and Parque Nacional do Araguaia (PNA), \n\nat the south. APABC is a sustainable use protected area, corresponding to IUCN category \n\nV (Rylands &amp; Brandon 2005). FSF is a private ranch with 65,000ha, located in the \n\nmunicipality of Santana do Araguaia, state of Par\u00e1, at the western bank of Araguaia River. \n\nThe main activity is cattle ranching but about 65% of the ranch is still covered by \n\ndeciduous forest. The forested area is concentrated near the Araguaia River, in the \n\ncontinuity of APABC and PEC. These forests are drier than PEC and less influenced by \n\nseasonal flooding. FLV is an 8,000ha private ranch managed for artificially irrigated crop \n\nproduction (rice, maize, bean and soybean), with almost 70% of the area constituted by \n\npristine Cerrado sensu lato physiognomies. Natural forest fragments, locally named \n\nipucas, occur within agricultural and Cerrado matrices. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nGenetic structure of three lizard populations \n\n127 \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6.1 \u2013 Study area in the mid-Araguaia River basin.

Detailed descriptions of sampling \n\nstrategy can be found in Ferreira et al. (submitted, Chapter II of this thesis) and Rocha et \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 6 \n\n128 \n \n\nal. (2011). The first individuals of each species were collected, prepared as voucher \n\nspecimens and are deposited at \u201cCole\u00e7\u00e3o Herpetol\u00f3gica da Universidade de Bras\u00edlia\u201d \n\n(CHUNB). All other individuals were individually marked with visible implant elastomer \n\n(VE) and released. Blood samples were collected directly from adult individuals into FTA\u00ae \n\ncards (Whatman\u2122). Blood was collected after punching between the lizard fingers with a \n\nsmall lancet. Individuals were kept under observation and released in the following \n\nmorning. We observed no mortality resulting from blood collection procedure. \n\nAlternatively, tail tissue samples were collected whenever lizards released the tail-tip, \n\nduring handling. Occasionally, tissue was collected from the thigh muscle of individuals \n\nfound dead inside pitfalls, but that were no longer suitable for voucher preparation. \n\n \n\n6.3.3 \u2013 Laboratory protocols \nDNA was extracted from tissue samples preserved in FTA cards or ethanol using \n\nthe salt-extraction method (Bruford et al. 1992) and the concentration of DNA isolates was \n\nquantified using spectophotometer (model NanoDrop\u00ae ND-1000 UV/Vis, Thermo Fisher \n\nScientific). A 663-bp fragment of the gene coding for the subunit I of the cytochrome \n\noxidade (cox1) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the primers dgLCO1490 \nand dgHCO2198 (Meyers, 2003). An initial 840 to 860-bp fragment of the gene coding for \n\nthe NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND4) was amplified using the primers ND4 and LEU \n(Ar\u00e9valo et al. 1994). \n\nPCR reactions were performed in a 25\u00b5l total volume, using 1.0 unit of Taq-\n\npolymerase and final concentration of 0.12\u00b5M (cox 1) or 0.16\u00b5M (ND4) of each primer and \n0.25\u00b5g/\u00b5l of bovine serum albumin. Other reagents were added according to \n\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions. Quantity of DNA template was aimed at 50-100ng, but \n\nsuccessful amplification occurred with as little as 10ng. \n\nAmplification of cox1 fragment was performed using the following PCR profile: \ninitial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 1 min; 37 cycles with denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 40 s, \n\nannealing at 48\u00b0C for 40 s and polymerization at 72\u00b0C for 60 s; final extension at 72\u00b0C for \n\n5 min. In order to amplify particular samples, small adjustments to this profile were \n\nsometimes needed. Amplification of ND4 fragment was performed using the following \nPCR profile: initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 5 min; 32 cycles with denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for \n\n30s, annealing at 54\u00b0C for 45s and polymerization at 72\u00b0C for 60 s; final extension at 72\u00b0C \n\nfor 5 min. The fragments were sequenced once for each primer, in an automated \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nGenetic structure of three lizard populations \n\n129 \n \n\nsequencer ABI 310 using the Big Dye Terminator Cycle Polymerase (Perkin Elmer, \n\nApplied BiosystemsTM, Foster City, California). \n\n \n\n6.3.4 \u2013 Data Analysis \nSequences2 were aligned using CLUSTALW algorithm implemented in MEGA \n\nversion 4.1 (Kumar et al. 2008), and then checked and edited by eye. Alignments were \n\nperformed on the consensus sequences generated for each individual, using the raw \n\nsequences from forward and reverse sequencing. \n\nNumbers of haplotypes, haplotype (h) and nucleotide (?) diversity indices were \n\nestimated for each species, for each gene in separate and for concatenated data, using \n\nDNASP version 5.10.01 (Librado &amp; Rozas, 2009), using the alignments of all sequences \n\nfrom the Araguaia basin. Lists of haplotypes were generated with the same software and \n\nsubsequent analyses were conducted based in haplotypes rather than in individual \n\nsequences. To investigate whether or not river Araguaia acts as a barrier to gene flow in \n\nthese three amphibian species, we generated phylogenetic trees using both distance-\n\nbased and criterion-based algorithms, as well as haplotype median-joining networks. For \n\neach species, the same taxa were used as outgroups (Table 6.1) in all analyses except \n\nMJ networks, which were calculated without outgroups. \n\nNeighbour-joining (NJ) trees (Saitou &amp; Nei, 1987) were inferred based on the \n\ngenetic distances estimated by the Kimura 2-parameter method (Kimura, 1980), using \n\nMEGA software. Bootstrap-consensus tree was inferred based on 1000 replicates \n\n(Felsestein, 1985). \n\nMost-parsimonious (MP) trees were inferred using PAUP* 4.0b10 (Swofford 1998) \n\nby heuristic search. Starting trees were generated by stepwise addition (Farris, 1970), \n\nusing 1000 replicates and a tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch-swapping algorithm \n\n(Swofford and Sullivan, 2009). Bootstrap 50% majority-rule consensus-tree was inferred \n\nbased on 500 replicates. \n\nBayesian inference (BI) of phylogenetic relationships among haplotypes was \n\nconducted using MrBayes version 3.1.2 (Ronquist and Hueselbeck, 2003). Prior best \n\nmodel of nucleotide substitution was chosen based on the scores of Akaike information \n\ncriteria, estimated using MrModelTest version 2.3 (Nylander, 2004). The settings for the \n\nchosen model, generated by MrModelTest, were then incorporated into MrBayes\u2019 input \n\n                                                             \n2 The sequences generated during this study were not yet submitted to GenBank, but will be \nsubmitted prior to manuscript submission. \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 6 \n\n130 \n \n\nfile. Settings for the Metropolis coupling behavior were kept at default values. Markov \n\nchains ran for 1 million generations and sampled each 100th generation. We confirmed \n\nthat chains had reach stationarity by inspecting the value of the standard deviation of split \n\nfrequencies. A 50% majority-rule consensus tree was generated after discarding 25% of \n\nthe simulated generations as burn-in. NJ, MP and BI phylogenetic trees were visualized \nand edited using FigTree version 1.3.1 (Rambaut, 2009). Phylogenetic analysis was \n\nconducted for each gene in separate and for the the concatenated data. \n\nMedian-joining networks (MJ) were generated using the software NETWORK \n\n(Bandelt et al, 1999). Only polymorphic nucleotide sites were included in MJ analyses. \n\nGeographical location of haplotypes across the mid-Araguaia basin was superimposed to \n\nthe MJ networks a posteriori, following the grayscale and hatched patterns from figure 1, \nfor better visualization of geographical distribution of haplotypes. \n\nAverage pairwise genetic divergence between groups of haplotypes was estimated \n\nusing the Kimura 2-parameter (K-2p) method (Kimura, 1980) implemented in MEGA. \n\nDivergence was estimated considering pairwise deletion of nucleotide sites and gamma \n\ndistributed evolutionary rates. Standard error estimates were obtained by bootstrap \n\nprocedure (1000 replicates). Confidence intervals (95% CI) of the average pairwise \n\ndistances were estimated according to Hayek &amp; Buzas (1997). \n\n \n\n \n\n6.4 \u2013 Results \n\nWe obtained DNA sequences corresponding to fragments (663bp) of the cox1 \ngene from 27 Anolis nitens brasiliensis and 69 Ameiva ameiva. Sequences from T. \nteguixin consistently presented too much ambiguity, despite the overall good quality of the \nsignal, and were discarded from the analyses. We also obtained DNA sequences \n\ncorresponding to fragments of the ND4 gene from 27 A. n. brasiliensis (860bp), 72 A. \nameiva (840bp) and 67 T. teguixin (840bp). Several stop codons and gaps were found in \nthe last portion of these sequences, which should correspond to the genes coding for a \n\nset of three t-RNA molecules (Ar\u00e9valo, 1994). We choose to eliminate this segment and \n\nonly the initial portion of the sequence (until the first stop codon) was used in the analysis. \n\nThis resulted in a ND4 fragment of 696-bp for A. n. brasiliensis, and 684-bp for A. ameiva \nand T. teguixin. For the latter species, additional sequences were included in the \nphylogenetic analysis (supporting information, Table 6.S1). Sequences used as outgroup \n\ntaxa were all generated in this study (Table 6.1). \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nGenetic structure of three lizard populations \n\n131 \n \n\nTable 6.1 \u2013 Outgroup taxa used in the phylogenetic analyses. \n\nSpecies Outgroup taxa \n\nAnolis nitens brasiliensis Anolis ortonii (E0353, this study) \u2013 Polychrotidae \n Polychrus acutirostris (E1115, this study) \u2013 Polychrotidae \n\nAmeiva ameiva Kentropyx calcarata (E0575, this study) \u2013 Teiidae \n Tupinambis quadrilineatus (E0746, this study) \u2013 Teiidae \n\nTupinambis teguixin Ameiva ameiva (E0586, this study) \u2013 Teiidae \n Kentropyx calcarata (E0575, this study) \u2013 Teiidae \n\n \n\nThe estimated best prior evolution model for Bayesian inference was the general \n\ntime reversible (GTR \u2013 Rodriguez et al. 1990), for all species/gene combinations. \n\nAdditionaly, shape parameter of gamma-distribution of substitution rates (GTR+G) was \n\nselected for: ND4 and for concatenate data, in A. ameiva and Tupinambis; and cox1 in A. \nn. brasiliensis. Proportion of invariable sites (GTR+I) was selected for: ND4 and \nconcatenated data in A. n. brasiliensis; and cox1 in A. ameiva. \n\nAnolis n. brasiliensis presented higher diversity in cox1 than in ND4, but the \nopposite occurred in A. ameiva (Table 6.2). Anolis n. brasiliensis presented the highest \nnucleotide diversity, in all cases. The values for this species were about two (ND4) to \nalmost five times higher (cox1) than in A. ameiva, and almost nine times higher (ND4) \nthan in T. teguixin. The number of cox1 haplotypes, in A. n. brasiliensis, was two times \ngreater than in A. ameiva. However, the number of haplotypes in A. ameiva was higher \nboth for ND4 gene and for concatenated data. All diversity indices were fairly lower in T. \nteguixin than in the other two species. \n\nGlobally, the results from phylogenetic analysis based on the two separated genes \n\nand on the concatenated data revealed very similar phylogenetic relationships. For this \n\nreason, only the results obtained from the concatenated data will be presented. When \n\nappropriate, disagreement among the results from the different data sets will be referred. \n\nAnolis nitens brasiliensis appears to be structured along the Araguia River, with no \nhaplotypes shared between riverbanks or among different areas in the eastern bank \n\n(Figure 6.2). However, few haplotypes were shared by more than one individual. \n\nMaximum parsimony and Neighbour-joining analyses supported the monophyly of the \n\nhaplotypes from the western bank. The Bayesian support was also high but not \n\nsignificant. These results were corroborated by the three methods in cox1 (0.98/97/97), \nbut received low support in ND4 (0.87/68/72). A deeper divergence appears to exist \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 6 \n\n132 \n \n\nbetween the haplotypes from the Araguaia basin and those from FLV. The monophyly of \n\nthe haplotypes from FLV received maximum support from all the analysis using the three \n\ndata sets. The monophyly of the Araguaia haplotypes was supported by MP and NJ \n\nanalyses, but not by BI. The exact same support values were obtained using all data sets. \n\nIn the MJ network, is possible to observe the very high number (106) of mutation that \n\nseparates the hypothetic common ancestor from FLV haplotypes (not sampled) from the \n\nclosest haplotype sampled in the Araguaia. The divergence estimate between the two \n\ndetected clades was 10.1% \u00b1 2.0%. \n\n \nTable 6.2 \u2014 Molecular diversity indices for cox1, nd4 and concatenated data, for the sets of \nsamples of the three lizard species used in this study: numbers of individual sequences (N), \npolymorphic sites/parsimony informative (Np) and haplotypes (H); Haplotype (h) and nucleotide (?) \n\ndiversity (\u00b1 SD). \n\n N Length Np/Pa H h ? \n\nA. nitens brasiliensis       \n\nCox 1 27 663 77/61 18 0.960\u00b10.021 0.01927\u00b10.00729 \n\nND4 27 696 71/60 15 0.932\u00b10.031 0.01686\u00b10.00648 \n\nConcatenated 27 1359 148/121 20 0.969\u00b10.021 0.01803\u00b10.00704 \n\nAmeiva ameiva       \n\nCox 1 69 663 27/23 9 0.543\u00b10.069 0.00404\u00b10.00126 \n\nND4 72 684 49/39 25 0.822\u00b10.027 0.00800\u00b10.00177 \n\nConcatenated 68 1347 75/60 28 0.924\u00b10.020 0.00537\u00b10.00145 \n\nTupinambis teguixin       \n\nND4 67 684 20/12 8 0.407\u00b10.071 0.00190\u00b10.00055 \n\n \n\nA different situation occurs in A. ameiva, where haplotypes are shared between \nriverbanks and among different areas from the eastern Araguaia bank (Figure 6.3). The \n\nmost frequent haplotype appears to be restricted to the eastern bank, but the second most \n\nfrequent one is shared by both banks and by the river islands. The NJ tree presents \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nGenetic structure of three lizard populations \n\n133 \n \n\nextensive politomy, with only one deep divergence between two clades: one (FLV) \n\ncomprising only haplotypes sampled in FLV and another (Araguaia) including all the \n\nhaplotypes from the Araguaia River and one haplotype found in FLV. The monophyly of \n\nthe clade FLV received high support in all analyses, except in BI (0.89) using the ND4 \ndata set. The monophyly of the Araguaia clade also received high bootstrap support from \n\nMP and NJ, but BI was only obtained in the case of cox1. The estimated divergence (K-\n2p) between the two clades was 3.3%\u00b11.0%. Haplotypes sampled in the mid-Araguaia \n\nbasin appear to radiate from a central and most frequent haplotype (AameH2), as \n\ndepicted in MJ network. Clade FLV does not connect to the network through this central \n\nhaplotype, but through a close one (AameH1), sampled at the southern area or PEC. The \n\nnumber of mutations (38) separating the haplotypes from clade FLV is several-fold larger \n\nthan the number of mutations separating any other two haplotypes in the MJ network. \n\nIn the case of T. teguixin the analysis was performed including sequences from \nthis and other species of the genus Tupinambis, used in previous studies (Supporting \nInformation, Table 6.S1), available at Genebank. Several of these sequences \n\ncorresponded to smaller fragments (375-bp) of the ND4 gene. In order to use as much \ndata as possible, analyses were performed using pairwise deletion of nucleotide sites \n\nwhen necessary. \n\nPhylogenetic analyses (Figure 6.4) confirmed the occurrence of three Tupinambis \nspecies in the study area: T. teguixin (TtegH1-H8), T. quadrilineatus (TquaH1) and T. \nmerianae (TmerH1). The original data set from Fitzgerald et al (1999) did not include \nT.quadrilineatus. Here, the monophyly of this species is highly supported by the three \nmethods, appearing as the sister species to T. longilineus. The monophyly of the \nhaplotypes of T. teguixin from the Araguaia is supported by MP and NJ analyses,but not \nby BI. This clade is presented as the sister clade to T. teguixin from Roraima, Brazil, with \nhigh support from MP and NJ analyses. The monophyly of the three T. teguixin \npopulations was only supported by MP analysis (83), but the monophyly of T. teguixin + T. \nlongilineus + T. quadrilineatus is highly supported by the three methods of phylogenetic \nanalysis. Divergence estimates (Table 6.3) were significantly lower than others involving \n\nthe same clades, in the following cases: T. teguixin from the Araguaia and from Roraima \n(5.8%\u00b12.5%); T. longilineus and T. quadrilineatus (6.6%\u00b12.7%); T. merianae and T. \nrufescens/T. duseni (11.1%\u00b13.7%). Tupinambis teguixin from Cuyabeno (Equador) was \nnot significantly more divergent from T. longilineus (14.6%\u00b14.7%) or T. quadrilineatus \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 6 \n\n134 \n \n\n(12.6%\u00b14.1%) than from the other two T. teguixin populations (Araguaia, 11.1%\u00b13.7%; \nRoraima, 10.4%\u00b13.9%). \n\n \nTable 6.3 \u2013 Average pairwise divergence estimates (K-2P) between Tupinambis clades. \nDivergence estimates are presented below diagonal and confidence intervals (95%) are presented \n\nabove the diagonal.

Fifty-\none individuals shared the same haplotype (TtegH1), which corresponded to more than \n\n75% of the sampled individuals. This haplotype occurred with high frequency in both \n\nbanks and in the Araguaia islands, suggesting lack of structure in the study area. The lack \n\nof structure is also patent in the NJ tree, where most of the nodes have no support from \n\nany of the analysis. All other haplotypes sampled more than once (TtegH2 and TtegH4) \n\noccurred in more than one area.  All haplotypes appear to radiate from the most abundant \n\none. One haplotype (TtegH2) is separated from the nearest one by 9 mutations, being \n\nsupported as sister to the remaining haplotypes by MP and NJ analyses. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n135 \n \n\n \nFigure 6.2 \u2013 Anolis nitens brasiliensis.

Besides these ecological differences, the three \n\nspecies also differ greatly in size, which was confirmed by the average size of individuals \n\ncaptured during this study (supporting information, Table S2). Average size for A. n. \nbrasiliensis reported here is slightly lower than in the study by Vitt and collaborators \n(2008a), for the same area. Our smaller sample size, and the inclusion of sub-adult \n\nindividuals in our case, was probably the main causes for this difference. Here, we chose \n\nto exclude all juveniles from the morphometric analysis but, because we did not evaluate \n\nthe reproductive condition, some non-reproductive individuals were certainly included. \n\nNevertheless, there is a large difference in size among the three species. Based on these \n\ndifferences, we would expect that A. n. brasiliensis presented a greater level of genetic \nstructure and diversity. \n\nThe lack of shared haplotypes between riverbanks and among different areas in A. \nn. brasiliensis, contrasting with the extensive haplotype sharing in both teiid species \nconfirms our suspects. The fact that all T. teguixin haplotypes sampled in more than one \nindividual were present in different geographic areas and the hegemony of a single and \n\nwidely dispersed haplotype also suggests an absence of structure in this species. On the \n\nother hand, the support for two distinct and, at some extent, geographically separate \n\nclades in Ameiva ameiva, as well as the existence of some geographic segregation of less \nfrequent (and not shared) haplotypes, indicates an higher level of structure in this species, \n\ncomparatively to T. teguixin. Nucleotide and haplotype diversity were always higher in A. \nn. brasiliensis than in A. ameiva and T. teguixin. In this regard, genetic diversity was also \nhigher in A. ameiva than in T. teguixin. As would be expected, there was a decreased \nlevel of structure and diversity with the increased vagility, which is a result of the \n\ncombined effects of feeding ecology, habitat preferences and body size. \n\nTwo strongly supported and widely divergent lineages were found in A. ameiva \nand A. n. brasiliensis, corresponding to a distinction between the haplotypes from the \nAraguaia and the haplotypes from FLV. These two areas are approximately 100 km apart, \n\nwhich is more than the 70 km that separate the northern and southern sampling locations \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nGenetic structure of three lizard populations \n\n139 \n \n\nalong the Araguaia. In the case of A. ameiva, haplotypes from both clades were sampled \n\nin FLV. Even though, the haplotype sampled in FLV that belongs to the Araguaia clade \n\n(AameH20) was not sampled along the Araguaia and was four mutations apart from the \n\nclosest sampled haplotypes (AameH2 and AameH27). This contrasted with the maximum \n\ndivergence of two mutations between any two closest haplotypes sampled in the \n\nAraguaia. Because of the very high divergence (K-2p = 3.3% \u00b1 1%; 38 mutations) \n\nbetween both clades, and because one of the clades was only composed by haplotypes \n\nsampled in FLV, we believe that the two clades correspond to distinct and long diverged \n\npopulations of A. ameiva and the presence of haplotype AameH20 in FLV is an evidence \n\nof recent migration from the Araguaia to Cerrado. FLV is located in an area dominated by \n\nCerrado sensu latu physiognomies, with remnants of forested patches dominated by plant \n\nspecies belonging to the families Favaceae, Arecaceae, Chrysobalanaceae and \n\nVochysiaceae (Martins et al. 2008). The mid-Araguaia basin is more densely vegetated, \n\ndominated by gallery and alluvial forests. Ameiva ameiva occurs both on forested and \nopen areas, preferentially in ecotones and naturally or antropogenically disturbed areas \n\nsuch as tree-falls, clearings or river bluffs (Vitt and Colli, 1994; \u00c1vila-Pires, 1995; Sartorius \n\net al., 1999; Vitt et al. 2008a). For this reason, we did not found evidence for the existence \n\nof barriers to the dispersal of this species that could justify the divergence here found. \n\nBecause individuals appear to be able to cross from one area to the other but clearly two \n\ndifferent lineages are present in this region, one might suspect that this area can actually \n\nbe a secondary contact area between two different lineages. We hypothesize that the \n\npopulation from the Araguaia might be closer related to Amazonian populations and the \n\nFLV to Cerrado populations. However, molecular samples from a broader area are \n\nneeded to confirm or refute this hypothesis. \n\nTwo very distinct lineages (10.1% \u00b1 2.0%) were also found in the case of Anolis \nnitens brasiliensis. We were not able to collect vouchers from the two specimens captured \nin FLV. Both specimens were caught in pitfalls and had been attacked and partially eaten \n\nby ants. The only reliable sources of information were the measurements taken and the \n\ntissue sample that was collected and deposited at CHUNB. We could suspect that the two \n\nindividuals belonged to another closely related species, Anolis meridionalis, which is \ntypical from Cerrado biome (Colli et al., 2002; Nogueira et al, 2005; Langstroth, 2006), \n\nbeing most commonly found in grasslands, but never in densely forested areas (Nogueira \n\net al., 2009). \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 6 \n\n140 \n \n\nHowever, several lines of evidence help us to refute this hypothesis. First, the \n\nmeasured snout-vent length of the two individuals (58.6 and 64.0mm) is consistent with A. \nn. brasiliensis (\u00c1vila-Pires, 1995; Mesquita et al., 2006; Vitt et al., 2008) but not consistent \nwith A. meridionalis (Gainsbury and Colli, 2003; Colli and Oliveira, 2011). Second, both \nindividuals were captured inside the natural forested fragments and not in the Cerrado \n\nmatrix and, as referred above, A. n. brasiliensis is a forest species and A. meridionalis is \ncharacteristic of open areas. Third, the two individuals were more divergent among each \n\nother (15 mutations), despite being captured about 2 Km apart from each other, than the \n\ntwo most divergent haplotypes from the eastern bank of the Araguaia (AnitH11 and \n\nAnitH13, 13 mutations), sampled about 28 km apart. The difference is that the two \n\nhaplotypes from FLV were sampled in two forested remnants within a matrix of Cerrado \n\nand agricultural fields, while the Araguaia haplotypes were sampled in a continuous \n\nforested area. Forth, the average pairwise divergence between the FLV and the Araguaia \n\nclade (10.1% \u00b1 2.0%) is perfectly consistent with intraspecific divergence values found \n\nbetween the Amazonian subspecies of A. nitens, or even within populations of the \nsubspecies A. nitens tandai (Glor et al., 2001). Therefore, we have reason to suspect that \nthe two clades might correspond to different subspecies of Anolis nitens, or two highly \ndivergent populations within A. nitens. The subspecies A. n. brasiliensis, which occurs in \nCerrado, was previously identified in our study area along Araguaia and Coco rivers (Vitt \n\net al., 2008). The other known subspecies of A. nitens occur in the Amazonia. Whether \nthe individuals from FLV are a different subspecies or are related to Amazonian \n\nsubspecies is dependent on including molecular data from the other subspecies in these \n\nphylogenetic analyses. If individuals captured in FLV are more related with Amazonian A. \n\nnitens, it will provide evidence for an ancient relationship between the forested remnants, \n\nipucas, and Amazonian rainforest. \n \n\n6.5.2 \u2013 Is Araguaia River a barrier for lizard species? \nThe frequent occurrence of the same haplotypes on both banks of the Araguaia \n\nriver, in A. ameiva and T. teguixin is enough to refute the hypothesis that this river might \nhave a strogn effect in limiting the gene flow in this species. Both species are abundant in \n\nthe Araguaia islands and haplotypes shared between banks are often also found in the \n\nislands. On this regard, it is important to refer that previous authors hypothesized that \n\ngene-flow could occur when extensive portions of land are passively transferred from one \n\nbank to another in a river, each time a meander loop is cut off or a new river course is \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nGenetic structure of three lizard populations \n\n141 \n \n\ncarved out within the floodplain (Haffer, 1997; Gascon et al, 1998). This is known to occur \n\nin the Araguaia, where some large islands are stable for as long as a decade (Latrubesse, \n\n2009). \n\nAnother indirect source of evidence comes from the support for the monophyly of \n\nthe populations of T. teguixin from the Araguaia basin and from Roraima, relatively to the \n\npopulations of Cuyabeno (Equador). The two Brazilian populations are separated by the \n\nlower course of several large rivers flowing from the Brazilian Shield (Araguaia, Tocantins, \n\nXing\u00fa and Tapaj\u00f3s), and of the Amazonas itself. On the other hand, several rivers like \n\nNegro, Japur\u00e1 and Napo exist between the populations of Roraima and Cuyabeno. \n\nHowever, in the latter case, the areas are separated by the headwaters of these rivers. \n\nThese findings appear not to be consistent with the predictions of the Riverine Barrier \n\nHypothesis (Haffer, 1997; Lougheed et al, 1999), since it would be expected that the river \n\nbarrier effect would be greater in the lower course of the river. \n\nA very different situation occurs with A. n. brasiliensis. Despite being no reciprocal \nmonophyly of the haplotypes from both banks, the monophyly of the western bank is \n\nstrongly supported. The eastern bank is, however, paraphyletic relatively to the western \n\nbank, which might suggest dispersal from one bank to the other (Patton et al., 2000), most \n\nprobably from the eastern (paraphyletic) to the western (monophyletic) bank. The \n\nhaplotypes from FLV are located eastern to Araguaia (and Java\u00e9s), and are much more \n\ndivergent from the Araguaia haplotypes, than both banks are from each other. However, \n\nas previously referred, the FLV clade might represent a different subspecies. Thus, we \n\nconsider that river Araguaia limitates, at least partially, the genetic flow in A. n. \nbrasiliensis. Glor and collaborators (2001) detected a very deep split between the \nsubspecies of A. nitens north and south of the Amazonas river. \n\nTupinambis teguixin and Ameiva ameiva are heliothermic lizards (Vitt and Colli, \n1994; Sartorius et al., 1999; Vitt et al, 2008b) and at least T. teguixin is known to be a \ngood swimmer (\u00c1vila-Pires, 1995; Vitt et al., 2008b). We had the opportunity, for a couple \n\nof times, to observe A. ameiva swimming in flooded pitfalls and submerging for several \ntimes when we tried to capture them. At the time, they also seem to have no problem \n\ndealing with water. Vitt and Zani (1998) found this species several times in wet ground. \n\nWe also frequently observed both species in beaches and river bluffs along Araguaia and \n\nits tributaries. On the contrary, A. n. brasiliensis was never found in these habitats, \nprobably because of thermal restrictions (Vitt et al., 2008a), since beaches and bluffs were \n\nfrequently exposed to direct sunlight. Anolis n. brasiliensis is a diurnal and non-\n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 6 \n\n142 \n \n\nheliothermic lizard, occurring almost only in shaded places or exposed to filtered sunlight  \n\n(Mesquita et al., 2006; Vitt et al., 2008a). For a forest-specialist species, a river such as \n\nAraguaia, with exposed bluffs and large sand beaches, might be an even greater barrier \n\nthan just the flowing water, much more than for heliothermic species that are frequently \n\nactive on transitional or open areas. \n\n \n\n6.5.3 \u2013 Some considerations on genus Tupinambis \nThe taxonomy of the genus Tupinambis was involved in substantial confusion until \n\nthe 1990 decade. \u00c1vila-Pires (1995) clarified part of this confusion by assigning the \n\nAmazonian form, previously known as T. nigropunctatus, to T. teguixin (which is now the \nvalid name for that species) and the Central Brazilian form, previously known as T. \nteguixin, to T. merianae. A few years later, a new species, T. quadrilineatus, was \ndescribed for the Cerrado biome, almost simultaneously by different authors (Manzani and \n\nAbe, 1997; as T. cerradensis by Colli et al. 1998). A molecular phylogeny by Fitzgerald et \nal. (1999) clarified the phylogenetic relationships inside Tupinambis, but draw attention to \nthe non-monophyletic relation between T. duseni and T. rufescens. However, these \nauthors considered them to be valid species based on morphological data. These findings \n\nwere later corroborated by Peres and Colli (2004). A new species T. palustris was \ndescribed by Manzani and Abe (2002) but was considered a junior synonim of T. teguixin \nby Peres (2003). Fitzgerald et al. (1999) found substantial genetic divergence between \n\npopulation of T. teguixin from Roraima (Brazil) and Cuyabeno (Equador). The divergence \nbetween these two populations was comparable to the divergence of valid species within \n\ngenus Tupinambis. Peres (2003) found no morphological support for geographical \nstructure within T. teguixin. \n\nThe analysis of our data together with the data by Fitzgerald et al. (1999) and an \n\nadditional sample of T. quadrilineatus generated in the study by Pellegrino et al. (2001), \n\nallowed us to clarify some issues. First, we were able to confirm the sympatry of three \n\nTupinambis species in the region of the mid-Araguaia. Despite the large size of this \n\nspecies, the sympatry of Tupinambis species was reported several times (\u00c1vila-Pires \n1995; Colli et al, 1998; Fitzgerald et al, 1999; Peres and Colli, 2003). There is a report on \n\nthe sympatry of T. duseni, T. merianae and T. teguixin in the state of Goi\u00e1s (Abe et al., \n1992), and \u00c1vila-Pires (1995) suggests the possibility of sympatry of the two latter species \n\nand T. longilineus. To our knowledge, this is however the first report on the sympatry of T. \nteguixin, T. quadrilineatus and T. merianae. Voucher specimens were only collected for T. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nGenetic structure of three lizard populations \n\n143 \n \n\nteguixin, since T. quadrilineatus (3 individuals) and T. merianae (1 individual) were only \nfound dead on road, not suitable for voucher preparation. Even though, coloration patterns \n\nwere consistent with the patterns of the latter two species, and their identification was \n\ncorroborated by molecular data analysis. The three species were detected within a short \n\nrange from each other (less than 10 Km), but in different habitats. T. teguixin was allways \ncaptured inside or near gallery forests and seasonally flooded forests around Araguaia, \n\nCoco and Java\u00e9s rivers. T. quadrilineatus was found in a road crossing a Cerrado sensu \nstrictu area, near forested patches, while T. merianae in a more open area. These findings \nare consistent with the ecology of these tree species (\u00c1vila-Pires, 1995; Colli et al, 1998; \n\nColli et al, 2002). Niche segregation might justify the frequent sympatry between such \n\nlarge lizards. \n\nSecond, by adding samples from T. quadrilineatus to phylogenetic analyses we \nfound some evidence that this species would be sister to T. longilineus. When describing \nT.  quadrilineatus (in the original reference: T. cerradensis), Colli and collaborators (1998) \nanalyzed allozyme data and found greater genetic distances between T. quadrilineatus \nand T. merianae than between the former and T. teguixin. Based on morphological data, \n\u00c1vila-Pires (1995) concluded that T. longilineus was closer to T. teguixin than to the other \nknown species. These findings were supported by the morphological data analysed by \n\nColli and collaborators (1998) and later by molecular analysis (Fitzgerald et al., 1999). It is \n\nimportant to notice that tissue samples were not available for T. longilineus in the study \nfrom Colli et al. (1998) and that T. quadrilineatus was also not included in the molecular \nanalysis by Fitzgerald et al. (1999). Thus, our findings do not contradict any of the \n\nprevious findings, but suggest that T. quadrilineatus and T. longilineus might in fact be \nsister taxa. These two species would then by closer to T. teguixin than to the species from \nthe southern clade detected by Fitzgerald et al. (1999). \n\nThird, our re-analysis of the data from Fitzgerald and collaborators, provides very \n\nlittle support for the monophyly of T. teguixin. In the original analysis, the authors found \nthat the divergence between T. teguixin from Roraima and Cuyabeno was comparable to \nsome interspecific relationships within the genus Tupinambis. Here, the monophyly of the \nRoraima and the Araguaia populations is corroborated by MP and NJ analysis, but \n\nreceives little support from BI analysis. However, even less support, in all phylogenetic \n\nanalysis, is provided to the monophyly of the three intraspecific populations of T. teguixin. \nAverage pairwise divergence between the clades corroborates that T. teguixin populations \nfrom Roraima and from the Araguaia are significantly less divergent than other taxa. The \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 6 \n\n144 \n \n\ndivergence between any of these populations and the population from Cuyabeno is \n\nhowever not significantly lower the divergence between the latter and the closest relatives \n\nto T. teguixin, which appear to be T. longilineus and T. quadrilineatus. Thus, and despite \nthe lack of support from morphological data (Peres, 2003), we reinforce the suggestion by \n\nFitzgerald and collaborators, that significant variation within T. teguixin might be found in \nan expanded analysis. \n\n \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \nWe thank Carol Loss, Juliana Justino and Jo\u00e3o Filipe Tonini, who provided crucial help \n\nduring the laboratorial work.

However, if different questions are to be addressed at the same \n\ntime, demanding different methodological approaches, a level of compromise must be \n\nachieved. To update the species check-list for a given taxonomic group and region, at the \n\nsame time that one tries to obtain data that allow the comparison of different areas, and to \n\nobtain a sufficiently large and widespread sample of some target species can become \n\nconflicting objectives. \n\nAs reported in this thesis (Chapter II), different techniques capture different sets of \n\nspecies, and individual species are more or less prone to be captured by each capture \n\ntechnique. If the objective is to try to sample as much species as possible in a particular \n\nregion, it is a common opinion that it is advisable to apply a set of different capture \n\ntechniques (e.g.: Mengak and Guyn 1987; Greenberg et al. 1994; Voss and Emmons \n\n1996; Crosswhite et al. 1999; Hutchens and DePerno, 2009). An alternative approach to \n\ncapture, which can be applied in the study of some particular taxa, is the use of artificial \n\nhabitats. Artificial pools (Gascon, 1994), artificial covers (Fellers and Drost, 1994), or \n\nartificial pipe refuges (as reported in Chapter III) can be used, with different levels of \n\nsuccess, in the study of amphibian and reptile taxa. The use of artificial habitats allows \n\nsome level of standardization, which can be important for long-term studies and \n\npopulation monitoring. The analysis of different characteristics of artificial refuges can \n\nprovide us an insight into the ecological preferences of colonizing species, as already \n\nsuggested by Johnson and Semlitsch (2003) and Pittman et al. (2008). It is important to \n\nstress that some species would certainly be more prone to use these artificial habitats, \n\nthan others, and that inter-specific comparisons might become compromised. \n\nHowever, this is a problem I found to be transversal to several capture methods. \n\nExcluding methods that result in total counts of individuals, the reliability of estimation \n\nmethods depend on several variables, such as: a) the accuracy of the observer (Hayek, \n1994); b) the size, color, vagility or any other factor that influences the detectability of a \nspecies (Lancia et al, 1996); c) the different efficiency of the method for different taxa \n(Corn, 1994); d) or the social behavior or any kind of territoriality or gregarious behavior \n(Scott and Woodward, 1994). I believe that these limitations should not be considered an \n\nimpediment to the collection and analysis of field data, rather should work as cautionary \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 7 \n\n156 \n \n\nnotes to be accounted when choosing methods and analyzing and comparing data from \n\ndifferent taxa or locations. \n\nField data are still the primary and most important kind of data for informed \n\ndecision-making regarding conservation strategies. Estimation of species richness, \n\ncomplementarity, irreplaceability (Diniz-Filho et al., 2004, 2006, 2007; Costa et al 2007) or \n\nany other dimension of biodiversity based on meta-data is a very useful approach when \n\nfield-data are sparse, unevenly distributed or even inexistent. These macro-scale are \n\nsubjected to bias (Bini et al., 2006) but might provide important insights to biodiversity \n\npatterns and point regional and local biodiversity hotspots. An example is the \n\ncorroboration of the results of Costa et al. (2007), which point lower species richness at \n\nthe periphery of Cerrado biome, by the data presented in Chapter IV. For the middle \n\nAraguaia basin, both the anuran and squamate species diversity proved to be greater \n\nthan previously estimated but, even though, not higher than in other Cerrado or \n\nAmazonian localities. Our results also corroborated previous field data (Nogueira et al, \n\n2005; Nogueira et al., 2009), which point for higher diversity in the interfluvial areas than \n\nin gallery forests, in the Cerrado biome. These findings support the idea that long-term \n\nbiodiversity assessments and monitoring are still one of the keystones of efficient wildlife \n\nconservation and management planning. \n\n \n\n \n\n7.2 \u2013 The dynamic relation between river and herps \n\nLarge rivers, just as mountains and canyons, are frequently considered as \n\npotential barriers to the dispersal of species and the gene flow between populations. Here, \n\nwe tested the hypothesis that the Araguaia could be a barrier to a different set of species \n\n(Chapters V and VI). In most cases, in turned out that species were able to cross the river \n\nand exchange genes. This was the case for the three studied amphibian species (Chapter \n\nV). However, in the case of the least vagile species, Elachistocleis ovalis, two divergent \nlineages were found. The single fact that some haplotypes were shared between \n\nriverbanks should not constitute evidence that Araguaia River was not the cause of this \n\ndivergence. The fact that individuals could migrate from on bank to the other does not \n\ninvalidate that it was sufficiently low to allow diversification. However, in such a situation, it \n\nwould be expected that the populations on the two sides of the river were sister to each \n\nother (Patton et al, 2000; Haffer, 2008). However, our phylogenetic analyses failed to \n\nsupport the monophyly of the two Araguaia clades relatively to a very distant population \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nFinal Discussion  \n\n157 \n \n\nfrom Panama. This result better suggests that the Araguaia is probably an area of \n\nsecondary contact between two non-sister populations originated elsewhere (Patton et al., \n\n2000), and that these are able to cross Araguaia at some extent. \n\nThe results obtained with lizards were not much different (Chapter VI). The \n\nAraguaia seems to constitute no barrier for the two teiid lizards, which are larger, more \n\nactive and less habitat-restricted than Anolis nitens brasiliensis. The former, Ameiva \nameiva and Tupinambis teguixin are not restricted to forested areas (Vitt and Colli, 1994; \n\u00c1vila-Pires, 1995; Sartorius et al., 1999) and spend much time actively searching for food \n\n(Colli et al., 1997; Vitt and Zani, 1998). Anolis n. brasiliensis, on the other hand, spends \nmost of its time within forested areas, in fixed positions, ambushing preys (Vitt and Zani, \n\n1998; Vitt et al., 2008). This species appears not to be able to cross the Araguaia River, at \n\nleast frequently enough to leave a genetic signature. In the case of this polychrotid lizard, \n\nwe found no evidence of haplotype share across the river and the western bank was \n\nmonophyletic relatively to the eastern bank. This result is consistent with a scenario of \n\ndispersal of a original population from one side to the other of Araguaia. The hypothesis \n\nthat Araguaia might be a barrier to this species is supported in two ways. First, at the \n\nsubspecies level, the phylogeny of Anolis nitens appears to be influenced by the Amazon \nRiver (Glor et al., 2001). Second, despite the much larger sampling effort in the eastern \n\nside of the Araguaia, only one Anolis species was found on the eastern bank. However, a \nsecond species, Anolis ortonii was once captured in the western bank, very near to the \nriver (Chapter IV). Anolis ortonii is a species widely distributed in Amazonia and in the \nnorthern portion of the Atlantic Forest (Peres and Donoso-Barros, 1986; \u00c1vila-Pires, \n\n1995). Because, despite all sampling effort, we were never able to find this species on the \n\neastern bank, we believe that the Araguaia River might constitute a distribution limit for \n\nthis species. \n\nIn resume, the Araguaia River appears to play different roles with different species \n\n(see also Rocha et al., submitted), most often not limiting their dispersal. The dynamics of \n\nthis river, with the accretion and isolation of large islands (Latrubesse, 2009), might \n\nprovide the appropriate vehicle for transferring the individuals, and their genes, from one \n\nbank to the other, as already suggested by other authors (Haffer, 1997; Gascon et al, \n\n1998). For some Amazonian species, like the large Tupinambis teguixin, the alluvial and \ngallery forest of the Araguaia and its tributaries are better explained as corridors, \n\nextending their distribution into the Cerrado biome (\u00c1vila-Pires,1995). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 7 \n\n158 \n \n\n7.3 \u2013 Conservation areas and species assemblages \n\nA project for the establishment of an ecological corridor, with an area of 10 million \n\nhectares, in the region of the middle Araguaia has been in the paper for a long time \n\n(Arruda, 2003; MMA, 2005). According to these authors, this corridor would comprise: four \n\nindigenous areas, three sustainable use areas, and one federal and two state strict \n\nconservation areas. It would comprise 36 municipalities from the states of Goi\u00e1s, Mato \n\nGrosso, Tocantins and Par\u00e1. However, the implementation depends on the participative \n\nmanagement of all the intervenient parts, which has not yet been achieved. In some \n\ncases, the borders of the conservation areas included in the project still are, or recently \n\nwere, matter of debate (MPF-TO, 2005; MPF-TO, 2010). The area of implementation of \n\nthe ecological corridor Bananal-Araguaia lies within the deforestation arc between \n\nAmazonia and Cerrado, a region under strong deforestation pressure (Azevedo-Ramos \n\nand Galatti, 2002; Vieira et al., 2008). \n\nThe human pressure in the five municipalities that comprise our study area goes \n\nwith the general trend (Table 7.1). It becomes clear from the data in the table that human \n\npressure is much higher in the western border of Araguaia River, in Santana do Araguaia, \n\nstate of Par\u00e1, where no state or federal conservation units exist. On the eastern side, the \n\nmunicipality of Pium encompasses both the Parque Estadual do Cant\u00e3o (PEC) and \n\nParque Nacional do Araguaia (PNA). The remaining area of Pium municipality and from \n\nthe municipalities of Caseara and Marian\u00f3polis are located within the \u00c1rea de Protec\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nAmbiental do Bananal/Cant\u00e3o (APABC). The latter is a sustainable use area and human \n\npressure is much higher in APABC than in PEC, where only a handful of ribeirinhos is \nallowed to reside. \n\n \nTable 7.1 \u2013 Anthropogenic pressure in the study area.

Despite \n\nbeing less intensively sampled, Fazenda Santa F\u00e9 (FSF), in the state of Par\u00e1, also \n\nappears to have the potential to harbor some species that do not occur in the eastern \n\nborder of the Araguaia River. In a recent study by Negr\u00f5es et al. (2011), FSF presented a \n\nhigher species richness for medium and large mammals, than PEC. In our study, only one \n\nspecies captured in FSF was not present in PEC or APABC. The highly seasonal nature \n\nof the Araguaia alluvial plains, and its low heterogeneity, are surely an impediment for the \n\nestablishment of several vertebrate species, which are able to colonize the surrounding \n\nareas, which are drier and more heterogeneous. In resume, it becomes clear that \n\nsuccessful conservation will result not only from the creation of strict conservation areas, \n\nbut also from integration with surrounding areas. Indigenous lands, sustainable use areas \n\nand private forests might play an important role in the preservation of regional fauna and \n\necosystems, an opinion shared by several other researchers (Peres, 2004; Campos and \n\nNepstad, 2005; Rylands and Brandon, 2005; Azevedo-Ramos et al., 2006; Gardner et al, \n\n2006; Negr\u00f5es et al., 2011). \n\n \n\n \n\n7.4 \u2013 Is there room for everyone? \nBesides deforestation rates, the region of the arc of deforestation in the \n\nSoutheastern Amazonia is in the top list for several other reasons: number and size of \n\nbovine herds; violence against rural workers; slave work; land concentration and, recently, \n\nland redistribution (Girardi et al., 2008). Data from South America and other tropical areas \n\nindicate that environmental degradation is intimately connected with social instability and \n\npoverty (Fragoso et al., 2004; Rudel, 2005; Sanchez et al., 2005). However, and in the \n\nparticular case of Brazil, environmental degradation is also the result of decades of \n\ninefficient large-scale agricultural and logging activities, many times with the political and \n\neconomical support of national governments (Klink and Moreira, 2002; Fearnside, 2005; \n\nRudel et al., 2005; Silva et al., 2005; Clement, 2006; Ratter et al., 2006). A recent study by \n\nRangel and co-authors (2007) found that patterns of modern agriculture and cattle \n\nranching were better predictors of conflict with conservation planning, than human \n\npopulation density. \n\n\n\n \n \n \nChapter 7 \n\n160 \n \n\nBrazilian Ministry of Environment recently released a list of the top 100 illegal \n\ndeforesters in Amazonia (MMA, 2008), which included nine settlements of rural landless \n\npeople, with the remaining positions belonging to large private corporations or individual \n\nowners related with logging, livestock and agricultural activity. Almost all the 100 top \n\ndeforesters come from the states of Mato Grosso, Par\u00e1 and Rond\u00f4nia, with the few \n\nremaining scattered by other Amazonian states. Judicial measures were taken against the \n\ntransgressors. Unfortunately, deforested areas can no longer be turned into pristine areas. \n\nThe solution might pass by the enforcement of the law in the deforestation border. \n\nHowever, there are other possible and complementary measures. There have been some \n\nexamples of successful integration of smallholders, indigenous and local communities in \n\nthe preservation of very large tracts of forest (McGrath et al., 2004; Sears and Pinedo-\n\nVasquez, 2004; Silvius, 2004; Campos and Nepstad, 2006). All these cases imply a level \n\nof use of forest resources, such as small-scale selective logging or subsistence hunting, \n\nbut prevent deforestation and leave untouched large nuclear areas. Thus, measures such \n\nas the mediation of conflicts between the different stakeholders, the enforcement of \n\nBrazilian law and the integration of local communities in conservation policies, providing \n\nalternative sources of income, might turn to be as important as surveying and \n\nunderstanding biodiversity. The question is if we should try to preserve natural habitats \n\ndespite the existence of local human populations or should we preserve it for and with the \n\nhelp of these communities? \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nFinal Discussion  \n\n161 \n \n\nReferences \nArruda M.B.
