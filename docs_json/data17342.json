Esse ciclo\ntermodina?mico recuperaria parte do calor residual associado aos gases\nde exausta?o das turbinas na planta, para gerac?a?o de pote?ncia adicio-\nnal, permitindo um decre?scimo na carga das mesmas e, portanto no\nconsumo de combust??vel. O modelamento do processo foi desenvolvido\ncom o propo?sito de caracterizar a operac?a?o normal da plataforma e\nassim estabelecer as condic?o?es de refere?ncia para comparar o desempe-\nnho energe?tico da mesma. A partir da informac?a?o obtida do modelo,\numa ana?lise exerge?tica permitiu identificar as operac?o?es com maior ir-\nreversibilidade e tambe?m com potencial para recuperac?a?o da exergia\nperdida. Ale?m disso demonstrou diferenc?as significativas na ordem de\ngrandeza entre os fluxos de exergia associados a?s correntes de o?leo e\nga?s produzidos e as demais correntes relacionadas com o seu proces-\nsamento. Considerando isto, foram considerados tre?s indicadores de\neficie?ncia, dois relacionados com os fluxos de exergia e um relacionado\ncom o gasto energe?tico. De outro lado, o sistema ORC foi definido\ntendo em conta os resultados de estudos recentes focados na selec?a?o\ndo fluido de trabalho e na configurac?a?o do ciclo, visando as melhores\ncondic?o?es de operac?a?o do ciclo enquadrado dentro das restric?o?es impos-\ntas pelo processo. Considerando a grande variabilidade dos para?metros\nde produc?a?o deste tipo de instalac?a?o, a comparac?a?o dos resultados do\nmodelo incluindo o ORC integrado com o processo foi feita ao longo de\num perfil de produc?a?o que contempla a variac?a?o de cinco para?metros\nde maneira independente: (i) vaza?o de o?leo, (ii) vaza?o de a?gua de\nproduc?a?o, (iii) pressa?o de poc?o, (iv) vaza?o de ga?s injetado e (v) vaza?o de\na?gua injetada. Os resultados mostraram que a implementac?a?o do ciclo\ntraz um melhoramento dos indicadores de eficie?ncia energe?tica propos-\ntos, independentemente da variac?a?o nos para?metros de produc?a?o, com\num melhoramento dos indicadores relativamente uniforme ao longo do\nperfil analisado. Os para?metros de produc?a?o com maior impacto so-\nbre a pote?ncia gerada pelo ORC correspondem a?s vazo?es de ga?s e de\na?gua injetadas no reservato?rio, sendo essas as operac?o?es que demandam\nmaior pote?ncia e portanto uma maior produc?a?o de gases de exausta?o\nnas turbinas. Em geral, a metodologia adotada pretende avaliar o im-\npacto de uma tecnologia para o melhoramento da eficie?ncia energe?tica\n\n\n\n(nesse caso o ORC) em um processo industrial existente, considerando\na caracterizac?a?o detalhada do processo em questa?o e a variac?a?o dos\npara?metros mais relevantes de produc?a?o, de tal forma que os resulta-\ndos oferec?am um panorama mais amplo na hora de aplicar este tipo de\nsistema.\nPalavras-chave: Eficie?ncia Energe?tica, Processamento de O?leo e Ga?s,\nAna?lise Exerge?tica, Ciclo Rankine Orga?nico, FPSO.\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe present dissertation contemplates the energy performance enhance-\nment of an oil and gas processing platform by means of the hypothetical\nincorporation of an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC). This thermodyna-\nmic cycle would recover part of the waste heat associated with exhaust\ngases coming from gas turbines in order to produce additional power,\nallowing a decrease in their load and consequently in their fuel consump-\ntion. The process modeling was developed with the aim of characte-\nrizing the plant normal operation and thereby establish the reference\nconditions for comparing its energy efficiency. With the information\nobtained from the model, a detailed exergy analysis enabled the identi-\nfication of the operations with greatest irreversibility and with potential\nfor the exergy losses recovering. In addition, it showed a great diffe-\nrence between the exergy fluxes associated with produced oil and gas\nstreams when compared with the other streams associated with their\nprocessing. Considering that, the use of three energy efficiency indi-\ncators was analyzed, two of these indicators are related to the exergy\nfluxes and the other with the energetic expense. On the other side, the\nORC system was defined taking into account the results of recent stu-\ndies focused on the selection of the ORC working fluid and the ORC\nconfiguration, aiming the best operating conditions framed into pro-\ncess constraints. Considering the great variability of the production\nparameters in this kind of installations, the comparison of the model\nresults with the ORC integrated was made along a production profile\nthat comprises the variation of five parameters independently: (i) oil\nflow, (ii) production water flow, (iii) well pressure, (iv) injected gas flow\nand (v) injected water flow. The results demonstrated that the imple-\nmentation of the ORC improves the proposed indicators, independently\nof the variation of the chosen production parameters. The energy im-\nprovement was found relatively uniform along the production profile.\nThe production parameters with a greater impact over the ORC output\ncorrespond to the gas and water flows injected back into the reservoir.\nThese operations demand the highest amount of power and thus the\ngreatest production of exhaust gases at gas turbines. This procedure\npretends to evaluate the effect of an energy enhancement technology\n(in this case the ORC) in an existing process, characterizing its beha-\nvior under variable production conditions. In this way, the results can\ngive a wider panorama when applying this kind of systems for energy\n\n\n\nperformance improvement.\nKeywords: Energy Efficiency, Oil and Gas Processing, Exergy Analy-\nsis, Organic Rankine Cycle, FPSO.\n\n\n\nLIST OF FIGURES\n\nFigure 1 World oil and gas demand (IEA, 2012). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7\n\nFigure 2 Production profiles of some Brazilian fields (SIMMONS,\n2009). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8\n\nFigure 3 Typical operation scheme of an oil and gas production\nplant (WILKINSON, 2006). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11\n\nFigure 4 Schemes of most common types of offshore platforms\n(MAHONEY, 2013). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13\n\nFigure 5 Basic operation scheme of an FPSO (WILKINSON, 2006). 14\n\nFigure 6 Basic layout of an FPSO topside. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18\n\nFigure 7 Example of an FPSO topside. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19\n\nFigure 8 Basic PFD of a typical FPSO process plant. . . . . . . . . . . . 20\n\nFigure 9 Basic scheme of an ORC system . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 22\n\nFigure 10 Basic scheme of an regenerative ORC system . . . . . . . . . . 23\n\nFigure 11 Types of fluids (HEBERLE; PREIBINGER; BRU?GGEMANN,\n2012). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25\n\nFigure 12 Effect of the enthalpy of vaporization of the working fluid\n(BAO; ZHAO, 2013). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 26\n\nFigure 13 Difference between cycle efficiency and power output\n(DECLAYE, 2009). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 27\n\nFigure 14 Relation between the critical temperature and the pa-\nrameter ?

INTRODUCTION\n\nRecently, the enhancement of the energy efficiency in the oil in-\ndustry has attracted much attention, mainly due to the different chal-\nlenges coming from three current circumstances: (i) the growing oil\nand gas demand, (ii) the necessity of reducing CO2 and other green-\nhouse gas emissions and (iii) the increasing production costs. According\nto a recent forecast done by the International Energy Agency (IEA),\nconsidering the existing policy commitments and assuming the imple-\nmentation of those recently announced, by 2035 the world oil demand\nwill increase around 15% and a remarkable rise of 50% is projected for\ngas demand (IEA, 2012). On the other hand, a gradual enforcement of\nthe existing legislation and the establishment of new commitments re-\nlated to the pollution control are expected in order to avoid a dangerous\nclimate change, limiting consequently the CO2 emissions generated by\nthe industry (IEA, 2008; LUDENA; MIGUEL; SCHUSCHNY, 2012). These\nfactors are aggravated by the rapid depletion of the known reserves of\noil and gas (SIMMONS, 2009; IEA, 2012) and the increasing costs associ-\nated with the development of the new oil and gas fields (SHIMAMURA,\n2002; BULLER, 2009).\n\nThe offshore production has been an important part of the de-\nvelopment of the oil and gas industry during the past two decades,\nabout 33% of world oil production by 2007 was obtained from offshore\nplatforms (KOCAMAN, 2008) and its contribution is projected to be\nrelatively stable until 2035. Considering that over 45% of currently\nknown oil resources are located under the sea and about a quarter of\nthese resources corresponds to deepwater (water with a depth of 400\nmeters or above), a production growth of 81% is estimated for this\ntype of fields (IEA, 2012). It should be noted that this notable figure\nis predicted even considering the technical difficulties and high costs\ninherent to the exploitation of oil and gas at remote locations.\n\nDiverse types of offshore installations have been spread around\nthe world, of which the floating platforms are the most suitable for\ndeepwater production (BARTON, 2009; KINNEY, 2012). Among them,\nthe Floating Production, Storage and Offloading (FPSO) units present\ntechnical advantages especially in the development of short-lived and\nmarginal fields in remote locations where fixed platforms were imprac-\ntical and uneconomical (SHIMAMURA, 2002; GORDON, 2012). Nowa-\ndays, Petrobras has the second largest number of FPSO units (about\n10 owned and 30 operated), representing about 15% of all the existing\n\n\n\n2\n\nworldwide (MAHONEY; KITHAS, 2013; CRAGER, 2010).\nThe main purpose of the production plant on an FPSO is to sep-\n\narate the well fluid into oil, gas and water meeting the specifications for\ntheir export or further treatment. The most common operations carried\nout for the separation of these streams includes (ARNOLD; STEWART,\n2008): (i) well fluid gathering and well pressure reduction, (ii) gravity\nseparation, (iii) oil treatment and storage, (iv) gas compression and\ndehydration and (v) water treatment and pumping. Depending on the\nspecific characteristics of the well fluid and field development, the FPSO\nmay contain operations like (BOTHAMLEY, 2004): (i) gas lift/injection,\n(ii) gas liquefaction and storage, (iii) gas export via pipelines, (iv) gas\nflaring or (v) seawater treatment and injection.\n\nThese installations include the production of the energy required\nby their own processes, using a part of the oil (or gas) produced in the\nplant as fuel for the generation of power, cold and heat. Improving the\nuse of this energy through the plant will reduce the fuel consumption,\nwhich has important benefits like the abatement of pollutant emissions\nand the reduction of operating costs. In that direction, the IEA (2008)\nhas shown the combined heat and power (CHP) as a good alternative\nto increase the energy efficiency in various industrial sectors in the\nshort term. By other side, the Department of Energy of United States\n(DOE) (BCS, 2008) has presented the main opportunities, challenges\nand barriers to the research, development and demonstration (RD&amp;D)\nfor the development of technology related with waste heat recovery\n(WHR) in some industries.\n\nNumerous investigations have been focused on the utilization\nof the waste heat to activate thermodynamic cycles supplying power,\ncold or upgraded heat (LITTLE; GARIMELLA, 2011; DENG; WANG; HAN,\n2011). Among these systems, the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is a rec-\nognized technology for power generation that already has been used to\nimprove the efficiency in many industrial operations (TCHANCHE et al.,\n2011). Particularly, the integration of ORC in offshore processing plat-\nforms has been the focus of a handful of recent studies (LARSEN et al.,\n2013; PIEROBON et al., 2013; PIEROBON; NGUYEN, 2012a). However,\nthese studies have not considered the inherent variation in the plat-\nform process conditions along its lifespan. Consequently, more work is\nneeded in order to determine the actual advantages of the ORC inte-\ngration under variable production circumstances within the platform.\n\nThe application of exergy concept and the exergy balance is a\nwell-known and accepted technique employed to delimit and quantify\n\n\n\n3\n\nthe energy efficiency in chemical and physical operations, which deter-\nmines the maximum useful work obtainable from a system interacting\nwith its surroundings, as well its potential destroyed by irreversibil-\nity (SZARGUT; MORRIS; STEWARD, 1988). Despite its usefulness, this\nmethod has not yet been fully adopted in many industrial sectors \u2013\nincluding the petrochemical segment, principally due to the absence of\na strategy of implementation, the low priority given and the lack of\ninformation to work with such kind of analysis (GRIP et al., 2011).\n\nConsidering the usefulness of the exergy balance and the cur-\nrent situation of the offshore industry, this study formulates an exergy\nanalysis of a Brazilian FPSO to characterize its energy performance,\nand then analyzes the effect of the incorporation of an ORC over its\nefficiency. The development of this work contemplates the following\nsubjects: (i) production plant and ORC modeling, (ii) calculation of\nthe exergy associated with petroleum and its fractions, (iii) use of ad-\nequate energy performance indicators, (iv) coupling of the ORC to the\nplant and (v) effect of the main production parameters over the en-\nergy efficiency of the plant. The document is organized in sections as\ndescribed in the paragraphs below.\n\nThe first section corresponds to the bibliographic review, where\nthe main concepts and theoretical basis are summarized. This section\ncovers aspects as the oil and gas production, the ORC operation and\nits utilization in the waste heat recovery.\n\nThe methodology section describes the steps proposed in order\nto obtain the results expected in this work. The process model was\ndeveloped considering the design conditions of the plant, in order to\nestablish the magnitude of its operations as well as their mass and\nenergy balances. Next, a rigorous exergy analysis was carried out in\norder to identify the operations and processes with the greatest irre-\nversibility and the highest exergy losses. Based on these results, various\nperformance indicators were proposed for the comparison of the energy\nefficiency of the plant when coupling the ORC. The configuration and\nthe working fluid of this system were established based on previous\nstudies focused on its optimization (BRANCHINI; PASCALE; PERETTO,\n2013; PIEROBON et al., 2013). Finally, the behavior of the proposed in-\ndicators was analyzed along a production profile formed by 16 scenarios\nvarying five production parameters independently. the parameters con-\nsidered are: (i) produced oil flow, (ii) production water flow, (iii) well\npressure, (iv) injected gas flow and (v) injected water flow.\n\nThe third section summarizes and discusses the obtained results\nin order to recognize the impact of the ORC over the energy perfor-\n\n\n\n4\n\nmance of the plant accounting the variation of its main production\nparameters.\n\nFinally, in the conclusion section, the main findings of this work\nare presented. The main contribution of the present study consists in\nthe proposal of a procedure aiming the effect of an energy enhancement\ntechnology (in this case the ORC) in an existing process, characterizing\nits behavior under variable production conditions. In this way, the\nresults can give a wider panorama when applying this kind of systems\nwhere it could lead a great impact increasing the energy efficiency (e.g.\noffshore oil and gas processing).\n\n1.1 OBJECTIVES\n\nIn accordance with the outlined scope, the main purpose of this\nstudy is to identify clearly the effect of an ORC over the energetic\nefficiency of an offshore platform along a variable production profile,\nsuch that the influence of each production parameter can be analyzed\nseparately. The following aims are contemplated in order to achieve\nthis purpose:\n\n1. Develop the process model in order to determine the mass and\nenergy balances of each operation within the process. The model\nmust be adequate to analyze the behavior of the process condi-\ntions under variable inputs, within the design constraints of the\nplant.\n\n2. Carry out an exergy analysis of the plant in order to quantify the\nexergy fluxes within the plant as well as the irreversibility in each\noperation and the potential exergy losses to be recovered by the\nORC. This analysis includes the proper calculation of the exergy\nfluxes associated with hydrocarbon streams (i.e. petroleum and\nits fractions).\n\n3. Choose appropriate exergy performance indicators, in order to\nmake evident the effect of the chosen production parameters over\nthe plant efficiency. These indicators must be related with the\nplant purpose and operation.\n\n4. Develop the integrated model (the production plant with inte-\ngrated ORC) and quantify the effect over the energy efficiency of\nthe platform. This effect will be established by comparison of the\nindicators proposed in the item above.\n\n\n\n5\n\n5. Determine the behavior of the exergy efficiency indicators under\nvariable operating conditions, such that the convenience of the\nORC implementation under different production scenarios can\nbe established.\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n7\n\n2 BIBLIOGRAPHIC REVIEW\n\n2.1 BACKGROUND\n\nAccording to the data published by IEA (2012), the world oil\nand gas demand by 2035 will grow about 2.75 million of cubic meters\nper day and 1765 billion of cubic meters per year respectively, with-\nout considering future changes in current environmental policies (see\nFig. 1). This fact seems to be positive for oil and gas market, but this\nwould be true if the current sources of oil and natural gas were enough\nto meet these goals. The present situation indicates that the proved oil\nand gas reserves are being rapidly depleted and are not enough to sup-\nply projected demand. In order to illustrate that, Fig. 2 presents the\nproduction profiles of some fields located in Brazil (SIMMONS, 2009).\nIt would be necessary to find new oil and gas resources, but from the\ninformation presented by Barton (2009) and Shimamura (2002), it can\nbe inferred that it is becoming more difficult to find new reservoirs\nwith an acceptable technical and economic feasibility. This signifies\nthat costs associated with oil and gas production will tend to increase,\nwhich would imply a serious impact over the oil and gas market, and\nconsequently over the world economy.\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 World oil and gas demand (IEA, 2012).\n\n\n\n8\n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Production profiles of some Brazilian fields (SIMMONS, 2009).\n\nBy the other hand, over the past three decades, the climate\nchange has become the most influencing aspect relating to the hu-\nmankind sustainability and has compelled governments and policy mak-\ners to create commitments about the reduction of CO2 and other pollu-\ntant emissions (LUDENA; MIGUEL; SCHUSCHNY, 2012). These premises\naffect in a great extent the operation of the oil and gas plants, promot-\ning the investment in cleaner and more efficient systems of production.\nConsidering the goals established about economic and environmental\naspects, the use of technologies in order to improve the energy efficiency\nof new as well as existing plants will be become a requisite more than\na choice for this industry.\n\nIn that way, DOE through BCS (2008), indicates the WHR as a\ngood alternative to affront this challenging scenario, considering that\nas much as 20% to 50% of the energy consumed by the industrial sec-\ntor is ultimately lost via waste heat. According to this reference, the\ncurrent profile of utilization of WHR is delineated mainly by the follow-\ning characteristics: (i) WHR frequently implemented, but constrained\nby factors such as costs and temperature limits, (ii) most unrecovered\nheat is at low temperatures and (iii) there are sectors where WHR is not\ncommon due to factors such as chemical composition of heat carriers or\n\n\n\n9\n\neconomic aspects required for recovery.

Thus, next sections introduce some key concepts\nconcerning the operation of oil and gas production plants, its energy\nefficiency, the ORC systems and their process modeling.\n\n\n\n11\n\n2.2 OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PLANTS\n\n2.2.1 Operation and types\n\nIt is well known that the crude oil and natural gas are the main\nfeedstock of innumerable industries and they are extracted from sedi-\nmentary basins, where they have been formed and trapped for over tens\nof millions of years (WILKINSON, 2006). The only way to extract them\nis by drilling, that implies a withdrawal of diverse materials as water,\nsands and salts together with the well fluid. These impurities need to\nbe removed from crude (or gas) before being processed at refineries or\nused as fuels. This configures the main purpose of the production plant,\nthat consist in separating the well fluid into oil, gas and water meeting\nthe specifications for their export or further treatment or disposal.\n\nThe physical and chemical characteristics of crude and gas can\nvary widely from field to field, influencing the process scheme and con-\nditions of the production plant. A typical scheme of operation is shown\nin Fig. 3, nevertheless some stages can be added or omitted depending\non the crude and gas characterization (see section 2.2.3).\n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Typical operation scheme of an oil and gas production plant\n(WILKINSON, 2006).\n\nIt is difficult to classify production plants, because they differ due\n\n\n\n12\n\nto production rates, fluid properties, sale and disposal requirements,\nlocation, and operation mode (ARNOLD; STEWART, 2008). Consider-\ning only location, production facilities can be separated into two main\ngroups: onshore and offshore installations. According IEA (2012), the\ngrowth potential of the offshore installations (or platforms) is signifi-\ncantly greater, given the estimation of remaining recoverable conven-\ntional oil under the sea of about 1200 billion barrels (about 45% of total\nestimated). Particularly, deepwater production (offshore platforms op-\nerating in water depths in excess of 400 m) reports an expansion from\n4.8 million of barrels per day in 2011 to about 8.7 million of barrels per\nday by 2035.\n\nDifferent types of platforms have been developed, some of these\nbeing more adequate to the production at deepwater. Considering the\ntype of anchoring employed, Fig. 4 presents the schemes of various\ntypes of platforms. Among these types, the FPSO units present several\nadvantages as (SHIMAMURA, 2002):\n\n\u2022 Adaptability for water depth.\n\n\u2022 Early deployment.\n\n\u2022 These units are self-contained.\n\n\u2022 These units are movable and relocatable.\n\n\u2022 Can be combined with other offshore facilities.\n\n\u2022 Their use can expand oil trading.\n\n\u2022 Has segregated storage.\n\nAs the industry tackles deeper and deeper water, FPSOs con-\nnected to subsea wellheads are replacing fixed platforms as the main\ndevelopment technique. Figure 5 shows a more detailed scheme of an\nFPSO unit (WILKINSON, 2006).\n\nCurrently, Brazil accounts 28 FPSO units of 147 existing world-\nwide (reported until august 2013) and its national oil company Petro-\nbras has a notable participation in FPSO market, accounting 10 owned\nand operated units (MAHONEY; KITHAS, 2013).\n\n2.2.2 Process description\n\nThe subsystems (blocks) presented in Fig. 3 can be briefly de-\nscribed as follows (ARNOLD; STEWART, 2008):\n\n\n\n13\n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Schemes of most common types of offshore platforms (MA-\nHONEY, 2013).\n\n\n\n14\n\nFigure 5 \u2013 Basic operation scheme of an FPSO (WILKINSON, 2006).\n\n1. Gathering system\n\nThe production systems begins at the wellhead, which should\ninclude at least a valve called choke. Most of the pressure drop\nbetween the well flowing tubing pressure (FTP) and the initial\nseparator operating pressure occurs across this valve. The choke\nopening determines the flow through the wellhead and permits a\nrough control over the depletion rate of well.\n\nWhen two or more wells are commingled in a production plant,\nit is necessary to install a piping arrangement called manifold, in\norder to allow flow from any one well to be isolated and diverted\ntowards the test production systems.\n\n2. Separation system\n\nThe function of separators and other equipment in this system\nis to make a gross separation of gas, and water from oil. This\nseparation takes place due to the difference of densities between\nthe aqueous, oily and gas phases. Heating of the inlet stream\npromotes this separation, up to some degree depending on the\ncomposition and water content of oil. Generally, this operation\n\n\n\n15\n\nis accomplished in multiple pressure stages with the purpose of\nstabilizing the major quantity of light hydrocarbon molecules in\nthe oil phase. In a given separator, a higher pressure favors liquid\nyield, but incorporates too light components into oil that will be\nlost in atmospheric storage. On the other hand, a lower pressure\nfavors medium component losses through the gas outlet.\n\n3. Oil Treatment system\n\nThe purpose of this system is to reduce the water content of oil\ndown to the sales requisite (generally 1% BSW or less). Generally,\nit implies heating of oil stream and sometimes the application of\nelectrostatic fields. The grade of heating and electrostatic treat-\nment depends on the trend to form stable emulsions between the\noil and water. This stage is commonly done at a pressure slightly\nhigher than the atmosphere in order to promote its vapor stabi-\nlization.\n\n4. Storage system\n\nIn the FPSO this system corresponds to the tanker (incorporated\nin the unit), where the oil is accumulated until it is dispatched to\nexternal tankers or to other installations via pipeline.\n\n5. Gas dehydration system\n\nThis system removes the humidity from gas, in order to meet the\nsales or injection specification. The dehydration is accomplished\ngenerally by contact with a dehydrating agent as triethylene gly-\ncol (TEG) or methanol. Depending on the available gas pressure\nand its water content, an intermediate compression stage (boost-\ning) can be needed before this operation.\n\n6. Compression\n\nThis system must provide the required pressure to the gas stream\nin order to accomplish any of the following operations:\n\n\u2022 Gas export (pipeline): When possible, the major part of the\nseparated gas is sold and exported onshore via pipelines.\nThe capacity of compressors and therefore their power con-\nsumption depends on the gas flow and the pressure drop\nthrough the lines. It is common to find subsea gas lines up\nto 200 km long (WILKINSON, 2006).\n\n\u2022 Gas re-injection: It consists in a way of achieving a supple-\nmentary oil recovery maintaining the reservoir pressure by\n\n\n\n16\n\nreturning the natural gas back through strategically placed\nwells in the field. This technique bolsters the main drive as\nlong as possible.\n\n\u2022 Gas lift: It involves increasing the amount of gas produced\nwith the oil by injecting gas directly into the flowing column\nin a well rather than into the reservoir. Gas lift is accom-\nplished by using special valves set up at various depths and\nthen controlling the amount of gas entering the flow stream.\nThe increase in gas/oil ratio reduces the pressure needed to\ndrive the oil to the surface (WILKINSON, 2006).\n\n7. Flare system\n\nThis system has two basic functions: (i) vents and/or burn safety\nthe excess of gas of the plant when there is a surplus, and (ii) re-\nceives and directs the gas and vapors expelled from safety devices\nwhen an overpressure occurs. Normally, continuous gas venting\nor burning is avoided mainly due to environmental restrictions.\n\n8. Oily water separation system\n\nThis system takes the oil and solid traces away from the produc-\ntion water stream in order to meet the specifications to be dis-\nposed overboard. Normally, this is accomplished using settling,\naeration and other related equipment.\n\n9. Filtration system\n\nThis system separates smaller particles than the former stage and\nis accomplished by means of membranes, activated coal and other\nfiltering media. The purpose of the filtration system is to meet\nthe water specifications requirements in order to be injected back\nto the reservoir. In addition, it is common to take and filter\ndirectly seawater and discard all the production water.\n\n10. Deareation system\n\nThis system removes the dissolved gas from filtrated water in\norder to avoid the growth of aerobic bacteria that can favor a\ncollapse of the reservoir.\n\n11. Pumping and water injection system\n\nThe treated water is injected back into the reservoir to maintain\nthe reservoir pressure and thus take a secondary oil recovery. The\npower consumed by this system depends on the injection depth\n\n\n\n17\n\nand the required water flow. Generally, several pumping stages\nare necessary to achieve the required pressure rise.\n\nThere are other subsystems that are not included in Fig. 3, but\nalso are necessary in the plant operation:\n\n\u2022 Safety system\nIncludes alarms, automatic shutdowns, back-up units, flare stacks\n(as mentioned above) and firefighting equipment, plus strict ad-\nministrative procedures and frequently practiced emergency con-\ntainment and evacuation plans.\n\n\u2022 Utility systems\nInclude power generation and facilities for normal services, all of\nwhich can be, and frequently are, powered by gas or oil being\nprocessed in the plant.\n\nCommonly, the power generation system of an FPSO unit consists\nin a set of turbines (gas or diesel fueled) working at part-load for\navailability and reliability reasons.\n\nThe above-mentioned operations can vary according with the\nmain purpose of the platform. According to the work of Bothamley\n(2004), which summarizes the primary options available for offshore\nprocessing, the majority of the offshore platforms falls into the following\ntwo categories:\n\n\u2022 Stabilized, crude meeting sales specifications and dehydrated gas\nproduced offshore.\n\n\u2022 Unstabilized, wet crude and dehydrated gas produced offshore.\n\nAdditionally, there is a relatively small number of oil platforms\noffshore that employ additional gas processing, (e.g. Hydrocarbon dew\npoint control, natural gas liquids recovery or liquefaction of natural\ngas) in order to produce both oil and gas products meeting sales spec-\nifications.\n\nFigure 6 presents a typical layout of the process plant on board of\nan FPSO, showing the distribution of the main subsystems of the plant.\nOn the other hand, a photograph of an FPSO topside is presented in\nFig. 7 in order to illustrate the equipment arrangement within the plant.\n\nIn order to analyze the streams and processes that are performed\nwithin a plant, a simplified PFD (Process Flow Diagram) is presented\n\n\n\n18\n\nFigure 6 \u2013 Basic layout of an FPSO topside.\n\nin Fig. 8. This scheme corresponds to an FPSO operating in the San-\ntos basin (WASCO, 2012), which is analyzed in the present work. Ap-\npendix A presents the complete scheme of operation, which includes\nsecondary material and energy streams, as well as the operations within\neach subsystem (shown as blocks in Fig. 8). The symbols and nomen-\nclature used are also presented there. A detailed process description is\npresented in Sec. 3.2.1.\n\n2.2.3 Oil Characterization\n\nThis subsection introduces the most common methods for char-\nacterizing crude oils and petroleum fractions, and for estimating their\nthermophysical properties. In order to simulate properly the oil-related\nprocesses, it is necessary to have a good understanding of the com-\nposition information and thermophysical properties of crude oils and\npetroleum fractions. However, the complexity of molecular composi-\ntion of crude oils and petroleum fractions makes it hardly possible to\nidentify individual molecules. Instead, there are standardized methods\nto characterize crude oils and petroleum fractions, which are commonly\ncompiled in a technical summary known as crude assay.\n\nA typical crude assay includes two types of information for an oil\nsample: (i) bulk properties and (ii) fractional properties. Bulk prop-\nerties include specific gravity, sulfur content, nitrogen content, metal\n(Ni, V, Fe etc.) content, Watson (UOP) K factor, C/H ratio, pour\npoint, flash point, freeze point, smoke point, aniline point, cloud point,\n\n\n\n19\n\nFigure 7 \u2013 Example of an FPSO topside.\n\nviscosity, carbon residue, light hydrocarbon yields (C1-C4), acid num-\nber, refractive index, lower and higher heating values and boiling point\ncurve. The most representative bulk properties are briefly described in\nfollowing paragraphs.Chang, Pashikanti e Liu (2012) presents a detailed\ndescription of all above-mentioned properties.\n\nSpecific gravity (SG) : generally is measured using the API (Amer-\nican Petroleum Institute) gravity to specify the specific gravity of the\ncrude oil as ?API = (141.5/SG) ? 131.5. SG is the specific gravity\ndefined as the ratio of the density of the crude oil to the density of\nwater both measured at 15.6 ?C (60 ?F). The API gravity reports a\nvalue lower than 10?API for very heavy crudes, from 10 to 30?API for\nheavy crudes, from 30 to 40?API for medium crudes, and a value above\n40?API for light crudes.\n\nGross heat of combustion or higher heating value (HHV): is the\namount of heat released by the complete combustion of a unit quantity\nof fuel. The gross heat of combustion is obtained by cooling down all\nproducts of the combustion to the temperature before the combustion,\nand by condensing all the water vapor formed during combustion.\n\n\n\n20\n\nFigure 8 \u2013 Basic PFD of a typical FPSO process plant.\n\nNet heat of combustion or lower heating value (LHV): is obtained\nby subtracting the enthalpy of vaporization of the water vapor formed\nby the combustion from the higher heating value.\n\nTrue boiling point (TBP) distillation curve: results from using\nthe U. S. Bureau of Mines Hempel method and the ASTM D-285 test\nprocedure. However, there is a trend toward applying the ASTM D2892\nprocedure, instead of the TBP. A key result from a distillation test is\nthe boiling point curve, that is, the boiling point of the oil fraction\nversus the fraction of oil vaporized.\n\nWatson (UOP) K factor : Is an approximate index of paraffinic-\nity, with higher values corresponding to a high degree of saturation. It\nis related to the mean average boiling point by the following expression\n(WATSON; NELSON, 1933):\n\n\n\n21\n\nK =\n1.216 3\n\n?\nTb,avg.\n\nSG\n(2.1)\n\nwhere\n\nK: Watson UOPK factor.\nTb,avg.: Mean Average Boiling Point, K.\nSG: Bulk specific gravity (15?C/15?C).\n\nThis factor must be between 8 (highly aromatic or naphthenic)\nand 15 (highly paraffinic)(ASPENTECH, 2011).\n\nBy the other hand, fractional properties of the oil sample re-\nflect the property and composition for specific boiling-point range to\nproperly refine it into different end products such as gasoline, diesel\nand raw materials for chemical process. Fractional properties usually\ncontain paraffins, naphthenes and aromatics (PNA) contents, sulfur\ncontent, nitrogen content for each boiling-point range, octane number\nof gasoline, freezing point, cetane index and smoke point for kerosene\nand diesel fuels. These properties and methods to obtain them are\ndetailed by Chang, Pashikanti e Liu (2012).\n\nTwo indicators affect directly the material balance of the plant:\nthe bottom sediments and water (BSW) and the gas to oil ratio (GOR).\nBSW corresponds to the volumetric ratio of water extracted together\nwith the well fluid (expressed as a percentage) and GOR is the ratio of\nvolumetric flow of produced gas to the volumetric flow of crude oil for\ncrude oil and gas mixture at standard conditions (measured at T=15?C\nand P=101.325 kPa). The importance of these parameters is associated\nwith their variability over the period of development of a field.\n\n2.3 ORGANIC RANKINE CYCLE (ORC)\n\nAccording to Chen, Goswami e Stefanakos (2010), Bao e Zhao\n(2013) and Little e Garimella (2011), previous studies have analyzed\nvarious advanced thermodynamic cycles such as the ORC, supercritical\nRankine cycle, Kaline cycle, Goswami cycle, Maloney-Robertson cycle\nand trilateral flash cycle for the conversion of heat into available power.\n\nParticularly, the ORC appears with some key advantages when\ncompared with Kalina cycle and trilateral flash cycle (BAO; ZHAO,\n2013):\n\n\u2022 ORC has simpler structure.\n\n\u2022 ORC presents less expansion complexity.\n\n\n\n22\n\n\u2022 ORC has a high reliability.\n\n\u2022 ORC has a simpler maintenance.\n\nIn addition, with the aim to improve the energy efficiency, the\nORC can be easily combined with other thermodynamic cycles such\nas thermo-electric generator, fuel cell, internal combustion engine, mi-\ncroturbines, seawater desalinization system, Brayton cycle, and gas\nturbine-modular helium reactor. Furthermore, it also can be used as\nprime movers of combined cooling and power systems as the ORVC\n(Organic Rankine\u2013Vapor Compression) cycle.\n\n2.3.1 Fundamentals\n\nThe ORC, which has the same configuration as conventional\nsteam Rankine cycle but uses organic substances with low boiling points\nas working fluids, can use various types of heat source. Tchanche et\nal. (2011) present a review of some ORC applications such as indus-\ntrial waste heat, solar energy, geothermal energy, biomass energy, ocean\nenergy, etc. Figure 9 shows the basic scheme of operation of the ORC.\n\nFigure 9 \u2013 Basic scheme of an ORC system\n\nThe ORC working fluid (state F05) is fed to the pump (P-F01)\nthat increases its pressure (state F06) and leads the fluid to the econo-\nmizer (E-F03) where it reach its saturation temperature (F08). Next,\nthe fluid across the evaporator (E-F02), wherein the fluid phase change\n\n\n\n23\n\noccurs (state F09). Normally, the saturated vapor is then superheated\nacross E-F01 and expanded in T-F01 (state F11), which produces the\nshaft work of the cycle (WT-F01). It should be noted that the heat\nconsumed by the economizer, the evaporator and the superheater is\nsupplied by the waste heat source (directly or indirectly). Finally, the\nvapor stream from expander outlet is condensed in E-F05 , and re-\nturned back to the pump. Depending on the characteristics of the\nexpansion of fluid (explained in sec. 2.3.2), it may be appropriated the\nuse of a regenerator, which transfers heat from the expander outlet to\nthe economizer inlet. Figure 10 shows the configuration and the cycle\nof a regenerative ORC.\n\nFigure 10 \u2013 Basic scheme of an regenerative ORC system\n\nCompared with the conventional Rankine cycle, the ORC demon-\nstrates several advantages such as (TCHANCHE et al., 2011):\n\n\u2022 Commonly, it is necessary a lesser amount of heat during the\nevaporation process.\n\n\u2022 The evaporation process takes place at lower pressure and tem-\nperature.\n\n\u2022 Particularly for dry fluids, the expansion process ends in the vapor\nregion and hence the superheating is not required and the risk of\nblade erosion is avoided.\n\n\n\n24\n\n\u2022 The smaller temperature difference between evaporation and con-\ndensation also means that the pressure drop ratio will be smaller,\nthus simple single stage turbines can be used.\n\n2.3.2 Working fluid selection\n\nOne of the most important aspects in the development of ORCs\nis the working fluid selection. The quantity of generated power, the\nenergy efficiency and economic viability of the ORC are strongly af-\nfected by the working fluid choose. A working fluid must not only have\nthe necessary thermo-physical properties that match the application\nbut also possess adequate chemical stability in the desired temperature\nrange. There are numerous investigations carried out about the screen-\ning, comparison and selection of the best candidates. Particularly Bao\ne Zhao (2013), and Chen, Goswami e Stefanakos (2010) have reviewed\nextensively the research done in this area and their work is the main\ninformation source of following subsections.\n\n2.3.2.1 Types of working fluids\n\nThe working fluids can be categorized according to the vapor\nsaturation curve. This characteristic affects the fluid applicability, cycle\nefficiency and arrangement of ORC equipment. There are three types\nof vapor saturation curves in the temperature-entropy (T-s) diagram:\n(i) dry fluids with a positive slope, (ii) wet fluids with a negative slope\nand (iii) isentropic fluids with nearly infinitely slopes. Figure 11 shows\nthe T-s diagrams for these three types of fluids.\n\nThe manner how this characteristic influences the performance\nand the number of equipment within the ORC is related with the con-\ndensation in the expander outlet. A wet fluid condensates during the\nexpansion process because the negative slope of its vapor saturation\ncurve. This effect must be avoided since the presence of liquid inside\nexpander may damage its blades and reduces its isentropic efficiency.\nNormally a superheating is required before the fluid enters to the ex-\npander, implying an increasing cost of the system and a reduction its\nefficiency.\n\nOn the other side, the main advantage of the dry and isentropic\nfluids consist in that they expand without phase change, thus super-\nheating is not required. In spite of this, a slight superheating is rec-\n\n\n\n25\n\nFigure 11 \u2013 Types of fluids (HEBERLE; PREIBINGER; BRU?GGEMANN,\n2012).\n\nommended to guarantee only vapor at expander outlet. Moreover, in\nthe case of dry fluid, generally a regenerator is used in order to reduce\nthe condenser load and increase the efficiency of the cycle, which im-\nplies an increasing complexity and cost. This preliminarily indicates\nisentropic fluids as the most interesting candidates to be implemented\nin an ORC. However, a more detailed analysis (HUNG et al., 2010) has\nindicated that wet fluids with very steep saturated vapor curves have\nbetter overall performance in energy conversion efficiencies than dry\nfluids and isentropic fluids. In spite of that, they are not always suit-\nable for ORC systems when other thermophysical properties are taken\ninto consideration.\n\nA practical indicator used to visualize how \u201ddry\u201d or \u201dwet\u201d a\nworking fluid is, consists in the inverse of the vapor saturation curve\nslope (?T/?s). Defining ? = ?s/?T , the type of fluid can be classified\nby its value, i.e. ? &lt;0 corresponds to a wet fluid, ? = 0 corresponds\nto an isentropic fluid and ? > 0 to a dry fluid.\n\n2.3.2.2 Enthalpy of vaporization\n\nHigh enthalpy of vaporization enables most of the available heat\nto be added to the ORC and produces a larger quantity of work per\n\n\n\n26\n\nunit of circulating fluid with the evaporation temperature and other\nparameters defined (CHEN; GOSWAMI; STEFANAKOS, 2010). However,\nwhen the heat source is the waste heat, organic fluids with lower specific\nvaporization heat are preferred. As explained by Bao e Zhao (2013), a\nlower specific heat of vaporization allows the temperature profile across\nthe economizer-evaporator-separator to be closer to the waste heat pro-\nfile, which means less irreversibility through the process, thus better\nperformance of the ORC. This is shown in Fig. 12, where the pinch\npoint difference (PPD) is indicated.\n\nFigure 12 \u2013 Effect of the enthalpy of vaporization of the working fluid\n(BAO; ZHAO, 2013).\n\nDeclaye (2009) mentions that the purpose of an ORC for waste\nheat recovery is not always meet the best energy efficiency, but produce\nthe greater amount of power and presents the case illustrated in Fig. 13.\nThis system recovers heat coming from a hot water source at 105 ?C\nusing a ketone as working fluid. The operation conditions in the second\ncase (right side) demonstrated the worst efficiency (more irreversibility)\nbut generated more than three times the power reported by the first\ncase (left side).\n\n\n\n27\n\nFigure 13 \u2013 Difference between cycle efficiency and power output (DE-\nCLAYE, 2009).\n\n2.3.2.3 Density\n\nThis parameter has a great impact over the sizing, and thus over\nthe initial investment of the ORC equipment. Considering that a low\ndensity leads to a higher volume flow rate, the pressure drop in the\nheat exchangers is increased (thus the power consumed by the pump)\nand the size of the expander must be increased.\n\n2.3.2.4 Critical temperature\n\nPrevious study (BRUNO et al., 2008) has demonstrated that em-\nploying a fluid with higher critical temperature results in higher effi-\nciency but lower condensing pressure, when the optimum high and low\npressure were determined in order to meet the maximum first law effi-\nciency of the saturated cycle. However, a high critical temperature also\ninvolves working at specific vapor densities much lower than the critical\ndensity. This reduced density shows a great impact on the design of\nthe cycles, since the components need to be oversized (QUOILIN et al.,\n2012).\n\nIn a general way, the critical point of a working fluid suggest the\nproper operating temperature range for the working fluid in liquid and\n\n\n\n28\n\nvapor forms. Figure 14 presents a relation between the critical temper-\nature and the parameter ? for various working fluids studied previously,\naccording to the review done by Chen, Goswami e Stefanakos (2010).\n\nFigure 14 \u2013 Relation between the critical temperature and the param-\neter ? for various candidates (CHEN; GOSWAMI; STEFANAKOS, 2010).\n\n2.3.2.5 Chemical stability and corrosiveness of the fluid\n\nOrganic fluids usually suffer chemical deterioration at high tem-\nperatures. Thus, commonly the maximum operating temperature is\nlimited by the chemical stability of the working fluid. In addition, as\nmentioned by BCS (2008), the corrosion and scaling inside of the equip-\nment associated with waste heat recovery is an important barrier to the\nimplementation of these systems. Hence, the working fluid should be\nas chemically stable and non-corrosive as possible.\n\nIn many cases, the stability characteristics of the working fluid\nhave promoted the use or intermediate fluid in order to transfer heat\n\n\n\n29\n\nfrom higher temperature sources at a lower temperature level.\n\n2.3.2.6 Environmental aspects\n\nThe main environmental parameters are: (i) the ozone deple-\ntion potential (ODP) and (ii) global warming potential (GWP), which\nrepresent substances potential to contribute to ozone degradation and\nglobal warming. Due to environmental concerns, some working fluids\nhave been phased out, such as R-11, R-114 and R-115, while some\nothers are being phased out in 2020 or 2030 (CHEN; GOSWAMI; STE-\nFANAKOS, 2010). This criterion can be used in order to screen prelim-\ninarily the working fluids candidates and discard those that must be\navoided by international protocols.\n\n2.3.2.7 Safety\n\nThis parameter is related to the level of danger when dealing\nwith the working fluid. Generally, characteristics as non-corrosive, non-\nflammable and non-toxic are expected, but are not practically found for\na specific candidate. Particularly for longer alkanes, autoignition is a\nproblem at temperatures above 200?C.\n\nAnother important thermodynamic property is the freezing point\nof the fluid, which must be below the lowest operating temperature in\nthe cycle. The fluid must also work in an acceptable pressure range.\nVery high pressure or high vacuum has a tendency to impact the relia-\nbility of the cycle or increase the cost (CHEN; GOSWAMI; STEFANAKOS,\n2010).\n\n2.4 EXERGY ANALYSIS OF OIL AND GAS PLATFORMS\n\nRelatively few works have been focused on analyzing the exergy\nperformance of the oil and gas production installations. Oliveira e\nHombeeck (1997) studied a Brazilian platform, whose process includes\nthe crude heating using a WHR system in combination with a furnace\nin order to improve the separation of phases. Also the gas compression\nsystem and the oil pumping system were included. Their analysis indi-\ncated the compression and the separation as the most exergy-consuming\nprocesses within the plant. In the same way, the worst exergy efficiency\nwas reported for the separation operation (22%) due to the high tem-\n\n\n\n30\n\nperature difference between the crude and exhaust gases. This work\nwas conducted using Hysim (predecessor of Hysys) and an overall ex-\nergy efficiency of 9.7% was obtained.\n\nBy other side, Silva (2008) developed an exergy analysis of two\nBrazilian production installations, one located onshore and another lo-\ncated offshore. The methodology proposed in this dissertation adopts\nthe entire plants as the combination of three independent systems:\n(i) the separation module, (ii) the gas compression module and (iii)\nthe power generation module. The reported efficiencies for the base\ncase were 24.9% using the thermodynamic degree of perfection (?P \u2013\nsee Sec. 3.3.3) and 7.9%, reported as the actual exergy efficiency. The\nsoftware used in this dissertation was EES.\n\nVoldsund et al. (2010) simulated a specific North Sea offshore\nplatform by using Hysys. The platform analyzed included separation,\nrecompression (boost), gas injection and oil pumping systems. Results\nindicated the gas boost and injection as the systems with largest ex-\nergy destruction. In this case, an overall exergy efficiency of 32% was\nreported and the main exergy losses were associated with the gas recy-\ncling in compressors.\n\nMore recently, Nguyen et al. (2013) simulated a platform includ-\ning auxiliary systems as the gas dehydration unit, production manifold\nand production water treatment. Results were obtained combining\nthree different programs: (i) Aspen plus for the processing plant, (ii)\nDNA for modeling the gas turbines and (iii) Hysys for modeling the\ndehydration unit. The authors separated the analysis of the processing\nplant from that carried out for power generation system, and pointed\nout the gas injection as the process with highest exergy destruction\nwhen the combustor chambers of the power generation system are not\nconsidered. Analogously, the largest exergy losses were found in the\nexhaust gases outlet.\n\n2.5 INTEGRATION OF ORC IN OIL AND GAS PLATFORMS\n\nCurrently, publications concerning the use of ORC systems in\nthe WHR within offshore facilities are limited. Pierobon e Nguyen\n(2012b) modeled an ORC system for the WHR from the exhaust gases\ncoming from a SGT-500 turbine used in a platform located at North\nSea. Their methodology was focused on the working fluid selection of\nthe cycle, in order to obtain a higher power output. The results indi-\ncated cyclohexane as the best candidate among four chosen candidates,\n\n\n\n31\n\nwhich reported a thermal efficiency enhancement of 12.9% considering\nthe combined cycle. Posteriorly Pierobon et al. (2013) conducted an op-\ntimization analysis aiming the reduction of the size of the components\nthat make up the same ORC system meeting the maximum thermal\nefficiency. The results pointed out the acetone and the cyclopentane\nas two optimal working fluids, the later reporting a greater thermal\nefficiency.\n\n\n\n32\n\n\n\n33\n\n3 METHODOLOGY\n\nIn order to investigate the behavior of the operation conditions\nof the plant, a process simulation is carried out to determine the mass\nand energy balances of each subsystem involved. This simulation was\ndeveloped considering the design parameters supplied in its engineering\ndocumentation (WASCO, 2012), whose values correspond to the occu-\npation of 100% of the capacity of the plant. Missing information were\nproperly set according to specific literature (MAXWELL, 1968; ARNOLD;\nSTEWART, 2008). The model was developed using two well-known engi-\nneering software with two different levels of detailing and different crite-\nria applied; the chosen alternatives were Hysys and Engineering Equa-\ntion Solver (EES). Specifically, Hysys (or its former version Hysim) has\nbeen used in previous works to develop exergy analysis of oil produc-\ntion plants, (e.g. Nguyen et al. (2012), Pierobon e Nguyen (2012b),\nOliveira e Hombeeck (1997)), mainly due to its algorithms for model-\ning crude oil and its fractions from standardized data. On the other\nhand, numerous academic studies focused on ORC have been devel-\noped different analysis using EES (e.g. Li, Wang e Du (2012), Little e\nGarimella (2011)), because of its capability to work with the thermo-\ndynamic properties of common substances as continuous functions, as\nwell as other multi-purpose characteristics. The data calculated using\nboth programs are presented with the purpose of enabling the identi-\nfication of the differences between the obtained results and to provide\na contribution for future works that contemplate the use of Hysys or\nEES for this type of simulation.\n\nBased on the energy balance of the plant, the heat losses as well\nthe power demand in all operations in the plant were quantified. The\npossible sources to activate the ORC and its potential of use were iden-\ntified in accordance with these results. In addition, appropriate exergy\nbalances were developed with the intention of determining the actual\npotential of utilization of these sources (specifically, the exergy of the\nwaste heat corresponds to the maximum amount theoretically attain-\nable by the ORC) and to identify the operations where an improvement\nwould have a greater impact on the energy efficiency of the plant.\n\nSpecial attention was taken in the calculation of the exergy using\nHysys, mainly due to the coherence required between the method used\nby this program for modeling the physical properties of crude fractions\nand the method of estimation of its chemical properties (including its\nchemical exergy). Considering the basic information commonly used\n\n\n\n34\n\nto characterize a crude oil, a hybrid strategy was adopted integrating\nprevious studies and establishing some assumptions based on available\nliterature. This strategy was developed in the following steps: (i) esti-\nmation of the molecular weight distribution and physical properties of\ncrude in accordance with the method proposed by Whitson (1983) and\nTwu (1984), (ii) estimation of the higher heating value (gross calorific\nvalue) of each fraction according Maxwell (1968) data, (iii) estimation\nof the elemental composition of each fraction using the Boie equation\napud. Ringen, Lanum e Miknis (1979) and (iv) estimation of the chem-\nical exergy considering each fraction as a liquid technical fuel according\nthe method described by Szargut, Morris e Steward (1988) and Rivero,\nRendon e Monroy (1999).\n\nThe same operating conditions were used in the EES model, but\nadopting a simpler strategy to model the crude fractions: physical and\nchemical properties of whole crude oil were determined using Maxwell\n(1968) data; then its chemical exergy was approximated to its LHV as\nmentioned by Rivero, Rendon e Monroy (1999). The main drawback\nof this methodology is that the mass transfer between the liquid and\nvapor phases is not quantified due to the omission of the composition\nand the equilibrium of phases. Another remarkable difference between\nthe models, is that in the case of Hysys, where the crude is modeled\nas a mixture of several hydrocarbon fractions, the calculation of the\ntotal exergy of material streams includes the mixing exergy term \u2013as\nproposed by Hinderink et al. (1996), in order to incorporate the exergy\ndestruction associated with the entropy generated by mixing. This\nterm was not necessary in the EES model, since the compositions of\nthe material streams remains constant through the plant.\n\nOnce the exergy analysis of the plant was completed, the losses\nand destruction of exergy in each operation were established, so that\nthe energy efficiency of the process scheme can be compared adequately\nwith that incorporating the ORC. In that way, this work proposes the\nuse of three indicators: two related to exergy efficiency and another as-\nsociated with the energy consumption per volumetric unit of produced\noil.\n\nConsidering the great variability of the production parameters in\nthis kind of installations, a comparison of the results using the ORC was\nmade along a production profile. This profile is formed by 16 scenarios,\nand comprises the variation of five parameters independently: (i) oil\nflow, (ii) production water flow, (iii) well pressure, (iv) injected gas\nflow and (v) injected water flow.\n\nThe incorporation of the ORC system was proposed recovering\n\n\n\n35\n\nwaste heat from the exhaust gases coming from the gas turbines and the\npower generated by this system was discounted from their total load.\nWith the purpose of taking advantage of the current configuration of the\nplant, the ORC was modeled coupled to the HTF (Heat Transfer Fluid)\ncirculation system (described below). By the other side, cyclopentane\nwas selected as the ORC working fluid based on the results of a recent\nstudy focused on the optimization of this cycle (PIEROBON et al., 2013).\nThe operation scheme of the ORC was established based on its vapor\nsaturation curve, as explained in sec. 2.3.2.1.\n\nThis methodology contemplates the combination of various pro-\ncedures in order to obtain a reliable panorama of the energy perfor-\nmance of an oil and gas production platform and its improvement using\nan innovative technology as the ORC. These procedures were adapted\nconsidering a small availability of information about the characteriza-\ntion of the well fluids, a fact that is common in this industry.\n\n3.1 OIL CHARACTERIZATION\n\n3.1.1 Physical Properties\n\nIn order to obtain a reliable simulation of the production plant,\nan important key is the proper calculation of the thermophysical prop-\nerties of the crude oil and petroleum fractions. The algorithms of cal-\nculation included in Hysys permit to estimate these properties directly\nfrom the standard data obtained from laboratory and its method is\nbroadly accepted in the oil industry. On the other hand, Maxwell\n(1968) is a great compendium of thermophysical and chemical prop-\nerties based on experimental data of various petroleum fractions with\ndifferent characteristics, and it can be used as a good reference to easily\ncharacterize a crude (or fraction) from basic information. On account\nof that, this reference was used for the estimation of the thermophysical\nand chemical properties in the simulation case developed in EES. The\ncomparison of values obtained from these two methods will permit to\nvalidate the order of magnitude of the results and to distinguish how\nthe grade of detail used in crude characterization affects its calculated\nparameters.\n\n\n\n36\n\n3.1.1.1 Hysys cases\n\nThe algorithm used by Hysys to characterize the crude and its\nfractions can be outlined as follows (ASPENTECH, 2011):\n\n1. An adjusted TBP curve is generated from two of the following\nbulk properties of crude (user supplied): (i) standard specific\ngravity, (ii) Watson UOPK characterization factor and (iii) molec-\nular weight. Hysys uses the methodology proposed by Whit-\nson (1983), where the molar distribution of crude (mole frac-\ntion/molecular weight relation) is adjusted as a three-parameter\ngamma probability function. These parameters are dependent on\nthe molecular weight of crude, which can be calculated from its\nUOPK factor and its standard specific gravity.\n\n2. From this curve, several pseudocomponents are generated accord-\ning the following procedure, as explained by Chang, Pashikanti e\nLiu (2012):\n\n\u2022 The curve is cut into an arbitrary number of intervals in or-\nder to define the number of pseudocomponents. The recom-\nmended number of intervals can vary from 8 to 30 depending\non the boiling point range of the curve.\n\n\u2022 The normal boiling point (NBP) is determined for each in-\nterval by equalizing the areas between the TBP curve and\na horizontal line representing the NBP temperature. This\nis shown in Fig. 15, with the gray areas representing the\nequalized areas.\n\n\u2022 The density distribution of pseudocomponents is calculated\nassuming a constant UOPK factor throughout the entire\nboiling range.\n\n3. Main thermophysical properties are calculated for each pseudo-\ncomponent from its specific gravity, boiling point and UOPK fac-\ntor. The models used by Hysys to determine these properties are\nexplained by Chang, Pashikanti e Liu (2012) and are summarized\nas follows:\n\n\u2022 Molecular weight and critical properties: Corresponds to the\nmodel proposed by Twu (1984), which uses correlations for\nthe molecular weight, specific gravity and critical properties\nof a group of pure n-alkanes ( C1 to C100) as a reference\n\n\n\n37\n\nFigure 15 \u2013 Determination of the normal boiling point (NBP) of each\npseudocomponent (ASPENTECH, 2011).\n\nsystem. These correlations are adjusted appropriately by\nthe inclusion of a correction term depending on the boiling\ntemperature and specific gravity of each pseudocomponent.\n\n\u2022 Acentric factor: The expression used in for the calculation\nof acentric factor is shown in Eq. 3.1.\n\n? = ?log\n10\n\n(\nPv\n\n?\n\nr\n\n)\n? 1.0 (3.1)\n\nwhere ? corresponds to the acentric factor and Pv\n?\n\nr corre-\nsponds to the reduced pressure at a reduced temperature\n(Tr) equivalent to 0.7.\n\n\u2022 Density (liquid phase): Even when Hysys uses an equation\nof state approach for refinery modeling (i.e. Peng-Robinson\nmethod), density of each pseudocomponent (liquid) is calcu-\nlated independently to ensure accurate results. Specifically,\nthe method chosen for the calculation of the density of liq-\nuids in the developed model is the Spencer-Danner method\nwith corresponding states liquid density (COSTALD) cor-\nrection for pressure.\n\n\u2022 Heat capacity (vapor phase): represents the vapor heat ca-\npacity of the pseudocomponent at a given standard condi-\ntion. The standard conditions typically refer to 15 ?C and 1\natm. The heat capacities of hydrocarbons do not vary signif-\nicantly over a wide range of temperatures, so very accurate\n\n\n\n38\n\nheat capacities are not necessary for good modeling results.\nThe procedure used by Hysys in this case corresponds to the\nLee-Kesler method.\n\n\u2022 Heat capacity (liquid phase): The method used by Hysys\nto calculate the heat capacity of pseudocomponents (liquid\nphase) corresponds to the Lee-Kesler method when 145 K\n&lt;T &lt;0.8 Tc and a correlation recommended by API when\nTr &lt;0.85.\n\n\u2022 Thermodynamic model: The chosen method to model the\nPVT (Pressure-Volume-Temperature) behavior of the pseu-\ndocomponents and their mixtures was the Peng-Robinson\nEOS (Equation of State). This cubic equation requires three\nmain properties: critical temperature, critical pressure and\nacentric factor. In general, the interaction parameters for\npseudocomponents can be set to 0 without changing model\nresults.\n\n3.1.1.2 EES cases\n\nThe algorithm implemented in EES incorporates data obtained\nfrom Maxwell (1968) depending on the calculation needed to analyze\nthe physical exergy of oil. Basically, the only information needed to\nthe estimation of enthalpy and entropy of oil was a correlation of the\nspecific heat as a function of temperature. Figure 16 reproduces the\ndata found in this reference.\n\n3.1.2 Chemical exergy\n\nThe calculation of the chemical exergy of oil was carried out\nbased partly on the procedure initially proposed by Szargut, Morris e\nSteward (1988) and then adjusted by Rivero, Rendon e Monroy (1999)\nthat relates the chemical exergy of oil fractions with their elemental\ncomposition and LHV. This procedure considers molecular structures\nof oil fractions as formed principally by C (carbon), H (Hydrogen),\nN (Nitrogen), O (Oxygen) and S (sulfur) atoms. Since this informa-\ntion is not commonly available in routine crude analysis (including the\ncrude studied in this work), the incorporation of other techniques was\nneeded in order to estimate adequately these properties from known\ndata. In the case of the heat of combustion, data were obtained from\n\n\n\n39\n\nFigure 16 \u2013 Specific heat of crude fractions as a function of temperature\nand its standard specific gravity (MAXWELL, 1968).\n\nMaxwell (1968), where the LHV and HHV can be estimated directly\nfrom the specific gravity of the pseudocomponent and its UOPK factor;\nFig. 17 reproduces the data for a UOPK factor of 12. On the other\nhand, the elemental composition was determined using the Boie equa-\ntion (Eq. 3.2) apud. Ringen, Lanum e Miknis (1979) that relates the\nelemental composition of a crude fraction with its HHV.\n\nHHVi = 35170 xC,i + 116252 xH,i + 6280.5 xN,i\n\n+ 10467.5 xS,i ? 11095.5 xO,i (3.2)\n\nwhere HHVi is the higher heating value (kJ/kg) of the pseudo-\ncomponent i. xC,i, xH,i, xN,i, xS,i and xO,i correspond to its mass\nfractions of C, H, N, S and O respectively.\n\nThe values of the sulfur and nitrogen content was assumed based\n\n\n\n40\n\nFigure 17 \u2013 Heat of combustion of crude fractions as function of its\nstandard specific gravity (MAXWELL, 1968).\n\non a crude analysis available online (BG Group, 2012), that corresponds\nto a field located relatively next to the studied platform. These values\nwere assumed constant and oxygen content was adjusted to meet the\nmolecular weight of each pseudocomponent. Once the elemental com-\nposition was determined, the correction factor ? is calculated using the\nexpression presented by Rivero, Rendon e Monroy (1999) (see Eq. 3.3).\n\n?i = 1.0401 + 0.0864 \u00b7\nxH,i\nxC,i\n\n+ 0.0216 \u00b7\nxO,i\nxC,i\n\n+ 0.2169 \u00b7\nxS\nxC,i\n\n\u00b7\n(\n\n1 ? 1.0314 \u00b7\nxH,i\nxC,i\n\n)\n+ 0.0214 \u00b7\n\nxN\nxC,i\n\n(3.3)\n\nThe specific chemical exergy of each pseudocomponent (bch,i) is\nthen calculated using eq. 3.4.\n\nbch,i = ?i \u00b7 LHVi (3.4)\n\nwhere LHVi corresponds to the lower heating value of pseudo-\ncomponent i (kJ/kg).\n\n\n\n41\n\nThe referenced method establishes the specific chemical exergy\n(b?ch) of a mixture (in molar basis) as the sum of the contribution of\neach component plus a compositional term, as shown in Eq. 3.5.\n\nb?ch,oil =\n?\n\nzi \u00b7 b?ch,i + R T0\n?\n\nzi ln (zi \u00b7 ?i) (3.5)\n\nwhere b?ch,oil corresponds to the specific chemical exergy of the\noil fraction in kJ/kmol. zi and ?i correspond to the molar fraction and\nactivity coefficient of the component i.\n\nHowever, in this work the compositional addend was replaced\nby a term called mixing exergy (?mixb) as proposed by Hinderink et\nal. (1996), which quantifies the effect of the composition over the total\nexergy of a multicomponent stream. As shown in Eq. 3.6, this term\ncorresponds to the difference between the sum of the exergy contribu-\ntion of each component and the total exergy of the stream (bm). Its\ncalculation is explained in Sec. 3.3.1.\n\n?mixb = b\nm ?\n\n?\nxi \u00b7 bi (3.6)\n\nIn accordance with this adoption, the specific chemical exergy\nof crude was defined simply as the sum of the contribution of each\ncomponent (in mass basis) as shown in Eq. 3.7.\n\nbch,oil =\n?\n\nxi \u00b7 bch,i (3.7)\n\nIn the case where the components are known (e.g. methane), the\nspecific chemical exergy was determined from the standard chemical\nexergy data available in (SZARGUT; MORRIS; STEWARD, 1988). Analo-\ngously to eq. 3.7, a more general expression (see Eq. 3.8) was adopted\nfor streams including known components as well as the pseudocompo-\nnents.\n\nbch =\n?\n\nxi \u00b7 bch,i +\n?\n\nxj \u00b7 bch,j (3.8)\n\nwhere bch,i and bch,j correspond to the specific chemical exergy\nassociated with the pseudocomponents and associated with the known\ncomponents respectively (kJ/kg).\n\nAppendix B shows the code integrated to Hysys for implement-\ning the calculation of the chemical exergy of each material stream.\nConversely, for the cases developed using EES, the specific chemical\nexergy was approximated to the LHV of whole crude (i.e. without con-\nsidering its composition), accordingly with Rivero, Rendon e Monroy\n(1999) when no compositional data were available.\n\n\n\n42\n\n3.2 PLANT MODELING\n\n3.2.1 Plant description\n\n3.2.1.1 Separation plant\n\nFigure 18 \u2013 Basic PFD (Process Flow Diagram) of the separation plant.\n\nAs mentioned above, the considered production plant corresponds\nto an FPSO located at the Santos basin (Brazil). The main purpose of\nthe process is to separate the well fluid into oil, gas and water meet-\ning the specifications for their export/further treatment. Figure 18\npresents a simplified scheme of operation, a more detailed scheme is\n\n\n\n43\n\npresented in Appendix A. The well fluid (FLUID) is throttled through\na choke (valve L-B00) to meet the pressure level of the first separation\nstage, which is formed by the heat exchanger E-B01, where the well\nfluid is preheated with the exported oil stream (B09) and the separator\nV-B01, where significant amounts of gas (B11) and water (B21) are\nremoved from the oil stream (B03). Next, the oil stream is throttled\ntrough valve L-B01 and heated in the heat exchanger E-B02 in order\nto promote further separation of gas and water in the separator V-B02\n(streams B12 and B23 respectively). The heat is supplied to E-B02 by\nthe circulation of a heat transfer fluid (streams E07 and E01), which\nwithdraws heat from the exhaust gases coming from the power gener-\nation subsystem through the heat exchanger E-E01. The separation\nis accomplished with an electrostatic separator for meeting the final\nspecifications of the oil stream (not shown) and a further separation in\nseparator V-B03 at lower pressure. Then, the oil is pumped (P-B01)\nthrough E-B01 and dispatched to the tankers (stream OIL), previous\ncooling with seawater in the cooler E-B02. By the other hand, the wa-\nter separated in V-B02 (B23) is pumped back (P-B02) and mixed with\nthe inlet wellfluid in order to promote the phases separation prior to\nthe first separation stage. The main production water stream coming\nfrom V-B01 is directed to the water treatment system (not shown) to\nmeet the required conditions for its disposal, then is throttled through\nvalve L-B04 and cooled with seawater in cooler E-B04 before being\ndischarged on board.\n\n3.2.1.2 Boost system\n\nThe gas separated in V-B01, V-B02 and V-B03 is directed to the\ngas boost subsystem (BOOST), where the streams at lower pressures\nare compressed up to an intermediate pressure level before being com-\npressed for injection/export in the gas injection subsystem (GAS INJ.).\nA simplified scheme of the gas boost system is presented in Fig. 19, a\nmore detailed scheme is presented in Appendix A.\n\nThe gas coming from V-B03 (B14) is compressed by C-C01 up\nto second separation stage pressure (stream B12), then both streams\nare mixed and cooled with seawater through cooler E-C01. The liq-\nuids formed by condensation are removed from the gas stream in the\nseparator V-C01 and sent back to V-B03 (B26). Next, the gas stream\n(C06) is compressed (C-C02) up to an intermediate pressure slightly\nless than the first separation stage (stream B11) and is cooled with\n\n\n\n44\n\nFigure 19 \u2013 Basic PFD (Process Flow Diagram) of the boost system.\n\nseawater in E-C02. The condensates separated (V-C02) are returned\nto V-C01. The boost compression train works recirculating a portion\nof gas to V-B02 (B29). Then, the gas coming from V-B01 is regulated\nthrough valve L-C01 and mixed with the boosted gas (C10).\n\n3.2.1.3 Gas injection/export system\n\nThe gas stream coming from boost subsystem (B17) is directed\nto the gas injection system (GAS INJ.), where the gas is compressed\nand dehydrated in order to meet the requirements to be injected back\nto the reservoir or sent to onshore facilities via pipeline. A simplified\nscheme of operation is shown in Fig. 20, a more detailed scheme is\npresented in Appendix A.\n\nIn a similar manner to the boost subsystem, the gas injection\ntrain consists of four compression stages (C-D01/C-D02/C-D03/C-D04),\neach one accomplished with a gas cooling (air coolers F-D01/F-D02/F-\nD03/F-D04 respectively) and the subsequent separation of condensates,\nwhich are returned back to the previous stage (streams B27, D12, D13\nand D15 respectively). Before the fourth stage, the dehydration sub-\nsystem (DEH) removes the humidity from the gas stream using TEG\n(triethylene glycol) as absorbent. Fuel gas (stream B18) used in power\ngeneration subsystem (POWER) is derived from the dehydrated gas\n\n\n\n45\n\nFigure 20 \u2013 Basic PFD (Process Flow Diagram) of the gas injection/-\nexport system.\n\nstream (D24). This stream is regulated by the valve L-D01 according\nto the fuel demand of the gas turbines. A portion of the compressed\ngas is recirculated to the compression train suction (stream D19), in or-\nder to maintain the necessary operating parameters of the equipment.\nThe compressed gas (stream GAS) is then injected into the reservoir\nor exported via pipeline.\n\n3.2.1.4 Power generation system\n\nThe required energy for the operation of the plant is supplied\nby the power generation system, which is formed by two gas turbines\nSiemens SGT-400 operating at part load. Figure 21 shows the working\nscheme of these turbines. The power cycle was modeled as two com-\npression stages and a third stage supplying the power to the plant. The\noperating parameters were adjusted according to the curves provided\nby supplier (SIEMENS AG, 2009), as shown in Fig. 22.\n\nThe maximum output per turbine was limited to 11 MW, such\nthat when the demand of the plant does not exceed this value, only one\n\n\n\n46\n\nFigure 21 \u2013 Basic PFD (Process Flow Diagram) of the power generation\nsystem.\n\nturbine is considered in operation. Consequently, when the demanded\npower in plant exceeds 11 MW, the second turbine enters in operation\nsharing the 50% of the total load.\n\n3.2.1.5 Seawater injection system\n\nOn the other side, in order to promote the oil recovery from the\nreservoir, the analyzed FPSO has a seawater treatment and injection\nsystem that is outlined in Fig. 23. A part of the injected water is recir-\nculated to the pump suction to guarantee the minimum flow necessary\nfor the secure operation of the equipment.\n\nBased on the results of previous works (NGUYEN et al., 2012, 2013;\nVOLDSUND et al., 2010), the following process subsystems were neglected\nin the plant model, due to their small energy demand when compared\nto the main operations described above:\n\n\u2022 Gas dehydration system.\n\n\u2022 Production water treatment.\n\n\u2022 Seawater treatment.\n\n\n\n47\n\nFigure 22 \u2013 Operating parameters of gas turbines (SIEMENS AG, 2009).\n\nFigure 23 \u2013 Basic PFD (Process Flow Diagram) of the water injection\nsystem.\n\n\n\n48\n\n3.2.2 Input data\n\nTables 2 through 6 presents the main operation parameters of\neach subsystem in the plant.

The corresponding value is 36,05 MJ/kg.\n\n3.2.3 EES case\n\nAppendix C presents the model developed in EES. As mentioned\nabove, its conception was simpler than the model done using Hysys (de-\nscribed in this section). The comparison of results using both models\ncan be used to examine the influence of the detailing level in the cal-\nculation of the exergy efficiency of the plant.\n\n3.2.4 Production parameters profiles\n\nWith the aim of analyzing the influence of the main production\nvariables over the impact of an integrated ORC in the studied FPSO,\ndifferent profiles were proposed. As shown in Fig. 24, these profiles\nwere developed in 16 scenarios such that each variable could be ana-\nlyzed separately. As mentioned above, the chosen variables were: (i)\noil flow varying from 800 up to 9000 standard m3/d, (ii) Gas flow vary-\ning from 1.5 up to 2 million of Nm3/d, (iii) production water flow,\nvarying from 200 up to 4000 standard m3/d, (iv) seawater flow varying\nfrom 12000 up to 18000 standard m3/d and (v) well pressure varying\nfrom 3000 down to 1500 kPa. As stated earlier, the standard condi-\ntions for liquid volumetric flow are referred to T=15?C and P=101.325\nkPa. Similarly, the gas volumetric flow (Nm3/d) is referred at normal\nconditions (T=0?C and P=101.325 kPa).\n\n3.3 EXERGY ANALYSIS\n\n3.3.1 Exergy calculation\n\nAs previously mentioned, the formulation adopted for the calcu-\nlation of total exergy of the material streams within the process corre-\nsponds to that proposed by Hinderink et al. (1996). The specific exergy\nof a multicomponent stream (b) is expressed as shown in Eq. 3.9.\n\nb = bchem + bphys + ?mixb (3.9)\n\nwhere bchem , bphys and ?mixb correspond to the specific chem-\n\n\n\n52\n\nFigure 24 \u2013 Analized production profiles.\n\nical exergy, the specific physical exergy and the mixing exergy respec-\ntively. Eq. 3.8 is used for the calculation of bchem, as explained in\nSec. 3.1.2. By other side, the Eq. 3.10 is used for the calculation of\nbphys, as explained by Szargut, Morris e Steward (1988).\n\nbphys = ?h ? T0 ?s (3.10)\n\nwhere ?h = h ? ho and ?s = s ? so, considering h and s as\nthe current specific enthalpy and the specific entropy of the stream\nrespectively. On the other hand, ho and so correspond to the specific\nenthalpy and specific entropy of the stream evaluated at dead state\nconditions, which were defined at T0 = 25\n\n?C and P0 = 101.325 kPa.\n\n\n\n53\n\nAppendix B shows the code developed for implementing the calculation\nof the physical exergy of a material stream using Hysys. This code was\ndeveloped based on the work of Abdollahi-Demneh et al. (2011).\n\nEq. 3.11 presents the calculation of ?mixb, which represents the\nexergy destroyed due to the entropy generation during a non-ideal mix-\ning process at isothermal and isobaric conditions. This term is com-\nmonly negative and its use permits to isolate the net effect of a sepa-\nration process over the exergy flow associated with a multicomponent\nstream (HINDERINK et al., 1996).\n\n?mixb = ?mixh ? T0 ?mixs (3.11)\n\nconsidering ?mixh = h\nm ?\n\n?\nxi hi and ?mixs = s\n\nm ?\n?\nxi si,\n\nwhere hm and sm correspond to the molar enthalpy and the molar\nentropy of the mixture respectively. hi and si are the molar enthalpy\nand the molar entropy of the component i at the same conditions of\nthe mixture respectively. Appendix B shows the code integrated to\nHysys for implementing the calculation of the mixing exergy of each\nmaterial stream. Adopting this procedure, Eq. 3.9 for calculation of\nthe total exergy of a multicomponent stream is reformulated as shown\nin Eq. 3.12.\n\nb =\n?\n\nxi bchem,i + ((h ? ho) ? T0 (s ? so))\n\n+\n((\nhm ?\n\n?\nxi hi\n\n)\n? T0\n\n(\nsm ?\n\n?\nxi si\n\n))\n(3.12)\n\n3.3.2 Plant exergy balances\n\nAppendix D presents the formulation of the exergy balance for\neach equipment conforming the plant. Exergy losses (BL) are associ-\nated with those material and energy streams that are not part of the\ndesired product of the plant/subsystem. Conversely, destroyed exergy\n(BD) is associated with the entropy generation (irreversibility) present\nin each process. Eq. 3.13 presents the relation between the destruction\nof exergy and the entropy generated during a non-reversible operation\n(CENGEL; BOLES, 2010). Given that Hysys calculates the entropy of\nthe material streams directly according to the chosen thermodynamic\npackage and by other side the implementation of the exergy calculation\nmust be done through a programing block, this expression can be useful\n\n\n\n54\n\nto check the consistency of obtained data. Values of BD obtained from\nthe exergy balance of each equipment must match with that calculated\nusing the entropy values reported by Hysys.\n\nBD = T0 \u00b7 Sgen (3.13)\n\nwhere\n\nSgen = (Sout ? Sin) ?\n? Q\n\nT\n\n3.3.3 Exergy and energy efficiency indicators\n\n3.3.3.1 Overall indicators\n\nGiven the scheme of operation of the whole plant shown in\nFig. 18, the desired effects of the process can be divided in the fol-\nlowing items:\n\n\u2022 Remove water and gas incorporated together with the oil in the\ninlet fluid stream.\n\n\u2022 Compress the gas stream for further use.\n\n\u2022 Pump the seawater to be injected into the reservoir.\n\nAs it can be inferred from previous works (HINDERINK et al.,\n1996; SILVA et al., 2012), the decrease of the mixing term in Eq. 3.9 also\nrepresents a chemical exergy increment when conceived as (RIVERO;\nRENDON; MONROY, 1999). This increase of exergy constitutes the main\neffect (product) of separation process when considering a mixture and\nits components at equilibrium (SILVA, 2008).\n\nAdopting the concept presented by Bejan (1996), the exergy as-\nsociated with the entire product (or effect) of the plant (BP ) was ex-\npressed by the sum of the exergy effects related to the above-mentioned\nitems, as shown in Eq. 3.14.\n\nBP = ?Bmix + ?Bphys,GAS + ?Bphys,SEA (3.14)\n\nconsidering\n\n?Bmix = ?mixBF LUID ? (?mixBOIL + ?mixBGAS)\n\n\n\n55\n\nwhere ?mixBi = mi ?mixbi is the exergy of mixing of stream i\n(i.e. streams named FLUID, OIL and GAS in the model scheme \u2013see\nFig. 18); here mi corresponds to its mass flow. Analogously,\n\n?Bphys,GAS =mGAS bphys,GAS ? (mB11 bphys,B11\n+ mB12 bphys,B12 + mB14 bphys,B14)\n\n?Bphys,SEA =mH02 \u00b7 bphys,H02 ? mH01 \u00b7 bphys,H01\n\nConsidering that a great extent of the exergy contained in the\nstreams of interest (i.e. oil, gas and injected water streams) are supplied\ninitially with the inlet streams, the consumed exergy BF was expressed\nas the sum of BP and the difference between the exergy associated with\ninlet streams (Bin) and the exergy associated with product streams\n(BP S). Eq. 3.15 presents the exergy indicator chosen to evaluate the\nperformance of the plant.\n\n?II =\nBP\nBF\n\n(3.15)\n\nconsidering BF = BP + (Bin ? BP S) and\n\nBin = BF LUID + BAIR + BH01\n\nBP S = BOIL + BGAS + BH02\n\nAs mentioned in previous works (SILVA et al., 2012; SILVA, 2008),\nanother exergy indicator that can be used for this kind of processes is\nthe degree of perfection ?P . This index was defined by Szargut, Morris e\nSteward (1988) and relates the exergy of the products of interest leaving\nthe system (BP S) and the inlet exergy (Bin) as shown in Eq. 3.16.\n\n?P =\nBP S\nBin\n\n(3.16)\n\nAlternatively, with the aim to demonstrate the energy efficiency in\nterms that can be associated with production variables, this study\npropose the indicator ? that represents the energy consumption per\nstandard cubic meter of exported oil. This indicator is presented in\nEq. 3.17. It can be easily converted to fuel gas consumption or to\nenergy consumption expressed in BOE (barrels of oil equivalent1) per\nvolumetric unit of produced oil.\n\n1The BOE is a unit of energy based on the approximate energy released by\nburning one barrel of crude oil and it is equivalent to about 1.7 MWh.\n\n\n\n56\n\n? =\nmB18 \u00b7 LHVB18\n\nvOIL\n(3.17)\n\nwhere vOIL corresponds to the standard volumetric flow of pro-\nduced oil in m3/s.\n\n3.3.3.2 Subsystems indicators\n\nAnalogously, BP,i was defined for each subsystem i in order to\nobtain the exergy indicators ?p,i and ?i associated with each process.\nAs shown in Eq. 3.18, ?i corresponds to the second law efficiency (?II,i)\nbut formulated using the irreversibility (BD,i) and the exergy losses\n(BL,i) calculated for each process. In that way, Tab. 10 shows the\nformulation of BP,i for each subsystem. Evidently, the value of ? for\nthe entire plant must be equal to ?II (explained in the previous section)\nto be coherent with the definition presented by Bejan (1996).\n\n?i =\nBP,i\n\nBP,i + BL,i + BD,i\n(3.18)\n\nhere BF,i = BP,i + BL,i + BD,i.\n\n3.4 ORC MODELING\n\n3.4.1 fluid selection\n\nAs explained in Sec. 2.3.2, numerous works had analyzed differ-\nent ORC working fluids candidates with the purpose of determining\nthe best candidate taking into account different fluid characteristics as\nthe slope of the vapor saturation curve, critical properties, enthalpy\nof vaporization, density, specific heat and others related to environ-\nmental aspects as ODP (ozone depletion potential) or GWP (global\nwarming potential)(CHEN; GOSWAMI; STEFANAKOS, 2010; BAO; ZHAO,\n2013). This work is focused on the use of cyclopentane as working\nfluid based on the results of a recent study (PIEROBON et al., 2013),\nwhere cyclopentane was indicated as the best option when accounting\nthe ORC power output and the size of ORC equipment as choosing\ncriteria. Despite its flammable and toxicological characteristics, it is\nimportant to remark that the plant already deals with this type of\nsubstances (i.e. hydrocarbons) in its main processes and it would be\n\n\n\n57\n\nTable 10 \u2013 Subsystems exergy product definition.\n\nSystem Streams\n\nSeparation plant i j\n\nBP =\n?\ni\n\n?mixBi ?\n?\nj\n\n?mixBj\n\nOIL FLUID\nB11 A07a\nB13 A07b\nB15 B18\n\nB20a B26\nB20b B27\n\nB29\n\nGas turbines i?\ni\n\nWi WT-A03a\n\nWT-A03b\n\nGas boost system i j k m\n\nBP =\n?\ni\n\nBphys,i ?\n?\nj\n\nBphys,j\n\n+\n?\nk\n\n?mixBk ?\n?\nm\n\n?mixBm\n\nC10 B13 B16 B11\nB29 B15 B29 B13\n\nB15\n\nGas injection system i j\n\nBP =\n?\ni\n\n?mixBi + Bphys,i ?\n?\nj\n\n?mixBj + Bphys,j GAS B17\nB18\n\nSeawater injection system i j\n\nBP =\n?\ni\n\nBphys,i ?\n?\nj\n\nBphys,j H02 H01\n\nORC system i\n\nWi WT-F01\n\n\n\n58\n\nnot necessary to make important modifications due to safety issues.\nTable 11 summarizes the main properties of this substance.\n\nTable 11 \u2013 Main physical properties of the cyclopentane\n\nProperty Units Value\n\nMolecular wt. 70.14\nCritical temperature ?C 234\nCritical pressure kPa 4506\n?

Since this slope is positive (as seen in Tab. 11), the expansion\nprocess (F10 \u2013 F11 in Fig. 10 \u2013 Sec. 2.3) results in an overheated vapor\nstream at the turbine outlet. This means that the incorporation of an\nintermediate regenerator (E-F04) is convenient in order to take some\nadvantage of the remaining energy associated with this stream.\n\nIt can be noted that superheating of vapor at turbine inlet (E-\nF01) is not necessary theoretically. However, this study contemplates a\nslight superheating of vapor in order to avoid any condensation at the\nturbine intake.\n\n3.4.3 Integration with plant model and parameters of opera-\ntion\n\nIn accordance with previous works focused on the exergy anal-\nysis of oil and gas production platforms, the most appropriate use of\nORC systems in these installations consist in recovering exergy from the\nexhaust gases coming from gas turbines or from processes associated\nwith combustion (PIEROBON; NGUYEN, 2012a; NGUYEN et al., 2013).\nConsidering the operation scheme of the analyzed FPSO, this study\nproposes the integration of the ORC within the existing HTF circuit,\n\n\n\n59\n\nin order to take some advantage and reduce the number of modifica-\ntions to the operating scheme of existing installations. The ORC was\nlocated downstream of exchanger E-B02 (HTF side) at the valve L-E01\nposition.\n\nEvidently, when the ORC is integrated within the model, a re-\nlationship is established between the amount of energy taken from ex-\nhaust gases, the HTF mass flow rate, HTF temperature levels and the\nORC system performance. This correlation makes necessary to update\ntheir corresponding values in order to take an acceptable advantage.\nLikewise, the internal parameters of the ORC that influence directly its\noutput (e.g. evaporation temperature, working fluid mass flow, tem-\nperature of condensation, etc.) must be adjusted properly according\nto established criteria. In that way, Tab. 12 presents the assumptions\nused in this paper for the variables affecting the ORC performance.\n\nTable 12 \u2013 ORC parameters and assumptions\n\nParameter Units Value\n\nCondensation pressure kPa 110\nHTF maximum temperature ?C 300\nRegenerator pinch point ?C 5\nSuperheating ?C 1\nExpander adiabatic efficiency % 65\nPump adiabatic efficiency % 75\nEconomizer pinch point ?C 5\nHeat exchangers ?P (tubeside) kPa 50\nHeat exchangers ?P (shellside) kPa 25\n\nParticularly, the evaporation temperature of cyclopentane within\nthe cycle was analyzed varying it from an established minimum tem-\nperature (180 ?C) up to its critical temperature. This was done with\nthe aim of finding an appropriate evaporation temperature at which\nthe flow rate and rejected heat were reduced in each scenario.\n\nConsidering a centralized power distribution (i.e. all the power\ndemand of the plant is supplied by only one power distribution sys-\ntem), the power generated by the ORC was subtracted from the total\npower demand and the remainder was supplied by existing turbines.\nThese assumptions together with the turbines operation configure the\ncalculation algorithm for each scenario, as presented in Fig. 25.

Despite its importance for obtaining accurate results, this infor-\nmation was compiled in a separate section because it is not considered\nas a fundamental part within the aims of the present work.\n\n4.2 MODEL DEVELOPMENT\n\nThe mass and energy balances of the plant enable the quantifi-\ncation of the power requirements as well as the heat rejected in each\noperation involved in the process. Although currently there are no data\navailable from field to corroborate the model, the comparison with the\nresults of previous studies can give an idea about the size of the plant\nand the consistency of the model. Particularly, the platform analyzed\nby Nguyen et al. (2012) has a similar configuration to that studied in\nthis work. Table 13 presents some results for both models developed\n(using Hysys and EES) together with the results obtained from this\nreference. As stated above, the great variability of the well fluid prop-\nerties and production characteristics from field to another make each\ninstallation unique and this fact makes difficult the validation of the\nresults of a plant model with the data from another.\n\nBy the other hand, the power consumption breakdown (pre-\nsented in Tab. 14), indicates how the energy is distributed among the\nsubsystems and the load of each one within the entire system. Particu-\nlarly, the injection operations (i.e. gas and seawater) presented a value\nfar above from that reported to the separation plant. In general, the\nresults obtained using EES were appreciably smaller than those using\nHysys, except for the gas boosting where the gas compressed had a\nlower molecular weight in the EES case. The power distribution (as\npercentages) is presented in Tab. 15, which is practically in accordance\nwith those reported by Nguyen et al. (2012). Analogously, Fig. 26 ex-\nhibits the results obtained by both models. Considering the differences\nabout the size of the plants, the proportion and the conditions of the\noil, gas and water flows as well as the subsystems considered in the\nmodels, the results obtained here are noticeably in line with the model\ndeveloped for the platform located at North Sea.\n\n\n\n64\n\nTable 13 \u2013 Comparison of mass and energy balances of models.\n\nParameter Nguyen, 2012 This work\n\nEES Hysys\n\nPlatform localization North Sea Brazil Brazil\nConsidered Operations\nProduction manifolds yes no yes\nCrude oil separation yes yes yes\nOil pumping and export yes yes yes\nOil heating by furnace no no no\nGas re-compression (boost) yes yes yes\nGas dehydration yes no no\nGas injection/exportation yes yes yes\nWastewater treatment yes no no\nSeawater injection yes yes yes\nPower generation yes yes yes\nRecycling streams yes no yes\n\nSize of the plant\nOil produced, sm3/h 156-457 375 75-375\nGas produced, 103\u00b7Nm3/h 190-320 63.5 62.5-87.5\nWater produced, sm3/h 50-123 158.3 8.3-158.3\nSeawater injected, sm3/h 900-2900 500 500-750\nSeawater inj.

As\ncan be seen in Tab. 16, the power generation system is responsible for\nover the half of the total heat rejection in the plant (see also Fig. 27).\nHere, the largest heat discharge to the atmosphere corresponds to the\nexhaust gas stream, which has a calculated temperature of 471 ?C. It\ncan be inferred that this heat source is the most suitable to activate\nthe ORC.\n\nTable 16 \u2013 Rejected heat per subsystem, kW.\n\nSystem\n\nEES Hysys\n\nValue % Value %\n\nSeparation plant 2994 7.90 3029 7.61\nGas turbines* 25066 66.12 22656 56.94\nGas boost system 436 1.15 694 1.74\nGas injection 9412 24.83 13407 33.70\nSeawater injection 0 0.00 0 0.00\n\nTotal 37909 39786\n\n*With a min. allowed temp. of 150 ?C for exhaust gases.\n\nFigure 27 \u2013 Rejected heat distribution for: (a)-Hysys model and (b)-\nEES model.\n\nDetailed results of mass and energy balances (accounting for each\n\n\n\n67\n\nequipment separately) are presented in Appendix C. Examining these\nresults for the Hysys case, a minor imbalance of 22 kg/h was identified\nwithin the power generation system. This imbalance was caused by\nthe omission of the traces of pseudocomponents in the fuel gas stream,\nwith the aim to enable the calculation sequence of the Gibbs reactors\nsimulating the combustor chambers of the turbines. Since the data\nof the Gibbs energy of formation (?fG\n\n?) of the pseudocomponents\nare unknown, the internal algorithm of calculation does not attain a\nminimum Gibbs free energy for the combustion reaction (?rG\n\n?) and\nthe composition of the products cannot be determined. Given that\nthe amount of pseudocomponents in the fuel gas is negligible (most of\nthem have a high molecular weight) and according to Hinderink et al.\n(1996) the estimation of their ?fG\n\n? may result in an inconsistent set\nof standard chemical exergies, their mass fractions were approximated\nto 0. Future work should include an appropriate procedure to estimate\nthe ?rG\n\n? of a hydrocarbon pseudocomponent combustion adequately.\n\n4.3 EXERGY ANALYSIS\n\n4.3.1 Exergy balance\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the exergy balance of the plant enables\nthe recognition of the processes with greatest exergy destruction as\nwell as the quantification of the losses discharged to the atmosphere.\nBy means of this analysis, it is possible to establish the reference case\nand the parameters of comparison in order to demonstrate the effect\nof the ORC system along the proposed production profile. In a similar\nway to mass and energy balances, Tab. 17 and Tab. 18 presents the\nresults of the exergy balances obtained using Hysys and EES. Given\nthat the existing WHR system recovers part of the energy associated to\nexhaust gases and is considered part of the separation plant, the exergy\nlosses associated with this stream are not accounted for in the power\ngeneration system, but in the separation plant. Detailed results (bal-\nances per equipment) are presented in Appendix D. Due to the mass\nflow imbalance previously discussed for the power generation system, a\ndifference of 271 kW was identified in its exergy balance. Considering\nthe magnitude of the involved flows and the high specific exergy value\nof the fuel gas stream, this value represents a minor deficit in the exergy\ncalculations and is not significant for the analysis of the performance\nof the plant.\n\n\n\n68\n\nTable 17 \u2013 Exergy losses per subsystem, kW.\n\nSystem Value\n\nEES Hysys\n\nSeparation plant 20062.8 16968.2\nGas turbines 1006.3 758.3\nGas boost 83.4 104.2\nGas injection 1590.3 1981.2\n\nTotal 22742.7 19811.9\n\nLikewise the results obtained by Nguyen et al. (2012), the great-\nest exergy losses are associated with the exhaust gases coming from gas\nturbines. Similarly, when the combustor chambers in the power gen-\neration subsystem are not considered, the largest exergy destruction\ntakes place in separation plant (mainly caused by pressure reduction\nin manifold) and in the gas injection compressors. This observation is\nin accordance with the previous analysis carried out by Nguyen et al.\n(2013) and Voldsund et al. (2010) for fixed platforms in North Sea.\n\nTable 18 \u2013 Exergy destruction rate per subsystem, kW.\n\nSystem Value\n\nEES Hysys\n\nSeparation plant 2064.5 3879.9\nGas turbines 17345.6 19795.1\nGas boost system 95.2 309.6\nGas injection system 2713.3 3592.6\nSeawater injection system 933.4 1313.8\n\nTotal 23152.0 28891.1\n\nThe Sankey diagram is a graphical representation of any type of\nflow or transfers (e.g. material, energy, exergy, emissions, costs, etc.)\nthrough a series of processes, in which the width of the arrows is shown\nproportionally to the flow quantity. In this case, this diagram is used\nto visualize the relation between the exergy flows within the plant and\nthe proportion of their magnitudes (commonly called Grassmann dia-\ngram when refers to exergy flows). From the Grassmann diagram for\nthe Hysys case displayed in Fig. 28 it can be seen that the exergy bal-\n\n\n\n69\n\nance is largely dominated by exergy associated with the oil and gas\nstreams when compared with the others associated with their process-\ning. This behavior is related with the high specific chemical exergy\nassociated with these streams. Given that any improvement in the en-\nergy efficiency of the plant would modify the rest of the streams, it\nappears that the shape and the proportion of this diagram are unlikely\nto change. Subsequently, it is reasonable that an exergy performance\nindicator for this type of installations were process-oriented and rep-\nresents how far a process is from ideality. In that way, exergy flows\nshould not be considered entirely as exergy products or fuels in order\nto avoid values too high or too low for performance indicators.\n\nFigure 28 \u2013 Simplified Grassmann diagram of the plant, exergy flows\nin MW.\n\nAnalogously to the energy balances of the plant, the individual\ncontribution of each system in the total exergy destruction of the plant\ncan be calculated using the Eq. 4.1 and can serve for comparison with\nprevious studies. In that way, Tab. 19 presents the corresponding data\nof the present work together with those reported by Nguyen et al.\n\n\n\n70\n\n(2012). Distributions of the destroyed exergy and exergy losses for both\nmodels are exhibited in Figs. 29 and 30 respectively. Additionally, data\nobtained considering only the separation plant, the gas boosting and\nthe gas injection were compared with those reported by Voldsund et al.\n(2010) (see Tab. 20). The exergy destruction sharing displayed values\nvery close to the data obtained by the first reference, especially for the\ncase developed in Hysys. However, in the second comparison the values\nshown a considerable discrepancy with the data published. This can be\nassociated with the great difference between the operation conditions\nand the fact that the inlet manifold (where a sudden expansion of well\nfluid occurs) is not considered by the author. By other side, concerning\nthe exergy losses that take place in the plant (see Tab. 21), results\nsuggest that the exergy losses sharing is associated directly with the\nproduction parameters of the plant.\n\nyD,i =\nBD,i?\nBD,i\n\nyL,i =\nBL,i?\nBL,i\n\n(4.1)\n\nTable 19 \u2013 Exergy destruction rate distribution.\n\nSystem yD,i This work\n\nNguyen, 2012 EES Hysys\n\nSeparation plant 0.16-0.18 0.089 0.134\nGas turbines 0.65-0.68 0.749 0.685\nGas boost system 0.033-0.042 0.004 0.011\nGas injection system 0.076-0.101 0.117 0.124\nSeawater injection system 0.03-0.035 0.040 0.045\n\nTable 20 \u2013 Exergy destruction rate distribution (only separation and\ngas processes).\n\nSystem yD,i This work\n\nVoldsund, 2010 EES Hysys\n\nSeparation plant 0.23 0.424 0.499\nGas boost system 0.11 0.020 0.040\nGas injection system 0.66 0.557 0.462\n\n\n\n71\n\nFigure 29 \u2013 Exergy destruction rate distribution for: (a)-Hysys model\nand (b)-EES model.\n\nFigure 30 \u2013 Exergy losses distribution for: (a)-Hysys model and (b)-\nEES model.\n\n\n\n72\n\nTable 21 \u2013 Exergy losses distribution.\n\nSystem yL,i This work\n\nNguyen, 2012 EES Hysys\n\nExhaust gases 0.914 0.796 0.743\nCooling water 0.065 0.091 0.126\nFlared gases 0.012 0.000 0.000\nProduction water 0.009 0.113 0.131\n\n4.3.2 Exergy performance\n\nFrom the definition of the exergy performance indicators pre-\nsented in Sec. 3.3.3.2, it is possible to demonstrate how the consumed\nexergy is effectively transferred to obtain the desired effect (or prod-\nucts) of the plant. Tabs. 22 and 23 summarize the data related to the\nexergy performance obtained from models developed using Hysys and\nEES respectively. Particularly, the formulation presented in Eq. 4.2 was\napplied to the exergy balance obtained with the EES model in order to\nobtain comparable data. Despite compositional changes were not taken\ninto account, there is a change in the mixing term due to the phase sep-\naration. As pointed by Silva et al. (2012), this term corresponds to the\nmain product of separation processes.\n\n?mixBj = nj\n\n(\nR T0\n\n?\nzi ln (zi \u00b7 ?i)\n\n)\n(4.2)\n\nwhere nj corresponds to the molar flow of stream j in kmol/s\nand ?i (i.e. activity coefficient of component i) were approximated to\n1. ?mixBj is given in kJ/s.\n\nFigures 31 and 32 display the exergy efficiencies (?p and ? re-\nspectively) for each subsystem obtained by both models. Regarding\nthe degree of thermodynamic of perfection, the system with the worst\nperformance within the processing plant (i.e. without considering the\ncombustor chambers) corresponds to the seawater injection system fol-\nlowed by the gas injection for both models. This behavior is related\nto the proportion between the outlet exergy and the unused exergy\n(i.e. losses or destruction) by the operation; the lower the outlet ex-\nergy magnitude, worse the exergy performance is. Thus, for processes\nwith outlets with high exergy content (e.g. gas streams) an amount of\nunused exergy does not have a significant impact over ?p. While pro-\n\n\n\n73\n\nTable 22 \u2013 Exergy performance indicators by system - Hysys model.\n\nSystem ?p ?\n\nSeparation plant 0.9957 0.008\nGas turbines 0.2808 0.281\nGas boost system 0.9957 0.030\nGas injection system 0.9919 0.403\nSeawater injection system 0.8857 0.553\n\nWhole plant 0.9897 0.124\n\nTable 23 \u2013 Exergy performance indicators - EES model\n\nSystem ?p ?\n\nSeparation plant 0.9953 0.004\nGas turbines 0.2563 0.256\nGas boost system 0.9958 0.504\nGas injection system 0.9943 0.517\nSeawater injection system 0.9120 0.747\n\nWhole plant 0.9901 0.137\n\ncesses with products with relatively low exergy content (e.g. seawater\nstreams) have a ?p more sensible to their unused exergy.\n\nBy other side, considering the exergy indicator ? for each subsys-\ntem within the processing plant, the separation plant appears with the\nlowest exergy performance. This is related with the exergy-dissipative\noperations (i.e. pressure reduction, mixing and recirculation) that\ndominate the separation plant. Analogously, it can be inferred that\nthe discrepancies between the values reported by the models are as-\nsociated with the recirculation modeling. While in EES model these\nstreams were not considered, in Hysys were considered as exergy losses\nfor each specific operation.\n\nParticularly for the gas turbines, the value of ?p equals the ?\nvalue. This is related to the power produced by this system and the\nperformance reported for the equipment. The difference between the\nreported values from both models corresponds to the operation point\nof turbines. While the power required by the plant in EES was 12.97\nMW, the power requirement in Hysys was 14.57 MW.\n\nRegarding the overall exergy performance, the results were con-\nsistent for both models. EES reports higher performance indicators,\n\n\n\n74\n\nFigure 31 \u2013 Exergy efficiencies (?p) for Hysys and EES models.\n\nFigure 32 \u2013 Exergy efficiencies (?p) for Hysys and EES models.\n\n\n\n75\n\nprobably associated with the calculation of the specific chemical ex-\nergy of the oil streams for ?p and with the calculation of mixing exergy\nfor ?. In the first case, the sum of component contributions to obtain\nbch,oil (Hysys case) was greater than the calculation of this considering\nthe oil as a unique substance (EES case). Consequently, this affects\ndirectly the ratio between the outlet exergy and unused exergy (thus\n?p). By other side, considering that the oily and aqueous phases were\ntreated as pure substances in EES (i.e. ?mixBj = 0), the mixing term\ndifference between products and inlets was greater than that reported\nusing Hysys.\n\n4.4 ORC COUPLED TO THE PLANT\n\nThere are multiple considerations and variables to define in order\nto model adequately the operation of the ORC and its incorporation to\nan existing system. Given the extensive literature dedicated to explore\nthe performance of this system and the focus of this work, the ORC\nmodeled to be included into the studied plant was defined based on pre-\nvious studies that indicate cyclopentane as the best choice when there\nis a comprise between performance, compactness and economic revenue\n(PIEROBON et al., 2013; LAI; WENDLAND; FISCHER, 2011). However, the\nintegration of the cycle still has various degrees of freedom to adjust its\nservice within the plant. As can be deduced from the information pre-\nsented in Sec. 3.4.3, following criteria were applied in the Hysys model\nwith the purpose of reducing conveniently the number of degrees of\nfreedom when calculating the performance of the integrated ORC.\n\n\u2022 The maximum HTF temperature was set to 300?C (stream E07).\n\n\u2022 The mass flow of HTF is calculated to meet a pinch point of 10?C\nin the heat exchanger E-E01.\n\n\u2022 The ORC working fluid flow and HTF outlet temperature (stream\nE02) are updated to meet the pinch point restrictions of the heat\nexchangers within the ORC system.\n\n\u2022 A superheating of 1?C was set at E-F01 (ORC subsystem).\n\n\u2022 A pinch point of 5?C was set for the regenerator E-F04.\n\n\u2022 The evaporator pinch point is updated to meet a minimum ap-\nproach of 5 ?C between the cyclopentane temperature profile and\nthe HTF temperature profile.\n\n\n\n76\n\n\u2022 The ORC output is subtracted from total plant demand, and the\noperation conditions of gas turbines are updated according to this\nvalue.\n\nWith the adoption of these criteria, the ORC system is modeled\ncompletely defining only the evaporation temperature at E-F02. In\nthat way, a set of 20 temperatures ranging from 180?C up to 235.5?C\nwere run in order to examine the behavior of the energy and exergy\nparameters of the cycle and choose a convenient evaporation temper-\nature. As it can be seen in Fig. 33, the examined parameters were:\n(i) cyclopentane mass flow, (ii) ORC exergy performance, (iii) Total\nrejected heat and (iv) ORC output.\n\nFigure 33 \u2013 Variation of (i) cyclopentane mass flow, (ii) ORC perfor-\nmance, (iii) Rejected heat and (iv) ORC output with the evaporation\ntemperature of cyclopentane.\n\n\n\n77\n\nAn inspection of the figures on the left side indicates a local min-\nimum of the working fluid mass flow and the plant rejected heat in the\nproximity of its critical point (226.8?C). Conversely, the performance\nand the output of the cycle demonstrate a continuous increase with the\nevaporation temperature (Tev). This behavior apparently refutes the\nresults obtained by Declaye (2009) described previously in Sec. 2.3.2.2.\nHowever, as explained by Invernizzi, Iora e Silva (2007), when the criti-\ncal temperature (Tc) of the working fluid is lower than that of the heat\nsource (as in this case), the resulting optimum Tev is very close to its\nTc. On the contrary, if Tc is higher than the maximum temperature\nof the heat source (as ketone in the example earlier shown), optimum\nTev should be determined in order to maximize the ORC output.\n\nIn order to investigate the behavior of the curves shown previ-\nously, an examination of the ORC operation conditions and the HTF\noutlet temperature was carried out. An inspection of Fig. 34 indicates\na local maximum of HTF outlet temperature (TE02) close to the Tev\nwhere the heat rejected by the plant reported a minimum.\n\nFigure 34 \u2013 Variation of the HTF outlet temperature and HTF mass\nflow with the evaporation temperature of cyclopentane.\n\n\n\n78\n\nAnalogously, operation conditions of the cycle using the mini-\nmum and the maximum evaporation temperatures (180?C and 235.6?C\nrespectively) were compared with those calculated with a Tev = 226.8\n\n?C\nin the T-s diagram. As can be seen from Fig. 35(i), the higher the Tev,\nthe larger the ?P in the expander and the higher the temperature of\nthe expander outlet (stream F11). Consequently, there is an increment\nof the ORC output (see Fig. 33(iv)) with the simultaneous reduction\nof its heat input, inherent to the load reduction in gas turbines (see\nFig. 36). As the heat input decreases, the working fluid mass flow\nshould be reduced to meet the energy balance of the cycle compo-\nnents with the established constraints (see Fig. 33(i)). As illustrated in\nFig. 36, the increase of ORC output simultaneously with the decrease\nof the cyclopentane mass flow implies a rise in its specific work.\n\nFigure 35 \u2013 T-s diagram of the ORC at different evaporation tempera-\ntures.\n\nTaking into account the temperature rise at the expander outlet,\nthe heat capacity flows and the PPD constraints for E-F03 (economizer)\nand E-F04 (regenerator), an increase of Tev results in an increase of\nTE02. As this temperature increases, the HTF temperature difference\nat E-E01 decreases and its circulating mass flow should be increased in\norder to meet the energy balance of the equipment with its specified\nPPD.\n\nBy other side, the behavior of the results suggests that there is a\nmaximum TE02 (see Figs 34 and 35(ii)) reported at a Tev in the prox-\n\n\n\n79\n\nFigure 36 \u2013 Variation of ORC input and cyclopentane specific work\nwith the evaporation temperature.\n\nimity of 226.8?C in which the cyclopentane mass flow and the rejected\nheat display a minimum value (see Fig 33(i)-(iii)). It could be inferred\nthat the location of this point is influenced by the performance of the\ncycle together with the gas turbines operation, which is determined by\nthe whole plant demand.\n\nIn this way, the ORC working Tev was set at the temperature\nthat reports the minimum mass flow and rejected heat among the 20\nanalyzed temperatures (from 180?C up to 235.6 ?C) in each analized\nscenario. For this case a Tev of 226.8\n\n?C was set for the ORC system,\nwhich reports an output of 3.48 MW.\n\nWith the aim of showing the effect that the ORC has over the op-\neration of the plant, a comparison of some key parameters is presented\nin Tab. 24. In general, the inclusion of the ORC within the plant has\na positive impact over its performance. The improvement of thermal\nefficiency of the power generation and the reduction of the heat rejec-\ntion of the plant were remarkable, although fuel savings and reduction\nof CO2 emissions are the most interesting improvements environmen-\ntally and economically speaking. Concerning the exergy performance\n\n\n\n80\n\nindicators, the operation of the ORC system has a greater impact over\nthe chosen ?II , which would be the most appropriate to demonstrate\nits influence over the plant performance.\n\nTable 24 \u2013 Effect of the ORC integration over some production param-\neters of the plant\n\nParameter Base Base +ORC % Diff.\n\nPower demand, kW 14459 14821 2.50\nHeat rejected, kW 39662 33177 -16.35\nFuel consumption, 103 Nm3/d 106.2 90.4 -14.93\n?, MJ/m3 oil 19.44 16.54 -14.93\nExhaust mass flow, kg/s 60.85 56.31 -7.45\nThermal efficiency 0.2946 0.3550 20.50\n?P 0.9897 0.9913 0.16\n?II 0.1250 0.1461 16.91\n\n4.5 PRODUCTION PARAMETER PROFILES\n\nGiven the chosen performance indicators and based on the ob-\ntained results concerning the integration of the ORC within the plant,\nan analysis of the behavior of the plant performance when varying pro-\nduction parameters is done by comparing the base case with that with\nthe ORC incorporated. These results can bring a better understand-\ning of the effect of the ORC over the performance of the plant under\nchanging operation conditions, which is the most common situation in\nthis type of installation. As described earlier in Sec. 3.2.4, the perfor-\nmance of the plant was evaluated along an arbitrary production profile\nformed by 16 cases varying 5 production parameters separately, such\nthat each parameter was modified (increased or reduced) independently\nalong 4 cases. Table 25 presents the chosen production parameters to-\ngether with their variation ranges and associated cases. The base case\nanalyzed in previous sections corresponds to the case N? 6.\n\n4.5.1 ORC working Tev establishment\n\nPrior to the evaluation of the production profile, it is necessary\nto establish the ORC working Tev in each scenario. In that way, Tab. 26\n\n\n\n81\n\nTable 25 \u2013 Production parameters profiles.\n\nParameter Range Cases Behavior\n\nProduced oil, m3/d 1800 - 9000 0 - 3 increased\nProduction water, m3/d 200 - 3800 3 - 6 increased\nWell pressure, kPa 1500 - 3000 6 - 9 decreased\nGas injected, 10 6\u00b7 Nm3/d 1.5 - 2.1 9 - 12 increased\nSeawater injected, m3/d 12000 - 18000 12 - 15 increased\n\npresents the selected temperatures using the criterion described in the\nprevious section. By the other side, Fig. 37 displays the curves of\nthe total rejected heat as a function of ORC Tev for some reference\nscenarios with the aim of illustrating the adopted method and show\nthe local minimum found in each case.\n\nTable 26 \u2013 ORC Tev chosen for each case.\n\nCase Tev Min. Heat, kW\n\n0 226.8 32097\n1 229.7 32383\n2 226.8 32658\n3 229.7 32929\n4 229.7 33028\n5 229.7 33118\n6 226.8 33177\n7 229.7 33180\n8 229.7 33183\n9 229.7 33180\n10 229.7 36085\n11 229.7 38961\n12 226.8 41829\n13 226.8 41829\n14 226.8 43042\n15 229.7 43641\n\nAs can be seen, the minimum heat rejected by the plant is appar-\nently located at a Tev between 223.8 and 232.6\n\n?C independently the\noperation conditions of the plant (the values found for Tev were 226.8\n?C in some cases and 229.7 ?C in the others). This range is relatively\nwide (8.8 ?C) and it is not possible to conclude where the minimum\n\n\n\n82\n\nis located because the number of points within the analyzed Tev range\nwere not enough to obtain a narrower range for its location. An al-\ngorithm of optimization can be applied in further analysis in order to\ncalculate its value with more accuracy and determine if it is constant\nindependently to the operation parameters of the plant.\n\nFigure 37 \u2013 Total rejected heat vs. ORC Tev for selected scenarios.\n\n4.5.2 Influence of production parameters over the plant per-\nformance\n\nConcerning the power plant demand, it can be seen in Fig. 38(i)\nthat is widely dominated by the injection of gas and seawater. The\n\n\n\n83\n\nreduction of well pressure evidently has no effect over the power supply\nto the plant and the pumping work (produced oil and production water)\nis not appreciable when compared with the injection processes. By the\nother hand, the integration of the ORC system gives a slight increase\nof power demand due to its pumping work. Analogously, the rejected\nheat presents a great dependence with the operation that reports the\nlarger energy consumption, which is logical since the greater demand,\nthe higher the power generated by the gas turbines, thus more is the\nfuel burned and the exhaust gases rejected. The rejection of heat is\nnotably reduced by the ORC integration, a reduction of about 15.4-\n18.5% is reported along the entire production profile. Evidently, an\nincrease of the work supplied by the ORC implies a reduction of the\nwaste heat of the plant.\n\nFigure 38 \u2013 Total rejected heat (i), power demand (i) and thermal\nefficiency of power generation (ii) profiles.\n\nBy other side, the thermal efficiency of the power generation\nwithin the plant is presented in Fig. 38(ii). Initially for cases 0 to\n3, there is a little increase in thermal efficiency when the ORC is not\nincluded. However, the opposite is found when this system is operating.\nThis behavior could be associated with the heat withdrawal in the\nheat exchanger E-B02: as the oil or water flow increases, the heat\ntransferred to the well fluid in this equipment also increases. Thus, the\nexergy transferred by the HTF for activating the ORC diminish with\nthe inherent decrease in ORC output (as illustrated in Fig. 39).\n\nAnalogously to the power demand and rejected heat, the thermal\n\n\n\n84\n\nFigure 39 \u2013 ORC input and output, MW.\n\nefficiency of the plant is strongly influenced by the injection of gas and\nseawater processes. Also considering that the inherent efficiency of the\ngas turbines increases as their load increases, a notable enhancement\nof about 20-24.4% is obtained along the entire profile when applying\nthe ORC system for WHR.\n\nThe degree of thermodynamic perfection ?P together with the\nproposed indicator ? are particularly influenced by the quantity of the\nproduced oil in the plant (see Fig. 40(i)). It is likely that this behavior\nis linked with the great exergy content of oil and to the rapid decrease of\nthe ratio between the consumed energy and oil production respectively.\nThe influence of the other parameters over ?P and ? is illustrated in\nFig. 40(ii), where the first three cases were omitted. An increase in\nthe production water flow reduces marginally ?P , which is associated\nwith the inherent increase of the exergy losses. While it practically has\nno effect over the ? value. A similar situation is reported for the well\npressure, but its decrease slightly improves the value of ?P evidently due\nto the reduction of the exergy destroyed at inlet manifolds (represented\nby valve L-B00).\n\nBy the other hand, the injection of gas and water has a greater\nimpact over these indicators. It seems that he increase of gas and\nwater flows implies a decrease of ?P , and an increase in ?. It could\n\n\n\n85\n\nFigure 40 \u2013 ?P and ?: (i) for cases 0 through 15 and (ii) for cases 3\nthrough 15.\n\n\n\n86\n\nbe linked to the greater exergy losses rejection in the injection systems\nand the increment of the energy consumption respectively. Anew, the\napplication of ORC seems to be favorable for the performance of the\nplant independently of the operation conditions. The improvement was\naround 0.15-0.59% and 15.8-18.4% for ?P and ? respectively.\n\nIn general, the exergy performance indicator ?II exhibits a greater\nvariation along the production profile than ?P and ? (see Fig. 41). As\nit can be seen in Fig. 41(i), the shape of the curve for the plant with\nthe ORC incorporated is approximately the same as that displayed in\nthe base case. However, this graph was split into case groups depend-\ning on the varying parameter in order to obtain a better resolution.\nFirst, it seems that the behavior of ?II displays the same effect that\n?I in the first three cases (see Fig. 41(ii)), where the decrease of the\nperformance efficiency is related to the amount of heat withdrawn by\nthe HTF to activate the ORC. However, between the third and fourth\ncase, there is a sudden rise in the ?II value. The causes of this behavior\nare not clear, but it can be attributable to the simultaneous influence\nof the separation addend (which is increasing) and the decline of ORC\noutput on the indicator ?II . In the same way, the behavior of ?II with\nrespect to the production water flow and well pressure can be seen in\nFig. 41(iii) and (iv) respectively. While the increase of the production\nwater flow results in a decrease of the exergy efficiency due clearly to\nthe growth of the exergy losses associated with this stream, a reduction\nof well pressure prior to manifold valves demonstrate an improvement\nof ?II . It could be linked to the reduction of the destroyed exergy at\nthis point.\n\nBy other side, the rise of the injected gas and seawater flows\nincrements the value of the overall ?II . It could be explained by the\nincrement of the ratio between the product exergy and the consumed\nexergy as the gas or seawater flow increases in each subsystem. In\naddition, the ORC contribution seems to be uniform along these profiles\nas illustrated in Figs. 41(v) and 41(vi).\n\nWith the purpose of comparing the influence of the analyzed pro-\nduction parameters over the exergy efficiency of the plant and contrast\nit with that using the coupled ORC, an influence factor f is introduced\nfor each segment shown in Fig. 41 using the following expression:\n\nf =\n\n??????II??n\n???? (4.3)\n\nwhere ?n corresponds to the normalized production parameter\n\n\n\n87\n\nFigure 41 \u2013 ?II variation along the production profile.\n\n\n\n88\n\n(i.e. ? represents the oil flow, well pressure, water flow, etc.). As\ncan be seen from Fig. 42(i), the amount of injected seawater seems\nto be the variable with the greatest weight over the exergy indicator\n?II (i.e. a variation of seawater flow results in a greater variations of\n?II when compared with the other parameters), independently to the\nvariation of the other production parameters. In contrast, the produced\noil has the lowest influence over this indicator when no ORC is used\nand its impact presents a slight decline as this flow increases. By other\nside, the effect of the injected gas increase and the production water\ndecrease is intermediate and presents a minimal drop as the injected gas\nincreases while the effect of the production water seems to be constant.\nAnalogously, the influence of the well pressure over ?II appears to be\ngreater as its value decreases.\n\nFigure 42 \u2013 Influence factor f for each production parameter. (i) cur-\nrent configuration, (ii) ORC integrated.\n\nIt can be inferred from Fig. 41 that the improvement of ?II of\n\n\n\n89\n\nthe plant using the ORC was around 14-17% along the entire profile.\nDespite its contribution apparently was uniform in whole the range,\ndata presented in Fig. 42(ii) suggest that the impact of the produc-\ntion parameters over the plant performance using the ORC was altered\nwhen compared with the current configuration. The increase of ?II is\ndominated principally by the amount of injected water, except when\nthe flow of production water approaches its minimum value (point at\nupper right corner). Analogously, as the injected gas flow and well\npressure increase, their impact over the exergy performance decrease.\nThe influence of oil flow along the profile is not very clear probably\ndue to the simultaneous effect of the ORC output and the separation\naddend in the definition of ?II . A further analysis can be conducted\nin order to analyze the impact of these parameters separately over the\nexergy performance as defined in this work.\n\n4.5.3 Influence of the production parameters over ORC per-\nformance\n\nFigure 43 \u2013 Influence factor f for each production parameter applied\nin the ORC performance.\n\n\n\n90\n\nAs mentioned earlier, when an ORC system is used as WHR\nsystem, it is more advantageous to obtain a greater output than a\ngreater efficiency. Consequently, the variable analyzed to determine\nthe influence of the production parameters over the performance of\nthis system was its power output (as illustrated in Fig. 39). In general,\nit was found that the oil and water flows have a negative impact over\nthe ORC input. As mentioned previously, the greater the fluid flow,\nthe lower the amount of heat for activating the ORC; thus the lower its\noutput. Analogously, well pressure has no practical effect over the ORC\noutput and the injection of gas and seawater dominates noticeably the\nperformance of this system. Evidence for this is presented in Fig. 43,\nwhere the influence factor introduced previously was applied to the\nORC output.\n\nAs noted earlier, the parameter with the greatest influence over\nORC performance is the gas injection/export followed by the seawater\ninjection, except when the oil flow is low enough to promote the amount\nof heat transferred to the ORC (a situation that is unlike given the main\npurpose of the plant). This tendency is evidently caused by the power\nconsumed by both injection operations. The greater the amount of\ngas (or water) to be injected, greater the required power of the plant\nand more gas is burned in turbines, which produce more exhaust gases;\nthus more available heat to activate the cycle. In contrast, although\nthe effect of the reduction of water flow increases along the profile,\nthis is not enough to overcome the effect of the injection processes.\nAs predicted before, the effect of the reduction of well pressure has no\ninference over the performance of ORC.\n\n\n\n91\n\n5 DISCUSSION\n\nPrevious works focused on the implementation of ORC technol-\nogy for WHR in offshore platforms have demonstrated its usefulness\nunder specified conditions in particular platforms (LARSEN et al., 2013;\nPIEROBON; NGUYEN, 2012b; PIEROBON et al., 2013). However, these\nstudies have not considered the inherent variation in the platform pro-\ncess conditions along its lifespan and by the other side, the exergy\nanalysis for identifying the operations that more strongly demote the\nefficiency of a process has not been fully adopted in this type of indus-\ntry. In that way, this work implements the exergy analysis approach\nto examine the effect of an ORC over the performance of a Brazilian\nFPSO under varying production conditions.\n\nThe adopted procedure dealt with the adequate exergy calcula-\ntion of petroleum fractions and their mixtures as well as the formula-\ntion of an appropriate performance indicator associated with the main\ntasks of the plant. The calculation routines were implemented using\ntwo computer programs: Hysys and EES. Particularly, the most signif-\nicant simplifications were applied to the EES algorithm and the results\ndemonstrated a good agreement for both models concerning the over-\nall plant efficiency. However, there were discrepancies when analyzing\nthe efficiency of plant subsystems, apparently caused mainly by the\nomission of recycle streams in the EES routine.\n\nWhen the procedure for oil characterization were assuming a\ngroup of pseudocomponents, it is recommended to incorporate the cal-\nculation of chemical exergy of these hypothetical compounds together\nwith their Gibbs free energy (?fG\n\no), in order to avoid uncertainties\nwhen a chemical reaction were carrying out within the model. How-\never, it is important to emphasize the fact that all the exergy balances\ndone in this work were corroborated using the relation between the\ngenerated entropy Sgen and the destroyed exergy BD (see Sec. 3.3.2),\nshowing a good agreement.\n\nAnalogously, the ORC system was modeled attached to the exist-\ning HTF circuit, taking part of the exergy of the exhaust gases coming\nfrom the gas turbines in order to produce additional power. The ORC\nworking fluid chosen was the cyclopentane and its evaporation temper-\nature was set aiming a minimum amount of rejected heat. Next, the\ncomplete model (plant + ORC) was compared with the current configu-\nration through a hypothetical profile, varying (i) the produced oil flow,\n(ii) the production water flow, (iii) the well pressure, (iv) the gas in-\n\n\n\n92\n\njected and (v) the seawater injected flow, within the design constraints\nof the plant.\n\nEvaluation of the power demand, total rejected heat and ther-\nmal efficiency of the plant indicates a wide influence of the amount of\ngas and seawater injected back to the reservoir. This observation is in\nagreement with previous studies (NGUYEN et al., 2013; VOLDSUND et\nal., 2010) and is associated with the increase of burned gas (thus the\nexhaust gases) and the rise of the power load at gas turbines. Particu-\nlarly, the ORC output and its contribution is influenced by the oil and\nproduction water flows. It must be related with the amount of heat\nwithdrawn from the HTF in heat exchanger E-B02. The greater the\noil (or water) flow, the lesser the available heat to activate the ORC.\nIn the same way, the injection of gas and water appear to have the\ngreatest effect over the performance indicators ?P and ? when the oil\nflow is not considered.\n\nThe use of the degree of thermodynamic perfection ?P , was com-\npared with another exergy indicator ?II . Although the behavior of the\nresults was similar, the figures obtained using ?II , make more evident\nthe effect of the variation of the plant operation conditions over its\nperformance.\n\nObtained results show that the ORC integration has a substan-\ntial contribution to the performance of the plant and its magnitude\nremains approximately homogeneous along the entire profile. A com-\nparison of the influence of the production parameters over the exergy\nefficiency pointed the seawater injection flow out as the parameter with\nthe greatest impact over the indicator when the ORC is not installed.\nHowever, the incorporation of the ORC demonstrates an increase of the\ninfluence of the other parameters; especially of the production water\nflow. By other side, the production variable that affects more markedly\nthe ORC output is the injected gas flow, which is directly associated\nwith the increment of the exergy carried to the ORC.\n\nThe data presented in this work are in line with previous studies\nfocused on the exergy analysis of offshore platforms and the use of ORC\nthe system for improving their energetic performance. Additionally, a\nprimary comparison of the incidence of chosen production variables\nwas carried out, demonstrating that their impact over the plant perfor-\nmance depends basically on their magnitude. Particularly in this case,\nthe water injection flow was identified as the most dominant variable\ndetermining the performance of the plant. It could be associated with\nthe fact that this operation has the best performance among the sub-\nsystems of the plant and has the second largest power demand within\n\n\n\n93\n\nthe plant. Although this observation corresponds to the analyzed plant\nspecifically, this type of comparison offers a wider panorama concern-\ning to what parameter is strongly-affecting the energy performance of\nthe plant at given circumstances. In the same way, this approach may\nbe used to analyze other types of production platforms with different\nconfigurations and processes involved. For example, for oils that have\nhigh salt content where a secondary \u201dwashing\u201d stage is included, the\nexergy contribution of the salt content should be considered at inlet\nstream(s) and its separation must be evident in the performance indi-\ncator. Another case can be the case of heavy crudes or with trend to\nform emulsions, where more heating is needed to perform the separa-\ntion of the water from the oil; here the exergy indicator proposed in this\nwork could be strongly influenced by the amount of heat involved in\nthe separation stage (as anticipated in the work of Oliveira e Hombeeck\n(1997)).\n\nAnalogously, the performance of the ORC system was evaluated\ntogether with the variation of the production parameters of the plant.\nThis innovative approach can bring a better idea of the most appropri-\nate size of the ORC system when applied to this type of installations,\nwhich would not be necessarily one with the optimal size under a spe-\ncific condition, but one that best fulfills the plant requirements and\nconstraints along its lifespan.\n\nThe understanding of the behavior of the performance of the\nplant with variable production conditions \u2013as proposed in this study,\ncould have an important contribution concerning the analysis of actual\nproduction profiles and the establishment of the actual convenience\nof an ORC system given an actual production forecast. In that way,\nit would be necessary a validation of the proposed methodology with\nknown profiles (record) of plants already established. Further analysis\ncan be conducted considering performance, control and economic opti-\nmization strategies, fluid selection and more detailed comparison of the\nproduction variables aiming the fabrication and installation of suitable\nORC systems in this industry.\n\n\n\n94\n\n\n\n95\n\n6 CONCLUSION\n\nThe present work demonstrated the advantage of implementing\nan ORC as WHR system in an existing offshore platform under variable\nproduction conditions. It was found that the ORC has a positive im-\npact over the performance of the plant independently of their operation\nconditions and its contribution seems to be homogeneous and not very\ninfluenced by production parameters of the plant. Specifically, it was re-\nported an improvement of 14-17% in the exergy performance indicator\nand a reduction of 15.8-18.4% for the fuel consumption. These figures\nevidently imply a reduction of the environmental impact of the plant,\nproved by the inherent reduction of exhaust gases emissions and the\nreduction of rejected heat to the atmosphere (calculated as 15.4-18.5%\nbased on current conditions). It would be interesting to complement\nthese results with an economic analysis (i.e. costs assessment, payback\nperiod, etc.) aiming the feasibility of implementation of this system.\nBy other side, a comparison of the influence of the production param-\neters over the performance of the analyzed plant indicated the gas and\nseawater injection as the most influencing operations over the exergy\nperformance of the plant.\n\nThe main contribution of the present work consists in a pro-\ncedure that considers variable operation parameters along the plant\nlifespan, aiming a wider panorama for exergy analysis and the appli-\ncation of ORC (or other technologies) systems in existing installations\nsubject to large variations in their process conditions. Additionally, its\napplication could offer a better understanding of the features that more\nstrongly demote their efficiency under particular circumstances.\n\nRegarding the modeling of the plant, qualitatively it was found\nthat overall performance can be directly estimated omitting the com-\nposition analysis of the petroleum. However, when assessing the indi-\nvidual performance of the equipment (or subsystems) of the plant, it\nis strongly recommended to consider the composition of the petroleum\nsince it affects importantly the exergy indicators, especially when a\nseparation of phases are involved. In that way, the approach proposed\nin this work can be useful for selecting an adequate software depend-\ning on the required level of detailing. Analogously, when all the data\nof the plant were available, it is advisable to develop and corroborate\nthe model, including all the components of the plant aiming additional\napplications for the unused exergy. For more advanced studies, it is\ndesirable to give the same thermodynamic basis for the calculation of\n\n\n\n96\n\nchemical exergy and the composition of petroleum fractions (avoiding\nthe use of empirical expressions), in such a way that discrepancies when\nconsidering chemical reactions are prevented.\n\nIt is recommended to develop a supplementary optimization al-\ngorithm aiming the most suitable Tev for the ORC, meeting the max-\nimum exergy efficiency of the plant. Nevertheless, the results of the\npresent work constitute a reference basis for further analysis focused\non the optimization of the project taking into account the minimiza-\ntion of the volume and cost of ORC components such that it fulfills the\nprocess requirements along a variable production profile. By other side\nan environmental impact analysis (e.g. LCA or exergo-environmental\nanalysis) could be useful in order to demonstrate and justify the inte-\ngration of this type of technologies beyond economic issues.\n\nIn order to promote the application of this type of technologies,\nthe examination of commercially available equipment would be advan-\ntageous, such that the ORC modelling corresponds to real cycles and\ncan address the choice of actual alternatives.\n\n\n\n97\n\nREFERENCES\n\nABDOLLAHI-DEMNEH, F. et al.

A.2) and the nomenclature is introduced in order to\nimprove the understanding of the model. In that way, Tab. 27 lists all\nthe items included within the PFD (Process Flow Diagram) together\nwith their used symbols and acronyms. Here, the letter S refers to the\nsubsystem wherein the equipment or stream is: A\u2013 power generation\nsubsystem, B\u2013 separation plant, C\u2013 boost compression subsystem, D\u2013\ngas injection/export subsystem, E\u2013 HTF circuit, F\u2013 ORC subsystem\nand H\u2013 seawater injection subsystem. In the case of work and heat\nflows, the letter Z refers to the associated equipment and correspond\nto the letter that identifies it (i.e. bold letters in acronym column). For\nexample HE-B05 identifies the heat flow (H) associated with the heater\n(E) E-B05, which is part of the separation subsystem (B). 00 refers to\nthe item numeration.\n\nTable 27 \u2013 PFD nomenclature.\n\nItem Figure Acronym\n\nMaterial stream S00\n\nHeat flow HZ-S00\n\nWork flow WZ-S00\n\nThree phase sepa-\nrator\n\nV-S00\n\nAir cooler F-S00\n\nCombustor R-A00\n\nCompressor C-S00\n\n\n\n106\n\nTable 27 \u2013 PFD nomenclature (cont.).\n\nItem Figure Acronym\n\nCooler E-S00\n\nExpander T-S00\n\nHeat exchanger E-S00\n\nHeater E-S00\n\nMixer M-S00\n\nPump P-S00\n\nRecycle R-S00\n\nSeparator V-S00\n\nSubsystem As named.\n\nTee Y-S00\n\nValve L-S00\n\n\n\n107\n\nA.2 PROCESS FLOW DIAGRAMS\n\nFigures 44 through 49 present the process flow diagrams of the\nseparation plant and its subsystems, including secondary streams as\nrecycles and condensates separated from gas streams.

Consequently, it was\nnecessary to incorporate a programing code in order to call the values\ncalculated by the software (e.g. enthalpy, entropy, etc.) and create new\nfunctions to perform the exergy calculation. In accordance with the\nproposed methodology, it was necessary to calculate the physical, the\nchemical and the mixing exergy separately to obtain the overall exergy\nflow of a stream. The following sections present the code incorporated\nwithin the program to execute these routines.\n\nOn the other hand, in order to run the cases it was necessary\nto create a code to combine adequately the calculation of the opera-\ntion conditions of the power subsystem, the separation plant and the\nORC subsystem simultaneously in order to attain the overall model\nconvergence. This code is presented in Sec. B.7.\n\nB.2 SET DEAD STATE FOR ALL THE STREAMS\n\nB.2.1 Temperature\n\nSub V a r i a b l e C h a n g e d ( )\nOn Error GoTo e r r o r h a n d l e r\nDim MS As S t r e a m s\nDim ST As P r o c e s s S t r e a m\nDim X As I n t e r n a l V a r i a b l e W r a p p e r\nDim T0 As Double\nT0=a c t i v e v a r i a b l e w r a p p e r .

In general, this model\ntakes the same inputs of that developed using Hysys. However, its\napproach is simpler and is based on various simplifying assumptions.\nThe purpose of this development is to offer a comparison framework to\nthe model developed in Hysys and investigate how the level of detailing\nof the model affect the pretended results of the simulations. Following\nsections present the main assumptions adopted and the results obtained\nusing this program.\n\nC.2 ASSUMPTIONS\n\nThe main assumptions adopted in the development of the model\nare listed as follows:\n\n\u2022Continuous operation, with constant conditions (steady state regime).\n\n\u2022Constant thermophysical properties of oil during the separation\nprocesses.\n\n\u2022The power generation system is modeled as one turbine operating\nin accordance with the data reported for the SGT-400 model (Its\nparameters are adjusted to represent both existing turbines).\n\n\u2022Gases are considered ideal.\n\n\u2022There are no interfacial or chemical interactions between the fluid\nphases (i.e. oil, gas and water).\n\n\u2022Constant composition of the associated gas through the whole\nprocess. This implies that the saturation of the gas stream with\nwater is neglected and gas dehydration is discarded.\n\nThe last two assumptions cause the well fluid to be modeled as\nthe sum of three unmixed flows (i.e. oil, gas and water), which physi-\ncally does not represent adequately the equilibrium between phases and\ncause the separation stages to be unnecessary hypothetically. However,\nconsidering that all hydrocarbons entering the plant are recognized ei-\nther as a product or as consumed fuel within the process, the results\nrelated to the overall behavior of the plant may be comparable with\nthose calculated by a detailed model.\n\n\n\n130\n\nC.3 SCHEME OF OPERATION\n\nFigure 50 \u2013 Scheme of operation of EES model.\n\n\n\n131\n\nFigure 50 presents the scheme of operation considered in the\nmodel developed using EES. Analogously, Figs. 51 and 52 show the\nschemes contemplated for the gas boosting system and gas injection/-\nexport respectively.\n\nFigure 51 \u2013 Scheme of operation of gas boost system in EES

These results are obtained\nfrom a minimum set of standardized data commonly encountered in\nthe industry. As mentioned in Aspentech (2011), the more information\nprovided, the greater the accuracy of the characterization. However,\nthe lack of information is common when modeling this type of pro-\ncess. Given that the properties and composition of crude change over\ntime and from a reservoir to another, the characterization of the crude\nshown here corresponds to a typical fluid (as shown in Tab. 8) and does\nnot pretend to model an actual fluid in detail. Moreover, the scope of\npresent work is rather focused on the energy efficiency of the processes\nthan on the crude characterization.\n\nFigures 53 through 56 present the calculated properties for the\npseudocomponents generated in order to model the crude, which corre-\nsponds to as a mixture of 34 pseudocomponents, 7 pure hydrocarbons,\nCO2, Nitrogen, Oxygen and water. In addition, Tab. 39 shows the\ncomposition of the oily phase of the crude, which reports an average\nmolecular weight of 250.7 kg/kmol.\n\nFigure 53 \u2013 TBP curve and normal boiling point (NBP) of each pseu-\ndocomponent.\n\n\n\n156\n\nTable 39 \u2013 Crude composition (oily phase).\n\nHypo name mass frac.\n\nNBP[0]121* 0.0061\nNBP[0]134* 0.0108\nNBP[0]148* 0.0139\nNBP[0]162* 0.0180\nNBP[0]177* 0.0213\nNBP[0]191* 0.0244\nNBP[0]205* 0.0272\nNBP[0]219* 0.0297\nNBP[0]234* 0.0320\nNBP[0]248* 0.0340\nNBP[0]262* 0.0357\nNBP[0]277* 0.0371\nNBP[0]291* 0.0382\nNBP[0]305* 0.0390\nNBP[0]320* 0.0396\nNBP[0]334* 0.0399\nNBP[0]348* 0.0399\nNBP[0]362* 0.0397\nNBP[0]377* 0.0393\nNBP[0]391* 0.0387\nNBP[0]404* 0.0293\nNBP[0]420* 0.0209\nNBP[0]442* 0.0659\nNBP[0]468* 0.0681\nNBP[0]495* 0.0620\nNBP[0]522* 0.0555\nNBP[0]555* 0.0940\n\n\n\n157\n\nFigure 54 \u2013 Some physical properties and lower heating value (LHV)\nof each pseudocomponent.\n\n\n\n158\n\nFigure 55 \u2013 Elemental composition of each pseudocomponent.\n\nFigure 56 \u2013 Specific heat of crude (oily phase)."}]}}}
