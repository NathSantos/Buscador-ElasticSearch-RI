The Least Limiting Water Range (LLWR) comprises soil physical\nvariables affecting root growth and soil water availability, and can be managed by\neither mechanical or biological methods.  There is evidence that effects of crop\nrotations could last longer than chiseling, so the objective of this study was to\nassess the effect of soil chiseling or growing cover crops under no-till (NT) on the\nLLWR.  Crop rotations involving triticale (X Triticosecale) and sunflower\n(Helianthus annuus) in the fall-winter associated with millet (Pennisetum\nglaucum), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea) as cover\ncrops preceding soybean (Glycine max) were repeated for three consecutive years.\nIn the treatment with chiseling (performed only in the first year), the area was left\nfallow between the fall-winter and summer crops.  The experiment was carried\nout in Botucatu, S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil, from 2003 to 2006 on a Typic Rhodudalf.\nThe LLWR was determined in soil samples taken from the layers 0\u201320 cm and 20\u2013\n40 cm, after chemical desiccation of the cover crops in December of the first and\nthird year of the experiment.  Chiseling decreases soil bulk density in the 0\u201320 cm\nsoil layer, increasing the LLWR magnitude by lowering the soil water content at\nwhich penetration resistance reaches 2.0 MPa; this effect is present up to the third\nyear after chiseling and can reach to a depth of 0.40 m.  Crop rotations involving\nsunflower + sunn hemp, triticale + millet and triticale + sunn hemp for three years\nprevented soil bulk density from exceeding the critical soil bulk density in the 0\u2013\n0.20 m layer.  This effect was observed to a depth of 0.40 m after three years of\nchiseling under crop rotations involving forage sorghum.  Hence, chiseling and\nsome crop rotations under no tillage are effective in increasing soil quality assessed\nby the LLWR.\n\nIndex terms: cover crops, crop rotation, soil compaction, no till, soil water.\n\n(1) Part of the PhD thesis of first author.

O Intervalo H\u00eddrico \u00d3timo (IHO) integra vari\u00e1veis f\u00edsicas do solo que alteram o\ncrescimento radicular e a disponibilidade de \u00e1gua e pode ser manejado por m\u00e9todos mec\u00e2nicos\nou biol\u00f3gicos.

O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar o efeito da escarifica\u00e7\u00e3o e, ou, rota\u00e7\u00e3o\nde culturas em sistema de semeadura direta (SSD) no IHO.  Rota\u00e7\u00f5es envolvendo triticale (X\nTriticosecale) e girassol (Helianthus annuus) no outono-inverno e milheto (Pennisetum\nglaucum), sorgo (Sorghum bicolor) e crotal\u00e1ria (Crotalaria juncea) com plantas de cobertura\nprecedendo a soja (Glycine max) foram repetidas por tr\u00eas anos.  No tratamento com escarifica\u00e7\u00e3o,\na \u00e1rea foi deixada em pousio entre as culturas de outono-inverno e ver\u00e3o.  O experimento foi\nconduzido em Botucatu, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brasil, de 2003 a 2006 em um Nitossolo Vermelho.  O\nIHO foi determinado em amostras de solo das profundidades de 0\u201320 e 20\u201340 cm, logo ap\u00f3s a\ndesseca\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica das plantas de cobertura, em dezembro do primeiro e do terceiro ano do\nexperimento.

As rota\u00e7\u00f5es de culturas envolvendo girassol + crotal\u00e1ria, triticale +\nmilheto e triticale + crotal\u00e1ria por tr\u00eas anos ajudaram a prevenir o aumento na densidade do\nsolo acima do valor cr\u00edtico na camada de 0\u201320 cm.  Esse efeito \u00e9 observado na camada de 20\u2013\n40 cm ap\u00f3s tr\u00eas anos da escarifica\u00e7\u00e3o e com rota\u00e7\u00f5es de culturas envolvendo sorgo.  Assim, a\nescarifica\u00e7\u00e3o e algumas rota\u00e7\u00f5es de culturas em sistema de semeadura direta s\u00e3o eficientes em\nmelhorar a qualidade do solo avaliada pelo IHO.\n\nTermos de indexa\u00e7\u00e3o: plantas de cobertura, rota\u00e7\u00e3o de culturas, compacta\u00e7\u00e3o do solo, semeadura\ndireta, \u00e1gua no solo.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe factors that affect plant growth and development\ndirectly (oxygen, water, temperature and mechanical\nimpediment) are not only influenced by soil structure\n(bulk density, aggregation state and porosity), but also\nby climate, which vary from year to year (Dexter,\n1988).  Thus, it is difficult to define critical limits beyond\nwhich crop growth and development is impaired\n(Torres &amp; Saraiva, 1999).  The recognition of these\ninteractions suggests that soil physical quality should\nbe assessed using parameters that integrate the\nphysical characteristics of the soil affecting plant\ngrowth, and using water as an equilibrium variable,\ndiminishing or aggravating the effects of aeration and\nsoil penetration resistance (Letey, 1985).\n\nPlant growth is affected when soil physical-hydric\ncharacteristics such as aeration porosity, root\npenetration resistance and/or soil water content\nimpairs water acquisition.  The interaction of these\nattributes in a single variable was defined by Silva et\nal. (1994) as the \u201cLeast Limiting Water Range\u201d\n(LLWR).  According to these authors, root growth is\nless restricted within this interval, whose upper limit\nis the soil water content at field capacity (FC) or the\nsoil water content when the air-filled porosity equals\n10 %.  The LLWR lower limit is the soil water content\n\nat the permanent wilting point (PWP) or the soil water\ncontent where soil penetration resistance is equal to\n2.0 MPa.  There are reports showing that soil\nmanagement systems leading to lower LLWR expose\ncrops to more frequent stress due to excess or lack of\nwater (Kay, 1990; Silva &amp; Kay, 1996; Lapen et al.,\n2004).\n\nSoil water contents at the adequate aeration\nporosity and soil penetration resistance (SR) are more\nseverely affected by soil bulk density (Db) than by soil\nwater contents at FC and PWP, indicating that the\nLLWR is more sensitive to soil structural changes\nthan the available water (Silva et al., 1994; Tormena\net al., 1998; Betz et al., 1998; Zou et al., 2000).  Thus,\nsoil water contents to avoid limitations to plant growth\nvary with the state of soil compaction (Silva et al.,\n1994), and compaction alleviation may result in higher\nwater availability to plants in addition to decreasing\nSR.\n\nSoil compaction alleviation can be achieved by\nmechanical and/or biological processes.  In the\nmechanical method, equipments with shanks are\npreferred because they operate below the compacted\nlayer, have less surface contact and soil tillage is low\n(Vernetti J\u00fanior &amp; Gomes, 1999).  However, there is\nevidence that the positive effects of chiseling are short-\nlived (Araujo et al., 2004; Busscher et al., 2002).  On\n\n\n\nLEAST LIMITING WATER RANGE IN SOIL UNDER CROP ROTATIONS AND CHISELING               761\n\nR. Bras. Ci. Solo, 35:759-771, 2011\n\nthe other hand, important benefits have been observed\nin soil structure in the medium and long terms as a\nresult of cover crops (Fidalski et al., 2010) with high-\ncarbon fixing potential and vigorous, deep root systems\n(Dias J\u00fanior, 2000), able to grow through soil layers\nwith high resistance to penetration and creating\nbiopores where the roots of the subsequent crop can\ngrow (Silva &amp; Rosolem, 2001a).  Black oat, pigeon pea\nand pearl millet favor soybean root growth below\ncompacted soil layers (Silva &amp; Rosolem, 2002) resulting\nin better mineral nutrition (Silva &amp; Rosolem, 2001b),\nhowever, the effects on soil bulk density and\npenetration resistance were not clear.  Although\ngrasses are generally more sensitive to high soil\npenetration resistance, they have high root length\ndensities in compacted soil layers.  This was observed\nfor pearl millet and grain sorghum that are also very\nefficient in recycling nutrients.  These two species\nproved to be very appropriate as cover crops in tropical\nregions with dry winters (Rosolem et al., 2002; Silva\n&amp; Rosolem, 2003).\n\nIn view of the transient effect of chiseling, and that\nthe positive effects of cover crops on root growth and\ndevelopment of cash crops as well as the effects of\ncrop rotations on soil water availability are not well\nunderstood, the objective of this study was to determine\nthe effects of soil compaction management with\nchiseling and no-till cover crops on the least limiting\nwater range of a tropical soil.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nAn experiment was carried out in Botucatu, State\nof S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, from 2003 to 2006 on a Typic\nRhodudalf (Soil Survey Staff, 2006) or Nitossolo\nVermelho distrof\u00e9rrico A moderado (Embrapa, 2006),\nin an area that had been under no tillage for six years,\nwith a soybean/black oats/corn/triticale rotation.  The\ngeographic location of this area is latitude 22 \u00b0 49 \u2019 S,\n\nlongitude 48 \u00b0 25 \u2019 WGrw and 786 m asl.  The climate\n(K\u00f6ppen classification) is CWa, i.e., a subtropical humid\nclimate with dry winter.  The dry season is well-\ndefined between May and September.  The mean\nannual rainfall is approximately 1,400 mm, the\nhighest monthly mean temperature is over 22 \u00b0C and\nthe lowest below 18 \u00b0C.  Before starting the experiment,\na one meter-deep trench was opened and a compacted\nlayer was diagnosed 5 to 20 cm deep in the soil profile.\nThe soil was then sampled for chemical (Raij et al.,\n2001) and physical (Embrapa, 1997) analyses (Table 1).\nThe soil resistance (SR) of the profile was determined\nusing an electronic penetrograph.\n\nTreatments consisted of planting triticale (X\nTriticosecale Wittmack) and sunflower (Helianthus\nannuus) in the fall-winter, combined with pearl millet\n(Pennisetum glaucum L., var.  BN-2), forage sorghum\n(Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) and sunn hemp\n(Crotalaria juncea L.) in the spring, and an additional\ntreatment that was chiseled, all preceding the summer\ncrop (soybean \u2013 Glycine max L. (Merrill), var.\nEmbrapa 48).  The chisel plow had seven shanks on\ntwo parallel bars on a square tool carrier.  The shanks,\ninclined 25\u00b0 forward, were fixed 0.60 m apart,\nresulting in an effective between-shank spacing of\n0.30 m, with a maximum depth of 0.30 m.  A clod-\nbreaking roller was attached to break the biggest clods,\ndecrease surface roughness and spare disking.\nSoybean was grown in summer in all plots.  The crop\nsequence was repeated for three years.  The soil was\nchiseled only once, that is, after the fall-winter crop\nharvest in the first year, and the chiseled plots were\nleft fallow between the winter and summer crops\nthereafter.  The experiment was evaluated in a\ncomplete randomized block design with a split-plot\narrangement of treatments, with four replications.\nTriticale and sunflower were grown in the plots in\nthe fall/winter with pearl millet, sorghum, sunn hemp,\nand chiseling in sub-plots.  Plots were 8.0 x 32.0 m,and\nsub-plots 8.0 x 5.0 m, and blocks, plots and sub-plots\nwere 4.0 m apart.\n\nTable 1.

Solo, 35:759-771, 2011\n\nSoybean fertilization with P and K followed specific\nrecommendations for the crop according to Raij et al.\n(1996).  Sunflower and triticale were not fertilized and\nthe cover crops (in spring) received 40 kg ha-1 N as\nurea at planting.\n\nUndisturbed soil samples were collected with\nvolumetric rings (height 5.0 cm, internal diameter\n4.8 cm), and 16 samples were taken per plot (8 from\nthe center of the 0\u201320 cm and 8 from the center of the\n20\u201340 cm layer) before starting the experiment to\ncharacterize the area, and after desiccating the cover\ncrops in the first and third year of the experiment\n(just before soybean planting).\n\nThe LLWR was determined as described by Silva\net al. (1994).  The least limiting water range limits\nwere associated to critical soil volumetric water\ncontent (?) defined by the matric potential, soil\npenetration resistance, and air-filled porosity as\nfollows: the soil water retention at field capacity (?FC),\ncalculated at -0.01 MPa matric potential, the soil water\nretention at permanent wilting point (?PWP), -1.5 MPa\nmatric potential, the soil water content (?SR) at which\npenetration resistance reaches 2.0 MPa, and the soil\nwater content when the air-filled porosity (?AFP) equals\n10 %.\n\nIn the laboratory, all samples were, at first, water-\nsaturated (Embrapa, 1997) and submitted to the\nfollowing tensions: 0.002, 0.004, 0.006, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1,\n0.5, and 1.5 MPa.  A tension table was used to obtain\nmatric potentials (?) of -0.002, -0.004 and -0.006 MPa.\nFor ? of -0.01, -0.033, -0.1, -0.5, and -1.5 MPa samples\nwere placed on a porous plate apparatus.  When the\nsamples reached equilibrium, penetration resistance\nwas determined and samples were oven-dried at 105 \u00b0C\nfor 24 h to determine gravimetric moisture and soil\nbulk density (Embrapa, 1997).  The penetrograph\n(Marconi-model MA 933) consisted of a 6 mm\ndiameter metal rod with a 30\u00b0 half-angle conical tip\nand base area of 0.1256 cm\u00b2 attached to a charge cell\nheld by a mechanical arm driven by a cork screw-like\naxle.  The vertical displacement speed of the rod was\n1.0 cm min-1 to the depth of 4.0 cm.  Data obtained\nfrom the sample surface to 1.0 cm deep were discarded,\nas recommended by Tormena et al. (1998).  The\nvolumetric moisture (?) was obtained by multiplying\ngravimetric moisture by soil bulk density.  The ?FC\nand ?PWP values were determined using equation 1\n(Silva et al., 1994).\n\n? = exp (a + b Db) ?c (1)\n\nwhere ? = volumetric water content (m3 m-3); Db =\nbulk density (g cm-3); ? = matric potential (MPa); a,\nb, c = calibration coefficients.\n\nThe critical value of volumetric moisture below\nwhich SR is greater than 2.0 MPa (?SR) was obtained\nby the functional relationship between SR, ? and Db\nas in equation 2.\n\nSR = d?e Dbf (2)\n\nwhere SR = Soil penetration resistance (MPa); ? =\nvolumetric water content of the sample (m3 m-3); Db =\nsoil bulk density (g cm-3); d, e, f = calibration coefficients.\n\nFinally the ?PA was obtained by equation 3.\n\n?AFP = ?SAT \u2013 0.1 (3)\n\nwhere ?AFP = soil water content where aeration\nporosity is equal to 10 % (0.1 m3 m-3); ?SAT = (1-Db/\n2.65), and Db is the soil bulk density value (g cm-3)\nand 2.65 (g cm-3) is the assumed value of the mean\nparticle density.\n\nThus, the upper limit (UL) of the LLWR is\ndetermined by the lower value of either ?FC or ?AFP,\nthe lower limit (LL) of the LLWR equals the higher\nvalue of either ?SR or ?PWP, and LLWR is calculated\nas LLWR = UL \u2013 LL.  After calculating the upper\nand lower LLWR limits, the critical soil bulk density\n(Dbc) was determined, i.e., the soil density at which\nLLWR equals zero, (Silva et al., 1994).\n\nThe statistical software Sigma Plot 8.0 was used\nto fit equations 1 and 2 and calculate the coefficients\na, b, c, d, e, f (considered significant when p &lt;0.05)\nwith individual data fit for each treatment and depth.\nThe upper and lower LLWR limits as a function of\nsoil bulk density were determined using a XML-based\nelectronic spreadsheet, as described by Le\u00e3o &amp; Silva\n(2004).\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe determination coefficients of equations 1 and\n2 had significant F values with p &lt;0.01 (Tables 2 and\n3).  In the first year of the experiment, differences in\nLLWR were small in all treatments and both soil\nlayers (Figures 1 and 2) because the lower soil water\ncontent limit was very close to the upper limit in all\nsamples.  Chiseling led to a higher LLWR amplitude\nin the 0\u201320 cm layer (Figure 1d,h), which was not\nobserved for the 20\u201340 cm layer (Figure 2d,h).\nAccording to Carter et al. (1999), the LLWR in NT is\nlower than in conventional tillage because SR reaches\n2.0 MPa at higher moisture contents in the former\nsystem, due to the higher Db usually found in the\nconservation system.  Betz et al. (1998) and Cavalieri\net al. (2006) also observed greater LLWR in soil under\nconventional tillage and chiseling, resulting in a\nfavorable physical environment for root growth.\nRegardless of soil depth, the water content bringing\nSR to 2 MPa (?RP) equaled the lower LLWR limit in\nall samples, and was higher than ?PWP irrespective\nof Db in the first year.  This result is typical of\ncompacted soils that require high moisture to keep\nSR below the limiting value (Topp et al., 1994; Silva\net al., 1994; Muller, 2002; Beutler et al., 2006).\n\n\n\nLEAST LIMITING WATER RANGE IN SOIL UNDER CROP ROTATIONS AND CHISELING               763\n\nR.

For this reason,\nSilva et al. (1994) suggested the LLWR as a more\nsensitive tool for soil structure analyses.  According\n\nto Topp et al. (1994), the occurrence of very low, or\neven zero LLWR values is common in soils with heavy\nclay texture, as in this study (Table 1), which\nincreases the probability of physical limitations for\nroot growth (Kay, 1990).  Tormena et al. (1998), when\ndetermining the LLWR in a Red Latosol with\n\nFigure 1.

Bras. Ci. Solo, 35:759-771, 2011\n\n800 g kg-1 clay, observed that the ?SR was the lower\nlimit of soil available water, with Db > 1.10 g cm-3\nand soil moisture over 0.24 cm cm-3.  This was not\nobserved in the present experiment because in most\ntreatments the lowest Db was higher than 1.10 g cm-3\nand ?SR higher than 0.34 g cm-3, especially in the 20\u2013\n40 cm layer, which contains more clay.  Even in the\nchiseled treatments (Figure 1d,h), where the lowest\nDb were 1.05 and 1.06 g cm-3 under sunflower +\n\nchiseling and triticale + chiseling, respectively, the\n?SR represented the lower LLWR limit.  Thus, it can\nbe inferred that shortly after chiseling, this\nmanagement was not efficient in increasing the LLWR\nto reach the values similar to those reported in the\nliterature by Tormena et al.(1998), because at the same\nDb (of around 1.10 g cm-3) the ?SR was much higher,\nthat is, 0.35 g cm-3.

Bras. Ci. Solo, 35:759-771, 2011\n\nNT the limiting SR for plant growth may be higher\nthan under conventional systems.  This is possible\nbecause when roots die they leave biopores within the\nsoil profile allowing new root growth in depth (Silva\n&amp; Rosolem, 2001b).\n\nRegarding the upper limit of LLWR, the ?FC was\nthe maximum limit of soil water in all samples.\nExceptions were the chiseling treatments in the 0\u2013\n20 cm layer, where ?AFP represented the upper limit\nof LLWR at Db values higher than 1.28 and\n1.27 g cm-3 under sunflower and triticale, respectively.\nAt these Db values the moisture for 10 % air-filled\nporosity (AFP) was approximately 0.42 cm cm-3.  The\n?AFP was the upper LLWR limit in 9 and 25 %,\nrespectively, of the samples within the LLWR in the\nchiseled plots with triticale and sunflower as fall-winter\ncrops.  The replacement of ?FC by the ?AFP as the upper\nlimit of IHO is common in clayey soils, due to the low\nsoil macroporosity, as in this study (Table 1).\nTormena et al. (1998) obtained similar results in a\nclayey soil, that is, the ?AFP became the upper LLWR\nlimit, substituting the ?FC, with Db of 1.28 g cm-3,\nwith a soil volumetric moisture of around 0.42 cm cm-3.\nHowever, Pereira et al. (2010) did not observe ?AFP as\nthe upper limit of LLWR for all Db values obtained,\ndue to a high sand content (642 g kg-1).\n\nIn the two chiseled treatments with sunflower or\ntriticale in the fall-winter (Figure 1d,h), the Dbc were\nthe highest in the first year, 1.31 and 1.33 g cm-3\nrespectively.  This occurs due the large number of\nsoil fractures, helping to maintain the pre-established\ncondition of SR at 2.0 MPa, even with the increase of\nDb, increasing the Dbc.  These Dbc values were similar\nto those reported by M\u00fcller (2002) in a Red Nitossol\n(Haplortox) with 590 g cm-3 clay in the 10\u201320 cm layer\n(Dbc = 1.33 g cm-3), and higher than the 1.28 g cm-3\nDbc reported by Tormena et al. (1998) in a Red Latossol\nwith 800 g cm-3 clay in the 0 to 10 cm layer.  Cavalieri\net al. (2006) observed critical Db in treatments with\nmechanical management, decreasing the percentage\nof samples with Db > Dbc.  For Klein &amp; C\u00e2mara\n(2007), sporadic sub-soiling in areas under no tillage\nresult in favorable soil physical conditions for plant\ndevelopment, specifically by reducing the soil\npenetration resistance.\n\nIn the 20\u201340 cm layer LLWR was generally lower\nthan in the 0\u201320 cm layer (Figure 2), due to the\nrestrictive effect of the SR that reached the 2.0 MPa\nlimit value at high moisture contents, even at the\nlowest Db (?SR ? 0.40 cm cm-3).  This effect supports\nfindings by Tormena et al. (1998) who predicted a\ngreater impact of SR on LLWR deeper in the soil\nprofile.  There was no effect of chiseling on LLWR in\nthis layer, probably because it was the deepest limit\nof action of the equipment (20\u201340 cm layer) and\ntherefore the de-compaction effect occurred only down\nto the tip of each shank.  Ara\u00fajo et al. (2004) also\nobserved smaller differences in deeper Db in a\ncomparison of NT with and without sub-soiling.\n\nIn the third year of the experiment, LLWR\nincreased in the 0\u201320 cm layer in all treatments\n(Figure 3).  However, the lowest LLWR limit was still\nrepresented by ?SR, except under triticale + chiseling\nwhere, at the lowest Db values (1.02 and 1.04 g cm-3),\nthe LLWR was determined by the available water,\nthat is, by ?FC and ?PWP, which is typical of a soil\nprofile that is less restrictive to root development.  In\nthis layer, chiseling led to the greatest LLWR\namplitude, especially in plots with winter triticale\n(Figure 3d,h), where the variation in Db values was\ngreatest.  The Db values were lowest under sunflower\n+ chiseling and triticale + chiseling (1.09 and\n1.02 g cm-3, respectively), and Db values high (1.42\nand 1.49 g cm-3, respectively), which resulted in a\nhigher coefficient of variation (7.15 and 10.08 %,\nrespectively).  Cavalieri et al. (2006) also observed the\neffect of mechanical implements on the increase of\ndispersion in Db values as soil mobilization increased.\n\nIn the 20\u201340 cm layer the LLWR amplitude was\ngreater (Figure 4) under rotations involving forage\nsorghum (Figure 4b,f) and chiseling (Figure 4d,h).\nHowever, after three seasons, there was an increase\nin Dbc in most plots, both in the 0\u201320 cm (Figure 5a)\nand in the 20\u201340 cm layer (Figure 5b).  The exceptions\nwere triticale+chiseling in the 0\u201320 cm layer, where\nDbc remained at 1.33 g cm-3 and sunflower + millet\nin the 20\u201340 cm layer where the LLWR equaled zero.\n\nThe highest Dbc was observed in the 0\u201320 cm layer\nafter three years of sunflower as fall-winter crop and\nsunn hemp as cover crop preceding soybean\n(Figure 5a).  This treatment resulted in a Dbc of\n1.37 g cm-3, since the increase required in soil\nvolumetric water content to maintain SR at 2.0 MPa\nwas low, due to an increase in the Db (Figure 3c).  As\nDbc was very high, 97 % of the samples collected to\ndetermine the LLWR had Db &lt;Dbc (Figure 6a), i.e.,\na reduced probability of occurrence of highly restrictive\nconditions to plant growth (Silva &amp; Kay, 1997).\n\nCrop rotation of sunflower and sunn hemp for three\nconsecutive years resulted in the highest soil organic\nmatter (SOM) contents in the 0\u201320 cm layer (Calonego\n&amp; Rosolem, 2008), with a beneficial influence on the\nsoil structure (Mielniczuk, 1999; Zonta et al., 2006)\nand consequently on SR reduction.  According to\nSharma &amp; Bhushan (2001), biomass addition to the\nsoil increases ?AFP and decreases ?SR, resulting in a\nhigher LLWR.\n\nHigh frequencies of samples with Db &lt;Dbc were\nalso observed under triticale + millet and triticale +\nsunn hemp (94 and 91 %, respectively) in the 0\u201320 cm\nlayer.  Considering the Dbc values as a tool to assess\ntreatment effects on soil structural quality, it can be\nstated that introduction of cover crops in the system\nled to higher Dbc increases in the 0\u201320 cm soil layer,\nwith values similar to or even higher than those\nobserved in plots with mechanical intervention\n(Figure 5a).  Thus, it can be inferred that biological\nsub-soiling, rather than mechanical chiseling, would\n\n\n\nLEAST LIMITING WATER RANGE IN SOIL UNDER CROP ROTATIONS AND CHISELING               767\n\nR.

To increase SOM the system\nmust include not only grasses, but also legumes, such\nas sunn hemp in the present experiment, able to fix\nnitrogen.  Moreover, similar results could be expected\nin other soils and regions with similar climate,\n\nalthough the time of response may be different,\ndepending on the soil texture.  However, a new\nchiseling in NT and fallow areas between the fall-\nwinter and summer crops would be required.  This is\nsupported by the results presented in figure 6a in the\ntriticale+chiseling treatment, where the percentage\nof samples with Db &lt;Dbc in the 0\u201320 cm layer,\n\nFigure 3.

These results explain the\ndecrease in soybean yield with this mechanical\nmanagement, compared with plots under crop rotation\n(Calonego &amp; Rosolem, 2010).  In contrast, in the 20\u2013\n40 cm layer, although the Dbc values increased in\nmost treatments with cover crops, the values still\n\nremained lower than in chiseled plots (Figure 5b).  For\nthis reason, chiseling resulted in the highest frequency\nof samples (63 and 69 %) with Db &lt;Dbc (Figure 6),\ncorroborating results of Cavalieri et al. (2006), who\nobtained a sample frequency of 56 % with Db &lt;Dbc\nin chiseled soils, against 25 % in treatments without\nmechanical intervention, in the 15\u201330 cm layer.\n\nFigure 4.

Bras. Ci. Solo, 35:759-771, 2011\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n1. Chiseling decreases soil bulk density in the 0\u2013\n20 cm soil layer, increasing the LLWR magnitude by\nlowering the soil water content at which penetration\nresistance reaches 2.0 MPa; this effect is measurable\nuntil the third year after chiseling, to a depth of 0.40 m.\n\n2. Crop rotations with sunflower + sunn hemp,\ntriticale + millet and triticale + sunn hemp for three\nyears prevented soil bulk density from exceeding the\ncritical bulk density in the 0\u20130.20 m layer. However,\nthis effect is observed to a depth of 0.40 m,after three\nyears of chiseling and crop rotations involving forage\nsorghum.\n\n3. Chiseling and some crop rotations under no\ntillage are effective in increasing soil quality as\nassessed by the LLWR.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis research was funded by FAPESP (research\nfoundation of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo) and CNPq\n(National Council for Scientific and Technological\nDevelopment).\n\nLITERATURE CITED\n\nARA\u00daJO, M.A.; TORMENA, C.A.; INOUE, T.T. &amp; COSTA,\nA.C.S.
