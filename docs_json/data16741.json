Previous studies have tested calcium\n\nsupplementation and aspirin separately to reduce the incidence of preeclampsia but not the effects of combined\n\nsupplementation. The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of aspirin combined with calcium\n\nsupplementation to prevent preeclampsia in women with chronic hypertension. A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized\n\nclinical trial was carried out at the antenatal clinic of a large university hospital in Sa?o Paulo, SP, Brazil. A total of 49 women\n\nwith chronic hypertension and abnormal uterine artery Doppler at 20-27 weeks gestation were randomly assigned to receive\n\nplacebo (N = 26) or 100 mg aspirin plus 2 g calcium (N = 23) daily until delivery. The main outcome of this pilot study was\n\ndevelopment of superimposed preeclampsia. Secondary outcomes were fetal growth restriction and preterm birth. The rate of\n\nsuperimposed preeclampsia was 28.6% lower among women receiving aspirin plus calcium than in the placebo group (52.2 vs\n73.1%, respectively, P=0.112). The rate of fetal growth restriction was reduced by 80.8% in the supplemented group (25 vs\n4.8% in the placebo vs supplemented groups, respectively; P=0.073). The rate of preterm birth was 33.3% in both groups. The\ncombined supplementation of aspirin and calcium starting at 20-27 weeks of gestation produced a nonsignificant decrease in\n\nthe incidence of superimposed preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction in hypertensive women with abnormal uterine artery\n\nDoppler.\n\nKey words: Preeclampsia; Hypertension; Ultrasonography; Doppler; Calcium carbonate; Aspirin\n\nIntroduction\n\nHypertensive disorders in pregnancy are still the\n\nleading cause of maternal mortality in developing nations.\n\nAccording to the most recent World Health Organization\n\nreview, hypertensive disorders accounted for 25% of all\n\nmaternal deaths in Latin America and the Caribbean,\n\nleading to 3800 deaths each year in the region (1).\n\nSuperimposed preeclampsia is a condition characterized\n\nby increasing blood pressure and proteinuria after the\n\n20th week of pregnancy in women with pre-existing\n\nchronic hypertension (2). Superimposed preeclampsia\n\nusually develops earlier than other hypertensive disorders\n\nof pregnancy, tends to be more severe, and can lead to\n\nfetal growth restriction, elective preterm delivery, and\n\nincreased risk for perinatal mortality. It can also lead to\n\nsevere adverse maternal outcomes, including hyperten-\n\nsive encephalopathy, heart or kidney failure, placental\n\nabruption, HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes,\n\nlow platelets) syndrome, and maternal mortality (3-5). It is\n\nestimated that approximately 14 to 78% of all women with\n\npre-existing chronic hypertension will develop super-\n\nimposed preeclampsia during pregnancy; those with\n\nabnormal uterine artery Doppler are at even higher risk\n\n(4-11).\n\nSecond-trimester uterine artery Doppler ultrasound\n\nhas been used for over a decade to screen women at high\n\nrisk of preeclampsia. Increased impedance to flow in the\n\nuterine arteries in unselected women during the second\n\ntrimester of pregnancy identifies approximately 40% of\n\nthose who subsequently will develop preeclampsia.\n\nCompared to individual baseline risk, abnormal uterine\n\nDoppler findings increase the likelihood of preeclampsia\n\nby six times in unselected populations (12).\n\nScreening is only worthwhile if there is an effective\n\nintervention available to prevent the disease or improve\n\nCorrespondence: M.R.

In the mid 1980s, small trials suggested that the\n\nprophylactic use of antiplatelet agents could reduce the\n\nincidence of preeclampsia (13,14). However, subsequent\n\nfindings of larger trials did not support routine prophylactic\n\nor therapeutic use of aspirin (15-18), and a meta-analysis\n\nof individual data from 31 trials involving 32,000 women of\n\nvarying baseline risk concluded that the use of antiplatelet\n\nagents during pregnancy is associated with a modest but\n\nsignificant reduction of several outcomes including pre-\n\neclampsia (RR=0.90, 95%CI=0.84-0.97), delivery\n\nbefore 34 weeks (RR=0.90, 95%CI=0.83-0.98), and\n\nany serious adverse outcome (RR=0.90, 95%CI=0.85-\n\n0.96) (19). The use of aspirin seems to be more effective\n\nin reducing the incidence of preeclampsia in high-risk\n\nwomen than in those of low to moderate risk. A systematic\n\nreview on aspirin to prevent preeclampsia in women at\n\nhigh risk due to abnormal second-trimester uterine artery\n\nDoppler identified five small randomized trials that\n\nincluded a total of approximately 500 women receiving\n\n50-100 mg aspirin daily and reported a significant reduc-\n\ntion in the incidence of preeclampsia (OR=0.55,\n\n95%CI=0.32-0.95) (20). However, 2 years later, a large\n\nrandomized controlled trial that tested low-dose aspirin in\n\n560 women with abnormal artery Doppler at 23 weeks of\n\ngestation did not confirm those results. According to the\n\nauthors, supplementation with 150 mg aspirin did not\n\nsignificantly decrease the incidence of preeclampsia (18\n\nvs 19%, P=0.6 in the aspirin and placebo groups,\nrespectively), preterm delivery due to preeclampsia (6\n\nvs 8%, P=0.36) or birth weight below the fifth centile (22\nvs 24%, P=0.4) (21). Supplementation with low-dose\naspirin during pregnancy is safe. The incidence of\n\npotential adverse effects associated with aspirin, such\n\nas ante- or post-partum hemorrhage and placental\n\nabruption, were not significantly different in over 32,000\n\nwomen randomly assigned to receive aspirin versus\n\nplacebo (19).\n\nCalcium has also been tested for the prevention of\n\npreeclampsia. A systematic review of 13 randomized trials\n\nthat included over 15,000 women concluded that supple-\n\nmentation with 1-2 g calcium carbonate starting in the\n\nsecond trimester significantly reduced preeclampsia\n\n(RR=0.45, 95%CI=0.31-0.65), and this effect was\n\ngreater in high-risk women (five trials, 587 women;\n\nRR=0.22, 95%CI=0.12-0.42), and in those with low\n\nbaseline calcium intake (eight trials, 10,678 women;\n\nRR=0.36, 95%CI=0.20-0.65) (22). No side effects of\n\ncalcium supplementation were reported in the 13 trials\n\nincluded in the review.\n\nDespite some controversial findings, the existing\n\nevidence indicates that supplementing high-risk women\n\nwith low-dose aspirin and calcium can potentially reduce\n\ntheir risk of developing preeclampsia. In 2011, the World\n\nHealth Organization (23) recognized calcium and aspirin\n\nsupplementation during pregnancy as effective interven-\n\ntions to prevent preeclampsia and to reduce maternal\n\nmortality. However, major questions remain unanswered,\n\nsuch as which specific subgroups of women are more\n\nlikely to benefit from this prophylactic medication, what is\n\nthe best gestational age to start this preventive treatment,\n\nand what is the ideal dose of the supplements (23,24).\n\nAdditionally, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have\n\nanalyzed the effects of the combined administration of\n\nthese two supplements on the rate of preeclampsia in\n\nhigh-risk women.\n\nThus, the main objective of this pilot study was to test\n\nthe hypothesis that the administration of a combination of\n\nlow-dose aspirin and calcium would reduce the risk of\n\nsuperimposed preeclampsia in women at high risk for this\n\ncondition due to chronic hypertension and abnormal\n\nuterine artery Doppler in the second trimester.\n\nSecondary outcomes of interest in this population were\n\nreduction in the rate of fetal growth restriction and preterm\n\ndelivery.\n\nMaterial and Methods\n\nThis randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled\n\nstudy took place at the antenatal clinic for hypertensive\n\ndisorders of a large, tertiary, university hospital located in\n\nthe southern region of the city of Sa?o Paulo, SP, Brazil.\n\nThis clinic offers free antenatal care to low-income\n\nwomen. Throughout the study period, the same team of\n\nphysicians and nurses cared for all the women enrolled in\n\nthe study. All participants delivered at the university\n\nhospital and were followed for 6 weeks post-partum.\n\nAll women receiving antenatal care and planning to\n\ndeliver at the university hospital, and carrying a live,\n\nstructurally normal, singleton fetus between 20 and 27\n\nweeks of gestation were eligible if they had chronic\n\nhypertension and an abnormal uterine Doppler exam.\n\nChronic hypertension was defined as known history of\n\npre-existing hypertension prior to pregnancy, or blood\n\npressure readings >140 systolic and/or >90 mmHg\n\ndiastolic on two occasions over 6 h apart before week\n\n20 of gestation (2). Gestational age was ascertained by\n\nmenstrual dates confirmed by obstetric ultrasound prior to\n\n20 weeks. In case of discrepancies greater than 8 days,\n\nsonographic gestational age was used. Doppler ultra-\n\nsound screening of uterine arteries is routinely performed\n\nat this antenatal clinic in all hypertensive women at 20 to\n\n27 weeks. The first author performed all Doppler exams\n\nusing a Diasonics Synergy Color Doppler ultrasonography\n\nunit (OEC Diasonics, USA) with a 3.5-MHz transducer.\n\nUterine arteries were identified through the transabdom-\n\ninal route using color Doppler. The filter was kept at 50-\n\n100 Hz, the angle of insonation was less than 606 and a\n\n3-mm caliper was placed in the lumen of the vessels.\n\nWomen with a high-resistance index (.0.55) and/or a\n\nprotodiastolic notch in the placental side or in both uterine\n\narteries were diagnosed as having abnormal uterine\n\nDoppler (25) and were eligible to enter the study.\n\n420 E.V. Souza et al.\n\nBraz J Med Biol Res 47(5) 2014 www.bjournal.com.br\n\n\n\nWomen were ineligible to participate in the study if they\n\nhad increased risk of bleeding due to coagulation\n\ndisorders or placenta previa, asthma, allergy to aspirin,\n\nalready been diagnosed with preeclampsia before 28\n\nweeks of gestation, or were planning to deliver in other\n\nhospitals.\n\nA single private laboratory (Farma?cia de Manipulac?a?o\n\nAmarylis, Brazil) provided all the study medications (pills\n\ncontaining either 100 mg aspirin or microcrystalline\n\ncellulose and 365-cm transparent plastic envelopes\ncontaining 2 g elemental calcium in the form of calcium\n\ncarbonate powder, or cellulose). Placebo pills and powder\n\nwere matched to the study supplements for taste, color\n\nand size.\n\nRandomization was carried out using a list of\n\ncomputer-generated random numbers provided by the\n\nBrazilian Cochrane Centre. Packets containing identical\n\nlooking supplements or placebo (pills and envelopes\n\ncontaining a powder) were placed in individual, consecu-\n\ntively numbered boxes by staff of the Cochrane Centre.\n\nEach box contained either supplements or placebo\n\nfollowing the sequence generated by the randomization\n\nlist. Included participants were given the next consecutive\n\nprepacked, numbered box in the order of enrollment. The\n\nstudy participants and the medical team caring for them\n\nwere blinded as to the contents of the boxes.\n\nUpon enrollment, each woman received a box with\n\n140 identical looking oblong white pills (containing either\n\n100 mg aspirin or cellulose) and 140 plastic envelopes\n\n(containing either 2 g calcium or cellulose). They were\n\nasked to keep the box at room temperature away from\n\ndirect sunlight and instructed to swallow one pill and\n\ndissolve one envelope of the powder in a glass of water\n\ndaily, in the morning, approximately 2 h after breakfast.\n\nAll participants were specifically instructed not to take\n\nany aspirin or calcium supplements until delivery. A\n\nprescription for acetominophen was given to all partici-\n\npants to be taken in case of pain. At each follow-up visit\n\nuntil delivery, patients were questioned about the use of\n\nany medication since their last visit and the study\n\ninstructions were repeated. Women were asked to return\n\nthe medication boxes on their first post-partum visit\n\nincluding the remaining unused pills and envelopes,\n\nwhich were then counted. Adherence was classified as\n\npoor when the participant had taken less than 50% of the\n\nprescribed daily medication prior to delivery, regular for\n\nthose taking 50-69% of the medication, and good for\n\nthose taking 70% or more.\n\nThe main outcome was superimposed preeclampsia,\n\ndefined by a) new-onset proteinuria (.300 mg/24 h) after\nthe 20th week of pregnancy in a woman with pre-existing\n\nhypertension without proteinuria or b) the sudden\n\nincrease in proteinuria, blood pressure, or platelet count\n\n,100,000/mm\n3\n, in women with pre-existing hypertension\n\nand proteinuria before 20 weeks of gestation (1).\n\nSecondary outcomes were preterm delivery (before 37\n\nweeks) and fetal growth restriction, defined as birth weight\n\nbelow the third centile for gender and estimated gesta-\n\ntional age, as described by Yudkin et al. (26). Gestational\n\nage at delivery was estimated as previously described, by\n\nmenstrual dates confirmed through sonogram prior to 20\n\nweeks of gestation. The investigators collected data on\n\noutcomes of interest directly from patient charts during\n\npregnancy and after delivery.\n\nTo calculate sample size, the records of all women\n\nwith chronic hypertension who received antenatal care in\n\nthe clinic in the past 5 years were reviewed and those with\n\nabnormal second-trimester uterine artery Doppler were\n\nselected. The incidence of superimposed preeclampsia in\n\nthis group was over 50%. Based on an expected rate of\n\nsuperimposed preeclampsia of 55% in the participants,\n\nand an estimated reduction of approximately 50% in this\n\nincidence in the group receiving aspirin plus calcium, with\n\nan alpha of 5% and a power of 80%, a total of 22 women\n\nwould have to be randomly assigned to each group.\n\nThe two-sample test for equality of proportions, the\n\nchi-square test or the Fisher exact test, the independent-\n\nsamples t-test, and the Mann-Whitney test were used to\ncompare the outcomes in the placebo and study groups.\n\nP,0.05 was considered to be significant. All analyses\n\nwere conducted according to intention to treat. The Ethics\n\nCommittee of Universidade Federal de Sa?o Paulo\n\n(UNIFESP) approved the study, and all participants gave\n\nwritten informed consent upon enrollment.\n\nResults\n\nA total of 65 women with chronic hypertension and\n\nabnormal uterine artery Doppler were receiving antenatal\n\ncare at the clinic during the study period; 14 did not meet\n\nthe selection criteria, 2 refused to participate, and 49 were\n\nrandomly assigned \u2013\u2013 26 to the placebo group and 23 to\n\nthe treatment group. There were no losses of follow-up, all\n\nwomen continued antenatal care, and were delivered at\n\nthe study hospital. Analyses of the main outcome (super-\n\nimposed preeclampsia) were performed on the 23 treated\n\npatients and the 26 women who received placebo\n\nsupplements. There were four stillbirths; two in the\n\nplacebo group at 20 and 27 weeks (both due to severe\n\nfetal growth restriction), and two in the treated group at 28\n\nand 37 weeks (both due to placental abruption). These\n\nfour cases were excluded from the analyses on fetal\n\ngrowth restriction and preterm delivery but were included\n\nin the preeclampsia analyses (Figure 1). None of the\n\nparticipants had eclampsia. There were no adverse\n\nevents, side effects or complications that could be\n\nattributed to supplementation.\n\nThere were no significant differences in the two\n\ngroups as to age, parity, race, body mass index, and\n\nblood pressure at randomization (Table 1). Adherence to\n\nprescribed treatment did not differ significantly between\n\ngroups; the vast majority of women took over half of the\n\nAspirin plus calcium to prevent superimposed preeclampsia 421\n\nwww.bjournal.com.br Braz J Med Biol Res 47(5) 2014\n\n\n\nprescribed medication (88.4 and 95.6% for the placebo\n\nand treatment groups, respectively).\n\nThe rate of superimposed preeclampsia was 28.6%\n\nlower among women receiving aspirin plus calcium than in\n\nthe placebo group (52.2 vs 73.1%, respectively), but this\ndifference did not reach statistical significance\n\n(P=0.112). Women receiving aspirin plus calcium also\n\nhad nonsignificant reductions in the rates of low and very\n\nlow birth weight infants and slightly heavier infants. There\n\nwas an 80.8% reduction in the rate of fetal growth\n\nrestriction in the supplemented group (4.8 vs 25%), but\nthis difference fell short of statistical significance\n\n(P=0.073). One third of the live births in both groups\n\nwere delivered before 37 weeks (Table 2).\n\nDiscussion\n\nAs expected, there was a very high rate of super-\n\nimposed preeclampsia in this selected group of high-risk\n\nwomen, with over 50% of all participants developing this\n\ncomplication. This led to a large number of growth-\n\nrestricted infants and elective preterm deliveries.\n\nSupplementation with 100 mg aspirin plus 2 g calcium\n\nstarting after 20 weeks of pregnancy reduced the rate of\n\nsuperimposed preeclampsia by 28.6% and the rate of\n\nfetal growth restriction by 80.8% in these women with\n\nFigure 1.

However, these reductions fell\n\nshort of statistical difference. The supplements did not\n\nhave an effect on the rate of preterm delivery.\n\nWe cannot compare our findings to others since this is\n\nthe first study to test this combination of supplements in\n\nthe prevention of preeclampsia. Although we observed\n\nbeneficial effects in the supplemented group, the size of\n\nthis effect fell short of our prediction, which was a 50%\n\nreduction in the rate of superimposed preeclampsia. A\n\npossible factor for this smaller effect could be the\n\nrelatively late initiation of low-dose aspirin therapy, at a\n\nmean of 22-23 weeks gestation. As previously described,\n\nlow-dose aspirin before week 16 is more effective in\n\npreventing preeclampsia (27). However, as in most\n\ndeveloping countries, many high-risk women in our setting\n\nbook late for antenatal care. Another possible explanation\n\nfor the smaller than expected effect of combined\n\nsupplementation could be an interaction between aspirin\n\nand calcium that reduced the bioavailability of each\n\nsubstance. This hypothesis cannot be confirmed or\n\nrefuted because we did not assess the plasma concen-\n\ntration of calcium or aspirin in the participants.\n\nPharmacological aspects of calcium administration could\n\nalso have played a role in the lower than expected effects\n\nof the supplements. The bioavailability of calcium\n\ndepends on the type of salt used, the daily dose, and\n\nwhether the supplements are ingested with food. Calcium\n\ncitrate malate has a higher bioavailability than other forms\n\nand has a good absorption even when consumed on an\n\nempty stomach. However, large doses (.500 mg/day) of\n\nthis salt are less well absorbed than lower doses (28).\n\nThe etiology and physiopathology of preeclampsia are\n\nnot yet completely understood. Preeclampsia is a com-\n\nplex disorder caused by nutritional, environmental and\n\ngenetic factors that lead to an inflammatory state,\n\nactivation of platelets, imbalance in the production and\n\nactivity of thromboxane-prostacyclin and of the free\n\nradicals nitric oxide, superoxide and peroxynitrate by the\n\nvascular endothelium (29). The probable mechanism of\n\naction of low-dose aspirin in the prevention of preeclamp-\n\nsia is by inhibiting the excessive production of thrombox-\n\nane by platelets in women who are susceptible to this\n\ndisorder (13,14,19,20). Low calcium intake may cause\n\nhigh blood pressure by stimulating the release of\n\nparathyroid hormone or renin, thus leading to increased\n\nintracellular calcium in vascular smooth muscle (30) and\n\nconsequent vasoconstriction. A possible mode of action\n\nfor calcium supplementation is that it reduces parathyroid\n\nhormone release and intracellular calcium, and so\n\nreduces smooth muscle contractility (22). The explanation\n\nof the potential benefits of offering both aspirin and\n\ncalcium to women at high risk for preeclampsia is at\n\npresent hypothetical and possibly related to reduction in\n\ninflammatory factors and oxidative stress. A recent trial\n\ninvolving a small group of Iranian women at risk for\n\npreeclampsia reported that supplementation of low-dose\n\ncalcium (500 mg) plus 80 mg aspirin for 9 weeks during\n\nthe third trimester of pregnancy resulted in increased\n\nplasma levels of glutathione, total oxidant capacity, and\n\nsignificantly lower change in high-sensitivity C-reactive\n\nprotein in the intervention group (31).\n\nOur study had several strengths, including its origin-\n\nality, rigorous care to avoid bias in all phases including\n\nselection, randomization, allocation concealment, blinding\n\nof participants and physicians, and reporting of outcomes.\n\nA potential limitation of our study was the lack of\n\ninformation on the baseline ingestion of dietary calcium in\n\nboth groups. However, since the participants were from\n\nthe same geographic setting and had similar socio-\n\neconomic characteristics, we can infer that the eating\n\nhabits of these women were probably very similar.\n\nTable 2.

According to\n\nthose studies, mean daily calcium intake was below the\n\nrecommended 1200 mg/day and ranged from 586.6 to\n\n842.9 mg/day in those specific populations of pregnant\n\nwomen (33-35). The importance of baseline dietary\n\ncalcium has been previously demonstrated in large\n\nrandomized trials of calcium supplementation for the\n\nprevention of preeclampsia (36,37). In those studies,\n\nwomen with a high dietary ingestion of calcium\n\n(.1200 mg/day) had no significant reduction in the rate\n\nof preeclampsia, but those with lower dietary calcium\n\nseemed to benefit from supplementation.\n\nAlthough this study had a relatively small sample size,\n\nall participants were women with essential chronic\n\nhypertension and abnormal uterine Doppler findings,\n\nwhich is not the case in the majority of published studies.\n\nThe sample size calculation was based on an expected\n\nrate of superimposed preeclampsia of 55% in this very\n\nhigh-risk group of women and an estimated reduction of\n\n50% in the group treated with aspirin plus calcium. There\n\nhave been no previous studies to provide guidance on the\n\nexpected effects of this combination of drugs. The first\n\npart of this estimation was based on clinical records of\n\nprevious patients and it was correct. The incidence of\n\nsuperimposed preeclampsia was 73.1% in the placebo\n\ngroup. However, the effect of the supplements was\n\noverestimated. The treated group had an incidence of\n\nsuperimposed preeclampsia of 52.2%, which corresponds\n\nto a reduction of 28.6%, instead of 50%. Therefore, for\n\nthis difference to be statistically significant, it would have\n\nbeen necessary to include approximately 82 participants\n\nin each group, instead of 22 women. Nevertheless, the\n\nresults of this pilot study are valuable for future investiga-\n\ntions on the use of combined supplements for the\n\nprevention of preeclampsia in high-risk women.\n\nThis is the first study to assess the effects of the\n\ncombined supplementation of calcium plus low-dose\n\naspirin on the prevention of preeclampsia in women at\n\nhigh risk for this complication. Our results need to be\n\nconfirmed by other studies involving a larger number of\n\nhigh-risk participants. Besides larger sample sizes, future\n\nstudies could test the introduction of combined supple-\n\nmentation at an earlier gestational age (i.e., between 16-\n\n20 weeks), determine the dietary calcium ingestion of the\n\nparticipants (e.g., through a food questionnaire), and\n\nperform bioavailability studies to ascertain the actual\n\nabsorption of aspirin and calcium.\n\nAccording to the findings of this pilot study, the\n\ncombined supplementation of aspirin and calcium starting\n\nat 20-27 weeks of gestation produced a nonsignificant\n\ndecrease in the incidence of superimposed preeclampsia\n\nand fetal growth restriction in hypertensive women with\n\nabnormal uterine artery Doppler findings.\n\nReferences\n\n1.
