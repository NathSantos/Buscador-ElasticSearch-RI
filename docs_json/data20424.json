FINAL CONSIDERATIONS ...................................................................................................................... 90 \n\n\n\n8 \n\nRESUMO \n\nCobertura florestal e qualidade da \u00e1gua de microbacias agr\u00edcolas tropicais \n\nAs florestas tropicais est\u00e3o sob constante amea\u00e7a devido ao processo de desmatamento e \n\nfragmenta\u00e7\u00e3o florestal impulsionado pelo crescimento das atividades econ\u00f4micas, em especial, a \n\nagricultura. A substitui\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1reas florestadas por outros usos do solo pode causar impactos severos \n\nna qualidade da \u00e1gua de rios, alterando suas caracter\u00edsticas f\u00edsicas, qu\u00edmicas e biol\u00f3gicas. A Mata \n\nAtl\u00e2ntica, em especial, teve sua cobertura original reduzida a cerca de 11%, sendo que a expans\u00e3o \n\nde terras cultiv\u00e1veis e urbaniza\u00e7\u00e3o ainda amea\u00e7am esse importante ecossistema e os servi\u00e7os \n\necossist\u00eamicos prestados por ele. Nesse sentido, este estudo prop\u00f4s investigar a rela\u00e7\u00e3o da cobertura \n\nflorestal com a qualidade da \u00e1gua de microbacias agr\u00edcolas tropicais. Para tanto, foram selecionadas \n\nseis microbacias experimentais com diferentes porcentagens de cobertura florestal na bacia do rio \n\nSarapu\u00ed, Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo, Brasil, onde foram feitas coletas de amostras de \u00e1gua por um ano \n\nhidrol\u00f3gico para a obten\u00e7\u00e3o de par\u00e2metros que representassem altera\u00e7\u00f5es na \u00e1gua induzidas por \n\natividades antr\u00f3picas. Inicialmente as microbacias foram classificadas em \u201cflorestadas\u201d e \n\n\u201cdegradadas\u201d, e modelos estat\u00edsticos multivariados foram aplicados para identificar diferen\u00e7as entre \n\nos grupos. Em um segundo momento comparou-se a rela\u00e7\u00e3o do uso e cobertura do solo na \n\nmicrobacia e na \u00c1rea de Preserva\u00e7\u00e3o Permanente (APP) com a qualidade da \u00e1gua utilizando-se \n\nmodelos mistos e an\u00e1lise de redund\u00e2ncia para identificar os principais fatores que influenciam a \n\nvariabilidade da qualidade da \u00e1gua. Por \u00faltimo foi gerado um modelo hidrol\u00f3gico para simular o \n\nimpacto da restaura\u00e7\u00e3o da floresta rip\u00e1ria na qualidade da \u00e1gua da bacia do rio Sarapu\u00ed onde cada \n\nmicrobacia experimental desse estudo foi representada por uma sub-bacia do modelo. Os resultados \n\nmostram que as microbacias degradadas apresentam valores maiores de s\u00f3lidos, turbidez, nutrientes \n\ne coliformes. Al\u00e9m disso, apresentam maior variabilidade temporal dos dados em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s \n\nmicrobacias florestadas associada \u00e0s altera\u00e7\u00f5es da vaz\u00e3o do rio. Em geral, a cobertura florestal foi \n\nrelacionada \u00e0 boa qualidade da \u00e1gua, enquanto que agricultura e ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o urbana foram os usos do \n\nsolo respons\u00e1veis pela degrada\u00e7\u00e3o da qualidade da \u00e1gua. O uso pastagem apresentou impactos \n\nmistos, por\u00e9m no geral n\u00e3o foi correlacionado \u00e0 qualidade da \u00e1gua ruim. Os par\u00e2metros de qualidade \n\nda \u00e1gua responderam de forma diferente quanto \u00e0 influ\u00eancia dos padr\u00f5es de uso e cobertura do solo \n\nna microbacia e na APP, por\u00e9m, considerando-se todos par\u00e2metros em conjunto, a qualidade da \u00e1gua \n\n\u00e9 melhor explicada pela composi\u00e7\u00e3o da paisagem da microbacia. Ainda assim, a simula\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\nmodelo indicou que a restaura\u00e7\u00e3o das APPs reduz a carga de sedimentos e nutrientes para o rio. Com \n\nisso, conclui-se que a floresta tropical tem papel fundamental na conserva\u00e7\u00e3o dos recursos h\u00eddricos, \n\nreduzindo impactos das atividades humanas exercidas nas microbacias e que, apesar da import\u00e2ncia \n\ndas APPs na redu\u00e7\u00e3o de poluentes para o rio, o manejo de bacias com estrat\u00e9gias de restaura\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nflorestal para toda a microbacia \u00e9 extremamente importante para a manuten\u00e7\u00e3o da qualidade da \u00e1gua \n\npara abastecimento. \n\nPalavras-chave: 1.

Replacing forest \n\nwith other land uses can cause severe impacts on river water quality, altering its physical, chemical \n\nand biological characteristics. The Atlantic Forest, in particular, had its original vegetation cover \n\nreduced to about 11%, wherein the crop lands expansion and urban sprawl still threatening this \n\nimportant ecosystem and the ecosystem services that it provides. In this sense, the main objective of \n\nthis study was to investigate the relation between forest cover and water quality of tropical \n\nagricultural watersheds. For that, six experimental watersheds with different percentage of forest \n\ncover were selected in the Sarapu\u00ed River watershed, State of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Water samples were \n\ncollected during a hydrologic year to obtain water quality parameters that represent impacts induced \n\nby anthropic activities. According to the percentage of forest cover, the watersheds were \n\ndenominated as \u201cforested\u201d, when they presented more than 55% of forest cover, and \u201cdegraded\u201d, \n\nwith less than 35%. Multivariate statistical models were applied to identify differences between \n\nthese two groups. In a second moment, the relation of land use/land cover within the watershed and \n\nwithin its respective riparian zone, represented in this study by the Permanent Preservation Areas \n\n(PPA), with water quality was compared through mixed models and redundancy analysis to identify \n\nthe main factors that influenced water quality variability. Lastly, a watershed simulation modeling \n\nwas applied to verify the impact of riparian forest restoration on water quality of the Sarapu\u00ed River \n\nwatershed, wherein each experimental watershed was represented by a sub-watershed in the model. \n\nThe results showed that the degraded watersheds presented higher values of solids, turbidity, \n\nnutrients and coliforms, besides presenting greater temporal data variability compared to forested \n\nwatersheds. This variation is associated with the stream flow changes during the year. In general, \n\nforest cover was related to good water quality, while agriculture and urban areas were responsible \n\nfor the water quality degradation. Pasture presented mixed impacts, but it was not generally \n\ncorrelated with poor water quality. The water quality parameters responded differently to the \n\ninfluence of land-use/land-cover patterns in the watershed and riparian zone, but the overall water \n\nquality is better explained by the landscape composition within the watershed. Nevertheless, the \n\nwatershed simulation indicated that PPA restoration reduces the sediment and nutrients loading into \n\nthe river. Thus, it is possible to conclude that tropical forest plays a fundamental role in the water \n\nresources conservation, reducing impacts of human activities in watersheds and the watershed \n\nmanagement with forest restoration strategies for the entire watershed is critical for the maintenance \n\nof water quality to water supply, despite the importance of the riparian zone. \n\nKeywords: Water resources 2.

INTRODUCTION \n\nNatural ecosystems play a crucial role in producing natural resources and controlling \n\nphysical, chemical and biological processes worldwide, generating benefits for humans, the so-\n\ncalled \u201cecosystem services\u201d, such as food, fuel, fiber, climate regulation, pest control and \n\ndrinking water. Water, in particular, is a natural resource imperative to life, to the natural cycles \n\nof the organisms, to the food production and the economic activities. This resource, however, \n\nis increasingly scarce due to the crescent demand associated with population growth, increasing \n\nin urbanization, agricultural frontier expansion, and the rapid development of economic \n\nactivities. In addition, the intensification of natural ecosystems degradation is threatening the \n\nprovision of water resources, especially drinking water. \n\nDeclining water quality has become a global issue of concern as industrial and \n\nagricultural activities expand, and climate change threatens to cause serious alterations to the \n\nhydrological cycles. Many areas worldwide are experiencing problems with lack of drinking \n\nwater due to the water bodies\u2019 pollution coming from agricultural runoff, domestic sewage, \n\nindustrial effluents, and atmospheric inputs from fossil fuel burning and bushfires. \n\nLand-use/land-cover composition has a strong influence on the water quality in \n\nwatersheds, wherein different uses represent various degrees of risk to the water resources. The \n\nhydrological cycle and the water behavior reflects the land use, cover and conditions of the \n\ncatchments, wherein surface runoff is a major source of non-point pollution and is primarily \n\nresponsible for the relationship between land use/land cover and water quality. The conversion \n\nof forested areas to other uses, especially, has been associated with water quality deterioration. \n\nHowever, the non-point source water pollution is difficult to control, once it is not caused by \n\nan easily identified and regulated activity. \n\nAgricultural activities are essential for the food provision to the population, feeding \n\nanimals, and biofuel, however, it is one of the main factors of deforestation, especially in \n\ntropical regions. Brazil has reported the greatest annual net loss of forest area in the world due \n\nto agricultural expansion. Cleaning forest areas to acreage expansion for new cultivation areas \n\nand inadequate agricultural practices generate direct and indirect impacts on stream water \n\nquality. Nonetheless, these impacts can vary according to the climate, hydrological \n\ncharacteristics, the region, and the physical aspects of the watershed. \n\nIn this context, watershed management is essential to ensure the water resources \n\nprotection, striking a balance between human activities and natural habitats conservation \n\n\n\n12 \n\nthrough, for example, the maintenance of forest areas within the watersheds. However, many \n\nquestions regarding the relation of forest conservation and water quality have not been resolved. \n\nForest cover in different landscapes can have different impacts on water quality, as well as the \n\nforest configuration. For example, the importance of the riparian forests is often mentioned, but \n\nempirical studies that test its effectiveness in maintaining water clean are scarce and \n\ncontradictory. \n\nWe are facing the challenge of managing the immediate human needs and maintain \n\nlong-term water supply capacity, as concern about the availability of this resource with good \n\nquality. Therefore, the water conservation depends on the conservation of other natural \n\nresources, and it requires plans that incorporate an integrated and holistic view of the ecosystem. \n\nThus, studies that include the knowledge of how and at which scale forest conservation \n\nacts positively on the maintenance of water quality are of utmost importance for the \n\nunderstanding of the ecosystem services provided by the natural habitats in agricultural \n\nwatersheds. This information can help polices design, forest conservation efforts, and forest \n\nrestoration projects. \n\nThis thesis comprises three chapters, which are complete manuscripts that address this \n\nissue. The first chapter gives us an overview of the relation between forest cover and water \n\nquality in agricultural tropical watersheds. The second chapter presents a comparison between \n\nthe effects of land-use/land-cover patterns in the watershed and within the riparian zone on the \n\nwater quality. The third chapter is a next step, where the effects of riparian restoration on water \n\nquality were modeled. Lastly, the final considerations, based on the results from the chapters. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\n2. INFLUENCES OF TROPICAL FOREST COVER ON WATER \n\nQUALITY IN AGRICULTURAL WATERSHEDS IN \n\nSOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL \n\nAbstract \n\nTropical forests are under continued threat due to deforestation and fragmentation, mainly \n\nbecause of clear-cutting for agriculture and cattle ranching, and it can lead to water quality \n\ndegradation. However, there is a need for understanding the role of forest areas in the current diverse \n\nlandscape in tropical watersheds. Thus, this study aimed at evaluating the importance of maintaining \n\nforest cover for water quality in tropical agricultural watersheds. We selected six watersheds of low-\n\norder streams in Southeastern Brazil with different percentages of forest cover, where water samples \n\nwere collected to obtain the following water quality parameters: dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity \n\n(NTU), total suspended solids (TSS), inorganic suspended solids (ISS), organic suspended solids \n\n(OSS), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TN), total coliforms (TC), and fecal coliforms (FC). \n\nA land use/land cover (LULC) map was used to extract the LULC pattern of each watershed, and a \n\ndistance metric was applied to explore the differences between them. The water quality parameters \n\nwere analyzed by the yearly mean, data variation and the correlation between them. We compared \n\nforested (55% of forest cover or more) and degraded (35% or less) watersheds using MANOVA and \n\nPCA. Degraded watersheds showed high values of solids, turbidity, nutrients and coliforms. The \n\nmost forested watershed showed the best water quality, whereas the watershed mainly covered by \n\nagriculture presented the poorest water quality and the greatest temporal variation. The forested \n\nwatersheds showed significant difference with degraded watersheds, which presented higher value \n\nof all the parameters, excepted of DO. NTU, solids, and TP were correlated, showing that turbidity \n\nand solids represent the particles in the water, and they carry adsorbed phosphorus. Those parameters \n\nalso responded to the streamflow variation. The results indicated that water quality degradation is \n\ndue to the agricultural and residential areas, whereas the tropical forest was important to keep water \n\nclean. Thus, tropical forest cover plays an important role in minimizing the impacts of human \n\nactivities on ecosystem services in agricultural watersheds, but better soil management practices and \n\nbasic sanitation implementation are still needed to improve water quality. \n\nKeywords: 1.

Introduction \n\nTropical forests are under severe threat from logging and clearing mainly for \n\nagriculture (WWF, 2011), threatening the ecosystem services that are provided by these areas, \n\nincluding soil and water protection. Although the rate of global forest area net loss has slowed \n\nin the past five years as more forests are better managed, global rates of tropical deforestation \n\nincreased from 5.6 to 9.1 Mha per year over the last two decades, especially in Africa and South \n\nAmerica (WWF, 2011; FAO, 2016). In this context, Brazil reported the greatest annual net loss \n\nof forest area between 2010 and 2015 (FAO, 2016). Atlantic Forest, in particular, is a \n\nbiodiversity hotspot (Mittermeier et al., 2011) that has been reduced to only 11% of its original \n\ncover (Ribeiro et al., 2009). \n\n\n\n14 \n\nAccording to Hosonuma et al. (2012), commercial agriculture is the largest driver of \n\ndeforestation in developing countries, followed by subsistence agriculture. Replacing forest \n\nwith agriculture decreases water quality due to the erosion from croplands, excess amount of \n\nfertilizer and manure applications, higher animal stocking densities, channel erosion, \n\nconstructional activities and wastewater (Ometo et al., 2000; Gergel et al., 2002; Erol and \n\nRandhir, 2013; Gunawardhana et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2016). In this way, keeping forest \n\nareas in agricultural watersheds can control the biogeochemical cycles, providing protection \n\nagainst erosion, retention of pollutants, excessive nutrients runoff and increased water \n\ntemperature (Sweeney et al., 2004; Mingoti and Vettorazzi, 2011; Schilling and Jacobson, \n\n2014; Tanaka et al., 2016). \n\nIt is well accepted that watersheds covered with natural forests mostly provide better \n\nwater quality than watersheds with other land uses. For example, Knee and Encalada (2014) \n\nfound that watersheds that have streams in protected forests tended to have better water quality \n\nthan areas which are not under protection. Wang et al. (2013) associated forestland to good \n\nwater quality comparing to farm and urban lands. Huang et al. (2016) also found that water \n\nquality parameters are strongly positively correlated with the proportion of forest areas. \n\nHowever, tropical forests, including Atlantic Forest, are today a mix of forest at many degrees \n\nof conservation interspersed with patches of agriculture or other uses (Ribeiro et al., 2009; \n\nSingh and Mishra, 2014; Chazdon, 2017). Cl\u00e9ment et al. (2017) also found that the landscape \n\ndiversity appeared to have a negative impact on water quality, and it seems to occur at certain \n\nthresholds. According to the authors, even in areas of intensive farming, streams with a forest \n\narea that covers at least 47% of the watershed have a better water quality than others with fewer \n\nforest areas. Nonetheless, the effects of the forest cover on water quality in tropical watersheds \n\nwith a mixed agricultural landscape have not really been evaluated (Singh and Mishra, 2014).  \n\nWith an expected world population to reach 9.7 billion by 2050 (UN-Water, 2016), \n\nsupplying water becomes a major issue related to drinking water in the world. We currently \n\nface the challenge of supplying the immediate population demands and, at the same time, ensure \n\nthe long-term water supply capacity, assuring quantity and quality of this resource for the future \n\ngenerations. \n\nAccordingly, studies that evaluate how the tropical forests contribute positively to the \n\nwater quality maintenance in the current diverse landscape are needed to help to understand the \n\necosystem services that are provided by the natural vegetation in agricultural watersheds, and \n\nits importance for the population. This information can assist the plans and future actions of \n\nforest conservation and restoration, and to design policies for water sources protection. \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nIn this context, this study aimed at evaluating the importance of maintaining forest \n\ncover for water quality in tropical agricultural watersheds. The specific aims were: (1) to \n\nevaluate the water quality in watersheds with different percentages of forest cover; (2) to \n\nexplore the relationship between forest cover and water quality variability; and (3) to assess the \n\nimportance of forest cover in agricultural watersheds in keeping water clean. \n\n2.2. Materials and Methods \n\n2.2.1. Study area \n\nThe study area is the Sarapu\u00ed River basin that includes six experimental watersheds. \n\nSarapu\u00ed River is a tributary of Tiete River, located in the S\u00e3o Paulo State, southeastern Brazil \n\n(Figure 1), and it supplies four cities, providing water for domestic, agricultural and other \n\npurposes. It was originally covered by Atlantic Forest, where Dense Ombrophilous Forest is \n\nthe predominant forest type (Oliveira-Filho and Fontes, 2000). The forest patches remaining \n\nare within a complex matrix composed by agriculture (at large and small scale), pasture, planted \n\nforest (Eucalyptus and Pinus), and urban areas. Agriculture is the backbone of the economy, \n\nespecially the production of grains, fruits, and vegetables.  \n\nThe region is under the influence of Cwa climate (humid temperate with dry winters). \n\nAnnual precipitation is between 1354.7 mm and 1807.7 mm (CEPAGRI, 2014), and the rain \n\nmostly falls from October to March. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Atlantic Forest distribution and the sampling sites location in the Sarapu\u00ed River basin, S\u00e3o Paulo State, \n\nBrazil. \n\n\n\n16 \n\nSix watersheds (numbered S1 to S6) were selected based on physical characteristics \n\nand percentage of forest cover to establish the sampling sites. We selected watersheds of low-\n\norder streams (3rd order) with similar area, shape, average slope, and soil types, but with \n\nvarying forest cover, including three forested watersheds (more than 55% of forest cover \u2013 S1, \n\nS2 and S5) and three degraded watersheds (35% or less \u2013 S3, S4 and S6). According to Vannote \n\net al. (1980), low-order streams (orders 1-3) are strongly influenced by terrestrial inputs. \n\n2.2.2. Data sources \n\nRiver network and a 5m-resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derived from \n\nofficial topographic information (IGC, 1:10.000 scale) were used to delimit the watersheds. We \n\nemployed the standard tools for hydrology and watershed, which are available in the GIS to \n\ndelineate the six 3rd-order watersheds, basing on the sampling sites and the watershed areas \n\nupstream. \n\nLand-use/land-cover (LULC) data was extracted from SPOT satellite images (2.5m-\n\nspatial resolution; panchromatic band, year: 2010) supplied by the Environment Secretariat of \n\nthe S\u00e3o Paulo State, Environmental Planning Coordination (SMA-CPLA) by on-screen \n\ndigitizing (1:8,000 scale) with ArcGIS 10.2 software. The follow LULC classes were pre-\n\ndefined, based on the technical manual on the land use of the Brazilian Institute of Geography \n\nand Statistics (IBGE, 2013): water, wetlands, forest, eucalyptus, agriculture, pasture and urban. \n\nIn this study, agriculture represents the fast-growing vegetables, e.g. onion, potato, pumpkin, \n\nstrawberry, and lettuce; urban represents the residential areas; pasture comprises grassland \n\ndestined to livestock activity, even without cattle in the studied period; and forest represents the \n\nareas covered by native forest (Atlantic Forest). \n\nThe map accuracy and agreement were measured through the confusion matrix and the \n\nkappa coefficient (Congalton and Green, 1998), based on 121 ground control points distributed \n\nalong the six watersheds. We obtained 105 overall hits, which represents 87% of agreement, \n\nand a kappa coefficient of 0.83, indicating a very good accuracy of the LULC map (Rosner, \n\n2006). \n\nNine water quality parameters, including dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity (NTU), \n\ntotal suspended solids (TSS), inorganic suspended solids (ISS), organic suspended solids \n\n(OSS), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total coliforms (TC), and fecal coliforms \n\n(FC), were chosen to represent the water quality in the sampling sites. The samples were \n\ncollected at bi-weekly intervals during a hydrologic year (from October 2013 to October 2014) \n\nsumming up 24 observations for each site. \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\nDO was measured through an in-situ water quality detector (YSI 556 multiparameter \n\nsystem). Water samples were collected in duplicate to determine NTU, TN, TP, TSS, and OSS, \n\nwhich were kept refrigerated and transported to the laboratory for advanced analysis, following \n\nstandard methods (APHA, 2005).  \n\nNTU was obtained using an automatic turbidimeter (MS TEC \u2013 TB 1000). TN was \n\ndetermined by Kjeldahl digestion method (APHA, 2005) using an automatic digester (Buchi \u2013 \n\nK449). The spectrophotometric determination was applied to measure TP (APHA, 2005). The \n\ngravimetric analysis was used to obtain TSS, ISS and OSS (APHA, 2005), where 500 mL were \n\nfiltrated for each sample. TSS is the total residue portion on the filter, ISS is the total solid \n\nportion that remains after the calcination, and OSS is the portion of the solids that is lost in the \n\ncalcination process. TC and FC were detected by the multiple-tube technique with 100 mL \n\nsample (CETESB, 1993), and the results are given in Most Probable Number (MPN). We used \n\nLactose Broth for the presumptive identification of coliforms, and the Brilliant Green Bile Broth \n\nfor the confirmation and mensuration. \n\n    We also measured the streamflow (Q) using the current-meter method, that divides \n\nthe stream channel cross section into various vertical subsections (Santos et al., 2001). In each \n\nsubsection, the area was obtained by measuring the width and depth, and the water velocity was \n\ndetermined using a current meter (Global Water Flow Probe \u2013 201). The total discharge was \n\ncomputed by summing the discharge of each subsection. \n\n2.2.3. Statistical analyses \n\nWe applied a distance metric (Manhattan distance) to explore the differences in the \n\nLULC patterns between watersheds through the vegan package of the statistical software R (R \n\nDevelopment Core Team, 2014). Manhattan distance between two items is the sum of the \n\nabsolute values of the differences of their corresponding components (Shahid et al., 2009), and \n\nit is calculated by the equation 1. \n\n?(??) = ?(?[??] ? ?[??])\n\n?\n\n?=1\n\n \n\nwhere d is the distance between two watersheds (j and k) and x is the value of the LULC \n\npercentage for each watershed. \n\nMean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation (CV=SD/x.100 %, where SD is \n\nthe standard deviation and x is the mean) were calculated to obtain the water quality variables \n\n(1) \n\n\n\n18 \n\npattern and variation between watersheds. The range of data values was categorized into three \n\nclasses based on the natural breaks method to build a map of the water quality spatial variation. \n\nWe performed a Pearson\u00b4s correlation to check for relations between water quality \n\nvariables. The variables strongly correlated (r > 0.9) were discarded from the next analysis. A \n\nlinear regression was also applied to evaluate the relation between water quality and \n\nstreamflow. The water quality variables were checked for normality and transformed, when it \n\nwas necessary, using logarithm forms. \n\nA multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) using the Hotelling-Lawley Trace \n\nwas employed to check if the water quality was different between forested and degraded \n\nwatersheds. The Hotelling-Lawley Trace is the multivariate equivalent of the t-test, whether the \n\ntwo vectors of means for the two groups (forested and degraded) are sampled from the same \n\nsampling distribution (Carey, 1998). \n\nThe principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to check for groups between \n\nforested and degraded watersheds, also to identify the water quality variables that directed this \n\nresult and the relation between them. \n\nThe statistical analyses were performed using the software RStudio (RStudio Team, \n\n2014) and MVSP 3.22 (Kovach Computing Services, 2007).  \n\n2.3. Results \n\nAmong the forested watersheds, S5 showed the largest forest cover (75%) followed by \n\nS2 (57%) and S1 (55%) (Figure 2). On the other hand, S4, S6, and S3 presented, respectively, \n\n35%, 29%, and 25% of forest cover. Likewise, S4 had the largest agricultural area (54%), \n\nfollowed by S6 (33%), S3 (29%), S1 (27%) and S2 (23%), whereas the S5 had only 16%. S3 \n\nshowed the largest urban area, representing 11,5% of the watershed, whereas the other \n\nwatersheds had less than 5%. \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Percentage of land use/land cover (LULC) of the study sites, in the Sarapu\u00ed basin watershed, S\u00e3o Paulo \n\nState, Brazil. \n\n \n\nIn the same way, the Manhattan distance revealed that the most forested site (S5) is \n\nalso the most distant watershed according to the LULC pattern, followed by S4, which has the \n\nwatershed predominantly covered by agriculture (Table 1). This analysis also indicated that S1 \n\nand S2 had similar LULC pattern, both classified as forested watershed and with a secondary \n\npredominance of agriculture. S3 and S6 also presented short distance between them considering \n\nthe LULC pattern. These watersheds had a close percentage of forest, agriculture, and pasture, \n\nbut they differed in the percentage of urban area (Figure 2). \n\n \n\nTable 1.

Moreover, \n\nit was also the site with the largest temporal variation, with high values of Sd and CV, followed \n\nby S3 and S6.  \n\nS3 was the second watershed with the highest values of nutrients (TN and TP) and \n\ncoliforms (TC and FC), whereas S6 was the second one with highest values of NTU, TSS, ISS \n\nand OSS. In the case of TC and FC, S3 and S4 presented values much higher than the other \n\nsites.  \n\nOn the other hand, S5 showed the best values of water quality parameters, followed \n\nby S1 and S2, respectively.  \n\nConcerning the DO concentration, the watersheds showed mean values above 6mg.L-\n\n1, but S3 was the only watershed which presented samples below 6mg.L-1 (reaching 4.4 mg.L-\n\n1), and it was also the site with the lowest annual mean, whereas S2 showed the highest value \n\n(Table 2). \n\nThere was a correlation between NTU, TSS and ISS (Table 3), because those variables \n\nrepresent the particles in the water. OSS was also related to those variables, but not with the \n\nsame magnitude.  \n\nTable 3.

Moreover, the linear regression \n\nshowed that TSS was the water quality variable more related to streamflow (R2 = 0.21, \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\np<0.0001) (Figure 4), followed by NTU (R2 = 0.19). Although this relation was significant, it \n\nis not high, which denotes that streamflow influenced the water quality, but it alone did not \n\nexplain the water quality variation. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4. Linear regression of total suspended solids (TSS) as function of streamflow (Q) in the Sarapu\u00ed River \n\nbasin, S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil. \n\n \n\nBoth groups (forested and degraded watersheds) showed a significant difference in \n\nwater quality according to the multivariate analysis (Hotelling-Lawley\u00b4s ? = 0.47; F = 5; P = \n\n0.0003), as illustrated in Figure 5.  It is possible to see that, besides DO concentration, degraded \n\nwatersheds showed higher values of the water quality parameters than the forested ones, and \n\nthe greatest temporal variation (Figure 5). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.

The first PCA axis explained \n\n33.3%, where the main variables that drove the separation between forested and degraded \n\nwatersheds were TSS, OSS, TP and FC. Only TN was not correlated with PCA axis 1. The \n\nsecond PCA axis represented 31.8% of the data variability, which means a total of 65.1% of \n\nexplanation. \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.

Discussion \n\nThe LULC patterns indicated that the natural ecosystem, in the study area, was \n\nreplaced by the expansion of production systems as agriculture and livestock (Figure 2), that \n\nwere the primarily responsible for the deforestation of the Atlantic Forest biome (Silva et al., \n\n2016). The reduction of forest cover affects negatively the water quality, once the most forested \n\nwatershed showed the best water quality among the watersheds as shown in Table 2 and Figure \n\n3. \n\nThe two watersheds that had the most different LULC pattern from the others (S5 and \n\nS4) (Table 1) also presented the best and the poorest water quality, respectively (Table 2). It \n\nindicates that the LULC pattern had a significant role in controlling the water quality. Besides \n\nit had the lowest values of pollutants, the most forested watershed (S5) also presented the lowest \n\ntemporal variation, whereas the most agricultural watershed (S4) presented the highest values \n\nof annual average and temporal variation of the water quality parameters (Table 2). \n\nGreat temporal variation in water quality is also an indicative of watershed \n\ndegradation, once during the rainy season, especially in tropical watersheds, the water \n\ndegradation in streams with no forest cover is raised due to the other LULC being more prone \n\n\n\n26 \n\nto direct surface runoff and, consequently, to transfer pollutants into the river. That \n\ndemonstrates how important the Atlantic Forest is for the surface water quality (Pinto et al., \n\n2013; Huang et al., 2013; Ou et al., 2016). According to Baker and Miller (2013), forest cover \n\nin a watershed promotes the decrease in runoff and increase in interception and soil infiltration, \n\nreducing sediment discharge and nutrients and pollutants loading into the river in storm events. \n\nIn this context, our results indicated that NTU and TSS responded to streamflow \n\nvariation (Figure 4) but this relation was not strong, showing that, besides the hydrological \n\ninfluence, the LULC pattern had a great impact on water characteristics. Similarly, Carroll et \n\nal. (2013) and Chea et al. (2016) found that spatial variation (between sites) was greater than \n\nthe temporal variation of water quality. Seasonal variation in precipitation, surface runoff, \n\ninterception, and abstraction have a strong influence on river discharge, and consequently \n\nvariations in water quality (Huang et al., 2016), but these effects are controlled by the LULC \n\npattern, once degraded watersheds showed greater temporal variation (Table 2). \n\nTurbidity and suspended material represent the particles in the water, then it was \n\nexpected that those parameters were correlated, as found by Wang et al. (2013) and \n\nWickramaarachchi et al. (2013). Phosphorus outputs, in turn, are dependent on sediment \n\n(Huang et al., 2016), because it is easily adsorbed on mineral particles (Silva et al., 2009) which \n\nare represented by the correlation between TP and TSS (Table 3). The S4 presented much higher \n\nvalues of those parameters than the other sites, and it can be related to the non-point sources \n\npollution from the agriculture lands. The forest cover of 35% in this watershed was not enough \n\nto control this impact. It was the only stream that reached values close to 100 NTU. \n\nGreat values of NTU lead to the decrease of photosynthesis in the water body, affecting \n\nthe aquatic community, especially in low order streams. The increase of sediment represents an \n\nincrement in nutrients, toxic metals and other pollutants carried by the soil particles (Nasrabadi \n\net al., 2016; Sharma et al., 2017). Throughout the world, the increase in the sediment load of \n\nstreams is one of the major causes of degradation on water quality from agricultural watersheds \n\n(Gonzales-Inca et al., 2015; Restrepo et al., 2015; Crabit et al., 2016). \n\nPhosphorus is usually the most limiting nutrient in freshwater aquatic ecosystems, \n\nleading to eutrophication when it is in excess of what the organisms can use, which is one of \n\nthe most important causes of water degradation (Huang et al., 2016; Sharma et al., 2017). In \n\nthis way, S3 and S4 can face problems due to the high values of TP compared to the other \n\nwatersheds, mostly because of the wastewater from residential areas and runoff from \n\nagricultural lands (Figure 3), the same found by Ding et al. (2013) and Gonzales-Inca et al. \n\n(2015) in agricultural watersheds. In the same way, S3 and S4 showed the highest values of TN \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\n(Table 2 and Figure 3), indicating the water degradation from residential areas without sewage \n\ncollection and excess of fertilizer use in agricultural lands (Calijuri et al., 2015; Gallo et al., \n\n2015; Sharma and Sharma, 2015; Giri and Qiu, 2016). \n\nPhosphorus and nitrogen fertilizers accumulate in agricultural soils, these surplus \n\nfertilizers may either remain in soils or be exported into surface waters by erosion or leaching. \n\nThe use of fertilizers and pesticides is common and, in many cases, intense in the Sarapu\u00ed River \n\nbasin (Schnaider and Costa, 2013). In the S\u00e3o Paulo State, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium \n\nconsumption are 181.7 kg per hectare/year, which is above the national average (IBGE, 2012). \n\nAccording to the Brazil National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA), Brazil represents \n\n86% of the pesticide and fertilizers consumption in Latin American. Examining some of the \n\nwatersheds studied here, Schnaider and Costa (2013) found that almost all the farmers (96%) \n\nuse pesticides for controlling pests, diseases, and invasive plant species and synthetic fertilizers. \n\nThis uncontrolled use of agrochemicals in these watersheds threat the water quality of the \n\nSarapu\u00ed river and its tributary, Pirapora river, that together supply four cities in the region. We \n\ncan see that, even still presenting 35% of forest cover, S4 showed the highest levels of nutrients \n\nin the surface water, which is a result of the agricultural activities in the watershed. \n\n The presence of FC in the water indicates contamination with fecal material of \n\nhumans or other animals from the residential and agricultural areas, wherein domestic sewage \n\nis usually the primary source of FC loading (Reder et al., 2015). Our study area is characterized \n\nby agricultural land comprised of small farms with isolated houses also without sewage \n\ncollection, where the contaminants from the wastewater are directed discarded on the soil or \n\ninto the river (Costa et al., 2011). Therefore, the residential areas and agricultural lands in S3 \n\nand S4 were responsible for the highest values of FC (Table 2), following the pattern found for \n\nnutrients. According to the CONAMA Framework Resolution 357/2005 that fixed the \n\nconditions for establishing water quality categories in Brazilian aquatic systems to human use, \n\nS3 is classified as Class 2, and S4 as Class 3, which request a more complex water treatment \n\nthan rivers classified as Class 1. \n\n  Although it does not affect the drinking water quality directly as the other water \n\nquality parameters here, DO is one of the most important water characteristics for the biological \n\nintegrity of the aquatic environment, and it affects the chemical reactions that occur within the \n\nwater body (Brooks et al., 2003). In this study, almost all the streams maintained good values \n\nof DO concentration except S3, which reached values above 5 mg.L-1. According to Welch and \n\nLindell (2004), warm water (tropic rivers) requires DO levels of at least 5 mg.L-1 to sustain fish \n\n\n\n28 \n\npopulations. These low values of DO concentration in the S3 can be related to the eutrophication \n\nprocess due to the wastewater coming from the urban area, but also to its low streamflow \n\nregistered during the year, once DO is directly associated with streamflow (Uriarte et al., 2011). \n\nThe human activities, in this case, can be responsible also for the alterations in water yield, \n\naffecting the mixing processes that contribute to water aeration.     \n\nWe highlight that, even presenting agriculture areas, the forested watersheds showed \n\nbetter water quality than degraded watersheds, indicating the importance of the forest cover for \n\nthese systems to minimize sediments, nutrients and coliforms loads into the river, as shown by \n\nthe results of Hotelling-Lawley Test (Figure 4), providing drinking water and simplifying the \n\nwater treatment for water supply. On the other hand, the forest cover below 35% in the degraded \n\nwatersheds was not enough to reduce the pollutants as it was for the watersheds predominantly \n\nforested (55% or more). Ding et al. (2013) pointed out that the water quality in stream \n\ncatchments is severely influenced by the non-point source pollution resulting from farmland \n\nand residential land in agriculture watersheds, whereas forest can effectively mitigate water \n\nquality degradation. Knee and Encalada (2014) stated that forested streams consistently have \n\nthe lowest pollutant concentration in a rural tropical forest region similar to our study area. \n\nAccordingly, degraded watersheds were grouped due to the higher values of TSS, \n\nOSS, TP and FC (Figure 5), whereas forested watersheds were associated with high values of \n\nDO, the same pattern found by Huang et al. (2016) using PCA analysis. Thus, mechanisms such \n\nas better soil management practices in agriculture, forest cover restoration projects, and riparian \n\nvegetation restoration efforts are some of the essential steps needed to improve water quality in \n\nagricultural watersheds, decreasing the runoff, sediment losses, and loading rates of nutrients \n\nand coliforms (Gunawardhana et al., 2016). \n\nSecond, it might also be considered that wastewater from the residential and \n\nagricultural lands was combined with the pollutants from the croplands, which aggravated the \n\nwater quality deterioration. It is important to control the point source pollution of wastewater \n\nfrom these areas. Therefore, parallel to forest restoration plans, there is a needed for the \n\nimplementation of basic sanitation in this region, avoiding the sewage disposal on the soil and \n\ninto the river, which is still a huge problem in tropical areas like South America and Africa \n\n(UNICEF and WHO, 2015). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\n2.5. Conclusion \n\nWatersheds predominantly covered by forest have lower pollutant concentration than \n\nwatersheds primarily covered by other uses. Forest cover has influence in reducing sediment, \n\nnutrients, and coliforms loads into the river. On the other hand, degraded watersheds, especially \n\nthose covered by agricultural and urban lands, present the highest values of pollutants and the \n\ngreatest temporal variance of water quality parameters, which is also an indicative of human \n\nimpact. \n\nBesides de LULC impact on water quality, stream flow also contributes to its variation, \n\nincreasing turbidity, sediments and phosphorus in storm events.  \n\nOur findings suggest that the impacts sources on water quality in agricultural \n\nwatersheds mainly come from runoff from croplands and residential wastewater, wherein the \n\ntropical forest cover plays an important role in minimizing the impacts of human activities on \n\nwatershed ecosystem services. \n\nForest restoration, better soil management practices, basic sanitation implementation, \n\nand point source poluttion control are all needed to improve water quality in tropical agricultural \n\nwatersheds. \n\n \n\nReferences \n\nAPHA: American Public Health Association, 2005.

EFFECTS OF LAND USE/LAND COVER ON WATER QUALITY OF \n\nLOW-ORDER STREAMS IN SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL: \n\nWATERSHED VERSUS RIPARIAN ZONE \n\nAbstract \n\nNatural habitats conversion into agricultural and urban lands is one of the major factors of \n\nwater quality degradation. Especially in low-order streams, water quality is strongly influenced by \n\nthe land-use/ land-cover (LULC) pattern. However, this relation may be different for various water \n\nquality parameters at different spatial scales. Here, we evaluated the LULC effects on water quality \n\nof low-order streams, comparing the watershed and riparian zone influences, to identify the key \n\nfactors determining water quality variability. We collected water samples in low-order streams in \n\nBrazil to obtain data of nutrients, sediments and fecal coliforms. We also used streamflow, \n\nprecipitation and temperature data. The water quality parameters were analyzed separately and \n\ntogether by statistical models and multivariate analysis. We also investigated the influence of the \n\nseasonal effect. The results indicated that the forest cover plays an important role in keeping water \n\nclean, while agriculture and urban areas lead the water quality degradation. Pasture had mixed \n\neffects, but in general was not correlated with poor water quality, once the livestock activities are \n\nnot intensive in the area. Dissolved oxygen, total phosphorus, total suspended solids and fecal \n\ncoliforms responded better to the LULC composition within the watershed, while total nitrogen and \n\norganic matter were more affected by the landscape composition in the riparian zone. Besides the \n\nspatial variation, the water quality also varies with seasonal changes, especially with streamflow and \n\ntemperature variability. The overall water quality variation is explained better by the LULC \n\ncomposition within the watershed than in the riparian zone. It suggests that the water management \n\nand forest restoration planning need to adopt a multi-scale perspective, but the actions must be \n\ndirected to the whole watershed, not only to the riparian zone. Although the importance of the \n\nriparian zone, the watershed management in the low-order streams is extremely necessary for the \n\nwater quality maintenance, aiming at the water resources conservation downstream. \n\nKeywords: 1.

Introduction \n\nNatural habitats conversion into anthropogenic landscapes due to the increasing \n\nhuman demand for resources is one of the main factors behind the alterations on water quality \n\n(Giri and Qiu, 2016; Su et al., 2016). Agricultural and urban lands increase has been described \n\nas one of the greatest contributors to the increment of nutrients and sediments in freshwater \n\necosystems worldwide (Uriarte et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2016). However, non-point sources \n\npollution is tough to identify due to the complex and diffuse nature of the interaction between \n\nhydrologic and landscape patterns (Chiwa et al., 2012). Also, the relationship between land \n\nuse/land cover (LULC) and water quality can occur at different spatial scales, from local to \n\nregional effects (Wang et al., 2013; Tanaka et al., 2016). \n\n\n\n38 \n\nLow-order streams (1st to 3rd order) dominate the riverine landscape and they \n\nmaintain the function, health, and biodiversity of entire river networks (Vannote et al., 1980; \n\nWipfli et al.; 2007). According to Vannote et al. (1980), they are strongly influenced by \n\nterrestrial inputs, which makes them fragile ecosystems, which can suffer dramatic impact from \n\nland-use changes. \n\nThe relationship between LULC and water quality in low-order streams, despite its \n\nimportance for the watershed, it is not well documented (Ding et al., 2016). It is crucial to \n\nunderstand those interactions in low-order streams once they are responsible for the water, \n\norganic matter, sediments and nutrients transportation downstream (Gomi, 2002). \n\nIn this way, the riparian zones can play an important role in maintaining water quality, \n\nonce they represent the aquatic-terrestrial ecotone. Riparian zones exert important influences \n\non the waterways by mediating the bi-directional flow of matter and energy between the water \n\nbody and the surrounding hinterland (Hanser et al., 2010). For example, the riparian forest can \n\nreduce nitrates, phosphorus, and sediment loading into the river (Krutz et al., 2005; Oliveira et \n\nal., 2010; Batson et al., 2012; Saalfeld et al., 2012; Gonzales-Inca et al., 2015; Ou et al., 2016) \n\nand it can also influence the energy balance (Tanaka et al., 2016). Replacing riparian forest by \n\nother land-cover types leads to a decrease in water quality due to the bank erosion, consequently \n\nincreasing nutrient and sediment loads into the river (Ding et al., 2013, Ou et al., 2016; Yang \n\net al., 2016). \n\nSome studies have shown that LULC is a better predictor of water quality in the \n\nriparian zone than within the watershed (Tran et al., 2010; Shen et al., 2015), while others have \n\nfound that the LULC patterns at the watershed scale better account for the variability in river \n\nwater quality (Zhou et al., 2012; Ding et al., 2016). Uriarte et al. (2011) and Tanaka et al. (2016) \n\nalso mentioned that the water quality indicators had presented different response for LULC \n\npatterns, when they were evaluated at different spatial scales. Consequently, authors have \n\nhighlighted the importance of the multiscale analysis, specially, aiming at the understanding of \n\nthe impacts of LULC on water quality (Uriarte et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2012; Tanaka et al., \n\n2016). \n\nIn this context, this study aimed at to evaluate the land-use/land-cover (LULC) effects \n\non water quality of low-order streams, comparing the watershed and the riparian zone \n\ninfluences. The specific objectives were: (1) to identify the key factors that influence the water \n\nquality variability; (2) to evaluate the relationship between LULC patterns and water quality \n\nwithin the whole watershed and in the riparian zone; (3) to identify which LULC pattern has \n\nthe strongest influence on water quality in low-order streams. \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2. Material and Methods \n\n3.2.1.  Study area \n\nThe study area is the Sarapu\u00ed River basin located in the S\u00e3o Paulo State, southeastern \n\nBrazil (Figure 1). The Sarapu\u00ed River is a tributary of Tiete River, and it supplies four cities in \n\nthe State, providing water for domestic, agricultural and other purposes.  \n\nMost of the soil types in the Sarapu\u00ed River basin are red or yellow tropical soils, mainly \n\nLatosols, and low-activity clays predominate (Oliveira et al., 1999; Coelho et al., 2003). The \n\nwatershed was originally covered by Atlantic Forest, with Dense Ombrophilous Forest as the \n\npredominant forest type, which has been replaced by agriculture, pasture, eucalyptus and urban \n\nareas. Agriculture is the backbone of the economy, especially the production of grains, fruits \n\nand vegetables. \n\nThe region is under the influence of Cwa climate (humid temperate with dry winters), \n\nwith the annual precipitation between 1354.7 mm and 1807.7 mm (CEPAGRI, 2014), and the \n\nrain mostly falling from October to March. \n\nSix 3rd-order streams (numbered S1 to S6) were selected with similar area, shape, \n\naverage-slope and soil types, but with different LULC patterns. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Study area location and sampling sites in the Sarapu\u00ed River basin, S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil.  \n\n \n\n\n\n40 \n\n3.2.2.  Conceptual approach \n\nThe conceptual approach for this study includes the LULC types within the watershed \n\nand riparian zone, water quality data, streamflow and, water temperature data. All data were \n\nused to build statistical models for each water quality parameter and a multivariate analysis \n\nintegrating all the water quality parameters (Figure 2). \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Conceptual approach used in this study. \n\n \n\n3.2.3. Watershed and riparian zone delineation \n\nMap manipulations and spatial analysis were performed using the Geographical \n\nInformation System (GIS) ArcGIS 10.2. \n\nRiver network and a 5m-resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derived from \n\nofficial topographic information (IGC, 1:10,000 scale) were used to delimit the watersheds. We \n\nemployed the standard tools for hydrology and watershed, which are available in the GIS to \n\ndelineate the six 3rd-order watersheds, basing on the sampling sites and the watershed areas \n\nupstream. \n\nWe adopted the Permanent Preservation Area (PPA), according to the Brazilian Forest \n\nCode (Brasil, 2012), as riparian zone. Therefore, we established a 30m buffer along the river \n\nnetworks, and a 50m buffer around springs. \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\n3.2.4.  Land-use/land-cover maps \n\nThe watershed LULC maps were obtained by on-screen digitizing (1:8,000 scale) of \n\nSPOT images (2.5m-spatial resolution; panchromatic band, year: 2010), that were supplied by \n\nthe Environment Secretariat of the S\u00e3o Paulo State, Environmental Planning Coordination \n\n(SMA-CPLA). \n\nThe follow LULC classes were pre-defined, basing on the technical manual on land \n\nuse of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE, 2013): water, wetlands, forest, \n\neucalyptus, agriculture, pasture and urban. \n\nIn this study, agriculture represents the fast-growing vegetables (short cycle crops), \n\ne.g. onion, potato, pumpkin, strawberry, and lettuces. Urban represents the residential areas, \n\nonce there are no large cities or industrial areas in the study area. Pasture comprises grassland \n\ndestined to livestock activity, even without cattle in the studied period. Forest represents the \n\nareas covered by native forest (Atlantic Forest). \n\nThe map accuracy and the agreement were measured through the confusion matrix and \n\nthe kappa coefficient (Congalton and Green, 1998), based on 121 ground control points \n\ndistributed along the six watersheds. We obtained 105 overall hits, which represent 87% of \n\nagreement, and a kappa coefficient of 0.83, indicating a very good accuracy of the LULC map \n\n(Rosner, 2006). \n\nThe LULC eucalyptus, water, and wetlands were not used in the models, due their low \n\nincidence in the watersheds. \n\n3.2.5. Water sampling and measurement \n\n The following water quality indicators were chosen to represent impacts \n\nproduced by anthropogenic activities: dissolved oxygen (DO), total nitrogen (TN), total \n\nphosphorus (TP), total suspended solids (TSS), organic suspended solids (OSS), and fecal \n\ncoliforms (FC). The samples were collected at bi-weekly intervals from October 2013 to \n\nOctober 2014 for the six watersheds, when we also measured the temperature (T) and \n\nstreamflow (Q). \n\nDO and T were measured through an in-situ water quality detector (YSI 556 \n\nmultiparameter system). Water samples were collected in duplicate to determine TN, TP, TSS \n\nand OSS, which were kept refrigerated and transported to the laboratory for advanced analysis, \n\nfollowing standard methods (APHA, 2005). TN was determined by Kjeldahl digestion method, \n\nTP by spectrophotometry, and TSS and OSS by using gravimetric analysis (APHA, 2005). FC \n\n\n\n42 \n\nwere detected by the multiple-tube technique (CETESB, 1993), and the results are given in \n\nMost Probable Number (MPN). \n\n Q was measured using the current-meter method, which divides the stream \n\nchannel cross section into numerous vertical subsections (Santos et al., 2001). In each \n\nsubsection, the area was obtained by measuring the width and depth, and the water velocity was \n\ndetermined using a current meter (Global Water Flow Probe \u2013 201). The total discharge was \n\ncomputed by summing the discharge of each subsection.  \n\n The daily precipitation data for the study period were obtained from our own \n\nWeather Station (Davis Vantage Pro2) close to the Itupararanga Reservoir. \n\n3.2.6. Data analysis \n\nThe variables were checked for normality and transformed, when it was necessary, \n\nusing logarithm forms. We applied Pearson\u00b4s correlation to determine the strength and \n\ndirections of the relationships between LULC patterns and the individual water quality \n\nparameters. \n\nA multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) using the Hotelling-Lawley Trace \n\nwas used to check differences between rainy (October \u2013 March) and dry season (April \u2013 \n\nSeptember). \n\nAfter this preliminary analysis, we performed separate generalized linear mixed \n\nmodels (Zuur et al., 2009), to obtain the optimal equation for each water quality parameter \n\nthrough the lme4 package of the statistical software R (R Development Core Team, 2014). \n\nFirstly, we performed, for the riparian zone and watersheds, a full model for each water quality \n\nparameter, including the water quality parameters as dependent variables and, as predictors, the \n\npercentage of forest, pasture, agriculture and urban cover types. Based on previous findings, \n\nmodels also included Q as predictor and T as covariate to include the season effect (McDowell \n\nand Asbury 1994; Uriarte et al., 2011). Watershed and time (monthly) were used as random \n\ncomponents. We also tested a 3-day and a 7-day precipitation period prior to each water quality \n\nsampling, in order to predict streamflow. \n\nThe Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) were \n\nused for model selection (Akaike, 1998). The backwards stepwise removal of predictors was \n\nemployed to assess which individual predictors were important drivers for each water quality \n\nparameters. The final models were selected based on the lowest value of AIC and BIC, but only \n\npredictors with significance level of 0.05 were considered. \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\nA Pearson\u2019s correlation between the LULC types was used to avoid variables strongly \n\ncorrelated. The forest cover was not included as predictor in the final model because it was \n\nstrongly negatively correlated with the other LULC types. \n\nWe calculated model goodness of fit as the proportion of explained variance (R2) using \n\nthe method described by Xu (2003), that computes the residual variance of the full model \n\nagainst the residual variance of a fixed intercept-only null model. \n\nThe redundancy analysis (RDA), which is an extension of multiple regression to model \n\nmultivariate response data (Zuur et al., 2007), was applied to evaluate the global descriptions \n\nabout the influences of LULC pattern on water quality, considering the watershed and riparian \n\nzone. The RDA is a form of constrained ordination that examines how much of the variation in \n\nthe set of independent variables explains the variation in the set of dependent variables. This \n\nanalysis allowed us to simultaneously examine the influences of the LULC types on all of the \n\nwater quality parameters. For this analysis, the logarithm transformation was applied for the \n\nannual average of each water quality parameter. A Monte Carlo permutation test (999 \n\npermutations) was used to determine the statistical validity of the RDA. We used the RDA \n\nfunction in the vegan package of the statistical software R. \n\nAll the statistical analyses were performed using the software RStudio (RStudio Team, \n\n2014).  \n\n3.3. Results \n\n3.3.1.  Land use/land cover composition \n\nThe proportion of forest cover at the watershed scale was greater than land uses in S1, \n\nS2, and S5, wherein the last one showed the greatest forest cover (75%), followed by S2 (57%) \n\nand S1 (55%) (Figure 3 and Table 1). \n\nConversely, S4, S6 and S3 presented, respectively, 35%, 29%, and 25% of forest cover \n\nin the watershed. Likewise, S4 had the largest agricultural area (54%), followed by S6 (33%), \n\nS3 (29%), S1 (27%) and S2 (23%), while the S5 had only 16%. S6 and S3 presented the highest \n\nvalues of pastureland (32% and 28%), S1 and S2 showed similar values of pasture cover \n\n(between 11% and 12%), while S4 and S5 had only 3%. S3 showed the largest urban area, \n\nrepresenting 11,5% of the watershed. \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.

S1 and S2 showed the lowest value of agriculture in the riparian zone (between 6% and 8%). \n\nS4 showed the highest value for agricultural lands (26%) and S3 for urban areas (10%), the \n\nsame pattern from the LULC within the entire watershed. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \nTable 1.

Consequently, the agriculture class revealed isolated houses (Figure 4). The predominant \n\nfast growing vegetables found in the study area were onion, potato, pumpkin, cucumber, leek, \n\nstrawberry, artichoke, and lettuce. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.

Impacts of land use/land cover on water quality \n\nWater quality parameters were correlated with LULC patterns in accordance with the \n\nresults of Pearson\u2019s correlation (Table 2), and mixed models (Table 3). \n\nForest cover was the main land cover associated with good water quality, while urban \n\nand agricultural lands were related to water quality degradation, considering both, watershed \n\nand riparian zone. After forest cover, the next LULC type that showed the lowest impact on \n\nwater quality was pasture. \n\nThe proportion of forest cover was positively correlated with DO and negatively \n\ncorrelated with solids (TSS and OSS), TP, TN and FC within the watershed and riparian zone. \n\nAlthough, the correlation between forest and DO was strongest at the riparian zone. Conversely, \n\nurban area was negatively correlated with DO and positively with the other parameters. \n\nAgriculture was positively correlated with solids, TP, TN and FC, but also with DO at the \n\nwatershed scale. \n\nTable 2.

Almost all \n\nthe models for water quality included streamflow as predictor (Table 3), showing that water \n\nquality parameters varied with changes in water discharge. This variable showed a better \n\nprediction than previous precipitation in the models. Temperature was also a predictor for DO \n\nand TN for both the watershed and for the riparian zone models. \n\nW\na\nte\n\nrs\nh\ne\nd\n\n \n\n \n\nR\nip\n\na\nri\n\na\nn\n \n\nz\no\n\nn\ne\n \n\n \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\nThe models explained 49% to 72% of the observed variance in water quality \n\nparameters (Table 3). Those parameters showed different responses related to both the whole \n\nwatershed and the riparian zone. In the case of DO, TSS, TP and FC, they ca be explained by \n\nthe proportion of LULC at the whole watershed. On the other hand, models that considered \n\nLULC in the riparian zone were better predictors of in-stream concentration of TN and OSS. \n\n  \n\nTable 3.

Concerning the other LULC types, the proportion of forest \n\nincreases the DO concentration, while it decreases with pasture. The watershed model also \n\nconsidered agriculture as a predictor of increase of DO. This water quality parameter responded \n\nbetter to the composition of LULC in the whole watershed than the riparian zone. As expected, \n\nDO concentrations increased with streamflow and decreased with temperature (Table 3). \n\nSimilarly, the parameters TSS, TP, and FC also showed better response for the LULC \n\ncomposition in the whole watershed, wherein agriculture was the most important predictor of \n\nthe increase of those variables, followed by urbanization. Inversely, forest cover represented \n\ndecrease of them. Not surprisingly, TSS increased with streamflow, as well as TP. However, \n\nstreamflow did not represent relation with FC variation. \n\nThe LULC in the riparian zone were better predictors of TN and OSS concentrations. \n\nUrban areas in the riparian zone were the most important LULC type for the increase in TN, \n\nand agriculture was also important for the input of OSS. We can also highlight two results, that \n\nwatersheds covered by forest presented lower levels of TN than the others, and that TN and \n\n\n\n48 \n\nOSS showed negative relation with pasture. In the case of TN concentration, it decreases with \n\nthe increase of temperature, but decreases with rise in streamflow. \n\nThe RDA results showed that, considering all the water quality parameters \n\nsimultaneously, the variation was better explained by LULC composition within the whole \n\nwatershed than by the riparian zone configuration (Figure 5). The first canonical axis (Figure \n\n5) explained the most of the water quality variation. In this scenario, the RDA model explained \n\n82% of the variation for the whole watershed and 75% for the riparian zone composition. \n\nConsidering the LULC in the watershed, the first axis separated sites with the highest \n\npercentage of agriculture and urban lands (S3 and S4) from those with the highest forest cover \n\n(S5, S1 and S2) (Figure 5.A). This first axis consistently displayed a water degradation gradient, \n\nwhere sediments, nutrients and fecal coliforms were negatively correlated with forest cover and \n\nthey were also positively correlated with urban and agricultural lands. It is possible to note that \n\nS5, which has the highest forest cover than the other sites, was associated with the best water \n\nquality. On the other hand, S3 and S4, which have the highest percentages of urban and \n\nagriculture areas, respectively, were associated with poor water quality. Although it has not an \n\nextensive forest cover, S6 did not show the same pattern as S3 and S4. This watershed presents \n\nthe highest percentage of pasture between the sites. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.

Where: Agri = Agriculture, Past = Pasture, Urb = Urban, For = Forest, DO = dissolved oxygen, \n\nTSS = total suspended solids, OSS = organic suspended solids, TN = total nitrogen, TP = total phosphorus, and \n\nFC = fecal coliforms. \n\n \n\n3.4. Discussion  \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\nThe LULC maps indicated that some watersheds are predominantly covered by \n\nagriculture and pasturelands due to the agricultural occupation process that occurred in this \n\nregion (Schneider and Costa, 2013). The S4 is an example with more than 50% of the watershed \n\ncovered by agriculture. Vettorazzi and Valente (2016) also observed that watersheds which \n\nsuffered an increase in agricultural areas had a drastic reduction of forest cover. This fact is not \n\nsuitable for the water quality conservation, once the reduction of forest cover and the increase \n\nin agricultural activities lead to a rise in sediments and nutrients loading into the river (Table \n\n2). \n\nConversely, the studied sites presented their riparian zone with a higher percentage of \n\nforest than the whole watershed, reflecting the efforts of conservation of riparian zones, and \n\nalso the difficulty in expanding agricultural activities over those areas due to the steep relief or \n\npredominance of wetlands (Mello et al., 2014). \n\nThe forest cover, both for watershed and for riparian zone, was related to good water \n\nquality, and it plays a major role in keeping water clean in different watersheds in the world \n\n(FAO, 2008; Wang et al., 2013; Oliveira et al., 2016). Precisely, because sediments, nutrients, \n\nand fecal coliforms were positively related to the agricultural and urban uses and negatively to \n\nforest cover. Studies have shown that agriculture and urban areas represent the most important \n\nLULC that induce the water quality degradation (Zhou et al., 2012; Ding et al., 2016; Huang et \n\nal., 2016; Ou et al., 2016). In the agricultural lands, excessive fertilizers, runoff and soil erosion \n\nled to the increase in sediment, nutrients, chemical contaminants, and organic matter into the \n\nwater body (Poudel, 2016). In urban areas, the increase of wastewater and pollutants accumulate \n\non the impervious surfaces resulting in the water deterioration (Lee et al., 2009; Ding et al. \n\n2016), and although small in percent coverage, it exerts a disproportionately large influence on \n\nwater quality (Zhou et al. 2012), \n\nIn our study, urban use is composed of residential areas and agriculture comprises \n\nsmall farms, and they represent the most important vectors of water degradation, as found by \n\nDing et al. (2013) and Gunawardhana et al. (2016). On the other hand, forest cover behaves as \n\na filter, controlling and decreasing the sediment and pollutants, that are carried in surface runoff \n\n(Ding et al., 2013), also increasing DO concentration (Table 2 and Figure 5). \n\nUnlike other studies that showed negative impacts of the pasture on water quality \n\n(Uriarte et al., 2011; Tanaka et al., 2016; Ou et al., 2016), our results did not associate this land \n\nuse with water degradation for most of the water quality parameters. Pasture only had an \n\nadverse impact on DO. Ding et al. (2013) and Wang et al. (2013) also found a positive \n\n\n\n50 \n\ncorrelation between water quality and grassland, which means that both forest and grassland \n\ncan effectively mitigate water quality degradation (Wang et al., 2013; Ding et al., 2013; Ding \n\net al., 2016). It is important to note that our study area do not have large cattle ranches, and \n\nmany of those areas are abandoned pasture lands. In this way, adverse impacts from the \n\npresence of the animals on the water quality may not occur in the same magnitude as found by \n\nother studies. According to Latawiec (2015), the low-productivity pasturelands with few cattle \n\nare a great opportunity for forest restoration in the tropical agricultural landscapes. The increase \n\nin pasture productivity could provide new areas of land for restored forest. \n\nBesides the spatial variation in water quality, we also observed a temporal variation \n\nlinked to the seasonal changes. According to Huang et al. (2016), seasonal variations in \n\nprecipitation surface runoff, interception, and abstraction have a strong influence on river \n\ndischarge and, consequently, variations in sediment and nutrient concentrations are a seasonal \n\nphenomenon. Oliveira et al. (2016) highlighted that in regions with a well-defined rainy season, \n\nlike many parts of Brazil, the non-point pollution sources usually have a reduced effect on the \n\nstream water quality due to the decrease in runoff during the dry season. Thereat, the addition \n\nof temporal and hydrological data was essential to determine the effect of the landscape pattern \n\non water quality in the region. \n\nThe percentages of forest, agriculture and urban lands were the most important LULC \n\nthat explain the spatial variations of water quality parameters (Table 3), wherein urbanization \n\nand agriculture were the main predictors of the increase of water quality parameters. Recent \n\nstudies also showed a reduction of independent variables of the models with LULC class mainly \n\nbecause of the existing collinearity between the LULC classes (Gonzales-Inca et al., 2015; Li \n\net al., 2015; Oliveira et al., 2016). According to Oliveira et al. (2016), this approach allows to \n\neasily identify the main classes responsible for the variations in water quality. \n\nOur results showed that DO concentration responded better to LULC within the \n\nwatershed than in the riparian zone, and the forested watersheds have the highest values for \n\nDO, alike found by Uriarte et al. (2011) and Ding et al. (2016). However, the correlation \n\nanalysis showed that the riparian forest had an important role in increasing DO concentration, \n\nwhich is greater than we had considered for the forest in the whole watershed. According to \n\nAbell and Allan (2001), forested streams have cooler water and higher oxygen concentration \n\nlevels. DO concentration was negatively correlated with temperature, once the DO demand \n\nincreases with the increase in temperature, while the oxygen solubility in the water decreases \n\n(Manahan, 2004). Thus, the negative impact of pasture on DO can be connected to the fact that \n\nthese lands led to an increase of water temperature. The discharge of organic matter into the \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n\nwater body from urban areas also leads to low DO concentrations, especially in areas that do \n\nnot have sewage collection and treatment (Calijuri et al., 2015). On the other hand, increasing \n\nstreamflow raises the water oxygenation, which can occur in agricultural areas (Uriarte et al., \n\n2011; Wang et al., 2013). \n\nThe results also indicated that TP and TSS were strongly explained by the LULC \n\ncomposition in the watershed and weakly in the riparian zone, and it was the same pattern found \n\nby Uriarte et al. (2011) and Ding et al. (2016). We can highlight, in this context, that agriculture \n\nrepresented the main source of sediments and phosphorus, followed by urban land. The \n\nsuspended solids reflect the intense agricultural activity, where the farmers do not implement \n\nconservation practices, which leaves the soil constantly exposed and subject to erosion, as so \n\nfound by Calijuri et al. (2015). Also, the hill slopes in the study area can enhance the huge soil \n\nerosion from the exposed soil, as pointed by Sharma and Sharma (2015) on watersheds covered \n\nby shifting cultivation. \n\nThe parameters TP and TSS also increased with stream discharge. In rain events, the \n\nsoil erosion is potentiated, and sediments with nutrients are transported into the river (Poudel, \n\n2016). In this way, this study highlighted that the agricultural practices in fast-growing \n\nvegetable crops need to adopt strategies to minimize soil erosion and runoff. \n\nFC were also better explained by the percentage of agriculture and urban area in the \n\nwatershed, what is common in the literature, specially linked to human activities and animal \n\nwaste (Meays et al., 2004). However, in our study, they were much more correlated to \n\nagriculture than with urbanization and, it can be related with the fact that agriculture represents, \n\nin the sites, higher percentage of the landscape than urban areas (Ou et al., 2016). In addition, \n\nthe agricultural lands in the study area are comprised of small farms with isolated houses \n\nwithout sewage collection (Costa et al., 2011). The sewage is often discharged directly into the \n\nwatercourse, on the soil or in a cesspit without structure to avoid soil and groundwater \n\ncontamination, called \u201cblack cesspit\u201d, a common problem in rural areas in Brazil (Pinto et al., \n\n2012). It brings the importance of the basic sanitation services in rural areas, and the biodigester \n\nhas been an alternative in some agricultural watersheds in Brazil (Costa and Guilhoto, 2014). \n\nContrary to the other water quality parameters, TN and OSS were stronger correlated \n\nwith the LULC composition in the riparian zone than in the watershed (Table 3), where \n\nagriculture and urban areas were responsible for the in-stream nitrogen and organic matter, and \n\nforest cover represents decrease in these parameters. Sewage from domestic and food \n\nprocessing sources contains a wide variety of pollutants, including organic pollutants \n\n\n\n52 \n\n(Manahan, 2004). In the same way, Gonzales-Inca et al. (2015) found that riparian vegetation \n\nis important explaining nitrate concentrations due to its potential of nutrient pollution mitigation \n\nin agricultural watersheds. The nitrogen cycle is complex, and it depends on many factors \n\nwithin the aquatic, terrestrial and aerial environment (Manahan, 2004). This chemical element \n\nis in constant transformation and it is used by many organisms in the waterbody and in the \n\nriparian ecosystem (microorganisms and plants) (Wetzel, 1993; Brooks et al., 2003). Due to \n\nthese characteristics, it is understandable that our riparian zone model presented better results \n\nthan the model for the watershed. OSS represents the organic matter in the water, and it is also \n\nstrongly linked to the riparian composition and its interaction with the aquatic ecosystem \n\n(Wetzel, 1993). \n\nAs expected, NT concentration in the water decreases with the increase in temperature, \n\nbecause the microorganisms\u2019 activities in the water and soil are affected by temperature (Mello \n\net al., 1983; Wetzel, 1993). However, in contrast to other studies that showed a positive relation \n\nbetween streamflow and nitrogen (Uriarte et al., 2011), our study showed a negative relation. \n\nThe dilution effect played an important role for the sampling sites located in small watersheds, \n\nwhich means abundant discharge reduced the concentration of TN, as it was so pointed by Wang \n\net al. (2013). According to Dellagiustina (2000) and Gallo et al. (2015), the agricultural \n\nactivities may be not enough to overcome the dilution effect of the precipitation events. Gallo \n\net al. (2015) also pointed out that these sites are more sensitive to shifts in hydrologic \n\npartitioning in response to land-cover change than those associated with climate change. \n\nConcerning the RDA results, we ascertained that the LULC pattern at watershed was \n\nbetter than at riparian zone when it was related to the overall water quality variation as found \n\nby Ding et al. (2016) and Gonzales-Inca et al. (2015) for low-order streams. However, the \n\nmixed models showed that different parameters of water quality varied in their responsiveness \n\nto the different scales when analyzed separately, as reported elsewhere (Uriarte et al., 2011; \n\nZhou et al., 2012). This multiplicity point of view suggests that the water management and \n\nforest restoration planning need to adopt a multi-scale perspective, but the actions must be \n\ndirected to the whole watershed. Although the confirmed importance of the riparian zone, our \n\nstudy demonstrates that the watershed management in low-order streams is extremely necessary \n\nfor the water quality maintenance. \n\nIt is important to note that our study considered a 30m-riparian buffer along rivers and \n\n50m-spring buffer as riparian zone (PPA) following the Brazilian law. Ou et al. (2016), studying \n\nthe influence of the buffer zone width on water quality, highlighted that the 50m-riparian zone \n\naccounts for a low proportion of the whole watershed area, which weakens at this scale the \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \n\ninfluence of landscape features on river conditions. The authors found that the 100m-riparian \n\nzone had the largest effect on river water quality. It brings the question about the effectiveness \n\nof the 30m-buffer for the water sources conservation. In our study, the forest conservation and \n\nthe anthropic activities at the watershed scale in general had greater importance for the water \n\nquality maintenance than the 30m-riparian zone. The studies which reported that the LULC \n\npattern in the riparian zone plays greater importance than the LULC within the watershed used \n\ndifferent buffer widths. For example, Tran et al. (2010) considered 200m of riparian zone along \n\nthe rivers in USA, while Shen et al. (2015) considered a buffer zone of 100m in China. \n\nDing et al. (2016) highlight that opposite results in studies regarding the LULC impact \n\non water quality might be because different methods adopted to delineate the local buffer zone, \n\ndifferences in regional settings and water quality parameters. Ou et al. (2016) also linked these \n\ndifferences to the sampling strategy and data resolution. The higher or lower resolution of the \n\nland-use data may miss some crucial landscape features of the land-use composition and \n\nconfiguration. In our study, we considered seasonal variation, and we used high-resolution \n\nspatial data, which can differ from studies that only considered rainy season or used low-\n\nresolution data. Other differential in our work is that the agricultural land was comprised by \n\nsmall farms, with isolated houses, without sewage collection, which was strongly connected to \n\nwater quality degradation. \n\nNevertheless, our findings highlight the forest cover as a key landscape feature to \n\nprevent deterioration of water quality. Additionally, we found that grassland (pasture with few \n\ncattle or abandoned pasture) does not lead to water degradation as agriculture and urbanization, \n\nand it could be a good opportunity for forest restoration plans. This information can help \n\nmanagers to establish best alternatives for the water quality improvement in the headwater \n\nstreams. We showed that the environmental planning must consider the whole watershed to \n\ndesign public policies aiming at the water resources conservation, not only the riparian zone, \n\nalthough the riparian forest restoration can be prioritized as a short-term action aiming at the \n\nwater quality improvement (Vettorazzi and Valente, 2016). \n\nAccording to Rodrigues et al. (2011), better agricultural and cattle production practices \n\ncan provide new areas for restoration actions in rural watersheds. Low-order streams, often \n\nlocated on steeper slopes, are more sensitive to nonpoint source pollutants loading than flat \n\nareas in the watershed (Yang et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2016). Then, the environmental planning \n\nof these areas is crucial to ensure water with high quality downstream. \n\n \n\n\n\n54 \n\n3.5. Conclusion \n\nWe conclude, based in our results, that forest cover is the most important LULC type \n\nto maintain the water quality in the low-order streams, and agriculture and urban areas are \n\nresponsible for the water quality degradation. \n\nSewage from residential areas, sediments and nutrients loading from the short-cycle \n\ncrops lead to the nonpoint pollution into the small rivers. Grassland has mixed impact on water \n\nquality, and in general does not lead to water quality degradation, once they represent low-\n\nproductivity or abandoned pasturelands. \n\nBesides the spatial variation, water quality also varies with seasonal changes, \n\nespecially with streamflow and temperature variability. Thus, streamflow and temperature are \n\nalso important predictors to explain some of the water quality parameters variation. \n\nThe water quality parameters have different responses regarding the landscape \n\ncomposition within the watershed and the riparian zone. However, the overall water quality \n\nvariation is better explained by LULC composition at watershed scale than at riparian zone. It \n\nsuggests that the water management and forest restoration planning need to adopt a multi-scale \n\nperspective, but the actions must be directed to the watershed management. Although the \n\nimportance of the riparian zone, our study demonstrates that the watershed management in low-\n\norder streams is extremely necessary for the water quality maintenance aiming at the water \n\nresources conservation downstream. Nevertheless, the riparian restoration can be prioritized as \n\na short-term action aiming at the water quality improvement. \n\n \n\nReferences \n\nAbell R., Allan, J.D., 2002.

RIPARIAN RESTORATION FOR PROTECTING WATER QUALITY \n\nIN TROPICAL AGRICULTURAL WATERSHEDS \n\nAbstract  \n\nLand-use change in riparian zones is one of the most significant threats to water quality in \n\nstream ecosystems. Riparian forests play an important role in protecting water quality, and there is \n\na need to assess the role of riparian restoration in reducing nutrients and sediment loading. This \n\nstudy uses watershed simulation modeling to evaluate impacts of riparian forest restoration on water \n\nquality in agricultural watersheds. Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is used to simulate \n\nstreamflow, suspended sediment and nutrients of the Sarapu\u00ed River basin, southeastern Brazil. We \n\nfound a spatial and temporal variation in water quality impacts resulting fro m variation in land use/ \n\nland cover (LULC) and rainfall patterns. Subbasins with agricultural and residential lands showed a \n\nhigher sediment and nutrients loads than others covered by forest and pasture, and this relation is \n\nstrongest during the rainy season. Riparian restoration reduced suspended sediment (by 9.26%), total \n\nnitrogen (22.6%) and total phosphorus (7.83%). However, forest conservation in the whole \n\nwatershed cannot be substituted by protecting only the riparian zone preservation, as forested \n\nsubbasins showed better water quality than those covered by other LULC types. The results show \n\nthe importance of restoration plans in the riparian zone, providing a scientific understanding of the \n\nrole of riparian forest for the water quality improvement by reducing nutrients and sediments loading \n\ninto the river. \n\nKeywords: 1.

Introduction  \n\nThe riparian zone is the interface between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and can \n\nprovide many ecosystem functions, as well as playing an important role on nutrients and \n\nsediments transfer (Kuglerov\u00e1 et al., 2014; Ou et al., 2016). Although the riparian forest can \n\ncontribute to the water quality protection, it is one of the most degraded ecosystems in the world \n\n(Nilsson and Berggren, 2000; Kuglerova et al., 2014). Replacing riparian forest by other land \n\nuses decreases water quality due to bank erosion, increasing nutrient and sediment loads into \n\nthe river (Ding et al., 2013, Ou et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2016a). Therefore, land use change in \n\nriparian zones is one of the most significant threats to water quality in stream ecosystems, \n\nbringing the importance of understanding the benefits from their restoration (Zhang et al., 2013; \n\nYang et al., 2016b). \n\nRiparian forest cover can play a major role in the biogeochemical cycles in watersheds. \n\nThe vegetation provides protection against erosion, retention of pollutants, excessive nutrients \n\nrunoff and increased water temperature (Sopper, 1975; Sweeney et al., 2004; Lima and Zakia, \n\n2006; Mingoti and Vettorazzi, 2011; Schilling and Jacobson, 2014; Tanaka et al., 2016) and \n\nbenefits both the quality of human life and survival of aquatic species (Saalfeld et al., 2012; \n\n\n\n62 \n\nDing et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2016a; Tanaka et al., 2016). Especially in the currently context \n\nin that agriculture and urban growth have been appointed as the primary cause of water quality \n\ndegradation (Uriarte et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2016). \n\nRiparian buffers have been pointed as effective in reducing nutrients and sediment \n\nloading into streams (Uusi-K\u00e4mpp\u00e4 and Jauhiainen 2010; Gonzales-Inca et al., 2015; Monteiro \n\net al. 2016; Ding et al., 2016). Cho et al. (2010) observed that intact riparian forest reduced 20.5 \n\n% of sediment load in a watershed in USA. In this context, the proximity to surface water has \n\nbeen used as a criterion for prioritizing areas for forest restoration in watersheds (Vettorazzi \n\nand Valente, 2016). However, the effectiveness of the riparian buffers depends on the \n\nhydrogeological condition, and it is influenced by numerous factors and varies from local to \n\nregional scales (Wang et al., 2013; Gonzales-Inca et al., 2015). \n\nLand use impacts on water quantity and quality are assessed using hydrological models \n\nin urban and agricultural watersheds (Wangpimool et al., 2013; Pereira et al., 2014; Lin et al., \n\n2015; Wagner et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2016). Lin et al. (2015) assessed the hydrologic and \n\nwater quality impacts of agricultural land changes in North America. Nejadhashemi et al. \n\n(2012) used models to evaluate land use change impacts in agricultural watersheds in Midwest. \n\nStudies have also reported the impacts of riparian land use on water quality worldwide \n\nusing hydrological models. Gitau et al. (2006) used a model in evaluating a combination of best \n\nmanagement practices that include riparian buffers in reducing phosphorus loads. Moriasi et al. \n\n(2011) used a hydrological model to quantify the effect of riparian forest buffer and Bermuda \n\ngrass filter strip on sediment yield in a reservoir in USA. Yang et al. (2016b) examined the \n\nwater quality effects of riparian wetland losses and restoration in Canada.  \n\nHowever, the impacts of riparian restoration in tropical river basins are not well \n\ndocumented. Monterio et al. (2016) observed that riparian restoration to comply with Brazilian \n\nForest Code could reduce sediment load by 29.4% in a catchment in the Brazilian Cerrado. The \n\nAtlantic Forest, in particular, is a biodiversity hotspot (Mittermeier et al., 2011) highly \n\nthreatened since it has been reduced to only 11% of its original cover (Ribeiro et al., 2009). Its \n\nreduction has affected the water quality and, consequently, water supply (Strassburg et al. \n\n2016). \n\nThere is a need to understand the importance of tropical forest cover to water quality \n\nand how the riparian forest restoration can contribute to the water sources conservation. Here, \n\nwe use a watershed hydrological model to simulate the effects of riparian zone restoration on \n\nwater quality in tropical agricultural watersheds. It presents a comparative evaluation of \n\nwatershed-wide and riparian zone forest restoration on water quality for policy considerations. \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\nThis is important in using riparian zone management within the broader context of watershed \n\nsystems. The specific objectives were: (1) to model hydrological processes for streamflow and \n\nwater quality in watershed system; (2) to evaluate the impacts of agricultural and residential \n\nlands on sediment and nutrient loadings; (3) to assess the importance of the tropical forest cover \n\non water quality; and (4) to simulate a riparian zone restoration scenario and its impacts on \n\nagricultural watershed system. \n\n4.2. Material and Methods \n\n4.2.1. Study Area \n\nThe study area is the Sarapu\u00ed River basin (1,550 km2), located in the S\u00e3o Paulo State \n\n(between the coordinates UTM 23S 195,000 m and 265,000 m; 7,360,000 m and 7,420,000 m), \n\nsoutheastern Brazil (Figure 1). \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Land use/land cover of Sarapu\u00ed River basin and the six experimental watersheds, Brazil. \n\n \n\nThe main rivers of the basin flow from east to west. The drainage network is \n\nparticularly dense in the eastern portion of the basin, where the highest elevations can be found. \n\nThe density of the drainage network decreases in the central and west part. Most of the soil \n\ntypes in the Sarapu\u00ed River basin are red or yellow tropical soils, mainly Latosols, and low-\n\nactivity clays predominate. However, other soil types also occur in the basin, as Gleysols and \n\nyoung soils like Regosols and Fluvisols. Gleysols occur more on the central and west portion \n\nof the basin. The region is under the influence of Cwa climate (humid temperate with dry \n\n\n\n64 \n\nwinters). Annual precipitation is between 1355 mm and 1808 mm (CEPAGRI, 2014), and the \n\nrain mostly falls from October through March. Between December and February are the \n\nmaximum precipitations (around 200 mm monthly) (CEPAGRI, 2014). Temperatures range \n\nfrom 5\u00b0C to 32\u00b0C, with an annual average of 20\u00b0C. January and February are the hottest months \n\n(monthly temperature average of 24\u00b0C), and June and July are the coldest months (monthly \n\ntemperature average of 16\u00b0C). \n\nSarapu\u00ed River is a tributary of Tiete River, one of the main rivers in Brazil. Tiete river \n\nshowed the lowest values of the national water quality index in 2014 (SMA, 2014). Sarapu\u00ed \n\nRiver basin is a particular case of an agricultural watershed close to very high-density urban \n\nregions like Sorocaba and Sao Paulo. Sarapu\u00ed River supplies four cities in the S\u00e3o Paulo State, \n\nand its proximity to those regions represent trends for agricultural and urban sprawl due to the \n\ndemands from the big cities. It was originally covered by Atlantic Forest, which has been \n\nreplaced by agriculture, pasture, eucalyptus and residential (urban) areas. Pasture and \n\nagriculture lands represent, together, 53% of the basin. Agriculture is characterized by the \n\nproduction of grains, fruits, and vegetables. Despite the agricultural activities, the basin still \n\npresents 37% of forest cover. \n\nWe selected six 3rd-order streams (numbered S1 to S6) (Figure 1) within the Sarapu\u00ed \n\nRiver basin to be our experimental watersheds and to establish the sampling sites, where we \n\ncollected water samples during 2013 and 2014 for comparing with simulated data. We selected \n\nwatersheds with similar physical characteristics: area, shape, average slope and soil types, but \n\nwith different LULC patterns: three forested watersheds (more than 55% of forest cover) and \n\nthree degraded (less than 35%). S5 has 75% of forest cover followed by sites 1 and 2 (both with \n\n60% of forest cover). S3 presents only 25% of forest cover, 30% of agriculture and the largest \n\nresidential area (12%). S4 has the largest agricultural area (54%) and 35% of forest cover. S6 \n\nis 29% covered by forest, 32% by agriculture and 32% by pasture. \n\n4.2.2. Conceptual Model \n\nThe conceptual framework for the Sarapu\u00ed River Basin Model consists of a system \n\nincluding the watershed hydro-physical characteristics, land use/management and conservation \n\nactions (riparian restoration), with water quality as the effect (Figure 2). We used slope, \n\nhydrology, climate, soil and LULC information to calibrate a hydrological model for the \n\nSarapu\u00ed River basin to assess the water quality characteristics and their relation to LULC \n\npattern. Then, we created a new LULC map simulating a 100% riparian restoration. The new \n\nscenario was used in the model to simulate water quality responses of riparian forest restoration. \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Conceptual model for the Sarapu\u00ed River basin, Brazil. \n\n \n\n4.2.3. SWAT Model Development \n\nModels have long been used in water resources management to guide decision-making \n\nand improve understanding of the watershed system. Hydrological and water quality data can \n\nbe modeled at different spatial and temporal scales. Integration between water quality mon-\n\nitoring and modeling has been suggested to understand surface water quality better and to make \n\nappropriate and effective decisions for nonpoint source pollution control (Davenport et al., \n\n2008). Models calibration enables to simulate alternative scenarios and evaluate the dynamics \n\nof the watershed (Pessoa et al., 1997). \n\nSWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model was used to model streamflow, \n\nsediment yield (total suspended solids) and nutrients load (total nitrogen and total phosphorus). \n\nSWAT is a non-point source pollution model developed by Dr. Jeff Arnold for the USDA \n\nAgricultural Research Service (ARS) (Neitsch et al., 2011). SWAT was developed to predict \n\nthe impact of land management practices on water, sediment and chemical yields in watersheds \n\nwith varying soils, land use and management conditions over long periods of time (Neitsch et \n\nal., 2011). It is a continuous-time, semi-distributed, process-based river basin model (Arnold et \n\nal., 2012). Simulation of the hydrology of a watershed in the model is separated into two major \n\ndivisions: land phase, that controls the amount of water, sediment, nutrient and pesticide \n\nloadings to the main channel; and routing phase, defined as the movement of water and the \n\n\n\n66 \n\nother components through the channel network of the watershed to the outlet (Neitsch et al., \n\n2011). It has been applied to understand the sediment losses and nutrient loadings in the \n\nwatershed around the world (Marshall and Randhir, 2008; Reungsang et al., 2009; Wilson and \n\nWeng, 2011; Poudel et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2015). \n\nThe SWAT model divides a basin into subbasins connected by stream networks. Each \n\nsubbasin is further divided into hydrologic response units (HRUs) that are unique combinations \n\nof different LULC types, soils, and surface slopes. Within each subbasin, the areas with similar \n\nLULC, soil types, and surface slopes are lumped together into a single HRU. The model \n\nrequires several data, which encompasses LULC map, soil map, elevation map, precipitation, \n\ntemperature, humidity, streamflow, and water quality input. Those data are necessary for model \n\ncalibration and validation, the two steps for developing a hydrological model. \n\nIn this study, the Sarapu\u00ed River basin was divided into 178 subbasins, including our \n\nsix experimental watersheds. Each experimental watershed was represented by a subbasin in \n\nthe model. \n\nThe model was set to define multiple HRUs with a 2% threshold level for each \n\nsubbasin \u2013 that is, any LULC or soil type that covered 2% or more of the subbasin was defined \n\nas an HRU. \n\n4.2.3.1. Data \n\nThe inputs for the SWAT model of the Sarapu\u00ed River basin are derived from different \n\nsources, and they were reprojected in UTM SIRGAS 2000. \n\nWe used a 30-m Digital Elevation Map (DEM) from the Environmental Planning \n\nCoordination of the S\u00e3o Paulo State (CPLA, 2013). SWAT model produces a slope map using \n\nthe DEM. For the slope classes, we used the Brazilian classification from Embrapa (1999). We \n\nused the stream network data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE, \n\n2015) (1:50,000 scale). The LULC map was extracted from our own thematic map (1:50,000 \n\nscale) obtained by on-screen digitizing of a Landsat TM-5 scene from 2010 (Figure 1). We used \n\nour own map of soil types, produced by sensor data and soil samples collected in 2014. The soil \n\ntypes found in the Sarapu\u00ed River basin are Gleysol, Yellow Latosol, Red-yellow Latosol, \n\nRegosol, Fluvisol, and Cambisol. The soil properties like number of layers, depth of the lower \n\nboundary of each surface layer, bulk density, available water capacity, saturated hydraulic \n\nconductivity and percentage of soil particles were collected from the Agronomic Institute of \n\nCampinas (IAC) (Oliveira, 1999) and specialized literature (Juhasz et al., 2006; IBGE, 2007; \n\nGomes and Pereira, 2009). The hydrological classification followed Sartori et al. (2005) for \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\nBrazilian soils. We use an equation proposed by Baumer (1990) for albedo, and for soil \n\nerodibility factor (USLE \u2013 K) an equation proposed by Williams (1995). \n\nDaily weather information was collected from four official stations, provided by the \n\nNational Meteorological Institute (INMET): S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 Mirante do Santana, S\u00e3o Miguel \n\nArcanjo, Sorocaba, and Iguape. We used the following weather information: solar radiation \n\n(MJ/m2/day), wind speed, maximum and minimum air temperature (\u00b0C) and relative humidity. \n\nThe other parameters are derived from those data, using the equations presented on SWAT 2012 \n\nmanual (Winchell et al., 2013). \n\nPrecipitation data for the 1955-2014 period was obtained from five gauge stations from \n\nthe National Water Agency (ANA, 2015): S\u00e3o Miguel Arcanjo, Tatu\u00ed \u2013 Sarapu\u00ed, Piedade, \n\nSorocaba and S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 Mirante do Santana. Streamflow, suspended solids and nutrients data \n\nwere collected from ANA at two gauge stations: Sarapu\u00ed River and Pirapora River (Figure 1), \n\nand from our own data of the experimental watersheds. Daily loads of suspended solids and \n\nnutrients were estimated using the product of the daily streamflow volume and the \n\ninstantaneous water quality measurements. \n\n4.2.3.2. Model Calibration and validation and sensitivity analysis \n\nThe calibration and sensitivity analysis were performed by optimization methods using \n\nthe Sequential Uncertainty Fitting algorithm (SUFI-2) (Abbaspour, 2011) in the SWAT-CUP \n\nsoftware (Abbaspour, 2015). We calibrated the model starting with streamflow, followed by \n\nsediment and then nutrients as suggested for calibration procedure (Abbaspour, 2011). The \n\nstreamflow calibration is a first step necessary to obtain the water quality parameters. \n\nStreamflow was calibrated and validated against daily, monthly and yearly \n\nstreamflow, for a period of 33 years (1980-2012), with three years as a warm up period. The \n\nstreamflow data from the Sarapu\u00ed River gauge were used for observed values for calibration. \n\nStreamflow data from the Pirapora river gauge were used for validation. Sediment and nutrients \n\nwere calibrated for the period of seven years (2004-2010) for the Sarapu\u00ed River basin and \n\nvalidated using the six experimental watershed data. \n\nWe parameterized the model following suggestions in SWAT manual (Winchell et al., \n\n2013) for three levels: basin, subbasin and HRU levels. We also used parameters identified in \n\nthe literature that has the potential to influence on streamflow, sediment yield and nutrients \n\nloading (Arnold et al., 2012; Andrade et al., 2013; Kushwaha and Jain, 2013; Abbaspour et al., \n\n2015; Fukunaga et al., 2015). \n\n\n\n68 \n\nNumerical and graphical performance criteria were used to evaluate model \n\nperformance during calibration and validation. The numerical performance criteria include \n\ncoefficient of determination (R2) (Coffey et al., 2004), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NS) (Nash \n\nand Sutcliffe, 1970) and percent bias (PBIAS) (Gupta et al., 1999), as shown in Equations 1 to \n\n3: \n\n?2 =\n[? (??,? ? ????)(??,? ? ???? ?? )]\n\n2\n\n? (??,? ? ????)\n2 ? (??,? ? ????)\n\n2\n??\n\n \n\nwhere Q is a variable (e.g., discharge), and m and s stand for measured and simulated, \n\ni is the ith measured or simulated data. \n\n?? = 1 ?\n? (?? ? ??)\n\n2\n? ?\n\n? (??,? ? ????)\n2\n\n?\n\n \n\nwhere Q is a variable (e.g., discharge), and m and s stand for measured and simulated, \n\nrespectively, and the bar stands for average. \n\n????? = 100\u00d7\n? (?? ? ??)?\n?\n?=1\n\n? ??,?\n?\n?=1\n\n \n\nwhere Q is a variable (e.g., discharge), and m and s stand for measured and simulated, \n\nrespectively. Percent bias measures the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or \n\nsmaller than the observations. The optimum value is zero, where low magnitude values indicate \n\ngood simulations. Positive values indicate model underestimation and negative values indicate \n\nmodel overestimation (Gupta et al., 1999). \n\nWe conducted sensitivity analysis to check which input or calibration parameters have \n\nthe strongest influence on the model results. A t?test was used to identify the relative \n\nsignificance of each parameter. The sensitivities are estimates of the average changes in the \n\nobjective function resulting from changes in each parameter, while all other parameters are \n\nchanging. This gives relative sensitivities based on linear approximations and, hence, only \n\nprovides partial information about the sensitivity of the objective function to model parameters. \n\nIn this analysis, the larger, in absolute value, the value of t?stat, and the smaller the p?value, the \n\nmore sensitive is the parameter (Abbaspour, 2011). \n\n \n\n4.2.4. Land-use/land-cover patterns and water quality \n\nAfter calibrated, the model was applied to evaluate the impact of LULC patterns \n\n(agriculture, residential areas, and forest) on water quality for the Sarapu\u00ed River basin in a \n\ncurrent scenario. We compared subbasins with different LULC types and their water quality \n\n(1) \n\n(2) \n\n(3) \n\n\n\n69 \n\n \n\nresponses. Forested subbasins were compared to agricultural ones regarding sediment and \n\nnutrients loading. \n\nThe spatial distribution of annual (30-year average) values for water quality attributes \n\nwas mapped for each subbasin. The values of each water quality parameter were reclassified \n\nby natural breaks (Jenks) method into three categories to represent low, medium and high levels. \n\n4.2.5. Riparian forest restoration impacts on water quality \n\nWe simulated the riparian forest restoration impacts on the water quality for the \n\nSarapu\u00ed River basin. We considered Riparian Zone the Permanent Preservation Area (PPA), \n\naccording to the Brazilian forest code (law 12651 of 2012). The law sets a buffer of 30m from \n\nthe river banks and 50m around the springs. FAO recommendation for water quality protection \n\nis also 30m, as well as proposed by Welsch (1991). We created a riparian-scenario besides the \n\ncurrent scenario to simulate the PPA restoration, adding forest cover in all the PPA buffer in \n\nthe current LULC map. The PPA buffer was created from the stream network using ArcGIS \n\n(ESRI). The new LULC map was added to the calibrated model to run the riparian-scenario \n\nresults. \n\nWe simulated the impact of the riparian forest restoration on total suspended solids \n\n(TSS), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). Annual and average loads during 1983-\n\n2014 were calculated under the current and riparian scenarios. \n\n4.3. Results and Discussion \n\n4.3.1.

It was calibrated daily, monthly and yearly, and the comparisons for the observed and the \n\nsimulated streamflow are shown in Figure 3. The model performance statistics were better for \n\nmonthly calibration (Table 2), as reported by Lin et al. (2015) in the USA and Schmalz et al. \n\n(2015) in China. \n\nThe streamflow showed an R2 greater than 0.6 for calibration and validation process \n\n(Table 2), with a value of 0.85 and 0.79 for monthly calibration and validation, respectively. \n\nSchmalz et al. (2015) obtained close values of R2 for calibration (0.88) and validation (0.85).  \n\nWe obtained an acceptable value of NS (>0.36) considering daily (0.65) and yearly \n\n(0.71) calibration and a value equal to 0.81 for monthly calibration, which is seen as good \n\naccording to the classification proposed by Liew et al. (2007). Lin et al. (2015) obtained close \n\nvalues of NS for monthly calibration (between 0.75 and 0.82). At validation process, the NS \n\nkept an acceptable value, with an NS equal to 0.58 for monthly streamflow average. Pereira et \n\nal. (2014), also studying a river basin in Southern Brazil, found an NS value of 0.65 and 0.70 \n\nfor calibration and validation period, respectively. Glavan et al. (2011) also found better results \n\nfor the calibration (0.62) than for validation (0.47). \n\nPBIAS presented a good value for calibration (<15%) and satisfactory for validation \n\n(<25%). Similar results were found by Fukunaga et al. (2015) modeling streamflow in a \n\nwatershed in the Esp\u00edrito Santo State, Brazil, who obtained better results for calibration (NS = \n\n0.75, PBIAS = 11%) than for validation (NS = 0.67, PBIAS = 22%).  \n\nAccording to Liew et al. (2007), when NS is lower than 0.36 and PBIAS is higher than \n\n25%, the model is considered unsatisfactory. Thus, our model was considered able to predict \n\nstreamflow of the Sarapu\u00ed River Watershed. \n\n \n\nTable 2.

Comparisons of the observed and simulated streamflow for the Sarapu\u00ed River Basin Model, Brazil: A) \n\nDaily, B) Monthly, and C) Yearly. \n\nThe comparison between observed and simulated sediment and nutrients is presented \n\nin Figure 4. Sediment and nutrients calibration showed acceptable value for NS and PBIAS. We \n\nobtained an R2 of 0.68, 0.54 and 0.62 for TSS, TN, and TP, respectively. Considering NS \n\ncoefficient, TSS showed a value of 0.65 while TN and TP showed values of 0.47 and 0.46. For \n\nPBIAS, we obtained values of 6.85, 0.18 and 24.45 for TSS, TN, and TP, respectively. Yang et \n\nal. (2016a) in China, obtained NS values > 0.55 and R2 > 0.7 for TN and TP calibration. In \n\nanother way, Ferrant et al. (2011) found that SWAT model performed poorly in simulating \n\nnitrogen loads, with an NS coefficient of 0.15. \n\n\n\n73 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4. Observed and simulated total suspended solids (sediment yeld) (A), total nitrogen (TN) (B) and total \n\nphosphorus (TP) (C) for the Sarapu\u00ed River Basin Model, Brazil. \n\n \n\nIn our study, the values for sediment and nutrients calibration were lower than those \n\nfor streamflow, which is expected according to Abbaspour et al. (2015), but it is important to \n\nconsider that the lack of data, especially in Brazil, can contribute with the difficult to calibrate \n\nwater quality parameters (Bressiani et al., 2015). Another point to be considered is the fact that \n\nthe model did not consider the contributions of point source pollution, that exist in the Sarapu\u00ed \n\nriver basin. Abbaspour et al. (2015) pointed that the model uncertainties can be related to \n\nprocesses occurring in the watershed, but not include in the program or processes that are \n\n\n\n74 \n\nincluded in the program, but their occurrences in the watershed are unknown to the modeler or \n\nunaccountable because of data limitation. \n\n4.3.2. Land-use/land-cover patterns and water quality \n\nThe results showed that the highest levels of sediment and nutrients occur in the upper \n\nhalf of the Sarapu\u00ed River basin (Figure 5), the region that presents the steepest slopes and many \n\nof the agricultural lands (Figure 1). Despite being at hillslope, some of the subbasins in the \n\nUpper Sarapu\u00ed basin showed low values of sediment and nutrients. Those subbasins presented \n\na high percentage of forest cover. It is the case of sites 1, 2 and 5. S5 showed the lowest value \n\nfor sediment and nutrients (in the samples collected in 2013 and 2014), and the sites 3 and 4 \n\npresented the highest value between the six experimental watersheds. The simulated data \n\nshowed the same pattern, with sites 3 and 4 presenting the highest level of sediments and \n\nnutrients. \n\nSubbasins covered by agriculture and residential areas in this study showed higher \n\nlevels of sediment and nutrients than subbasins covered by forest and pasture (Figure 5). \n\nForested subbasins showed the best values for water quality parameters. Studies show that \n\nurban and agricultural lands lead to a decreased in water quality (Ometo et al., 2000; Gergel et \n\nal., 2002; Uriarte et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2012; Erol and Randhir, 2013; Huang et al., 2016). \n\nLin et al. (2015) used a SWAT Model to access the impact of bioenergy policies on the water-\n\nquality in the USA. The results showed that an increase of planting areas for corn and soybean \n\nover forest and pasture losses increases sediment and nutrient loading.  \n\nIn our study, watersheds covered by forest followed by those covered by pasture \n\nshowed better water quality than the watersheds with agriculture and residential areas. In the \n\nsame way, Wang et al. (2013) found that forest and farmland cover types play a significant role \n\nin determining the surface water quality. \n\n \n\n\n\n75 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5. Spatial distribution of water quality attributes for the Sarapu\u00ed River basin, Brazil. \n\n \n\nBesides the spatial variation, we also observed a temporal variation of water quality. \n\nRainy season showed higher nutrients and sediments levels than the dry season for the Sarapu\u00ed \n\nRiver basin. The same pattern was observed by other studies (Uriarte et al., 2011; Gonzales-\n\nInca et al., 2015; Ou et al., 2016). Surface runoff wash away the pollutants and soil into the \n\n\n\n76 \n\nriver during the rainy season, carrying out sediments and nutrients (Hasan et al., 2015). \n\nGonzales-Inca et al. (2015) pointed out that the relationship between agricultural use and \n\nnutrient losses is strongest during high flow periods. Our model showed the highest sediment \n\nand nutrients loading between October and March (Figure 4), the rainy season in the region. \n\nThe agricultural areas in the watersheds worked as sources of sediment and nutrients in the \n\nrainy season. \n\nWe observe the relationship between streamflow, sediment, and nutrients especially \n\nwhen we analyze the phosphorus dynamics. A significant relationship was found between TP \n\nand TSS following the variation on streamflow. This relationship demonstrates a high \n\nexplanatory power (92%). Randhir and Tswetkova (2009) also observed a similar relationship, \n\nwith an explanatory power of 83%. Our results from experimental conditions at the six \n\nexperimental watersheds showed a similar relationship, with an explanatory power of 57% for \n\na data collection of one year. Urban and agricultural development frequently increase nitrogen \n\nconcentrations in streamflow and result in the greatest problems of phosphorus loading to water \n\nbodies. Those nutrients are transported by sediment, especially in rainfall events. Transported \n\nsediment from watersheds composed of different land uses can carry high levels of nutrients. \n\nSediment transport of phosphorus can reduce the chemical quality of surface water and result \n\nin substantial changes in aquatic ecosystems (Brooks et al., 2003). Sediment loading represents \n\nthe major problem for water quality in other tropical rivers (Hasan et al., 2015). \n\n4.3.3. Riparian forest restoration impacts on water quality \n\nForest cover in the Sarapu\u00ed River basin has increased by 14% after riparian forest \n\nrestoration (Table 3). Pasture and agriculture have decreased by 8% and 10%, respectively. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n77 \n\n \nTable 3. Land-use/land-cover (LULC) changes after the riparian restoration simulation in the Sarapu\u00ed River basin, \n\nBrazil. \n\nLULC classes \n% current \n\nscenario \n\n% riparian \n\nscenario \n\n% of variation \n\nforest 37.06 42.33 14.22 \n\npasture 28.41 26.08 -8.20 \n\nagriculture 24.42 21.97 -10.03 \n\neucalyptus 5.89 5.73 -2.72 \n\nresidential area 3.52 3.23 -8.24 \n\nindustrial area 0.37 0.33 -10.81 \n\nwater 0.33 0.33 0 \n\n \n\nFigure 6 shows the annual and average loads under the current and riparian scenarios. \n\nThe general trend is that the sediment and nutrients loads were greater under the riparian \n\nscenario than in the current scenario. TSS average reduced by 9.26%, TN by 22.6% and TP by \n\n7.89%. Studies show that riparian forest helps to reduce nitrogen, nitrate, phosphorus, pesticide \n\nand sediment (Krutz et al., 2005; Oliveira et al., 2010; Batson et al., 2012; Saalfeld et al., 2012; \n\nRandhir e Ekness, 2013; Ding et al., 2013, Ou et al., 2016). Simulating the wetland restoration \n\nat the riparian zone, Yang et al. (2016b) found a decrease of 35% of sediment, 28% of TN and \n\n37% of TP. Monteiro et al. (2016) found a sediment reduction of 29.4% by simulating the \n\nriparian restoration according to the Brazilian law in a catchment in the Cerrado. \n\nThese results show that the riparian restoration could be an efficient alternative to \n\nimprove water quality against water treatment processes and wastewater treatment projects. The \n\ncosts associated with water and wastewater projects are enormous and in many cases, they are \n\nnot considered to be implemented in rural areas in Brazil. According to Honey-Ros\u00e9s et al. \n\n(2013), the riparian forest restoration could generate economic savings for water treatment \n\nmanagers in the range of \u20ac57,000-\u20ac156,000 per year in a river in Spain.  \n\n \n\n\n\n78 \n\n \n\nFigure 6. Annual and annual average loads of (A) total suspended solids (sediment yield), (B) total nitrogen (TN) \n\nand (C) total phosphorus (TP) under two different scenarios in the Sarapu\u00ed River basin, Brazil. \n\n \n\nAccording to Hanser et al. (2010), riparian zones play an important role in mediating \n\nthe bi-directional flow of matter and energy between the water body and the surrounding land. \n\nForest cover at the riparian corridor can influence stream nutrient concentrations, physical \n\ncharacteristics and energy balance (Tanaka et al., 2016). Ou et al. (2016) found that the first \n\n100 m of the riparian zone has the largest effect on river water quality. FAO recommendation \n\nfor water quality protection is 30 m, as well as proposed by Welsch (1991) and used in our \n\nstudy. In Victoria, Australia, the minimum width recommendations for riparian zones were \n\nestablished for different levels of land use intensities (Hanser et al., 2010). For low intensity, \n\nthe recommendation to improve water quality is 30m and for high-intensity land use, the \n\nrecommendation is 60m.  \n\nThis is an interesting discussion because the role of the Riparian Zone can be different \n\nfor different land use intensities. In our study, we followed the Brazilian Forest Code that \n\nestablishes a 30m riparian zone protection that does not consider the landscape around. \n\nAccording to Monteiro et al. (2016), the reduction of the 30-m buffer to 5-m riparian corridor \n\n\n\n79 \n\n \n\nonly, as currently discussed in the S\u00e3o Paulo State, reduces the potential of the riparian zone in \n\nreducing sediment into the river. \n\nIt is recognized that there will always be competing social and economic issues that \n\nwill ultimately influence decisions about riparian zone (Hanser et al., 2010). However, the \n\nscientific understanding of riparian zone as it relates to ecological function is important to guide \n\nthe decision making. In this way, our results provide a scientific understanding of the role of \n\nriparian forest for the water quality improvement by reducing nutrients and sediments loading \n\ninto the river. Future restoration plans must incorporate riparian zone as priorities areas in order \n\nto mitigate water quality problems, once our results showed that the riparian forest restoration \n\ncan reduce sediment and nutrients loads into the river by 8 to 23%, respectively. \n\nEspecially in tropical regions, the natural regeneration can improve the provision of \n\necosystem services including water purification (Stranssburg et al., 2016; Chazdon and Uriarte, \n\n2016). Considering that many degraded areas in the tropics are composed by low-productivity \n\nor abandoned pasturelands, those areas are a great opportunity for forest restoration in the \n\ntropical agricultural landscapes (Latawiec et al., 2015). According to Strassburg et al. (2016) \n\nthe natural regeneration of abandoned pasturelands would reduce the costs of purifying the \n\nwater. In the Sarapu\u00ed River watershed, pasture is the second predominant land use, representing \n\n28.4% of the watershed. Better cattle ranching techniques could create new areas for forest \n\nrestoration in this area. \n\nIn this way, riparian restoration can be a good alternative to improve water quality in \n\ntropical watersheds where land use is predominantly for agricultural activities, but it cannot \n\nreplace forest conservation plans for the entire watershed, once forested watersheds showed \n\nbetter water quality than those covered by other LULC types in this study. Our results further \n\ndemonstrate the importance of stopping forest degradation and the establishment of forest \n\nrestoration plans by prioritization of riparian restoration to improve water quality. It is important \n\nto consider sustainable agricultural practices combined with forest conservation plans to \n\nprovide current and future water supply. \n\n \n\n4.4. Conclusions \n\nWe propose a modeling approach to evaluate the impacts of riparian forest restoration \n\non water quality in agricultural watersheds in Brazil using a watershed simulation model \n\n(SWAT). \n\n\n\n80 \n\nThe Sarapu\u00ed River Basin Model is satisfactory to simulate streamflow and water \n\nquality parameters. Water quality has a spatial and temporal variation correlated to LULC \n\npatterns and precipitation events. There is a high correlation between sediment and phosphorus \n\nloading following streamflow variation. Sediment and nutrients increase in high streamflow \n\nperiods. Forested subbasins show better water quality than subbasins covered by anthropogenic \n\nuses. Subbasins covered by agricultural and residential lands have a high contribution to \n\nsediment and nutrients loading into the river and this relation is strongest in the rainy season. \n\nThe riparian restoration, with the increase of forest cover and a decrease of agriculture and \n\npasture, contributes to the decrease of sediment, nitrogen and phosphorus loading. \n\nFuture conservation plans in agricultural watersheds can use our results to locate areas \n\nfor restoration in order to improve water quality. Riparian restoration can be a good alternative \n\nto improve water quality in watersheds where land use is predominantly related to agricultural \n\nactivities, but a forest conservation plan for the entire watershed cannot be discarded. The \n\nmanagement practices must have a watershed perspective not only a local focus on properties \n\nor towns. Future management plans and environment policies should consider the landscape \n\nplanning at the whole watershed, indicating the riparian restoration as the first step to water \n\nquality improvement, especially in regions where available areas for forest restoration are \n\nscarce. \n\nThe model provides satisfactory results for water parameters simulation and enables \n\nto create future scenarios, but the lack of available data can be a challenge to apply it in some \n\nregions. Future studies about land-use change and the impacts on water quality must be \n\nconducted in tropical regions where agricultural activities are in expansion. The contribuition \n\nof the point source pollution must be considered in future studies about watershed management. \n\nRiparian zone shows a high importance for water quality, and different vegetation types, the \n\ndegree of forest conservation and buffer width can be tested for riparian restoration in future \n\nresearches. \n\n \n\nReferences  \n\nAbbaspour, K, 2011.

FINAL CONSIDERATIONS \n\nThroughout the chapters, this study has showed the importance of forest cover \n\nmaintenance to the water conservation, in tropical agricultural watersheds, once it provides \n\nsediment, nutrients and other pollutants retention to the water bodies, whereas agricultural and \n\nurban lands are the major land uses responsible for water quality degradation. \n\n The soil constantly exposed, present in short cycle crops, as in our study area, \n\nare heavily subject to erosion, increasing runoff in storm episodes, especially in the rainy season \n\nin tropical areas. The sediment from these areas carries nutrients and other pollutants into the \n\nriver, mainly total phosphorus (TP), which is easily adsorbed by the soil particles. Thus, the \n\nland-use impacts on water quality are controlled by the hydrologic conditions and, in this study, \n\nthe watersheds that presented the greatest agricultural area showed the highest pollutant \n\nconcentrations and the greatest temporal variation because of this process. On the other hand, \n\neven with agricultural areas, watersheds with high percentage of forest cover present better \n\nwater quality than watersheds mostly covered by other land uses, which demonstrates that forest \n\ncover contributes to minimizing the negative impacts from the agricultural activities. \n\nThe urban areas, represented in this study by small residential areas scattered within \n\nthe agricultural lands or by small neighborhoods of the town, which do not have sewage \n\ncollection, have a strong influence on the river water quality despite their low percentage in the \n\nlandscape, regarding the production of organic matter (organic suspended solids \u2013 OSS), \n\nnutrients (TP and TN), and fecal coliforms (FC) and decreasing dissolved oxygen (DO) \n\nconcentrations. Besides, the isolated houses present in the agricultural areas also seem to lea d \n\nwater quality degradation, especially in the FC production. \n\nIn contrast to agriculture and urban areas, in our study area, where the livestock \n\nactivities are not intensive, pasture (or abandoned pasture) does not generate water quality \n\ndegradation, in general, showing that the grassland cover contributes to minimizing runoff and, \n\nconsequently, the pollutants loading into the river. However, forested areas have a higher \n\npotential of pollutant retention. \n\nThe water quality parameters have different responses regarding the landscape \n\ncomposition within the watershed and the riparian zone, which requires a multi-scale \n\nperspective of the decision-makers regarding the water resources management. Nonetheless, \n\nthe land-use and land-cover pattern within the watershed exerts greater influence on water \n\nquality than considering only the riparian zone, which emphasizes the importance of the \n\n\n\n92 \n\nwatershed management in an effort to order the land use and occupation guaranteeing the \n\necosystem services provision in keeping water clean. \n\nNevertheless, the riparian restoration can reduce by up 23% the sediment and nutrients \n\nloading into the river, which shows off the advantage in keeping the forest cover along the \n\nbuffer zone surrounding the rivers. Therefore, the riparian restoration can be prioritized as a \n\nshort-term action aiming at the water quality improvement, especially in watersheds mostly \n\ncovered by agriculture and in regions where available areas for forest restoration are scarce. \n\nHowever, to ensure water with good quality downstream, proper management need to be \n\nimplemented on the low-order streams. \n\nForest restoration and conservation plans, better soil management practices from \n\nagricultural activities and sewage collection need to be adopted for the entire watershed aiming \n\nat the water quality improvement. In this regard, this study can contribute to planning future \n\nactions and policies design of forest and water resources management and conservation. It can \n\nalso contribute to future studies on water management strategies and negative impacts of \n\ndeforestation and forest degradation.   \n\nThe crescent demand for drinking water requires strategies of long-term water quality \n\nmaintenance, which involves a holistic view of the ecosystem, and the understanding of the \n\nprocesses in the watershed that are a mix of natural and anthropic factors. The balance between \n\nenvironmental conservation and economic expansion is needed to the sustainability of human \n\nactivities and the other species survival that inhabit the same planet. To achieve this goal, \n\nscience and policy need to walk side by side, and researches like the present study are important \n\nto bring science closer to critical environmental, social and economic issues that we are \n\ncurrently facing."}]}}}
