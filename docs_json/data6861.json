The isolation of these microorganisms was carried out beforehand, assuming that they would be better adapted to petroleum hydrocarbons, as the landfarming consisted of an area impacted by the deposit of such compounds. The Bartha and Pramer respirometric test was used to measure the rate of biodegradation of the hydrocarbons by the mixed-culture of microorganisms via the evolution of CO2. The results obtained with respect to the efficiency of biodegradation showed no significant differences (P>0.05), indicating no increase in the biodegradation process using the inoculum. The addition of nutrients (N, P, K) also did not contribute to an increase in biodegradation of the oil residue studied.\nKey words: biodegradation, oil residue, petroleum, inoculum, mixed-culture\nINTRODUCTION\nThe effectiveness of microorganisms as agents in the destruction and recycling of organic matter in the biosphere is widely acknowledged (Regis and Bidoia, 2005). Microorganisms are considered to be efficient biodegraders due to their abundance, the wide variety of species, and their catabolic and anabolic versatility, as well as their ability to adapt to adverse environmental conditions. Through the metabolic activity of these microorganisms, organic pollutants can be transformed into water, CO2 and biomass (Genow et al., 1994).\nThe appropriate disposal of residues generated in different industrial processes has been of great concern because of the speed and intensity of the environmental damage they can provoke. Oil\nresidues, or oil sludge, resulting from industrial processes in oil refineries can pollute the environment, representing a danger to all forms of life when not disposed appropriately. Strategies for controlling environmental contamination by petroleum and its derivatives have been the subject of various studies over the past three decades (Miranda et al., 2007).\nThe biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons by natural populations of microorganisms represents one of the primary mechanisms through which these polluting compounds can be eliminated from the environment (Rosato, 1997). Oil sludge is composed mainly of oil, water, and particulate matter and is extremely difficult to re-use due to its characteristics (Ururahy et al., 1998). One of the alternatives for treating this residue to mitigate\n*Author for correspondence: beraldo_morais@yahoo.com.br\nthe negative environmental impact associated with its disposal is biodegradation using microorganisms.\nThe biodegradation of oil residues requires a complex metabolic pathway which is not always found in a single species of microorganisms but which can be observed in a microbial community. Many studies have been carried out on the biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons using a consortium of microorganisms (Jorgensen et al., 2000; Li et al., 2000; Del' Arco and Fran\u00e7a, 2001; Vasudevan and Rajaram, 2001; Mrayyan and Battikhi, 2005). In a mixed-culture, the metabolic products of one species can be degraded by another present in the culture, and so on successively, leading to complete degradation of the substrate despite the lack of a specific type of microorganism in the community capable of degrading it alone (Kataoka, 2001).\nThe microbial species that degrade hydrocarbons are widely distributed in nature and are not restricted to only a few genera. Some of the various genera of bacteria capable of degrading hydrocarbons\tinclude:\tPseudomonas,\nBrevundimonas, Sphingomonas, Acinetobacter, Rhodococcus, Arthrobacter, Corynebacterium, Bacillus, Ochrobactrum, Stenotrophomonas, Burkholderia,\tXanthomonas,\tand\nHyphomicrobium (Chaineau et al., 1999; Li et al., 2000; Chaerun et al., 2004; Yoshida et al., 2006) and the fungi Aspergillus, Penicillium, Beauveria, Acremonium,\tCladosporium,\tFusarium,\nTrichoderma,\tAmorphoteca,\tNeosartorya,\nPaecilomyces, Talaromyces and Graphium, among others (Chaineau et al., 1999; Chaillan et al., 2004).\nIn addition to using microorganisms with the metabolic systems needed to biodegrade and remove petroleum residues from the environment, the microbial community can also be stimulated by adding nitrogen and phosphorous, preventing the absence of nutrients from becoming a limiting factor in biodegradation. Hydrocarbons are composed mainly of carbon and hydrogen and generally occur in proportions of C:N:P that are not optimal for maximum microbial activity. Studies conducted by Ayotamuno et al. (2006) showed that the use of agricultural fertilizers (NPK) increased the total number of heterotrophic bacteria, accelerating the biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in the soil.\nBiodegradation reached 95% of the hydrocarbons, whereas biodegradation of hydrocarbons in the control soil, which received no nutrients, was apparently unaltered.\nThe complete degradation of a compound to its mineral components, in which the organic carbon of the compound is converted to CO2 by respiration, is called mineralization. When the aerobic conditions are maintained, CO2 evolution can be used as a measure of microbial metabolic activity with reasonable accuracy (Atlas, 1992). Studies involving the measurement of the rate of mineralization can provide important information about the biodegradability of industrial waste compounds, including oil residues.\nVarious methods can be used to measure the rates of carbon dioxide production, such as the respirometric flask. This methodology has been proven effective for establishing the best protocols to follow during the biodegradation of residues as it provides rapid results, making it possible to test various options, such as the addition of nutrients and microorganisms (Balba et al., 1998).\nIn this study, the capacity of a mixed-culture inoculum of microorganisms to increase the biodegradation of oil residues produced in the process of petroleum refinement was tested. Also, the effect of the addition of nutrients, including nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, with respect to an increase in the rate of biodegradation of residue, was studied.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nOil Residue\nThe oil residue studied was collected from the bottom of storage tanks and from discharge treatment units at the Paul\u00ednia Oil Refinery (REPLAN), in the city of Paul\u00ednia, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Characteristics of the oil sludge are presented in Table 1.\nSoil\nThe soil used for the biodegradation assay of the oil residue was collected from a depth of 0 - 50 cm in the \u201cNavarro de Andrade\u201d State Forest, Rio Claro, S\u00e3o Paulo, following Technical Norm L6.245 (Cetesb, 1984). Analysis of its chemical and physical characteristics indicated it had a clay texture (Table 2).\nTable 1 - Oil sludge characteristics.\nPH\tOrganic matter (%)\tTotal P (PPm)\t\tC/N\tDensity (g mL-1)\tHumidity (%) 65 \u00b0C 105 \u00b0C\t\t\tN\tMg\t(%) S\tFe\tAl\n7.2\t63.9\t908\t\t66.9\t1.03\t80.9\t81.3\t\t0.5\t0.1\t0.3\t0.7\t0.7\n\t\tMn\tCu\tZn\t(ppm) Co\tBa\tCd\tCr\tNi\tPb\t\t\t\t\n\t\t138\t27.5\t683\t2.5\t52.1\t0.3\t57.8\t14.1\t13.2\t\t\t\t\nTable 2 - Chemical and physical characteristics of the soil used for the biodegradation assay of the oil residue.\nPH (water)\tOrganic carbon (g kg-1)\tTotal N (%)\tTotal P (mg kg-1)\tCEC (mmol kg-1)\tMicronutrients (mg kg-1) Fe Mn Cu B Zn\tSand\tClay (%)\tSilt\n5.8\t13.0\t0.1\t3.0\t43.4\t4.0 4.5 0.8 0.14 0.2\t41.2\t54.4\t4.4\nPreparation of the Mixed-culture Inoculum\nThe microorganisms used to elaborate the mixed-culture inoculum were isolated from an area impacted by petroleum hydrocarbons, the REPLAN landfarming, and later identified (Kataoka, 2001). The microorganisms consisted of seven strains of fungi\t(Trichoderma\npseudokoningii, Eurotium amstelodami, Aspergillus flavus, Pseudallescheria boydii, Aspergillus versicollor, Aspergillus terreus and Cylindrocarpon didymum) and four strains of bacteria\t(Ochrobactrum\tanthropi,\nStenotrophomonas maltophilia, Bacillus cereus, plus one strain unidentified by traditional taxonomic standards).\nThe bacterial strains were grown on Plate Count Agar (PCA) culture medium (5.0 g of tryptone; 2.5 g of yeast extract; 5.0 g of glucose; 15.0 g of agar and 1000 mL of distilled water) at 36 \u00b0C for three days. Aqueous suspensions were then made of each culture, standardizing them to the number 8 tube on the MacFarland scale. The tube 8 represented the turbidity of bacteria at a concentration of 2.4 x 109 mL-1 (Bier, 1994). The fungi strains were inoculated on malt extract culture medium (20.0 g of malt extract; 1.0 g of peptone; 20.0 g of glucose; 20.0 g of agar and 1000 mL of distilled water) at 30 \u00b0C for seven days. Suspensions were then made and standardized by counting spores in a Neubauer chamber containing 107 spores mL-1. For the biodegradation assays of the oily residue, the bacterial strains were added in a proportion of approximately 9.6 x 107 cells g-1 of dry soil while the fungi spores were added in a proportion of 4 x 105 spores g-1 of dry soil.\nBiodegradation Assay of the Oil Residue\nThe biodegradation assay of the oil residue was carried out according to Technical Norm L6.350 (Cetesb, 1990). The Bartha and Pramer respirometer is composed of a closed system containing two connected chambers where the biodegradation process and removal of CO2 take place (Fig. 1). To carry out the biodegradation assays of the oil residue, the field capacity of the soil collected was determined according to the recommendations in Norm L6.350 (Cetesb, 1990). The soil was mixed with the oil residue in a proportion of 5% (w w-1), after correcting the moisture level to 70% of the field capacity. Following the homogenization of the mixture, 50 g were added to each respirometer.\nFour treatments were carried out in triplicate: 1) control containing only 50 g of soil; 2) 50 g of soil/oil residue mixture, also considered as control; 3) 50 g of soil/oil residue mixture plus mixed-culture inoculum; and 4) 50 g of soil/oil residue mixture plus mixed-culture inoculum and a quantity of fertilizer commonly used for plants (to achieve a C:N ratio of 30:1). The respirometers were incubated at 28 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C for 133 days.\nThe CO2 produced was trapped in a 10.0 mL solution of KOH (0.2 N), located in the side-arm of the respirometer. This solution was periodically substituted for another containing no CO2 to avoid saturation with the gas. Quantification of the CO2 was done through titration of KOH removed from the respirometer, after the addition of 1 mL of barium chloride solution (1.0 N) used to precipitate the carbonate ions and two drops of phenolphthalein, with a standard solution of HCl (0.1 N).\nFigure 1 - Model of the system used for the Respirometer.

According to the Norm L6.350 (Cetesb, 1990), 50% of the biodegraded carbon is converted to CO2 and the other 50% is added to the soil as humus and biomass, and the total biodegraded carbon may be calculated using equation I.\nTotal biodegraded carbon = 2 x CO2 produced (I)\nThus, the biodegradation efficiency (BE %) may be calculated by equation II.\nBE (%) = Total biodegraded carbon x 100\nInitial soil organic carbon content\n(II)\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nEvolution of CO2 Production\nFig. 2 presents the results of the evolution of CO2 production during 133 days of biodegradation of the oil residue in the different types of treatments used. The values with respect to CO2 produced in\nthe control treatment containing soil/residue mixture were greater than the treatment containing soil only, also considered to be a control. These results indicated that microorganisms present in the soil could increase the rate of biodegradation of the oil residue or it might activate the microbial metabolism of the soil used in this study.\nThe results showed that, in the treatment containing soil/oil residue mixture inoculated with mixed-culture and fertilizer, the greatest CO2 production occurred in the first 14 days of incubation. The addition of fertilizer together with the inoculum probably favored greater microbial activity under the conditions present in the respirometer in the first days of the assays. Nevertheless, after two weeks, CO2 emission in this system was not greater in relation to the other treatments, which indicated rapid consumption of nutrients and a consequent decrease in microbial activity. Between day 21 and day 37 of the experiment, the control treatment containing soil/oil residue mixture presented greater CO2 evolution in relation to the other treatments, indicating the potential of the microbial community in the soil and in the residue to biodegrade some compounds present in the latter.\nFigure 2 - Evolution of CO2 produced during biodegradation assay of oil residue during 133 days.\nCO2 Accumulated During the Biodegradation Assay of the Oil Residue\nThe findings regarding the quantity of CO2 accumulated during the biodegradation assay in the different treatments (Fig. 3) showed that the\nuse of the inoculum, and of the inoculum together with fertilizer, resulted in an increase of 1.8% and 5.3%, respectively, in the production of CO2 compared to the mixed soil/oil residue control.\nFigure 3 - Cumulative total amounts of CO2 produced during the biodegradation assay of the oil residue.\nMore than 50% of the total CO2 accumulated in the treatments was produced in the first 45 days, probably due to the more rapid consumption of those compounds that were more easily biodegraded by the microorganisms, e.g. linear and open-chain hydrocarbons. Those recalcitrant compounds that were more resistance to degradation were consumed more slowly later or might not have been consumed. Similar findings were reported by Margesin et al. (2000) in a study of biodegradation of diesel fuel, in which a large part of the CO2 production occurred in the first 15 days, followed by a decrease in its production.\nIn studies conducted with different fractions of hydrocarbons present in oil residues from petroleum refinement, a reduction in saturated and aromatic compounds of 70 and 60%, respectively, was observed. Next, a 30% reduction in resins occurred. The asphaltenes, however, remained constant, without undergoing biodegradation (Capelli et al., 2001). These compounds are long-chained, inhibiting their biodegradation, although the low rate of biodegradation of the pollutant can\nalso be attributed to physical factors such as adsorption of the contaminant to the soil particles, or their strong link to organic substances in the soil. Other authors have reported that some petroleum fractions and their derivatives were rarely biodegraded and that the stabilization of the concentrations of these fractions in the soil, called residual concentration, could occur (Nocentini et al., 2000).\nEfficiency of biodegradation\nBased on the CO2 production, the biodegradation efficiency of oil residue was calculated for each treatment using the initial carbon levels in the soil/oil residue mixture (34 g kg-1) and the quantity of biodegraded carbon (Fig. 4). The biodegradation efficiency calculated using the CO2 data refers to the complete transformation of the hydrocarbons to CO2 (mineralization). If hydrocarbons are partially biodegraded, the quantification of CO2 does not take into account these incomplete processes.\nEfficiency of Biodegradation\n\u25a1 Soil/Oil Residue \u25a1 Inoculum \u25a1 Inoculum plus Fertlizer\nFigure 4 - Efficiency of biodegradation according to initial carbon levels in the soil and quantity of carbon biodegraded.\nThe addition of inoculum, and of inoculum plus fertilizer, increased the efficiency of the oil residue biodegradation by 0.52 and 1.57%, respectively, compared to the efficiency of the soil/oil residue control. The statistical test of variance (F = 0.1074; p = 0.8992), however, showed no significant differences in the values (p>0.05). Thus, the addition of inoculum, and of inoculum\nplus fertilizer, did not effectively contribute to the increase in efficiency of biodegradation.\nDue to the presence of petroleum hydrocarbons in the landfarming area where the microorganisms used in the inoculum were isolated, it was thought that they would be better adapted to these compounds and more effective in degrading them. The inefficiency of the use of the inoculum\nobserved in this study could be related to various environmental factors in the process of biodegradation. In addition, following the isolation of the microorganisms from the landfarming, they were stored and later activated in culture media appropriate for growth, perhaps inducing a loss in their capacity to biodegrade and use the hydrocarbons.\nThe nutritional content of the medium in which biodegradation of dangerous substances is to be undertaken should include a good balance between carbon, phosphorous, and nitrogen for the development of the microorganisms (Atlas, 1995; Gallego et al., 2001; Gogoi et al., 2003). The findings suggested that the addition of fertilizer could accelerate the biodegradation of oil residues from petroleum, although the concentration used does not appear to have been appropriate and could be re-adapted using the same methodology. Techniques involving the measurement of CO2 during the biodegradation of dangerous substances have proven useful for establishing protocols for the treatment of industrial wastes and even in programs to recuperate impacted areas, saving time and financial resources.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this study, the use of mixed-culture inoculum and nutrients did not contribute to an increase in the rate of biodegradation of the residue studied. New studies should be developed, however, to optimize the rate of biodegradation of the same residue studied here. It is suggested that microbial strains isolated from environments impacted by dangerous substances should be stored in laboratory conditions very similar to the environments from which they were isolated. This should be done to maintain their existing characteristics and prevent the loss of metabolic activity related to biodegradation. The use of nutrients in commercial form (NPK) may provide economic advantages during the biodegradation of oil residues, although the ideal concentrations must be established.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis study was financed by the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo (FAPESP).
