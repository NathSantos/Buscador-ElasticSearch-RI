This technique may be also applied to \nintroduce structural and functional changes in biomolecules including cellulose. \nRecent studies have demonstrated the potential of UHP towards cellulosic \npulps, namely the ability to promote forced fibre hydration thus improving \ncellulose accessibility and fibrils reorganization. The main purpose of this thesis \nwas the evaluation of UHP potential for the modification of recycled fibres \naiming to improve its performance in the production of tissue paper in \ncollaboration with the biggest national producer Renova FPA, S.A.  \nThe present study has identified the structural changes that occurred in \ncellulose of recycled pulp induced by UHP. Thus the crystalline regions \ndemonstrated to some extent the co-crystallization of appropriately oriented \ncrystallites and the recrystallization of paracrystalline regions as demonstrated \nby XRD and 13C NMR. In addition, UHP have induced fibrils disaggregation \nupon forced hydration thus enhancing their accessibility towards water and \nchemical reagents. A substantial reduction of recycled fibres hornification upon \nUHP has been suggested. UHP-processed recycled fibres also demonstrated \nthe increment of strongly bound water content, as revealed by thermal analysis \nand by FTIR of deuterated samples. Changes in physical structure of cellulose \ncaused the enhancement of such properties of recycled pulp as accessibility, \nhydrophilicity, moisture sorption capacity, surface contact angle, capillarity, \namong others.  \nThe effect of beating (B) before (B-HP) or after the UHP (HP-B) or between two \nbeating stages (B1-HP-B2) on the drainability and mechanical properties were \nevaluated. In these studies, basic papermaking properties and, especially, the \ncapillarity (up to 112%) were improved. The most advantageous from the point \nof view of strength properties of tissue paper production was suggested to be \nthe B1-HP-B2 sequence suitable both for recycled fibres and softwood fibres. A \nsynergetic effect of UHP on the beating of recycled cellulosic fibres has been \ndetected allowing up to 50% energy savings in refining. At the same time, the \nUHP effect on the virgin fibres refinability was much more moderated.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe enhanced accessibility of recycled pulp upon UHP was also used to \n\nimprove its ability towards targeted chemicals, enzymes and nano-sized \n\nstructures. These experiments were carried out also with dried virgin fibres \n\nused as the models of recycled pulp. As concerns enzymes, it was suggested \n\nthat enzymatic modification improves significantly the papermaking properties \n\nof recycled pulp. These improvements were related with selective removal of \n\nxylan bound to impurities and to aggregated cellulose fibrils on the fibre surface \n\nthus favouring the ensuing swelling and inter-fibre bonding in paper. UHP pre-\n\ntreatment and posterior enzymatic treatment revealed a synergetic effect on the \n\nmechanical properties of recycled pulp. This fact was assigned to enhanced \n\naccessibility of fibres towards xylanase by forced hydration and favourable \n\nrearrangement of cellulosic fibrils in fibres after UHP pre-treatment. The \n\nincrease of basic strength properties after UHP and promoted by xylanase \n\ntreatment was up to 30%, being the most pronounced for the tensile strength \n\nand the burst resistance.  \n\nThe impregnation of dyes in combination with UHP also has demonstrated an \n\nenhancement in impregnation/fixation of dye molecules. However, a high \n\ndependence was found on the equilibrium between dye, fixative and cellulosic \n\nfibres, depending on the dye used, both with and without UHP. This behaviour \n\nwas assigned to specificity of dyes molecular structure, affinity, substantivity, \n\namong others. \n\nThe impregnation of humectant compounds applying UHP was also evaluated \n\nand the improved hygroscopicity of treated pulp was confirmed. This fact was \n\nevidenced by capillarity, water absorption capacity and moisture sorption tests.  \n\nThe effect of UHP on the impregnation of antimicrobial agent in fibres has been \n\ncarried out using polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB). Being a cationic \n\npolymer, PHMB was readily absorbed in fibres with and without UHP treatment. \n\nHowever, UHP allowed higher PHMB uptake and better retention after leaching \n\nwhen compared to conventional impregnation without UHP. This was attributed \n\nto stronger interactions between cationic PHMB and cellulose due to the \n\ndeeper penetration of the antimicrobial agent under UHP treatment. However, \n\nthe amount of PHMB to impregnate in fibres is limited because of its negative \n\neffect on paper strength properties due to disruptive action of PHMB as \n\ndebonding agent. \n\nLikewise, silica encapsulated PHMB demonstrated fairly high retention upon \n\nUHP and high release during the leaching tests. Being encapsulated, PHMB \n\nwas not directly bound to cellulose (electrostatic interaction) and the final paper \n\nshowed at the same time fairly high PHMB release rates. \n\nThe impregnation with encapsulated perfumes (Dovena New) was also carried \n\nout and revealed higher impregnation of these nano-sized structures upon UHP \n\nthan under conventional conditions. This was reflected by a higher release of \n\nvolatiles from pulp samples impregnated with stuffed nanoparticles under UHP \n\ntreatment when compared to pulps samples with free adsorbed nanoparticles. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nPalavras-chave Alta press\u00e3o, celulose, pasta virgem, pasta reciclada, hornifica\u00e7\u00e3o, hidrata\u00e7\u00e3o, \nimpregna\u00e7\u00e3o, aditivos \n\n \n\nResumo O processamento de alta press\u00e3o hidrost\u00e1tica (UHP) \u00e9 uma tecnologia em \nexpans\u00e3o, bastante utilizada na ind\u00fastria alimentar para a pasteuriza\u00e7\u00e3o de \nalimentos, ao mesmo tempo que preserva as suas propriedades organol\u00e9ticas. \nEsta t\u00e9cnica pode ainda ser aplicada na modifica\u00e7\u00e3o estrutural e funcional de \nbiomol\u00e9culas, tais como a celulose. Em estudos recentes demonstrou-se o \npotencial da UHP para com pastas celul\u00f3sicas, nomeadamente no que diz \nrespeito \u00e0 sua capacidade de promover a hidrata\u00e7\u00e3o for\u00e7ada das fibras e, \nconsequentemente, melhorar a acessibilidade das mesmas e ainda promover \na reorganiza\u00e7\u00e3o das suas fibrilas. Posto isto, o principal objetivo desta \ndisserta\u00e7\u00e3o consistiu na avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do potencial da UHP na modifica\u00e7\u00e3o de \nfibras recicladas e virgens, para alcan\u00e7ar a melhoria da sua performance na \nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o de pap\u00e9is tissue, em colabora\u00e7\u00e3o com uma das maiores empresas \nnacionais do ramo, a Renova FPA, SA. \nNo presente estudo foram identificadas altera\u00e7\u00f5es estruturais na celulose, \ntanto em fibras recicladas como em virgens, produzidas pelo UHP. Neste \nsentido, as regi\u00f5es cristalinas demonstraram, at\u00e9 certa extens\u00e3o, a co-\ncristaliza\u00e7\u00e3o de cristalitos convenientemente orientados e a recristaliza\u00e7\u00e3o de \nregi\u00f5es paracristalinas, tal como evidenciado por XRD e 13C RMN. Para al\u00e9m \ndisso, a UHP induziu ainda a desagrega\u00e7\u00e3o das fibrilas, aquando o fen\u00f3meno \nde hidrata\u00e7\u00e3o for\u00e7ada, originando maior acessibilidade \u00e0 \u00e1gua e a reagentes \nqu\u00edmicos. Sugere-se ainda a ocorr\u00eancia de uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o significativa da \nhornifica\u00e7\u00e3o das fibras. Fibras processadas por UHP tamb\u00e9m demonstraram \num incremento na presen\u00e7a de \u00e1gua fortemente ligada, tal como sugerido por \nan\u00e1lises t\u00e9rmicas e FTIR de amostras deuteradas. As altera\u00e7\u00f5es produzidas \nna celulose originaram uma melhoria nas propriedades das fibras, \nnomeadamente da sua hidrofilicidade, sor\u00e7\u00e3o de vapor de \u00e1gua, \u00e2ngulo de \ncontacto de superf\u00edcie, capilaridade, etc. \n \n  \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nO efeito da refina\u00e7\u00e3o (B) antes (B-HP), ou depois da UHP (HP-B), ou entre \nrefina\u00e7\u00f5es (B1-HP-B2), tamb\u00e9m foi analisado no que diz respeito \u00e0 \ndrenabilidade e propriedades mec\u00e2nicas das fibras. Nestes estudos, as \npropriedades papeleiras e em especial a capilaridade (112%) revelaram \nmelhorias. Com base nos resultados sugere-se que a sequ\u00eancia B1-HP-B2 \nseria a mais vantajosa para fibras recicladas e fibras virgens longas. Para al\u00e9m \ndisso, o efeito sinerg\u00e9tico da UHP com a refina\u00e7\u00e3o sugere ainda a \npossibilidade de uma poupan\u00e7a de 50% de energia na refina\u00e7\u00e3o. \nAs melhorias induzidas pela UHP na acessibilidade de fibras celul\u00f3sicas foram \ntamb\u00e9m utilizadas para otimizar a impregna\u00e7\u00e3o de qu\u00edmicos, enzimas e \nnanoestruturas. No que diz respeito \u00e0s enzimas, verificou-se que a \nmodifica\u00e7\u00e3o enzim\u00e1tica de fibras celul\u00f3sicas promoveu melhorias significativas \nnas propriedades papeleiras destas, em especial das fibras recicladas. Estes \nresultados foram relacionados com a remo\u00e7\u00e3o seletiva de xilana ligada a \nimpurezas e a fibrilas na superf\u00edcie das fibras, que consequentemente \nfavoreceu o intumescimento e a liga\u00e7\u00e3o entre fibras.  \nA utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de um pr\u00e9-tratamento de UHP e um posterior tratamento \nenzim\u00e1tico revelaram um efeito sinerg\u00e9tico nas propriedades mec\u00e2nicas das \nfibras celul\u00f3sicas, em especial nas fibras recicladas. Este facto foi relacionado \ncom o aumento de acessibilidade nas fibras para com a xilanase, como \nconsequ\u00eancia da hidrata\u00e7\u00e3o for\u00e7ada e rearranjo favor\u00e1vel das fibrilas originado \npela UHP. A melhoria registada nas propriedades mec\u00e2nicas das fibras, como \nresultado do pr\u00e9-tratamento UHP e posterior tratamento enzim\u00e1tico, foi at\u00e9 \n30%, tendo demonstrado maior impacto nas propriedades de \u00edndices de tra\u00e7\u00e3o \ne rebentamento. \nA impregna\u00e7\u00e3o de corantes com UHP tamb\u00e9m foi realizada e demonstrou uma \nmelhor impregna\u00e7\u00e3o/fixa\u00e7\u00e3o das mol\u00e9culas de corante. No entanto, verificou-\nse uma grande depend\u00eancia no equil\u00edbrio entre mol\u00e9culas de corante, fixador e \nfibras celul\u00f3sicas, dependendo no corante utilizado, com e sem alta press\u00e3o. \nEstas varia\u00e7\u00f5es foram atribu\u00eddas \u00e0 especificidade da estrutura molecular da \nmol\u00e9cula de corante, \u00e0 sua afinidade, substantividade, etc. \nA impregna\u00e7\u00e3o de agentes humectantes com UHP tamb\u00e9m foi avaliada e a \nmelhoria nas propriedades hidrof\u00edlicas de fibras celul\u00f3sicas foi confirmada. \nEste facto foi evidenciado por testes de capilaridade, sor\u00e7\u00e3o de vapor de \u00e1gua \ne testes de capacidade de sor\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua.  \nO efeito da UHP na impregna\u00e7\u00e3o de um agente antimicrobiano tamb\u00e9m foi \nestudado utilizando polihexametileno biguanide (PHMB). Sendo um pol\u00edmero \ncati\u00f3nico, o PHMB foi facilmente absorvido pelas fibras celul\u00f3sicas, com e sem \nalta press\u00e3o. A UHP permitiu ainda uma melhor impregna\u00e7\u00e3o/reten\u00e7\u00e3o do \nPHMB, ap\u00f3s lixivia\u00e7\u00e3o, quando comparado com a amostra impregnada sem \nUHP. Estes resultados foram relacionados com as fortes intera\u00e7\u00f5es \nestabelecidas entre o PHMB cati\u00f3nico e a celulose, devido a uma impregna\u00e7\u00e3o \nmais profunda do agente antimicrobiano durante o tratamento de UHP. No \nentanto, o teor de PHMB a impregnar nas fibras \u00e9 limitado pelos efeitos \nnegativos que este originou nas fibras como consequ\u00eancia da sua a\u00e7\u00e3o de \ninterrup\u00e7\u00e3o das liga\u00e7\u00f5es entre fibras como \u201cagente desligante\u201d. \nDo mesmo modo, c\u00e1psulas de s\u00edlica com PHMB tamb\u00e9m demonstraram uma \nmaior reten\u00e7\u00e3o nas fibras celul\u00f3sicas com a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o da UHP. Encapsulado, o \nPHMB n\u00e3o est\u00e1 diretamente em contacto com a celulose (intera\u00e7\u00f5es \nelectroest\u00e1ticas), exibindo deste modo uma maior liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de PHMB \n(limita\u00e7\u00e3o por difus\u00e3o). \nA impregna\u00e7\u00e3o com perfumes (Dovena New) encapsulados tamb\u00e9m foi \nrealizada e revelou uma maior impregna\u00e7\u00e3o destas nanoestrutras, com a \nutiliza\u00e7\u00e3o da UHP, relativamente \u00e0 metodologia convencional. Isto foi refletido \npela maior liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de vol\u00e1teis por parte das amostras impregnadas com \nc\u00e1psulas com perfumes. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nxix \n\n \n\nTable of Contents \n\nChapter I \u2013 Introduction.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...1 \n\n1.1.

Introduction \n\nTissue products market is the fastest growing market among industrially produced \n\npapers.\n[1,2]\n\n Examples of tissue papers include toilet paper, kitchen towels, napkins, facial \n\ntissue paper, etc. All these products have been demonstrating increasing demand in modern \n\nsocieties, as diary used products for personal hygiene, and also in numerous domestic or \n\nindustrial applications. \n\nSimilarly to other industries, an effective and sustainable development are in the \n\nfocus of tissue paper producers. This is particularly true for Renova a renowned Portuguese \n\ntissue paper producer. Renova is known not only for its high quality soft, absorbent tissue \n\npapers but also by its innovative products, such as black and strongly coloured toilet papers \n\nand napkins or facial papers with special features. \n\nFor the manufacture of tissue paper, Renova uses a wide variety of pulp sources. \n\nThese include primarily long (softwood) and short (hardwood) \u201cdried virgin\u201d fibres, but \n\nalso a wide range of recycled fibres (from printed to packing papers). The tissue papers \n\nfrom Renova contain up to 70-80% recycled fibres. Yet, recycled fibres utilization still \n\nexhibits some major drawbacks, relatively to virgin fibres, which imply the addition of \n\nvirgin fibres to surpass those limitations and maintain basic papers properties. Among the \n\nnegative factors affecting recycled pulp properties, the hornification effect is recognized as \n\nthe main responsible for recycled fibres losses (losses on physical and mechanical \n\nproperties and on fibres hydration abilities). \n[3\u201310]\n\n \n\nStudies previously carried out at the University of Aveiro have demonstrated the \n\npotential of hydrostatic ultra-high pressure to improve cellulosic fibres properties. In these \n\nstudies it was found that UHP was able to introduce water in inaccessible regions of \n\ncellulosic fibrils that resulted in fibril rearrangements, resulting in their higher \n\ncrystallization degree (larger crystallites), forced hydration (imprisonment of water \n\nmolecules as strongly bound water), improved accessibility (towards chemicals and \n\nenzymes) and as a consequence the reduction of pulps hornification, which limited pulps \n\nproperties, such as absorbency and mechanical properties.\n[11\u201313]\n\n, which are fairly relevant \n\nfor tissue papers. \n\nHence, the technique of hydrostatic ultra-high pressure is a suitable tool to improve \n\nproperties of recycled fibres towards a new generation of tissue papers. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 6 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter I | Introduction \n\n1.2. Contextualization and Objectives \n\nThe main goal of this work was the evaluation of hydrostatic ultra-high pressure, \n\nUHP, as a potential tool to enhance tissue paper properties. With this in mind, the main \n\npurposes of this study were to investigate the effect of ultra-high pressure on different \n\ntypes of fibres, commonly used by Renova for tissue paper production, recycled fibres and \n\nvirgin fibres (hardwoods and softwoods) and recycled fibres. \n\nAccording to results of previous works\n[11\u201313]\n\n, the effect of UHP on Renova feedstock \n\nmaterials, commonly used for tissue productions, was investigated. The UHP effect was \n\nevaluated as concerns structural changes of fibres, its capacity towards hydration, fibres \n\naccessibility, etc. In this context, high expectation was laid on recycled fibres treatment \n\nwith UHP.  \n\nSince recycled fibres are heavily affected by hornification it was important to \n\nevaluate UHP effects on hornified fibres\n[13,11,12]\n\n, including their physico-chemical \n\nproperties heavily affected by hornification. Besides, by reversing hornification the \n\npossibility of radical improvement of papermaking properties of recycled fibres in tissue \n\npaper production was also investigated. \n\nBesides recycle fibres, UHP effect on \u201cvirgin\u201d dried but never used in papermaking \n\npulps was also studied. Such virgin fibres are commonly used in the composition of tissue \n\npapers to provide critical properties such as absorbency, softness and adequate mechanical \n\nstrength.\n[14\u201316]\n\n The main idea was to verify if UHP treatment could improve the \n\naforementioned pulp properties thus diminishing the dependence of tissue paper \n\ncomposition from virgin pulps. It was expected that under optimized UHP conditions the \n\nforced hydration of virgin fibres would provide structural changes favouring their \n\nmechanical, optical, adsorption and softness properties.\n[13]\n\n The combination of beating and \n\nUHP was also considered to evaluate the effects behind the combination of both \n\ntreatments. \n\nTaking into consideration that the strategic development lines of Renova are related \n\nto the production of strongly coloured tissue papers with specific consumer properties (e.g. \n\nhighly absorbable, antimicrobial, perfumed, etc), the effect of UHP treatment on the dyeing \n\nprocess and on the accessibility towards various additives (antimicrobial agents, functional \n\nnanoparticles, humectants, fragrances and enzymes) was also evaluated. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 7 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter I | Introduction \n\n1.3.

Cellulosic fibres sources \n\nCellulose is one of the most abundant polymers in nature. This polymer is found in \n\ndifferent terrestrial plants in different amounts, e.g. more than 94% in cotton, 75-80% in \n\nhemp, 70-80% in flax, 60-65% in jute and 40-55% in wood. From all these cellulose \n\nsources, wood is the most relevant, since it is the main source of cellulosic pulp for \n\npapermaking.\n[1,2]\n\n \n\n2.1.1. Macroscopic structure of wood \n\nWood is composed by a wide variety of tissues cells (Figure 2. 1). When a tree is cut \n\nby taking a closer look into its cross-section, from its outside to the inside, it is possible to \n\ndistinguish different layers, the outer bark, the phloem, cambium, sapwood and heartwood. \n\nThe outbark confers protection and avoids liquid losses, while phloem is the cells tissue \n\nresponsible for transporting the nutrients through the plant. In the case of cambium, this \n\nlayer is responsible for the growth (i.e. cell division, production of xylem and phloem). \n\nThe new cells inside the cambium become cells in sapwood, and outside cells became cells \n\nin the phloem.  \n\nSapwood and heartwood are the tissues responsible for nutrients transport and \n\nstrength and support, respectively. Xylem (layer created from the cambium to the centre) is \n\nthe most important part of wood for paper industry. It mainly consists on longitudinal cells, \n\nwhose primary functions are conduction, support and nutrient storage, as mentioned above. \n\nAlso, radially oriented cells may be observed. In the xylem, the layers of early and late \n\nwood form well visible annual rings.\n[3\u20135]\n\n  \n\n \n\nFigure 2. 1 \u2013 Transverse cut of a wood stem. \n[6]\n\n \n\n2.1.2. Microscopic structure of wood \n\nWood cells are not all equal, they differ from tree to tree species. From these \n\ndifferences it is thus possible to divide wood into two types, hardwoods and softwoods.\n[7,8]\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 14 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\n2.1.2.1. Softwood \n\nSoftwood belong to coniferous (gymnosperms) and is mainly composed by two types \n\nof wood cells, tracheids (90-95%) and ray parenchyma cells (5-10%) (Figure 2. 2).\n[8]\n\n  \n\nTracheids are long cells, featured by its length being much larger than its width. \n\nTheir functions include mechanical support and water and nutrient transport. The water \n\ntransport between cells occurs through pits. Being longitudinally orientated, cells exhibit \n\nmany pits, which enable communication between neighbouring cells.\n[4,8]\n\n \n\nRay cells are barely visible and appear as lines in a top-to bottom directions. They \n\nhave approximately 15?m high by 10 ?m wide by 150-250?m long in the radial direction. \n\nThese cells functions include nutrient storage and its lateral transport. Ray cells intercept \n\ntracheids, trough pits, which act as communication between cells \n[4,7]\n\n  \n\n \n\nFigure 2. 2 \u2013 Typical softwood cells (adapted from \n[8]\n\n). \n\n2.1.2.2. Hardwoods \n\nHardwood belongs to angiospermes and possess a structure far more complex than \n\nthat of softwoods. All this complexity arises from the diversity of wood cells (Figure 2. 3), \n\nexistent in hardwood, with a wide variety of functions, comparatively to softwood. \n\nHardwood cells tissue consist mainly on libriform cells, (support function), vessels \n\n(transport function) and ray cells (storage function). It is also possible to find longitudinal \n\ntracheids (support function). \n[4,5,7,8]\n\n \n\nLibriform cells are long, with a quite thick cell wall, with small cavities with pits, \n\nwhile vessels are not quite long cells, and exhibit a large width and thin cell wall, with \n\nopened or perforated extremities. This last are found linked one after the other, forming \n\nchannels able to transport water in a more efficient way than tracheids on softwoods. \n\nVessels may exhibit length between 0.3mm and 0.6mm, and width between 30 and 300?m. \n\nIts dimension may vary depending on the hardwood species. \n[4,7,8]\n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 15 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\n \n\nFigure 2. 3- Typical hardwood cells (upper row left to right: aspen earlywood vessel; birch earlywood vessel; birch \n\nvessels united, birch libriform fibre; birch tracheid; oak tracheid. Lower row left to right: oak early and latewood vessels, \n\noak longitudinal parenchyma cells, birch ray parenchyma cell) (adapted from \n[8]\n\n). \n\n2.1.3. Wood cell structure \n\nIn wood cells, the cell wall is composed by several layers with distinct composition \n\nand organization. The thickness and percentage of each component may vary significantly \n\naccording to cell type, origin, type of wood, etc. \n[4,8,9]\n\n \n\nCell wall is divided into different layers, the middle lamella (ML), primary wall (P) \n\nand the secondary wall, which is formed by the outer (S1), middle (S2) and inner (S3) layers \n\n(Figure 2. 4).\n[4,5,8]\n\n Each layer is composed by a cellulose microfibril carcase, which is \n\narranged around the cell in different directions (Figure 2. 4) The microfibril orientation \n\ndiffers from layer to layer being close to 90\u00ba in S1 and S3 and 10-20\u00ba in S2. In the primary \n\nwall microfibrils are not oriented.\n[5,8]\n\n \n\nWood cells are glued together by means of the middle lamella, being this layer \n\nprimal function cell adhesion. In its earliest stages it is mainly composed of peptides, \n\nevolving then into a highly lignified structure. The lignin content in this layer is the highest \n\nbeing 90-100%. \n[5,8]\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. 4- Wood cell wall layers and its orientation, where ML is the middle lamella, P is the primary cell wall, S1 is the \n\nsecondary cell wall exterior layer; S2 is the secondary cell wall middle layer and S3 is the secondary wall inner layer. \n[5,8]\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 16 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nThe primary wall is the outer layer of cell wall, and consists on a thin layer, whose \n\ncomposition includes, mainly, cellulose, hemicelluloses, pectin and proteins, under a lignin \n\nmatrix. On its most external part cellulose microfibrils are organized randomly, while in \n\nthe interior they are orientated nearly perpendicularly to the cell axis.\n[5,8]\n\n  \n\nThe secondary wall, as mention before, can be divided into three layers, one thinner \n\nand more exterior, S1; an interior layer, S3 and a middle layer, S2 (Figure 2. 4). All layers \n\nare composed of microfibrils, embedded in a matrix of lignin and hemicelluloses.\n[8]\n\n The \n\nouter layer, S1, is rather thin (0.2-0.3?m thick). Here microfibrils orientation is almost \n\nhorizontal, with respect to cell axis, while in S2 it takes almost vertical orientation, \n\nfollowed once more by horizontal orientation, on S3.\n[5,8]\n\n All these layers, have distinct \n\ncomposition, composed essentially by cellulose in a matrix of hemicelluloses and \n\nlignin.\n[4,5,8]\n\n \n\n2.1.4. Wood composition \n\nThe chemical composition of wood cells varies significantly depending on the \n\nspecies. The amount of each compound may differ according with various factors such as, \n\nthe tree age, the type of wood, the part of the tree (leaf, stem, root), geographic \n\nlocalization, climate, soil, etc. Nevertheless, overall, wood is best described as a composite \n\nmade of cellulose networks, glued with lignin and hemicellulose, with minor amounts of \n\nextractives and inorganics.\n[9,10]\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. 5 \u2013 Cellulose partial structure. \n[9] \n\nCellulose is the main constituent of wood, and it consists on a linear polymer made \n\nof ?-D-glucopyranose units (Figure 2. 5). Its polymerization degree may go up to 10 000. \n\nOn the other hand, hemicelluloses, are a group of lower weight polymers, made of \n\ndifferent sugars units, such as D-glucose, D-mannose, D-galactose, D-xylose, L-arabinose, \n\nD-glucuronic acid and other less abundant sugars such as L-rhamnose or D-fucose (Figure \n\n2. 6). \n[9]\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 17 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\n \n\nFigure 2. 6 - Sugar monomers from wood hemicellulose (the designations D (dextrogyre) and L (levogyre) refers to the \n\nstandard configurations for the two optical isomers of glyceraldehyde, the simplest carbohydrate, and designate the \n\nconformation of the OH group at carbon 4 (C-4) for pentoses (xylose and arabinose) and C-5 for hexoses (glucose, \n\ngalactose, and mannose). Also, greek letters ? and ? refer to the configuration of OH group on C-1. The two \n\nconfigurations are called anomers.) (adapted from \n[9]\n\n). \n\nThere are several groups of hemicelluloses found in wood. Their constitution may \n\ninclude one or more types of sugars, and their designation is often formulated in agreement \n\nwith their predominant sugar monomers, for example, galactoglucomanans, \n\narabinoglucuronoxylans, glucomanans, glucoronoxylans, etc (Figure 2. 7). \n[3,9,11]\n\n \n\nIn hardwood, 4-O-methyl-glucuronoxylans, known as glucuronoxylans or xylans, are \n\na class of predominant hemicelluloses on this type of wood (ca. 15-30% on wood). Its \n\nbackbone is constituted by ?-D-xylose linked by ??1-4) bonds, with acetyl groups at C-2 or \n\nC-3 of the xylose units on an average of 5-7 acetyls per ten xylose units. This polymer is \n\nalso substituted with sidechains of 4-O-methylglucuronic acid units linked to the \n\nhemicellulose backbone by ?(1-2) links with an average frequency of approximately one \n\nuronic acid group per ten xylose units. \n[9\u201311]\n\n Besides xylans, in hardwood, it is also possible \n\nto find glucomanans, (approximately 2-5%), which comprises a polymer constituted by D-\n\nglucose and D-mannose units, with an approximate ratio of 1:1 to 1:2. \n[4,8]\n\n \n\nIn softwoods galactoglucomanans are predominant hemicelluloses, accounting for \n\napproximately, 20%. This polymer may be linear or slightly branched, and its backbone is \n\nconstituted of D-glucose and D-mannose units, linked by ?(1-4) bonds with a molar ratio \n\nof 1:2 to 1:3, with branches containing galactose linked to the main backbone by ?(1-6) \n\nbonds.\n[10,11]\n\n \n\nXylans from softwood are arabinoglucuronoxylans. This polymer backbone consists \n\nof D-xylose units linked by ?(1-4) links and branched with 4-O-methyl\u2013?-D-\n\n\n\n \n\n~ 18 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nglucopyranosyl uronic acid (linked by ?(1-2) links to the backbone) and branched with \n\nterminal L-arabinofuranose (linked through ?(1-3)links). \n[9,11]\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. 7 \u2013 Structures of hemicelluloses commonly found on hardwood and softwood (adapted from \n[10]\n\n). \n\nBesides hemicelluloses, lignin is another major component of wood. It consists of a \n\nbranched, amorphous polymer, obtained by radical polymerization of coniferyl, sinapyl \n\nand p-cumaryl alcohols (Figure 2. 8), where all phenylpropane units are linked by ether \n\nand carbon-carbon links. The most abundant bonds in lignin are ?-O-4 (40-60%), ?-5\u2019(5-\n\n10%), ?-?\u2019(5-15%), 5-5\u2019(5-15%) and 4-O-5\u2019 (2-8%).\n[12,13]\n\n \n\nLignin is distributed through all wood tissues, however, as previously mentioned, its \n\nconcentration is the highest in the middle lamella. It plays a role as a glue in the cell wall \n\ncontaining cellulose fibrils.\n[8,14]\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. 8- Lignin precursors p-comaryl alcohol (1), coniferyl alcohol (2) and sinapyl alcohol (3).\n[12]\n\n  \n\nWood also contains small amounts of extractives, which consist mainly of fatty \n\nacids, resins, esters, wax, fats, polyphenolics and terpenes.\n[3,9,15]\n\n The general chemical \n\ncomposition of some wood and non-wood plants is presented in Table 2. 1.\n[2]\n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 19 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nTable 2. 1\u2013 Chemical composition of different cellulosic materials.

Cellulose \n\nCellulose is a linear natural homopolymer composed of D-anhydroglucopyranose \n\nunits (AGU), which are linked together by ??1-4) glycosidic linkages. Its linear structure is \n\nattributed to the type of linkages established between each AGU unit. The glucose residues \n\nare linked 180\u00b0 towards each other, making the repeated unit a cellobiose residue (dimer) \n\nrather than a glucose residue (Figure 2. 5). \n[11,17\u201319]\n\n \n\n2.1.5.1. Supramolecular structure \n\nBeing a linear polymer with multiple OH groups, cellulose chains exhibit a high \n\ntendency to interact with each other (by hydrogen bonds) forming molecule bundles. The \n\nformation of a cellulose bundle is often referred to as elementary fibrils. This group of \n\nmolecules, may be further divided into regions of higher or lower organization, crystalline \n\nand amorphous regions, respectively. Elementary fibril may also form aggregates, named \n\nmicrofibrils, which may also do the same, yielding macrofibrils (Figure 2. 9 and \n\n2.11Figure 2. 10). \n[8,19,20]\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. 9 - Scheme illustrating the arrangement of cellulose units in the plant cell wall (adapted from \n[21]\n\n). \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 20 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\n \n\nFigure 2. 10- Amorphous and crystalline regions in elementary fibrils (adapted from \n[22]\n\n and \n[23]\n\n ). \n\nThe surface of cellulose chains contain free OH groups, which are not only \n\nresponsible for cellulose supramolecular structure but also for its chemical and physical \n\nproperties. Hydroxyl groups interact with one another by hydrogen bonds, which \n\ncomprises most of cellulose supramolecular structure. In cellulose two types of hydrogen \n\nbonds may be distinguished, intramolecular bonds (bonds between OH groups of adjacent \n\nAGU units in the same cellulose molecule) and intermolecular bonds (bonds between OH \n\ngroups of adjacent cellulose molecules). While the first ones confer a certain stiffness to \n\nsingle chains, the second ones are responsible for the formation of cellulose \n\nsupramolecular structure. \n[20,23,24]\n\n \n\nInfrared spectroscopy (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and x-\n\nray diffraction (XRD) studies have enabled the identification of cellulose interactions and \n\norganization. \n[25]\n\n It has been demonstrated that cellulose establishes intramolecular bonds \n\nOH-3\u2026O5\u2019 and OH-2\u2026O6\u2019, which confer rigidity to the four ring layer configuration. \n\nIntermolecular hydrogen bonds OH-6\u2026O3, also play a key role, since they bond cellulose \n\nlayers laterally. \n[11,19,23,26,27]\n\n In Figure 2. 11 it possible to observe both inter and \n\nintramolecular bonds established by cellulose.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2. 11- Scheme illustrating the bondings between cellulose molecules (adapted from \n[9]\n\n). \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 21 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nAs the packing density of cellulose increases, crystalline regions are formed. The \n\npresence of crystalline regions on cellulosic materials brands it as paracrystalline and its \n\npercentage of crystalline material is usually around 60-70%. \n[9,19]\n\n \n\nIt is possible to find cellulose with different packing/conformations, and therefore \n\nwith different unit cell parameters. The unit cell is the basis building block of a crystal, \n\nrepeated infinitely in three dimensions. It is characterized by three vectors a, b and c and \n\nthe angles between the vectors, ? the angle between b and c; ?, the angle between a and c; \n\nand ?, the angle between a and b.\n[28]\n\n \n\nCellulose ability of exhibiting different conformations is a case of polymorphism, \n\nwhich in crystallography refers to the existence of more than one crystalline conformation. \n\nCellulose has many polymorphs (cellulose I, II, III and IV), however cellulose I is the \n\nnative predominant crystalline form of cellulose.\n[19,28,29]\n\n \n\nCellulose I or native cellulose molecules are organized on a monoclinic unit cell, \n\nwith two parallel running chains and with cell parameters a=8.35\u00c5, b=10.3\u00c5, c=7.9\u00c5 and \n\n?=96-97\u00ba (Figure 2. 11). \n[17,19,26]\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. 12 - Scheme illustrating cellulose monoclinic cell structure and its lattice planes (adapted from \n[19]\n\n). \n\nAs mentioned above, cellulose has many polymorphs, which exhibit different \n\ncellulose packing/organization. The type of conformation and packing displayed by \n\ncellulose chains differs from each polymorph and it may be accessed through the \n\naforementioned methods (XRD, IR and NMR). Small variations on the unit cell may be \n\nfound for the same polymorph depending on cellulose origin.\n[17,19,28]\n\n \n\nCellulose I is the native and predominate crystalline structure, although it can be \n\nconverted into the other polymorphs through a variety of treatments. Nevertheless, two \n\nforms of cellulose I exist, cellulose I? and cellulose I?. Cellulose I? appears dominantly in \n\nbacterial and algal celluloses and contains triclinic cell structure, while cellulose I? is \n\n20\n\n0 \n\n11\n\n0 \n\na = 0.85 \n\nnm \n\n1-10 ??=84\u00aa \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 22 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\npredominant in higher plants such as cotton and wood and contains monoclinic cells \n\nstructure.\n[19,27,29]\n\n \n\nCellulose I conformation may be altered, irreversibly, into other stable crystalline \n\nform, cellulose II. This process may be conducted by two distinct methods regeneration \n\nand mercerization. Regeneration process consists in the dissolution of cellulose with an \n\nappropriate solvent followed by its recrystallization. As for mercerization it is performed \n\nby inciting cellulose intracrystalline swelling with NaOH concentrated solutions, followed \n\nby its washing and recrystallization. The fact that the transition from cellulose I into \n\ncellulose II is irreversible, implies that cellulose II is a more stable form, with respect to \n\ncellulose I. \n[19,27,29]\n\n \n\nOther cellulose polymorphs may be prepared from cellulose I. Such is the case of \n\ncellulose III, which is obtained by treatment of cellulose I with liquid ammonia or certain \n\namines (e.g. ethylene diamine, EDA). Cellulose III may also be prepared from cellulose II. \n\nThe difference on the starting material (cellulose I or II) either renders cellulose IIII or \n\ncellulose IIIII, respectively. Additionally, by treating cellulose III with high temperature \n\nand glycerol it is possible to achieve cellulose IV polymorph. Hence, once more, two types \n\nmay be attained, either cellulose IVI or IVII, respectively, obtained from cellulose IIII and \n\nIIIII. \n[19,27,29]\n\n \n\n2.1.6. Cellulose accessibility and its interaction with water \n\nIn crystalline regions the interactions between cellulose chains are very strong, which \n\nexplains the high resistance of cellulosic fibres and its insolubility towards most solvents. \n\nOn the other hand, in its amorphous regions, the higher spacing between cellulosic chains \n\nand reduced organization enables a higher availability of free OH groups for interaction \n\nwith other molecules, such as water. The fact that cellulose has its hydrophilic groups \n\navailable, makes it highly hygroscopic, with high water absorption capacity.\n[9,30]\n\n \n\nAs previously referred, cellulose in wood may be crystalline and amorphous and thus \n\ninaccessible and accessible. Accessibility refers to the availability of cellulose functional \n\ngroups to water, chemicals, microorganisms, etc. Even though crystalline cellulose is \n\ninaccessible, its surface is accessible. Moreover, most of amorphous cellulose is accessible \n\nbut is also covered with hemicelluloses and lignin, which affects negatively its \n\naccessibility. \n[9,19,30,31]\n\n \n\nCellulose accessibility has been investigated by many researchers considering \n\ndifferent techniques, such as X-ray diffraction, absorption of infrared radiation, or even \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 23 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nexchange of hydroxyl hydrogen for deuterium or tritium.\n[9,19,30\u201334]\n\n However, only moisture \n\nsorption isotherms will be further discussed in detail. \n\n2.1.6.1. Moisture sorption \n\nAs mentioned above accessibility may be evaluated considering sorption experiments \n\nwith inert gases (N2 or Ar) or with water vapour. In case of water, this last is able to \n\ninteract with cellulose, by disrupting weaker hydrogen bond, not being able, however, to \n\ninterfere with intern crystalline regions. The moisture uptake at certain conditions \n\n(temperature and relative humidity) is a rather relevant criteria when evaluating cellulosic \n\nfibres interaction with water. \n[19,35]\n\n \n\nThe determination of water vapour or moisture sorption isotherms is often used not \n\nonly to evaluate materials accessibility, but also to analyse materials hydration. This \n\ninformation becomes crucial regarding the papermaking applications, when the hydration \n\nabilities of cellulosic fibres predetermines the fibres properties. \n[19,36]\n\n The composition of a \n\ncellulosic pulp, the presence of oxidised functional groups, fibres porosity, its surface area \n\nand its hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity are rather relevant factors, which may influence \n\nmoisture sorption. Therefore, this method works as an indirect tool to evaluate the \n\naccessibility of free OH groups in fibres. \n[37]\n\n \n\nMoisture sorption isotherm may be determined by means of three different \n\nmeasuring techniques: gravimetric, manometric or hygrometric methods. In the \n\ngravimetric method, the weight of the sample is measured using a scale, while in the \n\nmanometric method, the vapour pressure of water is measured when it is in equilibrium \n\nwith a sample at given moisture content. In the hygrometric methods, the equilibrium \n\nrelative humidity with a sample at a given moisture content is measured.\n[38] \n\nMoisture sorption isotherms can be achieved from completely dried samples, under \n\nan environment with controlled humidity, until equilibria is reached. The data is afterwards \n\nrepresented as moisture uptake at equilibrium (Xeq), as a function of water activity (aw), or \n\nrelative humidity (RH%). In Equation 2.1 it is possible to observe the relationship between \n\naw and RH%. \n[37,38]\n\n \n\n?? =\n??%\n\n100\n   Equation 2. 1 \n\nMaterials water sorption is a process where water molecules progressively and \n\nreversibly combine with a material by chemisorption, physical adsorption, and multilayer \n\ncondensation. An isotherm may assume the shape represented in Figure 2. 13 and it may be \n\ndivided into three main regions. Region A represents strongly bound water (which includes \n\nstructural water and monolayer water), whose enthalpy of vaporization is higher than that \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 24 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nof pure water. Theoretically, in this layer the moisture content comprises the first layer of \n\nwater molecules, which are sorbed by hydrophilic and polar groups of materials. These \n\nwater molecules are unfreezable and hence not available for reaction or as plasticizers (the \n\ndifferent types of water in cellulose will be further discussed later on 2.1.6.2.).\n[19,37,38]\n\n \n\nRegion B represents the multilayer region, where water molecules are fairly strongly \n\nbound, on multiple layers but, not in direct contact with the adsorbent surface.\n[39]\n\n Bonds \n\nare less intense, yet with an enthalpy of vaporization still higher than that of pure water. \n\nThis region can be seen as a transition region from bound to free water. Here water \n\nmolecules properties are closer to those of free water, and are available as solvent for low-\n\nmolecular weight solutes and for some biochemical reactions. Also, water molecules from \n\nthis region usually do not freeze at normal freezing point.\n[37,38]\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. 13 - Representation of a moisture sorption isotherm and the hysteresis phenomena associated with it (adapted \n\nfrom \n[38]\n\n). \n\nIn region C it is represented the region of capillary condensation, where the sorbed \n\nwater is not bound by surface forces and is free to condense as liquid phase, within the \n\nmolecular capillaries. The properties of water molecules start approaching those of bulk \n\nwater. \n[37\u201339]\n\n \n\nBetween sorption and desorption (Figure 2. 13) the occurrence of hysteresis may be \n\nrelated with the nature and state of the components of materials, reflecting their potential \n\nfor structural and conformational rearrangements, which alters the accessibility of \n\nenergetically favourable polar sites. \n[35,37]\n\n \n\nMoisture sorption isotherms may be classified according with Brunauer et al.\n[40]\n\n and \n\ntherefore be divided into five types (I, II, III, IV and V). \n[40,41]\n\n Type I isotherms, often \n\nreferred to as Langmuir isotherms (monolayer coverage), are concave to aw axis and \n\napproach a limiting value as aw?1. This isotherm is typical on microporous materials. \n[40\u2013\n\n\n\n \n\n~ 25 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\n42]\n Type II isotherms are the usual on non-porous or macroporous adsorbents. Thus \n\nrepresent unrestricted monolayer-multilayer adsorption. The border between region A and \n\nB, is often taken to indicate the stage at which monolayer coverage is complete and \n\nmultilayer adsorption is about to begin. It is typical on hydrophilic materials, such as \n\ncellulose, and is indicative if strong adsorbate-adsorbent interactions.\n[41\u201343]\n\n Type III \n\nisotherms are convex to aw axis over its entire range and therefore do not exhibit \n\nmonolayer. This type of isotherm suggests a hydrophobic surface, reluctant to accept \n\nwater. It shows weak interaction between adsorbate and surface.\n[41\u201343]\n\n Type IV isotherm \n\nare typical on mesoporous materials. The initial part of this isotherm is attributed to \n\nmonolayer-multilayer adsorption, since it follows the same path as the corresponding part \n\nof a type II isotherm, but at higher aw the isotherm tends to a plateau. It reflects capillary \n\ncondensation which result in effective reduction of available surface for further \n\nadsorption.\n[41,42,44]\n\n Type V isotherms are uncommon and related with type III, with weak \n\nadsorbent-adsorbate interaction. They occur in porous adsorbents (either meso or \n\nmicroporous), such as the case of highly porous hydrophobic carbon materials with water \n\nvapour. Similarly to type IV, it represents mono and multilayer adsorption plus capillary \n\ncondensation. \n[41,42,44]\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. 14 \u2013 Types of isotherms according with Brunauer et al.(adapted from\n[38]\n\n). \n\nMoisture sorption isotherms can be described by mathematical models, which are \n\nable to fit moisture sorption isotherms data in different environmental conditions. Many \n\nmodel equations have been developed and the approaches vary from empirical curve fitting \n\nto models based on various degrees of understanding of the mechanisms involved.\n[36]\n\n \n\nHowever, no model can be considered completely accurate, since for different water \n\nactivities, different mechanisms of water molecules association may occur.\n[36,37,45]\n\n \n\nNumerous models can be found on literature, and these may be discriminated \n\naccording with its main fundamentals (Table 2. 2), such as, models based on monolayer \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 26 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\n(e.g. BET model), models based on multilayer (e.g. GAB model), semi-empirical models \n\n(Henderson and Halsey model) and empirical models (e.g. Oswin model). \n[36,37,45]\n\n \n\nTable 2. 2 \u2013 Examples of some moisture sorption isotherm models.\n[37,38,45] \n\nModel Equation Observations \n\nBET (Brunauer, \n\nEmmett e Teller) \n??? =\n\n?????\n(1 ? ??)(1 ? ?? + ???)\n\n \n\n-Langmuir mechanism; \n\n-Monolayer; \n\n- 0,05<aw<0,5; \n\nGAB (Guggenhein-\n\nAnderson-de Boer) \n??? =\n\n??????\n(1 ? ???)(1 ? ??? + ????)\n\n \n\n- Monolayer formation, followed by \n\nmultilayer formation; \n\n-usually applied between 0.1<aw<0,9 \n\nHalsey ?? = ???(\n??\n\n??\n) \n\n-Semi-empirical \n\n- 0.1<aw<0,9 \n\n- Molecules potential energy varies with \n\nthe potency of the distance to the surface; \n\n-Sigmoidal \n\nHenderson ??? = [\nln?(1 ? ??)\n\n??\n]\n\n1\n??\n\n \n\n- Semi-empirical \n\n- Sigmoidal \n\nPELEG ??? = ?1??\n?1 + ?2??\n\n?2 \n\n- Semi-empirical \n\n- Sigmoidal or not; \n\n-very versatile; \n\n-Good for polymers such as starch \n\nOswin ??? = ?[\n??\n\n1 ? ??\n]\n?\n\n \n\n- Empirical \n\n- Sigmoidal \n\n-0.1<aw<0,9; \n\nSmith \n??? = ? + ????(1 ? ??) \n\n \n\n-Empirical \n\n- Biological materials such as starch  \n\n- 0.1<aw<0,9; \n\nIn case of cellulosic materials BET and GAB models, especially GAB, have \n\ndemonstrated rather good ability to fit and describe moisture sorption data on different \n\ncellulosic materials. \n[36,46]\n\n \n\nBrunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET ) model \n[47]\n\n, was proposed in 1938, and is widely \n\nused in food science. Its versatility allows to describe moisture sorption on different \n\nmaterials. It is typically used to describe type II and III isotherms, and from it, it is possible \n\nto estimate the monolayer coverage. However, only at water activities inferior to 0.45. \n\n[42,48]\n Its principles are based on the following hypothesis, (i) the rate of condensation on \n\nthe first layer is equal to the rate of evaporation from the second layer, (ii) the binding \n\nenergy of all of the adsorbate on the first layer is the same, and (ii) the binding energy of \n\nthe other layers is equal to that of pure adsorbate.\n[36,42,45]\n\n \n\nBET equation is represented in Table 2. 2, where Xeq is the moisture uptake at \n\nequilibrium, Xm is the monolayer moisture content, aw the water activity, and C a constant. \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 27 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nGuggenheim, Anderson and de Boer isotherm model (GAB), is also a well-known \n\nand quite versatile model, not only widely used on food science, but also for cellulosic \n\nmaterials. It is considered to be a refinement of Langmuir and BET theories, with three \n\nparameters, with physical meaning. \n[36,42,45,49]\n\n \n\nIn Table 2. 2 is represented GAB model equation, which is much similar to that of \n\nBET. Similarly to BET, Xeq is the moisture uptake at equilibrium, Xm is the monolayer \n\nmoisture content, aw the water activity, and C and k are constants. When k=1, GAB model \n\nturns into BET model. \n[36,42,45,49]\n\n \n\nFrom parameter Xeq, it is also possible to estimate the sorbent\u2019s specific surface area \n\n(S, m\n2\n/gsolid) as displayed by Equation 2.2, where Mw is the adsorbate molecular weight, Na \n\nthe Avogadro number, and Am is the effective cross-sectional area of the adsorbate \n\nmolecule (0.125nm\n2\n for water at 298 K). \n\n[50]\n \n\n? = ?? [\n????\n\n??\n]   Equation 2. 2 \n\nAs mentioned previously, GAB parameters have a physical interpretation. Parameter \n\nC represents a dimensionless parameter related with the heat of sorption of monolayer, i.e. \n\nit is a way of accessing the strength of binding between water and primary binding sites. \n\nHigher values of C, suggest stronger interactions between water molecules from the \n\nmonolayer and the sorbent surface.\n[37,42,49]\n\n \n\nParameter k, it is also a dimensionless parameter, but now related with the heat of \n\nsorption of the multilayer. When k approaches 1, there is almost no distinction between \n\nmultilayer molecules and liquid ones. Under this circumstance water molecules past the \n\nmonolayer are not organized in multilayer, however, exhibit similar features of those from \n\nliquid water. On the other hand, the more molecules are organized in multilayer, lower is k. \n\nThe temperature dependence is also considered on GAB parameters C and k, this \n\ndependence is shown by Equations 2.3 and 2.4.\n[37,42,49]\n\n  \n\nC =\nq1\n\nqm\n= C0 ? exp(\n\n?Hc\n\nRT\n),with??Hc = Hm ? Hq  Equation 2. 3 \n\nk =\nql\n\nqm\n= k0 ? exp(\n\n?Hk\n\nRT\n),with??Hk = Hl ? Hq   Equation 2. 4 \n\n Here C0 and k0 are constants of entropic nature. The first is defined as the \n\naccommodation function between the first layer and multilayer, while the second \n\nrepresents the accommodation function between bulk water and multilayer. Usually C0 \n\nexhibits values smaller than 1, due to molecules preference for the multilayer, while k0 \n\nvalues are expected to be higher than 1, due to the high entropy of molecules in \n\nliquid.\n[37,42,49]\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 28 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nParameters ?Hc and ?Hk represent the difference in enthalpy between monolayer \n\n(H1) and multilayer (Hq), and the difference in enthalpy between bulk water (Hl) and \n\nmultilayer (Hq), respectively. The first is usually positive, given the exothermic nature of \n\nwater and primary site for sorption, while the other is often negative and smaller, since the \n\nmultilayer molecules are bound more loosely. Nevertheless, positive values are possible \n\nand have been observed in some foods as the result of endothermic dissolution of fruit \n\nsugars. \n[37,49]\n\n  \n\nThe heat involved in the sorption of moisture can also be estimated. The net isosteric \n\nheat of sorption (?Hs) evaluates the binding energy existing between the water molecules \n\n(vapour state) and the sorbent. It is derived according to the Clausiys-Clayperon equation \n\n(Equation 2.5) for constant moisture. From this parameter it is also possible to determine \n\ntotal heat of sorption, Qs, by adding the heat of water vaporization (?Hv), (Equation 2.6). \n\n[37,49]\n \n\n??? = ?R(\n?lnaw\n\n?T?1\n)\nXeq\n\n   Equation 2. 5 \n\n?? =??Hs + ?Hv   Equation 2. 6 \n\nParameters ?Hc and ?Hk determined from Equations 2.3 and 2.4, also allow a \n\ntheoretical estimate of the net isosteric heat of sorption, which is given by the relationship \n\ndisplayed on Equation 2.7. \n\n?Hs,t = ?Hc + (??Hk)  Equation 2. 7 \n\n2.1.6.1.1. States of water \n\nWater may be found associated with different materials differently, namely, either on \n\nin its free or bound form.\n[35,51]\n\n Bound water exhibits different properties, relatively to that \n\nof free water. It is noteworthy the reduced mobility of the first relatively to the second, due \n\nto its bound situation. As concerns cellulose, water molecules mobility is restrained by the \n\npresence of cellulose OH groups, with which they interact. Some features of this kind of \n\nwater include lower vapour pressure, superior bounding energy, reduced mobility, inability \n\nto freeze at low temperatures and unavailability to act as solvent.\n[35,51]\n\n \n\nBound water may by further subcategorized into nonfreezing bound water and \n\nfreezing bound water. Nonfreezing bound water consists on water molecules that are not \n\ndetected during DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) and may be determined by the \n\ndifference between the total water measured gravimetrically and the amount of water \n\ndetected by DSC analysis. When considering water sorption at the fibres surface, it is \n\npossible that the first, up to the three first layers of water bound to cellulosic fibres surface, \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 29 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nare not able to freeze. This inability is related with the limitations under water molecules \n\nmotion imposed by the interactions with cellulosic fibres surface. \n[35,51,52]\n\n \n\nAs regards freezing bound water, contrarily to the previous case, a phase-transition is \n\nobserved, but at temperatures lower than that of bulk water. Since, the strength of the \n\nhydration interaction decreases with the distance from the material surface, so water \n\nmolecules associated with the surface may be frozen at lower temperatures. Studies to \n\naccess materials states of water may be carried out through methods such as DSC or NMR. \n\n[35,51,52]\n \n\n2.2. Paper feedstocks \n\nIn pulp and paper industry the feedstock used may vary greatly. It mainly consists on \n\nfibrous raw material which may include primary or secondary fibres. Being primary fibres \n\nobtained directly from plant raw materials (mainly from wood or other non-wood plants) \n\nand secondary fibres being produced from recovered paper.\n[53]\n\n Considering the feedstocks \n\nused for each type of fibres production, these will be divided respectively into virgin fibres \n\nand recycled fibres. \n\n2.2.1. Virgin pulps \n\nWood is the main raw material used to produce cellulosic pulp. Pulping processes are \n\nused to produce cellulosic pulp, and its main purpose consists on liberating cellulosic fibres \n\nfrom the wood matrix. In principal, this can be achieved by mechanical, chemi-mechanical, \n\nsemi-chemical and chemical pulping processes. Additionally, depending on pulps end-use, \n\na bleaching process may follow the pulping process, in order to improve its brightness. \n[54\u2013\n\n57]\n \n\n2.2.1.1. Mechanical and chemi-mechanical pulps \n\nMechanical pulping is the original form of pulping. It separates fibres from each \n\nother by using only mechanical attrition to wood, with no chemicals (other than water or \n\nsteam).\n[56\u201359]\n\n The aim of mechanical pulping resides in maintaining the main part of lignin \n\n(and other wood components) to achieve high yield pulp, with satisfactory strength and \n\nbrightness properties. Mechanical pulping processes exhibit pulp yields of about 90-98%, \n\ndepending on what mechanical pulping method is being used. However, it usually requires \n\nhigh amount of energy when compared to chemical pulping. \n[54,57,58]\n\n \n\nMechanical pulps are featured as high yield (high wood components content), high \n\nbulk, high stiffness, and low cost pulps. Their low strength is associated with lignin \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 30 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\ninterference with interfibre bonding. The presence of high lignin content may also cause \n\npulp to turn yellow upon light or air exposure. \n[57,58]\n\n \n\nFurthermore, apart from fibres, mechanical pulp is also known to display a \n\nconsiderate content of smaller structures named fines (pieces from fibres wall and broken \n\nfibres), which are responsible for mechanical pulps optical properties. \n[54,56\u201358]\n\n \n\nThe main processes applied for mechanical pulp production include stone \n\ngroundwood pulping (SGW), pressure groundwood pulping (PGW), refiner mechanical \n\npulping (RMP), thermo-mechanical pulping (TMP), or chemi-thermo-mechanical pulping \n\n(CTMP). \n[56,57][55]\n\n \n\nGroundwood mechanical pulp is produced by grinding wood logs, with grindstones \n\non the tangential and radial surfaces (SGW). It may also be prepared by pressurizing the \n\ngrinder with steam at temperatures of 105-125\u00b0C. In this case wood is heated and softened \n\nbefore the grinding process, to improve the separation of fibres with less fibres cutting and \n\nless fines generation (PGW). Another example of mechanical pulping is the refiner pulping \n\nprocess (RMP), here pulp is produced by disintegration of chips that are fed to two refining \n\ndiscs, at atmospheric pressure conditions. \n[54,57][55]\n\n \n\nModifications on mechanical pulping methods may also be performed to produce \n\npulp with a higher amount of long fibres. In these processes lignin may be softened by \n\nincreasing process temperature. In this case wood chips are pre-treated with steam \n\n(approximately 120\u00baC), before entering the refiners (TMP). It is also possible to combine \n\nchemical treatments with mechanical pulping. In that case, wood chips are embedded with \n\nsodium sulfite solution to sulfonate lignin and to soften its structure, hence turning easier \n\nfibres separation (CTMP).\n[54,55,57]\n\n  \n\nDepending on the applications, it is also possible to brighten mechanical pulps with, \n\nfor example, hydrogen peroxide and/or sodium sulfite. These chemicals only brighten the \n\npulp and do not permanently bleach it.\n[58]\n\n \n\nThe use of mechanical pulps is confined mainly to non-permanent papers like \n\nnewsprint and catalogue paper. Mechanical pulps constitute 20-25% of the world \n\nproduction and this is increasing due to the high yield of the process and increasing \n\ncompetition for fibre resources. \n[57]\n\n \n\n2.2.1.2. Chemical pulp \n\nBesides mechanical pulping, cellulosic pulp may also be produced by chemical \n\npulping. In this process the main purpose consists on solubilizing and remove lignin from \n\nwood, so that very little mechanical treatment is required to separate wood fibres from \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 31 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\neach other. There is a wide variety of chemical pulping methods and each has its own \n\nspecific advantages and disadvantages. The most common pulping processes known \n\ninclude the soda pulping, kraft pulping and sulfite pulping, although the kraft process \n\naccounts for the major part of chemical pulps produced all over the word. \n[54,55,57]\n\n \n\nComparatively to previous mechanical pulping methods, pulps produced by chemical \n\npulping are more flexible, conform better to each other when forming paper and render \n\ngood strength properties. The cooking procedures may either be continuous or batch-wise. \n\n[54,55]\n  \n\nContrarily to mechanical pulping (high yield pulps) in chemical pulping, only \n\napproximately half of the wood becomes pulp, while the other part is removed. In this \n\nprocess, however, little electric energy is required for the process, since most of it is \n\nrecovered along with most of the cooking chemicals, thanks to efficient recovery \n\nsystems.\n[54]\n\n \n\nThe produced pulp is coloured, and its degree of colouring varies with the pulping \n\nprocess. To produce certain paper grades that require high brightness pulp is bleached.\n[54]\n\n \n\nAs regards the most commonly used chemical pulping processes these will be briefly \n\nscrutinized below. \n\ni) Soda pulping \n\nSoda pulping was one of the first chemical pulping methods invented and it uses \n\nsodium hydroxide for the chemical cooking process. After kraft process was discovered \n\nmost soda mills were converted to the kraft process. The soda process still has limited use \n\nfor easily pulped materials such as agriculture residues (e.g. straws) and some hardwoods, \n\nbut it has lost most of its importance. Soda pulping of woods is possible while using \n\nanthraquinones as catalyst.\n[57]\n\n \n\nii) Kraft pulping \n\nKraft cooking is the dominant chemical pulping method. In this process the cooking \n\nliquor consists of a mixture of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium sulfide (Na2S), \n\nwhere OH\n-\n and HS\n\n-\n are the cooking active species. Here, whereas the last plays a key role \n\non delignification, the other keeps lignin fragments in solutions. As previously mentioned, \n\nsodium hydroxide alone (soda process) was initially used as the alkaline pulping agent, \n\nhowever, with time, mills were then converted to the kraft process due to its ability to \n\nproduce superior pulp. \n[54,55,57]\n\n \n\nThe cooking procedure can either be continuous or batch-wise. In a typical \n\n\u201ccooking\u201d process, wood chips are first pre-steamed to turn wood chips \u201csofter\u201d and to \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 32 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nforce out any entrapped air. Then, they are combined with a highly alkaline solution, the \n\nwhite liquor, which contains sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide. All these ingredients \n\nare blended together in a digester, where they are pressurized and cooked at 160-170\u00baC, \n\nover several hours. During this time, reactants permeate wood chips and dissolve most of \n\nits non-fibrous contents. The cooking conditions may vary, depending on the wood type or \n\nthe desired pulp quality. \n[55,57,59]\n\n When finished the contents from the cooking process \n\n(pulp) are discharged from the digester into a blowtank. \n[54,57,59]\n\n \n\nOwing to the use of high amounts of chemicals, its recovery and reuse becomes \n\nessential, not only due to economical issues, but also due to environmental issues (residues \n\nmanagement). Therefore, in this process the inorganic chemicals, resultant from the \n\npulping process, are recovered and regenerated for reuse. Additionally, large amounts of \n\nheat energy are generated/produced from the black liquor combustion.\n[54,55,60]\n\n Typically, \n\npulp and its liquor (black liquor), after the \u201ccooking\u201d process, are separated in a washing \n\nprocess. While pulp proceeds into bleaching (in case of bleached pulp production), \"black \n\nliquor\u201d is sent off to multi-effect evaporators to be concentrated. This process concentrates \n\nthe dissolved organic matter (lignin and carbohydrate degradation products) leaving it in \n\nconditions to be burned in the recovery furnace. \n[55,60]\n\n The remaining NaOH and sodium \n\nsalts of organic acids are converted to Na2CO3. Also during the combustion sodium sulfate \n\nis reduced to sodium sulfide by the carbon (Equations 2.8 and 2.9). Usually, sodium sulfate \n\nis added as makeup, being then reduced to Na2S by carbon. \n[55,60]\n\n \n\n2NaOH + CO2 ? Na2CO3 + H2O   Equation 2. 8 \n\nNa2SO4 + 4C ? Na2S + 4CO  Equation 2. 9 \n\nAfterwards, the inorganic share on the bottom of the furnace (Na2CO3 and Na2S) is \n\ncollected and dissolved in water. Then, the mixture, now \"green liquor\", is sent into the \n\nslaker, to get in contact with slaked lime and to turn Na2CO3 into NaOH (Equation 2.10). \n\nSince Na2S does not react with lime, the mixture of NaOH and Na2S (\"white liquor\") can \n\nbe reused on another pulping process. \n[54,55,57,60]\n\n \n\n(Na2CO3 + Ca(OH)2 ? 2NaOH + CaCO3)  Equation 2. 10 \n\n \n\nFigure 2. 15 \u2013 Scheme of the stages involved on the recovery process of chemicals and energy in the kraft process.\n[54] \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 33 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nThe resultant CaCO3 sludge is filtered off, burned in a lime kiln, and reused. \n\nTherefore, the chemical system is closed, which minimizes costs and pollution.  \n\nNevertheless, the kraft process still exhibits serious issues as concerns air pollution. \n\nThese are essentially related with the release into the atmosphere of hydrogen sulfide, \n\nmercaptans, and other sulfur compounds, that exhibit a distinct bad odour. Still, the use of \n\nvarious techniques, such as black-liquor oxidation, improved evaporators and furnaces, and \n\ncontrol of emissions has been able to mitigate this negative outcome. \n[54,55,57,60]\n\n \n\nThe kraft process is rather versatile since it may be used in any type of wood pulping \n\nprocess. Additionally, it is able to produce pulps with high strength, with a good energy \n\nefficiency and chemicals recovery. Although the disadvantages of this process include \n\ndifficulties in the bleaching process comparatively to sulfite pulps, low yield (carbohydrate \n\nlosses) and odour problems related with the emission of sulfur based compounds, that can \n\nbe detected by the olfactory at 10 parts per billion. Although, as regards this last, it does \n\nnot appear that this process will be supplanted in the near future; instead, it seems more \n\nlikely to be improved and modified with time. \n[54,55,57]\n\n \n\niii) Sulfite pulping \n\nThe sulfite pulping process is an example of other chemical pulping process. Here \n\nlignin is dissolved by sulfonation with an aqueous solution of sulfur dioxide and calcium, \n\nsodium, magnesium, or ammonium bisulfite, cooked at high temperature and pressure in a \n\ndigester. Today, the dominating base used in sulfite pulping is magnesium.\n[61]\n\n Calcium \n\nrequires pH 2 to stay in solution, while magnesium allows pH values up to 4. In case of \n\nsodium and ammonium sulfite solutions these can be strongly alkaline without \n\nprecipitation. Acid processes are those in which pH is between 2 and 3, bisulfite processes \n\noperate at pH range of 3-5, neutral sulfite processes in the range of pH 6-9, and alkaline \n\nsulfite processes are above pH 11. \n[62]\n\n \n\nRegardless of the base used, the initial step of sulfite pulping consists on the \n\npreparation of the \u201ccooking\u201d liquor, which is commonly prepared at the mill by burning \n\nsulfur to produce SO2 and dissolving it in water to produce sulfurous acid (H2SO3). During \n\ncombustion of sulfur, it is imperative to regulate the amount of oxygen to guarantee a \n\ncomplete oxidation and avoid over oxidation (formation of SO3). The SO2 gas is then \n\nrapidly cooled down (to minimize SO3 formation, that originates sulfuric acid in water), \n\nprior to reaction with water. After cooling down, the SO2 gas must be absorbed in water \n\nand react with the proper base to form the cooking liquor. Equation 2.11 to 2.14 represent \n\nthe referred reactions, where M = Na, K, NH4, \u00bd Ca or \u00bd Mg (in aqueous solution) \n[55,57,61]\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 34 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nS + O2 ?

M2SO3 + H2O  Equation 2. 14 \n\nIn sulfite process, temperature control and uniform distribution of liquor play major \n\nroles. Heat is only supplied partially at the beginning, until uniform impregnation of wood \n\nchips is achieved. For a uniform impregnation of wood, long times are required. Sulfurous \n\nacid tends to penetrated wood chips rather rapidly, relatively to the base, leading to a high \n\nconcentration of acid on the wood chips. So long times are required to allow bases to \n\nbuffer the system and avoid wood chips to char. Afterwards temperature is further raised, \n\nuntil reaching a chosen value. At the end the pressure on the digester is reduced \n\n(decompression), which causes wood fibres to separate. Process conditions may vary \n\naccording with wood species, ion base, temperature, pulping time (8-14h), amount of acid \n\nand ratio liquor to wood.\n[55,57,61]\n\n \n\nOverall, sulfite pulping exhibits yields between 40-52%, and produces medium \n\nstrength pulp, with soft, flexible fibres. Lignin content is low, so pulps are easily bleached, \n\nbeing required less chemicals when compared with kraft process. \n[55,57,61]\n\n \n\nThere are four basic sulfite pulping processes currently in commercial use, these \n\ninclude acid sulfite, bisulfite, neutral sulfite, and alkaline sulfite processes. Being the main \n\ndifferences between one another the levels of acidity and alkalinity used to break down \n\nwood and remove lignin (Table 2. 3). \n[55,57,61]\n\n \n\nTable 2. 3 - Sulfite pulping processes conditions (adapted from \n[61]\n\n). \n\n Initial pH range at 25\u00baC Base alternatives Active species \n\nAcid sulfite 1-2 Ca\n2+\n\n, Mg\n2+\n\n, Na\n+\n, NH4\n\n+\n H\n\n+\n, HSO3\n\n? \n\nBisulfite 3-5 Mg\n2+\n\n, Na\n+\n, NH4\n\n+\n H\n\n+\n, HSO3\n\n? \n\nNeutral Sulfite 6-9 Na\n+\n, NH4\n\n+\n HSO3\n\n?, SO3\n2? \n\nAlkaline Sulfite 10-13.5 Na\n+\n SO3\n\n2? , OH- \n\nIn sulfite processes it is also possible to perform chemical recovery of reactants. \n\nOverall, the process consists initially in the washing of the pulp liquor, then on its \n\nconcentration, burning (heat generation during combustions), chemicals regeneration and \n\nby-products recovery. However, burning liquor to recover chemicals does not apply \n\nentirely to all chemicals. An example is ammonia that is converted into H2O and N2 \n\nthrough the burning process. \n[55,57,61]\n\n \n\nHowever, bases such as, Mg\n2+\n\n and Na\n+\n are possible to recover. For example, \n\nmagnesium is possible to be recovered from burning of the cooking liquor, by recovery of \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 35 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\ngases as MgO. This last is posteriorly slurried in water to render Mg (OH)2 and then used \n\nto trap SO2 and generate Mg (HSO3)2.\n[57,61]\n\n  \n\nSulfite process, oppositely to kraft are unable to cook softwoods such as pine. \n\nHowever, the produced pulps have high alpha-cellulose content (\u201cpure\u201d cellulose content \n\nextracted from fibres, stable, with high polymerization degree), which are used to produce, \n\nfor example, rayon. \n[57,61]\n\n \n\n2.2.1.3. Semi-chemical pulps \n\nIn addition to the methods previously described, it is also possible to conjugate both \n\nchemical and mechanical treatments to produce cellulosic pulp, semi-chemical pulp. In this \n\ncase the wood chips are initially treated with a mild chemical treatment and then subjected \n\nto mechanical treatment (refining) to separate fibres from one another. In this process \n\nlignin and hemicelluloses are partially removed, rendering pulps with yield of 60-80%. The \n\ninitial chemical treatment principles may be alike to those of chemical pulping (previously \n\ndiscussed), differing in process conditions such as cooking time, chemicals charge, etc. \n\n[55,57]\n \n\nNeutral sulfite semi-chemical, NSSC, is an example of a common semi-chemical \n\npulping method (yields of 75-85%). Here an initial chemical treatment is applied to wood, \n\noften including Na2SO3 and Na2CO3, with a slightly alkaline medium (pH 7-10). Cooking \n\ntimes are short, 0.5-2 h at 160-185\u00b0C .\n[55,57]\n\n \n\nDue to the amount of residual lignin in fibres, these exhibit a certain stiffness. \n\nMoreover, the cooking liquor deficiency in lignin, hinders the chemicals recovery process. \n\nOwing to that, in most cases, semi-chemical mills are integrated with chemical mills to \n\nallow the recovery of chemicals (from their cooking liquors), which may be used as make \n\nup chemicals on the chemical pulp mill. \n[55,57]\n\n \n\nAlthough bleachable semi-chemical pulps require large amounts of bleaching \n\nchemicals. NSSC pulp is used mostly for the production of corrugating medium.\n[55,57]\n\n Most \n\npulping methods discussed on section 2.1.1., used for the production of pulps from wood \n\nare summarized in Table 2. 4.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 36 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nTable 2. 4- Typical pulping processes used in the production of virgin pulps (adapted from \n[57]\n\n). \n\nProcess Chemicals Species Pulp Properties Uses Yield % \n\nMechanical \n\npulping \n\nNone; grind stones for \n\nlogs; disk refiners for \n\nchips \nHardwoods \n\nand some \n\nsoftwoods \n\nHigh opacity, \n\nsoftness, bulk, low \n\nstrength and \n\nbrightness. \nNewsprint, Books, \n\nmagazines \n\n92-96% \n\nChemi-\n\nmechanical \n\npulping \n\nCTMP; mild action; \n\nNaOH or NaHSO3 \nModerate strength 88-95% \n\nKraft process, \n\npH 13-14 \n\nNaOH + Na2S; unlined \n\ndigester, high recovery \n\nof pulping chemicals, \n\nsulfur odor \n\nAll woods \n\nHigh strength, \n\nbrown pulps unless \n\nbleached \n\nBags, wrapping, \n\nlinerboard, \n\nbleached pulps for \n\nwhite papers \n\n65-70% for \n\nbrown papers; \n\n47-50% for \n\nbleachable \n\npulp \n\n43-45% after \n\nbleaching \n\nSulfite, acid or \n\nbisulfite \n\nH2SO3+HSO3\n-\n with \n\nCa\n2+\n\n, Mg\n2+\n\n, Na\n+\n or \n\nNH\n4+\n\n base; Ca\n2+\n\n is \n\ntraditional but outdated \n\nsince no recovery \n\nprocess; lined digesters \n\nHardwoods \n\nLight brown pulp, if \n\nbleached, easily \n\nbleached to high \n\nbrightness, weaker \n\nthan kraft pulp, but \n\nhigher yield \n\nFine paper, tissue, \n\nglassine, strength \n\nreinforcement in \n\nnewsprint \n\n48-51% for \n\nbleachable \n\npulp; 46-48% \n\nafter \n\nbleaching \n\nMg\n2+\n\n base \nAlmost all \n\nspecies \n\nSame as above but \n\nlighter colour and \n\nslightly stronger \n\nNewsprint, fine \n\npapers, etc. \n\n50-51% for \n\nbleachable \n\npulp; \n\n48-50% after \n\nbleaching; \n\nNeutral sulfite \n\nsemi-chemical \n\n(NSSC) pH 7-\n\n10 \n\nNa2SO3 + Na2CO3 about \n\n50% of the chemical \n\nrecovered as Na2SO4 \n\nHardwoods \n\n(preferred) \n\nGood stiffness and \n\nmoldability \n\nCorrugating \n\nmedium \n70-80% \n\n2.2.1.4. Pulp Bleaching \n\nThe cellulosic pulps produced by the pulping processes usually exhibits a dark color, \n\nnamely, a brown tonality. Although this feature does not represent an issue for certain \n\napplications, in other cases it represents a rather significant matter. The colour displayed \n\nby pulp is mostly attributed to the presence of chromophore substances and residual lignin \n\n(compounds able to absorb light and, thus, confer colour). Therefore, to improve pulp \n\nbrightness, pulp is treated with chemical agents able to degrade and/or remove selectively \n\nchromophore structures, while preserving its polysaccharides. However, bleaching also \n\nremoves hemicellulose and extractives.\n[55,63\u201365]\n\n \n\nBleaching processes may occur in two ways, either with the removal of lignin \n\n(delignification), or by preservation of lignin and degradation of some chromophore \n\nstructures. This last is mostly applied to high yield pulps (mechanical pulps), while the \n\nother is applied to chemical pulps. \n[55,63\u201366]\n\n \n\nVarious chemicals may be used to improve pulps brightness. In pulp mills, bleaching \n\ninvolves a set of stages which include bleaching and alkaline extraction. Chemicals used \n\non bleaching include chlorine (C), chlorine dioxide (D), sodium hypochlorite (H), oxygen \n\n(O), hydrogen peroxide (P), ozone (Z), and more recently enzymes (X). Sodium hydroxide \n\nusually functions as extraction reagent (E). \n[55,63,65,66]\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 37 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nHowever, due to environmental issues (production of organochloride compounds), it \n\nbecame necessary to abandon certain chemical reagents. Conventional bleaching methods \n\nbased on chlorine and sodium hypochlorite were replaced by ClO2 or even by other \n\ntechnologies based on oxygen (O), hydrogen peroxide (P), ozone(Z) and more recently \n\nenzymes (X), rendering elemental chlorine-free (ECF) and totally chlorine free (TCF) \n\nbleaching processes. \n[55,63,65,66]\n\n \n\nFrom all the referred agents, the use of enzymes is the newest one. In an enzymatic \n\nstage different enzymes may be used. An example would be the employment of xylanase. \n\nIts hydrolytic action towards its surrounding hemicelluloses (namely xylans) turns lignin \n\nvulnerable to oxidation by hydrolysis.\n[55,67]\n\n The progress in bleaching is followed by \n\nmeasuring brightness, more specifically the reflectance of visible blue light at 457 nm (ISO \n\nstandard norm)\n[66]\n\n \n\n2.2.2. Recycled pulp \n\nBesides virgin pulp, recycled fibres are also an important source of cellulosic pulp. \n\nOn nowadays paper industry their presence has grown as replacements of virgin pulps. An \n\nexample of this would be the increase of paper recycling in Europe in 2011 of 70.4%. This \n\ngrowth, overall may be attributed to various facts such as its cost (virgin fibres became \n\nexpensive due to its limited availability), along with environmental and ecological \n\nconcerns. Besides, the constant evolution on the deinking technology has enabled paper \n\nrecycling processes to became, with time, more efficient and eco-friendly, relatively to \n\nthose used to produce virgin fibres. \n[68,69]\n\n  \n\nAs stated before, paper industry is increasing its use of recycled fibres (Figure 2. 16). \n\nThey are majorly applied on packing products, newsprint and hygiene paper \n\nproduction.\n[70,71]\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. 16 \u2013 European Paper Recycling between 1991 and 2015.\n[72]\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 38 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\n2.2.2.1. Deinking \n\nThe process of paper recycling passes through deinking. The deinking process \n\nconsists on a sequence of different treatments, with the main purpose of removing ink and \n\nother impurities from fibres. \n[70,73]\n\n \n\ni) Paper waste assembly \n\nIt begins with the assembly of paper waste, the raw material used to produce recycled \n\nfibres. This process also includes a sorting stage, where paper wastes are sorted into \n\ndifferent categories, made into bales, and transported into the paper mill, where paper \n\nwaste will be converted into recycled pulp. The sources of paper waste consist mostly on \n\nOld newsprint (ONP), Old magazines (OMG), mixed office waste (MOW) and other \n\nhigher grade papers along with old corrugated containers (OCC). The combination of all \n\nthese operations makes it a rather expensive process. Moreover, the variability of the \n\nfeedstock meant for recycling, may afflict variations on the deinking process.\n[68,70,73]\n\n  \n\nThe bales of waste paper received on the paper mill are then subjected to series of \n\nprocess treatments.\n[70,73,74]\n\n Emphasis will be given to key deinking operations, namely \n\npulping, floatation and washing. Even though bleaching is an optional stage aiming to \n\nimprove recycled paper brightness, this operation will also be discussed. \n\nii) Pulping and screening \n\nWhen received, papers wastes are fed to a pulper for disintegration into fibres. \n\nDuring repulping (slushing), waste paper is soaked, disintegrated, and ink and other \n\nimpurities start to detach from fibres. If the paper waste (fibres source) exhibits rather high \n\nwet strength, a disperser may be used to aid fibre separation. Chemicals, temperature or \n\nboth aid the process. Chemicals, such as sodium hydroxide, sodium silicates and EDTA \n\nmay be used to improve fibre wetting, disintegration and impurities detachment.\n[70,73,74]\n\n \n\nOther contaminates such as plastic materials, metals and other types of impurities \n\nmay also be removed on refuse removal, high-density cleaning and/or screening \n\nstages.\n[70,73,74]\n\n \n\nScreening is used to remove and minimize the aforementioned impurities as early as \n\npossible. In this process the impurity particles are retained by a screen and thus separated \n\nfrom the fibres. For an optimized process screens not only contain rotors and screen hole \n\nbaskets, but also a cyclone function to separate heavy from light portions.\n[70,73,74]\n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 39 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\niii) Floatation and Washing \n\nThe main operations used in deinking consist on flotation and washing, whose main \n\nobjectives are the removal of ink along with other impurities.  \n\nIn the case of floatation, the hydrophobic particles made of impurities (whose major \n\ncomponent are inks), coalesce into larger particles, aided by chemicals and air bubbles, \n\ntowards the surface. Then, the formed froth is removed. This process may be influenced by \n\nvariables such as water hardness, pH, consistency, particle size and temperatures (usually \n\n40-45\u00baC). To aid the process, chemicals such as calcium soaps are often used. These \n\nchemicals are named collectors, since their job consists, mostly, on promoting impurities \n\nagglomeration, by enhancing the chemical interaction between its particles and air bubbles. \n\nOther chemicals, often used on this process consist on sodium hydroxide, (pH increase, \n\nfibre swelling, emulsification), fatty acid soaps (collectors), and surfactants (improve ink \n\ndetachment). \n[70,73\u201375]\n\n \n\nRelatively to the washing process, the principles behind it are related with the \n\ndifference in size between fibres and dirt particles. In terms of chemicals it does not differ \n\nmuch from flotation, being the main difference the use of higher amounts of surfactants \n\ninstead of fatty acids. However, since washing removes a rather high amount of fillers, this \n\nprocess becomes rather relevant for the production of low ash pulp, which is often used for \n\ntissue paper production and other applications requiring such features.\n[70,73]\n\n \n\nThe combination of floatation and washing is often observed in some mills. The \n\nconjugation of the different deinking processes depends strongly on the fibre source \n\ncomposition and on the end-pulp desired features. Deinking processes based on floatation \n\nrender higher yields and higher selectivity, comparatively to washing based deinking. The \n\nselectivity in both may be improved by applying one or more specialty chemicals. \n[73\u201375]\n\n \n\nIn general, washing displays high efficiency removing small particles (<10 ?m), \n\nwhereas floatation exhibits better results removing medium-sized particles (10\u2013100 ?m). \n\nAs concerns larger impurities particles ( >100 ?m), screening and centrifugal cleaners are \n\nused.\n[73]\n\n These processes may occur either on alkaline or neutral environment. Alkaline \n\ndeinking medium is widely used and considered more efficient for ink removal than \n\nneutral. However, it generates significant chemical oxygen demand, which is caused by the \n\nremoval of carbohydrates and organic impurities from fibres.\n[70,73]\n\n \n\niv) Bleaching \n\nBleaching may be included on the deinking operations and it can be performed \n\ndepending on the requirements desired on the end-product. It is a way to improve pulps \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 40 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\noptical properties and add value.\n[70,74]\n\n Similarly to other operations, previously mentioned, \n\nbleaching conditions also strongly depend on the used fibre source (feedstock variability). \n\nIn this process hydrogen peroxide is often applied as bleaching agent, due to its easy \n\nemployment and low price. Additionally, since it does not degrade and remove lignin, it \n\ndoesn\u2019t affect negatively neither the pulp yield (decrease) or the mill effluents (increase \n\nchemical oxygen demand COD, etc).\n[70,73]\n\n \n\nA wide variety of chemicals may be used for bleaching. Besides chlorine free \n\nbleaching chemicals, such as, hydrogen peroxide (previously mentioned) or sodium \n\ndithionite, chlorine-containing chemicals (chlorine dioxide and sodium hypochlorite) have \n\nbeen used for wood free fibres, although these last have been abandoned due to \n\nenvironmental issues (formation of organochlorine compounds).\n[70,75\u201377]\n\n \n\nIn most cases the bleaching involves a two-stage process, consisting on an oxidation \n\nstage followed by a reduction. Even though in some cases these stages are sequential, \n\noverall something is added to end the oxidative action before the reductive stage starts. \n\nExamples of oxidative agents include hydrogen peroxide or oxygen, while the reductive \n\nones are often sodium hydrosulfite and formamidine sulfinic acid (FAS). These are often \n\nused for bleaching and discoloration, and its use is rather relevant on fibre sources heavily \n\ncontaminated with dyes and inks. \n[70,73,76,77]\n\n \n\nThe deinking operation lines comprise the combination of the techniques \n\naforementioned and others, such as, screening (remove impurities), thickening (presses or \n\nbelts used to increase pulp consistency), dispersion (detachment of contaminants and \n\nreduction of its particles to smaller sizes), or fine cleaning. \n[70,73,74]\n\n \n\nAfter the deinking process, the pulp is ready to be manufactured into paper and \n\nrelated products. Some paper and board grades may be produced over recycled fibres \n\nexclusively. This can include corrugating medium and test liner, or newsprint. Other \n\ngrades use blends of recycled and virgin fibres.\n[73]\n\n \n\nAs regards recycled pulp optical features, these are of utter importance in all cases, \n\nwith exception of dark coloured board. In other cases, such as fine papers, newsprint or \n\ntissue paper production, high demands are required not only in terms of brightness but also \n\nin terms of low impurities specks count.\n[70,73]\n\n \n\nAnother parameter with high significance is the ash content. Depending on the pulps \n\nend-purpose, this parameter may be carefully controlled during deinking. An example of \n\nthis would be the recycled pulp used for tissue paper manufacture. In this case, low ash \n\ncontent is required, not only due to process sensibility to high ash content, but also due to \n\nissues with end product desired features.\n[70,73]\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 41 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nThe presence of stickies (such as glues, adhesives, etc) are another parameter to \n\nconsider, since their presence is often associated with recycled paper quality.\n[70]\n\n \n\nBesides the aforementioned, a good printability is also an important parameter as \n\nregards certain paper grades. Here, properties such as the fibre aptitude towards paper \n\nformation, fibres surface properties and papers strength are relevant. Additionally, \n\nproperties such as water absorption and wet and dry strength are also rather essential, that \n\nis the case of tissue paper products.\n[70]\n\n \n\n2.2.2.2. Recycled fibres quality \n\nThe expansion of recycled fibres utilization has driven a demand for a better \n\ncomprehension about its nature and fundamental differences departing them from virgin \n\nfibres. As mentioned before, recycled fibres source is waste paper, whose features \n\ninfluence recycled fibres quality. Consequently, the different stages of waste fibres history, \n\nsuch as its origin or the processes they were subjected to, through its lifecycle, condition \n\nthe produced recycled fibres properties. \n[78]\n\n \n\nCellulosic fibres can change significantly when formed in the wet web of paper and, \n\nsubsequently, subjected to processes such as pressing, drying, printing, storage, repulping, \n\nand deinking. Often it is possible to replace recycled fibres by virgin ones, although their \n\nbehaviour displays differences in terms of properties, such as lower hydration abilities, \n\nlower strength properties, etc. \n[69]\n\n \n\nThe presence of impurities is able to affect greatly recycled fibres properties. Even \n\nafter deinking recycled fibres still exhibit significant amounts of impurities such as inks, \n\nglues, filler, fatty acids, etc. These affect fibres properties, such as its ability to bind and its \n\nhydrophilicity. However, the losses of intrinsic fibres properties (bonding ability, \n\nflexibility and swelling) are mostly attributed to the hornification effect. This phenomena \n\nlimits significantly the application of recycled pulps in papermaking, especially in papers \n\nthat require good strength properties.\n[79\u201381]\n\n \n\n2.2.2.2.1. Hornification \n\nCellulosic fibres hornification consists in a series of structural changes on cellulosic \n\nfibres, induced, mainly, by successive swelling, pressing, and mostly drying operations. By \n\nsubjecting fibres to such stressful conditions, rearrangements on cellulose chains occur, \n\nleading to the formation of irreversible hydrogen bonds between fibrils, yielding fibril \n\naggregation, fibre collapse, substantial losses on fibres porosity, stiffening, inability to \n\nswell as originally, loss on fibre bonding capacity and, therefore, losses on mechanical and \n\nhydration properties. \n[79,82\u201384]\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 42 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nHornification has been widely studied through the years and its consequences are of \n\nutter importance to pulp and paper industry, since drying and swelling are essential parts of \n\nthe papermaking process, and the main guilty parties behind it. Besides, the on growing \n\nuse of recycled fibres has made more and more essential a better comprehension of all the \n\nphenomena associated with losses on fibres quality, during its lifecycle.\n[85]\n\n  \n\nIn general, the irreversibility of the hornification effect is related with the formation \n\nof irreversible hydrogen bonds. Cellulose displays a high amount of free OH groups, which \n\nallows the formation of interfibrillar bonds through hydrogen interactions. (Figure 2. \n\n17).\n[82,85]\n\n  \n\n \n\nFigure 2. 17 \u2013 Hydrogen bonds between cellulose fibrils. \n\nAs results of the hydrogen bonding between external cellulose chains in fibrils, their \n\naggregation takes place. Interactions between cellulose and water also play a relevant role, \n\nas concerns the supramolecular structure. Although not as strong as covalent bonds, due to \n\nhigh surface area and small distance between OH groups, hydrogen bonds, between \n\ncellulose chains, contribute significantly to the polymer supramolecular structure, which \n\nconfer cellulosic fibres the ability to swell without dissolving in water.\n[85]\n\n  \n\nTo explain the effect of drying (major cause of hornification) Scallan\n[84,86]\n\n proposed \n\na model. In this model, an interpretation can be taken to what happens to microfibrils and \n\nits fibrils upon swelling, drying and re-swelling. The structure of dry cellulose consists on \n\na set of microfibrils held together by hydrogen bonds, as shown in Figure 2. 18 (A). When \n\nin contact with water, water molecules interrupt interfibrilar hydrogen bonds, inducing \n\nfibrils to break apart initially into B, and further C and possibly D (Figure 2. 18). Upon \n\ndrying fibrils return to structure A (Figure 2. 18). Although, upon re-swelling, due to \n\nhornification (presence of irreversible hydrogen bonds between adjacent microfibrils \n\npossibly formed during the drying process), fibrillar aggregation is verified, and therefore \n\nthe microfibril structure expands less upon re-wetting, due to a lacking of free OH groups \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 43 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\navailable for interaction. Therefore, the microfibril structure instead of expanding further, \n\nas in C or D will be closer to B (Figure 2. 18).\n[84\u201386]\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. 18 \u2013 Scallan model(1977) (adapted from \n[85]\n\n). \n\nThe decrease of free OH groups caused by the hornification phenomena, has been \n\ninvestigated in the past \n[32\u201334]\n\n. It was demonstrated that the decrease of free OH groups, \n\nupon drying (cause of hornification), always leads to the decrease of accessibility.\n[85]\n\n As \n\npreviously mentioned, hornification may be promoted/stimulated during certain process \n\noperations, such as pressing, drying, calendaring, printing, deinking, etc). During this \n\noperations, favourable conditions are gathered prompting the occurrence of \n\nhornification.\n[79,87]\n\n \n\nFactors affecting hornification \n\ni) Drying process \n\nIn pulp production and paper making the process of water removal from cellulosic \n\nfibres includes operations such as wet pressing, air drying or oven drying. High \n\ntemperatures allow a rapid evaporation and thus removal of water molecules from fibres, \n\nwhich promotes structural rearrangements (different predisposition of fibrils) and the \n\nformation of irreversible hydrogen bonds, typical of hornification. The aggregation of \n\nfibrils and lower accessibility to free OH groups constitutes hornified fibres. Therefore, it \n\nis of general agreement that fibres hornification is highly affected by drying. Regardless of \n\nhigh temperatures effect, the water removal also contributes largely to fibres \n\nhornification.\n[82,85]\n\n \n\nii) Water amount in pulps \n\nWater loss during drying also affects fibres hornification. When fibres are in contact \n\nwith water structural changes are verified, and since water molecules disrupt bonds \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 44 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nbetween cellulose molecules, its mobility becomes less difficult, since there are less bonds \n\nholding them together. Small amounts of water (ca. 10-20 %w/w) allows to maintain the \n\nfibrils relatively disaggregated.The deep dehydration of pulp (less than 5%w/w residual \n\nwater), leads to strong intermolecular interaction and fibrils aggregation. These changes \n\nare irreversible, because upon drying and re-wetting, pulps properties (hydration abilities \n\nand strength properties) differ from those from the beginning. Therefore, the formation of \n\nirreversible hydrogen bonds is promoted by exhaustive removal of water, bringing the \n\naforementioned changes on fibres properties.\n[82,85]\n\n  \n\niii) Fibres chemistry \n\nFibres composition plays an essential role on inter- and intra-fibre bondings which \n\ndetermine papers strength properties. Chemical (low yield) and mechanical (high yield) \n\npulps differ from one another in terms of its fibres chemistry. While in the first most lignin \n\nwas removed accompanied by some hemicelluloses (chemical process), in the latter most \n\nof its lignin matrix and hemicelluloses are kept (high yield).  \n\nIn high yield pulps, the presence of high lignin and hemicelluloses contents benefits \n\nfibres, since these compounds act as barrier and protect cellulose-cellulose hydrogen \n\nbonds. By preventing the formation of irreversible hydrogen bonds, these compounds \n\nprotect fibres from the hornification effect, being thus less prone to it.\n[79,81,84,85]\n\n \n\nOn the other hand, chemical pulps exhibit a high exposure of its OH groups (higher \n\naccessibility to free OH groups), due to the removal of lignin along with some \n\nhemicelluloses. This turns chemical pulps prone towards rearrangements, to the formation \n\nof irreversible hydrogen bonds and aggregation. Being susceptible to hornification, these \n\npulps suffer losses on its fibres properties as result of hornification (e.g. hydration \n\nproperties and strength properties). \n[79,81,84,85]\n\n \n\n2.2.2.3. Treatments to improve recycled fibres \n\nRecycled fibres suffer severe losses on their properties during their lifecycle, being \n\nonly able to be recycled at most 3-5 times. However, these losses can be attenuated by a \n\nwide range of treatments. These treatments include mechanical (refining), chemical (such \n\nas alkaline solutions) and even biological treatments (enzymes). Alternative hypotheses \n\ninclude the mixture of virgin fibres with recycled fibres, or recycled fibres fractionation. \n\nNevertheless, refining and alkaline treatment are the most common methods applied to \n\nimprove recycled fibres properties. \n[78,79,81,87]\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 45 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\ni) Refining \n\nFibre properties may be changed through a mechanical treatment widely used on \n\npapermaking, refining. Its main purpose is to further defibrillate fibres, which were \n\ncollapsed with aggregated fibrils, and, thus, with less bonding potential due to \n\nhornification. The defibrillation produced by refining is expected to improve fibres \n\naccessibility, fibre bonding potential and thus its hydration and strength properties, which \n\nwere compromised due to hornification. \n[78,79,81,87]\n\n  \n\nAlthough refining poses a good alternative to regain recycled fibres properties, it also \n\ncauses fibres shorting, further fines creation and therefore lower freeness. Therefore, when \n\nrefining recycled fibres it is important to bear in mind that during its history, recovered \n\nfibres have already suffered refining and that recycled pulp has fibres that may be more \n\nprone to fragmentation. Thus, refining parameters should be carefully controlled, in order \n\nto decrease, as much as possible, the negative effects coming from its use. To attenuate \n\nsuch effects, low intensity refining or high consistency refining may be used.\n[79,81,87,88]\n\n \n\nii) Blending  \n\nRecycled fibres properties can also be upgraded by blending with other fibres, such \n\nas virgin fibres. Due to recycled fibres low bonding ability, stiffness and thus frailer \n\nmechanical properties, virgin fibres, in a certain proportion, are blended with recycled \n\nfibres. Virgin fibres do not exhibit low bonding ability like hornified fibres, thus they \n\nconfer to the blend higher bonding ability, yielding stronger fibres network and thus \n\nstrength properties. This is especially true when it comes to blending with refined virgin \n\nfibres. \n[78,79,87]\n\n \n\niii) Fractionation \n\nThe technique of fractionation mostly applied during the paper recycling process, is \n\nused as a way to upgrade recycled fibres performance. It does not reverse the effect of \n\nhornification on recycled fibres properties, but, since it separates different types of fibres in \n\nthe recycling process, it attenuates the losses in terms of its papermaking properties. \n\n[78,79,81,87]\n \n\nFractionation improves pulp quality and allows a better control of pulp and paper \n\ncharacteristics by redistributing its fines and ash. Usually it is easy to find utility for the \n\nlong fibre fraction, although the same is not exact when it comes to the short fibres fraction \n\nand stickies.\n[78,79,81]\n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 46 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\niv) Chemical treatments \n\nDifferent approaches may be followed; i.e. chemical treatments may be applied \n\neither with the intension of preventing hornification or to improve fibres properties \n\ndegraded by hornification. \n[79,81,87]\n\n \n\nAn example of prevention treatments includes the chemical modification of \n\ncellulosic fibres, before papermaking, by partial substitution of cellulose OH groups. These \n\nmethods aim to avert the formation of the irreversible hydrogen bonds, characteristic from \n\nhornification. These methods consist, in most cases, on cellulose derivatization which \n\nincludes methylation, acetylation or even carboxymethylation reactions. \n[79,87]\n\n \n\nChemical additives may also be added as a way, not to prevent, but to \n\nimprove/reverse hornification. Alkaline solutions are a rather popular treatment in \n\npapermaking to improve recycled fibres properties. After refining is the second most \n\nreliable method to retrieve recycled fibres properties. The treatment of recovered fibres \n\nwith sodium hydroxide (high pH conditions) aims, mostly, to improve fibres swelling, \n\nfreeness and its strength properties. It has demonstrated better results, in some cases, than \n\neven refining, however, in the next recycling cycle fibres will be more affected by \n\nhornification. Alkaline treatment may be conjugated with refining to further improve \n\nrecycled fibres properties.\n[79,81,88]\n\n \n\nv) Enzymatic treatment \n\nIn the last decades, the use of enzymes on paper recycling processes has \n\ndemonstrated great potential as an environmentally friendly addition for the deinking \n\nprocess. The use of enzymes during paper recycling aids not only impurities removal and \n\nbleaching, but also improving recycled fibres drainability and strength properties. \n[81,89,90]\n\n \n\n Enzymes action during deinking generally occurs either by attacking the \n\nink/impurities or the fibre surface on the fibre-ink interface. Enzymes can be used \n\nseparately or in conjunction, to optimize the deinking process. Pectinases, hemicellulases, \n\ncellulases and other ligninolytic enzymes act on the fibre surface or bonds close to the ink \n\nparticles, freeing the ink for removal. Lipases and esterases act by degrading inks based on \n\nvegetable oils. \n\nLigninolytic enzymes action, besides removing impurities, also may improves fibres \n\nstrength properties (higher bonding ability) and drainability.\n[81,89\u201391]\n\n \n\n Cellulases are widely used to facilitate the deinking of waste paper. Its action peels \n\nfibres, which, besides aiding impurities removal, also improves fibres bonding ability \n\n(fibre are more fibrillated) and its freeness (fines degradation). Cellulases may also be used \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 47 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nin conjunction with hemicellulases. Hemicellulases may also be used alone without \n\ncellulases. An example of a widely used enzyme on pulps biobleaching is xylanase. \n\nAdditionally, this enzyme, due to its ligninolytic nature, may modify fibres to be with \n\nproperties near those of slightly beaten. \n[90\u201393]\n\n \n\nEnzymes represent thus a great opportunity to improve recycled fibres quality and \n\nturn more efficient the paper recycling process. By applying the appropriate enzyme \n\ncocktail, under optimum conditions, it is possible to improve deinking, drainability, \n\nstickies control and \u201crefine\u201d pulp (energy savings). \n[81,90,94]\n\n \n\n2.3. Paper products - Tissue papers \n\nPulp is used as main source to produce a great variety of products with numerous \n\napplications. Examples of products manufactured from pulp include office paper, \n\nnewspapers, magazines, books, packing products, tissue paper, etc.\n[54]\n\n Despite the huge \n\nvariety of pulp end uses this work will only be focused on tissue paper manufacture.  \n\nTissue paper consists on a low weight creped paper, widely used by society for \n\ndomestic, sanitary and industrial purposes. Tissue is often made in weight ranging from 8-\n\n50g/m\n2 \n\nwith a porous elastic structure, with a good absorption ability and high softness. It \n\ncan be made from both virgin and recycled fibres, as mentioned on the previous sections, \n\nand used to produce a wide diversity of products such as toilet paper, facial tissue paper, \n\npaper towels, napkins, etc.\n[95,96]\n\n \n\n2.3.1. Tissue paper production \n\nTissue paper is usually produced by a mixture of hardwood and softwood pulps; \n\nwhose proportion depends from paper mill to paper mill. Recycled pulp is normally used to \n\nproduce recycled based tissue products, but essentially in conjugation with virgin fibres. \n\n[95,96]\n \n\nGeneral paper production process consists of the following stages. Initially, stock is \n\nprepared by dispersing pulp in water and additives. Pulp suspension is then supplied on a \n\nformer section, where water is removed by gravity or vacuum. Afterwards the wet paper \n\nweb enters the press section where further water is removed mechanically (dry solid \n\ncontent of 33-55% depending on the type of paper). The remaining water is removed by \n\ndrying, on a drying section, which could be done by one or more stages depending on the \n\npaper grade.\n[97]\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 48 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nEven though the principles behind paper machines are much alike they still exhibit \n\ndifferences in terms of individual components, which is related with the type of paper \n\nproduced.\n[96\u201398]\n\n \n\nIn tissue paper production the sheet formation process in many cases still consists on \n\na fourdrinier wet-end, which entails many operations such as stock delivery, sheet \n\nformation, water removal, low vacuum and high vacuum. Other technologies include gap \n\nformers or crescent formers. For example, in a conventional tissue machine the paper web \n\nis formed in a gap former, transferred by the felt to the dryer section, where first is pressed \n\nand mechanically dewatered by a shoe press acting against the tissue cylinder.\n[98,99]\n\n \n\nIn the drying section, two types of processes may be encountered. In conventional \n\nwet press process (CWP), the dryer section includes a Yankee dryer section, which is the \n\nmost traditional drying technology. Although in recent years the through air drying, TAD, \n\ntechnology arose as an alternative. \n[96,98,100]\n\n \n\nIn the typical CWP process the paper web is formed, then transferred to a felt and \n\ndewatered by pressing against the Yankee dryer. The pressing allows the paper web to be \n\ntransferred into the Yankee dryer surface, where an adhesive was sprayed prior to the sheet \n\nformation to provide good adhesion between the paper sheet and the Yankee dryer surface. \n\nThe Yankee dryer consists on an iron cylinder (Yankee cylinder) with a diameter of 5-7m, \n\nheated with steam from the inside, to dry the paper web passing at high speeds outside. The \n\npaper web is dried and is then removed by a steel blade, \u201cthe blade doctor\u201d, which \n\nproduces a creped elastic sheet. The creping process is controlled by the strength of the \n\nadhesive on the Yankee cylinder, the geometry of creping blade, the speed difference \n\nbetween the Yankee and the final section of the paper machine and pulp features. \n[95,96,100]\n\n \n\nThe creping process decreases sheet density, increases strength, and thus softness \n\nalong with good absorbency features, which are typical on tissue paper products. After \n\ncreping, the paper sheet obtained is subsequently made into tissue products. \n[100]\n\n \n\nThe TAD process consists on another drying process, which is used to produce extra \n\nsoft and absorbent tissue paper. In this process the paper web is dewatered and pre-dried, \n\nwithout mechanical pressing, which preserves bulk. Hence, the paper web is formed and \n\nthen transferred to the porous TAD-cylinder, in this case, into the TAD-wire, where the \n\npaper web is dried by blowing hot air through the paper sheet and the felt. This creates on \n\nthe paper sheet high and low weight regions and high and low density regions, dispersed \n\nthrough the fibres network. After a pre-drying TAD process the paper sheets may be \n\nsubjected to a Yankee dryer and creping, for higher strength, softness and absorbency. \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 49 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nEven though tissue made from TAD is uncreped it is useful in some applications, creping \n\nis mostly commonly used for towel and tissue grades, particularly premium grades. \n[98,100]\n\n \n\nEven though TAD has become rather popular due to its higher absorbency, softness \n\nand bulk papers, the process requires the consumption of tremendous amounts of energy \n\n(twice the energy of conventional drying process). In Figure 2. 19 it is possible to observe \n\nthe illustration of a conventional tissue paper machine, while on Figure 2. 20 it is \n\nrepresented a tissue paper machine with TAD process.\n[95,96]\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. 19 - Conventional tissue paper machine.\n[98]\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. 20 - Tissue paper machine with TAD process for the production of extra soft tissue paper.\n[98]\n\n \n\n2.4. Additives \u2013 Product differentiation \n\nIn tissue paper products aesthetic, tactile and absorbency properties are given major \n\nrelevance by consumers. Products appearance is rather relevant, however its tactile \n\nperception, i.e. softness, and water absorption capacity are yet fundamental features to the \n\nconsumer\u2019s eyes. These properties may be adjusted by process variables, or improved \n\nfurther by the addition of additives. \n[100,101]\n\n \n\nAdditives may be applied to either improve already existing paper properties, such as \n\nits hydrophilicity or softness, or to confer new differentiating features. This is the case of \n\nadditives able to confer features such as colour, odour or even antimicrobial properties. \n\nThese new features, besides allowing tissue paper to differentiate from conventional tissue \n\npaper products, turns them more appealing and special towards consumers. Examples of \n\nadditives applied to achieve the aforementioned properties include humectants (improve \n\nhydrophilicity and softness), dyes (confer colour), antimicrobial agents (antimicrobial \n\nproperties) or even perfumes (pleasant odour). \n[102,103]\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 50 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\n2.4.1. Humectants \n\nDue to cellulosic fibres high affinity for water, paper is used to manufacture a wide \n\nvariety of absorbent products. As mentioned in previous sections, cellulose is able to \n\ninteract with water and form hydrogen bonds. However, the amount of water that cellulosic \n\nfibres are able to absorbs varies and is influenced by cellulose accessibility (as previously \n\nmentioned) and thus by fibres porosity or even its composition. \n\nIn tissue manufacture to improve papers water absorption capacity, changes on the \n\nprocess may be applied. As early mentioned, TAD drying and creping operations influence \n\ngreatly tissue paper absorbency. For example, creping plays a key role on tissue paper \n\nwater absorption. The process induces crinkles on tissue paper, which breaks many \n\ninterfibre bonds, which were previously formed during drying. This operation changes \n\ntissue paper topography, which results on much higher surface area and thus more sites \n\navailable for interaction with water. Additionally it also turns tissue paper softer.\n[96,98,100]\n\n \n\nBesides mechanical operations, in tissue and other hygienic and cosmetic products, \n\nchemical additives, otherwise denominated as wetting agents, humectants or moisturizers \n\nmay be added to further improve both water retention/absorption and softness properties. \n\n[104,105]\n \n\nIn products such as cosmetics or food packing its composition often includes \n\nhumectants. Humectants attract and hold on to water. Thus these materials are applied, in a \n\nwide variety of products, either to retard water loss or to increase its uptake. This task is \n\nusually performed by substances of hygroscopic nature. Example of humectants often used \n\non cosmetic products include pyrrodilone carboxylic acid, urea, panthenol, butylene glycol, \n\npropylene glycol, glycerine, polyethylene glycol, and other inorganic ions.\n[106\u2013108]\n\n \n\nHumectants can be divided into three groups, inorganic, metal-organic and organic. \n\nBoth metal-organic and organic humectants are frequently applied on the manufacture of \n\nhygiene and cosmetic products, while the same is not valid for inorganic humectants. \n[108]\n\n \n\ni) Inorganic humectants \n\nInorganic humectants consist on salts of inorganic acids. Calcium chloride is an \n\nexample. These type of humectants find little use on personal care products due to \n\nproblems related not only with its corrosive action, but also with problems such as \n\ndestabilization of emulsions in creams, decreasing foam, etc. \n[108]\n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 51 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nii) Metal-Organic Humectants \n\nMetal organic humectants, as denoted by its designation consist on a mixture of a \n\nmetal ions and an organic counterpart. These humectants are rather useful and include \n\ncompounds such as sodium lactate or sodium PCA (pyrrolidone carboxylic acid). \n[106,108]\n\n \n\niii) Organic Humectants \n\nOrganic humectants are extensively used in the cosmetic industry. This class of \n\ncompounds includes glycerol, ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol (PEG), propylene \n\nglycol, glycerine, urea, sorbitol, etc. Their strength as humectants depends strongly on their \n\nratio of OH to carbons, hence increasing ratio increasing hygroscopy. \n[106,108]\n\n \n\nThe changes produced on a material hydrophilicity by the addition of hygroscopic \n\nagents, namely on paper products can be accessed by many tests. In case of tissue paper \n\nthis analysis can be performed considering ISO 12625-8:2010 (Tissue paper and tissue \n\nproducts - Part 8: Water-absorption time and water-absorption capacity, basket-immersion \n\ntest method) and ISO 8787:1986 (Paper and board - Determination of capillary rise - \n\nKlemm method). The first test is extensively used on tissue paper industry and it allowed \n\nto determine the quantity of water a certain amount of paper is able to absorb, along with \n\nthe time of absorption. As regards ISO 8787:1986, its used has been abandoned through \n\nthe years by replacement with ISO 12625-8:2010. \n\nA material hydrophilicity may also be accessed through contact angle analysis. \n\nAlthough not common for tissue paper this analysis is widely used to investigate materials \n\nwettability. \n\n2.4.2. Dyes \n\nColour of objects (e.g. paper) is only possible due to the interaction of light with \n\nmatter. When light is shone upon it, part of that light will be absorbed, while the other will \n\nbe reflected. It is this light, the reflected part that will enter human eye and send a signal, \n\nwhich the brain interprets as colour. Humans are only perceptive towards a small portion \n\nof the electromagnetic spectrum, the visible region, between 400 and 700 nm. \n[109,110]\n\n  \n\nIt is of common understanding, that when light is completely reflected, to our eyes \n\nthe colour appears white, whereas if all is absorbed it appears black. Additionally, when \n\nlight is reflected throughout the whole visible spectre the object appears grey. \n\nNevertheless, if light is partially absorbed, as in a short wavelength range (e.g. 435-480nm, \n\nblue light), then chromatic colour appears (in this case yellow). In Table 2. 5 it is possible \n\nto observe the different regions of the visible spectrum, the colour of light at that specific \n\nwavelength band and the shade which will absorb that particular wavelength. All shades \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 52 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\ncan be represented by a reflectance spectra, which works much like a fingerprint. \n[109,111]\n\n \n\nTable 2. 5 \u2013 Wavelengths of light and the colour it absorbs. \n[109]\n\n \n\nWavelength (nm) Colour of this light Colour which will absorb this wavelength \n\n400-435 Violet Greenish yellow \n\n435-480 Blue Yellow \n\n480-490 Greenish blue Orange \n\n490-500 Bluish green Red \n\n500-560 Green Purple \n\n560-580 Greenish yellow Violet \n\n580-595 Yellow Blue \n\n595-605 Orange Greenish blue \n\n605-700 Red Bluish green \n\nTo convey colour to paper, cellulosic fibres are treated with dyes. The selection of \n\nthe most appropriate dye to impregnate cellulosic fibres depends, mostly, on the end-\n\nproducts purposes, its desired physic-chemical properties, its features or manipulation. \n\nOverall, dyeing is expected to confer paper a specific shade or tonality .\n[110]\n\n  \n\nThere is a wide variety of dyes able to absorb light at different wavelengths and \n\ntherefore bestow different colours to paper products. Dyes can be classified according with \n\nits chemical structure (e.g. azo, anthraquinones, etc) or its application method, the \n\nclassification by colour index (acid, basic, direct dyes, etc). The former classification is \n\ncommonly used by the dye chemists, while the latter is mostly used by the dye users. \n\n[111,112]\n Even though being quite common, both classification may be mixed together to \n\ndesignate a dye (for example, direct azo dye or anthraquinone acid dyes).\n[111,113]\n\n However, \n\nhere it will only be introduced the colour index classification, which is the most common \n\namong its users, such as the paper industry.  \n\n2.4.2.1. Colour Index classification \n\nThe colour index classification, i.e. dye classification according with its use or \n\nmethod of application, may be advantageous on the eye of users, relatively to classification \n\nby chemical structure. In this system of classification, dyes are divided into groups such as \n\nbasic dyes, acid dyes, direct dyes, sulfur dyes, pigments, reactive dyes, vat dyes, disperse \n\ndyes, mordant dyes, etc. Although, in paper industry, the most common are direct dyes \n\n(Figure 2. 21).\n[110,112]\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 53 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\n \n\nFigure 2. 21 \u2013 Relevance of the different classes of dyes in 2004 (adapted from[110]). \n\ni) Basic Dyes (Cationic dyes) \n\nBasic or cationic dyes consist mostly on salts (chlorides, hydrochlorides, sulfates, \n\nand oxalates) of colour bases.\n[109,110,113]\n\n Some of older basic dyes consisted on di- and \n\ntriphenylmethane, heterocyclic azine, oxazine or polymethine, or aminoazo \n\ncompounds.\n[114]\n\n These dyes are not water soluble and sometimes require de addition of \n\nacid, to produce dye solutions. Acetic acid is often used on these formulations. \n[109,110]\n\n \n\nBasic dyes are frequently employed on the coloration of materials with anionic nature, \n\nwhere strong electrostatic attractions may be established. Examples of such materials \n\ninclude protein fibres (e.g. wool, silk and leather), synthetic polyamides (such as nylon) \n\nand pulp containing lignin (e.g. unbleached pulp or ground wood). Additionally, these dyes \n\n(high cationic charge) also exhibit a high attraction towards fillers. \n[110,111,114]\n\n Conversely, \n\nbleached pulps affinity with basic dyes is very poor, and for that reason these dyes are \n\noften not considered suitable for these materials coloration. \n[111]\n\n Even though its use is \n\ndecreasing on paper industry, these dyes are still used on the production of packing papers \n\n(liner, testliner, corrugating medium), or wood-containing printing/writing papers.\n[109,110]\n\n \n\nTo improve dye fixation anionic fixatives may be added (for example, sodium salts \n\nof condensation of formaldehyde, naphthalene sulfonic acid). The use of fixatives is \n\nusually related with bleached pulps dyeing, which contain very low amounts of lignin. \n\nThey allow an enhanced dye fixation, richer colours, along with improved bleedfastness. \n\nMoreover, since dye fixation is more efficient, effluents become less stained.\n[110]\n\n \n\nBasic dyes usually exhibit brilliant colour and advantageous dyeing costs. They also \n\ndisplay good fastness to water and steam on lignin containing materials (due to their good \n\nfixation on these materials). \n[109,110]\n\n However, despite the referred benefits, the \n\ndisadvantages associated with its use include the already mentioned poor affinity towards \n\nAnionic Direct \nDyes \n52% \n\nCationic Direct \nDyes \n6% \n\nBasic Dyes \n28% \n\nAcid Dyes \n2% \n\nPigments \n12% \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 54 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nbleached materials, mottling tendency (which affects the uniformity of the dyed material) \n\nand poor light fastness. Many of these dyes are becoming obsolete, but a few are still used \n\nfor dyeing paper, leather and for inks manufacture. \n[109,114]\n\n \n\nii) Acid Dyes (Anionic dyes) \n\nAcid dyes or anionic dyes are water-soluble salts of organic acids (often potassium or \n\nsodium salts). Most acid dyes are azo dyes and are quite similar to direct dyes. They \n\ncontain one or more water-solubilising anionic groups, mostly sulfonic acid groups of \n\nsodium salts. When in water they dissociate into coloured anions. \n[110\u2013112,115]\n\n \n\nAlthough basic dyes exhibit high solubility, more sulfonic acid groups on their \n\nstructure (meant to improve solubility) may cost these dye\u2019s affinity and/or substantivity \n\nfor their substrates, yielding thus poor bleed fastness or coloured effluents. An example \n\nwould be its poor affinity towards cellulosic fibres. Even though acid dyes are able to \n\ndiffuse inside fibres, the use of fixatives is required (often aluminium sulfate and cationic \n\nfixative agents, such as condensation products of dicyandiamide with formaldehyde, \n\npolyamines, polyvinylamines). \n[109\u2013111]\n\n Since cellulose is anionic in aqueous medium, dyes \n\nmay be only attracted by means of hydrogen bonding or through Van der Waals forces. To \n\nprompt that situation, it is rather important that dye molecules approach very closely \n\ncellulose molecules, for what dye molecules linearity and/or planarity is essential. \n[111]\n\n \n\nThese dyes are of limited use in paper industry and are mainly applied on textile \n\nfibres with cationic character, such as protein fibres (wool, silk and leather) or synthetic \n\npolyamides (nylon). \n[111]\n\n \n\nFurther disadvantages include strongly coloured effluents and poor bleed fastness. \n\nAdvantages of acid dyes are their solubility, no tendency to mottle on stock mixtures, and \n\nits suitability for dip and surface dyeing. Acid dyes are mainly used for certain types of \n\npaper, decorative crepe paper, and carbon paper. The importance of acid dyes for paper \n\ndyeing has decreased greatly not only due to its poor cost/performance ratio but also due to \n\nthe aforementioned effluents issues. \n[109\u2013111]\n\n \n\niii) Direct Dyes \n\nIn paper industry, direct dyes otherwise known as substantive dyes, are the most \n\nimportant and extensively used dyeing materials. These dyes are divided into cationic and \n\nanionic, as demonstrated by Figure 2. 21. \n[110,111]\n\n As the name suggests, substantivity (the \n\nability to absorb onto fibres from an aqueous medium) is here an essential requirement, \n\nalong with affinity (the ability to become bound to the fibre). \n[111,116]\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 55 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nAnionic direct dyes  \n\nFrom all direct dyes, anionic dyes are the far most widely used on tissue paper \n\nproduction, and on printing/writing paper production. These dyes are quite similar to acid \n\ndyes and their structure includes groups responsible for enhancing water solubility, mostly \n\n\u2013SO3. Due to their larger, linear and/or planar molecular structure they have a higher \n\nsubstantivity and affinity towards cellulose, relatively to acid dyes. \n[109\u2013111]\n\n \n\nMost anionic direct dyes are polyazo dyes, with structures consisting, mainly, on \n\nazobenzene, naphthalene, biphenyl, stilbene and aromatic heterocycles. Another group are \n\ncopper phthalocyanines. Due to these molecules structure, it becomes easier to get closer to \n\ncellulose molecules and interact with then (through hydrogen bonds, Van der Waals forces, \n\nand/or hydrophobic interactions). They exhibit good affinity towards bleached chemical \n\npulps and they may be applied over a wide pH range, yielding good fastness properties. \n\n[110,111]\n \n\nFixatives or fixing agents are added to achieve deep shades with good bleed fastness \n\n(e.g. deeply coloured napkins). Inside the fibre, the cationic compounds precipitate the \n\nanionic dyes, still in solution, by forming with dyes higher molecular mass aggregates, \n\nwith lower solubility, which causes its precipitation inside fibres. Therefore, dye removal \n\nbecomes more difficult. These additives consist mainly on quaternary ammonium \n\ncompounds and cationic formaldehyde condensation resins. These dyes are not suitable to \n\nwood containing feedstocks, since wood components prevent a uniform dyeing process. Its \n\nlightfastness is usually good, but the colour attained may not be as brilliant as that on acid \n\nand basic dyes. \n[110,116]\n\n \n\nCationic direct dyes \n\nCationic direct dyes, alike anionic direct dyes, display a planar molecular structure, \n\nbut with cationic groups. The cationic charge, when compared with anionic charge (water \n\nsolubility and repulsive forces), allows an improved attraction between fibres and dye \n\nmolecules, and thus an excellent dye fixation. Due to the anionic character of cellulose in \n\nwater, a cationic dye can form strong electrostatic interactions besides the usual weaker \n\nhydrogen bonds, or Van der Waals\u2019. \n[109\u2013111]\n\n \n\nThere are many types of cationic groups besides quaternary ammonium groups. \n\nThese dyes molecules may contain pyridinium pyridine, thiazolium, benzthiazonlium, \n\nindolium and triazolium cationic groups. \n[109\u2013111]\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 56 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nConversely, the presence of positive charges does not favour the dyeing process of \n\nmechanical fibres. When this is not the case, these dyes originate good bleedfastness and \n\ntheir combination with anionic direct dyes may be used to enhance dye fixation.\n[109,110]\n\n \n\niv) Other dyes \n\nOther classes of dyes include sulfur dyes, pigments, reactive dyes, vat dyes, \n\ndisperse dyes, mordant dyes, etc. While the first two are still applied to cellulosic fibres to \n\na small extent, the others find little or no use in paper industry. Although they may be \n\napplied to cotton or other fibres (wool, silk, etc) coloration on textile industry. \n[110,111,113]\n\n  \n\n2.4.2.2. Influences on the dyeing process \n\nThe dyeing process can be influenced by many aspects, such as the fibres chemical \n\ncomposition, dyes substantivity and affinity towards cellulosic fibres, type of forces \n\nestablished between dyes and fibres, process conditions (e.g. temperature, agitation, pH, \n\nand others), etc. \n[111]\n\n \n\nAs previously referred the feedstock composition can influence fibres dying process, \n\nsince different types of pulp (bleached or mechanical pulps) display different affinities \n\ntowards the same dye. This sensibility towards stock variations, may create issues as \n\nconcerns the dye fixation, which often requires the use of chemical additives, such as \n\nfixatives to settle these setbacks. Moreover, pulp refining also influences fibres dying. If \n\nfibres were previously refined shade variations may occur, since beaten and fibrillated \n\nfibres are more accessible towards dyes relatively to unbeaten ones.\n[109,111,117]\n\n \n\nOther process conditioning parameters include pulp consistency (could originate non \n\nuniform coloration), water hardness (helps reducing repulsive forces between fibres and \n\ndyes), fillers content (consumes dyes and gives weaker depths of colour), fixatives \n\n(cationic products added to aid dye fixation), and moist content (certain dyes are affected \n\nby moisture yielding changes in shade). The order of additives addition (dye, fixatives, etc) \n\nalso plays a rather relevant role on the dyeing process, being able to affect greatly the dye \n\nfixation, the products colour uniformity, etc.\n[109,111,117]\n\n \n\nThe type of dyes selected may also influence the process. Its substantivity and \n\naffinity play a key role on the process. Substantivity consists on the ability of the dye to be \n\nabsorbed by cellulose fibres from an aqueous medium, while affinity is the capacity of the \n\ndye to be bound to the fibre. Therefore, if a dye possesses high substantivity, due to low \n\naffinity it may exhibit poor fastness. Similarly, a dye with low substantivity and high \n\naffinity will create coloured effluents, but good fastness properties. It is thus essential, \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 57 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nduring dye selection, to look for dyes with both high substantivity and affinity for fibres, \n\nfor a more efficient process. \n[111]\n\n \n\nThe interactions existing between dye and fibres also affect dye fixation and fastness \n\nproperties. Generally, the dyeing process starts with the dye migration towards the fibres \n\ninterface followed by its adsorption. Then the dye molecules diffuse from the surface into \n\nthe fibres interior. Afterwards, dye molecules are fixed to fibres, either by hydrogen bonds, \n\ncovalent bonds, or other type of physical interactions, depending on the type of dye and \n\nother materials involved on the dyeing process. \n[113]\n\n \n\nThis process may also be conditioned by electro-potential forces, temperature and \n\nagitation. When immersed on water or aqueous solution every fibre exhibits a certain \n\nelectric potential, usually designated as zeta potential. For example, cellulose, exhibits \n\nnegative charge when immerse in neutral solution. Given the case of acid dyes or even \n\nanionic direct dyes, in solution, these are negatively charged. Therefore, they will be \n\nrepelled by the opposite charge, such as the case of cellulosic fibres. On the other hand, \n\nbeing the substrate wool (proteins), under its isoelectric point, it displays positive charge, \n\ntherefore this substrate will be attracted towards negatively charges dye molecules. \n[113,118]\n\n \n\nWhen there is a mutual repulsion between the fibre and dye, higher times are \n\nrequired before the inherent vibration to the molecules in solution have brought them near \n\nenough cellulosic fibres. The problem, therefore, is to accelerate the migration to the \n\nsurface of the fibre. This may be achieved by increasing temperature, which promotes \n\nvibrational activity, and also by the addition of electrolytes that counteract the effect of the \n\nnegative zeta potential. \n[113]\n\n  \n\nThe effect of agitation is only apparent, when the amount of dye in the solution is \n\nlimited. Under such conditions the diffusion into the fibre could be quicker than the \n\nassembly at the surface and agitation will then become a significant factor. The rate of \n\ndiffusion into the fibre is obviously dependent upon the concentration of dye in the \n\ninterfacial layer, this can under certain conditions be influenced by the degree of agitation. \n\n[113]\n \n\n2.4.2.3. Colour evaluation \n\nTo attain a certain shade, one or more dyes (mixture) may be used. Liquid or \n\npowder dyes are stored and them pumped (dye dilution is often required) automatically \n\ninto the stock. Afterwards, the colour of the produced papers is analysed by a colorimeter \n\nor a spectrophotometer to evaluate if the produced shade agrees with the desired one. If not \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 58 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nadjustments on process variables have to be performed.\n[111]\n\n The colour evaluation is often \n\nperformed by analysis of samples colour space coordinates and K/S values. \n\ni) CIE L*a*b colour space coordinates \n\nHuman eye is not able to quantify colour accurately, thus colour measurement is \n\nessential for matching coloured samples, determining colour differences and adjust dyeing \n\nparameters. Understanding the fundamentals of colour measurement, or colorimetry, is \n\nessential for the optimum use of this technology.\n[119]\n\n \n\nSpace colour coordinates are used as a way to express colour. CIE \u201cCommission \n\nInternationale de L\u2019Eclairage\u201d (light and colour science authority) has defined three colour \n\nspace types, CIE XYZ, CIE L*C*h and CIE L*a*b*. Being this last the most extensively \n\nused. \n[109,119]\n\n \n\nIn CIE L*a*b space coordinates every colour is described by three coordinates L*, \n\na* and b*. L* represents the samples lightness/darkness, while a* represents the degree of \n\nred/green, where +a* implies a redder colouration and \u2013a* a greener colouration. As \n\nconcerns b*, this last represents the degree of yellow/blue where +b* is indicative of a \n\nyellower colouration whilst \u2013b* indicates a bluer one. \n[109,119]\n\n \n\nConsidering the abovementioned coordinates system, it is possible to perceive that \n\nneutral shades (whites, greys blacks) will be positioned near the L axis, although not all \n\nwhite papers imply L*=100 neither black paper imply L=0. \n[109,119]\n\nWhen a certain colour \n\nsuch as red or yellow is added, it possible that L* will be reduced (since the amount of \n\nlight reflected is lower) and a* and b* coordinates will vary accordingly with the added \n\ncolour. For example, if red is added, a* will increase (+a*), while blue will originate a \n\ndevelopment of \u2013b*.\n[109,119]\n\n \n\nSimplistically, if a red colour is added, this will result in an increase in the +a* value, \n\nwhilst a blue colour will result in an increase in the \u2013b* value. \n[109,119]\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. 22 - CIE L*a*b system.\n[109]\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 59 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\n \n\nFigure 2. 23 - Schematic explanation of the model. \n[109]\n\n \n\nTo analyse the produced shade of colour with the desired one the colour coordinates \n\nare used to determine the colour differences, which are defined by the absolute difference \n\nbetween the samples and a reference sample. For each coordinate this difference is named \n\ndelta (?), as may be either negative or positive. The ?L* parameter represents the \n\ndifference as regards coordinate L*, which suggests if the samples are lighter (positive) or \n\ndarker (negative), relatively to the reference. On the other hand, ?a* describes the \n\ndifference between red and green, i.e. if the samples are redder (positive) or greener \n\n(negative), while ?b* defines if the samples are yellower (positive) or bluer (negative). \n\n[109,119,120]\n \n\nThe total colour difference between all three coordinates is named ?E*. The \n\ndetermination of colour difference is usually derived through the CIELab 1976 equation \n\n(Equation 2.15).\n[109,119,120]\n\n \n\n??\n?\n= ?(???)2 + (???)2 + (???)2  Equation 2. 15 \n\nIt is possible to establish a connection between ?E and the human eye. This \n\ncorrelation is represented in Table 2. 6, where ?E values are related with a standard \n\nobserver perceptions.\n[120]\n\n \n\nTable 2. 6 \u2013 Generic correlation between ?E values and a standard observer perception. \n[120]\n\n \n\n?E Perception \n\n0 \u2013 1 The observer does not notice the difference \n\n1 \u2013 2 Only experienced observer can notice the difference \n\n2 \u2013 3.5 Unexperienced observer also notices the difference \n\n3.5 \u2013 5 Clear difference in colour is noticed, \n\nLarger than 5 Observer notices two different colours \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 60 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nii) Kubelka-Munk model \n\nColour may also be analysed quantitatively. For opaque materials Kubelka-Munk \n\nequation\n[121]\n\n correlates a sample\u2019s spectral reflectance (R%), its absorption (K) and its \n\nscattering (S) features. Kubelka-Munk relationship is given by Equation 2.16, where K is \n\nthe coefficient of absorption, S the coefficient of scatter and R the reflectance of the sample \n\nat a given wavelength. To a first approximation K and S are proportional to the \n\nconcentration of each dye in the substrate.\n[119,122\u2013124]\n\n \n\n? ?? =\n(1??)2\n\n2?\n   Equation 2. 16 \n\nThis relationship is rather useful when formulating colours on textile, coatings and \n\npaper industry. In these cases, it is presumed that the scattering (S) of a dye depends on the \n\nproperties of the substance, whereas absorption (K) of light depends on the properties of \n\nthe dye. The value of K/S is considered to have a proportional relationship relatively to dye \n\nconcentration (C) on the material (equation 2.17).\n[123,125]\n\n \n\n? ?? ? ? ?   Equation 2. 17 \n\nThis assumption is considered when intended to relate a materials appearance with \n\nthe kind and amounts of dyes in it. This parameter plays an essential role on products \n\ncolour formulation. The colour yield of dyeing is the depth of colour that a unit mass of \n\ndye is able to impart to the dyed substrate. It can be assessed visually, but a more \n\nquantitative measurement is possible using the Kubelka\u2013Munk K/S.\n[122,124,125]\n\n \n\n2.4.3. Antimicrobial agents \n\nConsumers concerns and thus demand for antimicrobial products, as a way to contain \n\nmicroorganism\u2019s contamination has driven the development of new differentiated products, \n\nwith antimicrobial features. \n[126,127]\n\n An example would be the case of tissue papers, namely \n\nCascade\u2019s new antimicrobial tissue paper.\n[128,129]\n\n  \n\nTissue papers being made of natural fibres (cellulose) are susceptible to \n\nmicroorganism\u2019s life and growth, however the use of antimicrobial agents is a way to \n\nprevent its growth and propagation, which may result in sanitary issues or harm human \n\nhealth. \n[126,127]\n\n \n\nAntimicrobials may differ in terms of chemical structure, effectiveness, method of \n\napplication, influence on people and on the environment, as well as on cost.\n[126,127,130]\n\n \n\nTo obtain an effective action, an ideal antimicrobial treatment should meet a few \n\nrequirements, such as being effective against a broad spectrum of bacterial and fungal \n\nspecies, but also, at the same time, display low toxicity to consumers. It should also be \n\ndurable (be active for a long period of time). It must also be compatible with the chemical \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 61 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nprocesses, in which it will be included, be cost effective and not be harmful to either the \n\nmanufacturer or the environment. \n[131,132]\n\n \n\nAntimicrobial agents either inhibit the growth (-static) or kill (-cidal) the \n\nmicroorganisms. For example, antimicrobial agents used in commercial textiles, e.g. silver \n\nnanoparticles, triclosan, polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) and quaternary ammonium \n\ncompounds, are biocides. They act either by damaging microorganisms cell wall or alter \n\ncell membrane permeability, denature proteins, inhibit enzyme activity or inhibit lipid \n\nsynthesis, all of which are essential for cell survival.\n[130,131,133\u2013136]\n\n \n\nAntimicrobial agents are already employed in many different areas and materials. \n\nThey are used as food preservatives, disinfectants, swimming pool sanitizers or in wound \n\ndressings. Although these agents exhibit a powerful bactericidal activity, their attachment \n\nto fibres (such as cellulosic fibres) may reduce its activity and limit its availability. For \n\nthese reasons, higher amounts of these compound need to be applied to control bacterial \n\ngrowth and to preserve the antimicrobial activity for longer periods.\n[126,131,137]\n\n \n\nSome antimicrobials investigated or used on textile industry, the closest to the tissue \n\nindustry, include quaternary ammonium compounds, N-halamines, chitosan, halogenated \n\nphenols (well-known triclosan), polybiguanides, nanoparticles of noble metals and metal \n\noxides, and plant based antimicrobial agents (e.g. polyphenols, essential oils, etc).\n[131,138\u2013\n\n140]\n Despite the wide variety of possibilities, only PHMB will be further discussed, because \n\nit was used in the present work. \n\n2.4.3.1. Polybiguanides \n\nPolybiguanides, are an example of effective antimicrobial agents, which consist on \n\npolymeric polycationic amines, with cationic biguanide repeating units separated by \n\nhydrocarbon chain linkers of identical or dissimilar length. \n[126,137,140]\n\n \n\nPolyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) is a well-known strong and broad spectrum \n\nantimicrobial agent with low toxicity, which has attracted the attention for antimicrobial \n\nfinishing in textile industry, mainly for the protection of cellulose fibres. This compound is \n\nfrequently used as a disinfectant in the food industry and in the sanitization of swimming \n\npools. It is also being explored as a biocide in mouthwashes and wound dressings. \n\n[131,137,140,141]\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. 24 \u2013 PHMB chemical structure. \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 62 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nPHMB acts by undermining the integrity of the cell membrane. Its cationic \n\nmolecules interact with the anionic phospholipids in the microbe\u2019s cell membrane, \n\nincreasing its permeability to the point of its disruption, which ends with cells\u2019 death.\n[133\u2013\n\n136,138]\n \n\nPHMB antimicrobial activity increases with increasing degree of polymerization, \n\nwhich is related with the higher number of sites (biguanide units) available to interact with \n\nmicrobe\u2019s cell wall. However, as higher is the molecular weight, the lower is the solubility \n\nof PHMB.\n[126,131] \n\nPHMB cationic nature allows it to interact with cellulose, not only through hydrogen \n\nbonds, but also through ionic interactions. In literature it is mentioned that PHMB can bind \n\nto cellulose through its anionic carboxylic groups. As mentioned before, besides promoting \n\na higher antimicrobial activity, polymer length also provides more cationic sites, for \n\ninteraction with cellulose, and thus a stronger binding. For low concentrations electrostatic \n\ninteractions between PHMB and carboxylic groups in the cellulose are dominating. \n\nHowever, with increasing of PHMB concentration, hydrogen bonding between PHMB and \n\ncellulose, becomes dominating, and thus multilayer adsorption is preferential. \n[131,140,141]\n\n \n\n2.4.3.2. Functionalization with antimicrobials \n\nAntimicrobial features may be conveyed to materials by functionalization of those \n\nwith antimicrobial agents. In case of synthetic fibres, antimicrobial agents may be added \n\nbefore extrusion rendering synthetic fibres with antimicrobial features. In other cases, such \n\nas natural fibres (e.g. cellulose), antimicrobial agents are applied to fibres by impregnation. \n\nThen, this agents get attached to fibres either by formation of covalent bonds, electrostatic \n\ninteractions, hydrogen bond or Van der Waals interactions.\n[130,138]\n\n \n\nAnother approach for the functionalization of materials with antimicrobials, includes \n\nthe use of encapsulated antimicrobial agents, for posterior application on fibres. \n[142]\n\n \n\nMicroencapsulation is defined as a technology of packaging solids, liquids, or \n\ngaseous materials in miniature, sealed capsules that can release their contents at controlled \n\nrates under specific conditions (example Figure 2. 25). \n[142,143]\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. 25 \u2013 Schematic representation of a capsule containing antimicrobial compounds (adapted from \n[144]\n\n). \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 63 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nIn the case of textile industry, the closest to tissue paper, encapsulation is used for \n\ndurable fragrances, skin softeners, insect repellents, dyes, vitamins, antimicrobial agents, \n\nphase change materials and medical applications (antibiotics, hormones and other \n\ndrugs).\n[145]\n\n \n\nThe encapsulation of compounds, conveys protection towards harmful conditions, \n\nfrom its surroundings, such as, heat, acidity, oxidation, moisture, etc. Additionally, it averts \n\nthe interaction between the encapsulated with its surrounding, which, in some cases, avoids \n\nnegative effects. Besides, it allows a controlled and prolonged release of the bioactive \n\nprinciple. Additionally, it may improve chemicals handling, and reduce its exposure to \n\nworkers or consumers.\n[145,146]\n\n This approach has been broadly explored, over the last years, \n\nespecially for drug delivery, and in this context, different types of carriers have been \n\ninvestigated, such as liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, silica nanocapsules, solid lipid \n\nnanoparticles, etc.\n[147\u2013149]\n\n \n\nThis methodology purposes aim to reduce the amount of antimicrobial applied, for a \n\nmore cost-efficient utilization of antimicrobial agent. Furthermore, the possibility of \n\nnegative effects on the end product, such as undesired variations on products properties \n\n(due to the interactions of the antimicrobial with the product compounds) or secondary \n\neffects on consumers (skin irritation), may be attenuated by using encapsulated \n\nantimicrobial compounds relatively to non-encapsulated. Besides, this strategy also enables \n\na more controlled release of bioactive principle. Therefore, encapsulation of antimicrobials \n\nhas appeared as an alternative to attenuate the aforementioned problematics.\n[144,147,150,151]\n\n  \n\nSilica nanostructures have been looked up with interest as a bioactive principles \n\ncarrier. Its porous structure enables a more controlled release (mesoporous uniform \n\nstructure), with a tuneable pore size, high surface area, non-toxic nature, etc. A good \n\nexample of this includes hollow silica nanospheres, which enable a high bioactive principle \n\nstorage and its controlled release. Recently, the synthesis of silica capsules with PHMB has \n\nbeen demonstrated.\n[152]\n\n \n\n2.4.3. Perfumes \n\nThe pleasant odour of a product may play as a powerful motivator towards its \n\npurchase. Therefore, perfumed products consist of an approach, which presume the \n\ndifferentiation by manufacturing appealing products to consumer\u2019s senses (e.g. perfumed \n\ntissue papers). It is noteworthy that human\u2019s sense of smell identifies not only the quality \n\nof different odours, but, it also associates it (often unconsciously) with feelings ranging \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 64 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nfrom agreeable to unpleasant. Therefore, perfumed products become more attractive while \n\nunpleasant smells are used for the opposite purpose. \n[153\u2013155]\n\n \n\nMany companies have followed this strategy through the years, by developing scent \n\nbased trademark products.\n[156]\n\n Consumers relish on products carrying a pleasant fragrance. \n\nThere are plenty examples of perfumed products, ranging from scented letters to washed \n\ntextile fabrics and so forth. \n[157]\n\n A good well known example are Renova scented facial \n\ntissue papers (Figure 2. 26) \n\n \n\nFigure 2. 26\u2013 Examples of some of Renova scented tissue papers. \n\nPerfumes or fragrances are generally made of volatile compounds collected from a \n\nwide variety of plants, grasses, spices, herbs, woods and flowers, such as orange blossoms, \n\njasmine, rose and lavender.\n[158]\n\n Besides natural origin fragrances, there are also those of \n\nsynthetic origin. All these compounds consist on organic volatile molecules, which are \n\noften found on gas or liquid state. These compounds include a panoply of compounds such \n\nas alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, acids sulfides, etc. \n[159]\n\n \n\nTo manufacture perfumed products, these are often treated with fragrances, \n\ntypically by spraying, coating or dipping, with a perfume/fragrance. However, the effects \n\nof the fragrance on substrates, wears off rapidly. The development of attractive and durable \n\nperfumes has been a long-time aspiration of industry. Ergo, research for controlled-release \n\nfragrances, as a way to extend fragrance longevity, have been a rather investigated subject \n\nduring the last decades. Once again, similarly to antimicrobial agents (previous section \n\n2.4.3.), encapsulation appears as a good way to control fragrance release and turn it more \n\ndurable. \n[154,157]\n\n \n\nEncapsulation allows an improved performance and stability of perfumes \n\n(substantivity, tenacity or endurance), which tends to wear off by evaporation, interactions \n\nwith other components, oxidation or degradation. Similarly to before (antimicrobials, \n\nsection 2.4.3.), by resorting to perfumes encapsulation, it is possible to protect them from \n\nsurrounding adverse conditions (temperature, pH, water, etc), and therefore achieve a more \n\ncontrolled and longer perfume release. Additionally, it facilitates its handling (e.g. most of \n\nthe synthetic nitro- and polycyclic musks used in perfumes, are toxic and non-\n\nbiodegradable), improves its affinity towards the substrate, reduces losses, requires less \n\namounts of perfume, etc.\n[154,159\u2013161]\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 65 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nSimilarly to before, capsules may be produced from various materials, with a \n\nvariety of shapes (spherical, oblong or irregular, monolithic or aggregates), with single or \n\nmultiple walls. \n[154,160]\n\n Amongst the most commonly used materials are polysaccharides \n\nand sugars (gums, starches, celluloses, cyclodextrin, dextrose, etc), proteins (gelatin, \n\ncasein, soy protein, etc), lipids (waxes, paraffin oils, fats, etc), inorganics (silicates, clays, \n\ncalcium sulfate, etc) and synthetics (acrylic polymers, poly(vinylpyrrolidone), etc). \n[154,159]\n\n \n\nAlthough when preparing capsules, it is important to bear in bind its end-use, which is a \n\ndetermining factor for the selection of the most appropriate material. For example, the \n\nencapsulation of perfumes in silica nanostructured appear as a rather promising \n\nencapsulation method for certain applications. Capsules do not swell or change under pH \n\nchanges, or temperature variations, alike some many other materials, such as polymers. \n\nOther advantages include its inertness, transparency, thermal protection of the active \n\ningredient, protection towards oxidation, it high mechanical resistance, nontoxicity and \n\nbiocompatibility. Besides enables the encapsulation of both water-based and oil-based \n\nliquids.\n[154,160\u2013162]\n\n \n\n2.5. Ultra-high pressure \n\nHigh pressure processing, also known as high hydrostatic pressure or ultra-high \n\npressure (UHP) has been applied for many years on the production of ceramics, composite \n\nmaterials, plastics and artificial diamond, representing nowadays an expanding technology \n\nin food industry. \n[163\u2013165]\n\n Recently this technique was applied for the modification of \n\nbiopolymers\n[166\u2013173]\n\n and called attention with relation to improve the performance of tissue \n\npapers. \n\n2.5.1. Fundaments \n\nUltra-hydrostatic high pressure technology (UHP) has revealed a substantial growth \n\nduring the last years, particularly in what concerns food industry, for food processing and \n\npreservation, due to the advantages it reveals relatively to other thermal processes. \n[163]\n\n \n\nThis technology uses elevated pressure conditions (100-1000 MPa), which are \n\ntransmitted through a fluid, often water. The technology is based on 3 main principles, Le \n\nChatlier principle, the isostatic principles and the microscopic ordering principle. Le \n\nChatelier principle\n[174]\n\n, states that any phenomena in equilibrium (chemical reaction, phase \n\ntransition, etc) accompanied by a disturbance tends to counter it. So, in case of a pressure \n\nincrease, any phenomenon (e.g., chemical reactions, phase transitions or changes in the \n\nmolecular configuration) which is accompanied by a decrease in volume is enhanced and \n\nvice-versa. Since many biochemical reactions include volume variations, therefore \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 66 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nbiological processes are affected by pressure. UHP mainly affects non-covalent bonds such \n\nas hydrogen, electrostatic, etc, meaning that low molecular weight components are \n\nnormally less affected whereas high molecules components are more sensitive to \n\nUHP.\n[168,175,176]\n\n \n\nThe isostatic principle,\n[168,175]\n\n is also present on this technology and it implies that \n\npressure is applied instantaneous and uniformly, regardless of the samples dimensions (in \n\ncase of solid samples their format remains intact). This particularity constitutes a huge \n\nbenefit, as concerns heat treatments (such as thermal pasteurization), since temperature \n\ntreatments do not allow a uniformly distribution of temperature, generating temperature \n\ngradients, and due to the high temperatures samples are subjected, it may affect \n\nthermosensitive compounds. \n[168,175,176]\n\n \n\nFinally, the microscopic ordering principle\n[168,175]\n\n states that upon constant \n\ntemperature an increase in pressure increases the degrees of ordering of molecules of a \n\ngiven substance.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2. 27 \u2013 Schematic representation of the isostatic principle.\n[176]\n\n \n\n2.5.2. UHP applications and effects \n\n UHP may be found in many applications, in food industry and for biotechnological \n\napplications, its major effects include (i) microorganisms inactivation, (ii) biopolymers \n\nmodification (protein denaturation, protein activation/deactivation, gel formation, etc (iii) \n\nability to retain food products quality, specially colour and flavour (since UHP mainly \n\naffects non-covalent bonds) and (iv) effects on products functionality (changes on density \n\nand texture).\n[177]\n\n However, only biopolymer modification by UHP will be given focus, \n\nsince corresponds to the essence of current work. \n\nAs mentioned above UHP treatment is able to induce changes on structural and \n\nfunctional level of biomolecules, and example of this would be enzymes denaturation or \n\nstarch gelatinization. \n[163\u2013168,170\u2013173,176,178\u2013184]\n\n Additionally, more recently, changes in \n\ncellulose structure, have also been demonstrated.\n[169,185,186]\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 67 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nStudies performed by Figueiredo et al\n[169]\n\n with kraft and sulfite pulps under pressure \n\ncondition of 400MPa, demonstrated structural changes in cellulose. It was demonstrated \n\nthat during UHP treatment the crystallites average width in fibrils increases, as result from \n\npartial cocristalization of crystalline regions on adjacent elementary fibrils, when \n\nfavourably orientated and free of noncellulosic compounds. Additionally, it was also \n\nrevealed that UHP induces forced hydration on amorphous regions enabling an improving \n\nof fibres swelling abilities, and thus decreasing the hornification effect affecting them. \n\nMoreover, treated fibres became more flexible and elastic rendering improved mechanical \n\nproperties. Due to forced hydration on amorphous and crystalline regions, fibrils became \n\nless aggregated and thus more accessible towards chemical reactants, namely diluted \n\nsulfuric acid.\n[169]\n\n \n\nThe improved accessibility of cellulose pre-treated with UHP, was also demonstrated \n\nas regards enzymes.\n[185,186]\n\n This was demonstrated when treating E. globulus kraft pulp \n\nwith cellulase and xylanase (Figure 2. 28). In these studies, it was verified that UHP pre-\n\ntreatment, similarly to before, induced forced hydration, and therefore rearrangements that \n\npromoted fibril disaggregation and thus higher accessibility towards sites previously \n\ninaccessible. Owing to these facts the accessibility of enzymes towards cellulose was \n\nhigher and therefore higher rate and degrees of hydrolysis were achieved. \n[185,186]\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. 28 \u2013 Schematic representation of UHP effect on cellulosic fibres accessibility towards cellulases.\n[185]\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. 29 \u2013 Images of two of hydrostatic high pressure equipments owned by the University of Aveiro. On the left is \n\nthe Hyperbaric 55 with a 55 L capacity and on the right is the High-pressure U33 with a capacity of 100mL. \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 68 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\nIt is yet to discover the effect of UHP on other types of fibres, specially recycled \n\nfibres, which are highly affected by hornification. This constitutes a rather curious topic \n\nsince papermaking industry feedstock is not solely based on E. globulus pulps. Besides the \n\neffect of high pressure towards other types of chemical/reactants commonly used on \n\npapermaking industry also poses and intriguing topic as concerns fibres modification and \n\nits process efficiency. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 69 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter II | Bibliographic Review \n\n2.6.

Introduction \n\nWith nowadays environmental issues, recycling is recognized as a path towards a \n\nmore sustainable future. A good example is paper recycling. Its benefits are not only \n\neconomical, but also environmental.\n[1]\n\n Although attractive, materials recycling still pose a \n\nfew drawbacks, such as the number of times recycling is possible due to materials \n\ndegradation. \n[1,2]\n\n In the case of paper recycling, the use of recycled pulp still exhibits \n\ndisadvantages relatively to virgin fibres, which are essentially related to (i) feedstock \n\nvariability, (ii) losses on fibres mechanical/physical properties, (iii) hornification, (iv) and \n\nimpurities.\n[1\u20135]\n\n \n\nOverall authors agree that the main responsible for recycled pulp properties loss is \n\nthe hornification effect. The hornification effect occurs mostly due to the formation of \n\nirreversible hydrogen bonds, between fibrils, yielding fibril aggregation, fibre collapse, \n\nstiffening, inability to swell as originally and hence losses on mechanical and hydration \n\nproperties. \n[2,6,7]\n\n These structural changes occur mostly due to successive swelling, \n\npressing, drying, printing, storing, re-dispersing and deinking processes. \n[2,3,7\u201310]\n\n \n\nThe inability of fibres to swell like originally represents a rather relevant matter, \n\nsince by becoming stiff and less malleable, these features are transmitted to its end \n\nproducts. Besides, the stress fibres are subjected during their life cycles further intensifies \n\nthe hornification effect, leading towards a continuous loss on fibres properties. \n[6\u201310]\n\n \n\nThe aptitude of fibres for hornification depends on different variables, such as the \n\nwood origin, the pulping method, fibres biometry, storage conditions and chemical \n\ncomposition.\n[6,7]\n\n For example, it has been demonstrated that hornification affects easier low \n\nyield pulps relatively to high yield pulp. This difference is related to a higher lignin and \n\nhemicellulose content, such as the case of high yield pulps, which act as a barrier against \n\nthe formation of irreversible hydrogen bond formation between fibrils.\n[2,6,7]\n\n \n\nAlthough impurities also affect fibres properties hornification is still considered the \n\nmajor responsible for the losses felt on the recycled fibres properties. \n[2,11]\n\n In pulp and \n\npaper industry these losses are considered a major issue, since they comprise a hindrance \n\nnot only for manufacture but also as regards the end-products features. To surpass these \n\nissues methods have been developed, through time, as a way to diminish the negative \n\neffects brought by hornification on fibres. These methods include beating, chemical \n\ntreatment with alkaline solutions, mixture with virgin fibres, fibres fractionation and more \n\nrecently enzymatic treatment. \n[2,3,7\u201310]\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 84 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  \n \n\nIn tissue paper industry besides recycled fibres, virgin fibres are also extensively \n\nused for the production of tissue paper. Being pulps absorbency (hydration abilities), \n\nsoftness and its capacity to maintain integrity (mechanical properties) considered as the \n\nmost important features on tissue paper, with special emphasis on absorbency.\n[12,13]\n\n Fibres \n\nability to interact with water molecules (facial tissue) and became softer, or its ability to \n\nabsorb vast amounts of water (kitchen paper towels), is essential to tissue paper industry. \n\nTo evaluate materials hydration different methods may be followed, such as moisture \n\nsorption isotherms, capillary rise tests, contact angle analysis, etc. There are numerous \n\ntests, which enable the evaluation of a fibres ability to interact with water, which could be \n\nseen an indirect measurement of pulp accessibility towards OH groups, as mentioned in the \n\nprevious chapter. \n\nUltra-High pressure (UHP) emerges here as a non-degrading alternative technology \n\nwith the ability to decrease hornification on fibres and improve its accessibility. The \n\npotential of UHP on cellulosic pulps has been demonstrated in literature, as concerns E. \n\nglobulus kraft pulp and sulfite pulps, and is fully described in the previous chapter. It has \n\nbeen shown that UHP induces structural rearrangements on cellulosic fibres, rendering \n\nimproved accessibility and reduced hornification to cellulosic fibres. \n[14\u201316]\n\n \n\nHowever, there is still much to explore as concerns the use of UHP treatment for the \n\nmodification of recycled fibres, which are highly affected by hornification and which \n\nbehaviour under UHP conditions is unknown. With these in mind, the main purpose of the \n\nwork displayed on this chapter was to evaluate the effect of UHP on recycled and different \n\nvirgin fibres (hardwood and softwood fibres). Additionally, changes in its properties were \n\nevaluated, with special emphasis on its hydration properties and its ability to introduce \n\nstrongly bound water. All this allowed the evaluation, for the first time, of the hydration \n\nbehaviour of recycled fibres.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 85 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  \n\n3.2. Materials and Methods \n\nDifferent cellulosic pulps were provided by Renova. Premium recycled fibres (alpha-\n\nrecycled fibres), R, produced by Renova from paper wastes, collected in 30.10.2012 was \n\nsupplied for the studies. Additionally, bleached Eucalyptus Globulus industrial kraft pulp \n\n(purchased to Portucel Soporcel group, lot 35I-179025), E, was also supplied along with \n\nbleached softwood pulp (purchased to Botnia group, lot 4B21263), S, for comparative \n\nreasons.  \n\n3.2.1. Chemical characterization \n\nWhen received all cellulosic pulps were analysed according to its moisture content, \n\nash content, intrinsic viscosity, carbonyl and carboxyl contents and sugar composition. \n\n3.2.1.1. Moisture content \n\nThe moisture content from 1g of pulp was determined on an oven at 105\u00baC following \n\nnorm TAPPI T 412 om-11. \n\n3.2.1.2. Ash content \n\nFollowing procedure 3.2.1.1, the ash content was also determined at 525\u00b125\u00baC, in \n\nagreement with norm Tappi T 211 om-07. \n\n3.2.1.3. Extractives \n\n? Acetone (99.9%, HPLC grade, Acros Organics) \n\nThe extractives content, in pulp samples, was determined considering norm Tappi \n\nT204 om-88, using acetone as solvent.  \n\n3.2.1.4. Intrinsic viscosity \n\n? Cupper-ethylenediamine solution (CED, Panreac) \n\n? Distilled water \n\nIntrinsic viscosity was determined by dissolution of pulp samples in CED (cupper-\n\nethylenediamine) solution, according to norm SCAN-CM 15:88.  \n\n3.2.1.5. Carbonyl content \n\n? Chloride of 2,3,5-trifenil-2H-tetrazolium (98%, Sigma-Aldrich) \n\n? KOH (87%, Acros Organics) \n\n? Ethanol (99%, Acros Organics) \n\n? Glucose (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 86 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  \n \n\n? Distilled water \n\nThe carbonyl content was determined following procedures from literature.\n[17,18]\n\n The \n\nmethod is based on the ability of these groups to reduce the chloride of 2,3,5-trifenil-2H-\n\ntetrazolium (TTC), yielding a compound of red colour called formazan (Figure 3. 1), which \n\nis easily identified and quantified by UV-Vis spectroscopy. This method is known as the \n\nSabolks method. \n\n \n\nFigure 3. 1 \u2013 Reaction between TTC and carbonyl groups from cellulose. \n\nFor this test a solution A (0.2 M of KOH), a solution B (0.2% (w/w)) of TTC in \n\nethanol, glucose, a porous glass filter and a volumetric tube (10 mL) are required. \n\nInitially, 0.010 g (+0.0001 g) of each sample was weighted into a Soviril tube (5mL). \n\nLater 0.5 mL of solution A was added followed by 0.5 mL of solution B. The tube was \n\nthen closed and placed in boiling water for 2 min. Subsequently to the reaction, pulp \n\nshould exhibit a red coloured complexion. Afterwards, the tube was placed on ice to cool \n\ndown. The tube content was then filtered with a glass filter, with vacuum, as represented in \n\nFigure 3. 2 \n\n \n\nFigure 3. 2 \u2013 Image of the volumetric tube equipped with a glass filter used on the procedure. \n\nPulp still with red colour was washed with ethanol, continuously until the red colour \n\nvanished. This operation was performed with a glass rod and ethanol was added for \n\nwashing until the filtrate on the tube made a total volume of 10 mL. The solution was then \n\nanalysed by UV-Vis spectroscopy on a UV-mini-1240 apparatus from Shimadzu, at 546 \n\nnm using a 10 mm cell. At the same time, a blank experiment was also carried out, with a \n\nsimilar procedure, but without pulp. The blank was used as reference for all measurements. \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 87 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  \n\ni) Calibration curve \n\nThe concentration of aldehyde groups was determined considering a calibration \n\ncurve made with glucose as standard. To do so, a glucose solution was prepared (0.1% \n\n(w/w)) and 10, 25, 40 and 50 ?L of this solution was placed on 4 tubes. Then, to each tube, \n\n0.5 mL of Solution A and 0.5 mL of solution B were added. The mixture was then placed \n\nin boiling water for 2 min. Afterwards, each tube was cooled down on ice and ethanol was, \n\nthen, added until the total volume reached 10 mL. Finally, each solution was analysed by \n\nUV-Vis spectroscopy, in the same way as before. The calibration curve at the end related \n\nabsorbance with C=O weight (mg). \n\nConsidering the mass of carbonyls determined through the calibration curve, the \n\ncontent of carbonyls was determined for each sample according to Equation 3.1, where M \n\ncorrespond to C=O mass (mg) considering the calibration curve, and G is the mass of pulp \n\nweighted. \n\n? = ?

NaHCO3(97%, Fluka) \n\n? Distilled water \n\nThe amount of carboxyls was determined following an adaptation of norm T237 om-\n\n93. To do so, 2\u00b10.1 g of pulp was weighted and placed into a 500 mL erlenmeyer (in \n\nduplicate). Then 250 mL of HCl 0.1 M were added and the suspension was left stirring for \n\n4h, to insure that all carboxyl groups were in its protonated form. Afterwards, the pulp was \n\nfiltered and washed with water until the filtrate pH matched water pH. \n\nThe filtered pulp was weighted and added to 500 mL of NaHCO3 and NaCl solution \n\n(prepared by dissolving 0.84 g of NaHCO3 and 5.85 g de NaCl in 1 L of H2O). This \n\ndispersion was then left stirring during, at least, 12 h. Afterwards, the pulp was filtered \n\nagain under vacuum, while the filtrate was collected in a dry buchner flask. Two aliquots \n\nof this liquid were collected, 20 mL each, and placed into 100 mL erlenmeyers. To prepare \n\na blank test, 20 mL of the NaHCO3 and NaCl solution was pipetted into a 100 mL \n\nerlenmeyer. \n\nThe solution alkalinity was determined by titration with HCl 0.01 M with methyl red. \n\nThe amount of carboxyls in 100 g of dry pulp was determined according to Equation 3.2, \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 88 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  \n \n\nwhere a is the volume (mL) of 0.01 M HCl spent on titration, b, is the volume (mL) of 0.01 \n\nM HCl spent on the blank titration, G is the weight (g) of water in pulp after the titration, \n\nand w is the weight of the dry pulp (g).  \n\n????

NH3 (25%, Panreac) \n\n? 2-desoxiglucose (99%, Acros Organics) \n\n? NaBH4 (99%, Acros Organics) \n\n? Glacial acetic acid (99.7%, Fluka ) \n\n? 1-methylimidazol (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) \n\n? Acetic Anhydride (99%, Acros Organics) \n\n? Acetone (99.9%, HPLC grade, Acros Organics) \n\n? Distilled water \n\nIn order to determine the neutral sugar content, on each sample, the procedure \n\nfollowed three reaction steps, hydrolysis, reduction and acetylation.\n[19]\n\n \n\ni) Hydrolysis \n\nThe first step consisted on the samples hydrolysis. With that in mind, 10 mg of pulp \n\nwere weighted into a soviril tube (in duplicate). Into each tube, 400 ?L of H2SO4 (72%) \n\nwere added, followed by 3 h incubation at room temperature. Afterwards, 4.4 mL of \n\ndistilled water were added and the tubes were left to incubate at 100\u00baC for 2h30. Later the \n\ntubes were placed on ice to cool down. \n\nii) Reduction \n\nThe next step consisted on the reduction of sugars resultant from the hydrolysis step. \n\nTo do so 200 \u00b5L of 2-desoxiglucose (10 mg/mL) were added as internal standard, to each \n\ntube. Then 1 mL from this mixture was placed in a new tube, to which 0.2 mL of NH3 \n\n(25%) and 0.1 mL of NH3 (3 M) containing 150 mg/mL de NaBH4, were further added \n\n(while the tubes are still kept on ice). \n\nSamples were then left to incubate under 30 \u00baC during 1 h. Afterwards, all tubes were \n\nplaced again on ice, to cool down. To each tube, 50 \u00b5L of glacial acetic acid was added, \n\ntwice, followed by agitation, in order to destroy the excess of NaBH4. \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 89 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  \n\niii) Acetylation \n\nThe last reaction step consisted on the acetylation of the sugars reduced in the \n\nprevious step. To do so, 0.3 mL from each tube was poured into new tubes, followed by \n\nthe addition of 0.45 mL of 1-metthylhimidazol and 3 mL de acetic anhydride. \n\nSubsequently, the tubes were left to incubate for 30 min at 30 \u00baC and later placed on ice to \n\ncool down. \n\nWhen cooled down, 3.75 mL of distilled water (water excess to destroy the acetic \n\nanhydride) and 2.5 mL of dichloromethane (extraction of the alditol acetates) were added. \n\nThe mixture was agitated with a vortex apparatus and when phase separation was verified, \n\nwith a Pasteur pipette, the upper layer of liquid (aqueous phase) was removed. Then 3 mL \n\nof distilled water and 2 mL of dichloromethane were added and mixed again with the \n\nvortex apparatus. When phase separation was verified the upper layer liquid layer was \n\nremoved again (aqueous phase). The same procedure was repeated three times but without \n\nthe dichloromethane addition. After this procedure, the tubes content was placed under \n\nnitrogen flow for evaporation and, when dried, to the residue inside the tubes 1 mL of \n\nacetone was added. Then samples were once more placed under nitrogen flow for \n\nevaporation. This evaporation procedure was repeated one more time. \n\niv) Gas chromatography analysis \n\nThe residue resultant from the previous stage was dissolved in 100 \u00b5L of dry acetone \n\nand 1 \u00b5L of the resultant mixture was injected into a chromatographer Focus GC from \n\nThermo Scientific, with a Restek Corp column, RTX-225 (L=30 m; id=0.25 mm and \n\ndf=0.25 ?m) and FID detector, under the following conditions: injector temperature at 225 \n\n\u00baC, column temperature at 220 \u00baC e detector temperature at 250 \u00baC.  \n\nThe calibration curves determined for each standard were determined and are \n\nrepresented in Appendice A. \n\n3.2.1.8.

The main entry of this flask was meant for concentrated H2SO4, while \n\nthe other worked as an exit for the gas produced during the reaction (HCl). This output was \n\nlinked into a recipient, on ice, containing dry methanol (50 mL), followed by a second \n\nrecipient containing NaOH for neutralization of the residual HCl gases. The final solution \n\nof methanol and HCl was titrated to access the molar content of HCl, which was \n\ndetermined to be 1.8 M. \n\nAfter preparing the main reactant, the methanolysis procedure took place according \n\nto reference\n[20]\n\n. To do so, 4.5 mg of fibres were weighted and placed on a soviril tube, to \n\nwhich 2 mL of HCl (in methanol) were then added. Each sample was tested in duplicate. \n\nAfterwards, each tube was left to incubate for 4 h during 100 \u00baC.Then to each tube 80 ?L \n\nof pyridine and 1 mL of standard sorbitol solution 0.1 mg/mL (prepared with methanol) \n\nwas added to each tube). From each tube, 2 mL of the mixture was then removed, placed \n\non new tubes, and evaporated with N2. To the remaining dry residue 70 ?L of Pyridine, \n\n150 ?L of hexamethyldisiloxane and 80 ?L de trimethylchlorosilane were added. After 12 \n\nh at room temperature, the samples were analysed by GC-MS. The samples were analysed \n\nby a gas chromatographer Trace Gas Chromatograph 2000 series, equipped with a mass \n\ndetector from Thermo Scientific DSQII, using helium as carrier gas (35 cm/s). The \n\nchromatographic conditions were as follows: column capillary DB-1J&amp;W (30 m x 0.32 \n\nmm i.d.0.25 lm); initial temperature of the column 100 to 4 \u00baC/min 175 \u00baC following by \n\n175\u201312 C/min; final temperature 290 \u00baC, and detector temperature 290 \u00baC.  \n\n3.2.1.9. Determination of residual lignin and hexuronic acids amount \n\n? Cadmium oxide (99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) \n\n? Ethylenediamine (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) \n\n? Distilled water \n\nThe residual lignin content and the amount of hexuronic groups (HexA) were \n\ndetermined according with literature\n[3]\n\n, through UV-Vis spectroscopic analysis of samples \n\ndissolved in cadoxen. Cadoxen was prepared from ethylenediamine (EDA) aqueous \n\nsolution and cadmium oxide, following the same reference.\n[21] \n\nCadoxen is a solvent capable of dissolving pulp, with properties favourable to UV-\n\nVis spectroscopy, such as the absence of a visible band and transparency in the UV region. \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 91 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  \n\nWhen dissolved on cadoxen, polysaccharides exhibit great stability to oxidative \n\ndegradation, enabling thus the storage of such solutions for a long periods of time. These \n\nadvantages allow the quantification of lignin through UV spectroscopy, at 280 nm, on \n\nbleached and non-bleached pulp, dissolved in cadoxen. Cadoxen itself exhibits an \n\nabsorption and below 220 nm. However, the UV region above 220 nm can still be \n\nconsidered for analysis. \n\nBetween 230 and 350 nm, it is possible to identify the contribution of residual lignin \n\nand hexuronic groups from xylans. The absorption at 231nm is attributed to the \n\nhexenuronic groups. In the case of residual lignin this last exhibits an absorption band at \n\n280 nm, a shoulder between 240-255 nm and some absorption at 230 nm.  \n\nConsidering this the absorptions at 231nm and 280 nm of pulp solution in cadoxen \n\ncan be expressed by Equations 3.3 and 3.4, where ?231\n????, ?231\n\n???\n, ?280\n\n???? e ?280\n???\n\n are the \n\nabsorptivity\u2019s of the hexuronic groups (HexA) and of residual lignin (Lig), at its \n\ncharacteristic wavelengths 231nm and 280 nm.

With that in mind, 100 mg of each pulp were weighted and a 5 ton pressure was \n\napplied to each sample with a press. All pellets were analysed between 4 and 40 \u00ba of 2?(\u00ba) \n\nat 0.02 \u00ba/scan.

The spectra were registered on a \n\nBruker Avance 400 spectrometer. Samples were packed into a zirconia\u2019s rotor sealed with \n\nKel-FTM caps and spun at 9 kHz. Acquisition parameters were as follows: ca 7000 scans \n\nwith a 90 proton pulse, a cross-polarization contact time of 1 ms and a recovery delay of \n\n2.5 s.

Initially, both \n\nreplicas were dispersed under deuterated water, although while replica one was subjected \n\nto HP treatment (400 MPa, 15 min), replica two remained under D2O for 15 min (the same \n\namount of time required for the UHP treatment). It is noteworthy that both replicas were \n\ninitially dispersed with the sample consistency (2%) on D2O. Afterwards, all pulp samples \n\nwere filtered, allowed to hydrogenate under room conditions, then placed at 105 \u00baC to \n\nachieve complete dryness and then stored in a desiccator under P2O5. Pellets with pulp and \n\nKBR were then prepared, from each sample, (2 mg of pulp: 250 mg of KBR) for analysis \n\non a Bruker optics tensor 27, with 128 scans and with 4cm\n-1\n\n of resolution.

When completely dried, samples were attached to the top \n\nof closed flasks containing saturated salt solutions, and then placed in a water bath (Jubalo \n\nSW23) with controlled temperature. All samples were weighted periodically until \n\nequilibrium was reached (approximately 7 days). \n\nThe experimental data were then fitted to GAB (Guggenheim, Anderson and de \n\nBoer) model. The nonlinear regression analysis of the experimental data was performed \n\nusing Matlab r2012a curve fitting tool.

Results and Discussion \n\n3.3.1. Pulps characterization \n\nCellulosic pulps supplied by Renova, namely recycled fibres, R, bleached kraft E. \n\nglobulus pulp, E, and softwood pulp, S, were received and analysed for its composition \n\nand other general parameters. The results achieved are presented in Table 3. 2 and 3. 3, \n\nrespectively. \n\nPulps composition was accessed according to its sugar composition from its \n\nhemicelluloses. Recycled fibres, R, displayed a composition similar to that of hardwood \n\npulps, with high amounts of glucose and xylose, although very small amount of galactose \n\nand mannose were also detected. These residual sugar content could be easily explained by \n\nvariabilities on the feedstock used to produce recycled pulp, which consisted, mainly, of \n\nhardwood pulp products (e.g. office papers), along with residues of softwood pulp \n\nproducts. \n\nAs regards E, this displayed a typical composition of E. globulus hardwood pulp, as \n\ndescribed in the literature, with a high amount of glucose and xylose, due to the presence \n\nof glucuronoxylans (the most abundant hemicelluloses on this type of wood).\n[26]\n\n Whereas S \n\nexhibited a high content of glucose accompanied by a lower xylose content, with \n\nmonosaccharides such as mannose, galactose and arabinose, typical from softwood \n\npulps.\n[26]\n\n The second method (methanolysis) for sugar analysis, relatively to the first, \n\nenables the determination, exclusively, of hemicelluloses including uronic acid residues, \n\nwhich is not possible through the first method. For example, in the case of 4-O-Me-GlcA, \n\nthis compound is easily found on hardwood pulps (O-Acetyl-4-O-methylglucuronoxylans, \n\ntypical hardwood xylan). \n\nTable 3. 2 \u2013 Composition of neutral sugars %(w/w) of R, E and S cellulosic pulps. \n\n \nR % (w/w) E % (w/w) S % (w/w)  R % (w/w) E % (w/w) S % (w/w) \n\nNeutral Sugars analysis by Saeman hydrolysis Monosaccharides and uronic acids by methanolysis \n\nGlc 78.8\u00b12.2 75.4\u00b12.3 85.1\u00b11.5 Glc 43.8\u00b11.1 34.7\u00b10.4 50.6\u00b11.7 \n\nXyl 17.7\u00b12.3 24.6\u00b12.5 9.2\u00b11.4 Xyl 43.5\u00b12.4 62.6\u00b10.2 26.0\u00b11.4 \n\nAra 0.5\u00b10.1 Trace 0.7\u00b10.1 Ara 0.6\u00b10.3 0.0\u00b10.0 1.5\u00b10.07 \n\nMan 2.8\u00b10.1 Trace 4.9\u00b10.7 GalA 0.3\u00b10.03 0.4\u00b10.08 0.08\u00b10.04 \n\nGal 0.2\u00b10.1 Trace 0.1\u00b10.04 4-O-Me-GlcA 0.8\u00b10.08 0.8\u00b10.04 0.0\u00b10.0 \n\n  Gal 9.8\u00b10.9 0.8\u00b10.05 20.9\u00b10.19 \n\n    Man 1.2\u00b10.05 0.7\u00b10.08 0.9\u00b10.09 \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 98 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  \n \n\nOther general parameters were also investigated such as the ash content, intrinsic \n\nviscosity, extractives, residual lignin, hexenuronic acids, carbonyls and carboxyls content, \n\nand these results are displayed in Table 3. 3. \n\nTable 3. 3- Results of chemical analysis of R, E and S. \n\n \nR E S \n\nAsh content (%) 1.83\u00b10.05 0.14\u00b10.02 0.07\u00b10.04 \n\nExtractives (in acetone) (%) 0.15\u00b10.01 0.24\u00b10.02 0.13\u00b10.01 \n\nIntrinsic viscosity (mL/g) 540\u00b110 925\u00b11.0 610\u00b15.0 \n\nCarbonyls (mmol/100g pulp) 1.26\u00b10.07 0.76\u00b10.03 0.97\u00b10.1 \n\nCarboxyls (mmol/100g pulp) 7.0\u00b10.1 6.80\u00b10.3 4.0\u00b10.3 \n\nResidual Lignin (%) - 0.11\u00b10.01 0.18\u00b10.01 \n\nHexenuronic acids (mmol/kg) - 5.2\u00b10.02 10.0\u00b10.02 \n\nRecycled fibres, R, exhibited a high amount of ash, which is agreement with the \n\npresence of inorganic impurities, such as fillers. These results are indicative that recycled \n\nfibres still possess impurities (acquired during its life cycle) that were not possible to \n\nremove completely, even after the purification process.\n[2]\n\n On the other hand, virgin pulps \n\n(E and S), as expected from bleached virgin pulps, exhibited a low ash content, which is \n\natributed to the multiple washing stages they were subjected during its production.\n[27,28]\n\n \n\nThe intrinsic viscosity parameter was also evaluated. In the case of R, the registered \n\nlow intrinsic viscosity suggests fibre degradation (cellulose depolymerization during fibres \n\nlife cycle).\n[2]\n\n At the same time, virgin fibres (E and S) exhibited typical values.\n[27]\n\n \n\nAlthough in the case of S, viscosity could be affected by a severe pulping process, thus \n\nproducing lower polymerization degrees, which affected intrinsic viscosity. \n[27]\n\n  \n\nThe carbonyl content displayed the highest value for R, suggesting the eventual \n\npresence of chromophore structures in recycled fibres, most likely due to organic \n\nimpurities or due to the fibres ageing.\n[2]\n\n On the other hand, E and S exhibited a lower \n\ncarbonyl content, which is in agreement with virgin bleached pulps.  \n\nResidual lignin and hexenuronic acids (HexA) content were also determined.\n[21]\n\n \n\nResults were achieved for both virgin pulp, E and S, however, for R the same was not \n\npossible by this method. A possible explanation would be the interference of R impurities \n\non the procedure, which relies on spectroscopic analysis of cadoxen-dissolved pulp. \n\nThe determined values registered a similar and low residual lignin content in the \n\nstudied pulps. In addition, S exhibited a higher amount of HexA than E. This difference \n\ncould be attributed to a harsher cooking procedure suffered by S, when compared to E, and \n\na predominant TCF bleaching of S pulp.\n[27,28]\n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 99 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  \n\n3.3.2. Structural changes upon UHP treatment \n\nSamples R, E and S, were subjected to UHP treatment at 400 MPa during 15 min. \n\nThese conditions were selected based on work previously performed.\n[14\u201316]\n\n For simplicity, \n\neach sample treated with UHP will be labelled as RHP, EHP, and SHP, respectively. \n\nStructural changes induced by UHP on fibres were followed by various techniques, \n\nsuch as XRD, NMR, FTIR of deuterated samples, zeta potential and SEM analysis. \n\nAdditionally, the effects of UHP treatment on pulps hydration abilities were also accessed \n\nthrough capillary rise tests, contact angle analysis (a measure of wettability), moisture \n\nsorption isotherms and calorimetric analysis along with thermal analysis (TGA/DSC). \n\n3.3.2.1. XRD and NMR \n\nStructural changes on cellulosic fibres were accessed through XRD and \n13\n\nC RMN, \n\nboth on UHP treated and non-treated pulp samples. XRD data enabled the determination of \n\nthe crystallinity degree (CD), and unit cell parameters, D200 (average crystallite width from \n\nplane 200) and b (average height of cellulosic crystalline cell). Table 3. 4 display the \n\nresults achieved for all UHP treated (RHP, EHP and SHP) and non-treated samples (R, E \n\nand S). When comparing treated with non-treated samples, overall UHP samples revealed a \n\nhigher average crystallite size, D200, up to ca. 16%. Besides, its CD also exhibited an \n\nincrease, when comparing with non-treated samples, with exception of the pair S and SHP.  \n\nThese changes mentioned above, have already been demonstrated previously, \n[16]\n\n \n\nwhere it was showed that UHP treatment induces rearrangements on cellulosic fibres \n\nstructure were suggested, leading towards the convergence of conveniently orientated \n\ncrystallites, and thus larger crystallites (co-crystallization). Moreover, the rearrangements \n\ninduced by UHP also could produce chain rearrangements on paracrystalline regions \n\nyielding, more crystalline material on the surface, and thus higher CD.\n[16]\n\n \n\nTable 3. 4 \u2013 Cellulose parameters obtained by XRD analysis. \n\nSamples 2?002 (\u00ba) 2?040 (\u00ba) D002 (nm) b (nm)  CD (%) \n\nR 22.5 34.5 4.5 1.03  70.9 \n\nRHP 22.5 34.6 5.2 1.03  71.5 \n\nE 22.5 34.6 5.0 1.03  71.1 \n\nEHP 22.5 34.6 5.6 1.03  71.7 \n\nS 22.6 34.6 6.0 1.03  75.2 \n\nSHP 22.6 34.6 6.3 1.03  74.7 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 100 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  \n \n\nTable 3. 5 \u2013 Crystallinity index determined by \n13\n\nC NMR. \n\nSample \n13\n\nC NMR, Crystallinity index (%) \n\nR 46.5 \n\nRHP 48.2 \n\nE 45.4 \n\nEHP 46.0 \n\nS 50.5 \n\nSHP 51.0 \n\nChanges in fibres structure were also followed by \n13\n\nC solid-state NMR (Appendices \n\nB).

This \n\nparameter was determined considering the ratio between the area of ordered (A86ppm-92ppm) \n\nand amorphous (A79-86ppm) regions.\n[23]\n\n These results are presented in Table 3. 5 and from \n\nthe results obtained, it was possible to observe that UHP treated samples revealed higher \n\ncrystallinity index when compared with non-treated samples. These results further support \n\nXRD results, as concerns the changes suffered by fibres on its crystalline regions,\n[16]\n\n and \n\nallows to confirm the possibility of method error in case of XRD data, for samples pair S \n\nand SHP. Additionally, the presented results suggest that R, E and S, upon UHP treatment, \n\nexhibit similar behaviour not differing much from each other. \n\n3.3.2.2. FTIR of deuterated samples \n\nStructural changes on fibres along with the presence of strongly bound water, as \n\nresult of UHP treatment, were investigated by FTIR of pulp samples subjected to H/D \n\nexchange with heavy water, in liquid phase, as described in section 3.2.6. The spectra of \n\nsamples were normalized according to 2900cm\n-1\n\n band (C\u2013H stretching vibration) and are \n\nrepresented in Figures 3.3 and 3.4. \n\n \n\nFigure 3. 3- Normalized FTIR spectra of deuterated samples R and RHP. \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 101 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  \n\n  \n\n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 3. 4 \u2013 Normalized FTIR of deuterated samples E and EHP, a); and S with SHP b). \n\nThe spectra of recycled fibres, with and without UHP, (RHP and R, respectively) in \n\nFigure 3. 3, display the typical OD band\n[29\u201331]\n\n at 2494cm\n-1\n\nfor RHP, while R did not show \n\nthis band. The presence of absorbance at approximately 2500cm\n-1\n\n in RHP spectra suggests \n\nthat either OD groups were not able to perform the exchange from OD to OH, due to \n\nstructural changes, or, considering the effects induced by UHP (structural rearrangements, \n\nincreased accessibility, forced hydration, etc).\n[16]\n\n D2O entered deep inside the fibre \n\nstructure, into previously inaccessible sites, remaining imprisoned under the form of \n\nstrongly bound water (not leaving even at 105\u00baC). Additionally, the OH band shift from \n\n3445cm\n-1\n\n to 3387cm\n-1\n\n, into smaller wavelengths, also suggests thus, since it entails more \n\nintensive OH bonds. \n\nAs regards virgin fibres FTIR spectra showed some different results (Figure 3. 4). \n\nUpon UHP, hardwood (EHP) and softwood fibres (SHP), both revealed an intense peak at \n\n2488cm\n-1\n\nand at 2489 cm\n-1\n\n, respectively (OD band). These peaks were accompanied by \n\nshoulders at smaller wavelengths. Nevertheless, E and S, in opposite to recycled fibres, \n\nexhibited a smaller, but still well detectable, peak at ca 2940 cm\n-1 \n\nand 2943cm\n-1\n\n, \n\nrespectively (even after drying of non-pressurized pulps). Although, it is noteworthy that \n\nthe OD peak intensity of EHP and SHP was much more expressive than that on RHP.  \n\nSince recycled fibres (hornified fibres) exhibit a collapsed structure, lower \n\nmacroporosity and hindered accessibility, the penetration of D2O on these fibres is \n\nprobably more difficult than on virgin fibres (less collapsed structure with higher \n\nmacroporosity). Therefore, it is possible that these facts contribute for the higher D2O \n\npenetration and retention on virgin fibres, comparatively to recycled ones, even upon UHP. \n\nThe fact that virgin UHP untreated pulps still exhibited a visible OD band, could be \n\nexplained by irreversible changes suffered by virgin fibres during the drying process, \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 102 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  \n \n\nwhich hindered the H/D exchange (resistant OD). Hence, it is possible that the same was \n\nnot observed for recycled fibres, R, for the above mentioned reasons (hornified fibres with \n\nlow porosity). It is also noteworthy that, deuteration in most cases is not completely \n\nreversible if structural alterations take place on virgin fibres, due to drying (hornification), \n\nthe exchange from deuterium to hydrogen becomes more unlikely.\n[29\u201332]\n\n Moreover, the \n\nshift observed from R to RHP, on the OH band, suggests the possibility of shorter distance \n\nand more intensive interactions between polymer molecules and water (forced hydration), \n\nafter the UHP treatment. The hypothesis of water imprisonment by UHP treatment and \n\nother of its effects is on a scheme presented in Figure 3. 5. \n\n \n\nFigure 3. 5\u2013 Schematic representation of the phenomena behind UHP treatment (adaptated from Scallan microfibril \n\ndrying scheme \n[11,33,34]\n\n). \n\n3.3.2.3. Zeta Potential \n\nThe effects induced by UHP on fibres were further analysed by zeta potential \n\nmeasurements (Table 3. 6). As expected for cellulosic material all samples exhibited \n\nnegative charges.\n[35]\n\n This occurs because when a charged surface is immersed in a solution \n\ncontaining ions, an electrical double layer is formed (Figure 3. 6). In the case of cellulose \n\n(negatively charged), the sources behind its charge could be related with the dissociation of \n\nionic groups on the particle surface (e.g. COOH groups of cellulose). The negatively \n\ncharged surface (Figure 3. 6) attracts oppositely charged ions (counter-ions) and repels \n\nions of the same charge (co-ions). If it were possible to separate the two-phase, they would \n\ncarry equals and opposite charges.\n[35]\n\n \n\nCellulose is negatively charged throughout a wide pH window and depending on the \n\ncellulose origin its zeta potential approaches zero between 4-5.\n[36,37]\n\n The ionisable groups \n\nUHP \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 103 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  \n\non cellulosic fibres may be carboxyl groups, hemiacetal, sulfonic acid groups, phenolic \n\ngroups among some others. Under normal papermaking conditions, the carboxyl and \n\nsulfonic acid groups are the major contributors to fibre charge. Most of the carboxyl \n\ngroups originate, either from non-cellulosic components in wood itself or are created \n\nduring the pulping and bleaching operations. Sulfonic acid groups are introduced with \n\nsulfite treatment during CTMP or chemical pulping.\n[35]\n\n  \n\n \n\nFigure 3. 6 \u2013 The electrostatic double layer on the surface of a material.\n[38]\n\n \n\nAlthough negatively charged, UHP treated samples exhibited lower negative zeta \n\npotential charges than untreated ones. These results suggested the diminishing of surface \n\npotential (?0) or the increasing of the Stern layer. As cellulosic pulp was not subjected to a \n\nradical chemical or physical modification with a drastic change of its structure, the changes \n\nin ?0 are very unlikely. Most likely, the forced hydration led to the diminishing of the \n\nsurface conductivity of cellulose material, due to the delocalization of its negative charge, \n\nthus increasing the Stern layer. \n\nFrom a papermaking point of view, the decrease of pulps zeta potential, upon UHP \n\ntreatment, could be considered a positive point, since it may contribute, for example, to \n\ndecrease the demand on retention aids to facilitate paper formation. \n\nTable 3. 6\u2013 Zeta potential measurement and its pHs values, of pulp samples treated with and without UHP. \n\nSample Zeta potential (mV) pH \n\nR -19.5\u00b17.2 5.55 \n\nRHP -2.5\u00b14.4 5.53 \n\nE -15.4\u00b13.5 5.93 \n\nEHP -9.9\u00b15.6 5.69 \n\nS -30.1\u00b16.8 5.61 \n\nSHP -20.4\u00b15.9 5.63 \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 104 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  \n \n\n3.3.2.4. SEM \n\nThe morphology of UHP treated (RHP, EHP and SHP) and non-treated (R, E and S) \n\nsamples was also accessed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Recycled fibres \n\nare represented in Figure 3. 7 (R and RHP), while virgin fibres images are represented in \n\nFigure 3. 8 (E and EHP), and in Figure 3. 9 (for S and SHP). Overall, it was possible to \n\nobserve, on the surface of treated fibres, an increase on surface irregularity. It was \n\nsuggested that macrofibrils upon UHP \u201cswelled\u201d, standing out more than before. These \n\ngains in bulk and surface roughness are in agreement with fibril disaggregation and forced \n\nhydration, especially, forced hydration. Similar features have been observed for cellulosic \n\nfibres, in literature, using a optic microscopic imaging. \n[16]\n\n Therefore it explains the \n\nbulkiness gained by macrofibrils, and thus its higher exposure on the surface. \n\n \nFigure 3. 7- SEM images of R (a) and RHP (b and c). \n\n \nFigure 3. 8-SEM images of E (a) and EHP (b,c and d). \n\n \nFigure 3. 9\u2013 SEM images of S (a) and SHP (b). \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 105 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  \n\n3.3.3. Interactions between fibres and water upon UHP treatment \n\nThe affinity between fibres and water plays a key role in tissue paper industry. \n\nTherefore, this point was of special attention in order to better comprehend how UHP \n\naffects fibres. This was critical for recycled fibres due to their hard hornification. With this \n\nin mind, water affinity in samples, with and without UHP treatment, were investigated, \n\nregarding its affinity towards water using capillary rise tests, contact angle measurements, \n\nmoisture sorption isotherms, thermal and calorimetric analyses. \n\n3.3.3.1. Capillary rise tests \n\nThe contribution of UHP towards fibres affinity to water uptake was investigated by \n\ncapillary rise tests and its results are displayed in Table 3. 7. It was found that upon UHP \n\n(RHP, EHP, SHP), samples revealed higher capillary rise when compared with non-\n\ntreated samples (R, E, S). Recycled fibres registered an increase of ca. 11% from R to \n\nRHP, while virgin fibres displayed an increase of ca. 3.5 % from E to EHP, and of 19% \n\nfrom S to SHP. These findings evidenced that UHP promoted fibres accessibility towards \n\nwater due to the fibril disaggregation and thus contributed to the decrease of \n\nhornification,\n[15,16]\n\n negatively affecting recycled fibres. These effects originated not only \n\nfrom extra free OH groups (previously unavailable) but also from a less collapsed structure \n\nof cellulosic fibres and improved macroporous structure in pulp sheets, i.e. for an easier \n\nascension of water molecules through fibres.  \n\nThe UHP treatment effects were particularly strong on recycled fibres (R and RHP) \n\nand on softwood virgin fibres (S and SHP). In the case of recycled fibres due to \n\nhornification, its structure is collapsed, with low porosity and poor accessibility to free OH \n\ngroups. Upon UHP treatment, the rearrangements and fibril disaggregation provoked by \n\nthis treatment, originate improved accessibility to inner fibre layers and to more free OH \n\ngroups. Since recycled fibres display more limited hydration skill, due to the \n\naforementioned reasons, this may explain why its results were better than those of its \n\nhomologous, hardwood pulp. In the case of softwood fibres (S and SHP), these were the \n\nones displaying the highest increase in the capillary rise. Although being \u201cdried\u201d virgin \n\nfibres, it is possible that its structure, in terms of porosity and accessibility to OH groups, \n\nwere somehow jeopardized. This may be true if during its production harsh conditions \n\nwere used. Therefore, although being \u201cvirgin fibres\u201d its full potential is not available. As \n\nresult, upon UHP treatment, it is possible that UHP reversed the aforementioned \n\nlimitations enabling a substantial improvement of softwood fibres capillarity.   \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 106 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  \n \n\nTable 3. 7\u2013 Capillary rise of UHP treated (RHP, EHP and SHP) and non-treated samples (R, E and S). \n\nSample \nTime  \n\n(min) \n\nCapillary rise \n\n(mm) \n\nR 10 49.5 \u00b1 0.25 \n\nRHP 10 55.0 \u00b1 0.25 \n\nE 10 125.5 \u00b1 0.25 \n\nEHP 10 130.0 \u00b1 0.50 \n\nS 10 105.5 \u00b1 0.25 \n\nSHP 10 125.5 \u00b1 0.70 \n\n3.3.3.2. Contact angle analysis \n\nCellulosic fibres wettability was also investigated by contact angle (CA) \n\nmeasurements, with different liquids of known contribution of polar and apolar energy \n\n(water, formamide and diiodomethane). These tests have been performed from cuts of \n\nhandsheets prepared from each sample. CA results were also corrected (Table 3. 8) \n\nconsidering the surface roughness of samples (Table 3. 9), using the Wenzel equation. \n[39\u2013\n\n41]\n \n\nAs regards recycled fibres, samples treated with UHP (RHP) revealed a slight \n\nincrease of CA with water, when compared with untreated samples, which is indicative of \n\na slight decrease on wettability. From CA results, surface free energy was also determined, \n\naccording to Owen-Wendt relationship.\n[24]\n\n The obtained results showed a small decrease of \n\nthe surface free energy, from untreated to UHP-treated recycled fibres (from R to RHP), \n\nwith slight variations on its polar (decrease) and dispersive (increase) contributions. It is \n\npossible that this slight decrease on hydrophilicity could be related with a redistribution of \n\nhydrophobic impurities in recycled fibres, during UHP treatment. However, the small \n\nvariations registered and its deviations (between non-treated and UHP-treated samples), \n\nsuggest that further studies, with other techniques, are required to evaluate more correctly \n\nthe effect of UHP treatment on recycled fibres hydrophilicity. \n\nIn the case of hardwood virgin fibres, CA with water decreased, in samples subjected \n\nto UHP treatment (ca. 10% from E to EHP). This result is indicative of an improvement on \n\nthe handsheets wettability.\n[42]\n\n Additionally, the surface energy results revealed an increase \n\nin samples treated with UHP, comparatively to untreated samples, with variations on its \n\npolar (increase) and dispersive (decrease) contributions. The increase in the surface energy, \n\nespecially of its polar contribution, confirms the improvement of this pulp hydrophilicity, \n\nafter the UHP treatment. This fact may be related to the increased amount of free OH \n\ngroups in pulps that appeared with the disaggregation of fibrils. Besides, fibres \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 107 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  \n\nmacroporosity also plays an important role. Thus, it is possible that the capacity of UHP to \n\nimprove porosity also contributes to an improved wettability. \n\nSimilar to recycled fibres, softwood virgin fibres also revealed ambiguous results, \n\nwith no significant variations of CA and of its surface energy and its respective \n\ncontributions. It is possible that the type of fibres (softwood, long fibres) is responsible for \n\nthe different impact of UHP treatment on fibres, comparatively to hardwood virgin fibres \n\n(short fibres). However, further studies with other techniques are required to scrutinize the \n\neffect of UHP treatment on the hydrophilicity of softwood virgin fibres. \n\nTable 3. 8\u2013 Contact angle (CA) and surface energy values for treated (RHP, EHP and SHP) and untreated pulps (R, E \n\nand S). \n\nSample \nContact angle (\u00ba)* Surface \n\nenergy \n\n(mJ/m\n2\n) \n\nPolar \n\n(mJ/m\n2\n) \n\nDispersive \n\n(mJ/m\n2\n) Water Formamide Diiodomethane \n\nR 54.4\u00b11.1 51.1\u00b10.3 66.5\u00b10.9 45.1\u00b14.3 30.7\u00b12.5 14.4\u00b11.7 \n\nRHP 58.7\u00b11.3 49.9\u00b10.9 60.7\u00b11.4 42.5\u00b13.7 24.1\u00b12.0 18.4\u00b11.7 \n\nE 65.2\u00b11.5 47.7\u00b10.8 63.7\u00b11.3 39.0\u00b15.6 19.2\u00b12.8 19.8\u00b12.8 \n\nEHP 58.8\u00b11.3 53.7\u00b10.9 62.2\u00b11.2 41.7\u00b15.9 24.8\u00b13.3 16.9\u00b12.7 \n\nS 58.3\u00b11.1 51.0\u00b10.7 61.9\u00b11.0 42.5\u00b14.0 25.0\u00b12.2 17.5\u00b11.8 \n\nSHP 59.2\u00b11.3 50.1\u00b11.5 64.0\u00b11.8 42.0\u00b13.1 24.9\u00b11.7 17.1\u00b11.4 \n\n             *All contact angles were corrected according to Wenzel equation \n[39\u201341]\n\n. \n\nTable 3. 9\u2013 Surface texture parameters from handsheets prepared from R, RHP, E, EHP, S and SHP. \n\nSample Average roughness(?m) Sdr (%) \n\nR 4.1\u00b10.1 23.8\u00b12.0 \n\nRHP 4.5\u00b10.03 29.5\u00b10.6 \n\nE 4.4\u00b10.05 38.4\u00b10.6 \n\nEHP 4.6\u00b10.1 40.9\u00b12.0 \n\nS 5.4\u00b10.2 34.5\u00b12.6 \n\nSHP 5.9\u00b10.2 41.5\u00b11.7 \n\n*Sdr (developed interfacial area ratio, % of surface area increase by \n\nthe contribution of texture comparatively to plane surface) Sdr= 0: \n\nplane surface; Sdr ?0: surface with texture (> Sdr ? surface with \n\nmore texture). \n\nTable 3.9 shows that samples prepared from fibres subjected to UHP treatment \n\n(RHP, EHP and SHP) exhibited higher roughness, comparatively to untreated fibres.  \n\nThe wetting behaviour of materials is governed by both their chemical composition \n\nand its geometric surface structure. Accordingly, an increase in roughness, on a \n\nhydrophobic/hydrophilic surface, results in more interfacial area, for interaction between \n\nsurface and liquid. Therefore increasing roughness may originate a material more \n\nhydrophobic/hydrophilic.\n[39,43]\n\n In the case of the three pulps under study, when pre-treated \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 108 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  \n \n\nwith UHP, the roughness of the handsheets prepared was higher, comparatively to those \n\nprepared from untreated pulps. However, only hardwood virgin fibres revealed a rather \n\nsignificant variation on wettability. Hardwood virgin fibres (from E to EHP) \n\nhydrophilicity and the increase in roughness may explain the decrease of CA with water \n\nand the variations in surface energy. However, the same may not be valid for softwood \n\nvirgin fibres and recycled fibres. Hence, it is noteworthy the necessity of complementary \n\ntests to scrutinize more correctly fibres hydration behaviour upon UHP. \n\n3.3.3.3. Moisture sorption isotherms  \n\nMoisture sorption isotherms are widely used to evaluate materials hydration \n\nmechanisms. With this in mind, this method was employed to investigate the changes \n\nresulting from UHP treatment on cellulosic fibres. Thus, samples treated (RHP, EHP and \n\nSHP) and not treated by UHP (R, E and S) were scrutinized for its moisture sorption \n\nisotherms at 25, 30 and 35 \u00baC. The results achieved are represented in Figures 3.10 and \n\n3.11. \n\n \n(a) \n\n  \n(b) (c) \n\nFigure 3. 10 - Moisture sorption isotherms at 25, 30 and 35 \u00baC for recycled fibres treated (RHP) and non-\n\ntreated (R) by UHP. \n\nThe moisture sorption isotherms determined for R and RHP evidenced a rather \n\nsignificant difference, from each other, in the studied temperature range. The changes were \n\nquite evident, since RHP exhibited improved moisture sorption, describing a pattern closer \n\nto that of virgin fibres (type II isotherm according with de Brunauer classification\n[44]\n\n), with \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 109 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  \n\nmonolayer formation. In opposite, R exhibited a quite limited moisture uptake, as \n\nconsequence of hornification, with insignificant monolayer formation (at all studied \n\ntemperatures). In contrast to RHP, R behaviour was much similar to that of a type III \n\nisotherm, typical for hydrophobic materials.\n[45]\n\n  \n\nThe sorption isotherm changes found from R to RHP can be explained by the effects, \n\npreviously discussed, induced by UHP treatment. UHP enabled structural rearrangements, \n\nat fibrils level (i.e. decrease of fibril aggregation and pore/fibres collapse), which \n\ncontributed to a significant increase of accessible surface with free OH groups. As a \n\nconsequence, the limitations on water sorption by hornified recycled fibres decreased \n\nsubstantially, after the UHP treatment.\n[14\u201316]\n\n  \n\nEven though recycled fibres (R) are known to be highly hornified, damaged, \n\ncontaminated with impurities, and possibly with chemical modifications\n[2]\n\n, hornification is \n\nstill considered the main responsible for its limited accessibility to free OH groups and thus \n\nits limited water sorption. Nevertheless, the already mentioned effects, induced by UHP, \n\ncontributed significantly to improve recycled fibres water sorption, which for tissue paper \n\nconsists in a rather relevant issue.  \n\nIn the case of virgin fibres (E, EHP, S, and SHP, Figure 3. 11), when compared to \n\nrecycled ones (R and RHP) a different trend in water sorption was observed. Although \n\nvirgin fibres described the typical type II isotherm behaviour \n[45,46]\n\n, when treated with UHP \n\n(EHP and SHP), a small decrease in its moisture sorption capacity, Xeq, was registered, at \n\nall studied temperatures. \n\nIn virgin fibres, the fibrils aggregation is much less expressed than in recycled fibres. \n\nHence, the decrease found could be related to the effect of forced hydration, i.e. the \n\npresence of significant amounts of strongly bound water, enough to diminish free OH \n\ngroups and hinder water molecules absorption to form the monolayer. It has been \n\ndemonstrated\n[16]\n\n before, and confirmed by results of the present study, that UHP is able to \n\ndecrease aggregation, improve accessibility and to introduce strongly bound water in \n\nfibres. It may be proposed two competing processes upon UHP treatment of pulp. One is \n\nrelated to the appearance of new accessible cellulosic surface free OH, due to fibrils \n\ndisaggregation and another is the formation of cellulosic clathrate hydrates (Figure 3. 12), \n\nwhere part of free OH groups is involved in strong interactions with water (less free OH). \n\nIn the case of virgin fibres, with relatively high accessible surface, the second process is \n\npredominating, whereas, for recycled fibres, the first one is the most important. This \n\nproposition is supported by the results of H/D exchange on virgin and recycled pulps. \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 110 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  \n \n\nThus, the amount of strongly bound D2O in virgin pulps was much superior than in \n\nrecycled pulps (Figures 3.3 and 3.4) \n\n \n\n  \n(a) (b) \n\n  \n(c) (d) \n\n  \n(e) (f) \n\nFigure 3. 11- Moisture sorption isotherms at 25, 30 and 35 \u00baC for virgin pulps treated with UHP (EHP and SHP) and \n\nnon-treated (E and S). \n\n \n\nFigure 3. 12 \u2013 Illustration of a possible clathrate hydrate formation. Free OH groups are involved in strong hydrogen \n\nbonding with water becoming \u201cfrozen\u201d. \n\nThe experimental data was also fitted considering models with physical meaning, \n\nwidely employed in the study of these type of systems, such as BET and GAB models. \n\nHowever, here will only be considered GAB model, which is less limiting, more versatile \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 111 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  \n\nand widely used with positive results describing moisture sorption on cellulosic \n\nmaterials.\n[45,46]\n\n \n\nThe fittings were performed on Matlab2012a, on its curve fitting tool. The adequacy \n\nof the fitting was evaluated considering the values devolved by Matlab of R\n2\n (coefficient of \n\ndetermination) and RMSE (root mean squared error). GAB parameters were determined by \n\nnon-linear regression analysis. The sorbents specific area was also determined in \n\nagreement with Equation 2.2 from Chapter 2, section 2.1.6.1. The results achieved are \n\ngiven in Table 3. 10 - 3.12. \n\nGAB parameters were estimated and analysed for R and RHP (Figure 3. 10). The \n\nestimated monolayer, Xm, for R displayed quite high values, which do not agree with the \n\nobservable pattern followed by the isotherm, with no significant monolayer. The fact that \n\nGAB model estimated a rather high value for the monolayer, suggests that the model was \n\nnot able to predict this parameter correctly. It is noteworthy that the aforementioned model \n\nis mostly used to describe type II isotherms (with monolayer formation), which may \n\nexplain its difficulty estimating a more accurate value. \n\nTable 3. 10 - Fitting and GAB parameters achieved from R and RHP non-linear regression, with confidence intervals of \n\n95%. \n\nParameters \nR RHP \n\nGAB (25\u00baC) GAB (30\u00baC) GAB (35\u00baC) GAB (25\u00baC) GAB (30\u00baC) GAB (35\u00baC) \n\nR\n2\n 0.9992 0.9986 0.9997 0.9994 0.9998 0.990 \n\nRMSE 6.5E-4 7.8E-4 3.1E-4 5.1E-4 6.2E-4 5.5E-4 \n\nC 4.7\u00b11.32 2.3\u00b11.5 1.3\u00b10.9 94.9\u00b154.4 50.4\u00b123.8 16.6\u00b14.7 \n\nXm 0.0322\u00b10.007 0.0407\u00b10.03 0.0466\u00b10.04 0.0253\u00b10.001 0.0226\u00b10.002 0.0199\u00b10.002 \n\nk 0.7830\u00b10.1 0.6975\u00b10.2 0.6925\u00b10.2 0.8431\u00b10.03 0.8633\u00b10.04 0.8865\u00b10.05 \n\nS(m\n2\n/g) 134.62 170.167 194.9 105.6 94.4 83.0 \n\n?Hc (kJ/mol) 98.3 133.1 \n\n?Hk (kJ/mol) 9.4 -3.8 \n\nC0 2.8E-17 4.9E-22 \n\nk0 2.0E-2 3.95 \n\n?Hs,t(kJ/mol) 88.9 136.9 \n\nNevertheless, in the case of RHP, since it behaves as a type II isotherm, with \n\nmonolayer formation, a more correct estimate of the monolayer was possible. It also \n\nrevealed, as expected, a decreasing monolayer with temperature.\n[47,48]\n\n The monolayer \n\nformation on RHP is a sign of the decrease on fibres hornification (more free OH groups \n\nfor the formation of the first layer of water molecules). The specific surface area was also \n\ndetermined, however, a comparison between R and RHP was not possible, due to its direct \n\ndependence with Xm, which was despised due the aforementioned reasons.  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 112 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  \n \n\nParameter C and k were also estimated. While the first parameter is related to the \n\nstrength of binding in the monolayer, the other is indicative of the organization of the \n\nmultilayer.\n[49]\n\n The values determined for C, as expected, decreased on both R and RHP \n\nwith temperature. However, when comparing R with RHP values an increase was found, \n\nwhich is in agreement with the formation of the monolayer in RHP. The formation of the \n\nmonolayer led to intensive interactions between cellulose free OH groups with water, \n\ncorresponding to a higher enthalpy of hydration. \n\nThe estimates of parameter k displayed a decrease in R, and an increase for RHP, \n\nwith increasing temperature. This parameter correlates water molecules properties from \n\nmultilayer and bulk water. As k approaches 1, little is the distinction between multilayer \n\nmolecules and liquid ones. In the case of R sample, due to its lacking of free OH groups to \n\nform the monolayer, the multilayer gains increasing significance and thus its contribution \n\nplays a bigger role on water sorption, comparatively to the monolayer, with increasing \n\ntemperature. On the other hand, since RHP is able to form a monolayer, in terms of water \n\nsorption, with increasing temperature, the multilayer loses importance. Its values increase \n\ntowards one suggest that the properties of the water molecules multilayer tend to those of \n\nbulk water, with increasing temperature.\n[49]\n\n \n\nWhen comparing the values of k for R and RHP, it was observed that the values from \n\nthe first were lower than those estimated for the second. This suggests that in RHP, the \n\ncontribution of the multilayer for water sorption is less significant, as previously \n\nmentioned, due to the formation of the monolayer, where more intensive interactions \n\nbetween cellulose and water molecules have a higher contribution. \n\nFrom the temperature dependence of parameters C and k, it was also possible to \n\ndetermine C0, k0 and ?Hc and ?Hk (Equations 2.3 and 2.4 from Chapter 2, section \n\n2.1.6.1.). Parameters C0 and k0 are entropic in nature and, similarly to C and k, one is \n\nrelated with the monolayer, while the other is related with the multilayer. C0 values are \n\nexpected to be smaller than 1 (molecules prefer the multilayer than the monolayer from an \n\nentropic point of view), while k0 values are expected to be higher than 1 (high entropy of \n\nmolecules in liquid water).\n[49]\n\n As expected, C0 displayed very small values, which became \n\neven smaller on UHP treated samples (RHP), due to the formation of the monolayer. Also, \n\nk0, which was lower than 1, for samples treated with UHP, became higher than 1, possibly \n\ndue to the higher entropy existing between water molecules. As discussed before, these \n\nresults are in agreement with a higher accessibility to OH groups and a higher water \n\nuptake, due to UHP. \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 113 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  \n\nThe estimates of ?Hc and ?Hk (enthalpy of the monolayer formation and multilayer, \n\nrespectively)\n[49]\n\n, were determined. It was found from non-treated (R) to UHP treated \n\nsamples (RHP), an increase on ?Hc (from 98.3 to 133.1 kJ/mol) and a decrease on ?Hk \n\n(from 9.4 to -3.8kJ/mL). The ?Hc results are in agreement with the formation of a \n\nmonolayer in RHP, as discussed previously. Since a higher amount of water molecules are \n\nbound to the surface in the monolayer, a higher solvation enthalpy was registered. \n\nFurthermore, the decrease found on ?Hk, is also indicative of the decrease in importance of \n\nthe multilayer. As previously discussed, it is possible that with the formation of a more \n\ncomposed first layer of molecules at the surface (monolayer of RHP), the water molecules \n\nin the multilayer interact less intensively (in RHP comparatively to R), which requires less \n\nenthalpy to remove the multilayer molecules. \n\nFrom the values of ?Hc and ?Hk (Equation 2.7, Chapter 2, section 2.1.6.1.), it was \n\nalso possible to estimate the net isosteric heat of sorption (?Hs,t), which were 88.9 kJ/mol \n\nand 136.9 kJ/mol, respectively for R and RHP. The substantial increase found from the \n\nfirst to the latter, further supports UHP as a regenerative treatment, able to decrease the \n\nlimitation imputed by hornification on fibres hydration abilities. \n\nFor comparison, the moisture sorption isotherms of virgin fibres (E, S, EHP and \n\nSHP) were also fitted according to GAB model. The fitting results are displayed in Table \n\n3. 11 and 3. 12. From both tables, it is possible to observe that GAB described well all \n\nisotherms as displayed by the high values of R\n2\n (near 1) and low RMSE values. \n\nTable 3. 11 \u2013 Fitting and GAB parameters achieved from E and EHP non-linear regression, with confidence \n\nintervals of 95%. \n\nParameters \nE EHP \n\nGAB (25\u00baC) GAB (30\u00baC) GAB (35\u00baC) GAB (25\u00baC) GAB (30\u00baC) GAB (35\u00baC) \n\nR\n2\n 0,999 0,992 0,994 0,997 0,991 0,998 \n\nRMSE 4.6E-4 1.8E-3 1.4E-3 1.1E-3 1.6E-3 6.7E-4 \n\nC 56.1\u00b116.2 39.2\u00b133.0 30.1\u00b117.7 24.8\u00b113.6 21.1\u00b118.2 15.2\u00b17.0 \n\nXm 0.0308\u00b10.001 0.0298\u00b10.006 0.0266\u00b10.005 0.0248\u00b10.003 0.0202\u00b10.004 0.0146\u00b10.002 \n\nk 0.7836\u00b10.03 0.71\u00b10.2 0.682\u00b10.2 0.7865\u00b10.1 0.8417\u00b10.2 0.9121\u00b10.1 \n\nS(m\n2\n/g) 128.7 124.6 111.0 103.8 84.4 61.1 \n\n?Hc (kJ/mol) 47.5 37.4 \n\n?Hk (kJ/mol) 10.6 -11.3 \n\nC0 2.6E-7 7.0E-6 \n\nk0 1E-2 75.2 \n\n?Hs,t(kJ/mol) 36.9 48.7 \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 114 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  \n \n\nTable 3. 12 - Fitting and GAB parameters achieved from S and SHP non-linear regression, with confidence intervals of \n\n95%. \n\nParameters \nS SHP \n\nGAB (25\u00baC) GAB (30\u00baC) GAB (35\u00baC) GAB (25\u00baC) GAB (30\u00baC) GAB (35\u00baC) \n\nR\n2\n 0.997 0.996 0.997 0.997 0.997 0.997 \n\nRMSE 7.6E-4 8.4E-4 6.9E-4 7.2E-4 6.9E-4 6.4E-4 \n\nC 59.76\u00b160.0 26.36\u00b119.8 12.12\u00b16.5 42.36\u00b140.6 20.21\u00b112.8 8.126\u00b14.3 \n\nXm 0.01507\u00b10.002 0.0136\u00b10.002 0.01247\u00b10.002 0.01241\u00b10.001 0.01175\u00b10.002 0.01179\u00b10.002 \n\nk 0.9204\u00b10.07 0.9529\u00b10.08 0.9939\u00b10.08 0.9862\u00b10.06 0.9886\u00b10.07 0.9944\u00b10.08 \n\nS(m\n2\n/g) 63.02 56.88 52.15 51.90 49.14 49.31 \n\n?Hc (kJ/mol) 121.88 126.04 \n\n?Hk (kJ/mol) -5.87 -0.63 \n\nC0 2.64x10\n-20\n\n 3.62x10\n-21\n\n \n\nk0 9.79 1.27 \n\n?Hs,t(kJ/mol) 127.75 126.68 \n\nSimilarly to before, GAB parameters were estimated. The estimate of the monolayer, \n\nXm, as expected, decreased with increasing temperature. When comparing non-treated \n\nsamples (E and S) with UHP treated samples (EHP and SHP) a decrease of Xm was found. \n\nThese results are in agreement with the previously discussed decrease in the moisture \n\nuptake from virgin fibres treat with and without UHP. Due to the proportionality existing \n\nbetween Xm and S (specific surface area estimate), this last also exhibited the same trend \n\nrevealed by Xm, i.e. it decreased, with increasing temperature, from non-treated (E and S) \n\nto samples treated with UHP (EHP and SHP). Parameter C (from E and S to EHP and \n\nSHP, respectively), similarly to before, decreased with increasing temperature, as \n\nexpected. Also, when comparing non-treated (E and S) with fibres treated with UHP (EHP \n\nand SHP), the values where smaller for this last, which, as previously discussed, is related \n\nto the lower amount of water molecules required to form the monolayer, due the presence \n\nof strongly bound water.  \n\nAs regards parameter k results, with increasing temperature, the tendency found in E \n\nand EHP, was similar to that encountered on R and RHP, i.e. for samples not treated with \n\nUHP k decreased with temperature, while the opposite was verified on samples treated \n\nwith UHP. This suggests that in E the formation of multilayer has a higher contribution to \n\nwater sorption than in EHP, with increasing temperature. Also, when comparing untreated \n\n(E) with samples treated with UHP (EHP), k values were higher in this last. As previously \n\ndiscussed, it is suggested that the presence of strongly bound water may contribute to less \n\nintensive water interactions and thus a higher entropy between multilayer water molecules \n\n(as k tends to 1, water molecules properties approach those of bulk water). \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 115 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  \n\nIn the case of softwood virgin fibres, S and SHP, k values revealed a similar trend \n\n(increase), on both samples, with increasing temperature. With increasing temperature, in \n\nboth cases, the multilayer contribution to water sorption becomes less important. This \n\ndifference, relatively to hardwood fibres, could be attributed to the differences in the type \n\nof the fibres studied (different fibres morphology). Nevertheless, upon UHP treatment, \n\nfrom S to SHP, k values increased (nearer 1), which suggests, as discussed for E and EHP, \n\nthat the presence of strongly bound water in fibres contributes for the less intensive \n\ninteractions between multilayer molecules and for its higher entropy. \n\nSimilarly to before, from the temperature dependence of C and k, the parameters, C0, \n\nk0 and ?Hc and ?Hk were determined. Constant C0 revealed very small values as expected. \n\nParameter k0 revealed an increase upon UHP, from E to EHP. This trend is similar to that \n\nobserved from R to RHP, indicative of a higher entropy in multilayer water molecules, \n\nwhich endorses the already discussed hypothesis. In contrast with hardwood virgin fibres \n\nresults, in softwood virgin fibres, from S to SHP, k0 decreased, although its value remained \n\nhigher than 1. This result is indicative of a decrease in the entropy of multilayer molecules \n\non SHP. It is proposed, once more, that this difference in results between both virgin fibres \n\ncould be related with the differences in morphology existing between both types of fibres. \n\nParameters ?Hc and ?Hk were also estimated from GAB parameters. From E to EHP \n\n?Hc, displayed a decrease from 47.5 to 37.4 kJ/mol. This decrease is in agreement with \n\nprevious discussed results, since fewer water molecules form the monolayer, lower is the \n\nsolvation enthalpy registered. In opposite, from S to SHP (softwood virgin fibres) a small \n\nincrease from 121.88 to 126.04 kJ/mol was observed. While in the case of hardwood virgin \n\nfibres the results are in agreement with the retraction of the monolayer, in this case, this \n\nvariation could be attributed to method deviations.\n[45]\n\n \n\nAs concerns ?Hk, divergent results between hardwood and softwood pulps were once \n\nmore registered. From E to EHP a decrease was found, while from S to SHP an increase \n\nwas registered. While in the first case ?Hk decrease is in agreement with a lower \n\ncontribution of multilayer to water sorption discussed above, the second suggests the \n\nopposite. It is suggested that this divergence in results could be related with methods \n\ndeviations. It has been reported in the literature\n[45]\n\n that although GAB method is the most \n\nrecommended to describe cellulosic materials, its parameters may suffer great deviations \n\nand still present the same curve, which may explain some of the divergences found. \n\nNevertheless, considering both ?Hc and ?Hk, the net isosteric heat of sorption (?Hs,t) \n\nwas also estimated. The results achieved revealed an increase from E to EHP (from 36.9 to \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 116 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  \n \n\n48.7 kJ/mol) and a very small decrease from S to SHP (ca. 0.8%). Although water uptake \n\nwas lower from E to EHP, ?Hs,t increase could be related to the formation of more \n\nintensive interactions with the captured water molecules. In the case of S and SHP the \n\ndecrease observed could be explained by the decrease in the water uptake. Nevertheless, as \n\nmentioned above, due to some deviations of the model parameters, these results should be \n\ncomplemented with further studies with other techniques. \n\nIt is, however, noteworthy some of the similarities found between the results of \n\nrecycled fibres and hardwood virgin fibres. As confirmed in fibres characterization, \n\nrecycled fibres are made mostly of hardwood fibres, therefore this feature may explain the \n\nsimilitude in behaviour between each other results. \n\nThe total heat of sorption, Qs, was also estimated following Clausius-Clayperon \n\nrelationship (Equations 2.5 and 2.6 from Chapter 2, section 2.1.6.1.) along with GAB \n\nfittings for the three types of pulp, with and without UHP. \n\n  \n\n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 3. 13 \u2013 Total heat of sorption determined from Clausius-Clayperon relationship and GAB parameters, as function \n\nof moisture sorption (a) comparison between E and EHP with R and RHP; (b) comparison between S and SHP with E \n\nand EHP). \n\nThe total heat of sorption as a function of moisture sorption on the equilibrium (Xeq) \n\nis represented in Figure 3. 13a for hardwood fibres and recycled fibres and in Figure 3. 13b \n\nfor both virgin fibres. Recycled fibres exhibited a significant increase in its total heat of \n\nsorption, upon UHP, which is in agreement with its improved hydration abilities, as \n\ndiscussed before, although the values cannot be compared. \n\nVirgin fibres results were different between both types of pulps. Hardwood fibres, \n\nupon UHP (EHP), displayed a maximum that shifted at smaller Xeq, with higher Qs, that \n\nafterwards drops until the heat of sorption equals the heat of evaporation of water. Usually, \n\nhigh values of Qs maximum at low moisture content are associated with strong attraction \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 117 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  \n\nforces between active sorption sites and sorbate molecules in the monolayer, whereas \n\nlower values of Qs are associated with weaker interactions.\n[49]\n\n Therefore, it is suggested \n\nthat the increase in the total heat of sorption at low Xeq, in EHP, may be attributed to more \n\nintensive interactions, possibly due to the presence of the strongly bound water. \n\nIn the case of softwood virgin fibres (S and SHP) total heat of sorption, Qs, exhibited \n\ncurves with a maximum near each another. Although S exhibited a slightly higher one \n\n(174.4 kj/mol versus 172.0 kJ/mol), when comparing with SHP. Besides this difference, \n\nthe sample treated with UHP displayed a narrower curve. \n\nAs previously mentioned, it is possible that the observed variances/fluctuations on \n\nresults could be explained by the variation of the GAB parameters estimated. An example \n\nof that includes the fact that constant C varies greatly in magnitude,&lt;10 to >150000, for \n\nadsorption and desorption, with little influence on the shape of the isotherm. \n[45]\n\n This \n\nvariance, as regards the determination of other parameters dependent of C, may affect \n\ndirectly and induce variation on its estimation. Even though GAB model is considered the \n\nbest choice for fitting pulp and paper moisture sorption isotherms (with constants that have \n\na theoretical meaning), their interpretation sometimes could be less clear, similarly to \n\nempirical equations. \n[45]\n\n A way to improve the acquired data would possibly pass through \n\ntesting more temperatures to ensure a higher accuracy. \n\n3.3.3.4. Calorimetric analysis \n\nCalorimetric analysis was performed to determine the integral heat of wetting, on \n\nsamples treated with and without UHP. The results achieved are represented in Table 3. 13. \n\nRecycled fibres results, from R to RHP revealed an increase in the integral heat of \n\nwetting from R to RHP. These results suggest the presence of more free OH groups for \n\ninteraction with water, which is in agreement with previous results tendencies, such as the \n\ncase of moisture sorption isotherms, which brings further confirmation on the ability of \n\nUHP regenerating hornified recycled fibres hydration abilities.  \n\nAs regards virgin fibres, both hardwood and softwood virgin fibres registered a \n\ndecrease in the integral heat of wetting in samples treated with UHP. The results suggest \n\nthat less free OH groups were available for interaction with water, as discussed previously, \n\ndue to the strongly bound water presence. These results endorse previous ones, such as the \n\ntendencies observed in moisture sorption isotherms, and allow to confirm the effects \n\nbrought by UHP on cellulosic fibres. \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 118 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  \n \n\nTable 3. 13 \u2013 Integral heat of wetting of samples treated with (RHP, EHP, SHP) and without UHP treatment (R, E and \n\nS). \n\nSample Heat of Wetting (J/g) \n\nR 43.4 \n\nRHP 50.9 \n\nE 53.5 \n\nEHP 42.8 \n\nS 39.4 \n\nSHP 33.0 \n\n3.3.3.5. Thermal analysis DSC/TGA \n\nComplementary thermal analysis studies were carried out in order to evaluate the \n\nchanges in the vaporization enthalpy of hydrated samples (conditions of 100 HR%, at room \n\ntemperature). First, the samples moisture content was determined by TGA, then this data \n\nhelped to evaluate the vaporization enthalpy by DSC, through the integration of the \n\nendothermic peaks corresponding to moisture vaporization (Table 3. 14). \n\nTable 3. 14 \u2013 Moisture content and vaporization enthalpy of samples R, RHP, E, EHP, S and SHP, determined through \n\nthermal analysis. \n\nSample \nMoisture \n\ncontent (%) \n\nVaporization enthalpy \n\n(kJ/mol water) \n\nR 12.3 -16.6 \n\nRHP 13.6 -15.0 \n\nE 14.5 -2.5 \n\nEHP 11.8 -19.1 \n\nS 15.8 -18.3 \n\nSHP 14.3 -63.3 \n\nIn the case of recycled fibres, the results showed, from R to RHP, that the enthalpy \n\nof vaporization (required to evaporate free water) decreased slightly. It is possible that this \n\nresult is related with recycled fibres limited macroporosity, and thus a lower presence of \n\nfree water content. Even though UHP treatment promoted recycled fibres accessibility to \n\nfree OH groups, these last, as observed in moisture isotherms, help to formation the \n\nmonolayer, where molecules are interacting strongly with the surface (1\nst\n layer) and not \n\neasily removed by vaporization. However, it is not clear what happens in the case of free \n\nwater. Therefore, it is possible the small variation found in the vaporization enthalpy \n\nbetween both samples, are of little significance. \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 119 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  \n\nAs regards virgin fibres, in both cases, samples subjected to UHP treatment showed \n\nhigher vaporization enthalpies, when comparing with untreated samples. Contrarily to \n\nrecycled fibres, virgin ones have higher macropososity. Also, it is possible that the \n\ncombination of this trait with the increased accessibility to free OH (as result of UHP \n\ntreatment), may contribute to a higher content of free water. This hypothesis may explain \n\nthe increases in enthalpy found between non-treated and UHP-treated virgin pulp samples. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 120 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  \n \n\n3.4. Conclusions \n\nThe effects of UHP treatment on different cellulosic fibres (recycled and virgin \n\nhardwood and softwood fibres) were demonstrated. The studies allowed to conclude that \n\nUHP treatment promoted rearrangements on the studied fibres structure, namely fibril \n\ndisaggregation, the reverse of fibre collapse, and improved fibres accessibility, into sites \n\npreviously inaccessible. \n\nThe structural changes on fibres were primarily confirmed by XRD, \n13\n\nCNMR and \n\nFTIR of deuterated samples. Here the reorganization of crystalline/amorphous regions \n\nupon UHP was demonstrated by the increase of crystallinity and the increase of the \n\naverage crystallite size. Additionally, it was demonstrated that UHP treatment promotes \n\nfibres forced hydration and improved accessibility. While the first is more predominant in \n\nvirgin fibres, the latter plays a bigger role in the case of recycled fibres. In the case of this \n\nlast, this implies a decrease on the hornification of recycled fibres and improvement of its \n\nproperties, such as hydration. These were demonstrated by different tests (such as capillary \n\nrise, moisture sorption, the integral heat of wetting, etc). In the case of virgin fibres, the \n\npresence of significant amounts of strongly bound water, although it affected the available \n\nfree OH groups content (as demonstrated by H/D exchange, moisture sorption, calorimetric \n\nanalysis, etc), it improved hardwood fibres wettability and both types of virgin fibres \n\ncapillarity. \n\nThese results represent an interesting prospect over tissue paper production since \n\nthey validated the ability of UHP to improve recycled fibres properties, which affects not \n\nonly the manufacturing process but also the final products features. An example of a \n\nmanufacture advantage includes the lower zeta potential values of samples treated with \n\nUHP, which implies a lower demand of retention aids and even a better retention of other \n\nadditives such as dyes.  \n\nMoreover, the ability of UHP to further improve fibres properties, without \n\nmechanical or chemical processing, represents a potential alternative to improve fibres \n\nfeatures, such as recycled fibres hydration skills. It is noteworthy that the hydration \n\nabilities of fibres are of utter importance for tissue paper. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 121 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  \n\n3.5.

Introduction \n\nThe constant demand for improved performance of tissue papers has stimulated \n\ncompanies to develop more effective processes of stock preparation and paper sheet \n\nformation, for an improved productivity and quality parameters. Mechanical and physical \n\nproperties are rather relevant features on this matter, since they outline the end product\u2019s \n\nperformance. To improve these features, changes aimed to improve fibres performance \n\nmay be considered. \n[1,2]\n\n \n\nThe bonding between fibres governs paper sheet properties. This is due to the \n\nformation of hydrogen bonds between fibres that are drawn together and oriented by water \n\nstream during papermaking. The adequate alignment of fibrils and their bonding between \n\none another, in a paper sheet, provides fibres considerable resistance to being pulled out. \n\nThis resistance is higher with increasing fibre length, fibre organization and mutual \n\ncompression on the crossover areas of the fibres, as well as by the cohesiveness of all the \n\nfibrils, that are on contacting surfaces and that range in size from the visible to molecular. \n\n[2,3]\n Hemicelluloses on fibres also play an important role on fibre bonding, not only by \n\nbeing present on their surfaces providing sites for interfibre interaction, but also by \n\nattracting water into the interior of fibres, softening its structure and turning it less rigid.\n[2\u2013\n\n4]\n \n\nDuring papermaking processing many changes occur, yielding losses on pulps \n\nproperties. These effects affect strongly recycled fibres due to the repetitive cycles of \n\ndrying, swelling and pressing those were subjected.\n[5\u20137]\n\n However, drying is still accounted \n\nas the main responsible affecting fibres properties. It influences negatively fibre\u2019s strength, \n\nfibre\u2019s swelling and it\u2019s bonding, which affects directly paper strength features.\n[5,8\u201310]\n\n \n\nThese changes are mainly caused by the hornification effect. As mentioned in previous \n\nchapters, hornification occurs due to structural changes on fibres, induced by stressful \n\nconditions (such as drying, pressing, etc), which prompts rearrangements on the fibres \n\nchains, fibril aggregation resulting in the irreversible deterioration of papermaking \n\nproperties. In particular, hornification lead to losses on fibres hydration abilities and turns \n\nthem stiffer. \n[11,12]\n\n In order to decrease the effects of hornification different approaches may \n\nbe followed, such as chemical treatments with alkaline solutions or beating. \n[5,7,8,12,13]\n\n \n\nThe variety of pulp feedstocks available for papermaking made a demand for a \n\nfundamental process able to improve fibres quality that can be applied on all types of \n\npulps. With this purpose, pulp beating, one of the main processes used in stock preparation, \n\nis often employed.\n[14]\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 130 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter IV | The effect of ultra-high pressure on the papermaking properties of pulp \n\nPulp beating or refining consists in pulps mechanical modification to achieve pulp \n\nproperties suitable for papermaking. \n[14,15]\n\n. Its main purposes include improving fibres \n\nbonding ability (to form strong and smooth paper sheet), swelling in water, sometimes \n\nshorten long fibres for a better sheet formation, or to develop other pulp properties such as \n\nabsorbency, porosity, or optical properties.\n[16]\n\n \n\nBeating enables fibres to \u201cfelt\u201d uniformly, to soften, and to fibrillate, in order to \n\nimpart strength to paper. The main effects caused by beating include i) fines creation; ii) \n\ninternal and external fibrillation; iii) fibre cutting or shortening and iv) fibres \n\ndeformation.\n[3,15,16]\n\nTogether these effects are able to induce important changes to pulp. \n\nBeating improves paper strength properties, prompts a reluctance of fibres to part with \n\nwater (on the paper machine) and improves the affinity and retention of additives, such as \n\ndyes and filling materials. Internal fibrillation, also allows the sorption of additional water \n\naround the newly exposed inner surfaces, therefore improving the ability of fibres to \n\ninteract with water. However, because fibres surfaces are fibrillated, swelling enables \n\nfibrils not only to form extra links with adjacent surfaces, (especially if the surfaces are \n\nrough), but also to increase fibres bounding area by forming reinforcements around it. \n[3,14\u2013\n\n17]\n \n\nUltra-high hydrostatic pressure (UHP) emerges here also as a potential non-\n\ndegradative treatment able to improve pulp and paper properties. Studies employing UHP \n\non cellulosic fibres have demonstrated the UHP effects on fibres, namely its ability to \n\ninduce rearrangements on fibrils, yielding fibril disaggregation, and thus higher \n\naccessibility into sites previously inaccessible (rearrangements and decrease on fibres \n\nhornification). \n[18\u201320]\n\n Therefore, the effect of UHP pre-treatment of recycled and virgin \n\nfibres on the papermaking properties of corresponding pulps was studied. The UHP effect \n\non the pulps beating behaviour was evaluated when the treatment was applied just before \n\nthe beating or in the middle of the refining process. Simultaneously, the development of \n\nstrength properties of pulps was assessed. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 131 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter IV | The effect of ultra-high pressure on the papermaking properties of pulp \n\n4.2. Materials and Methods \n\nCellulosic pulps were provided by Renova, namely Recycled fibres, R, bleached \n\nEucalyptus Globulus industrial kraft pulp, E and bleached softwood pulp, S. The pulps \n\nused in these studies were the same as mentioned in previous chapter. \n\n4.2.1. Sequences of beating and UHP treatment \n\nThe combination of beating with UHP treatment and its benefits was studied \n\naccording to three different sequences (Table 4. 1): B-HP (beating followed by UHP \n\ntreatment), HP-B (UHP treatment followed by beating), and B1-HP-B2 (beating at fixed \n\nnumber of PFI revolutions, followed by UHP treatment and finalizing beating).  \n\nThe three sequences were employed considering fixed UHP conditions (400 MPa, 10 \n\nmin), and in case of B1-HP-B2, a fixed pre-beating treatment (fixed PFI revolutions) was \n\napplied to pulp samples, followed by UHP treatment and by a last beating stage. \n\nTable 4. 1- Sequences of beating and UHP processing carried out using three pulp samples (E, S and R). \n\nSequences \n\nFixed Pressure (400 MPa, 10 min) \n\nR \n\n(PFI revolutions/no.) \n\nE \n\n(PFI revolutions/no.) \n\nS \n\n(PFI revolutions/no.) \n\nB-HP \n0-2500 0-6000 0-10000 \n\nHP-B \n\nB1-HP-B2 \n\nTotal PFI revolutions (T) =B1+B2 \n\nB1=500 \n\nT : 0 \u2013 2500 \n\nB1=1000 \n\nT : 0 \u2013 6000 \n\nB1=1000 \n\nT:0-10000 \n\nPressure variation studies were also performed, considering UHP pressure condition \n\nof 400 MPa, 500 MPa and 600 MPa, 10 min, at fixed beating conditions (1000 PFI \n\nrevolutions for R, 3000 PFI revolutions for E and 6000 revolutions for S) \n\n4.2.2. Hydrostatic ultra-high pressure (UHP) treatment \n\nUHP treatment was carried out with a pulp suspension, dispersed in distilled water \n\n(2% consistency), sealed in HDPE flasks, and submitted to hydrostatic high pressure (400 \n\nMPa, 500 MPa or 600 MPa), at room temperature (20 \u00baC), on a Hyperbaric model 55 \n\nequipment. Afterwards, if UHP was the last stage of the ongoing sequence, a part of the \n\nsample was filtered, air dried (to ca. 8%) and stored, while the other part was directly used \n\nto prepare standard handsheets.  \n\nIn case of samples that were to be subjected to beating, after UHP, these were filtered \n\nuntil they met the conditions required for that step. \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 132 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter IV | The effect of ultra-high pressure on the papermaking properties of pulp \n\n4.2.3. Pulp beating \n\nPrevious to pulp beating samples weighting 30 g (moisture free) were prepared and \n\nthen dispersed in agreement with ISO 5263-1:2004. Beating was carried out on a PFI mill \n\naccording to ISO 5264-2:2011. \n\n4.2.4. Handsheet preparation \n\nWhen required standard paper handsheets were prepared according to ISO 5269-2, \n\non a Rapid-K\u00f6then (Karl Schr\u00f6der KG) sheet former. \n\n4.2.5. Physical and mechanical properties analysis \n\nFibres drainability was tested by analysing the Schopper-Riegler degree according to \n\nISO 5267-1:1999. Also the handsheets thickness, density, specific volume and bulk were \n\nevaluated according to ISO 534:2011. Tensile index, stretch%, Tear index, burst index, air \n\nresistance (Gurley method) and capillary rise, were evaluated in every sample according to, \n\nISO 1924-2:2008, ISO 1974:2012, ISO 2758:2014, ISO 5636-5:2013 and ISO 8787:1986, \n\nrespectively. Opacity was also evaluated in agreement with ISO 2471:2008. \n\n4.2.6. Fibre analysis \n\nAlterations on fibres morphology were monitored with a Fibre Tester from Lorentzen \n\n&amp; Wettre. To do so, 0.2 g of moisture free pulp was dispersed in 200 mL of distilled water. \n\nAfter dispersion was achieved, all suspensions were positioned to be analysed by the \n\nequipment, using available software. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 133 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter IV | The effect of ultra-high pressure on the papermaking properties of pulp \n\n4.3. Results and Discussion \n\n4.3.1. Pulp drainability \n\nHardwood virgin pulp (E), softwood virgin pulp (S) and recycled pulp (R) were \n\nsubmitted to different sequences of beating and UHP treatment, to investigate the benefits \n\nbrought by the combination of these treatments to fibres properties. The applied sequences \n\nwere HP-B (UHP followed by beating), B-HP (beating followed by UHP) and B1-HP-B2 \n\n(beating pre-treatment at fixed PFI revolutions, followed by UHP and beating) (Table 4. 1). \n\nFor these tests the pressure applied on pulp suspensions was fixed at 400 MPa (10 min). \n\nPulps drainability was investigated for the three pulp types, as function of PFI revolution \n\n(Figure 4. 1). \n\n  \n(a) (b) \n\n \n(c) \n\nFigure 4. 1 \u2013 Drainability as a function of PFI revolutions of R (a), E (b) and S (c) pulp, treated by sequences HP-B, B-\n\nHP and B1-HP-B2. \n\nConsidering the profiles achieved for R samples series (Figure 4. 1a), it was found \n\nthat sequences HP-B and B1-HP-B2 exhibited higher \u00baSR, with increasing PFI \n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n70\n\n75\n\n80\n\n0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500\n\n\u00b0S\nR\n\n \n\nPFI revolutions (no.) \n\nR\n\nHP-B\n\nB-HP\n\nB1-HP-B2\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n0 2000 4000\n\n\u00b0S\nR\n\n \n\nPFI revolutions (no.) \n\nE\n\nHP-B\n\nB-HP\n\nB1-HP-B2\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000\n\n\u00b0S\nR\n\n \n\nPFI revolutions (no.) \n\nS\n\nHP-B\n\nB-HP\n\nB1-HP-B2\n\n\n\n \n\n~ 134 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter IV | The effect of ultra-high pressure on the papermaking properties of pulp \n\nrevolutions, when compared to R without UHP treatment. The registered increase of \u00baSR \n\nin these trials was up to twice to that without UHP treatment, meaning that half energy \n\nmay be required to develop fibres into that point. These results in terms of energy cost \n\nconstitute a rather attractive point, since beating contributes to the major energy \n\nconsumption in papermaking. \n\nOn the other hand, as concerns sequence B-HP, a slight lower values of \u00baSR were \n\nregistered, with respect to R, which was attributed to UHP treatment as the last stage. It \n\nhas been demonstrated in previous chapters and literature\n[20]\n\n that UHP induces fibril \n\ndisaggregation and forced hydration, causing fibrils enlargement. This explains the results \n\nachieved by B-HP, since fibres are \u201cbulkier\u201d, there is more vacant space between one \n\nanother, being easier for water to drain. \n\n At the same time, by applying beating after UHP treatment (HP-B) it seems that \n\nfibres became more susceptible to beating (enhanced fibre accessibility caused by UHP \n\ntreatment) and thus, higher fibrillation may be achieved. These events are in agreement \n\nwith the increased water draining resistance (higher \u00baSR values). Similarly, the same \n\njustification may be used to explain the behaviour in B1-HP-B2 sequence. In this case, the \n\ninitial beating stage fibrillates fibres, which after UHP become \u201cbulkier\u201d, being more \n\naccessible to water (UHP effect). At the last beating stage, further fibrillation took place, \n\nwhich explains the substantial increase on beatability, and therefore the increased \n\nresistance to water draining. \n\nIn case of virgin fibres E and S (Figures 4. 1b and c, respectively), sequence B1-HP-\n\nB2, registered a slight increase on \u00baSR between 2000 and 4000 PFI revolutions and as \n\nhigh as 6000 PFI revolutions, respectively. The other two sequences (B-HP and HP-B), in \n\nboth cases (E and S) displayed either slightly lower or similar \u00baSR values. The use of UHP \n\ntreatment after beating, and thus fibres enlargement (due to forced hydration), explain the \n\ndecrease of \u00baSR. Since fibres became \u201cbulkier\u201d, with less hydration capacity more non-\n\nbond water is available, thus favouring the water draining. The beating after UHP \n\ntreatment (HP-B) results, for hardwood virgin pulps (E pulps), showed slightly lower or \n\nsimilar \u00baSR relatively to untreated pulp, E. Overall again B1-HP-B2 sequence enabled the \n\nhigher increase on \u00baSR values, for the three evaluated pulps. \n\n4.3.2. Fibre Morphology \n\nVariations on fibres morphology were also analysed by parameters such as weight-\n\naverage length (Lw), coarseness, and mean kink index. These parameters were analysed at \n\nfixed beating conditions (1000 PFI revolutions for R, 3000 PFI revolutions for E and 6000 \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 135 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter IV | The effect of ultra-high pressure on the papermaking properties of pulp \n\nPFI revolutions for S), and at fixed pressure conditions (400MPa, 10min), for all \n\nsequences. \n\nTable 4. 2 display the results obtained for recycled fibres (R samples). As concerns \n\nthe fibre length, only upon sequence B1-HP-B2 a decrease in fibres length was registered. \n\nThis may be attributed to fibres shortening induced by the 2\nnd\n\n step of beating, probably due \n\nto the increased coarseness of fibres after UHP processing. In fact, an increase of \n\ncoarseness was registered, of 29% and 28%, from R to HP-B, and from R to B-HP, \n\nrespectively (Table 4. 2). The use of UHP may explain these increases, since, as mentioned \n\nbefore, it provokes forced hydration and thus fibrils enlargement (cell wall \n\nenlargement).\n[20]\n\n However, in the sequence B1-HP-B2, the final coarseness was diminished \n\nin relation to HP-B and B-HP segments, due to fibre wall dilapidation, result from the \n\nsynergetic effect of UHP treatment with two beating stages. \n\nMean kink index results revealed a decrease from R to HP-B, and from R to B-HP, \n\nof 30% and 28%, respectively. The decrease of the number of deformations in fibres could \n\nbe associated to the combination of effects brought by UHP treatment, (disaggregation and \n\nforced hydration) and beating (fibres straightening). \n\nTable 4. 2 \u2013 Fibres analysis parameter, for non-treated R, and R submitted to sequences HP-B, B-HP and B1-HP-B2 at \n\nfixed conditions (400MPa, 10min and 1000 PFI revolutions) \n\nSample R HP-B B-HP B1-HP-B2 \n\nLw (mm) \u00b1 0.004 0.86 0.86 0.86 0.82 \n\nCoarseness (?g/m) \u00b1 1.0 146.5 189.3 187.6 132.3 \n\nMean kink index \u00b1 0.008 2.65 1.87 1.90 2.53 \n\nVirgin pulps E and S, were also analysed for variations on fibre morphology.

Thus, it is possible that hardwood virgin fibres (short fibres) are not as \n\naffected by fibres shorting and cutting during beating, as recycled fibres (made majorly \n\nform hardwood fibres, as determined in Chapter 3). Also for being short they may be less \n\nprone to deformations relatively longer fibres. As regards S samples, slight variations were \n\nverified within the error of determination.  \n\nCoarseness results, similarly to length, revealed small variations on E samples, upon \n\nthe different sequences of refining. Due to UHP treatment, in B-HP and HP-B sequences a \n\nhigher coarseness was registered, than with unbeaten pulps, which is in agreement with \n\nUHP aptitude for forced hydration and fibril enlargement. However, upon B1-HP-B2, the \n\ncombination of two beating sequences with UHP reduced coarseness, due to an improved \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 136 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter IV | The effect of ultra-high pressure on the papermaking properties of pulp \n\nbeating efficacy (higher cell wall dilapidation). Like hardwood virgin fibres, softwood \n\nvirgin fibres, S, exhibited a similar behaviour. This result may be explained by the \n\nhypothesis used to discuss hardwood virgin fibres results.  \n\nMean kink index data exhibited its decrease in hardwood virgin fibres, E, \n\ndeformations (such as wrinkles or knees) (ca. 15%) for B-HP and an increase (ca. 11%) in \n\ncase of HP-B. As for B1-HP-B2, this last did not exhibited relevant variations. These \n\nresults suggest that UHP as last stage, enabled fibre straightening and the decrease on the \n\nfibres deformations. Thus it is possible that improved straightening of fibres thanks to UHP \n\nforced hydration and fibres enlargement could explain the results achieved.\n[20]\n\n \n\nAs regards the mean kink index results for S fibres, the variation found displayed \n\nrather variable behaviour. This variation could be ascribed to their length and thus variable \n\nbehaviour towards both UHP and beating. \n\nTable 4. 3 - Fibre analysis parameters, for non-treated E and S, along with E and S subjected to sequences HP-B, B-HP \n\nand B1-HP-B2, at fixed conditions (400MPa, 10min, with 3000 PFI revolutions for E and 6000 PFI revolution for S) \n\n E HP-B B-HP B1-HP-B2 \n\nLw (mm)\u00b1 0.005 0.75 0.75 0.76 0.75 \n\nCoarseness (?g/m) \u00b1 1.3 84.6 86.5 85.1 83.3 \n\nMean kink index \u00b1 0.02 2.26 2.50 1.92 2.22 \n\n S HP-B B-HP B1-HP-B2 \n\nLw (mm) \u00b1 0.01 1.78 1.79 1.79 1.78 \n\nCoarseness (?g/m) \u00b1 1.2 181.3 192.7 193.1 180.3 \n\nMean kink index \u00b1 0.01 1.73 2.29 1.49 2.28 \n\n4.3.3.

As regards \n\nR samples (Figure 4. 2a), a decrease of bulk in HP-B and B1-HP-B2 sequences was \n\nobserved, comparatively to R, while, in case of B-HP, a slight increase was found. These \n\nresults suggest that the first two sequences were able to produce denser handsheets, while \n\nB-HP revealed the opposite effect.  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 137 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter IV | The effect of ultra-high pressure on the papermaking properties of pulp \n\n  \n(a) (b) \n\n \n(c) \n\nFigure 4. 2 \u2013 Bulk (cm\n3\n/g) as a function of PFI revolutions of R (a), E (b) and S (c) pulps, treated by sequences HP-B, B-HP \n\nand B1-HP-B2. \n\nAn explanation for the increased paper density may be related with increased fibres \n\nfibrillation (resulting from beating), which agrees with increased \u00baSR values (Figure 4. 1). \n\nBesides, beating favoured fibres plasticity and compressibility for a more efficient packing \n\nof fibres, enabling the formation of dense handsheets, as seen after HP-B and B1-HP-B2 \n\nsequences. \n\nOn the other hand, applying UHP after beating (B-HP) showed different features, \n\nsuggesting that beating let fibres became more accessible during UHP treatment to forced \n\nhydration. As result from this last, fibres become \u201cbulkier\u201d (fibres enlargement) creating \n\nhigher porosity on handsheet network, and thus decreased density. \n\nHardwood virgin fibres, E samples (Figure 4. 2b) revealed no significant bulk \n\nvariations in different beating sequences.

These observations, in general, indicated the increase of paper porosity, \n\nwhile applying UHP before, and, especially, after beating. This is in tune with increased \n\nbulk of pulp handsheets, upon last UHP stage, in the beating sequence. It is thus \n\nunderstandable that coarser and bulkier elastic fibres form more porous network, than less \n\ncoarse and plastic fibres possessing increased contact area. \n\nSimilar features were found for virgin fibres in E and S pulps (Figures 4. 7b and c), \n\nespecially when high refining energies are involved (>2000 revolutions for E and >6000 \n\nrevolutions for S). It is possible that in the case of S (softwood fibres), by applying UHP \n\nconjugated with two beating stages, higher impact on fibres is achieved (more fibrillation, \n\ndeformation, fibres shortening, cutting, fines formation), rendering higher bonding area \n\nimproved fibre packing, and thus less vacant sites (less porosity). \n\nIt may be also claimed that differences found between the beating sequences for \n\nrecycled fibres and virgin fibres could be related with the fact that recycled fibres were \n\nalready beaten in the past. \n\n4.3.4.

These properties \n\ninclude opacity (an optical property) and capillarity (measure of paper hydration abilities). \n\nThe dependence of optic properties, i.e. opacity and capillarity for different beating \n\nschemes with UHP were also evaluated. \n\nAs could be expected, pulps refined in conjugation with UHP stages demonstrated \n\nhigh opacities than conventional beaten pulps (Figure 4. 8). The highest increase of opacity \n\nwas registered when the beating sequence was before UHP treatment (B-HP and B1-HP-\n\nB2). This can be explained by bulkier pulps fibres obtained in these sequences (Figure 4. \n\n2). The highest light reflectance was observed for the recycled fibres. The highest effect of \n\nUHP stages on the opacity increment was also obtained for recycled pulp (Figure 4. 8). \n\nThis fact may be justified by the presence of residual fillers not eliminated completely \n\nfrom recycled pulp upon purification. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 144 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter IV | The effect of ultra-high pressure on the papermaking properties of pulp \n\n  \n(a) (b) \n\n \n(c) \n\nFigure 4. 8 \u2013 Opacity (%) as a function of PFI revolutions of R (a), E (b) and S (c) pulps, treated with sequences HP-\n\nB, B-HP and B1-HP-B2. \n\nVariations on fibres hydration skills were also studied by capillarity tests.

Effect of UHP conditions on the pulp beating \n\n4.3.5.1.  Properties \n\nThe physical and mechanical properties were further analysed considering increased \n\npressure conditions (500 and 600 MPa) at fixed beating conditions (for R at 1000 PFI \n\nrevolutions, for E at 3000 PFI revolutions and for S at 6000 revolutions). Similar to before \n\ndrainability, bulk, burst index, tensile strength, stretch (%), tear index, air resistance, \n\nopacity (%) and capillarity were evaluated.  \n\nResults of drainability as function of pressure (\u00baSR versus pressure), are shown in \n\nFigure 4. 10a for R samples series. The results revealed that, when pressure was risen, HP-\n\nB sequence displayed always increased beating degree values. Also, B1-HP-B2 sequence \n\nexhibited increased beating degree values with a maximum at 500 MPa, followed by a \n\ndecrease at 600 MPa. As for B-HP, the decrease already registered at 400 MPa was further \n\nboosted. These values could be indicative that employing higher pressures could lead \n\ntowards stronger UHP effects on sequence treatments. \n\nIn the case of E samples (Figure 4. 10b), overall higher pressures prompted a small \n\nand not very significant decrease of beating degree, except for B1-HP-B2, which increased \n\nat 400 MPa. For 500 MPa and 600 MPa the beating degree values were near those of \n\nuntreated sample or slightly lower. As for HP-B the variations were not significant. \n\nSimilarly, S pulp fibres (Figure 4. 10c) also exhibited lower or similar results to untreated \n\npulps, with exception of HP-B at 500 MPa and B1-HP-B2 at 400 MPa. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 147 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter IV | The effect of ultra-high pressure on the papermaking properties of pulp \n\n  \n\n(a) (b) \n\n \n\n(c) \n\nFigure 4. 10 - Drainability of R samples (a), E samples (b) and S samples (c), upon treatment with sequences HP-B, B-\n\nHP and B1-HP-B2, at fixed beating conditions (R=1000 PFI revolutions, E=3000 PFI revolutions and S=6000 \n\nrevolutions), as a function of pressure (0, 400, 500 and 600 MPa, 10 min). \n\nBulk was also analysed for pressure conditions between 400 and 600 MPa. In the \n\ncase of R samples series, (Figure 4. 11a), sequences HP-B and B1-HP-B2, from 400MPa to \n\n500 MPa and 600 MPa, exhibited a small decrease of bulk values, with a minimum at 500 \n\nMPa. At the same time, B-HP sequence did not exhibit significant variations. Also, B-HP \n\nsequence displayed similar results to untreated pulp. In the case of low bulk values, dense \n\nhandsheets are formed possibly due to an improved fibres plasticity (synergetic effect of \n\nUHP and beating, as previously discussed). \n\nAs concerns E samples series (Figure 4. 11b), at increased pressure, an increase in \n\nbulk was found in B-HP sequence and to some extent, in B1-HP-B2 sequence, while in the \n\ncase of sequence HP-B, lower or similar bulk results were registered.

Fibre morphology analysis \n\n The effect of different pressures in UHP treatment on fibres morphologies was \n\nperformed at pressure values ranging from 400 to 600 MPa, at fixed beating conditions (at \n\n1000 PFI revolutions for R, at 3000 PFI revolutions for E and at 6000 PFI revolutions for \n\nS). The data for recycled fibres is displayed in Table 4. 4, while virgin fibres results are \n\nshown in Table 4. 5. \n\n For the pressures as high as 400 MPa, no decrease in fibres length was detected in \n\nany beating sequence conjugated with UHP steps. This means that internal and external \n\nfibrillation were predominant over shortening. Such result may be due to improved fibres \n\nhydration, with increased pressure in UHP treatment that affected the plasticity of fibres, \n\nthus becoming less prone to shortening. Coarseness of fibres was clearly decreased, while \n\nincreasing the pressure in UHP stage, in all beating sequences, indicating an improve fibre \n\nwall fibrillation/dilapidation. The mean kin index values were either similar to those of 400 \n\nMPa or higher, suggesting enhanced fibres deformation, possibly resultant from a \n\ndecreased coarseness. \n\nTable 4. 4 - Fibres characteristics, for non-treated R pulps and R pulps subjected to beating sequences HP-B, B-HP and \n\nB1-HP-B2, at fixed beating conditions and at different pressures in UHP stage (400, 500 and 600 MPa). \n\nR \n\nWithout HP 400 MPa 500 MPa 600 MPa \n\nR HP-B B-HP B1-HP-B2 HP-B B-HP B1-HP-B2 HP-B B-HP B1-HP-B2 \n\nLength (mm) \n\n\u00b10.04 \n0.86 0.86 0.86 0.82 0.84 0.84 0.85 0.85 0.85 0.85 \n\nCoarseness (?g/m) \n\n\u00b1 9 \n146.5 189.3 187.6 132.3 146.9 149.5 122.0 120.4 173.6 110.4 \n\nMean kink index \n\n\u00b10.13 \n2.65 1.87 1.90 2.53 2.58 2.06 2.63 2.46 1.80 2.05 \n\nAs concerns virgin fibres, E and S, series (Table 4. 5), its length was not \n\nsubstantially affected in beating sequences, with increasing pressure (over 400 MPa). This \n\nresult is in agreement with an intact fibre walls in virgin pulps, in opposite to recycled \n\nfibres (damaged and previously beaten fibres). In the case of E samples, no changes in \n\ncoarseness were observed with an increase of pressures in UHP stages. As a rule, mean \n\nkink index was decreased in sequences with the UHP stage after beating (B-HP and B1-\n\nHP-B2), when pressures raised from 400 to 600 MPa. \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 157 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter IV | The effect of ultra-high pressure on the papermaking properties of pulp \n\nSimilar tendencies, as with hardwood pulp E, were obtained with softwood pulp, S, \n\n(Table 4. 5), thought the decrease of mean kink index was observed only after B-HP \n\nsequence in the pressure range of 400-600 MPa. \n\nThe differences in coarseness dependences in different beating sequences of \n\nrecycled (R) and similar by nature virgin (E) pulp may be assigned to fibres morphologies. \n\nThus, recycled fibres are strongly damaged and practically have no primary cell wall, \n\nwhereas virgin fibres possess an intact cell wall. This fact predetermines the easier \n\nexpansion of secondary wall in R than in E. Hence, mechanical peeling of the formers is \n\nrelatively fast. This explains the coarseness decrease in R with increased pressures in UHP \n\nstage and it low variation with pressure in E. \n\nTable 4. 5 - Fibres characteristics, for non-treated virgin pulps (E and S) and virgin fibres subjected to sequences HP-B, \n\nB-HP and B1-HP-B2, at fixed beating conditions and at different pressures in UHP stage (400, 500 and 600 MPa). \n\nE \n\nWithout HP 400 MPa 500 MPa 600 MPa \n\nE HP-B B-HP B1-HP-B2 HP-B B-HP B1-HP-B2 HP-B B-HP B1-HP-B2 \n\nLength (mm) \n\n\u00b10.03 \n0.75 0.75 0.75 0.76 0.75 0.75 0.75 0.74 0.75 0.76 \n\nCoarseness (?g/m) \n\n\u00b15 \n84,6 86,5 85,1 83,3 80,5 84,2 82,1 89,5 87,1 89,5 \n\nMean kink index \n\n\u00b10.12 \n2,26 2,50 1,93 2,22 2,30 1,76 2,19 2,34 1,79 0,98 \n\nS \n\nWithout HP 400MPa 500MPa 600MPa \n\nS HP-B B-HP B1-HP-B2 HP-B B-HP B1-HP-B2 HP-B B-HP B1-HP-B2 \n\nLength (mm) \n\n\u00b10.08 \n1.78 1.79 1.79 1.78 1.78 1.77 1.84 1.77 1.79 1.77 \n\nCoarseness (?g/m) \n\n\u00b110 \n181.3 192.7 193.1 180.3 176.4 189.8 193.7 178.6 194.1 185.0 \n\nMean kink index \n\n\u00b10.12 \n1.73 2.29 1.49 2.28 2.32 1.55 2.04 2.38 1.45 2.41 \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 158 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter IV | The effect of ultra-high pressure on the papermaking properties of pulp \n\n4.4. Conclusions \n\nThe results of this study revealed the effect of UHP treatment on papermaking \n\nproperties of both recycled (R) and virgin hardwood (E) and softwood (S) pulps. The \n\nforced hydration of fibres upon UHP treatment, in general, favours the defibration in \n\nsubsequent beating stages, which, however, was not necessary reflected by the formal \n\nincreasing of beating degree (\u00baSR). This was particularly notable when UHP stage was \n\napplied after the beating stage (B-HP sequence). Recycled pulp showed the highest \n\nincrease in formally determined pulp beatability (up to twice) in the B1-HP-B2 beating \n\nsequence (pre-beating followed by UHP step and posterior beating stage). These \n\nimprovements in beating were fairly moderated in the case of virgin pulps (E and S). The \n\nincrease of pressure in UHP treatment from 400 to 500 or 600 MPa led to the acceleration \n\nof beating in the case of recycled fibres, especially in the HP-B sequence (UHP pre-\n\ntreatment stage followed by beating), and to moderate or negligible beating improvement \n\nin the case of virgin pulps. The observed differences in UHP effect of beating behaviour \n\nfor recycled and virgin fibre were explained by different fibre morphologies (intact or \n\ndegraded primary cell walls). \n\nThe improved beating of both recycled and virgin fibres was not always transformed \n\ninto the improvement of strength properties of refined pulps. This fact was related to the \n\nforced hydration of fibres leading to their increased elasticity and some decreased bonding \n\ncapacity, due to the smaller overlapping of fibres (less interfibrillar surface) and \n\ndiminished amount of free groups (part of OH groups are involved in water clathrates). \n\nPhysical properties were improved to some extent, while increasing the hydraulic pressure \n\nin UHP treatment from 400 to 500 or 600 MPa. The improvements depended from pulp \n\norigin and were minimal for recycled pulp and maximal for virgin softwood pulp (from 10 \n\nto 20%). Optimal pressures in UHP step depended of pulp origins and beating sequences \n\napplied. \n\nThe combination of UHP treatment and beating in various combinations allowed \n\nimprovements of pulp handsheets opacity and capillarity. The highest improvement of \n\ncapillarity was found for recycled and virgin softwood pulps, (more than twice), which was \n\nalways enhanced by increasing of pressure in UHP stage. \n\nIt may be also concluded that the best desired properties of papers will be dependent \n\non pulps origin and the beating sequence applied under particularly optimised conditions. \n\nOverall, UHP treatment may be an interesting tool to improve recycled and virgin pulps \n\nperformance in the production of tissue papers. \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 159 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter IV | The effect of ultra-high pressure on the papermaking properties of pulp \n\n4.5.

Introduction \n\nThe production of recycled paper has grown all over the world.\n[1,2]\n\n This increase was \n\nessentially driven by political issues, consumer\u2019s demands and environmental awareness. \n\nNowadays nearly 30-50% of cellulosic fibres are recycled worldwide and its consumption \n\noffers several advantages. Its use in papermaking contributes to reducing the depletion of \n\nforest resources and to decrease energy and water consumption.\n[3\u20135]\n\n However, several \n\ndisadvantages can still be associated with recycled paper. The main problems are related to \n\n(i) the feedstock variability, (ii) significant losses on fibres strength properties due to \n\nhornification, and (iii) the presence of impurities (such as inks, glues, stickies, etc.).\n[6,7]\n\n \n\nYet, hornification is still considered the main responsible for the losses of recycled pulp \n\nstrength properties. It occurs as results of the stressful conditions fibres are submitted, \n\nrepeatedly, during their lifecycle (pressing and drying during paper production, re-pulping \n\nageing, etc.). These factors contribute to irreversible changes in fibres structure, yielding \n\nits surface collapse, shrinkage, stiffening and limited swelling in water.\n[8\u201310]\n\n As result, \n\nrecycled pulps strength decreases considerably, which limits its re-use in papermaking. In \n\ntruth, it is almost impossible to use 100% recycled fibres in paper composition without the \n\naddition of a significant proportion of virgin pulp. Additionally, the number of re-using \n\ncycles of recycled pulp is limited to 3-5.\n[3\u20135]\n\n In order to improve recycled fibres \n\nperformance, different approaches may be followed, being the most conventional chemical \n\ntreatments (swelling with alkaline solutions) and reactive refining (beating with enzymes \n\naid or some inorganic bases/salts) in water. \n[6,8,11\u201313]\n\n \n\nEnzymes have been recognised as an environmentally friendly solution in fibre \n\nmodification. These act selectively on fibres constituents, improving its strength properties \n\nand promoting the inter-fibre bonding in paper.\n[14,15]\n\n In what concerns recycled fibres, its \n\ntreatment with some hydrolytic enzymes enables improved removal of ink and other \n\nimpurities, while retaining fibres properties, as much as possible.\n[16]\n\n Enzymes such as \n\ncellulases, hemicellulases, amylases, and lipases could be used separately or in \n\nconjunction, depending on the type of waste paper and impurities, to optimize the \n\npurification process. Generally, enzymatic treatment occurs either by attacking the ink or \n\nthe fibre surface on the fibre-ink interface. Thus, lipases and esterases degrade vegetable \n\noil-based inks, while pectinases, hemicellulases, cellulases and ligninolytic enzymes alter \n\nthe fibre surface or the bond close to ink particles, hence releasing ink for removal.\n[7,14,17]\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 166 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter V | Effect of ultra-high pressure on enzymatic modification of recycled pulp \n\nXylan is a major hemicellulose in hardwood pulps, which can be selectively \n\ndepolymerized by xylanase. This property was successfully used for both hardwood kraft \n\npulps bleaching or upgrading to dissolving pulps.\n[15,18,19]\n\n By breaking the covalent linkages \n\nbetween xylose residues, xylanase is able to hydrolyse xylan into leachable \n\noligosaccharides. The removal of xylan oligosaccharides, together with substituted \n\nhemicelluloses and covalently linked lignin, from the fibre surface, results in improved \n\nbleaching, also due to the enhanced penetration of bleaching agents. \n[20,21]\n\n The use of \n\nxylanases for the treatment of recycled pulps is much less studied than with other \n\nenzymatic systems.\n[14]\n\n \n\nUltra-high hydrostatic pressure (UHP) treatment is a relatively new technique, which \n\nhas demonstrated the ability to reverse the limitations laid on recycled fibres by \n\nhornification due to forced hydration and introduction of strongly bound water in pulp.\n[22]\n\n \n\nUHP treatment prompts rearrangements to the fibre structure, which increase accessibility \n\ntowards chemicals and enzymes.\n[22\u201324]\n\n \n\nConsidering the aforementioned, the main goal of this study was to evaluate the \n\neffect of selective modification of recycled pulp by xylanase, also promoted by UHP pre-\n\ntreatment, on the strength properties of recycled pulp. It is noteworthy that the studies \n\ndescribed in this chapter were published and are thus available for viewing in a journal \n\narticle entitled \u201cHigh pressure-promoted xylanase treatment to enhance papermaking \n\nproperties of recycled pulp\u201d.\n[25]\n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 167 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter V | Effect of ultra-high pressure on enzymatic modification of recycled pulp \n\n5.2.

When the NaOH solution (under stirring and \n\nheating) reached approximately 100 \u00baC, 5 g of DNS were added. Afterwards, when the \n\nmixture approached approximately 60 \u00baC, the tartrate solution was added. The mixture was \n\nleft stirring until all DNS was dissolved. Then it was cooled down and stored. \n\nTo quantify the produced RS, 0.5 mL of a filtered aliquot (in duplicate), collected \n\nduring the enzymatic reactions, was added into o soviril tube. After adding 1 ml of DNS, \n\nthe tube was closed and placed under boiling water (100 \u00baC) for 5 min. The sample was \n\nthen placed on ice to cool down and diluted by adding 10 ml of distilled water. \n\nThe quantification was carried out on a UV-Vis spectrophotometer, Evolution 220 \n\nfrom Thermo Scientific at 540 nm. To all absorbance values, it was subtracted the value of \n\nthe blank, which consisted of buffer solution subjected to the same procedure of samples. \n\nThe calibration curve for RS quantification was performed by applying the described \n\nmethod to glucose standard solutions of 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1, 2 and 3 mg/mL of concentration. \n\nFrom their absorbance values and concentration values, a calibration curve was achieved \n\nand is presented in Appendices C. \n\n5.2.5. Handsheets formation \n\nTo evaluate the physical and mechanical properties of pulp samples, handsheets were \n\nprepared following ISO 5269-2:2004, on a Rapid- K\u00f6then sheet former (Karl Schr\u00f6der \n\nKG). \n\n5.2.6.

Tensile strength, \n\nstretch, tear index, burst index, air resistance (Gurley method) were evaluated following \n\nISO 1924-2:2008, ISO 1974:2012, ISO 2758:2014 and ISO 5636-5:2013, respectively. \n\nBrightness and fluorescence of hand sheets were determined following ISO 2470-1:2009, \n\nusing an Elrepho brightness tester (Lorentzen &amp; Wettre). Water retention value (WRV) \n\nwas determined by centrifuge method based on a procedure developed by Jayme (1958).\n[27]\n\n \n\n \n\n5.2.7. Xylan removal yield \n\nThe xylan removal yield was monitored considering changes on the neutral sugar \n\ncontents (shifts on xylose content) and the weight loss registered for each sample after each \n\ntreatment. \n\nVariations on mass were also followed. With this purpose a microporous filter (no.3) \n\nwas weighted before the reaction, then it was used to filter the reaction medium and, after \n\ndried along with the filtrate at 105 \u00baC (until 0% HR), was weighted again. \n\nThe formula used to calculate the yield is given by equation 4.1. \n\n?????

Results and Discussion \n\nThe effect of UHP on xylanase hydrolysis and modification of recycled fibres, R, \n\nwas studied. Since chemical analysis (Chapter 3, section 3.3.1.) showed similarities \n\nbetween the chemical composition of the selected recycled fibres (R) and virgin eucalypt \n\npulp (E), this last may simulate pulp R, before its involvement in the papermaking process. \n\nHence, E pulp was used here as non-processed virgin fibres for comparative reasons.  \n\n5.3.1. Effect of UHP pre-treatment on the enzymatic treatment of pulp  \n\n5.3.1.1. Reducing sugars release \n\nE and R samples were subjected to UHP pre-treatment under different conditions (0, \n\n300, 400, 500 and 600 MPa, during 10 min) and, after that, were treated with xylanase at \n\n40\u00baC during 75 min. The removal of xylan, by enzymatic hydrolysis, was monitored by the \n\nrelease of reducing sugars (RS), according to the DNS method.\n[26]\n\n The RS release profiles \n\nare displayed in Figure 5. 1 (recycled fibres) and Figure 5. 2 (virgin fibres). For simplicity, \n\neach sample was labelled as described below. R consists of recycled fibres sample, without \n\nUHP pre-treatment and subjected to enzymatic treatment. The other recycled fibres \n\nsamples of recycled fibres subjected to UHP pre-treatment and enzymatic hydrolysis, were \n\nlabelled as \u201cRXXX\u201d, where \u201cXXX\u201d corresponds to the pressure applied during the UHP \n\npre-treatment (300, 400, 500 or 600MPa). The same labelling method was used for virgin \n\nfibres, being E the pulp sample without UHP pre-treatment and subjected to enzymatic \n\ntreatment, while \u201cEXXX\u201d samples consist of pulp samples subjected to both UHP pre-\n\ntreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis. \n\n  \nFigure 5. 1 \u2013 Reducing sugars (RS) release as a function of \n\ntime for recycled pulp (R) subjected to xylanase hydrolysis \n\nafter the UHP treatment at 300MPa (R300), 400MPa \n\n(R400), 500MPa (R500) and 600MPa (R600). \n\nFigure 5. 2 \u2013 Reducing sugars (RS) release as a function of \n\ntime for virgin pulp (E) subjected to xylanase hydrolysis \n\nafter the UHP pre-treatment at 300MPa (E300), 400MPa \n\n(E400), 500MPa (E500) and 600MPa (E600). \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 171 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter V | Effect of ultra-high pressure on enzymatic modification of recycled pulp \n\nIn both types of fibres (recycled and virgin fibres), the increase of RS release was \n\nobserved for samples subjected to UHP pre-treatment, with a sudden rise at ca. 10min. In \n\nopposite, pulps not treated by UHP revealed a slower and continuous release of RS. \n\nFurthermore, it was found that RS release profiles depended on the pressure conditions \n\napplied. \n\nAs regards R (without UHP pre-treatment), this sample released the lowest RS, upon \n\nenzymatic hydrolysis, followed by R300 (recycled fibres treated at 300MPa). Even though \n\nR500 (recycled fibres treated at 500MPa) and R600 (recycled fibres treated at 600MPa) \n\nalso exhibited a higher RS release, when compared with R and R300, it was R400 \n\n(recycled fibres treated with 400MPa) the one displaying the highest RS release (Figure 5. \n\n1). Thus, as showed by RS release, xylan partial removal was promoted by UHP pre-\n\ntreatment.  \n\nXylan removal was particularly fast during the first 2min of enzymatic hydrolysis, \n\nthen further xylan removal from fibre cell wall occurred slowly, especially for pulp fibres \n\nuntreated by UHP (R). These features can be explained by the easy hydrolysis of xylan \n\nfrom fibres surface, whereas the accessibility of interior layer in fibres was significantly \n\nreduced. Nevertheless, even recycled pulp untreated by UHP, R, demonstrated a weak \n\ngrowth of RS release till 60min of enzymatic hydrolysis. This fact may be explained by the \n\nimproved accessibility of beaten R, already used in papermaking, due to the mechanical \n\ndamage/defibration of the fibre cell wall.  \n\nIn the case of virgin hardwood fibres, used for comparative reasons, samples \n\nsubjected to UHP pre-treatment also revealed an increase of RS release, though maximum \n\nRS concentrations in hydrolysates were registered after 500MPa pre-treatment and not \n\nafter 400MPa, as in the case of recycled fibres (Figure 5. 2). The maximum rate of xylan \n\nremoval was associated with the maximum efficiency of enzyme promoted fibre \n\nmodification, with respect to surface purification and accessibility. Xylan removal from E \n\n(monitored by RS release) was stagnant after 10min of enzymatic hydrolysis, possibly due \n\nto hindered accessibility to intact cell wall if virgin fibres (unbeaten fibres).  \n\nAlthough, in both cases, recycled and virgin pulps showed an improved accessibility \n\nto xylanase, after the UHP pre-treatment, the maximum xylan removal was observed for R \n\nand E, under different hydrostatic pressures. Thus, the highest xylan hydrolysis for R was \n\nobserved after UHP pre-treatment at 400MPa and at 500MPa for E. The UHP treatment \n\nleads to forced hydration of cellulosic fibrils in the pulp and to the disaggregation of \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 172 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter V | Effect of ultra-high pressure on enzymatic modification of recycled pulp \n\nmicrofibrils (bundle of fibrils), thus opening the inter-microfibrillar space for enzymatic \n\nattack on the xylan that envelops the cellulose microfibril (Figure 5. 3).\n[24]\n\n  \n\nAlong the UHP pre-treatment in time or when increasing the hydrostatic pressure, the \n\nforced hydration of fibrils inside cellulose microfibrils proceeds, thus decreasing the space \n\nbetween microfibrils due to its enlargement. As a consequence, the accessibility of xylan in \n\ninter-microfibrillar space is diminishing. Apparently, the partially disintegrated cell wall of \n\nR fibres requires less severe hydrostatic pressure to disaggregate cellulose microfibrils than \n\nthe intact cell wall of E fibres. \n\n \n\nFigure 5. 3 - Schematic representation of the effect of ultra-high hydrostatic pressure (UHP) treatment on the \n\nimprovement of fibre cell wall accessibility towards xylanase (ENZ). Forced hydration favours the disaggregation of \n\nmicrofibrils (MCF) and elementary fibrils (EF), thus improving the accessibility of xylan (X) in the inter-microfibrillar \n\nspace. \n\nIt was also suggested that the presence of cellulases in the supplied xylanases was \n\ninsignificant because no decrease was found in the intrinsic viscosity of pulp, after the \n\nenzymatic treatment. In contrast, a small increase it was found from 925cm\n3\n/g (Chapter 3, \n\nTable 3.3) to 940cm\n3\n/g, due to partial elimination of relatively low molecular weight xylan. \n\n5.3.1.2. Physical/Mechanical properties \n\nConsidering the optimum UHP treatment conditions for cellulosic pulps, R \n\n(400MPa) and E (500MPa), hand sheets from its corresponding pulps were prepared to \n\nevaluate the effect of the combination of UHP pre-treatment and enzymatic treatment \n\n(R400E and E500E, respectively). Additionally, for comparison both pulp without any \n\ntreatment (R and E) and those treated solely with enzymes (RE and EE, respectively) or \n\nsolely pre-treated by UHP treatment (RHP and EHP) were also considered (Table 5. 1 and \n\n5.2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 173 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter V | Effect of ultra-high pressure on enzymatic modification of recycled pulp \n\nTable 5. 1- Mechanical properties of the recycled fibres (R) upon enzymatic and high pressure treatments. \n\nSamples R RHP ?

In the case of recycled fibres solely treated with xylanase (RE), most of the physical \n\nproperties were improved, which were further boosted upon UHP treatment (R400E). \n\nAlthough UHP pre-treatment itself did not improve significantly the physical properties of \n\nR (RHP), UHP certainly had a synergistic effect on those properties when combined with \n\nposterior enzymatic treatment. This is especially notable for tensile strength and the tear \n\nresistance, as evidenced from analyses on RE and R400E, which were improved up to \n\n30%. The air resistance was also superior for enzyme-treated pulp demonstrating paper \n\nstructure closure due to improved fibre-fibre interaction. Such features may be related both \n\nto the enhanced accessibility of R fibres towards xylanase and by forced hydration and \n\nfavourable rearrangement of cellulosic fibrils in fibres after UHP pre-treatment. As it was \n\npreviously suggested, UHP treatment leads to disaggregation of fibrils by forced hydration \n\nof their surface and to rearrangements of cellulose fibrils, leading to crystallite aggregation \n\nand diminishing of the distortion of their surfaces.\n[22]\n\n All these changes promote the fibre \n\nbonding capacity and increased intrinsic fibre strength. UHP treatment of cellulosic fibres \n\nalso leads to the increase of strongly bound water in pulp, thus diminishing its \n\nsusceptibility to hornification.\n[22]\n\n \n\nThe significantly increased drainability of enzyme-modified pulp (RE) evidenced for \n\nthe improved swelling capacity of recycled pulp, though this was not accompanied by the \n\nincreasing of WRVs due to the removal of hydrophilic xylan from pulp. It is suggested that \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 174 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter V | Effect of ultra-high pressure on enzymatic modification of recycled pulp \n\nthe partial removal of xylan, bound to impurities and to cellulose fibrils, on the surface of \n\nrecycled pulp, would favour the ensuing swelling and inter-fibre bonding of purified R \n\nfibres in handsheets. This is a reason for the notable improvement of mechanical properties \n\nof R, after the enzymatic treatment (Table 5. 1). The increased drainability, after the \n\nenzymatic treatment, indicates that RE might possess much better refinability than the \n\ninitial R (Table 5. 1). This is an attractive point for economic manufacture of paper from \n\nrecycled fibres since the energy costs for pulp refining are the main expensive item of \n\npaper production. \n\nIn contrast to strength parameters, a small decrease in recycled pulp brightness was \n\nobserved after enzymatic treatment. These features are also demonstrated by reflectance \n\nspectra of paper sheets in the range of 200-450nm (Figure 5. 4). The decrease in recycled \n\npulp reflection at 475nm was correlated with the loss of calcium carbonate filler, under \n\nweakly acidic conditions, after the enzymatic treatments. In parallel tests it was observed \n\nthat when pulp R was treated solely with buffer (pH 5), the reflection at 475nm would \n\ndecrease nearly 1.2%. From the other side, the decrease in R brightness after enzymatic \n\ntreatment may also be explained by the eventual removal of optical brightening agents \n\n(OBAs) present in printing papers. This fact was evidenced by the detected decrease in \n\nfluorescence R457 of the treated recycled pulp (Table 5. 1). The removal of OBAs is a \n\ntypical feature for recycled pulps modified by enzymatic treatment.\n[28,29]\n\n However, the \n\nunexpected increase of K/S in the UV-vis DR spectra range of 220-350nm from R to RE \n\nand further to R400E (Figure 5. 4) was possibly the result of detachment of impurities \n\n(printing inks, auxiliary resins, etc) not only from the surface but also from the bulk of \n\nfibres, which under the treatment conditions, formed small dispersed particles that re-\n\nadsorbed further on fibre surface. Such explanation was suggested in previous studies on \n\nthe enzymatically promoted deinking of recycled pulps.\n[29,30]\n\n According to literature,\n[30]\n\n the \n\nenzymatic treatment of alkaline paper (formed at pH 8-9) under weak acidic conditions, \n\nusually leads to the appearance of floating microparticles of toner/ink liberated as the result \n\nof its release from degraded calcium carbonate particles and inaccessible fibre surface. \n\nThese ink microparticles tend to re-precipitate on fibres in the absence of appropriate \n\nsurfactants, thus decreasing the pulp brightness. Apparently, forced hydration of pulp upon \n\nUHP treatment facilitates not only the enzyme penetration inside the cellulosic fibres, but \n\nalso the detachment of impurities from the surface. This explains the highest increase of \n\nK/S in the UV-vis DR spectrum of R400E, which is in agreement with a more pronounced \n\nenzymatic accessibility of pulp, due to UHP pre-treatment (Figure 5. 1). \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 175 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter V | Effect of ultra-high pressure on enzymatic modification of recycled pulp \n\n \n\nFigure 5. 4 \u2013 UV-vis reflectance spectra of handsheets prepared from recycled fibres (R), recycled fibres solely treated by \n\nenzymatic treatment (RE) and recycled fibres subjected to UHP pre-treatment and enzymatic treatment (R400E). \n\nTable 5. 2 - Mechanical properties of virgin hardwood pulp (E) upon enzymatic and high pressure treatments. \n\nSamples E EHP ?

Similar to R pulp, enzymatic treatment of pulp E led to a significant \n\nimprovement of pulp strength properties being the most noticeable tensile strength and tear \n\nindex. Again, it was found that pulp samples subjected to enzymatic treatment after UHP \n\n(E500E) exhibited much better results than those without UHP pre-treatment (EE). The \n\nrelative improvement of strength properties for virgin pulp, observed after the UHP pre-\n\ntreatment followed by enzymatic hydrolysis (E500E), was even higher than that for the \n\nrecycled pulp after the same treatments (R400E). (Figure 5. 2). This can be explained, at \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 176 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter V | Effect of ultra-high pressure on enzymatic modification of recycled pulp \n\nleast partially, by the higher strength of virgin pulp fibres, comparatively to recycled ones, \n\ndue to the less degraded pulp polysaccharides in the former. In fact, the intrinsic viscosity \n\nof E was almost twice to R (Chapter 3, Table 3.3). \n\nNevertheless, in relative terms, UHP pre-treatment was more advantageous for pulp \n\nR, than for pulp E. At the same time, unlike pulp R, UHP did not affect the drainability of \n\npulp E (Table 5. 2). This may be explained, from one side by moderate enzymatic \n\nhydrolysis of virgin pulp and from the other side, by difficulties in swelling of fibres with \n\nintact primary cell walls.\n[31]\n\n Nevertheless, the WRV of E subjected to enzymatic treatment \n\nincreased remarkably, thus indicating the enhanced internal swelling of pulp fibres. Also, \n\nin opposite to pulp R, an enzymatic treatment of pulp E showed a small increase in pulp \n\nbrightness (ca. 0.5% ISO) and no changes in fluorescence R457 (Table 5. 2). \n\n5.3.1.3. SEM \n\nThe changes in pulp fibre morphology due to the enzymatic treatment, with and \n\nwithout UHP pre-treatment, were evaluated by image analysis using SEM. Figure 5. 5 \n\ndisplays the SEM images acquired from samples R, RE and R400E, while Figure 5. 6 \n\nexhibits the SEM images of samples E, EE and E500E.  \n\nThe images of recycled fibres, R, (Figure 5. 5a) exhibited damaged/defibrillated cell \n\nwalls, which confirms that fibres from recycled pulp were previously beaten in \n\npapermaking, as proposed in section 5.3.1.1. \n\nThe effect of xylanase on fibres can be observed when comparing R (Figure 5. 5a) \n\nwith RE (Figure 5. 5b) and E (Figure 5. 6a) with EE (Figure 5. 6b). The external \n\nfibrillation of fibres induced by xylanase was visualised, as well as the diminishing of \n\nfibre surface collapse, especially for the recycled pulp. Visually, enzymatically treated \n\nfibres are better intertwined and possess higher contact areas than non-treated fibres. This \n\nbecomes even more noticeable when comparing enzymatically modified fibres without \n\n(RE and EE) and with UHP pre-treatment (R500E and E400E) (Figure 5. 5c and Figure \n\n5. 6c, respectively). \n\n \n\nFigure 5. 5 - SEM image of recycled fibres, R, (a); recycled fibres treated solely with xylanase, RE, (b); and recycled \n\nfibres treated with UHP followed by xylanase treatment, R400E, (c). \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 177 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter V | Effect of ultra-high pressure on enzymatic modification of recycled pulp \n\n \n\nFigure 5. 6 - SEM image of E. globulus fibres, E, (a); E fibres treated solely with xylanase, EE, (b); and E fibres treated \n\nwith UHP followed by xylanase treatment E500E, (c). \n\n5.3.1.4.

The amount of xylan removed from \n\nthe recycled pulp was roughly twice of that observed for the virgin pulp, which can be \n\nexplained by the higher accessibility of the former, due to structural disintegration of fibres \n\nafter beating during paper production and because of paper life cycle (e.g. abrasion, folding \n\nand ageing). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 178 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter V | Effect of ultra-high pressure on enzymatic modification of recycled pulp \n\n5.4. Conclusions \n\nThe employment of UHP pre-treatment on recycled fibres allowed an improved \n\nremoval of xylan in a xylanase-catalysed treatment. UHP pre-treatment promoted forced \n\nhydration of fibrils and the disaggregation of microfibrils, which ensued the opening of \n\ninter-fibrillar space for enzymatic attack. Due to improved accessibility enzymes were able \n\nto remove xylan more efficiently. This was demonstrated for both recycled and virgin \n\nfibres, for comparison, in terms of reducing sugars release and mass balance.  \n\nMoreover, although both fibres showed improved enzymatic accessibility the \n\noptimum pressure condition of UHP pre-treatment were different (400MPa for R and \n\n500MPa for E). It was suggested that due to the damaged cell wall of R, this last required \n\nless severe hydrostatic pressure to disaggregate cellulose microfibrils than E (unbeaten \n\nvirgin fibres with intact cell wall). \n\nIt was also demonstrated that the partial removal of xylan enabled the improvement \n\nof strength properties on both pulps, which were further improved when pulps were pre-\n\ntreated by UHP treatment (more efficient enzymatic hydrolysis). Also, recycled fibres \n\nimproved drainability suggest a better refinability, which is indicative of energy savings, as \n\nregards pulp refining in papermaking. \n\nThe results achieved also demonstrated the importance of pH conditions, close to \n\nneutral, during the enzymatic treatment. It was found that this was important to avoid the \n\ndissolution of fillers such as calcium carbonate, and thus avoid a decrease in brightness. \n\nNevertheless, UHP pre-treatment revealed a favoured elimination of concomitant \n\nimpurities, such as OBA, residual inks and auxiliary reagents in recycled pulp. However, \n\nunder the treatment conditions (mild acidic pH without surfactants) the re-precipitation of \n\nimpurities together with the loss of OBAs contributed for the decrease of recycled fibres \n\nbrightness. Which was not the case of virgin pulp (increase of ca 0.5% ISO). \n\nAs main conclusion, it is suggested that the modification of hardwood-purified \n\nbleached recycled pulp by xylanase treatment was a very efficient tool for improving its \n\npapermaking properties. However, further studies are required on the development of \n\npapermaking properties during beating of the recycled pulp subjected to enzymatic \n\ntreatment at variable xylanase loads, including the use of industrially produced enzymes \n\nand on the evaluation of economic feasibility of recycled pulp modification by \n\nUHP/enzymatic treatment. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 179 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter V | Effect of ultra-high pressure on enzymatic modification of recycled pulp \n\n5.5.

Introduction \n\nThe competition in tissue paper market has stimulated the development of new \n\nproducts, more appealing to consumer, such as coloured papers. This approach of \n\nappealing to consumer\u2019s senses, by using a colour coding, or as a way of brand \n\nidentification,\n[1,2]\n\n has led companies, such as Renova, to differentiate themselves from \n\ncompetition, for example in tissue paper market (e.g. Renova black toilet paper). The class \n\nof chemicals responsible for conferring colour to papers are dyes. This ancient class of \n\nadditives are employed not only in paper industry, but also, and at a much larger scale, on \n\ntextiles. \n[1\u20133]\n\n Dyes account for 5% of the specialty chemicals applied to paper. These \n\ncolourants are added to paper stock at the preparation stage, to produce distinguished \n\ncoloured papers.\n[1,2,4]\n\n \n\nThe selection of a suitable dye for paper coloration depends, for instance, on its end-\n\nuse requirements, physical and chemical properties, and handling characteristics. Paper \n\ndyeing aims to produce paper with a desired colour or shade, although the dyeing process \n\nitself can be a rather complex one. \n[1,2]\n\n Several issues arise during pulp dyeing, some \n\nrelated with the interference of process variables, when dyes react differently with different \n\nfurnishes, or due to the interaction of dyes with other additives (mostly by electrostatic \n\ninteraction). \n[1,2,5]\n\n At the same time, some other parameters should be taken into \n\nconsideration. For example, the fastness properties, which are of utter importance for high \n\nquality writing or tissue papers (e.g. paper in contact with food should exhibit insignificant \n\nor non-existent bleeding). Other properties include light fastness properties, toxicity and \n\nthe environmental impact of the dyed product. \n[2]\n\n \n\nIn paper dyeing, direct dyes (anionic and cationic) as well as acidic and basic are the \n\nmost widely used. Nevertheless, direct dyes occupy a central role in paper dying.\n[1,4,6,7]\n\n \n\nDuring the dying process dyes penetrate into fibres and interact with them. Considering the \n\ntype of dyes, the established bonds may be intermolecular hydrogen interactions or \n\nelectrostatic interactions. A dye molecule may also be precipitated on the fibre surface. In \n\ncase of anionic direct dyes (used by Renova), those may interact with cellulosic fibres \n\nthrough Van der Wall forces and hydrogen bonds. Also, the aggregation ability with fibres \n\nmay play a central role on the dye fixation. Due to the anionic nature of both direct anionic \n\ndyes and cellulose, in most cases a fixative agent (e.g. cationic fixatives) is used to enhance \n\ndye fixation (dye adsorption on fibres), in order to achieve an efficient dyeing process. \n\nAn efficient dye fixation is a rather relevant issue in coloured tissue paper \n\nproduction, since it is translated not only into a strongly coloured product (higher \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 186 ~ \n\n  \n\n Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes \n\nretention/fixation), but also in the product fastness properties and effluents managements \n\n(coloured backwaters, increased chemical oxygen demand, etc.). \n[1,4,5]\n\n \n\nUltra-high pressure technology (UHP) emerges here as a potential prospective \n\ntechnology, to improve the dyeing of cellulosic fibres due to improved accessibility. The \n\nstructural changes induced on fibres by UHP treatment, such as, disaggregation of \n\nmicrofibrils and forced hydration should increase accessible surface and diminish zeta \n\npotential of fibrils (two factors favouring dye fixation). The improved accessibility on \n\ncellulosic fibres has been demonstrated, in previous studies, towards chemicals and \n\nenzymes.\n[8\u201310]\n\n With this in mind, this study was focused on application of UHP treatment \n\nin the impregnation of fibres with dyes, commonly used by Renova for the tissue paper, \n\nand limiting the coloured paper production. The effect of dye fixation/retention, along with \n\nits fastness properties (namely bleedfastness) were evaluated. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 187 ~ \n\n  \n\n Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes \n\n6.2. Materials and Methods \n\nContrarily to the previous chapter, the raw material used in these studies was virgin \n\nhardwood pulp. This raw material was used as reference to avoid irregularities coming \n\nfrom the variability of recycled pulps lots. Such approach is justified from an academic \n\npoint of view. Therefore, Eucalyptus globulus bleached kraft industrial pulp, E, kindly \n\nsupplied by Renova FPA, S.A. was used as reference raw material for the dyeing studies. \n\nThe dyes and fixative agent tested, also supplied by Renova, were the following: \n\n? Pergasol\n\u00ae\n Black GN-E (BASF, direct anionic dye, powder, azo dye) \n\n? Pergasol\n\u00ae\n Red 7BE (BASF, direct anionic dye, powder, diazo dye) \n\n? Pergasol\n\u00ae\n Violet BN-TKZ (BASF, direct anionic dye, liquid, diazo dye) \n\n? Pergasol\n\u00ae \n\n2G-Z (BASF, direct anionic dyes, liquid, azo dye) \n\n? Cartasol Blue 3R-EU (Clariant, direct anionic dye, liquid, azo dye) \n\n? Synthro\n\u00ae\n\u2013 Fix WF (Prox, cationic resin, 50% dry weight) \n\n \n\n6.2.1. Preliminary tests with Pergasol Red 7BE and Pergasol Black GNE  \n\n? Propylene Glycol (96%, Dowcal) \n\n? Distilled water \n\nPreliminary tests performed with Renova dyes (Pergasol Red 7BE and Pergasol \n\nBlack GN-E), aimed to evaluate UHP abilities improving dye impregnation and fixation on \n\npulp.  \n\nSince at this point the UHP equipment with higher capacity was not yet available, \n\ndue to the limited capacity of the available one, and thus the insufficient amount of sample \n\nto produce standard handsheets, smaller handsheets were prepared under an adapted \n\nprocedure. The small handsheets were prepared in laboratory through filtration, with a \n\nporous glass filter (no.3, \u00d8=60 mm). Firstly, 2%, 1% and 0.5% (w/v) of dye solutions \n\n(Pergasol Red 7BE and Pergasol Black GN-E) were prepared, together with a fixative \n\n(Synthro \u2013 Fix) solution of 0.05% (w/v). Pulp was weighted (1 g) and then dispersed in \n\n100 mL of cationic resin solution. The dispersion was allowed to stir during 5 min for \n\ninteraction with fibres and was then filtered. To the filtered pulp 44 mL of dye solution \n\nwas added. Then, after the homogenization of the pulp dispersion, samples meant for UHP \n\ntreatment were placed on plastic bags, vacuum sealed, and subjected to UHP treatment \n\n(400 MPa, 15 min), whereas non-treated samples were subjected to stirring for 15 min \n\n(reference). \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 188 ~ \n\n  \n\n Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes \n\nThe UHP treatment was performed using a High Pressure U33 device (Institute of \n\nHigh Pressure Physics, Poland), with a high pressure vessel of approximately 100 cm\n3\n \n\ncapacity, filled with a pressure transmitting medium (propylene glycol:water, 1:1, v/v). \n\nAfter impregnation, the coloured pulp suspensions were diluted up to 100 mL, with \n\ndistilled water, homogenized and separated into equal dispersions of 20 mL. Each solution \n\n(20 mL x 0.2 g of pulp) was used to prepare small paper sheets by filtration through a glass \n\nporous filter. The wet paper sheets were collected and left drying on aluminium sheets \n\novernight (~70 g/m\n2\n). When dried, all paper sheets were evaluated on its smooth side with \n\na CM-2300d spectrometer from Konica Minolta to access the colour intensity. \n\n6.2.1.1. Optimization of UHP conditions (pressure and time) \n\nThese tests were carried out to perceive the UHP conditions (pressure and time) most \n\nadvantageous for the pulp dyeing process. The used protocol was similar to that described \n\nin section 6.2.1, although with small differences. The dye concentration was fixed at 1% \n\n(w/v). The tested dyes were Pergasol Black GN-E and Pergasol Red 7BE, at different UHP \n\nconditions 300 MPa (10, 20, 30 min), 400MPa (10, 20, 30 min) and 500 MPa (5, 10, 15 \n\nmin). The UHP treatment was performed at the same equipment as described in section \n\n6.2.1. The procedure for paper sheets preparation was also the same as employed before \n\nand described in 6.2.1. When dried, handsheets were evaluated on its smooth side with a \n\nCM-2300d spectrometer from Konica Minolta. \n\n6.2.2. Determination of the optimum fixative load (OFL)  \n\nDue to the difficulties found for dyes fixation on pulp from relatively concentrated \n\ndye solutions, a new protocol was used, kindly suggested by Renova, to enable the \n\ndetermination of the amount of fixative required for an optimized dye fixation. The \n\ndetermination of the optimum fixative load (OFL), was determined considering an \n\napproximation of Renova norm PT.LAB.613, without UHP treatment, for the following \n\ndyes: Pergasol Black GN-E, Pergasol Red 7BE, Pergasol Violet BN-TKZ, Pergasol\n \n2G-Z \n\nand Cartasol Blue 3R-EU.  \n\nPulp suspensions of 16 g/L concentration were prepared by dispersing 0.4 g of pulp \n\n(dry weight) in 25 mL of distilled water. Each sample was then treated according to \n\nconditions presented in Table 6. 1. For these trials solutions of 2% (w/v) of dye and \n\nfixative were used. The required volume was calculated based on Table 6. 1 information. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 189 ~ \n\n  \n\n Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes \n\nTable 6. 1\u2013 Determination of the optimum fixative load (RENOVA PT.LAB.613). \n\nLoad \nFixative \n\n(%)(wfixative/wpulp) \nStirring \n\nDye \n\n(%)(wdye/wpulp) \nStirring \n\nFixative \n\n(%)(wfixative/wpulp) \nStirring \n\n1 0 \n\n1min 3 3min \n\n0 \n\n1min \n\n2 0.10 0.65 \n\n3 0.20 1.50 \n\n4 0.30 2.20 \n\n5 0.40 2.60 \n\n6 0.50 3.00 \n\nFollowing the protocol described in Table 6. 1, each pulp suspension was diluted up \n\nto 100 mL, homogenised and divided into two equal dispersions of 50 mL each. These \n\nwere further filtered on a glass porous filter (no.3, \u00d8=60 mm) and left drying on \n\naluminium sheets overnight. When dried all paper sheets were evaluated on its smooth side \n\nwith a CM-2300d spectrometer from Konica Minolta. The OFL values determined for each \n\ndye were compared with typical OFL values determined on Renova quality control, to \n\nverify any eventual differences in the results obtained. \n\n6.2.2.1. Effect of UHP on fixative load variations \n\nAfter determining the load of fixative required to achieve an optimum dye fixation, \n\nfurther tests after UHP treatment of pulp were conducted. These trials were carried out on a \n\nnew 55L capacity equipment (high pressure apparatus, model 55 Hyperbaric). Since larger \n\nscale assays were possible, this enabled the production of standard handsheets on Renova \n\nfacilities, in agreement with Renova norm PT.Lab.613. \n\nUsing the same dyes as in section 6.2.2. (Pergasol Black GN-E, Pergasol Red 7BE, \n\nPergasol Violet BN-TKZ, Pergasol\n \n2G-Z, and Cartasol Blue 3R-EU), and also considering \n\neach dye OFL (determined following section 6.2.2), each sample was prepared individually \n\nin amounts enough to allow handsheet preparation on Renova\u2019s Rapid-K\u00f6then sheet \n\nformer (Karl Schr\u00f6der KG). \n\nIn a typical experimental set pulp dispersions of 16 g/L concentration were prepared \n\n(2 g \u2013 125 mL) with a dye load of 3% (wdye/wpulp). The dye and the fixative were applied \n\nfollowing the order indicated in Table 6. 1, from 2% (w/v) dye and fixative solutions, \n\nprepared beforehand.  \n\nOne set of samples was subjected to UHP (500 MPa, 10 min, in aqueous medium), \n\nwhile the other (reference) was just subjected to stirring. Then, both samples were used to \n\nprepare (~60 g/m\n2\n). The effect of UHP on the dye fixation, by removing certain \n\npercentages of fixative, was also evaluated. These tests aimed to verify the UHP effect on a \n\ndye fixation, thus allowing the savings of fixative. Three types of samples were prepared, \n\nwhile reducing fixative by 5, 10 and 15% in relation to the expected amounts as indicated \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 190 ~ \n\n  \n\n Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes \n\nin Table 6. 1. Each sample was also subjected to UHP (500 MPa, 10 min) or stirred only \n\nfor comparative reasons (reference sample). The produced samples were used to prepare \n\nstandard handsheets, and then were evaluated using a spectrometer from Konica Minolta, \n\nmodel CM-2300d. \n\n6.2.3. Determination of fixative optimum load (OFL) after UHP treatment \n\nThe effect of UHP on the dye-fixative-substrate equilibrium was also studied (norm \n\nPT.Lab.613). Five sets of pulp suspensions of 16 g/L concentration (2 g x 125 mL each) \n\nwere prepared and treated according with the steps described on Table 6. 1. Afterwards \n\nsamples were vacuum sealed in HDPE flasks and subjected to UHP (500 MPa, 10 min \u2013 \n\nequipment model 55, Hyperbaric). The resultant samples were then used to produce \n\nstandard handsheets on a Rapid-K\u00f6then sheet former, for colour evaluation. The coloured \n\nhandsheets were analysed on spectrometer from Konica Minolta, model CM-2300d. \n\n6.2.4. Dye savings study \n\nPergasol Red 7BE was selected as a case study to evaluate the \n\ndifferences/similarities existing between different colour levels upon UHP treatment. The \n\nmain purpose was to evaluate the ability of UHP to promote the dyeing of pulp fibres, thus \n\nsaving the dye stock. Accordingly, 16 g/L pulp suspensions were prepared and dyed using \n\nPergasol Red 7BE, with 3% (w/w) of dye load. Here the fixative and dye loads were those \n\nas in Table 6. 1 and Table 6. 2. The amount of fixative added was in agreement with the \n\nOFL UHP pre-determined as described in section 6.2.3. (fixative concentration no. 6 for \n\nPergasol Red 7BE). Afterwards, samples were subjected to UHP (500 MPa, 10 min) and \n\nused to produce handsheets. For comparative reasons, pulp samples dyed with 3 and 4% \n\n(wdye/wpulp) dye concentration were also prepared. In these cases, the fixative amount \n\nadded was in agreement with the OFL determined without UHP (fixative concentration no. \n\n4 for Pergasol Red 7BE). \n\nTable 6. 2 \u2013 Dye charges versus fixative loadings. \n\nDye load (%) \n\n(wdye/wpulp) \n\nFixative (%) (wfixative/wpulp) \n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 \n\ninitial final initial final initial final initial final initial final initial final \n\n3.00 0.000 0.000 0.100 0.650 0.200 1.500 0.300 2.200 0.400 2.600 0.500 3.000 \n\n4.00 0.000 0.000 0.100 0.900 0.200 1.800 0.300 2.700 0.400 3.600 0.500 4.500 \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 191 ~ \n\n  \n\n Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes \n\n6.2.5.

Firstly, two sheets of unstained glass fibre paper (dimension \n\n60 mmx45 mm) were immersed in a test fluid and removed after saturation. The excess \n\nfluid was removed.

Results and Discussion \n\nAs previously depicted the impregnation studies with dyes were performed using \n\nsolely using virgin hardwood fibres as reference raw material to avoid irregularities \n\ncoming from different lots of recycled pulps.  \n\n6.3.1. Preliminary tests  \n\nPreliminary tests with two dyes supplied by Renova were performed as described in \n\nsection 6.2.1. These tests aimed to study differences that could emerge by employing UHP \n\ntreatment on fibres dyeing process. The dyes selected were the two of the most problematic \n\nfor Renova, Pergasol Red 7BE and Pergasol Black GN-E. The conditions applied were \n\nstandard UHP conditions, used in previous assays (400 MPa, 15 min). For each dye, three \n\nsets of pulp samples (treated in advance with fixative agent) were impregnated with 2, 1 \n\nand 0.5% (wdye/vsolution) dye solutions. Since at this stage the pilot UHP equipment of high \n\ncapacity (55 L) was not yet available, and due to the low capacity (100 mL) of the existing \n\none, the produced paper sheets were prepared by filtration of a diluted and homogenous \n\ndispersion of each sample, yielding handsheets with approximately 70 g/m\n2\n.  \n\nThe colorimetric and spectral data from each sample, namely L*a*b, and K/S(?max) \n\n(measurement of intensity/concentration), respectively, were collected and are presented in \n\nTable 6. 4 and 6. 5. For simplicity, in both cases, samples treated with UHP were labelled \n\n\u201cX% with UHP\u201d, while untreated samples were labelled \u201cX% without UHP\u201d, where X% is \n\nthe concentration of the dye solution used in the dyeing process. \n\nIn Table 6. 4 it possible to observe the results achieved for samples impregnated with \n\nPergasol Red 7BE. In this case, samples revealed higher K/S after UHP treatment, than in \n\nthe assay without UHP, which imply an improved dye penetration and fixation on \n\ncellulosic fibres. From the L*a*b coordinates the differences in colour between untreated \n\nand UHP treated samples (?E) were determined. All UHP treated samples exhibited clear \n\ncolour differences, being the most significant achieved for samples dyed with the lowest \n\ndye load (with 0.5% (w/v) dye solution). The set of samples impregnated with 2% (w/v) \n\nexhibited a ?E between 1 and 2, meaning that the colour difference was small, only \n\nperceptible to experienced observers (Table 2. 6, Chapter 2).\n[11]\n\n . Additionally, both \n\nsamples sets impregnated with 0.5% (w/v) and 1% (w/v), exhibited a ?E between 2 and \n\n3.5, which imply a perceivable colour difference between non-treated and UHP treated \n\nsamples.  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 194 ~ \n\n  \n\n Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes \n\nBoth colorimetric and spectral data suggest higher colour intensities in UHP treated \n\nsamples, which imply a higher dye fixation. As demonstrated in previous chapters and in \n\nthe literature,\n[8\u201310]\n\n UHP treatment promotes forced hydration of fibrils, yielding their \n\ndisaggregation and improved accessibility. In this case, the use of UHP treatment, for dye \n\nimpregnation, has enabled a more efficient penetration of dye molecules, with fixative \n\nagent molecules, into the fibrillary structure, than without the application of UHP. As \n\nresult an increased amount of dye molecules were retained, yielding higher colour \n\nintensity. \n\nTable 6. 4 \u2013 Colorimetric and spectral data collected for samples dyed with Pergasol Red 7BE. \n\nDye Sample K/S(?max) L* a* b* Colour ?E* \n\nPergasol Red 7BE \n\n*0.5% without UHP 4.17\u00b10.18 51.77\u00b10.30 48.42\u00b10.23 -5.47\u00b10.12 \n 3.05 \n\n0.5% with UHP 5.24\u00b10.20 49.19\u00b10.27 49.98\u00b10.28 -4.74\u00b10.10 \n \n\n*1% without UHP 7.94\u00b10.30 44.67\u00b10.31 52.19\u00b10.18 -1.68\u00b10.15 \n \n\n2.46 \n\n1% with UHP 9.46\u00b10.31 42.61\u00b10.25 52.58\u00b10.19 -0.4\u00b10.20 \n \n\n*2% without UHP 11.89\u00b10.20 39.43\u00b10.31 51.8\u00b10.18 2.3\u00b10.15 \n \n\n1.82 \n\n2% with UHP 13.53\u00b10.23 38.02\u00b10.28 51.91\u00b10.15 3.44\u00b10.18 \n \n\n *?E determined for each UHP processed sample in comparison to sample dyed without UHP. \n\nIn the case of Pergasol Black GN-E (Table 6. 5) a slightly different behaviour was \n\nregistered. Upon UHP, samples impregnated with 0.5% (w/v) dye solution displayed a \n\nslightly lower K/S, while, on the other hand, samples impregnated with 1 and 2% (w/v) dye \n\nsolutions displayed higher K/S after the UHP treatment. These differences, relatively to \n\nPergasol Red 7BE, suggest that the differences existing between both dye molecules \n\nstructure affect the interaction between dye and cellulose. From the colour coordinates the \n\n?E values were also determined. The samples treated with the lowest dye concentration \n\nexhibited a value of 3.42, which is in the range of perceivable colour difference, towards a \n\nless intense colouration. On the other hand, other samples, treated by UHP, registered \n\nsome improvements in dyeing. In the case of 1 and 2% (w/v) load of the dye a ?E of 1.44 \n\nand 0.85 (only perceivable to experienced observers), were registered, respectively. \n\nAlthough, in some cases, UHP treatment revealed enhanced impregnation, as \n\nexpected, the variation found suggests changes on the fixation process related, possibly, \n\nwith the differences existing between the molecular structures of the two dyes.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 195 ~ \n\n  \n\n Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes \n\nTable 6. 5 - Colorimetric and spectral data collected for samples dyed with Pergasol Black GN-E. \n\nDye Sample K/S(?max) L* a* b* Colour ?E* \n\nPergasol Black GN-E \n\n*0.5% without UHP 9.03\u00b10.23 31.18\u00b10.21 -2.52\u00b10.15 -4.07\u00b10.17 \n 3.42 \n\n0.5% with UHP 8.59\u00b10.20 34.4\u00b10.23 -3.58\u00b10.20 -4.5\u00b10.16 \n \n\n*1% without UHP 11.50\u00b10.10 27.47\u00b10.30 -2.46\u00b10.18 -3.58\u00b10.30 \n \n\n1.44 \n1% with UHP 11.59\u00b10.11 28.8\u00b10.29 -2.91\u00b10.17 -3.89\u00b10.29 \n\n \n\n*2% without UHP 13.28\u00b10.41 23.87\u00b10.45 -1.38\u00b10.15 -2.37\u00b10.32 \n 0.85 \n\n2% with UHP 13.59\u00b10.42 24.46\u00b10.41 -1.82\u00b10.13 -2.80\u00b10.35 \n \n\n*?E determined for each UHP processed sample in comparison to sample dyed without UHP. \n\n6.3.1.1. Effect of UHP conditions \n\nThe most advantageous UHP conditions (pressure and time) for the impregnation \n\nprocess with dyes were also studied. Dyeing tests were performed as described before \n\n(section 6.3.1.), with Pergasol Red 7BE and Pergasol Black GN-E, for fixed dye load \n\n(pulps were impregnated with a 1% (w/v) dye solution) at different time (10-30 min) and \n\npressure conditions (300-500 MPa). \n\nThe colorimetric and spectral data acquired from each sample are presented in Table \n\n6. 6 for samples dyed with Pergasol Red 7BE, and in Table 6. 7 for samples dyed with \n\nPergasol Black GN-E. As concerns Pergasol Red 7BE, (Table 6. 6) it is possible to observe \n\nthat an increase in pressure and time of UHP treatment led to an increase of K/S in treated \n\npulps. Although, considering the acquired data, the conditions conveying higher K/S were \n\n300 MPa/20 min, followed by 400 MPa/30 min and 500 MPa/10 min. \n\nSimilarly, to Pergasol Red 7BE, the results for Pergasol Black GN-E (Table 6. 7) \n\nalso demonstrated that longer pressurization times and higher pressure conditions applied, \n\nresulted in higher K/S values. The best results, in terms of K/S, were achieved for 500 MPa \n\nand 10 min of pressurization. \n\nHowever, considering time as a relevant factor in pulp processing, and the data \n\nobtained from the studies of both dyes, 500 MPa and 10 min were selected as the optimum \n\nconditions, due to the highest K/S values achieved with both dyes (measurement of colour \n\ndensity on fibres). The values of (K/S) are also frequently used at Renova Laboratories as \n\ncriteria for the selection of optimum conditions. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 196 ~ \n\n  \n\n Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes \n\nTable 6. 6 \u2013 Colorimetric and spectral data acquired for Pergasol Red 7BE samples, dyed at different conditions. \n\nDye Pressure conditions K/S (?max) L* a* b* Colour ?E* \n\nPergasol Red 7BE \n\n(1%(w/v)) \n\nWithout UHP 9.87\u00b10.11 44.67\u00b10.20 52.19\u00b10.12 -1.68\u00b10.11 \n \n\n- \n\n300MPa,10min 10.68\u00b10.05 42.55\u00b10.09 53.18\u00b10.13 -0.14\u00b10.15 \n \n\n2.80 \n\n300MPa, 20min 11.13\u00b10.30 41.4\u00b10.37 52.94\u00b10.12 0.79\u00b10.35 \n \n\n4.67 \n\n300MPa, 30min 9.99\u00b10.23 40.45\u00b10.25 52.29\u00b10.23 1.57\u00b10.14 \n \n\n5.33 \n\n400MPa, 10min 10.11\u00b10.12 42.27\u00b10.34 52.88\u00b10.19 0.17\u00b10.30 \n \n\n3.11 \n\n400MPa, 20min 9.93\u00b10.33 42.2\u00b10.34 53.08\u00b10.18 0.29\u00b10.19 \n \n\n3.28 \n\n400MPa, 30min 10.86\u00b10.17 42.66\u00b10.21 53.4\u00b10.18 -0.18\u00b10.12 \n \n\n2.78 \n\n500MPa, 5min 10.18\u00b10.15 41.39\u00b10.30 53.14\u00b10.29 0.98\u00b10.30 \n \n\n4.33 \n\n500MPa, 10min 10.73\u00b10.59 42.09\u00b10.76 53.00\u00b10.25 0.39\u00b10.83 \n \n\n3.41 \n\n500MPa, 15min 9.87\u00b10.45 41.29\u00b10.46 52.74\u00b10.20 1.00\u00b10.29 \n \n\n4.35 \n\n*?E determined for each UHP processed sample in comparison to sample dyed without UHP. \n\nTable 6. 7 - Colorimetric and spectral data acquired for Pergasol Black GN-E samples, dyed at different conditions. \n\nDye \nPressure \n\nconditions \nK/S (?max) L* a* b* Colour ?E \n\nPergasol Black \n\nGN-E \n\n*Without UHP 11,44\u00b10.12 27.47\u00b10.30 -2.46\u00b10.15 -3.58\u00b10.13 \n \n\n- \n\n300MPa,10min 10,11\u00b10.36 28.43\u00b10.54 -2.15\u00b10.14 -4.72\u00b10.17 \n \n\n1.52 \n\n300MPa, 20min 10,43\u00b10.09 28.07\u00b10.21 -2.15\u00b10.10 -4.82\u00b10.17 \n \n\n1.41 \n\n300MPa, 30min 10,37\u00b10.21 28.01\u00b10.48 -2.08\u00b10.22 -4.51\u00b10.31 \n \n\n1.14 \n\n400MPa, 10min 10,78\u00b10.13 27.35\u00b10.45 -2.01\u00b10.39 -4.23\u00b10.55 \n \n\n0.80 \n\n400MPa, 20min 10,81\u00b10.19 27.06\u00b10.74 -1.86\u00b10.48 -4.04\u00b10.66 \n \n\n0.86 \n\n400MPa, 30min 13,65\u00b10.59 24.26\u00b10.26 -1.72\u00b10.43 -2.90\u00b10.61 \n \n\n3.36 \n\n500MPa, 5min 13,02\u00b10.61 23.40\u00b10.25 -0.80\u00b10.44 -1.62\u00b10.60 \n \n\n4.81 \n\n500MPa, 10min 14,68\u00b10.58 22.89\u00b10.18 -1.47\u00b10.47 -2.39\u00b10.73 \n \n\n4.83 \n\n500MPa, 15min 14,48\u00b10.46 23.12\u00b10.73 -1.56\u00b10.66 -2.42\u00b11.05 \n \n\n4.59 \n\n*?E determined for each UHP processed sample in comparison to sample dyed without UHP. \n\nThe improved results on dyeing at long pressurization times and high pressures are in \n\nagreement with the severity of the UHP treatment applied. These UHP conditions provide \n\nthe highest accessibility of fibres, favouring the best conditions for the adsorption of dyes. \n\nNevertheless, results of section 6.3.1., revealed some discrepancy in results. At \n\nconstant fixative load, by varying the dye concentration, the colour intensity of handsheets \n\nshould increase with the increase of dye concentration in solution. However, it was not \n\nalways the case. In these preliminary studies, in order to reveal the UHP effects, a minimal \n\namount of fixative agent was used. However, it seems that the fixative agent plays a rather \n\nrelevant role as intermediate of the dye fixation process and requires specific adjustments \n\nfor each dye. \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 197 ~ \n\n  \n\n Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes \n\nDespite during UHP treatment the accessibility of fibres increase and its zeta \n\npotential decreases, the still high negative charge of fibres requires some additional \n\namounts of fixative agent to improve dyes adsorption. This is confirmed by zeta potential \n\nmeasurements of pulp and of a dye solution (Pergasol Black GN-E) (Table 6. 8). \n\nBearing in mind the aforementioned result, the determination of the fixative optimum \n\nload (OFL), was required. \n\nTable 6. 8 \u2013 Zeta potential measurements of a Pergasol Black GN-E solution and of pulp treated with and without UHP \n\n(EHP and E, respectively). \n\nSample Zeta Potential (mV) pH \n\nE -15.4\u00b13.5 5.9 \n\nE HP -9.9\u00b15.6 5.7 \n\nPergasol Black GNE solution -20.7\u00b11.62 5.7 \n\n6.3.2. Optimization of fixative loads \n\n6.3.2.1. Optimum fixative load (OFL) without UHP treatment \n\nThe importance of fixative agent concentrations on the dyeing process of bleached \n\nkraft hardwood pulp was studied. Hence assays were performed to determine the load of \n\nfixative agent required to ensure optimum dyeing, under conventional impregnation \n\n(without UHP treatment). In these studies, Renova norm PT.LAB.613 was followed, as \n\ndepicted in section 6.2.2. Besides, the determination of the optimum fixative load (OFL) \n\nwas performed with other dyes. The other dyes include Cartasol Blue 3R-EU, Pergasol \n\nViolet BN-TKZ and Pergasol Red 2G-Z. The aim of this study was to relate the fibre \n\ndyeing with the molecular structure of dye molecules and different dyes furnishes (powder \n\nor liquid). \n\nIn those tests six different loads of fixative agent were tested, as displayed in Table 6. \n\n9. In each loading the fixative must be applied in two stages, one at the beginning, before \n\nadding the dye, and then, the other at the end, after the addition and dispersion of the dye. \n\nThe initial step of fixative agent addition is related with the necessity of increasing zeta \n\npotential of cellulosic fibres, to assist their interaction with dyes due to the existing \n\nelectrostatic repulsion between them. Then, dye molecules are added and should interact \n\nmore easily with cellulosic fibres due to the presence of a cationic intermediate (fixative \n\nagent). The final addition of fixative acts as a way to precipitate the remaining dye on \n\nfibres surface. This may occur by the formation of insoluble dye-fixative particles that \n\nprecipitates on the fibres surface. \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 198 ~ \n\n  \n\n Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes \n\nAs concerns the determination of the optimum fixative loads, the procedure was \n\nperformed at fixed dye load (3% (wdye/wpulp)), with different fixative loads (Table 6. 9). \n\nTable 6. 9 \u2013 Different fixative loads for 3% (wdye/wpulp) of dye concentration. \n\nDye % \n\n(wdye/wpulp) \n\nFixative % (wfixative/wpulp) \n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 \n\n3.00 \nStart End Start End Start End Start End Start End Start End \n\n0.000 0.000 0.100 0.650 0.200 1.500 0.300 2.200 0.400 2.600 0.500 3.000 \n\nTo perceive which load of fixing agent would be more advantageous, according to \n\nRenova norms (Renova PT.LAB 613), K/S was used as criteria.

Apparently this favoured the decrease of K/S values in hand sheets. \n\nConsidering the K/S values in Table 6. 10, it was possible to conclude that the OFL \n\n(considering the fixative additions in Table 6. 9) for Pergasol Red 7BE was no. 4, for \n\nPergasol Black GN-E was no. 3, for Pergasol Violet BN-TKZ was no. 2, for Cartasol Blue \n\n3R-EU was no. 4 and for Pergasol Red 2G-Z was no. 2. \n\n6.3.2.2. UHP effect on the impregnation of pulps with different dyes \n\nAfter determining the OFL of each dye, a set of new tests was performed, but now \n\nresorting to UHP treatment. The UHP conditions were selected considering the results \n\nobtained in section 6.3.1.1 and were as follows: 500 MPa pressure and 10 min. \n\nAdditionally, the decrease of fixative agent load by 5, 10 and 15% of fixing agent load, \n\nupon UHP, was also tested. These changes on fixative loads aimed to evaluate when UHP \n\nwould convey similar or better results, while allowing fixative savings. \n\n It is noteworthy that, at this point, a new UHP equipment, with higher capacity (55 \n\nL), was available, which allowed the preparation of all samples in sufficient amount to \n\nproduce standard handsheets. All samples were evaluated considering its K/S (?max) value \n\nand colour space data. These studies were further completed with colour fastness tests, \n\nfollowing the procedure presented in section 6.2.5.2. These tests were performed to \n\nevaluate the colour fastness of each sample, since in case of coloured tissue paper it is \n\nrequired insignificant or zero dye bleeding. For simplicity samples were designated as \n\nfollows: \n\n3% without UHP \u2013 pulp dyed with a dye load of 3% (wdye/wpulp), not subjected to UHP; \n\n3% with UHP \u2013 pulp dyed with a dye load of 3 %(wdye/wpulp), subjected to UHP; \n\n3% with UHP | -5% fixatives \u2013 pulp dyed with a dye load of 3% (wdye/wpulp), subjected to \n\nUHP, whose OFL was reduced by 5%; \n\n3% with UHP | -10% fixatives \u2013 pulp dyed with a dye load of 3% (wdye/wpulp), subjected \n\nto UHP, whose OFL was reduced by 10%; \n\n3% with UHP | -15% fixatives \u2013 pulp dyed with a dye load of 3% (wdye/wpulp), subjected \n\nto UHP, whose OFL was reduced by 15%. \n\ni) Pergasol Red 7BE \n\nThe data for samples dyed with Pergasol Red 7BE is presented in Table 6. 11. The \n\nachieved results allow to confirm the ability of UHP to enhance dye fixation on fibres. By \n\ncomparing samples impregnated in 3% (w/w) dye load, with and without UHP, it was \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 200 ~ \n\n  \n\n Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes \n\npossible to observe a much higher K/S in the case of UHP treated sample. Also, the high \n\n?E (7.05) indicated a substantial colour gain by fibres. These results evidenced the abilities \n\nof UHP to improve the fibres accessibility and the capacity of dyeing. Moreover, even with \n\nremoval of 5, 10 and even 15% fixative, it was still possible to maintain the relatively \n\nhigher dye fixation on fibres, as confirmed by the high K/S values and the colour \n\ndifferences expressed by ?E.  \n\nEach sample bleedfastness was also analysed considering four diffusion media \n\n(water, acetic acid, synthetic saliva and olive oil). The results are represented in Table D.1 \n\nin the Appendices, and did not exhibited variations. This points no effects on the dye \n\nfixation on fibres caused by UHP treatment and the amount of fixative used. \n\nTable 6. 11 - Colorimetric and spectral data collected for samples dyed with Pergasol Red 7BE. \n\nPergasol Red 7BE \n\nSample K/S (?max) L* a* b* Colour ?E* \n\n*3% without UHP 2.12\u00b10.04 57.03\u00b10.22 35.36\u00b10.39 -4.85\u00b10.11 \n \n\n- \n\n3% with UHP 3.20\u00b10.18 52.15\u00b10.51 40.06\u00b10.59 -2.89\u00b10.14 \n \n\n7.05 \n\n3% with UHP \n\n-5% Fixatives 3.03\u00b10.07 52.55\u00b10.29 38.91\u00b10.23 -3.13\u00b10.12 \n \n\n5.97 \n\n-10% Fixatives 3.11\u00b10.06 52.41\u00b10.16 39.94\u00b10.58 -2.7\u00b10.20 \n \n\n6.85 \n\n-15% Fixatives 2.51\u00b10.02 55.21\u00b10.05 38.39\u00b10.49 -4.05\u00b10.23 \n \n\n3.62 \n\n        *?E determined for each UHP processed sample in comparison to sample dyed without UHP. \n\nii) Pergasol Black GN-E \n\nAs concerns Pergasol Black GN-E (Table 6. 12), here the results diverged from those \n\nachieved with Pergasol Red 7BE. After UHP treatment the K/S of samples decreased in \n\nrelation to non-treated samples, yielding a significant colour difference (lighter shade). \n\nMoreover, when removing fixative, the results either maintained or decreased even more. \n\nThese features indicate that the fixative load, determined without UHP, is not enough to \n\nsustain the dye impregnation/fixation with UHP. Possibly, due to the dye molecules nature, \n\na preferential impregnation with fixative is occurring. Thus, remaining fixatives molecules \n\nmay not be enough to intermediate the process of approximation between cellulose and \n\nanionic dye. In this case UHP may have caused disturbances on the equilibrium between \n\ndye-fixative-cellulose and hence changing the required amount of fixative, for dye fixation, \n\nwith UHP. It is noteworthy that dye molecules structures are not known. Additionally, it is \n\nalso unknown whether dyes are made solely by one type of molecule of by a mixture of \n\ndye molecules. \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 201 ~ \n\n  \n\n Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes \n\nTable 6. 12 \u2013 Colorimetric and spectral data collected for samples dyed with Pergasol Black GN-E. \n\nPergasol Black GN-E \n\nSample K/S (?max) L* a* b* Colour ?E* \n\n*3% without UHP 4.1\u00b10.07 39.01\u00b10.3 -0.54\u00b10.08 -2.3\u00b10.03 \n \n\n- \n\n3% with UHP 3.0\u00b10.05 44.32\u00b10.27 -0.94\u00b10.006 -2.91\u00b10.02 \n \n\n5.36 \n\n3% with UHP \n\n-5% Fixatives 3.1\u00b10.02 43.72\u00b10.07 -0.86\u00b10.04 -2.92\u00b10.03 \n \n\n4.76 \n\n-10% Fixatives 3.0\u00b10.03 44.24\u00b10.18 -0.94\u00b10.02 -2.95\u00b10.03 \n \n\n5.29 \n\n-15% Fixatives 2.1\u00b10.07 49.92\u00b10.58 -1.12\u00b10.03 -2.94\u00b10.07 \n \n\n10.94 \n\n       *?E determined for each UHP processed sample in comparison to sample dyed without UHP. \n\nSimilarly to previously tested dye, bleedfastness tests were carried out (Table D. 2 \n\nfrom the Appendices), although no significant changes were registered.

The results on pulp dyeing with this dye are presented in Table \n\n6. 13. \n\nTable 6. 13 - Colorimetric and spectral data collected for samples dyed with Cartasol Blue 3R-EU. \n\nCartasol Blue 3R-EU \n\nSample K/S (?max) L* a* b* Colour ?E* \n\n3% without UHP 1.67\u00b10.02 \n56.08\u00b10.14 9.33\u00b10.04 -23.25\u00b10.11  \n\n- \n\n3% with UHP 1.74\u00b10.05 \n55.41\u00b10.05 9.74\u00b10.07 -23.64\u00b10.04  \n\n0.88 \n\n3% with UHP \n\n-5% Fixatives 1.77\u00b10.009 \n55.15\u00b10.06 9.82\u00b10.09 -23.69\u00b10.07  \n\n1.14 \n\n-10% Fixatives 1.66\u00b10.002 \n55.91\u00b10.02 10.30\u00b10.02 -22.84\u00b10.04  \n\n1.07 \n\n-15% Fixatives 1.84\u00b10.02 \n54.51\u00b10.14 10.79\u00b10.05 -23.70\u00b10.06  \n\n2.19 \n\n*?E determined for each UHP processed sample in comparison to sample dyed without UHP. \n\nThe results obtained with Cartasol Blue 3R-EU revealed, similarly to Pergasol Red \n\n7BE, an improvement of dye adsorption on fibres, upon UHP treatment. This fact was \n\nconfirmed by the increased K/S and the ?E of 0.88. Also, upon diminishing of fixative, K/S \n\ndid vary significantly, being even registered higher values of K/S, with 15% decrease of \n\nfixative agent, than with full charge. In terms of colour difference, the ?E was of 2.19, \n\nwhich is in the range of perceivable colour difference by unexperienced observers. These \n\nresults corroborate the aforementioned hypothesis that UHP should affect the existing \n\nequilibrium between dye, fixative and cellulose, which imply a shift on the OFL. Colour \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 202 ~ \n\n  \n\n Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes \n\nfastness results (Table D.3 on the Appendices) also demonstrated no significant variations \n\nbetween assays. Therefore, it is possible to suggest that dye fixation on fibres was not \n\naffected by UHP treatment and by the amount of fixative used. \n\niv) Pergasol Red 2G-Z \n\nThe results acquired with Pergasol Red 2G-Z samples are depicted in Table 6. 14. In \n\nopposite to previous results, K/S decreased from 2.14 to 1.83, after impregnation with UHP \n\ntreatment, with a perceivable colour difference, when considering ?E (lighter shade). \n\nMoreover, the decrease in K/S became even more significant upon fixative removal. It is \n\npossible that the balance existing between the three intervening parts (dye, fixative and \n\ncellulose) may be shifted due to UHP treatment. Thus, it is possible, once more, that the \n\ndifferent fixative load is required. It is also important to recall that low amounts of fixative \n\ndecrease the dye fixation, and the excess of fixative could originate dye dispersion in \n\nsolution, and hence evading its fixation onto fibres. \n\nTable 6. 14 - Colorimetric and spectral data collected for samples dyed with Pergasol Red 2G-Z samples. \n\nPergasol Red 2G-Z \n\nSample K/S (?max) L* a* b* Colour ?E* \n\n*3% without UHP 2.14\u00b10.03 61.9\u00b10.06 42.01\u00b10.39 16.06\u00b10.28 \n \n\n- \n\n3% with UHP 1.83\u00b10.03 63.43\u00b10.16 40.16\u00b10.39 14.38\u00b10.17 \n \n\n2.93 \n\n3% with UHP \n\n-5% Fixatives 1.72\u00b10.01 63.84\u00b10.09 39.33\u00b10.50 13.89\u00b10.28 \n \n\n3.96 \n\n-10% Fixatives 1.48\u00b10.07 65.20\u00b10.44 37.71\u00b10.50 12.75\u00b10.28 \n \n\n6.35 \n\n-15% Fixatives 1.36\u00b10.009 66.01\u00b10.06 36.86\u00b10.14 11.89\u00b10.13 \n \n\n7.78 \n\n       *?E determined for each UHP processed sample in comparison to sample dyed without UHP. \n\nSimilarly to before, bleedfastness was also accessed for all samples and its results are \n\nrepresented on Table D.4 on the Appendices.

Samples impregnated with 3% (w/w) dye, upon UHP treatment revealed a decrease of \n\nK/S, which according to colour space coordinates registered a minimal colour difference, \n\n?E. Although the reducing of 5% fixative load, upon UHP treatment, yielded an increase \n\nof K/S, the diminishing of K/S was observed when the fixative reduction was 10 or 15%. \n\nThese K/S values were accompanied by ?E. \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 203 ~ \n\n  \n\n Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes \n\nAs concerns bleedfastness, no changes were registered in al assays.

Optimum fixative load (OFL) after UHP treatment \n\nDue to the divergence in previously obtained results, it was necessary to determine \n\nthe optimum fixative load (OFL) after the UHP treatment, similarly as it was done for the \n\ndyeing without UHP treatment (section 6.3.2.1.). The UHP conditions were as follows: \n\npressure - 500MPa, duration \u2013 10min. \n\ni) Pergasol Red 7BE \n\nAlthough previous results demonstrated the improvements of this dye adsorption in \n\nfibres (Table 6. 11), OFL was determined again, now after UHP treatment. The results \n\nobtained are summarised in Table 6.16 and 6.17. In Table 6. 16 it is possible to observe the \n\nK/S and colour space data for each fixative load (no. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, as indicated in \n\nTable 6. 9).

Together with improved dye diffusion into fibres, due to UHP treatment, this last \n\nfactor could have contributed for the efficient fixation of dye molecules on fibres. Such \n\nenhanced dyeing efficiency, with increased OFL, was evidenced both by K/S and ?E \n\nvalues. It is worth to note that an enhanced dyeing efficiency may lead to the diminishing \n\nof organic charge in the mill effluent and hence creating fewer problems in residual waters \n\ntreatment. It is also reasonable to propose that these improvements could lead to deep \n\ncolour shades without resorting to higher dye loading. This was a topic of further studies. \n\nTable 6. 17 \u2013 Comparison between colorimetric and spectral data obtained with and without UHP processing of pulp \n\ndyed with Pergasol Red 7BE. \n\nPergasol Red 7BE?\n\nOFL K/S (?max) L* a* b* Colour ??K/Smax)% ?E \n\nOFL without UHP \n\n4 \n2.12\u00b10.04 57.03\u00b10.22 35.36\u00b10.39 -4.85\u00b10.11 \n\n \n\n+48.6 5.84 \n\nOFL with UHP \n\n6 \n3.15\u00b10.02 53.58\u00b10.07 39.91\u00b10.18 -3.60\u00b10.05 \n\n \n\nThe bleedfastness (Table D.1, Appendices) was also accessed and the results \n\nrevealed no significant variations among samples (bleedfastness degrees between 4 and 5) \n\nof dyed hand sheets, produced from UHP treated and untreated pulps.

The results attained are presented in Table 6. 18. There, it is \n\npossible to observe the colour space and spectral data for each fixative load (no. 1, 2, 3, 4, \n\n5 and 6, as depicted in Table 6. 1) upon UHP (500 MPa, 15 min).

The \n\nOFL with UHP, according to the acquired data, was no. 5, which implies a shift towards \n\nhigher fixative loadings, when compared with the OFL without UHP (load no. 3). \n\nHowever, a higher coloration of pulp was attained with the OFL after UHP, relatively to \n\nOFL without UHP treatment. \n\nBy comparing both OFLs, determined with and without UHP (Table 6. 19), similarly \n\nto Pergasol Red 7BE case, the observed change towards higher fixative loadings suggests \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 205 ~ \n\n  \n\n Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes \n\nshifts on equilibrium between dye-fixative and cellulose, which could be related with an \n\nincreased adsorption of fixative on fibres. Apparently, this increased load was not enough \n\nto cause the dye dispersion in solution, but induced a higher improved dye fixation on \n\nfibres. Hence, OFL after UHP treatment exhibited an increased K/S, with a ?E superior to \n\n5, i.e. a clearly distinguished colour gain. \n\nTable 6. 18 - Colorimetric and spectral data obtained for Pergasol Black GN-E coloured samples, for different fixative \n\nloads for UHP processed pulp. \n\nPergasol Black GN-E \n\nDye load Fixative loads K/S (?max) L* a* b* Colour OFL UHP \n\n3% \n\n(wdye/wpulp) \n\n1 0.46\u00b10.007 75.90\u00b10.15 -4.74\u00b10.02 -4.44\u00b10.05 \n \n\n5 \n\n2 0.99\u00b10.02 63.51\u00b10.28 -3.15\u00b10.03 -4.52\u00b10.05 \n \n\n3 3.95\u00b10.07 39.25\u00b10.33 -0.35\u00b10.03 -2.28\u00b10.09 \n \n\n4 4.50\u00b10.03 37.18\u00b10.12 -0.28\u00b10.02 -1.91\u00b10.006 \n \n\n5 5.20\u00b10.05 34.85\u00b10.18 -0.18\u00b10.05 -1.45\u00b10.05 \n \n\n6 4.92\u00b10.08 35.85\u00b10.29 -0.37\u00b10.03 -1.58\u00b10.10 \n \n\nTable 6. 19 - Comparison between colorimetric and spectral data from Pergasol Black GN-E samples, namely for OFL \n\nwithout UHP and with UHP. \n\nPergasol Black GN-E?\n\nOFL K/S (?max) L* a* b* Colour ??K/Smax)% ?E \n\nOFL without UHP \n\n3 \n4.1\u00b10.07 39.01\u00b10.3 0.54\u00b10.08 2.30\u00b10.025 \n\n \n+26.8 5.64 \n\nOFL with UHP \n\n5 \n5.20\u00b10.05 34.85\u00b10.18 -0.18\u00b10.05 -1.45\u00b10.05 \n\n \n\nThe bleedfastness (Table D.2, Appendices) alike before, was analysed and its results \n\nrevealed no significant changes in terms of bleedfastness degrees (between 4 and 5). The \n\nmost significant variations (which were still small) were found on the samples for the \n\ndetermination of OFL with UHP, possibly due to fixative variation. \n\niii) Cartasol Blue 3R-EU \n\nCartasol Blue 3R-EU was also examined for OFL after UHP treatment. The results \n\nobtained with different fixative loads are displayed in Table 6. 20. In contrast to the two \n\nprevious dyes (Pergasol Black GN-E and Pergasol Red 7BE), it was found a shift towards \n\nlower fixative loading (from no.4 to 2) of OFL after UHP, relatively to OFL without UHP \n\ntreatment. Besides, samples impregnated after UHP still exhibited higher K/S than without \n\nUHP treatments (Table 6. 21). \n\nThe OFL after UHP treatment was determined based on the fixative load rendering \n\nthe highest K/S, which was load no. 2. The decrease found on the required load of fixative, \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 206 ~ \n\n  \n\n Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes \n\nto achieve the optimum dye fixation could be related, not directly to a preferential \n\nadsorption of fixative on fibres, but with a decreased repulsion between this dye molecules \n\nand cellulose. It is known that different dye molecules, although anionic, may interact \n\ndifferently (more or less strongly attracted to cellulose) due to its structural peculiarities. \n\nThe planar geometry of most direct anionic dyes, favours significantly the interactions with \n\ncellulose. Nevertheless, although the dye molecule charge (located in some part of the \n\nmolecule) convey some repulsion towards cellulose, other functional groups or even its \n\ncarbon backbone, may interact with cellulose through other mechanisms. Thus it is \n\npossible that Cartasol Blue 3R-EU, upon UHP, was adsorbed more efficiently on fibres, \n\npossibly, due to its improved affinity towards cellulose (decreased repulsion in relation to \n\nother dyes). Hence, less amount of fixatives was required for the mediation of the dye \n\nfixation. However, since the molecular structure of this dye is unknown this hypothesis \n\nwas not confirmed. \n\nTable 6. 20 - Colorimetric and spectral data acquired for Cartasol Blue 3R-EU coloured samples, for different fixative \n\nloads after UHP treatment. \n\nCartasol Blue 3R-EU \n\nDye load Fixative loads K/S (?max) L* a* b* Colour OFL UHP \n\n3% \n\n(wdye/wpulp) \n\n1 0.21\u00b10.002 81.66\u00b10.13 0.50\u00b10.02 -12.96\u00b1 0.12 \n \n\n2 \n\n2 2.16\u00b10.02 51.39\u00b10.11 11.24\u00b10.06 -21.43\u00b10.08 \n \n\n3 1.40\u00b10.02 57.81\u00b10.15 9.31\u00b10.09 -23.64\u00b10.08 \n \n\n4 1.31\u00b10.01 59.68\u00b10.08 9.56\u00b10.03 -23.30\u00b10.05 \n \n\n5 1.25\u00b10.004 60.38\u00b10.05 9.55\u00b10.04 -23.18\u00b10.05 \n \n\n6 1.15\u00b10.02 61.57\u00b10.20 9.80\u00b10.07 -23.02\u00b10.11 \n \n\nTable 6. 21 - Comparison between colorimetric and spectral data for Cartasol Blue 3R-EU coloured samples, without \n\nUHP and with UHP treatment. \n\nCartasol Blue 3R-EU?\n\nOFL K/S (?max) L* a* b* Colour ??K/Smax)% ?E \n\nOFL without UHP \n\n4 \n1.67\u00b10.02 56.08\u00b10.14 9.33\u00b10.04 -23.25\u00b10.11 \n\n \n\n+29.3 5.38 \n\nOFL with UHP \n\n2 \n2.16\u00b10.02 51.39\u00b10.11 11.24\u00b10.06 -21.43\u00b10.08 \n\n \n\nThe bleedfastness was also accessed and did not show significant variations on the \n\ntested samples (Table D.3, Appendices).  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 207 ~ \n\n  \n\n Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes \n\niv) Pergasol Violet BN-TKZ  \n\nPergasol Violet BN-TKZ was the next examined liquid dye.

Possibly, \n\nboth dye and fixative, are adsorbed on fibres equally and hence no shift on the OFL was \n\nobserved, with and without UHP treatment of pulp. The only difference was apparently the \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 208 ~ \n\n  \n\n Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes \n\nenhanced ability of both compounds to diffuse into the fibres, induced by UHP treatment. \n\nHence, UHP, although in a small and not very significant way, promoted an increase on the \n\ndye fixation on fibres, without compromising the equilibrium between dye-fixative-\n\ncellulose.  \n\nv) Pergasol Red 2G-Z \n\nTo conclude, Pergasol Red 2G-Z coloured samples were analysed at different levels \n\nof fixative loads (Table 6. 24).

Also the colour difference, ?E, \n\nwas superior to 2, i.e. in the range of perceivable colour difference (lighter shade). \n\nTherefore, UHP have affected the dyeing process negatively. \n\nAs discussed before, each dye features interfere with the dyeing process (its \n\nstructure, affinity and substantivity). It is thus possible that this dye may be rather sensible \n\nto fixative concentration in solution and, therefore, shifts on fixative concentration in \n\nsolution, upon UHP, may promote the dye dispersion in solution, instead of dye diffusion \n\nand fixation on the fibre surface.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 209 ~ \n\n  \n\n Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes \n\nTable 6. 25 - Comparison between colorimetric and spectral data for Pergasol Red 2G-Z coloured samples, without UHP \n\nand with UHP treatment. \n\nPergasol Red 2G-Z?\n\nOFL K/S (?max) L* a* b* Colour ??K/Smax)% ?E \n\nOFL without UHP \n\n2 \n2.14\u00b10.03 61.9\u00b10.06 42.01\u00b10.39 16.06\u00b10.28 \n\n \n\n-14.5 2.70 \n\nOFL with UHP \n\n2 \n1.83\u00b10.02 63.35\u00b10.11 40.44\u00b10.09 14.41\u00b10.07 \n\n \n\nFor Pergasol Red 2G-Z, bleedfatsness tests were also performed, and similarly to the \n\nprevious dyes no significant variations were observed (Table D.5, Appendices). \n\n6.3.2.4. Saving of dyes \n\nPergasol Red 7BE was selected as a case study to evaluate if UHP could provide dye \n\nsavings. Hence, tests were performed with Pergasol Red 7BE, resorting to OFL with and \n\nwithout UHP treatment, at 3% (wdye/wpulp) and 4% (wdye/wpulp) dye concentrations. These \n\ntests aimed to evaluate the fixation ability of UHP towards the dye and the potential dye \n\nsavings (which are rather expensive). The results obtained in terms of K/S, and colour \n\nspace data are shown in Table 6. 26. It was found that the colour intensity of 4% (w/w) of \n\ndye concentration, without UHP was similar to that obtained with 3% (wdye/wpulp) of dye \n\nconcentration after UHP treatment. These results revealed that UHP enabled an \n\nimproved/enhanced dye fixation, able to match or approach the colour intensity of a \n\nsample produced with a superior dye load. Even though the shift on fixative agent load \n\nfrom no. 4 (2.5% (w/w) fixative) to no. 6 (3.5% (w/w), due to UHP effect (ca. 40% extra \n\nfixative agent), the results achieved showed ca. 33% of dye savings, which is much more \n\nexpensive than a fixative agent. \n\nThese result evidenced a possibility of dyes savings while subjecting pulp to UHP \n\ntreatment. \n\nTable 6. 26 \u2013 Comparison between samples impregnated with 3 and 4% (w/w) load of Pergasol Ref 7BE, with and \n\nwithout UHP. \n\nPergasol Red 7BE \n\nSample K/S (?max) L* a* b* Colour ?E \n\n4% (wdye/wpulp) without UHP 3.21\u00b10.23 51.74\u00b10.78 39.15\u00b10.72 -2.71\u00b10.29 \n \n\n- \n\n3% (wdye/wpulp) \nwithout UHP 2.12\u00b10.04 57.03\u00b10.22 35.36\u00b10.39 -4.85\u00b10.11 \n\n \n6.85 \n\nwith UHP 3.15\u00b10.02 53.58\u00b10.07 39.91\u00b10.18 -3.60\u00b10.05 \n \n\n2.18 \n\n            *data considering the OFL with and without UHP \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 210 ~ \n\n  \n\n Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes \n\n6.4. Conclusions \n\nThe achieved results allowed to conclude that, overall, UHP enabled an improved \n\nfixation of dyes on fibres. The positive effect of UHP must be related to the improved \n\naccessibility of cellulose in pulp and decreasing of its electrokinetic potential (zeta \n\npotential). At the same time, it was verified that different dyes, displayed different sorption \n\nbehaviours, which were further enhanced upon UHP treatment. It was suggested that these \n\ndifferences could be related to i) chemical structure of dye molecules, ii) dyes affinity and \n\nsubstantivity, iii) variations of cationic fixative concentration, and iv) the influence of UHP \n\non the dye-fixative-cellulose equilibrium. However, it was not possible to prove or confirm \n\nthe phenomena involved due to the lacking of information on each dye structures. Anyway, \n\nthe optimum fixative loads were specific for each dye studied and apparently related to the \n\nbalance between it sorption on the fibres and the interaction with dyes, thus forming \n\ncharged micelles dispersed in the stock. \n\nIt was also confirmed that UHP treatment of pulp allows dyes savings at the same \n\nlevel of colour intensity acquired by fibres. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 211 ~ \n\n  \n\n Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes \n\n6.5.

Introduction \n\nTissue paper is a common good extensively used by modern societies. Tissue \n\nproducts include items such as paper towels, facial tissues or toilet paper, easily found in \n\nany small or big groceries store. Due to its end purposes, it is easy to recognized two main \n\nphysical attributes of these products, softness and their absorbency, with especial emphasis \n\non absorbency. The particular challenge in papermaking has been to appropriately balance \n\nthese various properties to provide superior tissue paper. \n[1\u20134]\n\n \n\nTissue papers and towelling grades that require good absorbency also require suitable \n\nstrength properties to maintain their structural integrity. Although often becomes difficult \n\nto balance both, since both requirements tend to conflict.\n[5]\n\n Although somewhat desirable \n\nfor towel products, softness is particularly important property for facial and toilet tissues. \n\n[3]\n \n\nSoftness is the tactile sensation perceived by the consumer who holds a particular \n\npaper product, rubs it across the skin, and crumbles it within the hand. Such tactile \n\nperceivable softness can be characterized by, but is not limited to, friction flexibility and \n\nsmoothness, as well as subjective descriptor, such as feeling like velvet, silk or flannel. \n\nThis tactile sensation is a combination of several physical properties, including the \n\nflexibility or stiffness of the sheet of paper, the frictional properties of the web, as well as \n\nthe texture of the surface of the paper.\n[1,3,4,6]\n\n \n\nAbsorbency is the measure of the ability of a certain material to absorb liquids. \n\nOverall absorbency as perceived by consumers is generally considered to be a combination \n\nof the total quantity of liquid a given mass of tissue will absorb at saturation as well as the \n\nrate at which the mass absorbs the liquid. Absorption can be directly related to the softness \n\nand bulk, although not always in the same way. Due to paper's affinity for water, paper is \n\nan absorbent product, the fibres form hydrogen bonds with water. But paper with many \n\nlinks between fibres has more resistance to water absorption. This is because there are \n\nmore links between fibres, which makes it less porous, preventing the diffusion of water \n\ninside. Besides, water penetration must break some links between fibres, delaying the \n\npenetration itself. \n[1,3,7]\n\n \n\nThe creping in tissue paper is a key operation to improve absorption. During the \n\ndrying operation the sheet adheres to a large dryer called Yankee. When the paper reaches \n\nthe end of the course, once it has been dried, strikes against a blade which causes the paper \n\nto crinkle, developing microwrinkles. In this operation many bonds between fibres that had \n\nbeen formed during the drying stage, are broken generating a lot of fines, which are \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 218 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter VII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Humectants \n\ncapable of absorbing water. It also increases expressively the surface area of the sheet, \n\nfacilitating the interaction with water. Finally, the creping increases the bulk and makes the \n\npaper soft. Therefore, the creping operation is an essential procedure for tissue paper \n\nproduction.\n[4,6,8\u201310]\n\n \n\nIn hygiene and cosmetic products, chemical additives, otherwise denominated as \n\nwetting agents, humectants or moisturizers may be added to further improve both \n\nabsorptive properties along with softness properties. \n[11]\n\n In products such as tissue paper or \n\nnon-woven fabrics its composition includes at least one kind of materials selected from \n\nsalts having high hygroscopy, or polymer having high hygroscopy. Such chemical \n\nmaterials are preferably chosen from food additives (e.g. polyphosphates), or cosmetic \n\ningredients (e.g. glycerine, pyrrodilone, polyethylene glycol, etc.).\n[11\u201314]\n\n These chemicals \n\nact by attracting and holding on to water. Thus these compounds are applied, in a wide \n\nvariety of products, either to retard water loss or to increase its uptake. A good example \n\nwould be their use to improve moisture content on tissue paper, by capturing and retaining \n\nmoisture in air, and enhance softness and its feel to skin. \n[11]\n\n \n\nUltra-high pressure (UHP) is a technology that has demonstrated its benefits towards \n\nreversing hornification (responsible for fibres stiffening and losses on hydration), due to \n\nthe structural changes it produces. Besides the rearrangements of crystalline regions, it \n\ninduces forced hydration on amorphous regions provoking water molecules to be \n\nimprisonment in less accessible sites as strongly bound water. This also provokes fibril \n\ndisaggregation and improved accessibility.\n[15]\n\n This enables higher accessibility towards \n\nchemicals and enzymes, as demonstrated in the literature.\n[15\u201317]\n\n With this in mind, the work \n\naimed to use UHP to promote the impregnation of humectants on fibres to improve its \n\nhydrophilic features and thus enhance fibres absorbency. It is also expected that by \n\nimproving moisture capture, the addition of this additives may confer a certain freshness \n\nand softness to the touch of pulp, although this features will not be considered on this \n\nstudy. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 219 ~ \n\n  \n\n Chapter VII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Humectants \n\n7.2. Materials and Methods \n\nSimilarly to previous studies on the impregnation of additives, for the reasons \n\nalready described, the raw material used in these studies was virgin hardwood pulp. \n\nTherefore, Eucalyptus globulus bleached kraft industrial pulp, E, kindly supplied by \n\nRenova FPA, S.A. was used as reference raw material for the impregnation studies. Also \n\nthe humectants employed were the following: \n\n? Polyethylene glycol, Mw 200, PEG 200, (99.5%, Acros Organics) \n\n? Polyethylene glycol Mw 400, PEG 400 (99%, Acros Organics) \n\n? Polyethylene glycol Mw 600, PEG 600 (99.5%, Acros Organics) \n\n? Sodium polyphosphate, PP (pure, Acros Organics) \n\n \n\n7.2.1. Impregnation of pulp with saturated humectant solutions \n\nThe impregnation of PEG 200 on E pulp was performed as follows: 10 g of pulp \n\nwere dispersed in water and then PEG 200 was added reaching a total volume of 440 mL \n\ncontaining 20% (w/v) PEG concentration. These doped pulp samples were prepared by two \n\ndifferent ways. One was by subjecting samples to UHP treatment (500 MPa for 10 min, \n\noptimum conditions, previously used on dyes impregnation tests), while the other was by \n\nsubjecting samples to stirring, only, for the same time.  \n\nSamples treated by UHP treatment were placed, beforehand, on HDPE flasks, \n\nvacuum sealed, and then subjected to UHP. The UHP treatments were performed on a high \n\npressure apparatus, model 55 Hyperbaric, with water as pressure transmission medium. \n\nSamples treated and untreated by UHP were then filtered with glass porous filters \n\n(previously weighted), allowed to dry and then placed in a desiccator over P2O5 to achieve \n\nnearly zero moisture content. Afterwards samples were weighted and the shifts on samples \n\nweights were analysed. The same procedure was used for the impregnation of pulp with \n\nPEG 400 and PEG 600. Being the only difference the PEG 600 concentration, which was \n\n10% (w/v). It is noteworthy that the use of a PEG 600 solution with 10% (w/v) of \n\nconcentration, instead of a solution with a concentration of 20% (w/v) (for comparative \n\nreasons), was due to difficulties on the solubilisation of PEG 600 in water and its relatively \n\nhigh viscosity. \n\nAdditionally, the same procedure was applied on the impregnation of pulp with PP, \n\nbeing the only difference the impregnation solution concentration, which was 5% (w/v). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 220 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter VII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Humectants \n\n7.2.2. Impregnation of pulp with selected humectants \n\nThe same impregnation procedure was carried out, as in section 7.2.1., for the \n\nfollowing sets of pulp samples, impregnated with 5% (w/v) PEG400, 1% (w/v) PEG400, \n\n5% (w/v) PP, 1% (w/v) PP and mixture of 0.5% (w/v) PEG with 0.5% (w/v) PP. \n\n7.2.3. Leaching tests \n\nThe leaching of additives from impregnated pulp samples was accessed according \n\nto the procedure described below. 1 g of each sample prepared as described in section \n\n7.2.1, was weighted (in duplicate) and placed in 100mL of distilled water under stirring at \n\nroom temperature. Aliquots were collected from time to time and analysed for released \n\nadditives. PEG samples were analysed by high performance liquid chromatography, \n\nHPLC, and PP samples by orthophosphate content in solution.  \n\n7.2.3.1. Quantification by High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) \n\n? Acetonitrile (Acros Organics, 99.9% HPLC grade) \n\n? Ultrapure water \n\nThe quantification of PEG polymers was performed on an Acella apparatus from \n\nThermo Scientific, equipped with an autosampler, a reflective index detector (RI) and a \n\ndiode array detector (PDA). All analyses were carried out with a HypersilGold column, \n\nfrom Thermo Scientific, with dimensions 50x2.1mm, particle size of 1.9 ?m and pore size \n\nof 175 \u00c5. \n\nIn case of PEG 200, analyses were performed using isocratic conditions (4% \n\nacetonitrile: 96% water), with a 350 ?L/min flow rate, and an injection volume of 10 mL. \n\nData was analysed considering PDA results at 190 nm. Calibration was performed \n\nconsidering solution of 0.1, 0.4, 0.8 and 1% (w/v), and is represented in Appendices E. \n\nAs concerns PEG 400 and PEG 600, its quantification was performed also under \n\nisocratic condition (20% acetonitrile, 80% water), with a flowrate of 300 ?L/min, and an \n\ninjection volume of 10 mL. Data was analysed considering PDA results at 194 nm. The \n\ncalibration curves for PEG 400 and PEG 600 quantification was performed considering \n\nstandard solutions of 0.25, 0.5, 0.6, 0.75, 1.2 %(w/v) and 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1% (w/v), \n\nrespectively. These calibration curves are also presented in Appendices E. \n\n7.2.3.2. Colorimetric quantification of orthophosphates \n\n? H2SO4 (Acros Organics, 96%) \n\n? Antimony potassium tartrate (99%, Acros Organics) \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 221 ~ \n\n  \n\n Chapter VII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Humectants \n\n? Ammonium molybdate (99.9%, Acros Organics) \n\n? Ascorbic acid (99%, Acros Organics, ) \n\n? Ammonium Persulphate (99%, Alpha aesar) \n\n? KH2PO4 (99%, WRV) \n\n? NaOH (85%, VWR) \n\nThe amount of released PP was followed considering the amount of total \n\northophosphates in solution, in agreement with norm EPA 3652. The process is based on \n\nammonium molybdate and antimony potassium tartrate reaction in acid medium with \n\ndilute solution of phosphorous to form antimony-phospho-molybdate complexes. These \n\ncomplexes are reduced to intensely blue coloured complexes by ascorbic acid, being the \n\ncolour proportional to the phosphorus concentration. \n\nBefore quantification, according to the norm, a combined reagent required for the \n\ntests was prepared. This reactant enables the quantification of orthophosphates. With this \n\npurpose the following solutions were prepared, H2SO4 5 N, antimony potassium tartrate \n\nsolution (1.3715 g K(SbO)C4H4O\u00b71/2H2O in 500 mL), ammonium molybdate solution (20 \n\ng of (NH4)6 Mo7O24\u00b74H2O in 500 mL distilled water) and ascorbic acid 1 M. For the \n\ncombined reagent preparation, 50 mL of H2SO4 5 N were placed on a beaker under \n\nconstant stirring. Then, by order, the following solutions were added, 5 mL of antimony \n\npotassium tartrate solution, 15mL of ammonium molybdate solution and 30 mL of ascorbic \n\nacid solution. The combined reagent was then stored to use on the next steps. \n\nThe quantification of the total of orthophosphates from each sample was \n\ndetermined in agreement with procedure described below. Initially, 50 mL of sample (1 \n\nmL aliquots were diluted up to 50 mL) was placed on 100-150 mL beakers, along with 1 \n\nmL of H2SO4 5.5 M and 0.4 g of ammonium persulphate. The mixture was allowed to boil \n\nuntil volume was reduced to approximately 10 mL. After cooling down, samples were \n\ndiluted up to 25-30 mL and its pH was tuned to 7.0 ? 0.2 with NaOH solutions (10, 1, 0.1, \n\n0.01 and 0.001 M) using a pH Meter, model HI2020 - edge\u00ae multiparameter, from Hanna \n\nInstruments. Then, samples were transferred into a 50 mL volumetric flask, to which 8 mL \n\nof combined reagent were also added. The flasks were then filled with distilled water up to \n\n50 mL. After 10 min waiting, samples absorbance was measured on UV-vis \n\nspectrophotometer Evolution 220 (Thermo Scientific) at 880 nm. \n\nFor the preparation of the blank sample, used as reference, the procedure was the \n\nsame, being the only difference the substitution of sample for distilled water. \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 222 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter VII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Humectants \n\n Calibration was performed by analysing standard solutions of KH2PO4 between 0.3 \n\nmg/L and 1 mg/L. The calibration curve is represented in Appendice E. \n\n7.2.4. Moisture uptake \n\nAll samples were investigated for its ability to uptake moisture at room conditions. \n\nFor that 1g of each sample (absolutely dry) was placed on previously weighted petri plates \n\n(in duplicate).

Results and Discussion \n\nThe main purposes on this chapter was to test different humectants that would \n\nconvey cellulose its hygroscopic abilities, to enhance pulp hydrophilicity and thus improve \n\npulp sorption abilities. It may be proposed that while gaining an improved ability to \n\ncapture moisture, the softness of pulp would be also improved. \n\n7.3.1. Tests on different humectants \n\nPreliminary impregnation tests were performed with different humectants to access \n\npulp properties influenced by the presence of these reactants, and to check the UHP \n\ntreatment effect on these properties. Thus, the following additives were tested: sodium \n\npolyphosphate (PP) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) with different molecular weights, Mw \n\n200(PEG 200), Mw 400 (PEG 400) and Mw 600 (PEG 600). The same bleached E. globulus \n\npulp (E) as used in previous chapters, was employed on these studies. Pulp E was \n\nimpregnated with 20% (w/v) solutions (PEG 200 or 400), 10% (w/v) of PEG 600, or 5% \n\n(w/v) of PP. A part of this samples were subjected to UHP treatment, while the other was \n\nsubjected to stirring only. For simplicity, samples were designated as shown in Table 7. 1. \n\nTable 7. 1 \u2013 Designations of pulp samples impregnated by PEG and sodium polyphosphate. \n\nSample Description \n\nE Industrial Bleached kraft E. globulus pulp \n\nPEG200 E impregnated with a 20% (w/v) PEG 200 solution without UHP treatment, just stirring. \n\nPEG200 HP E impregnated with a 20% (w/v) PEG 200 solution by UHP treatment. \n\nPEG400 E impregnated with a 20% (w/v) PEG 400 solution without UHP treatment, just stirring. \n\nPEG400 HP E impregnated with a 20% (w/v) PEG 400 solution with UHP treatment. \n\nPEG600 E impregnated with a 10% (w/v) PEG 600 solution without UHP treatment, just stirring. \n\nPEG600 HP E impregnated with a 10% (w/v) PEG 600 solution with UHP treatment. \n\nPP E impregnated with a 5% (w/v) PP solution without UHP treatment, just stirring. \n\nPP HP E impregnated with a 5% (w/v) PP solution with UHP treatment. \n\n7.3.1.1. Additives retention on fibres \n\nThe fixation of additives onto fibres was investigated by monitoring changes of \n\nsamples weights (before and after impregnation, of dried samples) and also by analyses of \n\nfiltrates. The results obtained are presented in Table 7. 2 for samples impregnated with \n\nPEGs and in Table 7. 3 for samples impregnated with PP. \n\nBased on weight increment of samples impregnated with saturated PEG solutions, \n\nbefore and after the UHP treatment, it was possible to infer that UHP prompted an \n\nenhanced impregnation of additives to fibres, rendering their increased retention on fibres \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 224 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter VII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Humectants \n\n(Table 7. 2). As discussed in previous chapters, UHP enables an improvement of fibres \n\naccessibility towards chemicals. Hence, similar behaviour was detected in the study with \n\nsome PEGs solutions. The monitoring of filtrates was also performed for control. \n\nHowever, these results are not portrayed here, due to divergences found in results, most \n\nlikely related with high relative errors obtained in dilutions required to enable filtrates \n\nanalysis. \n\nTable 7. 2 \u2013 Increments of weight of pulps impregnated with PEG solutions, with and without UHP treatment. \n\nSamples PEG200 PEG200 HP PEG400 PEG400 HP PEG600 PEG600 HP \n\nwdry pulp(g) 9.1861 9.1852 9.1753 9.2113 9.2014 9.1712 \n\nwdry impregnated pulp(g) 15.2428 15.3047 13.4593 16.6139 12.3711 13.472 \n\n?

(g) corresponds to the amount of additive retained \n\nAnalysing the experimental data, overall, it was possible to observe, that PEG 400 \n\nsolution allowed the best retention/fixation, especially upon UHP treatment. The uptakes \n\nof PEG 200 and PEG 600 were inferior to that of PEG 400, although the concentration of \n\nPEG 600 (10% (w/v)) used was inferior to those for PEG 200 and PEG 400 (20% (w/v)). \n\nHowever, it seems clear that PEG sorption on fibres depended on their molecular weights. \n\nThis must be related to the PEG capacity to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and Van-\n\nder-Waals bonds with cellulose and with its diffusion inside fibres. UHP enabled an \n\nimproved diffusion of PEG molecules due to the improved accessibility of fibres, thus \n\nenhancing the additives adsorption. Besides the specific interaction of PEG with cellulosic \n\nfibres the diffusion inside fibre cell structure also can be the limiting factor. Hence the best \n\nresults obtained with PEG 400 may be the result of successful combination of both factor. \n\nSamples impregnated with PP were also monitored, and the obtained results are \n\npresented in Table 7. 3. In this case the opposite results, relatively to PEG samples, were \n\nachieved. Instead of an enhanced sorption of PP, upon UHP treatment, a decrease of \n\nadsorbed PP was registered. However, PP sample exhibited higher rigidity when compared \n\nto PP HP. Possible explanations may be related to the fact that i) UHP assisted \n\nimpregnation allowed a more uniform distribution of PP and therefore the relatively small \n\ncrystals only are precipitated on fibres, more homogenously distributed and possibly \n\nstrongly hydrated, ii) PP without UHP treatment may have produced heterogeneous \n\nnucleation of PP on fibres surface, prompting the formation of larger crystals, \n\nheterogeneously distributed, thus conferring more conspicuous rigidity to the sample. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 225 ~ \n\n  \n\n Chapter VII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Humectants \n\nTable 7. 3\u2013 Increments of weight of pulps impregnated with PP, with and without UHP treatment. \n\nSamples PP  PP HP \n\nwdry pulp(g) 9.2296 9.1842 \n\nwdry impregnated pulp(g) 16.1015 14.9257 \n\n?

Leaching tests \n\ni) PEG samples \n\nAfter analysing additives fixation on fibres, upon UHP treatment, its retention upon \n\nleaching was also studied. Samples were subjected to 3 h leaching in distilled water, under \n\nstirring and at room temperature. Aliquots were collected from time to time and analysed \n\nby HPLC for PEG samples and UV-Vis, for orthophosphate content, as regards PP \n\nsamples. \n\nResults for the different PEG impregnation samples are given in Figure 7. 1. Overall, \n\nresults revealed a higher release of additives for UHP treated samples, than for those \n\nwithout UHP treatment. As expected UHP treated samples released more additives during \n\nleaching relatively to non-treated samples. This result confirms the presence of higher \n\namounts of PEG in pulp, after UHP treatment, than after conventional impregnation. \n\nAs concerns PEG 200 impregnated pulp samples, the quantification of PEG 200 \n\nrelease, from both non-treated and UHP treated samples, was performed considering the \n\nsum of all molecular fractions (7 fractions), presented in PEG 200 (broad Mw distribution) \n\n(Figure 7. 2). The contribution to the leaching of each fraction was also analysed at the end \n\nof the 3h leaching period, to perceive which molecular weights were more prone to be \n\nleached, or were retained on fibres (Figure 7. 3). Each number of fraction (F1-F7) roughly \n\ncorresponds to the oligomers (from monomer to heptamers). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 226 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter VII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Humectants \n\n  \na) b) \n\n \nc) \n\nFigure 7. 1 \u2013 Leaching of PEG samples, impregnated with and without UHP treatment. a) PEG200 HP and PEG200; b) \n\nPEG400 HP and PEG400; c) PEG 600 and PEG600 HP, respectively. \n\n \n\nFigure 7. 2 \u2013 HPLC chromatogram of PEG200 sample (detection at 190nm), where F1 correspond to the 1st fraction of \n\nPEG200 exiting the column, followed by F2 the 2\nnd\n\n fraction, F3 the 3rd fraction, F4 the 4th fraction, F5 the 5th fraction, \n\nF6 the 6th fraction and F7 the 7th fraction. \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 227 ~ \n\n  \n\n Chapter VII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Humectants \n\n \n\nFigure 7. 3 \u2013 Leaching of PEG 200 fractions from samples PEG 200 and PEG200 HP, after 3 h leaching period. For \n\ncomparison, it is also presented the distribution of fractions in a PEG 200 standard solution with 1% (w/v) concentration. \n\nThe terminology used in Figure 7.2 to designate fractions was the same, although, in this case F1+2 represents fraction 1 \n\nand 2. \n\nThe results in Figure 7. 3 showed clearly the discrimination effect of different PEG \n\noligomers retention on cellulosic fibres. Relatively small PEG molecules (monomers-\n\ndimers) were much easily to release during leaching than the bigger oligomers. PEG \n\nmolecules from fractions F5-F7 were preferentially retained on fibres during leaching. It \n\ncan be also concluded that PEG molecules from fractions F5-F7 were easily leached from \n\nthe pulp samples impregnated with PEG 200, under UHP conditions. This fact may be \n\ntentatively explained by the better accessibility of PEG 200 HP sample, than of PEG 200 \n\npulp sample, due to the less hornification during drying. Anyway, the results obtained \n\nshowed that fibres interaction increases with increased molecular weight of PEG, at least \n\nup to heptamers. \n\nThis case scenario discrimination effect was only possible to analyse for PEG200 \n\nonly, because it was the only PEG exhibiting a well-defined molecule weight distribution \n\nof oligomers. However, the same study was not possible to carry out for samples \n\nimpregnated by PEG 400 and PEG 600, because of limited resolution of either HPLC or \n\nSEC (size exclusion chromatography) columns to separate individual oligomers. \n\nii) PP samples \n\nThe leaching of PP from samples impregnated with and without UHP, was monitored \n\nby analysing content of orthophosphates in solution (Figure 7. 4). The results revealed \n\nlower PP release from PP HP sample, relatively to PP pulp sample. Such result was \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 228 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter VII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Humectants \n\nexpected and is in agreement with a lower amount of PP attached to fibres, upon UHP \n\ntreatment, as was observed from mass balance results (Table 7. 3). \n\n \n\nFigure 7. 4 \u2013PP release profiles from PP impregnated pulp samples, with and without UHP treatment (PP HP and \n\nPP respectively). \n\n7.3.1.3. Moisture sorption \n\nThe capacity of impregnated samples to uptake moisture was also investigated, under \n\nroom conditions (20\u00b11\u00baC and ca. 50% RH). The results obtained are shown in Figure 7. 5. \n\nThe results revealed higher moisture uptake for all samples, comparatively to control pulp \n\n(E), except for sample PEG 600 HP. This last exhibited a Xeq lower than that of untreated \n\npulp (E), conversely to PEG 600 sample, whose Xeq was higher than E. The remaining \n\nsamples, all demonstrated higher Xeq, which was further boosted upon UHP, up to the \n\ndouble of untreated pulp.  \n\nAlthough samples impregnated with PEG200 exhibited rather promising results, \n\nresults with PEG 400, after UHP treatment were even more impressive.  \n\n \n\nFigure 7. 5 \u2013Moisture uptake, Xeq % (wmoiture/wdry pulp), (20\u00b11\u00baC, ca 50%RH), for PEG and PP series of samples, \n\nimpregnated with and without UHP treatment. \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 229 ~ \n\n  \n\n Chapter VII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Humectants \n\nMoisture uptake results could also be considered as a way to measure the efficiency \n\nof additive impregnation. The purpose of humectants on fibres is to provide additional sites \n\nfor moisture uptake and, therefore, to increase pulp affinity towards water. In the case of \n\nthe three PEGs, the difference in Mw, between one another, may play an important role, not \n\nonly on the impregnation efficiency (larger or smaller molecules are impregnated/retained \n\nless or more efficiently), but also from the point of view of moisture uptake (larger \n\nmolecules interacting with cellulose could hinder their moisture uptake by free OH \n\ngroups). \n\nIt is important to select a humectant that allows a good fixation, together with a high \n\ncapacity to uptake and retain moisture to produce smooth and moistened paper. Since, PEG \n\n400 Xeq was almost as elevated as PEG200, together with a good fixation capacity (similar \n\nto PEG 600), PEG 400 was selected for further studies.  \n\nAs concerns samples impregnated with PP, higher Xeq was found for UHP treated \n\nsamples than for untreated ones. Which is inconsistent with the higher amount of additive \n\non fibres. Probably, the fact that PP samples, without UHP, were very rigid, with non-\n\nuniform PP distribution on the fibre surface, may explain a difficulty to uptake water. PP \n\nwas possibly more uniformly distributed and hydrated, on the fibrils surface of pulp, due to \n\nUHP treatment, which promoted increased accessible area and high Xeq. Nevertheless, for \n\ntesting other properties, such as physical and mechanical properties, a smaller additive load \n\nwas considered to avoid abrupt PP precipitation on pulp.  \n\n7.3.2. Papermaking properties of pulp impregnated with PEG and PP \n\nAfter preliminary tests for the pulps impregnation with different PEG and PP, the \n\nmost advantageous additives, namely PEG 400 and PP, were selected for further evaluation \n\nof their effect on papermaking properties of modified pulps. The concentration of \n\nhumectants in assays were diminished in order to approximate the industrial conditions and \n\ndue to cost/efficiency reasons. Additionally, it was pertinent to test also the impregnation \n\nof mixed additives, namely PEG 400 with PP, to look for possible synergetic effects. The \n\npurpose of this study was to understand how these additives affect not only the interaction \n\nwith water (moisture uptake, capillary rise, water absorption capacity), but also basic paper \n\nproperties (\u00baSR, bulk, tensile strength, burst index, stretch%, tear index, air resistance and \n\nopacity). Initially the assays were carried out to access and evaluate the materials \n\ncapability to sorption and then the papermaking properties were accessed. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 230 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter VII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Humectants \n\nThe designations attributed to each samples are given in Table 7. 4. \n\nTable 7. 4 \u2013 Samples designations. \nSample Description \n\nE Industrial bleached kraft E. globulus pulp \n\nE HP E treated by UHP treatment \n\n5% PEG400 E impregnated with a 5% (w/v) PEG400 solution \n\n5% PEG400 HP E impregnated with a 5% (w/v) PEG400 solution under UHP treatment \n\n1% PEG400 E impregnated with a 1% (w/v) PEG400 solution \n\n1% PEG400 HP E impregnated with a 1% (w/v) PEG400 solution under UHP treatment \n\n5% PP E impregnated with a 5% (w/v) PP solution \n\n5% PP HP E impregnated with a 5% (w/v) PP solution under UHP treatment \n\n1% PP E impregnated with a 1% (w/v) PP solution \n\n1% PP HP E impregnated with a 1% (w/v) PP solution under UHP treatment \n\nMixture E impregnated with a mixture of 0.5% (w/v)+0.5% (w/v) of PEG400 and PP \n\nMixture HP E impregnated with a mixture of 0.5% (w/v)+0.5% (w/v) of PEG400 and PP, \n\nunder UHP treatment \n\n7.3.2.1. Water sorption \n\nThe water sorption was evaluated for all samples, by moisture sorption tests (20\u00b11\u00baC \n\nand ca. 49% RH), capillary rise tests and water absorption capacity tests (basket immersion \n\ntest). \n\nThe moisture uptake of all samples impregnated with humectants (Figure 7. 6), with \n\nand without UHP treatment, exhibited a significant increase of Xeq, relatively to the control \n\npulp (E). The highest water sorption was registered for samples treaded with 5% (/w/v) PP, \n\nespecially under UHP conditions. Samples impregnated with 5% PP revealed the highest \n\nwater sorption, even higher than with samples impregnated with 5% (w/v) PEG400, whose \n\nlevels of water uptake were similar to those obtained with samples impregnated with 1% \n\nPP (w/v). Samples impregnated with 1% (w/v) PP were those with the highest water \n\nsorption, when compared to PEG samples. Among samples treated with and without UHP, \n\nit was possible to observe that only samples 5% PEG400 HP and Mixture HP revealed a \n\nlower Xeq, in relation with untreated samples (5% PEG 400 and Mixture, respectively). \n\nThis divergence could be explained by the experimental error. \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 231 ~ \n\n  \n\n Chapter VII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Humectants \n\n \n\nFigure 7. 6 \u2013 Moisture uptake, (20\u00b11\u00baC; 50% RH), for samples impregnated with PEG 400, PP, and their mixture (0.5% \n\nPEG+0.5% PP), with and without UHP treatment. \n\n \n\nFigure 7. 7 \u2013 Capillary rise results of pulp samples impregnated with PEG 400, PP and their mixture (0.5% PEG+0.5% \n\nPP), with and without UHP treatment. \n\n \n\nFigure 7. 8 - Water absorption capacity of samples impregnated with PEG 400, PP and their mixture (0.5% PEG+0.5% \n\nPP), with and without UHP treatment. \n\n8,00\n\n11,00\n\n14,00\n\n17,00\n\nC\na\np\nil\na\nry\n\n r\nis\n\ne\n (\n\nm\nm\n\n/m\nin\n\n) \n\n+7.0% +3.7% \n0.0% \n\n+1.2% \n\n+12.2% +12.8% \n+8.7% \n\n+4.5% \n0.0% \n\n+8.7% \n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nX\ne\nq\n%\n\n(w\nH\n\n2\nO\n/w\n\np\nu\nlp\n) \n\n+36.5 % \n\n+41.3% \n\n+22.2% \n+23.9% \n\n+20.6% \n+14.3% \n\n+17.4% \n\n+23.8% +27.0% \n\n+19.0% \n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nW\na\nte\n\nr \nA\n\nb\ns\no\nrp\n\nti\no\nn\n c\n\na\np\na\nc\nit\ny\n \n\n(g\nH\n\n2\nO\n/g\n\ns\no\nli\nd\n) +22.4% \n\n+31.7% \n\n+23.9% +25.2% \n\n+4.9 % \n\n+12.14% \n\n+4.9 % \n+6.8% \n\n+19.5% \n+21.4 % \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 232 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter VII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Humectants \n\n The moisture uptake assays were further complemented with Klemm capillary tests, \n\nand water absorption capacity tests, typically used in Renova mill to scrutinize the pulps \n\nhydration skills. It was found that not always samples impregnated upon UHP resulted on \n\nincreased capillarity, and that results were somehow divergent between one another. \n\nOverall, the impregnation with humectants showed similar or some increased capillarity of \n\npulp (Figure 7. 7). This was expectable due to the addition of hydrophilic additives to \n\nfibres. However, in case of UHP treated samples, results diverged between one another. In \n\nsome cases, UHP slightly improved capillarity (1% PP HP, 5% PEG HP and Mixture HP), \n\nwhile in other cases this one was reduce (5% PP HP and 1% PEG HP). A possible \n\nexplanation is related to the eventual balance between improved hydrophilicity of fibres \n\nand the final macroporosity, affected by pulp modification. \n\n The water absorption capacity (Figure 7. 8) is a standard procedure in Renova mill to \n\nacess papers hydration skills. The results achieved revealed that all UHP treated samples \n\nexhibited higher water absorption capacity, than untreated ones. This was not always in \n\nagreement with moisture sorption tests (Figure 7. 6). Though the divergences were \n\nminimal. It is noteworthy that 1% PP sample (with and without UHP treatment) \n\ndemonstrated the same level of sorption as 5% PP (without UHP), and these results are not \n\nfar from samples treated with a mixture of both PEG and PP. \n\n The evaluation of samples hydration skills, demonstrated that the use of humectants \n\nto improve fibres hygroscopicity gave positive results, with special emphasis for samples \n\nimpregnated with 5% PP, followed by 1% PP and mixture of PEG with PP. Practically in \n\nall assays the hydration properties inserted by humectants were enhanced by UHP \n\ntreatment, though not always very significantly. \n\n7.3.2.2.

In the case of pulp samples \n\nimpregnated with the highest load of PEG, this loss on strength properties was the highest, \n\nrelatively to samples impregnated with lower PEG loads. However, this deterioration of \n\nstrength properties was always diminished, while UHP processing of pulp was applied in \n\nthe impregnation assays with humectants. \n\nSamples impregnated with 5% (w/v) PEG contained a higher amount of PEG400, \n\ncomparatively with samples treated with 1% (w/v) PEG. In this case PEG should play a \n\nrole of debonding agent, which contributes for an easier disruption of fibres network \n\n(losses on strength properties).\n[7,18\u201320]\n\n Although UHP treatment benefits the improvement \n\nof paper strength, the losses in mechanical properties were still significant when compared \n\nto initial pulp (E). \n\nDecreasing PEG load, although it resulted in small losses on water uptake abilities, it \n\nallowed to reduce the impact of PEG on fibres strength properties. Nevertheless, fibres \n\nimpregnated with UHP treatment were able, not only to reduce remarkably the interference \n\nbrought by PEG on fibres strength properties, but also, in some cases, to improve in small \n\npercentages those properties. It is possible that the decrease of PEG load, together with \n\nUHP treatment effects may have contributed to keep or even improve, somehow, fibre \n\ninterbonding. This fact is endorsed by air resistance results. An increased PEG load, even \n\nupon UHP, rendered lower air resistance, which suggests higher porosity, whereas in case \n\nof samples treated with low amount of PEG (1% (w/v)), fibres become more strongly \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 234 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter VII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Humectants \n\nlinked and organized, as demonstrated by the increase on handsheets air resistance. \n\nBesides, adding PEG to fibres rendered and increased higher bulk.  \n\nEven though the undesirable effect brought by PEG it was possible to improve fibres \n\nwater uptake, without harm significantly strength properties. Using a moderate PEG \n\nconcentration (1% (w/v)) it was possible to reach fairly good water absorptivity (Figure 7. \n\n6 \u2013 7.8), without serious deterioration of mechanical strength (Table 7. 5). \n\nii) Pulps doped with PP \n\nSamples impregnated with PP were also investigated according to its basic paper \n\nproperties, which are presented in Table 7. 6.  \n\nTable 7. 6 - Physical and mechanical properties of pulp impregnated with and without PP, with and without UHP. \n\n \nE EHP ? %\n\n*\n 5%PP ? %\n\n*\n 5%PP HP ? %\n\n*\n 1%PP ? %\n\n*\n 1%PP HP ? %\n\n*\n \n\n\u00baSR \n\n\u00b10.9  \n17 16 -5.9 15 -11.8 16 -5.9 16 -5.9 17 0 \n\nBulk, cm\n3\n/g \n\n\u00b1 0.10 \n2,030 2,077 +4.7 2,122 +4.5 2,102 +3.5 2,056 +1.3 2,040 +0.5 \n\nBurst index, KPa.m\n2\n/g \n\n\u00b10.08  \n1,03 1,10 +6.8 0,67 -35.0 0,70 -32.0 1,28 +24.3 1,39 +35.0 \n\nTensile strength, N.m/g \n\n\u00b11.17  \n23,5 22,5 -4.3 17,5 -25.5 17,5 -25.5 25,3 +7.7 28,1 +19.6 \n\nStretch, % \n\n\u00b10.06  \n1,19 0,93 -21.8 0,89 -25.2 0,84 -29.4 1,19 0 1,48 +24.4 \n\nTear index, mN.m\n2\n/g \n\n\u00b1 0.18 \n3,58 4,38 +22.3 3,08 -16.2 2,93 -18.2 4,68 +30.7 4,88 +36.3 \n\nOpacity, % \n\n\u00b11.1  \n84,26 84,28 +0.02 84,48 +0.26 84,73 +0.6 84,00 -0.3 83,93 -0.39 \n\nAir resistance, s/100mL \n\n\u00b10.05  \n1,19 1,03 -13.4 0,78 -34.5 0,87 -26.9 1,28 +7.6 1,33 +11.8 \n\n* The increment of strength properties after impregnation, with or without, UHP pre-treatment were calculated with \n\nrespect to pulp E (? %).  \n\nIt was found that PP impregnation, with 5% (w/v) concentration resulted on the \n\nsignificant decrease of handsheets strength properties, whereas with lower PP loadings (1% \n\n(w/v)) positive effects would be achieved upon PP impregnation. This last, would also be \n\nenhanced upon UHP treatment. The effect of UHP was insignificant when fibres were \n\nimpregnated with 5% (w/v) PP solutions. The decrease on strength properties may be \n\nrelated with interference of PP precipitated particles on fibres surface, in considerable \n\namount to hinder inter-fibres interaction, as the case of fillers in papermaking.\n[21]\n\n \n\nIn the case of samples impregnated with 1% (w/v) PP concentration, the opposite \n\neffect was registered, with and without UHP treatment. Strength properties such as tensile \n\nstrength, burst and tear index, demonstrated significant improvements, which were even \n\nhigher upon UHP treatment. It is possible that with small concentrations of PP, this \n\ncompound conforms to fibre and hinder interfibre bonding.  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 235 ~ \n\n  \n\n Chapter VII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Humectants \n\nAir resistance results for samples impregnated with 1% (w/v) concentration of PP \n\nrendered higher air resistance values, which are in agreement with a less porous and more \n\norganized/tightly packed fibres structure. On the other hand, high PP concentration \n\noriginated the opposite results, which were explained by disordering PP effect of fibre \n\nbonding. The addition of salt like additive did not affect greatly pulp drainability, although \n\nin same cases a small decrease was found. As concerns the pulp\u2019s bulk, as expected, the \n\naddition of inorganic additives induced an increase of bulk. \n\nThe pulp impregnation with 1%PP (w/v) solution, under UHP, promoted not only \n\nfibres hydrophilicity, but also basic papermaking properties. Nevertheless, in terms of \n\npaper softness, it is noteworthy that PEG treated samples were softer to touch, than PP \n\ntreated samples. Moreover, these last revealed to be problematic upon handsheets \n\nproduction due to its stickiness towards the handsheets dryer. Considering the benefits and \n\nthe disadvantages of both PEG and PP additives, it was thought that the mixture of both \n\ncould results on good hydration properties, together with less problems related to strength \n\nproperties. \n\niii) Pulps doped with mixture of humectants \n\nThe effect on fibres impregnation with a PEG and PP mixture was also studied and \n\nthe results achieved are presented in Table 7. 7.  \n\nTable 7. 7 - Physical and mechanical properties of pulp impregnated with and without impregnation with mixture of 0.5% \n\n(w/v) of PEG and 0.5%PP (w/v), with and without UHP treatment. \n\n \nE EHP ? %\n\n*\n Mixture ? %\n\n*\n Mixture HP ? %\n\n*\n \n\n\u00baSR \n\n\u00b10.9  \n17 16 -5.9 17 0 18 +5.9 \n\nBulk, cm\n3\n/g \n\n\u00b1 0.10 \n2,030 2,077 +4.7 2,073 +2.1 2,046 +0.8 \n\nBurst index, KPa.m\n2\n/g \n\n\u00b10.08  \n1,03 1,10 +6.8 1,14 +10.7 1,37 +33.0 \n\nTensile strength, N.m/g \n\n\u00b11.17  \n23,5 22,5 -4.3 24,3 +3.4 20,8 -11.5 \n\nStretch, % \n\n\u00b10.06  \n1,19 0,93 -21.8 1,19 0 1,02 -14.3 \n\nTear index, mN.m\n2\n/g \n\n\u00b1 0.18 \n3,58 4,38 +22.3 4,72 +31.8 4,83 +34.9 \n\nOpacity, % \n\n\u00b11.1  \n84,26 84,28 +0.02 83,82 -0.5 83,86 -0.5 \n\nAir resistance, s/100mL \n\n\u00b10.05  \n1,19 1,03 -13.4 1,25 +5.0 1,27 +6.7 \n\n* The increment of strength properties after impregnation, with or without, UHP pre-treatment were calculated with \n\nrespect to pulp E (? %).  \n\nThe results revealed a small variation on strength properties, being the most \n\nconspicuous the shifts on tensile strength and stretch (%). It is possible that the use of both \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 236 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter VII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Humectants \n\nadditives in small dosage attenuated the negative effects previously seen, in higher \n\nloadings, individually, due to less interference with interfibre bonding. \n\nIt is noteworthy the increases found not only due the combination of PEG and PP, \n\nbut also upon UHP treatments. These last were especially noticeable on burst and tear \n\nindex, suggesting that fibres network were fortified by both additives, especially after UHP \n\ntreatment (fibril disaggregation, increased accessibility and uniform dispersion of \n\nadditives). The results on air resistance supported the aforementioned statements, as the \n\nincreases were found in treatment assays, with and without UHP, unveiling a less porous \n\nand more efficiently packed fibres. In terms of opacity no significant changes were \n\nregistered, which is indicative of a low interference of additives on papers opacity. \n\nFrom the results achieved for all formulations, the samples that exhibited the best \n\nperformance in terms of hydration skills and strength properties, were samples \n\nimpregnated with 1%PP (w/v), followed by samples impregnated by the mixture of PEG \n\nand PP. Although the first yielded better results, its hand sheets exhibited higher roughness \n\nto touch, relatively to samples impregnated with mixture of humectants, which in terms of \n\ntissue paper production constitutes a rather relevant issue. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 237 ~ \n\n  \n\n Chapter VII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Humectants \n\n7.4. Conclusions \n\nThe positive effect of UHP on the impregnation of humectants in fibres was \n\ndemonstrated. Overall, it was possible to observe higher sorption of these additives into \n\nfibres, upon UHP treatment. Besides, it was demonstrated that during UHP treatment of \n\nwater soluble polymeric humectants (PEG), a discrimination effect on the sorption of \n\noligomers of different molecular weight was observed. This fact affected strongly the \n\nretention of PEG on fibres. \n\nIncreased hydration skills were achieved for samples impregnated with humectants, \n\nwhich were further enhanced by UHP treatment. The use of humectants, such as PEG 400 \n\nand PP demonstrated the possibility of improving the hydration properties of fibres with \n\nincreased moisture capture abilities and absorptivity by soaking in water. Additionally, it \n\nwas found that even though these additives improved the hydration abilities of pulp, they \n\nalso affect negatively strength properties, which required an optimization of the \n\nhumectants formulation applied. These negative effects were assigned to interferences \n\nbrought by additive on interactions between fibres that weakens their interfibre bonds. \n\nFinally, by varying the additive loads it was possible to attenuate the \n\nabovementioned negative effects, on pulp strength properties, or even improving them. \n\nThese variations were possibly related with a more controlled dispersion of additives, \n\nenough to avoid their interference with fibre bonding, while, at the same time, keeping \n\nhigh hydration properties. \n\nIt was also concluded that the formulation that enabled the best hydration/strength \n\npulp properties was 1%PP (w/v), followed by mixture of both PP (0.5% (w/v)) and PEG \n\n(0.5% (w/v)), both subjected to UHP treatment. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 238 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter VII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Humectants \n\n7.5.

Introduction \n\nOn nowadays modern society, antimicrobial finishing of materials has been gaining \n\ngrowing relevance. \n[1,2]\n\n Redefining tissue products to enhance hygiene is a way to \n\nminimize and contain the spreading of harmful microorganisms. An example of this would \n\nbe Cascades\u00ae Antibacterial Towels. \n[3,4]\n\n In the case of natural fibres, such as cellulose, \n\nthey exhibit a tendency to microorganism\u2019s growth, such as bacteria and fungi. These \n\nmicroorganisms are easily found almost everywhere and are able to multiply quickly when \n\ntheir basic needs are met, such as moisture, nutrients and temperature.\n[1,5]\n\n  \n\nThe use of antimicrobial agents provides protection against pathogens and other \n\nmicroorganisms, which could origin either medical or hygienic problems. These \n\nantimicrobial agents differ in terms of chemical structure, effectiveness, method of \n\napplication, its impact on humans and on the environment, as well as in its cost.\n[1,2]\n\n \n\nTo achieve the desired effect, an ideal antimicrobial agent should gather a few \n\nrequirements, such as be effective against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, while \n\ndisplaying low toxicity to consumers. It should also be durable (be active for a long period \n\nof time) and compatible with the chemical and technological processes, in which it will be \n\nincluded. It also should be cost effective and not harmful to either the manufacturer or the \n\nenvironment. \n[5,6]\n\n \n\nAn example of an effective antimicrobial agent is polyhexamethylene biguanide \n\n(PHMB), which is a cationic polymer with cationic biguanide repeating units separated by \n\nhydrocarbon chain blocks of identical or dissimilar length. PHMB is a strong and broad \n\nspectrum antimicrobial agent with low toxicity, features that have attracted the attention \n\nfor antimicrobial finishing in textile industry. This compound is frequently used as a \n\ndisinfectant in the food industry and in the sanitization of swimming pools. It was also \n\nexplored as a biocide in mouthwashes and wound dressings. \n[1,5,7,8]\n\n \n\nIn order to embody antimicrobial properties to cellulosic materials, these may be \n\nfunctionalized with antimicrobial materials either in bulk or by addition of encapsulated \n\nantimicrobial agents. This last strategy may result in improvements on the controlled \n\ndelivery of these compounds and improve their activity. This method also aims to reduce \n\nthe amount of antimicrobial agent applied (more efficient utilization) and to decrease \n\nnegative effect of the final product, such as undesired variations of products properties \n\n(due to the interactions of the antimicrobial with the product matrix) or secondary effects \n\nto consumers (e.g. skin irritation), etc.\n[9\u201312]\n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 244 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter VIII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Antimicrobial agents \n\nUltra-Hydrostatic high pressure, UHP emerges here, similarly to previous studies, as \n\na prominent technique enhancing cellulosic fibres accessibility and thus facilitating \n\nchemicals implementation in fibres.\n[13\u201315]\n\n Accordingly, the main purpose of this work \n\nconsisted in the impregnation of fibres with antimicrobial agent PHMB, with and without \n\nUHP treatment. The effects on UHP treatment on pulp impregnation with PHMB solution \n\nwas evaluated in terms of antimicrobial properties of processed pulp and PHMB leaching \n\nin aqueous solutions. Additionally, the impregnation of cellulosic fibres, with and without \n\nUHP, with encapsulated PHMB was also investigated. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 245 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter VIII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Antimicrobial agents \n\n8.2 Materials and Methods \n\nSimilar to previous studies on the impregnation of additives, the raw material used \n\nwas virgin hardwood pulp. As depicted before, this raw material was used as reference to \n\navoid irregularities coming from the variability of recycled pulps lots. Thus, conventional \n\nindustrial bleached E. globulus kraft pulp and an antimicrobial agent, (poly(hexamethylene \n\nbiguanide) hydrochloride), PHMB (20% (w/w) solution, Arch UK Biocides), were kindly \n\nsupplied by Renova FPA, SA. and used in the impregnation tests. \n\n8.2.1 Impregnation of PHMB on cellulosic fibres \n\n? P2O5, (98%, Acros Organics) \n\nDifferent sets of samples, with and without UHP treatment, were impregnated with \n\nPHMB. The samples designations are presented in Table 8. 1. \n\nTable 8. 1 \u2013 Samples designations. \n\nSamples Description \n\n0.5%  Fibres impregnated with a 0.5% (w/v) solution of PHMB;  \n\n0.5% HP Fibres impregnated with a 0.5% (w/v) solution of PHMB under UHP (500MPa, 10min); \n\n0.1% Fibres impregnated with a 0.1% (w/v) solution of PHMB; \n\n0.1% HP Fibres impregnated with a 0.1% (w/v) solution of PHMB under UHP (500MPa, 10min); \n\n0.01% Fibres impregnated with a 0.01% (w/v) solution of PHMB; \n\n0.01% HP Fibres impregnated with a 0.01% (w/v) solution of PHMB under UHP (500MPa, \n\n10min); \n\n0.001% Fibres impregnated with a 0.001% (w/v) solution of PHMB; \n\n0.001% HP Fibres impregnated with a 0.001% (w/v) solution of PHMB under UHP (500MPa, \n\n10min); \n\nE Standard pulp \n\nE HP Standard pulp subjected to UHP (500MPa, 10min) \n\nFor samples preparation, pulp was dispersed in PHMB solutions with different \n\nPHMB concentrations (0.5, 0.1, 0.01% and 0.001% (w/v)), resulting of 2% consistency \n\npulp suspensions. For each PHMB load, two samples were prepared, one was subjected to \n\nUHP treatment (500 MPa, 10 min), while the other was subjected to agitation, under \n\natmospheric pressure (reference). The UHP conditions were the same as suggested \n\npreviously for the impregnation of other additives (500 MPa, 10 min). In the case of \n\nsamples treated with UHP (0.5% HP, 0.1% HP, 0.01% HP and 0.001%HP), the pulp \n\nsuspensions, with corresponding amount of PHMB, were placed into HDPE containers, \n\nsealed and then submitted to UHP (500 MPa, 10 min) on a Hyperbaric model 55 \n\nequipment. On the other hand, samples impregnated without UHP (0.5%, 0.1%, 0.01% and \n\n0.001%), were left stirring for 10 min (the same time spent in the UHP treatment). \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 246 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter VIII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Antimicrobial agents \n\nAfter the impregnation with PHMB solution, a part of the samples was filtered, air \n\ndried and then kept on a desiccator over P2O5 (0% relative humidity), while the other was \n\nemployed in the preparation of standard handsheets. For comparative reasons, pulp \n\nsamples without PHMB were also considered. Thus, pulp without any kind of treatment \n\n(without PHMB addition and without UHP treatment), was designated Control, and the \n\npulp without addition of PHMB and subjected to UHP (2%, consistency, 500 MPa, 10 \n\nmin), was designated as Control HP. \n\n \n\n8.2.2 PHMB silica capsules. \n\n? Ammonia solution (25 \u201328%, Sigma-Aldrich) \n\n? Span\u00ae 85 (Sigma-Aldrich) \n\n? Tween\u00ae 20 (Sigma-Aldrich),  \n\n? Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich)  \n\n? Cyclohexane 99.9% (Merck).  \n\nSilica capsules with PHMB were prepared according with a previously developed \n\nmethod \n[16]\n\n, through reverse emulsion, using Span\n\u00ae\n85 and Tween\n\n\u00ae\n20 as surfactants, \n\ncyclohexane as co-solvent and an ammonia solution as catalyst. An oil phase was prepared \n\nby dissolving 1 g of Span\u00ae85 in 50 mL of cyclohexane. Afterwards, one drop of \n\nTween\n\u00ae\n20 in 5 mL of PHMB solution, followed by the addition of 2.0 mL of ammonia \n\nsolution (25\u201328%) (water phase), were added to the oil phase under stirring and a water-in-\n\noil micro-emulsion was achieved. After a few minutes stirring, 2.0 mL of TEOS was added \n\nto the w/o micro-emulsion under vigorous stirring and kept in a closed vessel for 24 h. The \n\nprecipitate was then filtered, washed with cyclohexane and dried at 60\no\nC.  \n\nTo test capsules stability towards UHP treatment a diluted solutions of capsules (1 \n\nmL) was subjected to UHP (500 MPa, 10 min, on a hyperbaric model 55, Burgos, Spain, \n\napparatus). The samples were analysed before and after the treatment by SEM analysis. \n\n8.2.2.1 Impregnation with PHMB capsules \n\nPulp suspensions were impregnated with PHMB silica capsules. 2.5 g of pulp were \n\ndispersed in distilled water (2% consistency). After thoroughly dispersed, PHMB silica \n\ncapsules were added making up a concentration of 0.1% (w/v) of capsules in solution. \n\nTwo sets of samples were prepared, one destined for UHP treatment and another for \n\nimpregnation solely by stirring. The first one was placed on a HDPE container, sealed and \n\nthen subjected to UHP treatment (on a Hyperbaric model 55 equipment) during 10 min at \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 247 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter VIII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Antimicrobial agents \n\n500 MPa, while the other was left stirring during the same time. Afterwards both samples \n\nwere filtered, air dried and stored on a desiccator under P2O5. \n\n8.2.3 Leaching tests \n\nLeaching tests were performed (in duplicate) to investigate the release behaviour of \n\nPHMB from cellulosic fibres. 1 g of sample was weighted and placed into a beaker, \n\nalready filled with 100 mL of distilled water, under stirring. Aliquots of solution were \n\ncollected from time to time and analysed by UV-Vis spectroscopy.  \n\n8.2.3.1 PHMB quantification \n\nThe PHMB released during the leaching tests was monitored by UV-Vis \n\nspectroscopy, on an UV-vis spectrophotometer Evolution 220 (Thermo Scientific). \n\nStandard PHMB aqueous solutions were prepared (1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20 mg/L), and its \n\nabsorbance at 234 nm was measured, and used to derive a calibration curve correlating \n\nabsorbance with PHMB concentration. The calibration curve is represented on Appendice \n\nF. \n\n8.2.4 Handsheets preparation \n\nStandard handsheets were prepared following ISO 5269-2:2004, on a Rapid-K\u00f6then \n\nsheet former (Karl Schr\u00f6der KG) \n\n8.2.5 Physical and mechanical properties \n\nFibres drainability was evaluated by analysing the Schopper-Riegler degree \n\naccording to ISO 5267-1:1999. Thickness, density and specific volume of prepared \n\nhandsheets were evaluated according to ISO 534:2011. Tensile strength, stretch, tear index, \n\nburst index and air resistance (Gurley method), were evaluated following ISO 1924-\n\n2:2008, ISO 1974:2012, ISO 2758:2014, and ISO 5636-5:2013 norms, respectively. \n\nOpacity of handsheets were determined following ISO 2471:2008 using Elrepho tester \n\n(Lorentzen &amp; Wettre). \n\n8.2.6 Solid UV-vis reflectance  \n\nUV-vis diffuse reflectance (UV-vis DR, k/s) spectra were recorded on a UV-vis \n\nspectrophotometer Evolution 220 (Thermo Scientific) equipped by an ISA-220 reflectance \n\naccessory using BaSO4 as background reference at scan velocity of 200 nm/min. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 248 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter VIII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Antimicrobial agents \n\n8.2.7 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) \n\nSEM (scanning electron microscopy) analysis of capsules was also performed in \n\nscanning electron microscope Hitachi S4100 at an accelerating voltage of 25 kV on carbon \n\nsputtered samples. For this analysis a diluted dispersion of capsules was prepared and \n\ndeposited on a silica lamella, previously attached to a SEM support with carbon tape. Then \n\nsamples were carbon sputtered, previously to SEM analysis. \n\nIn the case of handsheets of pulp impregnated with capsules, those were analysed in \n\nthe same equipment at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. In this case small pieces of sample \n\nwere attached to a SEM support by carbon tape and then subjected to Au/Pd sputtering \n\nbefore SEM analysis. \n\n8.2.8 Fourier transform infrared - FTIR \n\nFourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the paper samples were collected using \n\na spectrometer Bruker optics tensor 27 coupled to a horizontal attenuated total reflectance \n\n(ATR) cell, using 256 scans at a resolution of 4 cm\n-1\n\n. The spectres were normalized \n\naccording with 2900cm\n-1\n\n band (C\u2013H stretching vibration). \n\n8.2.9 Antimicrobial analysis \n\n?

The quantitative analyses were performed based on the \n\nmethodology present in the NP EN ISO 20743:2007 norm, being used the transfer method. \n\nIt consists on an evaluation method in which the test bacteria are placed on an agar plate \n\nand transferred onto paper samples of 38 mm diameter. The target microorganisms used in \n\nthese trials were: Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Listeria innocua (ATCC 33090). \n\nFor each sample analysis with possible antimicrobial activity was carried another one, to \n\nthe respective control sample (without UHP treatment and/or without PHMB). All samples \n\nwere analysed in triplicate. In order to transfer the microorganisms to the target paper \n\nsamples, 1.0 mL of a suspension at 1x10\n6\n \u2013 3x10\n\n6\n CFU/ml was spread on the surface of a \n\nTSA plate (the excess was removed), and then samples were set forth the inoculum over 1 \n\nmin. After that period, one sample (in triplicate) was microbiologically evaluated (0 hours \n\nof incubation) while another one, in triplicate, was closed in petri plates (without any agar) \n\nand remained 24 h at 37 \u00baC being analysed.  \n\nThe microbiological analyses of the sample consisted in the paper sample washing \n\ninside a stomacher bag with a neutralizing solution over 2 minutes using a Stomacher 80 \n\n(Seward), and a consequently series decimal dilution of the resulting washing residue (with \n\n0.1% Peptone Salt Solution) was performed, being plated 1.0 mL on PCA for E. coli and L. \n\ninnocua. Afterwards, the plates were incubated at 37 \u00b1 1 \u00baC for L. innocua and E. coli, 36 - \n\n48 hours and 24 h respectively. \n\nIn all cases, Petri dishes containing 30\u2013300 colony forming units (CFU) were \n\nselected for counting and the value of Log CFU for each paper sample was calculated with \n\nEquation 8.1, where CB is the microbial load concentration per mL (CFU/mL), Z is the \n\nmean value of CFU/mL in the triplicated microbiological analysis and R is the dilution \n\nfactor used for the bacterial enumeration; and Equation 8.2 where M is the bacterial \n\nnumber per test piece and V the volume of the neutralizing solution added in the washing \n\nprocess. \n\n?? = ? \u00d7 ?

The samples designations were the same as presented in \n\nTable 8. 1. \n\nThe abovementioned samples were analysed by UV-Vis diffusive reflectance and \n\ntheir spectres are represented in Figure 8. 1. Looking into both sets of spectra it was \n\npossible to observe that samples subjected to UHP exhibited higher intensity at 234 nm \n\n(characteristic band of PHMB\n[17]\n\n) comparatively to untreated samples. Interestingly, in \n\ncase of samples impregnated with 0.1% (w/v) solution this difference became even more \n\nnoticeable, than after impregnation with 0.5% (w/v) solution. These results evidenced that \n\nsamples, impregnated with UHP treatment exhibited a higher amount of PHMB, than pulp \n\nsamples impregnated with PHMB solution without UHP. This fact was attributed to \n\nimproved accessibility of fibres, upon UHP treatment that favoured PHMB adsorption on \n\nfibres. This improvement was particularly notable at low concentrations of PHMB in \n\nsolution, when static sorption on fibre surface was not so significant. \n\n \n \n\n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 8. 1 \u2013UV-vis diffusive reflectance spectra of samples impregnated with 0.1 and 0.5% (w/v) PHMB solution with \n\n(0.1% HP and 0.5% HP) and without UHP (0.1% and 0.5%). \n\n8.3.1.1 PHMB release studies \n\nPHMB release in aqueous medium was also studied and the results achieved for the \n\naforementioned samples are represented in Figure 8. 2. \n\n0 \n\n4 \n\n8 \n\n12 \n\n16 \n\n200 220 240 260 280 \n\nk\n/s\n\n \n\nWavelength (nm) \n\n0.1%\n\n0.1% HP\n\n0 \n\n4 \n\n8 \n\n12 \n\n16 \n\n200 220 240 260 280 \n\nk\n/s\n\n \n\nWavelength (nm) \n\n0.5%\n\n0.5% HP\n\n\n\n \n\n~ 251 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter VIII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Antimicrobial agents \n\n  \n\n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 8. 2 \u2013 PHMB release profiles, in water, from samples impregnated with 0.1 (a) and 0.5%(w/v) PHMB solution \n\n(b), with (0.1% HP and 0.5% HP) and without UHP (0.1% and 0.5%). \n\nThe release profiles of PHMB revealed a decreasing of it removal, from samples \n\nsubjected to UHP treatment, when compared to untreated samples. Additionally, this \n\ndifference was even more evident for samples treated with a higher PHMB concentration \n\n(0.5% (w/v) PHMB solution).  \n\nThese results diverge from the results achieved in the previous chapter (Chapter 7), \n\nwhere UHP induced higher uptake of humectants, accompanied by an accelerated additive \n\nrelease in water. It is proposed that positively charged PHMB interacts strongly with \n\nnegatively charged cellulosic fibres. Additionally, due to improved fibres accessibility, \n\nupon UHP treatment, PHMB penetrates deep inside fibres structure favouring the \n\nformation of strong interactions with cellulose. These facts may contribute to the improved \n\nretention of PHMB. However, with increasing PHMB concentration in solution, the \n\ninteractions by hydrogen bonds, between PHMB molecules, start playing an important \n\nrole, leading to multilayer sorption on cellulosic fibres surface.\n[5,7,18]\n\n Therefore it is \n\nplausible that, for high PHMB loading, PHMB attached to fibres surface is bound to fibres \n\nby weak forces, and therefore its leaching becomes more easy in aqueous medium, when \n\ncompared to fibres treated with low PHMB loads (predominance of ionic interactions). \n\n8.3.1.2 Physico-mechanical properties \n\nConsidering the samples investigated so far, a set of samples was selected for further \n\nscrutiny, namely the ones treated with the low PHMB load (0.1% and 0.1% HP). Thus, \n\nhandsheets of these were prepared and analysed for its physical and mechanical properties. \n\nThe main purpose was to perceive how PHMB would interfere on the fibres properties and, \n\nat the same time, evaluate the effect of UHP treatment on the same properties. With this in \n\nmind the following samples were analysed: pulp without UHP treatment (E); pulp solely \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 252 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter VIII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Antimicrobial agents \n\ntreated by UHP treatment (EHP); pulp impregnated with PHMB without UHP treatment \n\n(0.1%); and pulp impregnated with PHMB and UHP treatment (0.1% HP). The results are \n\npresented in Table 8. 2. The data collected from both sets of samples, impregnated with \n\nPHMB, revealed significant losses in paper strength (tensile strength, burst and tear index) \n\naccompanied by slight gains on bulk and opacity. The losses in strength properties were \n\nmore accentuated on samples impregnated with UHP treatment, than without UHP \n\napplication. \n\nIt is known, from the literature, that PHMB (cationic polymer) interacts strongly with \n\ncellulose (negatively charged polymer) through ionic interactions and hydrogen bonds.\n[7]\n\n It \n\nis possible that by bounding with cellulose, PHMB interferes in fibres interactions \n\n(bonding), weakening the fibres network and therefore affecting paper\u2019s strength \n\nproperties. This behaviour has been observed in paper for other additives of similar nature, \n\nsuch as debonding agents. These additives include cationic polymers (e.g. quaternary \n\nammonium compounds) used to decrease fibre interbonding, and thus increase paper \n\nsoftness.\n[19\u201322]\n\n From this point of view it may be suggested that PHMB hinders interfibre \n\nbonding, conveying poor paper strength properties. Since UHP treatment promote PHMB \n\nsorption on fibres, the strength properties are particularly affected. \n\nThe decrease on air resistance of samples containing PHMB implies a material with \n\nhigher porosity (more void space between fibres) and, therefore, less bonding area. \n\nAdditionally, the small decrease found on \u00baSR further supports the reduction of interactions \n\nbetween fibres and, therefore, an easier water draining. Variation in bulk was expectable \n\ndue to the diminished fibres bonding capacity. \n\nTable 8. 2 \u2013 Properties of samples impregnated with PHMB (0.1% and 0.1% HP) and pulp without PHMB, with and \n\nwithout UHP (Control and Control HP). \n\nSamples E E HP ?

The pulp samples impregnated with \n\ndiluted PHMB solutions (0.01% and 0.001% (w/v) PHMB solutions), revealed, in general, \n\nattenuated negative effects on their strength properties. This, however, was not the case of \n\ntear resistance, which increased. Since less molecules of PHMB are attached to fibres, less \n\ninterference may be expected on the interfibre bonding. Thus, it is possible that the \n\ndisruption of fibres network did not occur as easily as before, with relatively high \n\nconcentration of PHMB in solution. This was mirrored by the small losses in strength \n\nproperties of pulps with adsorbed PHMB (Table 8. 3). Moreover, it was also possible to \n\nobserve an increase of tear resistance of pulps containing PHMB, especially for UHP \n\nprocessed pulp samples.  \n\nIt was also not possible to conclude the role of UHP with different PHMB \n\nconcentrations due to divergence in results between samples treated with 0.01% and \n\n0.001% (w/v) PHMB solutions. With 0.01% (w/v) PHMB in solution, the negative effect \n\nimparted by antimicrobial agent was further attenuated, upon UHP treatment, whereas with \n\n0.001% (w/v) PHMB solution the opposite trend was observed. This could be the result of \n\na balance between the improved impregnation of PHMB by UHP and UHP effect on fibres \n\n(forced hydration, fibrils disaggregation, increased accessibility, etc.). Even though the \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 254 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter VIII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Antimicrobial agents \n\ndecrease on PHMB load attenuated the negative impact on strength properties, it may \n\naffect papers antimicrobial features. Hence, it was necessary to evaluate and confirm \n\nsamples antimicrobial activity. \n\n8.3.1.3 Antimicrobial activity \n\nThe antimicrobial ability of samples treated with different loadings of PHMB, was \n\nevaluated. The effect of the UHP treatment (500 MPa, 10 min) was also considered. \n\nSamples E (control) and EHP (control HP) were used as the control samples, thus taking \n\ninto consideration not only the pulp itself, but also the effect of UHP on pulp. The tests \n\nwere performed both on gram-positive and gram positive bacteria. \n\nThe method followed to analyse the antimicrobial activity of the above samples was \n\nbased on the NP EN ISO 20743 norm, considering the following microorganisms: \n\n? Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 \n\n? Listeria innocua ATCC 33090 \n\nThis method is based on the transfer of microorganisms into the samples, through \n\ncontact between the inoculum and the sample. This method is widely used to evaluate the \n\nantimicrobial activity in textile products, fibres, yarn, among others.  \n\nThe first tests were carried out with E. coli, and the results obtained are displayed in \n\nFigure 8. 3. \n\n \n\nFigure 8. 3 \u2013 Results from the evaluation on the antimicrobial activity on samples subjected to the microorganism E. coli. \n\nAs expected it was noticeable that control samples did not hold any antimicrobial \n\nactivity, as confirmed by the increase of Log CFU/specimen from 4.27\u00b10.17 to 8.48\u00b10.01, \n\nafter a 24-hour incubation period. A similar behaviour was also observed for control HP \n\nsample in the same range of values. \n\n \n \n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nE\n(Control)\n\nE HP\n(Control HP)\n\n0.1% 0.1% HP 0.01% 0.01% HP 0.001% 0.001% HP\n\nL\no\ng\n C\n\nF\nU\n\n/s\np\ne\nc\nim\n\ne\nn\n\n \n\n0 hours 24 hours\n\n\n\n \n\n~ 255 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter VIII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Antimicrobial agents \n\nSamples treated with high PHMB concentrations (0.1% e 0.01% (w/v)), with and \n\nwithout UHP treatment, clearly exhibited antimicrobial activity. This was quite evident by \n\nthe values ?1.00 Log CFU/specimen, already on zero time. Moreover, the same samples \n\ndid not exhibited growth during incubation. As regards the samples treated with the lowest \n\nPHMB concentration (0.001% (w/v)), the observed behaviour was different. A notable \n\nmicrobial growth was observed during the incubation period from 3.57\u00b10.04 to 7.15\u00b10.18 \n\nLog CFU/ specimen and from 3.69\u00b10.18 to 7.47\u00b10.29 Log CFU/ specimen, for the samples \n\nimpregnated without UHP treatment, and for the sample subjected to UHP treatment in \n\nPHMB solution, respectively. \n\nThe same analysis was performed with microorganism Listeria innocua and the \n\nresults obtained are presented in Figure 8. 4. \n\n \nFigure 8. 4 - Results from the evaluation on the antimicrobial activity on samples subjected to the microorganism L. \n\ninnocua. \n\nThe results with L. innocua were quite similar to those obtained with E.coli. control \n\nand control HP samples displayed an increase from 5.63\u00b10.03 to 9.81\u00b10.01 Log \n\nCFU/specimen, and from 5.59\u00b10.35 to 9.75\u00b10.26 Log CFU/specimen, respectively. It was \n\ndemonstrated that samples treated with more concentrated PHMB solutions (0.1% and \n\n0.01% (w/v), with and without UHP), on time zero, already exhibited values of ?1.00 Log \n\nCFU/specimen. Microorganisms growth during the incubation period was not observed. \n\nOnly for samples treated with lower PHMB concentrations (0.001% (w/v)), the \n\nmicroorganism\u2019s growth was observed during the incubation time from 5.51\u00b10.11 to \n\n9.75\u00b10.02 Log CFU/specimen on the sample without UHP treatment, and from 5.39\u00b10.48 \n\nto 9.82\u00b10.10 Log CFU/specimen, for UHP treated samples. \n\nThe differences observed between PHMB concentrations, as regards the \n\nantimicrobial activity on paper samples, is mainly related with the higher amount of \n\nPHMB required to avoid the growth of microorganisms.

Therefore, for future applications, as regards \n\nboth gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, pulp treatment with both 0.1% and 0.01% \n\n(w/v) of PHMB solution may be sufficient for paper to display clear antibacterial \n\nproperties. Nevertheless, it seems that the PHMB concentration of 0.01% (w/v) is \n\npreferable because of the minimal effect on the physical properties of pulp (Table 8. 3). \n\n8.3.2 Impregnation with silica capsules \n\nThe functionalization of cellulosic fibres was also performed with PHMB \n\nencapsulated in silica capsules. The main purpose of this tests were to testing the capsules \n\nability to be attached to fibres along with its antimicrobial activity potential, with and \n\nwithout UHP treatment. The capsules used in these tests were prepared and characterized \n\nby collaborators and had the same features of those in the literature.\n[16]\n\n PHMB capsules \n\nhad diameters ranging from 270 nm to 1 ?m, with a thickness of approximately 45 nm and \n\nestimated PHMB content of ca. 24% (w/w). \n[16]\n\n \n\nBefore the impregnation tests, silica capsules with PHMB were tested against UHP \n\n(500 MPa, 10 min), to evaluate the particles ability to maintain its integrity and stability \n\ntowards high pressure environment. SEM (scan electron microscopy) images were \n\nobtained before and after the UHP treatment (500 MPa, 10 min) (Figure 8. 5). The SEM \n\nimages revealed the integrity of capsules upon UHP treatment. \n\n  \n\n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 8. 5 \u2013 SEM imagens of PHMB silica capsules (a) and PHMB silica capsules submitted to HP (500 MPa, \n\n10 min) (b). \n\nThe impregnation tests with capsules containing PHMB were carried out using the \n\nsame cellulosic pulp and a capsules suspension of 0.1% (w/v). Two sets of samples were \n\nobtained, one impregnated with UHP (PHMB CPs HP) and another impregnated solely by \n\nstirring (PHMB CPs). To evaluate the deposition and distribution of capsules on cellulosic \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 257 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter VIII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Antimicrobial agents \n\nfibres, SEM analysis was carried out (Figure 8. 6) The acquired images clearly showed the \n\ncapsules in both PHMB CPs and PHMB CPs HP samples. This observation is in agreement \n\nwith a good interaction between cellulosic fibres and PHMB capsules, possibly due to \n\ncapsules positive charge surface, suggested previously. \n[16]\n\n \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n \n\n(b) \n\nFigure 8. 6 \u2013SEM images of cellulosic fibres impregnated with silica capsules, without UHP (a) and with UHP \n\ntreatment (b). \n\nThe functionalization of fibres with PHMB capsules was also confirmed by FTIR \n\n(Figure 8. 7). The FTIR spectres revealed a substantial increase at 1028cm\n-1\n\n, which was \n\neven more noticeable on the sample impregnated with UHP (PHMB CPs HP). This \n\nincrease is related to the presence of PHMB silica capsules, namely to the vibrations of Si-\n\nO-Si stretching, from silica,\n[16]\n\n which prompted a significant increment on the a typical \n\ncellulose band attributed to the vibrations of C-O groups. The high intensity at 1028cm\n-1\n\n, \n\nshowed by the spectra of samples treated by UHP suggest the presence of a significant \n\namount of silica capsules with PHMB. This increase in capsules capture is most likely \n\nrelated to the UHP ability to improve fibres accessibility and to facilitate the silica capsules \n\nadsorption on fibres. \n\nMoreover, the aforementioned increases are also accompanied by an increase of \n\nintensity at 556cm\n-1\n\n. It is suggested that this increase may be associated with vibration \n\nfrom oxygen atoms from both silica capsules and cellulose.\n[23,24]\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 258 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter VIII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Antimicrobial agents \n\n \n\nFigure 8. 7 \u2013 Normalized FTIR-ATR spectra of PHMB, PHMB CPs (fibres impregnated conventionally with capsules \n\nwith PHMB), PHMB CPs HP (fibres impregnated with capsules with PHMB by UHP treatment) and E (hardwood pulp). \n\n8.3.2.1 PHMB leaching \n\nThe release of PHMB from functionalized cellulosic fibres was also studied. Thus, \n\nthe release tests were performed in water at room temperature (25\u00b12\u00baC). The achieved \n\nrelease profiles are presented in Figure 8. 8. The curves revealed a similar release profile, \n\nfor both samples, until 20min. After 20 min the release of PHMB was higher from samples \n\ntreated by UHP. This was consistent with the opposite behaviour exhibited by samples \n\nimpregnated with non-encapsulated PHMB (Figure 8. 2). A possible explanation for such \n\nphenomena could be related with the fact that PHMB doesn\u2019t interact with cellulose \n\ndirectly as in previous studies, due to its confinement in the silica capsules. This difference \n\nin scenario allows the diffusion of increased amounts of PHMB, during leaching into \n\nsolution, because PHMB releases by controlled diffusion from capsules and is no longer \n\nhindered by its interaction with cellulose. Consequently, the higher amount of PHMB \n\nreleased by samples impregnated by UHP, indicates the presence of a higher amount of \n\nsilica capsules attached to cellulosic fibres, as proposed by the FTIR results.  \n\nNormally cellulosic fibres exhibit a negative charge over a wide pH range, due to the \n\npresence of ionisable moieties such as carboxyl and hydroxyl groups, resulting from \n\nchemical processing, or from minor polysaccharides such as glucuronoxylans. Similarly, \n\nsilica surfaces in contact with neutral aqueous solutions are also negatively charged. \n[25,26]\n\n \n\nHowever, the presence of PHMB (cationic polymer) in capsules (both encapsulated and on \n\nthe shell pores) grants capsules a positively charged surface.\n[16]\n\n This fact favours the \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 259 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter VIII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Antimicrobial agents \n\ncapsules interaction with cellulose instead of being repealed due to the coulombic \n\nrepulsion.  \n\n \n\nFigure 8. 8 \u2013 PHMB leaching profiles from PHMB CPs and PHMB CPs HP. \n\nPHMB release from capsules sorbed on fibres was further monitored up to 24 h. The \n\namount released from each sample was determined and presented in Table 8. 4. According \n\nto the results obtained it is possible to observe that, even after 24h, PHMB continues to be \n\nreleased from both samples. However, once more, PHMB CPs HP demonstrated superior \n\nrelease of PHMB than PHMB CPs (ca. +66%). \n\nTable 8. 4 \u2013 Amount of PHMB released from PHMB CPs and PHMB CPs HP. \n\nSample mg of PHMB released/Kg of sample Increment (%) \n\nPHMB CPs 179.9\u00b19.0 \n\n+ 66.6 PHMB CPs \n\nHP \n294.6\u00b112.0 \n\nThe leaching assay with PHMB CPs and PHMB CPs HP samples were not \n\ncomplemented with mechanical and physical tests, with paper samples, due to insufficient \n\nmaterials for handsheets preparation. Namely, the reduced amount of capsules that was \n\navailable for the study, which only permitted the preparation of a limited number of \n\nhandsheets used for antimicrobial activity tests. \n\n8.3.2.2 Antimicrobial activity \n\nFibres functionalized with PHMB silica capsules were also tested for antimicrobial \n\nactivity. Handsheets were prepared from both pulp samples. Handsheets of control sample \n\n(pulp impregnated with empty silica capsules) and control HP sample (pulp impregnated \n\nwith empty silica capsules and UHP treatment) were also prepared. \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 260 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter VIII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Antimicrobial agents \n\nThe antimicrobial tests were performed according to norm NP EN ISSO 20743:2009 \n\nwith slight modifications, for the specimens E. coli and L. innocua.

An improved impregnation \n\nof cationic antimicrobial polymer PHMB was demonstrated, thanks to UHP treatment. \n\nPHMB was more strongly attached to cellulosic fibres due to deeper penetration of PHMB \n\nand stronger interaction with cellulosic fibres. Although upon treatment with higher \n\nPHMB dosages, a frailer multilayer of PHMB, formed on the fibres surface would \n\ncontribute to its easier leaching. \n\nNevertheless, even though UHP promoted positive results on PHMB impregnation, \n\npaper strength properties were negatively affected. These were posteriorly attenuated by \n\nreducing PHMB load in the impregnation assays, without affecting antimicrobial features. \n\nIt is suggested that this negative effect of PHMB, on papers strength properties, could be \n\nreduced either by the use of encapsulated PHMB of by the addition of wet and dry \n\nstrength agents (object for further studies). \n\nThe impregnation of microencapsulated PHMB was also demonstrated. It was seen \n\nthat UHP treatment also enhanced the impregnation of capsules. It was suggested that the \n\ncapsules positive charge, together with UHP enhanced accessibility, played a role \n\nenhancing capsules impregnation. Also, in opposite to the impregnation with PHMB \n\nalone, the results demonstrated that since PHMB is no longer interacting directly with \n\ncellulose, its release is controlled by its diffusion from capsules. Additionally, both \n\nsamples impregnated with and without UHP demonstrated antimicrobial activity, which \n\nsuggested that both systems provided PHMB in sufficient amount to inhibit \n\nmicroorganism\u2019s activity. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 262 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter VIII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Antimicrobial agents \n\n8.5 References \n\n[1] Simoncic, B.; Tomsic, B.

Introduction \n\nThe development of new consumer appealing products, such as tissue papers, has \n\nlead companies to research for different additives and methods to produce differentiated \n\nand unique products. \n[1\u20133]\n\n This was highlighted for the case of coloured papers (Chapter 6) \n\nand papers with antimicrobial properties (Chapter 8) and is also true for the case of papers \n\nwith specific odour. Human\u2019s sense of smell identifies not only the quality of different \n\nodours, but also associates it, often unconsciously, with feelings ranging from agreeable to \n\nunpleasant associations. Relying on this many take advantage of it, since perfumed \n\nproducts become more attractive, while dreadful smells are used for the opposite effect. \n[4]\n\n \n\nErgo, it is possible that by appealing to consumer sense of odour a positively impact on its \n\nbuying behaviour may be verified. \n[1]\n\n Many companies have followed this strategy through \n\nthe years, to enhance brand equity, by developing scent based trademark products.\n[5,6]\n\n An \n\nexample of this would be Renova scented tissue papers. \n\nTo confer an appealing smell of freshly washed fabric or of perfume to a substrate, \n\nthis last is commonly treated by spraying, coating or dipping, with a perfume or fragrance. \n\nHowever, the effects of the fragrance on substrates, wear of rapidly. \n[6]\n\n \n\nAs a way to retain longer perfumes on substrate, encapsulation has emerged as a \n\npotential method to enhanced odour durability on perfumed products.\n[6]\n\n Encapsulation \n\nconfers protection to perfumes from surrounding adverse conditions (temperature, pH, \n\nwater, etc), and thus enables a controlled and long perfume release.\n[7\u20139]\n\n Furthermore \n\nencapsulation also facilitates perfumes handling, which is an attractive point due to the \n\nirrigative nature of some fragrances. This approach of fragrances delivery improves its \n\naffinity towards the substrate, enables the reduction of the amount of perfume spent to \n\nembody odour on products (cost effective) and controls perfume release when \n\nnecessary.\n[2,8\u201310]\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 270 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter IX | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Perfumes \n\n9.2. Materials and Methods \n\nSimilar to previous studies on the impregnation of additives, conventional industrial \n\nbleached kraft pulp (E) was used as reference raw material. This pulp and fragrance \n\nDovena new, DN, (Symrise, Inc.) were kindly provided by RENOVA-FPA, SA. \n\n9.2.1. Synthesis of Dovena new silica capsules \n\n? Hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, 95%, Sigma-Aldrich) \n\n? Ammonia solution (25 \u201328%, Sigma-Aldrich) \n\n? Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich)  \n\n? Cyclohexane 99.9% (Merck).  \n\nSilica capsules with Dovena new (Si DN), were prepared by oil in water emulsion, \n\nusing CTAB\n \nas surfactants, cyclohexane as co-solvent and an ammonia solution as \n\ncatalyst. An oil phase was prepared by dissolving 5 mL of Dovena new in 20 mL of \n\ncyclohexane. Afterwards the water phase was prepared by adding 100 mg of CTAB to 35 \n\nmL of water and 0.25 mL of NH4OH. The oil phase was added to the water phase, under \n\nstirring and an oil-in-water micro-emulsion was achieved. Then 2.0 mL of TEOS was \n\nadded to the o/w micro-emulsion under vigorous stirring and kept in a closed vessel for 24 \n\nh. The precipitate was then filtered, washed and dried at 60 \no\nC. Some of these capsules \n\nwere then subjected to calcination at 550 \u00baC, with a heat integrate of 5 \u00baC/min, to \n\ninvestigate the perfume load on capsules. Also empty silica capsules were produced by \n\nperforming the same experimental method but instead of Dovena new aqueous solution, \n\nthe same volume of cyclohexane was used. \n\n9.2.2. Capsules characterization \n\n9.2.2.1. SEM \n\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of capsules was also performed in \n\nscanning electron microscope Hitachi S4100, at an accelerating voltage of 25 kV on carbon \n\nsputtered samples. For this analysis a diluted dispersion of capsules was prepared and \n\ndeposited on a silica lamella, previously attached to a SEM support with carbon tape. \n\nThen, samples were carbon sputtered. \n\nIn the case of handsheets of pulp impregnated with capsules (section 9.2.3.1.), those \n\nwere analysed in the same equipment at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. In this case \n\nsmall pieces of sample were attached to a SEM support by carbon tape and then subjected \n\nto Au/Pd sputtering before SEM analysis. \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 271 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter IX | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Perfumes \n\n9.2.2.2. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) \n\nThermogravimetric analyses were performed on a Sataram Labsys system under air \n\natmosphere, with a heating rate of 10 \u00baC/min in the temperature range of 20 \u2013800 \u00baC. \n\n9.2.2.3. Zeta potential \n\nZeta potential analysis was performed on a Malvern Zeta Sizer Nano Series \n\napparatus, using disposable plastic cells on capsules diluted dispersions. Complementarily \n\neach solution pH was also measured using a pH Meter, model HI2020 - edge\u00ae \n\nmultiparameter, from Hanna Instruments. \n\n9.2.3. Samples preparation \n\n9.2.3.1. Samples impregnated with DN \n\nFor samples preparation, pulp was dispersed in distilled water (2% consistency), then \n\nDN was added to adjust the load of 5% (wperfume/wpulp). Two sets of samples were prepared, \n\none was subjected to UHP (500 MPa, 10 min), while the other was only subjected to \n\nstirring for the same time. The UHP conditions used had in consideration results achieved \n\nin previous chapters, as regards the determination of the most advantageous UHP \n\nconditions, upon the impregnation of other additives. \n\nSamples treated with UHP were placed into HDPE containers, vacuum sealed and \n\nwere then submitted to UHP treatment (500 MPa, 10 min) on a Hyperbaric model 55 \n\nequipment. On the other hand, samples impregnated without UHP were left stirring for 10 \n\nmin (the same amount of time spent on the UHP treatment). After the impregnation \n\nsamples were used to prepare standard handsheets according with norm ISO 5269-2. \n\n9.2.3.2. Samples impregnated with Si DN \n\nTo prepare samples impregnated with capsules, pulp was dispersed in distilled water \n\n(2% consistency), then Si DN were added making up a load of 5% (wSiDN/wpulp). Two \n\nreplicas were prepared, one was subjected to UHP (500 MPa, 10 min), while another was \n\nsubjected to agitation only, for the same time. Samples treated with UHP were placed into \n\nHDPE containers, sealed and then submitted to UHP (500 MPa, 10 min) on a Hyperbaric \n\nmodel 55, Burgos, Spain, equipment. On the other hand, samples impregnated without \n\nUHP were left stirring for 10min. Afterwards samples were used to prepare standard \n\nhandsheets according with norm ISO 5269-2: 2004. These sheets were also analysed by \n\nSEM by placing a small cut of paper sheet on carbon tape already attached to a SEM \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 272 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter IX | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Perfumes \n\nsupport. Then samples were carbon sputtered and analysed in the same equipment, \n\npreviously mentioned, at 15 kV. \n\n9.2.4. Fourier transform infrared - FTIR \n\nFourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the paper samples were collected using \n\na spectrometer from Perkin Elmer, model Spectrum BX coupled to a horizontal attenuated \n\ntotal reflectance (ATR) cell, using 256 scans at a resolution of 4 cm\n-1\n\n. The spectres were \n\nnormalized according with 2900 cm\n-1\n\n band (C\u2013H stretching vibration). \n\n9.2.5. Total organic compounds (TOC) analysis \n\nThe amount of volatile organic compounds released by each samples was analysed \n\non Laborat\u00f3rio da Qualidade do Ar Interior (IDMEC-Instituto de Engenharia Mec\u00e2nica \u2013 \n\nFEUP, University of Porto). Thus, samples (handsheets) were reduced to smaller pieces, \n\nplaced in impingers and subjected to N2 purging, to drag volatile compounds into Tenax \n\nTA tubes for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) determination. The identification and \n\nquantification by a selective mass detector was performed using a chromatographer from \n\nAgilent Technologies model 6890N and a mass selective detector from the same brand, \n\nmodel 5973. All analyses were performed following norm ISO 16000-6. The analysis was \n\npreceded by thermal desorption from Tenax Tubes by means of a desorption system from \n\nDANI, model STD 33.50, coupled to the GC equipment. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 273 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter IX | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Perfumes \n\n9.3. Results and Discussion \n\nThe impregnation of cellulosic fibres with perfumes was performed following \n\ndifferent approaches, one with perfume and the other with encapsulated perfume, with and \n\nwithout UHP treatment. Prior to any impregnation the capsules used for the impregnation \n\nof cellulosic fibres were characterized. It is noteworthy that the capsules employed on \n\nfibres impregnation were prepared, characterized and provided by collaborators, which \n\nwork is still pending for publication. \n\n9.3.1. Capsules characterization \n\n9.3.1.1. Silica capsules with Dovena New (Si DN) \n\nThe provided capsules were analysed by SEM to evaluate its morphology. The \n\nacquired images are presented in Figure 9. 1. Although a population of capsules is \n\nobserved, in these images it is still possible to observe a high amount of unpolymerized \n\nTEOS. \n\n \n\nFigure 9. 1 \u2013 SEM images of Si DN. \n\nCapsules thermal stability and its  perfume content were also investigated by TGA \n\nanalysis. The TGA analysis was performed on Si DN (silica capsules with Dovena new \n\nencapsulated), Si Calcined (calcined capsules) and on Si empty (empty capsules) (Figure 9. \n\n2). \n\n \n\nFigure 9. 2 \u2013TGA thermogram from Si DN capsules, Si Calcined capsules and Si empty capsules. \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 274 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter IX | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Perfumes \n\nBased on the TGA thermograms, it was possible to identify at ca. 100\u00baC a weight \n\nloss in each system (Si DN, Si calcined and Si empty) related with water molecules \n\nvaporization, along with volatile compound release, existing within the capsules. By \n\ncomparing Si calcined with Si empty it was possible that the observed weight loss (ca. \n\n19%) was mostly attributed to the degradation of TEOS, in the range of 225-275 \u00baC, that \n\nwas not hydrolysed nor condensed during the synthesis reaction, along with the \n\ndegradation of residual surfactants. \n\nAs concerns Si DN, the thermogram differs from Si empty, and the differences \n\nshould be associated with the degradation of the fragrance compounds (complex mixture). \n\nThe weight loss on the above mentioned temperature range is higher for Si DN reaching \n\n67%. The difference in weight between Si empty and Si DN could be useful for the \n\ndetermination on the amount of fragrance encapsulated, which, in agreement with TGA, \n\nwas of ca. 48% (w/w). \n\nThe Si DN capsules were also analysed for its zeta potential. The results revealed \n\npositively charged capsules, with a zeta potential of +36.2\u00b11.9 mV (pH 6.1). This results \n\nsuggests the presence of positively charged surfactant CTAB, on the capsules surface, even \n\nafter capsules washing. \n\n9.3.2. Fibres impregnated with Si DN \n\nThe fibres samples impregnated with silica capsules containing DN were analysed by \n\nSEM, to identify the presence of the capsules on the fibres. SEM images were achieved for \n\nboth samples impregnated with and without UHP treatment. The images achieved are \n\npresented in Figure 9. 3. In both samples it was possible to identify the presence of the \n\nparticles Si DN, meaning that adsorption on fibres succeeded, in both cases. \n\n \n\nFigure 9. 3 \u2013 SEM images of the silica capsules in samples PHMB CPs (a) and PHMB CPs HP (b). \n\nThe presence of capsules on fibres was also monitored by FTIR (Figure 9. 4). The \n\nFTIR spectres of Si DN HP (fibres impregnated with capsules by UHP treatment) revealed \n\na slightly higher intensity at 1023cm\n-1\n\n, when compared with Si DN (fibres impregnated \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 275 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter IX | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Perfumes \n\nwith capsules without UHP treatment). This peak is related not only with the vibrations of \n\nC-O groups from cellulose, but also with the vibration of Si-O-Si stretching from silica. \n\n[11,12]\n Thus, it is possible that the slightly increased intensity of Si-O-Si band in sample Si \n\nDN HP may indicate the presence of higher content of silica capsules, comparatively to Si \n\nDN.  \n\nAdditionally, at 557cm\n-1\n\n samples impregnated with UHP treatment (Si DN HP), also \n\nrevealed slightly higher intensities, when compared with samples impregnated without \n\nUHP treatment (Si DN). It is suggested that this may be associated with vibration from \n\noxygen atoms from silica capsules.\n[11,12]\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9. 4 - Normalized FTIR-ATR spectra of Si DN (fibres impregnated conventionally with capsules with Dovena \n\nnew), Si DN HP (fibres impregnated with capsules with Dovena new by UHP treatment) and E (hardwood pulp). \n\n9.3.2.1. Perfume release studies \n\nPulp samples impregnated with Si DN and perfume alone, with and without UHP \n\ntreatment were evaluated for their retention of both capsules and the fragrance alone. The \n\ntotal volatile compounds were quantified by TOC analysis, on FEUP\u2019s air analysis \n\nLaboratory, following the ISO 16000-6 (2011) norm. To simplify, samples were \n\ndesignated as described in Table 9. 1.  \n\nTable 9. 1 \u2013 Samples designations. \n\nSample Description \n\nDN Virgin fibres impregnated with fragrance by stirring for 10 min \n\nDN HP Virgin fibres impregnated with fragrance by UHP treatment (500 MPa, 10 min) \n\nSi DNs Virgin fibres impregnated with silica nanocapsules (with encapsulated fragrance), by \n\nstirring for 10 min \n\nSi DN HP Virgin fibres impregnated with silica nanocapsules (with encapsulated fragrance) with \n\nUHP treatment (500 MPa, 10 min) \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 276 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter IX | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Perfumes \n\nThe results achieved regarding the TOC analysis (total organic carbon) are presented \n\nin Table 9. 2.The results obtained revealed that, overall, pulp samples impregnated with \n\nDN or Si DN, by UHP treatment, demonstrated higher VOC (volatile organic compounds) \n\nrelease, relatively to those untreated by UHP. The higher release of VOCs (almost two \n\ntimes) on samples treated with UHP treatment was attributed to a higher sorption of \n\nperfume or encapsulated perfume (capsules) on cellulosic fibres. These results are in \n\nagreement with enhanced accessibility and diminished electrokinetic potential of fibres as \n\ndiscussed in previous chapters. Furthermore, in the case of encapsulated perfume in silica \n\ncapsules, its positive charge may also exhibit affinity for negatively charged cellulosic \n\nfibres. Hence, it may be proposed, also, the improved affinity of fibres for silica particles, \n\nsince more fragrance was released from fibres doped with capsules, after UHP treatment \n\n(Si DN HP), than without UHP treatment (Si DN). \n\nAdditionally, as expected, pulp functionalized with capsules released higher perfume \n\ncontent than pulp solely treated directly with perfume. Perfume volatile compounds escape \n\nrather easily from fibres. However, upon encapsulation, even though perfumes percentage \n\ncorrespond to half of capsules weight, the release is controlled being protected from \n\nsurrounding severe conditions during handsheet preparation process and rendered high \n\nperfume release. \n\nTable 9. 2 \u2013VOCs release from samples impregnated with DN and encapsulated DN, with and without UHP. \n\n Concentration (?g/m\n3\n) \n\nCompound DN DN HP Si DN Si DN HP \n\nButanol 9.08 13.3 n.d. 11.6 \n\n1-hexenol n.d. n.d. n.d. 5.40 \n\nLimonene 0.81 n.d. 0.39 1.58 \n\nDecamethylcyclopentasiloxane n.d. n.d. 9.63 4.56 \n\n4-tert-buthylciclohexyl acetate n.d. n.d. 6.04 12.5 \n\nDiphenyl ether n.d. n.d. 0.21 0.38 \n\n?-cedrene n.d. n.d. 0.76 1.99 \n\nThujopsene n.d. n.d. 1.26 2.83 \n\nVOCs 16.0 31.8 27.7 60.8 \n\n*n.d. = not detected     \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 277 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter IX | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Perfumes \n\n9.4. Conclusions \n\nThe impregnation of perfume and perfume containers on cellulosic fibres was \n\nperformed with success, with and without UHP treatment. UHP aptitude to improve the \n\nefficacy of impregnation, not only of volatile compounds (perfume DN), but also of its \n\nencapsulated version was demonstrated. This allowed to demonstrate UHP potential \n\ntowards other chemical systems such as VOCs and nanocarriers (capsules). \n\nAdditionally, the use of perfume capsules enabled a higher perfume retention and \n\nthus a higher release of this last with time, relatively to samples impregnated solely with \n\nperfume. \n\nMoreover, the impregnation of cellulosic fibres, meant for tissue paper production, \n\nwith encapsulated perfume, opens the possibility for products with high perfume content \n\n(more intense scent), without the usual excess of perfume (high spent on raw materials) \n\nrequired to maintain the scent intensity with time. Also, besides dosing and preventing the \n\nimmediate release of all perfumes compound (controlled release), it is possible that it may \n\nalso attenuate irritation reactions derived from skin direct contact with perfume \n\ncompounds. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 278 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter IX | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Perfumes \n\n9.5.

It \n\nwas demonstrated that the UHP induce forced hydration and rearrangements on cellulose \n\nfibrils. These rearrangements led to partial cocrystallization of conveniently oriented \n\ncrystalline regions, resulting in it enlargement. Also, UHP treatment induced fibrils \n\ndisaggregation, and thus enhanced cellulose accessibility. The enhancement of fibres \n\naccessibility was demonstrated by various techniques. In the case of recycled fibres, these \n\nresults suggest a substantial reduction of hornification of fibres, which was demonstrated \n\nby the improved hydration abilities of recycled fibres.  \n\nIt was demonstrated that UHP treatment also induces forced hydration and thus the \n\nformation of strongly bound water. Although identified its rigorous quantification was not \n\npossible. It was proposed that at least part of this strongly bound water is presented in the \n\nform of thermodynamically stable clathrate hydrates. As consequence, part of OH groups \n\nin cellulose became inaccessible. As future work it would be suggested a more advanced \n\nanalysis over the quantification of strongly bound water on fibres, upon different UHP \n\ntreatment conditions (time and pressure), and on the structure of formed clathrate hydrates. \n\nThe effect of UHP on the papermaking properties of fibres was also examined. The \n\nsynergetic effect found, due to the combination of beating with UHP treatment, was \n\nespecially witnessed for recycled fibres. Its capillary rise increased remarkably (more than \n\ndouble) and its refinability suggests up to 50% saving in energy. Besides the enhanced \n\nhydration skills of fibres, basic papermaking properties demonstrated either similar of \n\nimproved values. Based on the strength and hydration properties gains and losses, for \n\ntissue paper production it is suggested that for recycled fibres the most indicated sequence \n\nwas B1-HP-B2 (pre-beating stage, followed by UHP and by a last beating stage). \n\nNevertheless, the best desired properties of papers will be dependent of pulp origin and the \n\nbeating sequence applied under particularly optimized conditions. Due to the complexity of \n\nintroducing a UHP equipment on a production line of tissue paper, further studies are \n\nsuggested to evaluate its costs/benefits. \n\nThe structural changes induced by UHP was also demonstrated as a way to improve \n\nfibres accessibility towards different chemicals (dyes, humectants, antimicrobials and \n\nperfumes), enzymes and nanostructures. In the case of enzymes, it was found that the \n\ncombination of enzymatic treatment with UHP led towards a significant improvement over \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 284 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter X | Final remarks and future outlook \n\nxylan removal, due to improved accessibility. It was also suggested that the enzymatic \n\nmodification improved significantly the papermaking properties of recycled pulp. These \n\nimprovements were related with the selective removal of xylan bound to impurities and to \n\naggregated cellulose fibrils, on the fibre surface, thus favouring the ensuing swelling and \n\ninter-fibre bonding in paper. The pre-treatment of pulp with UHP and posterior enzymatic \n\ntreatment revealed a synergetic effect on the mechanical properties of recycled pulp, which \n\nwas attributed to the enhanced accessibility of fibres towards xylanase by forced hydration \n\nand favourable rearrangement of cellulosic fibrils in fibres after UHP pre-treatment. The \n\nincrease of strength properties as result of UHP and xylanase treatment was up to 30%. \n\nHowever, in the case of recycled fibres, due to the reaction conditions (mildly acid media \n\nwithout surfactant), brightness was negatively affected, due to the re-precipitation of \n\nchromophore containing concomitants and loss of optical brightening agents. Therefore, \n\nnew studies may be suggested, under different pH conditions to revaluate the effect of \n\nUHP and xylanase on recycled fibres brightness. It is also suggested studies to evaluate the \n\ncombination of UHP treatment with other enzymes, to enhance recycled fibres quality (e.g. \n\nlipases). \n\nThe impregnation of dyes with UHP also demonstrated remarkable results, with \n\nenhanced impregnation of dye molecules and thus more intense colour shades. However, \n\nthe equilibrium between the different agents during dyeing (dye, fixative and cellulose) \n\nwas proved to be rather sensitive to UHP treatment, depending on the dye used. Therefore, \n\nit is suggested, either studies with a dye with known molecular structure and properties, or \n\nfurther insights and analysis upon the dyes used, namely, as regards their molecular \n\nstructure, its affinity and substantivity towards cellulose, its interaction with fixative \n\nagents, etc. \n\nThe enhanced impregnation of additives by UHP treatment was also demonstrated \n\nwith humectants. The use of UHP treatment not only improved impregnation, but it also \n\nresulted in the enhancement of cellulose hydrophilic character, which is a rather relevant \n\naspect, in what concerns tissue papers. Although, fibres revealed improved hydration \n\nskills, losses in some papers strength properties were found. These losses were attenuated \n\nby decreasing humectants dosage, however, new studies are suggested to test other \n\nhumectants and achieve an optimized formulation, in order to surpass the abovementioned \n\nnegative effects. In another approach, it is also suggested, as future work, new tests \n\nconsidering the humectants used combined with dry- or wet-strength agents. \n\nIn another context the impregnation of the antimicrobial agent, cationic polymer \n\nPHMB (polyhexamethylene biguanide), with UHP revealed enhanced impregnation with \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 285 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter X | Final remarks and future outlook \n\nhigher PHMB retention/fixation during leaching. This was attributed to a stronger and \n\nmore effective impregnation of this compound due to UHP and PHMB cationic charge. \n\nNevertheless, negative effects were produced on paper strength properties due to the \n\ndisruptive action of PHMB. This was attenuated upon the decrease of PHMB dosage, \n\nwithout affecting the samples antimicrobial abilities, Nevertheless, new studies are \n\nsuggested, with other antimicrobial agents, in order to confer paper antimicrobial \n\nproperties, without affecting its strength properties. The conjugation with wet and/or dry \n\nstrength additives is also suggested as future work. \n\nSimilarly to the previous case, silica encapsulated PHMB also revealed higher \n\nretention upon UHP, although a higher release of PHMB was verified. This opposite trend, \n\nrelatively to the previous case, was attributed to PHMB not interacting directly with \n\ncellulose, turning its release diffusion dependent. Thus, the enhanced impregnation of \n\ncapsules, due to UHP treatment, resulted in higher capsules retention together with higher \n\nPHMB release. Since, in these studies it was not possible to evaluate paper strength \n\nproperties, due to limited access to PHMB capsules, it is suggested its evaluation, when \n\ncapsules synthesis is optimized. \n\nSimilarly, to PHMB capsules, encapsulated perfumes (Dovena New), revealed higher \n\nimpregnation upon UHP, confirming UHP ability to improve fibres accessibility, not only \n\ntowards chemicals, but also towards different nanostructures. This was mirrored by a \n\nhigher release of volatiles from samples impregnated with this nanomaterials, upon UHP. \n\nTaking into consideration, not only the results achieved on the impregnation of \n\nadditives with UHP treatment, but also the synergetic effect of beating with UHP \n\ntreatment, further studies are proposed, as future work, to evaluate the effect of combining \n\nbeating with UHP treatment, on the impregnation of additives in cellulosic fibres. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 286 ~ \n\n \n\n Chapter X | Final remarks and future outlook \n\n \n\n\n\n__________Appendices_ \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 288 ~ \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n~ 289 ~ \n\n \n\nA.
