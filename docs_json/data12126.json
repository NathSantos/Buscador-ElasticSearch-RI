Introduction\n\nCommercial coal production in the southern region of Brazil (com-\nprising the Paran\u00e1, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul states) \nhas been occurring since the beginning of the twentieth century. \nSpecifically in the Santa Catarina State, the production occurs at \nthe \u201cIrapu\u00e1\u201d, \u201cBonito\u201d, and mainly \u201cBarro Branco\u201d seams. These \nGondwanic coals are classified for the major part as a high-vol-\natile bituminous in rank. The thickness of the Barro Branco seam \nranges from 1.66 to 2.27 m, with an average value of 1.80 m. How-\never, net clean coal thickness is reduced to 0.47\u20131.48 m, due to \nthe presence of alternating layers of impure coal (shaley coal and \ncoaly shale), carbonaceous shale, siltstone, and sandstones. Py-\nrite lenses that are several centimeters thick are also common [1].\nCurrently, the run-of-mine coal (ROM) is gravimetrically concen-\ntrated and almost entirely used for electricity generation. Due to \nthe geological characteristics of the region, large amounts of solid \nwastes are generated.  It is estimated that more than 300 million \nmetric tons of coal waste exist in the south of Brazil, generating \nenvironmental impacts and economic costs. Regarding the San-\nta Catarina Coalfields, about 60%\u201365% of the ROM coal is dis-\ncharged at dump deposits as waste [2]. These wastes can lead to \nthe formation of acid mine drainage (AMD), a source of groundwa-\nter and surface water pollution [3]. \nThrough gravity concentration processes of coal waste from Barro \nBranco seam, it is possible to produce three output streams: (i) a \nlow-specific-gravity material composed of shaley coal and carbo-\nnaceous shale; (ii) an intermediate material composed of siltstone \nand sandstone; and (iii) a high-specific-gravity material that is rich \nin pyrite. Presently, there are some initiatives in Brazil to reprocess \nsome coal waste deposits to recover part of the carbonaceous \nmaterials for energy production and, alternatively, to concentrate \nthe pyrite for sulfuric acid production. However, the intermediate-\ndensity material still remains, which represents 50%\u201360% in mass \nof the coal waste deposit and can be considered as a material for \npossible use in civil construction [4]. Mining wastes has been con-\nsidered worldwide as a material for aggregate production [5,6,7], \nincluding coal wastes (colliery spoil) [8].  \nConcrete paving blocks can be used in a large range of applica-\ntions. The conventional source of fine aggregates for paving blocks \nare river sand or, alternatively, artificial sand obtained by crushing \nrocks [9]. However, previous research has shown that it is pos-\nsible to use some wastes to produce concrete paving blocks, for \nexample, gasification residues [10], construction and demolition \nwaste [11,12], ceramic tile production wastes [13], marble pro-\nduction wastes [14], recycled glass [15], polypropylene fiber [16], \ncrushed brick [17], electric-arc furnace dust [18], red mud [19], and \nfly ash [19].\nAccording to the Brazilian standard NBR 9781 [20], the compres-\nsion resistance of concrete blocks for paving should meet the mini-\nmum of 35 MPa for pedestrian and commercial vehicles and 50 \nMPa for heavy-duty vehicles.  The same limit of 35 MPa is used \nby Thailand [21]. Other countries allow lower resistances, like India \n(30 MPa) [22], Sri Lanka (15 MPa for pedestrians) [23], and Indo-\nnesia (20 MPa) [24], or require higher resistances, like USA (55.2 \nMPa) [25] and UK (49 MPa) [26]. \nThus, the aim of this work was to study the use of coal waste to \nproduce concrete blocks for paving. A procedure to process the \ncoal waste with the purpose of reducing the sulfur content and \n\nchanging the particle size distribution of the material to meet the \nspecification for fine aggregates was developed. Additionally, the \ncoal waste aggregate was characterized in terms of its chemical \nand physical properties. The article evaluates the main technical \nand environmental parameters that are involved in recycling part of \nthe coal waste and aimed at turning it into a useful product.\n\n2. Materials and experimental program\n\nCoal waste was collected from the coal dump deposit of the \n\u201cVerdinho mine,\u201d Santa Catarina State, Brazil, which extracts the \nBarro Branco seam. The material was submitted to a laboratory \ndense medium separation processing, using organic liquids, which \naimed at obtaining a fraction with relative density between 2.4 and \n2.8 [27]. This fraction was crushed in a roller mill and sieved to \nreach the particle size distribution required for fine aggregates in \nconcrete, according to NBR 7211 [28]. The mineral-processing \nsteps to produce the coal waste fine aggregate from coal mining \ntailings are presented in Figure 1.\nQuartz river sand was obtained from Jacu\u00ed River, Rio Grande \ndo Sul State. Technological characterization of both materials \nincluded particle size distribution, density measurements, vi-\nsual observation in a petrographic magnifying lens, and mineral \nphase determination by x-ray diffraction. Determination of sul-\nfate and chloride ions was conducted following the procedure \n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Mineral-processing steps \nto produce coal waste fine aggregate \n\nfrom coal mining tailings\n\n15IBRACON Structures and Materials Journal \u2022 2015 \u2022 vol. 8  \u2022 n\u00ba 1\n\nC.

Elemental analyses of the fine \naggregates were carried out by x-ray fluorescence (for Si, Fe, \nAl, Ca, and K) and high-temperature decomposition in a CHNS \nanalyzer (for C, H, N, and S).  The main characteristics of both \nmaterials are summarized in Table 1.\nConcrete paving blocks were produced in a vertical shaft con-\ncrete mixer. The reference trace used 5.36 kg of cement (CP-V-\nARI-RS), 6.26 kg of coarse granitic aggregate, 14.18 kg of river \nsand aggregate, and a water/cement ratio of 0.35. Chemical \nproperties of the cement are presented in Table 2. Coal waste \nwas used as a substitute for river sand aggregate, considering \nthe following volumetric levels of substitution: 0%, 25%, 50%, \n75%, and 100%. For each level of substitution, the water/ce-\nment ratio was reestablished to provide the same consistency \nof concrete [30]. The concrete blocks were molded in manual \npress equipment with a production capacity of six blocks per \ncycle. The blocks were molded in the \u201cunipaver\u201d shape with \nthe following dimensions: 22.5 cm length, 12.0 cm width, and \n8 cm height (Figure 2). The technological characterization of \nthe paving blocks included resistance to compression, abrasion \nresistance and water absorption. It was produced 90 blocks for \ncompression resistance, 10 blocks for abrasion resistance, and \n10 blocks for water absorption tests. The results of compression \nresistance are the average of six test results (n= 6 for each level \n\nof substitution and each curing period) and the curing periods \nwere 7, 28, and 90 days. Abrasion resistance and water absorp-\ntion were carried out in two concrete blocks (n=2) resulting from \neach level of substitution at a curing period of 28 days.

Abrasion resistance was \ndetermined according to the CIENTEC method. The procedure \nconsists of dividing a paving block specimen into two pieces with \na diamond saw. Each piece is placed to a rotatory machineand \nsubmitted to a constant pressure of 0.06 MPa in the presence \nof an abrasive powder (silicon carbide). The aim is to simulate a \npathway of 500 m. The width of the paving block was measured \nbefore and after the experiment in five positions of each paving \nblock piece. The wear rate result, expressed in millimeters, is the \nmean of 10 measurements.\nThe acid generation potential of the raw waste, coal waste fine ag-\ngregates, and blocks with 25% and 50% substitution of river sand \nby coal waste fine aggregate at 28 days was measured by the \ntraditional method of accounting for acids and bases (ABA) [33]. \nThe objective was to determine the balance between the minerals \nthat produce acidity (acidity potential - AP) and the minerals that \nconsume acidity (neutralization potential - NP). The determination \n\nof acidity potential (AP) was carried out from the analysis of total \nsulfur using a CHNS analyzer. AP was calculated by the following \nconversion factor: \n\n(1)AP = 31.25 \u00d7 %S\n\nTo determine the neutralizing potential (NP), the procedure con-\nsisted of subjecting the sample to an acidic solution followed by \ntitration of the acid solution with sodium hydroxide (with the same \nconcentration as that of the acid) to pH 7.0. The net neutralization \npotential (NNP) was calculated from the difference between NP \nand AP:\n\n(2)NNP = NP \u2013 AP\n\nA sample is classified as acid forming when it has NNP values \nless than -20 CaCO3/t and non-acid forming when it has NNP val-\nues greater than +20 CaCO3/t. Samples are classified as uncertain \nwhen their values range from -20 to +20 CaCO3/t.\nA kinetic test in humidity cells following the ASTM D 5744-96 [34] \nmethod was carried out to evaluate the chemical stability of the \nsamples. The test consisted of placing 500 g of the material, with \nparticle size between 6.3 mm and 2.0 mm, in a column with an \ninternal diameter of 5 cm and a height of 30 cm. The test was car-\nried out with the raw waste, coal waste fine aggregate, reference \nblock, and block with 50% substitution of river sand by coal waste \nfine aggregate. During the seven-day cycle, dry air was passed \nthrough the column for the first three days and humidified air for the \nnext three days. On the seventh day, the sample was rinsed with \n500 mL of distilled water. The leachate was collected and analyzed \nfor the AMD typical parameters: pH, Eh, acidity, alkalinity, concen-\ntration of metals (Fe, Al, Mn, Zn, and Ca), and concentration of \nsulfate. The procedures followed the Standard Methods for the \nExamination of Water and Wastewater [35] and the results were \nexpressed in terms of average values of twenty weeks (n=20).\n\n3. Results and discussion\n\nFigure 3 presents particle size distribution of the coal waste fine \naggregate as well as the river sand. Both materials have their size \ndistribution from 0.15 to 4.0 mm.  However, the D50 (grain diameter \nat which 50% of the mass sample is retained or passed by the \nsieve) of the coal waste fine aggregate was 0.4 mm and the D50 of \nthe river sand was 1.0 mm. So, compared to the river sand used \nin this work the coal waste fine aggregate has a higher amount of \nfiner particles. It can be also observed that both materials, sepa-\nrately, fit in the applicable zone, but not completely in optimal zone. \nHowever, the mixture composed by 50% coal waste and 50% river \nsand allows a particle size distribution entirely inside the optimal \nzone as prescribed by NBR 7211 [28].\nThe x-ray pattern of coal waste and the river sand applied in this \nwork are depicted in Figure 4. The mineral fine aggregates pro-\nduced from the coal waste have quartz as their major crystalline \n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Concrete paving blocks produced \nwith varied levels of substitution\n\n\n\n18 IBRACON Structures and Materials Journal \u2022 2015 \u2022 vol. 8  \u2022 n\u00ba 1\n\nMineral processing and characterization of coal waste to be used as fine aggregates for concrete \npaving blocks \n\nphase. The presence of kaolinite, illite, and gypsum was also de-\ntected as well as amorphous components. River sand aggregate \nis basically composed of quartz. The particles of coal waste are \nangular in shape, due to the rock fragmentation procedure, and \ngrayish in color. In contrast, river sand particles are rounded/sub-\nrounded and yellowish in color (Figure 5).\nThe concentration of sulfate ions in the fine coal aggregate was \ndetermined to be 1.00%, whereas in the river sand it were not \ndetected (<0.01%). Chloride ions were not detected in fine coal \naggregate and river sand. Sulfate is considered to be harmful for \nconcretes, and it is  recommended that the values of sulfates and \nsulfides in aggregates for concrete production should not exceed \nthe value of 1% (mass) [36,37]. The concentration of sulfates was \nsufficiently low to be used for paving blocks production. However, \nthe concentration of total sulfur was determined as 1.9%. Thus, \nfor safety reasons, the fine aggregate produced from coal tailings \nshould be applied in levels of river sand substitution of no more \nthan 25% or 50%.\nThe preparation of concrete with coal waste in all levels of substi-\ntution was simple. Coal waste particles mixed properly with river \nsand and allowed a mixture without sights of bleeding and seg-\nregation. However, increasing the amount of coal waste particles \nin the fine aggregate, more water was necessary to maintain the \nsame consistency of fresh concrete. It was expected because coal \nwaste particles are more angular in shape and smaller in size.  \nTable 3 shows the main technological properties of concrete blocks \nfor paving, while considering the different levels of substitution. It \n\nis possible to observe that, increasing the level of substitution, \nthere is an increase in the water/cement ratio and a decrease in \nthe cement consumption. It can be observed that concrete blocks \nproduced with substitution levels of 25% and 50%, at 28 days, sta-\ntistically present behavior similar to the reference blocks (0% sub-\nstitution) in terms of compressive resistance, abrasion resistance, \nand water absorption.\nIn terms of compression resistance, most of the blocks manufac-\ntured with 0%, 25% and 50% substitution attained the minimum \nvalue of 35 MPa established by NBR 9781 [20] for commercial \nstandard vehicles. The blocks produced with substitution levels of \n75% and 100% did not reach the required compression resistance. \nThe loss in compression resistance in paving blocks with increas-\ning levels of substitution of river sand by alternative aggregates \nhas been observed in other situations, including crushed clay brick \n[11], ceramic tile waste [13], waste marble [14], and demolition ma-\nterials [12]. It was also observed a small decrease, but statistically \nsignificant, in compression resistance from 28 to 90 days in the \npaving blocks with any amount of coal waste. \nIncreasing the level of substitution the abrasion resistance de-\ncreases. However, according to statistical analysis, the results \nwere the same for the levels of substitution of 0%, 25%, 50%, and \n75%. Blocks with 100% substitution of river sand presented sig-\nnificant difference compared to the others and, therefore, unsat-\nisfactory results. Waste utilization in concrete production can be \nbeneficial or harmful to abrasion resistance.

However, the in-\ncrease of water absorption for blocks with 25% to 50% coal \n\nwaste is very low. The values of water absorption in reference \nblocks and with levels of substitution of 0%, 25% and 50% are \nstatistically the same while blocks with levels of substitution of \n75% and 100% are statistically different. The same behavior \nwas observed when using bottom ash [45] and recycled fine ag-\ngregates from construction and demolition waste [46].

The paving blocks produced with 25% and 50% \nsubstitution of river sand by coal waste fine aggregate presented \na NNP that was positive and higher than 400 kg CaCO3/t. These \n\nFigure 5 \u2013 Pictures showing the morphological characteristics \nof coal waste fine aggregate and river sand\n\nresults showed that the manufacture of paving blocks provided an \nalkaline environment and prevented acid generation.\nA twenty weeks period test in humidity cells was carried out to con-\nfirm this.

The pH ranged \nfrom 3.3 to 1.3 for the raw waste and from 4.0 to 2.6 for the coal \nwaste fine aggregate. For the concrete blocks, in all situations, the \nwater pH remained neutral or slightly alkaline, with the following \npH ranges: 11.8 and 8.3 for the reference blocks and 10.3 and \n7.0 for blocks with 50% substitution.

The encapsulation \nof some remaining pyrite grains into the paving blocks avoids their \ncontact with atmospheric oxygen and water, inhibiting pyrite oxida-\ntion reactions. Table 5 presents the average values of chemical \nparameters analyzed on the leachate considering raw coal waste \nparticles, coal waste fine aggregate, paving blocks with 50% substi-\ntution, and reference paving blocks (100% river sand).  The leach-\nate of raw coal waste has a low pH and a very high concentration \nof metals and sulfates. This is what happens in sulfide mining sites \nand it is typically named \u201cacid rock drainage\u201d. The procedure ap-\nplied to prepare the coal waste fine aggregate by density separa-\ntion, allowed to reduce in 73% the concentration of pyritic sulfur. So, \nin this case, the leachates were less intense in terms of medium \nacidification and the release of metals and sulfate. Incorporating \n\nthe coal waste in concrete in a proportion of 50%, acidification was \navoided as well the metal leaching. Comparing the leached water \nof the concrete produced with 100% river sand with the concrete \nproduced with coal waste in a level of 50% substitution, the results \nwere quite similar. However, in the latter was observed a higher \namount of calcium and sulfates. Calcium and sulfate leaching can \ngenerate empty spaces in concrete structure, and therefore affect \nadversely compression resistance in long term.\nAnalyzing the results, coal waste brings benefits to adjust the par-\nticles size of the fine aggregates and the presence of quartz as the \nmajor crystalline phase reinforces coal waste as an inert material \nwith weak potential for hydraulic activity. However, the presence \nof the amorphous phase as well as the minerals kaolinite, illite, \ngypsum, and pyrite (even at low concentrations) could affect the \n\nTable 4 \u2013 Acid generation prediction results of the raw waste, coal waste fine aggregate, \nand concrete paving blocks with 0%, 25%, and 50% of substitution of river sand \n\nby the coal waste fine aggregate\n\nParameter Raw coal waste\nCoal waste \n\nfine aggregate\nConcrete paving blocks\n\n0% substitution 25% substitution 50% substitution\n\nTotal S (%) 7.0 1.9 0.5 0.4 0.9\n\nAP (kg CaCO\n3\n/t) 218.8 60.8 15.7 12.2 27.5\n\nNP (kg CaCO\n3\n/t) 0.0 0.0 241.0 430.0 488.2\n\nNNP -218.8 - 60.8 225.3 417.8 460.7\n\nFormation of AMD Yes Yes No No No\n\nFigure 6 \u2013 pH values   of the leachate from the humidity cells containing raw waste, \ncoal waste fine aggregate, and concrete paving blocks (containing 0% and 50% \n\nof coal waste aggregate replacing natural sand)\n\n\n\n22 IBRACON Structures and Materials Journal \u2022 2015 \u2022 vol. 8  \u2022 n\u00ba 1\n\nMineral processing and characterization of coal waste to be used as fine aggregates for concrete \npaving blocks \n\nlong-term behavior of the paving blocks. The amorphous structure \ncan lead to alkali-aggregate reactivity causing expansion of the \naggregate in hardened concrete structure [30]. Illite can also cause \nexpansion and cracking of concretes in such a manner that ap-\npeared analogous to alkali-silica reactivity. Expansion by illite was \nsuggested to occur by swelling and followed by de-dolomitisation \nby the cement alkalis [49]. Gypsum presence in aggregates can \nproduce false set in freshly mixed concrete and pyrite can oxi-\ndize and release sulfates. Sulfates can react after the concrete \nhas hardened, causing expansion and cracking [30,50,51]. As \nmentioned before, the same water/cement ratio used in refer-\nence concrete could not be kept in concrete produced with coal \nwaste fine aggregate. The presence of clays in a cement mixture \nreduces the amount of water available for the hydration reactions, \ndecreases its workability, and alters the course of the pozzolanic \nreactions [52,53,54]. Problems with increased water demand with \nclay minerals including kaolinite and illite were observed in other \nworks [55,56]. These comments are in agreement with other stud-\nies about coal waste (colliery spoils) as aggregates for concrete \nproduction. Those studies highlighted excessive wear, expansive \nbehavior and pyrite oxidation as the main drawbacks for its use \nas aggregate in civil construction [7,8].  Kinnuthia et al. applied \ncolliery spoil as fine and coarse aggregates in low and medium \nstrength concretes [8].\nFinally, with a level of substitution of 25% the demand of coal waste \nfine aggregate was estimated to be 12.1 kg/m2 of paved area. Con-\nsidering a run-of-mine coal production of 40,000 t, 60% of the ma-\nterial is discharged as waste, and 50% of this fraction is separated \nbetween the relative densities of 2.4 and 2.8, it is possible to pro-\nduce about 12,000 t of fine aggregates, which is sufficient to attend \na paved area of about 1 km2.\n\n4. Conclusion\n\nThe results showed that it was possible to process the coal waste \nfrom the carboniferous region of Santa Catarina and obtain a re-\ncycled fine aggregate that can be used in civil construction.

The material, composed mainly of siltstone and sandstone, \npresented a low concentration of sulfur, about 1% of sulfate, and \na particle size distribution that met the specification for fine aggre-\ngates. Concrete blocks for paving produced with 25% and 50% of \nrecycled coal waste, substituted for river sand, presented satisfac-\ntory results in terms of compression resistance. The use of coal \nwaste as a fine aggregate for concrete block paving manufacture \npresents technical viability and environmental benefits. The de-\nmand for sand deposits can be minimized and a part of the coal \ntailings can be used, reducing the volume in coal waste deposits. \nWe believe that this procedure can be applied to minimize the en-\nvironmental problems posed by coal production in Brazil.\n\n5.
