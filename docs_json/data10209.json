Physical treatments such as heat treatments have been implicated in higher\n\nincidence of physiological disorders and enhancement of ripening processes. Therefore, the objective of the present work was\n\nto determine the effects of hot water treatments on ethylene production and on the in vitro activity of ACC oxidase. Cv. Keitt\n\nmangoes were immersed for 3 min in hot water at 53 \u00b0C or 90 min in water at 46 \u00b0C. Immediately after the treatments, some of\nthe mangoes were analyzed for ACC oxidase activity and others were stored to be analyzed after 4 days at 12 \u00b0C. There was a\nsignificant increase in the ACC oxidase activity just after the hot water treatments. After 4 days, only the mangoes treated for\n\n90 min maintained high ethylene production and ACC oxidase activity. Tissue from the outer layers of the mesocarp had higher\n\nenzyme activity compared to tissues from the innermost layers of the mesocarp of heat-treated mangoes.\n\nKey words: Ethylene, ethylene dibromide, heat treatment, Mangifera indica L.\n\nEfeito de tratamento t\u00e9rmico na atividade da ACC oxidase em mangas \u2018Keitt\u2019: Com a proibi\u00e7\u00e3o do uso de dibrometo de\n\netileno para tratamento quarenten\u00e1rio, os tratamentos t\u00e9rmicos, \u00e1gua ou vapor quente, constituem as \u00fanicas alternativas\n\ndispon\u00edveis para desinfesta\u00e7\u00e3o de mosca-das-frutas em mangas.

For mangoes, hot water dips have been approved.\n\nThese treatments allow mango shipments out of areas where\n\nfruit flies are endemic (Mitcham and McDonald, 1993b). The\n\nuse of hot water as a disinfestation treatment has spread be-\n\ncause of its efficacy and the low incidence of damage to the\n\ntreated fruit (Jacobi et al., 1995). Nevertheless, some peel\n\ndisorders as well as quality losses have been observed (Jacobi\n\nand Wong, 1991). Among those is accumulation of starch\n\ngrains in sub-epidermal tissues, probably resulting from heat\n\ndeactivation of starch hydrolases (Jacobi and Wong, 1992).\n\nNegative effects on fruit color were also reported (Joyce et\n\nal., 1993). All these effects were more pronounced on man-\n\ngoes harvested at the mature green ripeness stage than at later\n\nstages (Jacobi and Wong, 1992).\n\n\n\n146\n\nBraz. J. Plant Physiol., 15(3):145-148, 2003\n\nRENAR JO\u00c3O BENDER  et al.\n\nBesides their use as quarantine treatments, hot water dips\n\nare also effective in the control of anthracnose, a critical\n\npostharvest pathogen that can cause severe losses in mango\n\n(Coates et al., 1993). To control postharvest pathogens, the\n\nuse of higher temperatures has been recommended, though\n\nfor shorter exposure times in order to avoid damage to treated\n\nfruit.\n\nMitcham and McDonald (1993a) measured an increase\n\nin ethylene production as a response to heat stress. Increases\n\nin ethylene production might stimulate ripening processes.\n\nHowever, this stimulus could be limited because of the ef-\n\nfects of elevated temperatures on the enzymes of the ethyl-\n\nene biosynthetic pathway (Paull and Chen, 2000). Therefore\n\nthe objective of the present work was to determine the ef-\n\nfects of heat treatments on ethylene biosynthesis, and more\n\nspecifically on the in vitro activity of ACC oxidase.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nCultivar Keitt mangoes were harvested at the mature\n\ngreen ripeness stage from a grove located in Pine Island/Fort\n\nMyers, Florida. Sixteen uniform fruit, average weight of 595.9\n\n\u00b1 45.1 grams, preclimacteric, producing 0.0482 \u00b1 0.0018 \u00b5L\nC2H4 \n\n. kg-1 . h-1, were immersed in hot water for either 3 min\n\nat 53 \u00b0C or 90 min at 46 \u00b0C.\nShortly before the heat treatments, ethylene production\n\nof each fruit was determined. One-mL headspace samples\n\nwere retrieved from 1.7 L glass jars and injected in a photo-\n\nionization gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a 60/80\n\nmesh 760 x 3.16 mm activated alumina column. The GC de-\n\ntector and injector were operated at room temperature. The\n\ncolumn temperature was slightly above ambient because of\n\nheating by the UV source.\n\nAfter the heat treatments the mangoes were left for 30\n\nmin at room temperature and then ethylene production of each\n\nindividual fruit was again determined. The mangoes from each\n\nheat treatment were divided into two groups. One group of\n\neight fruit was transferred to a cold store to be analyzed after\n\n4 days at 12 \u00b0C. The other eight fruit were immediately ana-\nlyzed for the in vitro activity of ACC oxidase. Tissues from\n\nthree depths of the mesocarp, 5 mm underneath the epider-\n\nmis, the median portion of the mesocarp, and from tissues\n\nclose to the seed, were used to determine enzyme activity.\n\nACC oxidase activity was determined according to\n\nFernandez-Maculet and Yang (1992) with modifications. In-\n\nstead of TRIS (Tris[hydroximethyl]aminomethane), 0.4\n\nmol.L-1 3-(N-morpholino)propane sulfonic acid (MOPS) was\n\nused in the extraction buffer. To the assay buffer in a test tube\n\nwere added 1.64 mL of 50 mmol.L-1 MOPS (pH 7.2), 10 %\n\nglycerol (v/v), 20 mmol.L-1 sodium bicarbonate and 0.2 mL\n\nof the crude extract of ACC oxidase. Prior to 1 h of incuba-\n\ntion in the test tube at 30 \u00b0C, 40 \u00b5L of a mixture containing\n250 mmol.L-1 sodium ascorbate, 1 mmol.L-1 FeSO4.7H2O,\n\n50 mmol.L-1 dithiothreitol (DTT), and 50 mmol.L-1 ACC was\n\nadded to the assay.\n\nAfter the 4 days of storage at 12 \u00b0C, ethylene production\nand ACC oxidase activity were determined as described above\n\nfrom tissue samples of three depths of the mesocarp.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe in vitro activity of ACC oxidase just after the heat\n\ntreatment was significantly higher in mangoes treated for 3\n\nmin in hot water at 53 \u00b0C compared to the 90 min treatment\nat 46 \u00b0C (table 1). After 4 more days of storage at 12 \u00b0C, no\ndifferences were determined in enzyme activity with regards\n\nto water temperatures. However, comparing analysis periods\n\nof enzyme activity, just after the treatment and after the stor-\n\nage period, for either 3 or 90 min hot water dips, there was a\n\nsignificantly higher ACC oxidase activity just after the heat\n\ntreatment in mangoes treated for 3 min at 53 \u00b0C. A longer\nexposure time at a lower temperature did not result in in-\n\ncreased enzyme activity.\n\nTable 1. In vitro ACC oxidase activity in mesocarp tissues of\n\n\u2018Keitt\u2019 mangoes after heat treatments and after 4 days of\n\nstorage at 12 \u00b0C.\n\nAnalysis perioda\n\nJust after After 4 days\n treatment of cold storage\n\nACC oxidase activity (nLC2H4 \n.  g-1 . h-1)\n\n3 min at 53 \u00b0C 0.708 a  A 0.433 a  B\n90 min at 46 \u00b0C 0.445  b A 0.335 a A\n\naValues followed by the same capital letter in the rows and small letter in\nthe columns do not differ significantly at p&lt;0.05 (Tukey\u2019s test).\n\nThese increases in enzyme activity are probably a result\n\nof the heat stress caused by the hot water treatments. Chan et\n\nal. (1998) observed the same stimulus to ACC oxidase activ-\n\nity in papaya treated in hot water.\n\nAntunes and Sfakiotakis (2000) working with kiwis con-\n\ncluded that there is a pronounced inhibitory effect of heat on\n\nethylene biosynthesis. Storage treatments of 38 \u00b0C or 40 \u00b0C\ncompletely suppressed ethylene production. The authors also\n\nHeat\ntreatments\n\n\n\nHEAT TREATMENT AND ACC OXIDASE IN MANGOES\n\nBraz. J. Plant Physiol., 15(3):145-148, 2003\n\n147\n\nconcluded that ACC oxidase is more susceptible to elevated\n\ntemperatures compared to ACC synthase.\n\nThese differences in ACC oxidase activity of cv. Keitt\n\nmangoes did not result in significant increases in ethylene\n\nproduction following the hot water dips (figure 1). However,\n\nmangoes immersed in 53 \u00b0C water for only 3 min produced\nan average of 0.06 \u00b5L C2H4 \n\n. kg-1 . h-1 more ethylene than\n\nmangoes treated for 90 min at 46 \u00b0C, which might be attrib-\nutable to slight increments in enzyme activity, though not\n\nstatistically different.\n\nOn the contrary, mangoes immersed for 90 min in hot\n\nwater at 46 \u00b0C had after 4 days at 12 \u00b0C a significant peak of\nethylene production, above 0.2 \u00b5L kg-1. h-1, which might be\nconsidered part of the climacteric peak. It might be further-\n\nmore considered that the climacteric peak was initiated by\n\nthe heat treatment. Bender (1996) concluded that the climac-\n\nteric peak of mangoes lasts at least 5 days with maximum\n\nethylene production rates over 1 \u00b5L C2H4 \n. kg -1. h-1.\n\nKetsa et al. (1999) though determined a 5-day delay in\n\nthe upsurge of the climacteric peak in heat-treated cv. Nam\n\nDormai mangoes. Verlinden and Woodson (1998) also re-\n\nported a 24-hour delay in the ethylene peak of carnations\n\ntreated for 1 day at 44 \u00b0C.\nThese differences in the start of the climacteric peak might\n\nbe related to the duration of the heat treatment. Ketsa et al.\n\n(1999) applied hot air at 38 \u00b0C for 3 days, while in the present\nexperiment the longest treatment period was of 90 min. Most\n\nprobably treatment duration is an important factor to con-\n\nsider in the indication if there are or are not effects on ripen-\n\ning processes of mangoes.\n\nAnalyzing the differences in the in vitro activity of ACC\n\noxidase extracted from different depths of the mango meso-\n\ncarp treated with hot water for 3 or 90 min, higher enzyme\n\nactivity was observed only just after the 3 min treatment and\n\nonly in the outermost layers of the mesocarp (table 2). In the\n\nremainder of the tissues no stimuli to ACC oxidase activity\n\nwere observed.\n\nMcCollum et al. (1995) observed the same differences\n\nin enzyme activity and ethylene production in heat-treated\n\ncucumbers. The authors suggested the possibility of a more\n\ncomplex control mechanism that goes beyond the regulation\n\nof the enzymes of the ethylene pathway, specifically ACC\n\noxidase. However, the authors did not indicate which mecha-\n\nnism or mechanisms could be involved in such regulation.\n\nOn the other hand, Ievinsh et al. (2001) observed that distinct\n\nabiotic stimuli for increases in ACC oxidase activity were\n\nfollowed with synchronous increases in ethylene production\n\nof Pinus sylvestris needles. This conclusion diverges from\n\nour observations with \u201cKeitt\u201d mangoes. Most probably the\n\nclimacteric ripening pattern of the mangoes and cucumbers\n\nin contrast to pine needles is responsible for these differences.\n\nAfter storage for 4 days at 12 \u00b0C, ethylene production was\nhigher in mangoes from the 90 min hot water treatment com-\n\npared to mangoes dipped in hot water for only 3 min. Man-\n\ngoes from the latter treatment did not exhibit significantly\n\naltered ripening processes. After 4 days at 12 \u00b0C, they still\nwere preclimacteric. Ethylene production was below 0.2 \u00b5L\nC2H4 \n\n. kg-1. h-1, a concentration indicated by Bender and Brecht\n\n(2000) as the beginning of the climacteric rise in ethylene\n\nproduction of cv. Tommy Atkins and cv. Kent mangoes.\n\nFigure 1.

Yet there is a tendency for a slight increase in en-\n\nzyme activity determined in tissues from the median portion\n\nof the mesocarp, comparing 0.365 nL C2H4 \n.  g-1 . h-1 to 0.600\n\nnL C2H4 \n.  g-1 . h-1 in table 2.\n\nWith  the  more  prolonged  heat  treatment,  90 min at\n\n46 \u00b0C, no increases in enzyme activity were determined.\nReduced enzyme activity, nonetheless could be an indication\n\nof a more remarkable and lasting effect of the hot water dip\n\non ACC oxidase. Most likely a lasting effect of the prolonged\n\nheat treatment was the cause of the reduced ACC oxidase\n\nactivity in agreement with the observations of Jacobi and\n\nWong (1992) regarding starch hydrolysis of heat-treated\n\nmangoes.\n\nIn interpreting the effects of the hot water dips on the in\n\nvitro activity of ACC oxidase determined immediately after\n\ntreatment application, we need to consider that mangoes ini-\n\ntiate ripening processes in the innermost layers of the meso-\n\ncarp (Mitcham and McDonald, 1993a). This behavior be-\n\ncomes evident in examining enzyme activity before treatments\n\n(0.667 nL C2H4\n. g-1. h-1) to the activity of tissues close to the\n\nseed after the heat treatment and after 4 days at 12 \u00b0C. In\nboth analyses there is an indication of lower enzyme activity,\n\npossibly a consequence of the increased temperatures at the\n\ncore of the mangoes as is required for quarantine treatment\n\n(Sharp, 1986).\n\nThe significant increase in the in vitro activity of ACC\n\noxidase of cv. Keitt mangoes immersed for 3 min in hot wa-\n\nter at 53 \u00b0C and the return to initial levels of activity after 4\ndays at 12 \u00b0C indicates that the effect of short exposure to\nheat only has a temporary effect on ethylene biosynthesis.\n\nHigher rates of ethylene production during storage at 12 \u00b0C\nof mangoes treated for 90 min with hot water at 46 \u00b0C prob-\nably derives from enhanced ACC oxidase activity of epider-\n\nmal tissues since the innermost tissues there is no increment\n\nin enzyme activity.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAntunes MDC, Sfakiotakis EM (2000) Effect of high tem-\nperature stress on ethylene biosynthesis, respiration and\nripening of \u2018Hayward\u2019 kiwifruit.
