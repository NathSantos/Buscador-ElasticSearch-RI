Segundo Chakhmouradian and Mitchell (2000), CaTiO3-perovskitas podem ser usadas para revelar as condi\u00e7\u00f5es de alguns dos m\u00faltiplos est\u00e1gios de cristaliza\u00e7\u00e3o da hist\u00f3ria magm\u00e1tica destas rochas. No intuito de estabelecer a fugacidade de oxig\u00eanio de magmas kimberl\u00edticos naturais, CaTiO3-perovskitas foram cristalizadas experimentalmente em equil\u00edbrio com um l\u00edquido kimberl\u00edtico sint\u00e9tico em altas temperaturas e diferentes condi\u00e7\u00f5es de press\u00e3o e de fugacidade de oxig\u00eanio. Os experimentos mostraram que a perovskita incorporou maiores quantidades de Fe com o aumento da fO2. A equa\u00e7\u00e3o do oxig\u00eanio bar\u00f4metro desenvolvida neste estudo pode ser aplicada em rochas kimberl\u00edticas de diferentes condi\u00e7\u00f5es de fO2, que cont\u00eam CaTiO3-perovskita e olivina. Na presente pesquisa, n\u00f3s aplicamos este oxig\u00eanio bar\u00f4metro em amostras do kimberlito Ros\u00e1rio do Sul, que \u00e9 um kimberlito transicional localizado no limite sudoeste da Bacia do Paran\u00e1. Os dados de minerais deste kimberlito sugerem que sua fonte \u00e9 um produto da rea\u00e7\u00e3o de um l\u00edquido silic\u00e1tico-carbonat\u00edtico com o manto. Idades U-Pb de ~ 128Ma em CaTiO3-perovskitas (Concei\u00e7\u00e3o et al., inprep.) revelam que o kimberlito Ros\u00e1rio do Sul provavelmente entrou em erup\u00e7\u00e3o logo ap\u00f3s o vulcanismo da Prov\u00edncia Paran\u00e1-Etendeka. Temperaturas de cristaliza\u00e7\u00e3o, press\u00f5es e fO2 dos kimberlitos Ros\u00e1rio do Sul e Alfeu-I, outro importante kimberlito situado no sul do Brasil, foram calculadas. As condi\u00e7\u00f5es de suas fontes foram estimadas usando diferentes m\u00e9todos a partir das composi\u00e7\u00f5es de olivinas, espin\u00e9lios, CaTiO3-perovskitas, granadas, ortopirox\u00eanios e clinopirox\u00eanios. As temperaturas, press\u00f5es e condi\u00e7\u00f5es defO2 dos kimberlitos Ros\u00e1rio do Sul e Alfeu-I sugerem que eles foram transportados para a superf\u00edcie em condi\u00e7\u00f5es nas quais fluidos ricos em CO2 podem reagir com o manto silic\u00e1tico e produzir carbonatos. A composi\u00e7\u00e3o mineral e as condi\u00e7\u00f5es de forma\u00e7\u00e3o do kimberlito Ros\u00e1rio do Sul indicam que a sua fonte pode ter sido metassomatizada por fluidos provenientes da reciclagem de uma placa oce\u00e2nica subductada durante a quebra do Gondwana e abertura do Atl\u00e2ntico Sul, logo depois do vulcanismo da Prov\u00edncia Paran\u00e1-Etendeka. As condi\u00e7\u00f5es de forma\u00e7\u00e3o dos kimberlitos Ros\u00e1rio do Sul e Alfeu-I s\u00e3o usadas tamb\u00e9m para estimar o potencial destes kimberlitos em preservar diamantes.\nABSTRACT\nKimberlites are volcanic rocks which often contain diamonds, graphite and/or carbonate, and the stability of these minerals is directly influenced by the variability of oxygen fugacity (fO2) of the magma during its ascent. Second Chakhmouradian and Mitchell (2000), CaTiO3-perovskites may be used to unravel the conditions of some of the multiple stages of crystallization in the magmatic history of these rocks. In order to establish oxygen fugacities of natural kimberlititic magmas, we experimentally equilibrated CaTiO3-perovskites with synthetic kimberlitic melts at high temperatures, different oxygen fugacities and different pressures. The experiments show that perovskite incorporates increasing amounts of Fe3+ with increasing fO2. The oxygen barometer equation developed in this study can be applied in kimberlite rocks that contain CaTiO3-perovskite and olivine from different fO2 conditions. In the present research, we applied this oxygen barometer in the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite samples, which is a transitional kimberlite located in the southwestern edge of the Paran\u00e1 Basin. The mineral data of this kimberlite suggest that its source is a product of the reaction of a silicate-carbonate liquid in the mantle. U-Pb ages of ~ 128 Ma on CaTiO3-perovskites (Concei\u00e7\u00e3o et al., in prep.) reveal that the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite probably erupted just after the volcanism of Paran\u00e1-Etendeka Province. We calculated crystallization temperatures, pressures and oxygen fugacities (fO2) of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul and Alfeu-I kimberlites, another important kimberlite situated in the South of Brazil. Their source conditions are estimated using different methods from olivines, spinels, CaTiO3-perovskites, garnets, orthopyroxenes and clinopyroxenes compositions. The calculated temperature, pressure and fO2 values of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul and Alfeu-I kimberlites suggest that they were transported to the surface under fO2 conditions in which CO2-rich fluids may react with mantle silicates to produce carbonates. The mineral composition and fO2 conditions of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite indicate that its source may have been metasomatized by fluids generated from the recycling of a subducted oceanic plate during the Gondwana breakup and the South Atlantic opening, just after the Paran\u00e1-Etendeka Province volcanism. The source conditions of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul and Alfeu-I kimberlites are also used to estimate the potential of these kimberlites to preserve diamonds.\nSUM\u00c1RIO\nESTRUTURA DA TESE......................................................8\n1.\tINTRODU\u00c7\u00c3O .........................................................9\n1.1\tKimberlitos Ros\u00e1rio do Sul e Alfeu-1..............................9\n1.2\tFugacidade de oxig\u00eanio, comportamento do ferro e estrutura da CaTiO3-\nperovskita............................................................11\n1.3\tObjetivos da pesquisa............................................15\n2.\tPETROLOGIA EXPERIMENTAL............................................16\n3.\tAN\u00c1LISE INTEGRADORA DOS MANUSCRITOS SUBMETIDOS.....................20\n3.1\tManuscrito: \u201cThe effects of redox conditions on ferric iron in CaTiO3-perovskite\nfrom kimberlitic magmas\u201d..............................................20\n3.2\tManuscrito: \u201cHeterogeneity in the South Brazilian Mantle evidenced by the major and\ntrace element compositions of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite minerals\u201d.....46\n3.3\tManuscrito: \u201cOrigin and redox conditions of the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul and Alfeu-I\nkimberlites, Southern Brazil: implications for diamond preservation\u201d.109\nREFER\u00caNCIAS BIBLIOGR\u00c1FICAS DA TESE...................................150\nESTRUTURA DA TESE\nEsta tese de Doutorado est\u00e1 estruturada em torno de artigos publicados em peri\u00f3dicos ou publica\u00e7\u00f5es equivalentes.

INTRODU\u00c7\u00c3O\nKimberlitos s\u00e3o rochas subsaturadas em s\u00edlica (de 30 a 40 peso% SiO2), que cont\u00eam abundante quantidade de CO2 e \u00e1gua, bem como altas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de elementos incompat\u00edveis (Mitchell, 1986). Segundo muitos pesquisadores (e.g., Wedephohl e Muramatsu, 1979), s\u00e3o rochas formadas a partir de baixo grau de fus\u00e3o parcial de peridotitos do manto superior, em profundidades de cerca de 100km (equivalentes a aproximadamente 3GPa de press\u00e3o), e que geralmente ascendem para a superf\u00edcie em alta velocidade (e.g. Bailey, 1993).\nNo Brasil, as principais ocorr\u00eancias kimberl\u00edticas s\u00e3o encontradas nas regi\u00f5es central e noroeste como, por exemplo, os corpos kimberl\u00edticos da \u00e1rea de Ju\u00edna, no estado do Mato Grosso do Sul (Kaminsky, et al., 2009). No entanto, estudos recentes apontam para um magmatismo kimberl\u00edtico na regi\u00e3o sul do pa\u00eds (Concei\u00e7\u00e3o et al., in prep.; Chaves et al., 2014; Adri\u00e3o, 2015; Provenzano, 2016; Concei\u00e7\u00e3o et al., in prep.), com a presen\u00e7a de kimberlitos como o Ros\u00e1rio do Sul e o Alfeu-I, estudados na presente tese.\nO kimberlito Ros\u00e1rio do Sul, que \u00e9 um kimberlito transicional (Concei\u00e7\u00e3o et al., in prep.) pertencente \u00e0 Prov\u00edncia Kimberl\u00edtica de Ros\u00e1rio do Sul, ocorre encaixado em arenitos Faneroz\u00f3icos da Forma\u00e7\u00e3o Piramb\u00f3ia e est\u00e1 localizado na por\u00e7\u00e3o sudeste da bacia do Paran\u00e1, na regi\u00e3o sul do Brasil (Adri\u00e3o, 2015 e Edler et al., 1998) (Fig. 1). Idades U-Pb de aproximadamente 128Ma, feitas em CaTiO3-perovskitas (Concei\u00e7\u00e3o et al., in prep.), indicam que este kimberlito entrou em erup\u00e7\u00e3o logo ap\u00f3s o vulcanismo da Prov\u00edncia Paran\u00e1-Etendeka, ocorrido a aproximadamente 132Ma, o que sugere que a fonte de calor respons\u00e1vel pela ascens\u00e3o deste kimberlito poderia estar relacionada ao processo que desencadeou o magmatismo Paran\u00e1-Etendeka em um ambiente extensional. Esta hip\u00f3tese indica a presen\u00e7a de uma heterogeneidade mant\u00e9lica na fonte dos basaltos continentais da Bacia do Paran\u00e1 devido \u00e0 percola\u00e7\u00e3o de l\u00edquidos carbonat\u00edticos.\nOutros eventos alcalinos ocorrem na borda da Prov\u00edncia Paran\u00e1-Etendeka, como o complexo de Lages, de idade pr\u00f3xima a 70-77Ma (Gibson et al., 1999), e o Complexo Arax\u00e1, com 89Ma (e.g. Hasui e Cordani, 1968), que incluem carbonatitos e lampr\u00f3firos do Cret\u00e1ceo Superior (de 60 a 90Ma).

Segundo Provenzano (2016), ainda que dados de petrograf\u00eda e mineralogia do kimberlito Alfeu-I sejam compat\u00edveis aos kimberlitos do Grupo II, dados de qu\u00edmica mineral indicam caracter\u00edsticas transicionais entre\nkimberlitos do Grupo I e II e lampro\u00edtos, indicando que a petrog\u00eanese do kimberlito Alfeu-I \u00e9 similar a outros magmas pot\u00e1ssicos sem uma forte afinidade com um grupo em particular.\n-53\u00b0\n-52\u00b030'\n\u25a1\nO\nCpx Granito-Gn\u00e1issico Pinheiro Machado metagranit\u00f3ides porfir\u00edticos\nSuite Gran\u00edtica Dom Feliciano\nLitof\u00e1cies Serra do Erval\nSu\u00edte Gran\u00edtica Dom Feliciano\nLitof\u00e1cies Cerro Grande\nGranito Passo da Mozinha\nGranito Arroio Moinho\nGabro Passo da Fabiana\nCpx Metam\u00f3rfico Porongos quartzitos\nForma\u00e7\u00e3o Sanga do Cabral\nGranito Cap\u00e3o do Le\u00e3o\nCpx Granito-Gn\u00e1issico Pinheiro Machado gnaisses granodior\u00edticos\nDep\u00f3sitos de plan\u00edcie lagunar\nFig. 2: Mapa geol\u00f3gico com a localiza\u00e7\u00e3o do kimberlito Alfeu-I (fonte: Mapa geol\u00f3gico do\nEstado do Rio Grande do Sul, Escala 1:750.000- CPRM).\n1.2\tFugacidade de oxig\u00eanio, comportamento do ferro e estrutura da CaTiO3-perovskita\nUma s\u00e9rie de vari\u00e1veis s\u00e3o respons\u00e1veis pelas caracter\u00edsticas da assembl\u00e9ia mineral em uma rocha kimberl\u00edtica, como: composi\u00e7\u00e3o do l\u00edquido, press\u00e3o, temperatura e fugacidade de oxig\u00eanio (/O2). Desempenhando um importante papel na determina\u00e7\u00e3o da composi\u00e7\u00e3o de qualquer fase fluida associada a rochas \u00edgneas e metam\u00f3rficas, a fugacidade de oxig\u00eanio \u00e9 medida em unidade de press\u00e3o e definida como atividade qu\u00edmica do oxig\u00eanio (Clark, 1999). A fO2 diminui no manto com o aumento da press\u00e3o, variando de valores pr\u00f3ximos do\nFig. 3: Diagrama de compara\u00e7\u00e3o \u00cdog/O2 versus temperatura, a 1.8 e 6 GPa de press\u00e3o, dos seguintes tamp\u00f5es (buffersy.

Isto pode ser exp\u00cdicado devido a mudan\u00e7as na fO2. Estes \u00cd\u00edquidos comumente fracionam o\u00cdivina e possive\u00cdmente pirox\u00eanio durante sua ascen\u00e7\u00e3o, diminuindo a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de Fe no \u00cd\u00edquido, que entra na estrutura destes si\u00cdicatos, e promovendo re\u00cdativa oxida\u00e7\u00e3o durante a segrega\u00e7\u00e3o do \u00cd\u00edquido e sua ascen\u00e7\u00e3o at\u00e9 a superf\u00edcie (Ba\u00cd\u00cdhaus, 1993).\nSegundo Kress e Carmichae\u00cd (1988), a fO2 governa a rea\u00e7\u00e3o de oxida\u00e7\u00e3o do ferro em 3+\n\u00cd\u00edquidos si\u00cdic\u00e1ticos. No entanto, o particionamento do ferro entre ferro f\u00e9rrico (Fe ) e ferro ferroso (Fe ) \u00e9 influenciada tamb\u00e9m por outros fatores, como a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1\u00cdca\u00cdis (Carmichae\u00cd e Nicho\u00cd\u00cds, 1967). Rochas a\u00cdca\u00cdinas como kimber\u00cditos tendem a apresentar a\u00cdto teor de Fe3+, como confirmado por Fuda\u00cdi (1965).\nA fO2 aumenta com o aumento da temperatura devido \u00e0 abund\u00e2ncia de oxig\u00eanio \u00cdivre no fluido, que ocorre atrav\u00e9s da dissocia\u00e7\u00e3o de mo\u00cd\u00e9cu\u00cdas como H2O, CO2 ou SO2, da rea\u00e7\u00e3o de transforma\u00e7\u00e3o do N2 em NH3 em f\u00cduidos aquosos, da precipita\u00e7\u00e3o do grafite ou da redu\u00e7\u00e3o do ferro f\u00e9rrico (Frost, 1991). A\u00cd\u00e9m disso, em profundidades de cerca de 140 a 175 km, fluidos podem mudar de dominantemente reduzidos (H2O-CH4) para dominantemente oxidados (H2O-CO2) devido a mudan\u00e7as nas condi\u00e7\u00f5es de fO2 do manto sob estas profundidades (Zhang e Duan, 2009). A preserva\u00e7\u00e3o de diamantes em rochas kimber\u00cd\u00edticas depende das condi\u00e7\u00f5es de fugacidade de oxig\u00eanio do manto e do \u00cd\u00edquido kimber\u00cd\u00edtico. O estado de oxirredu\u00e7\u00e3o do manto determina se o carbono est\u00e1 presente como forma oxidada (CO2, carbonato ou \u00cd\u00edquido carbonat\u00edtico), ou como forma reduzida (grafite, diamante ou metano) (Rohrbach e Schmidt, 2011). Sendo assim, em condi\u00e7\u00f5es de baixa fO2, diamantes t\u00eam uma maior possibi\u00cdidade de serem preservados em re\u00cda\u00e7\u00e3o a condi\u00e7\u00f5es de a\u00cdta fO2, quando os diamantes podem ser mais faci\u00cdmente reabsorvidos ou mesmo desaparecer (Be\u00cd\u00cdis e Cani\u00cd, 2007).\nCaTi\u00dc3-perovskita \u00e9 uma fase acess\u00f3ria muito comum em rochas \u00edgneas com baixo teor de Si\u00dc2 e altos teores de \u00e1lcalis, C\u00dc2 e H2\u00dc.

It is well known that kimberlites experience multiple stages of crystallization under changing conditions during ascent, and it has been suggested that natural perovskites may be used to unravel parts of the magmatic history of these rocks (Chakhmouradian and Mitchell 2000). In order to establish oxygen fugacities of natural kimberlititic magmas, we experimentally equilibrated perovskites with synthetic kimberlitic melts at high temperatures, different oxygen fugacities and different pressures. The experiments show that perovskite incorporates increasing amounts of Fe with increasing fO2. Given that olivine only incorporates Fe , and perovskite only incorporates Fe , it is possible to calculate an Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio of the kimberlitic melt from Fe in perovskite and Fe in olivine electron microprobe measurements. The results indicate that the Fe-concentration in perovskite and in the melt of a kimberlite critically depends on fO2. The oxygen barometer equation developed in this study can be applied in kimberlite rocks that contain perovskite and olivine from different fO2 conditions.\nKeywords: kimberlite; oxygen fugacity; perovskite; olivine; ferric iron\nHighlights:\n\u2022\tSince kimberlites experience multiple stages of crystallization under changing conditions during ascent, the Fe content and modes of perovskites and olivines are used as an important tool to estimate the redox conditions of these rocks.\n\u2022\tGiven that olivine only incorporates Fe2+, and perovskite only incorporates Fe3+, it is possible to calculate an Fe /Fe ratio of the kimberlitic melt.\n\u2022\tThe results indicate that the Fe-concentration in perovskite and in the melt of a kimberlite critically depends on fO2.\n\u2022\tThe oxygen barometer equation developed in this study can be applied in kimberlite rocks that contain perovskite and olivine from different fO2 conditions.\n1. Introduction\nOxygen fugacity (fO2) is one of the variables, together with melt composition, pressure and temperature that governs the mineral assemblages in the rock, and plays an important role in determining the composition of any fluid phase associated with igneous and metamorphic rocks. Although the upper mantle is affected by metasomatism, partial melting, and recycling of oxidized material by subduction (Frost and McCammon, 2008), it is still the most intriguing part of the Earth to measure the oxygen fugacity. With increasing pressure, fO2 decreases in the mantle, and in deeper regions, below ~ 250km depth, fO2 can only vary from values around the IW (iron-wustite) buffer (Rohrbach and Schmidt, 2011).\nThe oxygen fugacity also indicates whether iron is present in its native state or as a divalent or trivalent ion, if it is included in a silicate or in an oxide (Frost, 1991). According to Kress and Carmichael (1988), the iron oxidation reaction in silicate melts is commonly expressed in terms of the reaction:\n2FeO (melt) +I/2O2 (gas) = Fe2O3 (melt)\nThe buffering capacity of mantle material depends on the total iron content and the oxidation state of iron (Arculus, 1985; Ballhaus, 1993). In natural liquids, the partitioning of iron between ferric iron (Fe3+) and ferrous iron (Fe2+) is influenced by different factors. One of them is alkali concentration (Carmichael and Nicholls, 1967). Alkaline rocks as kimberlites tend to present high ferric iron content, as studied by Fudali (1965), who confirmed that alkalis tend to increase the ferric iron content of the melt.\nThe oxygen fugacity of all buffers increases with increasing temperature due to the increasing devolatilization of oxygen. The sources of oxygen are the result of H2O, CO2, or SO2 dissociation, the reaction of N2 into NH3 in aqueous fluids, the precipitation of graphite or the reduction of ferric iron (Frost, 1991), beyond the free oxygen in the fluid. Furthermore, around 140 to 175 km depth, fluids can change from dominantly reduced (H2O-CH4) to dominantly oxidized (H2O-CO2) due to the changes in the fO2 conditions of the mantle under these depths (Zhang and Duan, 2009).\nMelts like kimberlites, derived from partial melting of the mantle, could be reducing in the deep mantle but become more oxidized than crystalline mantle counterpart during ascent or before the eruption. This can be explained due to a change in fO2 buffering mechanism. Melts are likely to fractionate some olivine and possibly pyroxene during ascent (i.e. loose components with a bulk Fe /ZFe ratio lower than that of the melt), and this process will promote relative oxidation when the melt segregates and rises to the surface (Ballhaus, 1993). The diamond preservation in kimberlite rocks depends on the oxygen fugacity conditions of the mantle and the kimberlitic melts. The redox state of the mantle determines if carbon is present as CO2, carbonate or carbonatite melt (oxidized form), or as graphite, diamond or methane (reduced form) (Rohrbach and Schmidt, 2011). Therefore, in\nconditions with low fO2, diamonds can be preserved. However, in conditions with high fO2, diamonds can be reabsorbed or even disappear.\nCaTiO3-perovskite is an accessory phase very common in low SiO2 igneous rocks. As kimberlites are low SiO2 and high alkalis, CO2 and H2O rocks, CaTiO3-perovskite is easily found in their groundmass. According to Canil and Bellis (2007), perovskites from kimberlites can record if the oxygen fugacity conditions of this rock are extremely high (i.e. an oxidized mantle source) or very low (i.e. a mechanism involving buffering by carbon-fluid equilibria or a very reduced mantle source).\n2_|_\nIn the CaTiO3-perovskite structure, the dodecahedral site is occupied by Ca and the octahedral site is occupied by Ti4+ or Fe3+. The iron incorporated in the octahedral site is mainly ferric iron (Fe ) (Muir et al., 1984; Mitchel et al., 1998) because olivine crystallizes first and incorporates most of the Fe2+, leaving behind Fe3+ in the liquid for the perovskites. Therefore, the Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio in the system can be calculated measuring Fe in perovskite (as Fe3+) (McCammon et al., 2004) and in olivine (as Fe2+). Bellis and Canil (2007) found a positive correlation between fO2 and the Fe2O3 content of perovskites, implying that with increasing fO2, more Fe exists in the liquid as Fe3+, partitioning easily into perovskite. They also found less variability in the Fe2O3 content of perovskite at conditions below of ANNO = -3.5, because at this fO2 there is probably very little Fe available in the liquid. Since Bellis and Canil (2007) developed their experiments at 1 atm pressure, the aim of this study is the development of a tool to reconstruct the redox conditions (fO2) of a kimberlitic magma at high pressures: 1.8 GPa (around 65 km depth) and 6 GPa (around 210 km depth); considering the modal proportions of olivine and perovskite in the runs. This conditions are consistent with depth of kimberlites occurrences, since Ca(Ti,Si)O3 inclusions have been recorded in very deep diamonds from kimberlites (i.e. Juina kimberlite) (Kaminski, et.al,\n2.\tExperimental methods\n2.1.\tStarting material and experiments\nThree different synthetic kimberlitic compositions (Table 1) were produced from reagent grade oxides (SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3), hydroxides (Mg(OH)2) and carbonates (CaCO3, K2CO3), which were homogenized under acetone in an agate mortar. Compositions were subsequently dehydrated and decarbonated in a Pt crucible by stepwise heating to 1000\u00b0C. FeO was added to the mixtures after the decarbonation to avoid iron oxidation. In the LCM-10 synthetic kimberlitic composition, H2O (from Mg(OH)2) and CO2 (from CaCO3) were also added to the mixture after decarbonation. The starting compositions are similar to the compositions used by Bellis and Canil (2007) to facilitate comparison. To promote the crystallization of CaTiO3 perovskite, TiO2 and CaO were added to the synthetic kimberlitic composition LCM-5. LCM-7 is a composition more similar to a natural kimberlite, and LCM-10 is similar to LCM-5 but with additional TiO2, CaO and also 3wt.% of H2O and 4 wt.% of CO2 to investigate whether volatiles have a significant influence on perovskite stability and composition. All starting material compositions are given in Table 1.\nStart. material\tSiO2\tTiO2\tAl2O3\tFeO*\tCaO\tMgO\tK2O\tH2O\tCO2\nLCM-5\t29.6\t23.7\t2.95\t11.83\t17.7\t11.83\t2.37\t-\t-\nLCM-7\t34.2\t7.8\t0.3\t13.4\t22.2\t21.3\t-\t-\t-\nLCM-10\t25\t25\t2\t5\t24\t10\t2\t3\t4\nTable 1: Starting compositions (wt.%) used in the experiments. *all Fe added as FeO.\nWe carried out experiments at different pressures (1 atm, 1.8 GPa, 6 GPa), temperatures (1250-1350\u00b0C), and different oxygen fugacities using a gas mixing in the 1 atm experiments, and solid buffer such as Re-ReO2 and C-CO in high pressure experiments.\nThe experiments were performed at the Institut f\u00fcr Mineralogie, Universitat M\u00fcnster. Table 2 summarizes the run conditions and the resulting phases. The experiments at atmospheric pressure were performed in a conventional vertical gas-mixing furnace. The samples were mounted on Pt loops, which were suspended in the hot zone of the vertical furnace (Gero GmbH, Germany). For oxidizing conditions, the experiment was run in air (ANNO = +6.3, fO2 relative to the nickel-nickel oxide (NNO) buffer; Frost, 1991), and more reducing conditions, (ANNO = -2.09; Frost, 1991), were achieved by mixing CO and CO2 in appropriate ratios (Deines, 1974).

Phases: olivine (ol), perovskite (pv), clinopyroxene (cpx), spinel (sp), rutile (rut), titanite (tit).\nThe experiments at 1.8 and 6 GPa, under oxidizing conditions were carried out using Pt capsules lined with a Re foil (3 mm long). The Re foil has the purpose to avoid Fe loss in the runs and to constrain fO2 at the Re-ReO2 buffer (Campbell et al., 2009). The experiments at\n1.8\tand 6 GPa under reducing conditions at the C-CO buffer (Ulmer and Luth, 1991) were performed using Pt capsules lined with an inner graphite capsule. The experiments at 1.8 GPa were conducted in an end-loaded piston cylinder apparatus (Prowatke and Klemme, 2006). The 1/2 inch piston cylinder assemblies consisted of a graphite heater surrounded by\npyrexglass and talc sleeves. This assembly has been pressure calibrated using the fayalite = quartz + ferrosilite (Bohlen et al., 1980), and picrochromite + quartz = enstatite + eskolaite reactions (Klemme and O\u2019Neill, 1997; Klemme and O\u2019Neill, 2000). Experiments were conducted using the \u201cpiston-in\u201d routine (Klemme, 2010): first, a pressure of about 0.5 GPa was applied; then the sample was heated up to about 400\u00b0C to soften the glass; at last, pressure and temperature were raised stepwise and simultaneously. Pressure was kept constant (\u00b10.05 GPa) manually during the experiments using a hydraulic system. Temperatures were measured with W95Re5-W74Re26 thermocouples inserted axially into the assembly using four-bore high-purity Al2O3 tubing. The sample was placed in the hotspot of the assembly; temperature uncertainties throughout the capsule length were calibrated to be less than 20\u00b0C. The experiments were run for durations of 24 hours to ensure equilibrium of crystalline phases and coexisting melts.\nExperiments at 6 GPa were carried out in a 1000-ton Walker-type multi-anvil apparatus, using 25.4 mm tungsten carbide (WC) cubes, a 18/12 assembly (18 mm edge length cast Aremco CeramacastTM octahedra with a truncation edge length of 12 mm). The 18/12 assembly was calibrated using the phase transitions of Bi-metal (room temperature) as well as the quartz-coesite and CaGeO3 garnet to perovskite phase transitions at 1100\u00b0C. The assembly consisted of a straight graphite furnace, a ZrO2 thermal insulation sleeve, MgO spacers, and molybdenum metal plugs to ensure electrical contact between assembly and WC cubes. Temperature was measured with W95Re5-W75Re25 thermocouples. Pressure and temperature were kept constant during the run using Eurotherm controllers. The total temperature uncertainty resulting from minor temperature fluctuations during the run and temperature gradients in the assembly is estimated to be \u00b115\u00b0C.\n3.\tAnalytical methods\nExperimental run products were mounted in epoxy resin, polished with non-hydrous diamond-based polishing pastes, and checked using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM - JEOL JSM 6610LV).\nThe experimental run products were subsequently analyzed for major and minor elements using a JEOL JXA 8900 and JEOL JXA 8530F electron microprobes at the Institut fur Mineralogie, Munster. Analyses were performed using an accelerating voltage of 15 kV and a beam current of 10 nA. Counting times were 20s on the peak and 5s on each background. The standards used were: jadeite (Na), olivine San Carlos (Mg), disthene (Al), hypersthenes (Si), sanidine (K), diopside (Ca), Re metal (Re), Cr2O3 (Cr), fayalite (Fe), rutile (Ti) and rhodonite (Mn).\n4.\tResults\n4.1.\tExperimental textures and phase associations\nIn this work we report results of melting experiments performed on kimberlitic compositions at 1 atm, 1.8 GPa and 6 GPa. The run products are well crystallized, showing equilibrium among all phases and the presence of glass in all samples, which is in some experiments quenched. Back-scattered electron images from figure 1 show homogeneous phases with no significant zoning in terms of major element composition.\nDifferent phase assemblages were obtained among the experiments due to changes in composition, pressure and oxygen fugacity. The 1 atm run at oxidizing conditions (1250\u00b0C -24h) (F-2) crystallized olivine, clinopyroxene, perovskite and spinel (Fig. 1a) and the run product at 1 atm (1250\u00b0C - 24h) under reducing conditions (F-3) crystallized olivine,\nclinopyroxene and perovskite (Fig. 1b). Crystals are euhedral to slightly subhedral, and range in size from about 5 to 20 pm.\nIn experiments performed at 1.8 GPa and 1300\u00b0C (24h) (PC-22 and PC-24), perovskite crystallized in a kimberlitic composition equilibrated at oxygen fugacity equivalent to those of the Re-ReO2 buffer (oxidizing conditions) and C-CO buffer (reducing conditions) (Fig. 1d and f). In both experiments, olivine and clinopyroxene are crystallized in equilibrium with perovskites crystals. In experiment PC-22 (oxidizing conditions), crystals are euhedral to subhedral and range in size from 3 to 15 pm. Localized parts of the melt show quench features, but in general the glass is enough for good-quality analyses. The reducing conditions run (PC-24) present some large crystals of olivine, clinopyroxene and perovskite (10 to 100pm) in a large amount of silicate melt quenched to glass. Figure 1 (c and e) show examples of the two kinds of capsules: double capsule Pt-Re for oxidizing conditions experiments; and double capsule Pt-graphite for reducing conditions experiments.\nAs shown in figure 1 (g and h), the experiments at 1.8 GPa and 1250\u00b0C (24h) with H2O and CO2 in the starting composition (PC-27 and PC-30) show different paragenesis due to changes in oxygen fugacity conditions. The oxidizing conditions run present euhedral to subhedral smaller crystals of clinopyroxene, perovskite, titanite and rutile, ranging in size from 2-10 pm, while larger spinel crystals (up to 30 pm) are present in the reducing conditions run, together with smaller clinopyroxene and perovskite grains, all of them surrounded by melt. There is no olivine crystallized in both experiments with H2O and CO2.\nThe 6 GPa runs at 1350\u00b0C (24h), on oxidizing and reducing conditions (MA-9 and MA-8), crystallized euhedral to subhedral clinopyroxene (up to 20 pm), perovskite and spinel (1 to 5 pm), but olivine was not found (Fig. 1 i and j). The most abundant phase is clinopyroxene. Melt is present but not preserved as glass.\nFig. 1: Back-scattered electron images of representative experimental run products: (A) F-2: 1 atm/1250\u00b0C (24h) - oxidizing conditions; (B) F-3: 1 atm/1250\u00b0C (24h) - reducing conditions; (C) PC-22: Pt capsule lined on the inside with a Re foil for oxidizing conditions; (D) PC-22: 1.8 GPa/1300\u00b0C (24h) - oxidizing conditions; (E) PC-24: graphite capsule for reducing conditions; (F) PC-24: 1.8 GPa/1300\u00b0C (24h) - reducing conditions; (G) PC-27: 1.8GPa/1250\u00b0C (24h) - oxidizing conditions; (H) PC-30: 1.8GPa/1250\u00b0C (24h) - reducing conditions; (I) MA-9: 6 GPa/1350\u00b0C (24h) - oxidizing conditions; (J) MA-8: 6 GPa/1350\u00b0C\n(24h) - reducing conditions. The phases present in images are: perovskite (pv), olivine (ol), clinopyroxene (cpx) and spinel (sp), titanite (tit), in addition to quenched melt.\nIn agreement with Bellis and Canil (2007), the crystallization of perovskite is virtually independent of fO2 and controlled primarily by pressure, temperature and liquid composition, i.e. mainly driven by TiO2 and SiO2 activities in melts. We could only find olivine in experiments at 1 atm and 1.8 GPa without H2O and CO2. Experiments at 1.8 GPa with H2O and CO2 and at 6 GPa do not contain olivine. Alternatively, these experiments contain large amounts of clinopyroxene and spinel, or clinopyroxene, titanite and rutile in one of them (LC-27).\n4.2.\tPhase compositions\nAccording to the microprobe data (Table 3 and 4), olivines from all experiments are Mg-rich (Mg# from 0.76 to 0.98) with FeO concentrations of about 1-13wt.%. Clinopyroxenes show Mg# from 0.77 to 0.91 and are SiO2 (from 43.17wt.% to 52.92wt%) and CaO (from 22.07 to 40.12) rich. Perovskites are SiO2-poor (0.03 to 2.19wt.%), and CaO and TiO2 enriched, near to 39 wt.% and 57wt.%, respectively.\nThe Fe contents in olivine and clinopyroxene from 1 atm experiments (F-2 and F-3) are lower in the experiment under oxidizing conditions (1.1wt.% in olivine and 1.6wt.% in clinopyroxene), than in reducing conditions (13.5wt.% in olivine and 3.6wt.% in cpx). In contrast, the Fe content in perovskite is higher (1.2wt.%) in oxidizing conditions relative to reducing conditions (1.1wt.%), which is explained by the higher concentration of Fe in reducing conditions parts of the mantle, while the Fe is oxidized to Fe in more oxidized regions. Spinel is only present in oxidizing conditions runs, and has 68.9 wt.% of Fe, which could decrease the concentration of Fe in olivine and clinopyroxene. Despite the presence of\n3+ spinel, the Fe in perovskite is still higher than in the experiment without spinel, from reducing conditions.\nAs shown in table 3, olivine and clinopyroxene from oxidizing conditions experiment at 1.8 GPa (PC-22) have lower contents of Fe (8.0 and 3.4 wt.%) compared to olivine and clinopyroxene from reducing conditions experiment (11.2 and 3.3 wt.%, respectively) at the same pressure and temperature (PC-24). Perovskite contains slightly higher contents of Fe (0.72 wt.%) in oxidizing conditions than in runs at reducing conditions (0.66 wt.%). This behavior is supported by McCammon et al. (2004), who show that Fe in perovskite is controlled mainly by oxygen fugacity, occupying sites in octahedral coordination through the stabilization of cation vacancies in the structure of the perovskite.\nExperiments at the same pressure but with the addition of H2O and CO2 indicate a different paragenesis. In the experiment at oxidizing conditions (PC-27) rutile and titanite crystallized, in addition to clinopyroxene and perovskite, with low contents of FeO (0.23 to 0.24 wt.%). Thereafter, the experiment at reducing conditions (PC-30) contains spinel grains, instead of rutile and titanite. Spinels are very rich in TiO2 (58.7 wt.%) and also have high content of FeO (20.1 wt.%). The Fe content of clinopyroxene is higher in reducing conditions (2.6 wt.%) and Fe of perovskite is higher in runs under oxidizing conditions (1.5 wt.%).\nThe 6 GPa run products show the same paragenesis for oxidizing and reducing conditions, i.e. clinopyroxene, perovskite, spinel and quenched melt. Spinels are rich in TiO2 and FeO, while clinopyroxene and perovskite are similar in composition at both oxygen fugacities. Clinopyroxene contain slightly higher FeO in reducing conditions, and perovskite have slightly higher FeO content at oxidizing conditions (Table 3).\nrun#\tPhase\tSiO2\tAM>;\tFeO\tMgO\tCaO\tTiO2\tK2O\tNazO\tTotal\nF-2\tOl (20)\t42.2(0.4)\tn.d.\t1.1(0.1)\t55.7(0.4)\t1.7(0.2)\t0.2(0.2)\t0.01(0.02)\t0.02(0.02)\t100.9\n\tCpx (10)\t44(0.3)\t0.5(0.2)\t1.6(0.3)\t13.5(0.4)\t39.9(0.6)\t0.2(0.09)\t0.01(0.03)\t0.6(0.1)\t100.2\n\tPv (4)\t2.2(1.4)\t0.06(0.04)\t1.2(0.4)\t0.6(0.3)\t39.2(1.1)\t55.9(3.5)\tn.d.\t0.6(0.2)\t99.9\n\tSp (10)\t0.2(0.8)\t0.9(0.04)\t69(1)\t22.6(0.4)\t0.5(0.8)\t5.7(0.3)\t0.01(0.04)\t0.02(0.03)\t98.8\n\tMelt (9)\t35.2(1.4)\t0.9(0.1)\t15.1(1.9)\t8.8(1.2)\t26.1(1.6)\t12.9(2.6)\t0.04(0.06)\t1(0.2)\t100\nF-3\tOl (5)\t39.2(0.7)\tn.d.\t13.5(0.6)\t42.8(0.9)\t3.3(0.2)\t0.3(0.1)\tn.d.\tn.d.\t99.2\n\tCpx (7)\t43.2(0.4)\t0.3(0.06)\t3.6(0.9)\t11.7(0.6)\t40.1(0.3)\t0.2(0.06)\tn.d.\t0.1(0.04)\t99.2\n\tPv (5)\t0.1(0.04)\t0.08(0.03)\t1.1(0.4)\t0.09(0.03)\t40.7(0.4)\t57.3(0.7)\tn.d.\t0.04(0.02)\t99.4\n\tMelt (12)\t35.9(2.4)\t1.7(0.4)\t17.2(1.8)\t6.7(3.4)\t26.2(1.6)\t12.1(2.9)\t0.02(0.03)\t0.07(0.07)\t100\nPC-22\tOl (5)\t40.3(0.6)\t0.03(0.02)\t8(0.5)\t50.6(0.5)\t0.5(0.05)\t0.2(0.1)\t0.02(0.05)\tn.d.\t99.7\n\tCpx (5)\t50.4(1.1)\t1.8(0.5)\t3.0(0.4)\t17.5(0.4)\t22.6(0.5)\t3.2(0.7)\t0.06(0.05)\t0.06(0.03)\t98.7\n\tPv (5)\t0.03(0.05)\t0.1(0.02)\t0.7(0.2)\t0.2(0.06)\t39.2(0.5)\t57.8(1.1)\t0.2(0.08)\t0.05(0.07)\t98.3\n\tMelt (6)\t28.4(0.7)\t3.3(0.2)\t10(0.6)\t11.6(0.3)\t16.3(0.5)\t27.5(1.8)\t2.8(0.2)\t0.2(0.2)\t100\nPC-24\tOl (5)\t40.0(0.4)\t0.03(0.04)\t11.2(0.3)\t48.3(0.4)\t0.6(0.1)\t0.2(0.06)\t0.01(0.01)\t0.02(0.04)\t100.4\n\tCpx (5)\t49.8(0.6)\t2.4(0.4)\t3.3(0.2)\t17.2(0.2)\t22.7(0.5)\t4.1(0.4)\t0.03(0.06)\t0.06(0.04)\t99.5\n\tPv (5)\t0.03(0.02)\t0.1(0.02)\t0.7(0.2)\t0.2(0.02)\t39.5(0.7)\t58.9(0.8)\t0.09(0.06)\t0.06(0.06)\t99.5\n\tMelt (5)\t28.9(0.7)\t3.30(0.07)\t12.1(0.8)\t10.3(0.4)\t16.2(1.0)\t24.5(0.3)\t2.4(0.4)\t2.4(0.08)\t100\nPC-27\tCpx (6)\t48.2(2.7)\t4.1(1.0)\t1.6(0.2)\t17.3(1.1)\t22.5(0.7)\t4.1(2.1)\t0.2(0.1)\t0.15(0.05)\t98.3\n\tPv (6)\t0.07(0.04)\t0.2(0.04)\t0.37(0.06)\t0.18(0.04)\t39.0(0.5)\t57.8(0.6)\t0.2(0.08)\t0.05(0.04)\t98.9\n\tRut (3)\t0.05(0.05)\t0.3(0.06)\t0.2(0.07)\t0.09(0.02)\t0.4(0.4)\t97.2(0.3)\t0.1(0.07)\tn.d.\t98.5\n\tTit (5)\t28.7(0.3)\t0.5(0.08)\t0.2(0.1)\t0.5(0.2)\t27(0.3)\t41.1(1.0)\t0.2(0.1)\t0.03(0.03)\t98.3\n\tMelt (5)\t30.4(1.7)\t5.7(0.6)\t3.8(0.7)\t13.3(0.9)\t22.8(1.9)\t17.4(1.8)\t6(0.7)\t0.6(0.3)\t100\nPC-30\tCpx (4)\t51.2(1.2)\t2.7(0.3)\t2.6(0.1)\t17(0.5)\t23.3(0.1)\t3.4(0.5)\t0.1(0.07)\t0.2(0.09)\t100.6\n\tPv (13)\t0.3(0.7)\t0.2(0.1)\t0.6(0.3)\t0.2(0.2)\t40.4(0.9)\t57.1(1.0)\t0.2(0.2)\t0.03(0.04)\t99.0\n\tSp (7)\t0.1(0.4)\t0.7(0.2)\t20(5)\t17(4)\t2.5(9)\t58.7(0.8)\t0.03(0.04)\t0.01(0.03)\t99.1\n\tMelt (3)\t35(2.2)\t6.2(0.4)\t8.3(1.3)\t8(2)\t14.7(1.6)\t19.5(2.2)\t7.5(1.6)\t0.7(0.2)\t100\nMA-9\tCpx (4)\t52.9(1.6)\t1.5(0.3)\t3.6(0.3)\t16.8(0.9)\t22.1(0.3)\t0.7(0.07)\t0.7(1)\t0.3(0.06)\t98.5\n\tPv (5)\t0.3(0.4)\t0.2(0.09)\t1.1(0.2)\t0.2(0.1)\t37.5(1.2)\t57(0.8)\t1(0.4)\t0.08(0.08)\t97.4\n\tSp (5)\t0.3(0.1)\t1.0 (0.02)\t29.9(0.4)\t12.7(0.2)\t0.8(0.5)\t53.5(0.3)\t0.4(0.1)\t0.02(0.06)\t98.9\n\tMelt (6)\t32.5(11.9)\t3.6(0.8)\t12.6(5.7)\t12.6(5.5)\t16.6(11.6)\t15(8.9)\t6.8(5.5)\t0.3(0.2)\t100\nMA-8\tCpx (4)\t52.3(0.4)\t2.2(0.6)\t3.6(0.3)\t17(0.3)\t22.3(0.4)\t1.1(0.3)\t0.2 (0.04)\t0.2 (0.03)\t99.0\n\tPv (7)\t0.2(0.1)\t0.2(0.06)\t1.1(0.2)\t0.2(0.07)\t38.5(0.7)\t58.3(1.1)\t0.3(0.09)\t0.05(0.05)\t98.7\n\tSp (3)\t0.09(0.04)\t1.16(0.005)\t28(0.5)\t13.1(0.06)\t0.3(0.1)\t57.9(0.9)\t0.07(0.06)\t0.05(0.03)\t100.6\nTable 3: Major element compositions (wt.%) of experimental run products.

As perovskite only incorporates ferric iron (Fe ), the Fetotal of perovskites, as measured with electron microprobe, equates to ferric iron. Our data show that the ferric iron in perovskite is a strong function of fO2 in our experiments. With increasing fO2 at 1 atm or at high pressures (1.8 and 6 GPa), the amount of ferric iron in perovskite will also increase. However, there is quite a spread of the data, e.g. at 1.8 GPa, our data shows quite variable Fe content of perovskite. This data spread is caused by different modal proportions of olivine, and most importantly, perovskite in our runs. For comparison, we also plotted Fe3+ content of perovskites from the Bellis and Canil (2007) experiments, and different fO2. Both our data and the Bellis and Canil (2007) data show considerable spread of the Fe content of perovskite. Therefore, the simple oxybarometer which links Fe content with fO2 Bellis and Canil (2007) can certainly be improved by a more refined treatment of the data.\n3+\nFig. 2: The diagram presents the amount of Fe in perovskite versus fO2 plotted in terms of ANNO (Frost, 1991). Filled symbols represent experiments using the C-CO buffer (Ulmer and Luth, 1991); empty symbols represent experiments using the Re-ReO2 buffer (Campbell et al., 2009); crosses represent Bellis and Canil (2007) data. The *experiments denote runs that contain H2O and CO2.\nOur overall aim is to calculate fO2 of kimberlite melts using the Fe content of minerals. It is fortuitous that our experiments and in fact, many natural kimberlites contain two minerals that only incorporate one sort of Fe: perovskite mainly incorporates Fe , and olivine is known to incorporates mainly Fe . We use these simple facts to constrain the Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio of the melt by measuring Fe in olivine and perovskite using electron microprobe analyses of coexisting phases. Using this simple ruse, we developed an equation for kimberlitic melts saturated in these phases, which enable us to calculate whether a kimberlite is more oxidized or not, and whether diamonds are likely to have been absorbed during the ascent of the melt to the surface or not.\nIn order to use this equation, however, the D (distribution coefficient) of iron between olivine and melt, and perovskite and melt, is needed. The distribution coefficient represents\nthe Fe exchange between olivine and melt, and perovskite and melt. This parameter depends mainly on temperature, but also on composition:\n(meZt) = Fe >\nFe 2+\tFe 2+\n(1)\n2_|_ where ol is olivine, pv is perovskite, D(ol/melt) is the distribution coefficient of Fe between olivine and melt, and D(pv/melt) is the distribution coefficient of Fe between perovskite and melt. D(ol/melt) has been measured many times in experimental studies (i.e. Roeder and Emslie, 1970; Toplis, 2005) and the average value for D(ol/melt) is 0.3, valid over wide ranges of temperature and composition. D(pv/melt) was calculated from our experiments (Table 5) and from Bellis and Canil (2007) data. In the experiments without olivine (e.g. the runs at 1.8 GPa with H2O and CO2 and at 6 GPa) the Fe content was calculated from the Fe contents in olivine from other experiments with the same oxygen fugacity condition.\nrun#\tP(GPa)\tT\u00b0C\tANNO\tDFe(pv/melt)\tDFe(ol/melt)\tFe3+/Fe2+(melt)\nLF-2\t1 atm\t1250\t6.3\t0.09\t0.3\t3.5(0.18)\nLF-3\t1 atm\t1250\t-2.1\t0.07\t0.3\t0.3(0.02)\nPC-22\t1.8GPa\t1300\t1.4\t0.08\t0.3\t0.4(0.02)\nPC-24\t1.8GPa\t1300\t-1.7\t0.06\t0.3\t0.3(0.01)\nPC-27\t1.8GPa\t1250\t1.4\t0.12\t0.3\t0.4(0.02)\nPC-30\t1.8GPa\t1250\t-1.6\t0.08\t0.3\t0.2(0.01)\nMA-9\t6GPa\t1350\t1.5\t0.10\t0.3\t0.7(0.03)\nMA-8\t6GPa\t1350\t-1.0\t0.07\t0.3\t0.6(0.03)\nTable 5: Results of DFe(pv/melt) calculated from our experiments, DFe(ol/melt) is from literature data (i.e. Roeder and Emslie, 1970; Toplis, 2005).

Both our data and the Bellis and Canil (2007) data show a good correlation between the fO2 of the experiments and the fO2 calculated from the oxygen barometer equation (2). A larger divergence between oxygen\nANNO experiment\nFigure 4: A scatter plot of multiple linear regression of experimental data (Equation 2 and Table 6) shows a comparison offO2 (relative to NNO buffer) of calculations, based on the oxybarometer equation (2) (y axis), and experiments (x axis). Symbols: white circles represent experiments at 1 atm; grey circles, 1.8 GPa; black circles, 6.0 GPa; white squares are Bellis and Canil (2007) experiments. Error bars of 2 o from all experiments.\nEquation (2) is applicable to kimberlite rocks that contain perovskite and olivine in a range of fO2 of ANNO -2 to +6. In order to use this equation, however, the FeO content (Fetotal) in perovskites and olivines is needed, as well as calculated temperature and pressure of formation. Contrasting from Bellis and Canil (2007) oxygen barometer, the modal proportions of olivine and perovskite in the rock are also required, considering that the\n2_|_\t3_i_\ncontents of Fe in olivines and Fe in perovskites may vary depending on the total amount of crystallized minerals in the kimberlitic rock. Using the Fe content in olivine and perovskite we can better understand the redox state of the melt and consequent potential of this rock to preserve diamonds. Since the diamond preservation grade has a negative correlation with the increasing offO2, the more reduced kimberlite rock has a greater chance that the diamonds carried by this rock from the deep mantle will be preserved than in rocks that have a higher oxygen fugacity. When diamonds are exposed to oxidized melts, they can easily react and form CO2 or carbonates. According Fedortchouk et al. (2007), a fluid rich in H2O and CO2 that percolate a kimberlite rock during its ascent, will oxidize the melt and produce different dissolution surface features in the diamonds, with similar oxidation rates.\nThe range of observed fO2 values represents variations in the oxidation/reduction processes in the kimberlite magmas. Thus, perovskite and olivine compositions can be used to investigate the relationship between the fO2 of the melt, calculated from FeO content and modal proportion of the minerals, and the diamond preservation in a kimberlitic rock. However, the fO2 of a kimberlite melt changes depending on a number of factors that need to be considered with respect to diamond preservation, e.g. the velocity of eruption, the volatile content of the melt and the mixing with other magmas and fluids (Fedortchouk et al., 2005 and Ogilvie-Harris et al., 2009).\n5.\tConclusions\nWe have demonstrated that ferric iron concentration in perovskites from kimberlitic melts increases with increasing fO2, under 1 atm, 1.8 and 6 GPa. These parameters are correlated under high pressure and in the experiments with H2O and CO2. Temperature and liquid composition, instead oxygen fugacity, are strong variables in controlling phase\nThe oxygen barometer developed in this study (equation 2) reproduces all experimental data, at more reducing and more oxidizing conditions, and is applicable to kimberlite rocks that contain perovskite and olivine. For calculations, FeO content and modal proportion of olivines and perovskites are needed, as well as temperature and pressure estimates of the melt formation.\nSince kimberlites experience multiple stages of crystallization under changing conditions during ascent, the Fe content and modes of perovskites and olivines is an important tool to estimate the redox conditions of the rock in some part of this complex event. This information is of great importance to predict diamond quality and, therefore, the value of a kimberlite pipe.\nAknowledgments\nWe would like to thank funding from CNPq (National Counsel of Technological and Scientific Development) and the Science without Borders Program from Brazil.

Its geochemical signature is similar to those of transitional kimberlites of Kaapvaal Craton, Southern Africa, and U-Pb ages of ~ 128 Ma on CaTiO3-perovskites (Concei\u00e7\u00e3o et al., in prep.) reveal that Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite probably erupted just after the volcanism of Paran\u00e1-Etendeka Province. Based on petrographic evidences as the presence of phlogopites, serpentinized olivines and carbonates, and the major and trace element compositions of the minerals, we suggest that the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite mantle source is product of the reaction of a silicate-carbonate liquid in the mantle. The high Ti content of some minerals as Mg-chromite, Mg-ulvospinel, phlogopite and melilite, and the presence of CaTiO3-perovskite, suggest a Ti-rich source, whereas the calculated melt composition based on Ros\u00e1rio do Sul phlogopites, CaTiO3-perovskites and apatites trace\nKeywords: mantle heterogeneity; kimberlite source; mineral chemistry; CO2-rich fluids; recycling of a subducted slab\n1.\tIntroduction\nKimberlites are undersaturated rocks (from 30 to 40 wt.% SiO2), which contain abundant amount of volatiles (CO2 + H2O) and high concentrations of incompatible elements (Mitchell, 1986). Most of the authors agree that kimberlites are formed by small degrees of partial melting of upper mantle peridotite at more than 100 km depth (around 3 GPa) (e.g., Wedephohl and Muramatsu, 1979), and generally have a rapid ascent related to small crust extension movements (e.g. Bailey, 1993).\nIn Brazil, the most researched kimberlite occurrences are found in the central and in the northwest part of the country; e.g. the kimberlitic pipes in the Juina area, in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul (Kaminsky, et.al, 2009). However, some recent studies (Chaves et al., 2014; Adri\u00e3o, 2015; Provenzano, 2016; Concei\u00e7\u00e3o et al., in prep.) has provided information about kimberlitic magmatism also in the southernmost part of Brazil, at the State of Rio Grande do Sul.\nRos\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite is a transitional kimberlite that belongs to the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul Kimberlitic Province (Edler et al., 1998), located in the southeastern edge of the Paran\u00e1 Basin, in the southernmost part of Brazil. The Ros\u00e1rio do Sul geochemical signature is\nsimilar to the Group I kimberlites and to the transitional kimberlites from the Kaapvaal Craton, Southern Africa (Concei\u00e7\u00e3o et al., in prep.). The geochemical and isotopic data (Concei\u00e7\u00e3o et al., in prep.) suggests that the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite source is a depleted mantle metasomatized by carbonatitic liquids. U-Pb ages of ~ 128 Ma on CaTiO3-perovskites (Concei\u00e7\u00e3o et al., in prep.) reveal that Ros\u00e1rio do Sul probably erupted just after the volcanism of Paran\u00e1-Etendeka Province at ~ 132 Ma (Renne et al., 1992, 1996; Turner et al., 1994; Ernesto et al., 2002), which suggests that the processes related to mantle metasomatism and the heat source responsible for kimberlite generation and ascension could be related to the process that triggered the Paran\u00e1-Etendeka magmatism in an extensional environment. This hypothesis indicates the presence of mantle heterogeneity on the source of Paran\u00e1 continental flood basalts due to percolation of carbonatitic melts. Other alkaline events occur in the border of Paran\u00e1-Etendeka Province as the Lages complex (70-77 Ma; Gibson et al., 1999) and Arax\u00e1 complex (89 Ma; e.g. Hasui and Cordani, 1968), that include carbonatite and lamprophyres from the Late Cretaceous (from 60 Ma to 90 Ma). Comin-Chiaramonti et al. (2002) found that the Early Cretaceous Anit\u00e1polis alkaline-carbonatitic complex (~132 Ma; Sonoki and Garda, 1988), which is located 100km far from the basalts of Paran\u00e1-Etendeka magmatism (Santa Catarina state in the South of Brazil), and in general the Early Cretaceous analogues, e.g. Ponta Grossa Arch (Brazil), Paraguay and Uruguay, are concomitant with the main flood tholeiites of the Paran\u00e1 Basin and, therefore, occurred during the early stages of rifting, before the continental separation. They also suggest that the alkaline-carbonatitic magmatism in Southern Brazil is concentrated in regions affected by regional thermal anomalies in the deep mantle (Ernesto et al., 2002) which offer an alternative non-plume-related heat source for the generation of intracontinental magmatic provinces. Furthermore, a number of authors (Turner et al., 1994; Turner and Hawkesworth, 1995; Peate and Hawkesworth, 1996; Comin-Chiaramonti et al., 1997; Peat et al., 1999 and\nMarques et al., 1999) emphasize that the Tristan da Cunha mantle plume could have only acted as a thermal perturbation that may triggered the Paran\u00e1 flood basalt generation, without any influence in its source. Bellieni et al. (1984), Peate et al. (1999) and Marques et al. (1999), based on the chemical and isotopic data, proposed a heterogeneous lithospheric mantle melting as the source of the Paran\u00e1 flood basalts, whereas, Rocha-J\u00fanior et al. (2012, 2013) shown Re-Os and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic results indicating that the asthenospheric source of the basalts was enriched by fluids or magmas related to the Neoproterozoic subduction processes.\nThis research shows major and trace element compositions of the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite minerals, and our aim is to drive considerations regarding the kimberlite source and its relation to the Paran\u00e1 flood basalts event and the South Atlantic opening. The focus of this study is based on the relation between composition of incompatible trace elements and the mantle origin of the kimberlite magma.\n2.\tGeological setting and samples\nThe Ros\u00e1rio do Sul Kimberlitic Province, which contains four clusters of kimberlitic/lamproitic rocks (S\u00e3o Gabriel, Capivaras, S\u00e3o Xavier and Ros\u00e1rio do Sul), is located in the southeastern edge of the Paran\u00e1 Basin, in the southernmost part of Brazil. This kimberlitic province is embedded in Phanerozoic sandstones of the Piramboia formation of the Paran\u00e1 Basin and occurs distributed throughout NW-SE oriented structures, generally in the intersections of the Ibar\u00e9 lineament and younger faults (Adri\u00e3o, 2015 and Edler et al., 1998). We will focus our study in the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul cluster, since is the only cluster of the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul Kimberlitic Province with cohesive rocks able to generate good quality samples for geochemical analysis.\nThe Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlitic rocks investigated in this study are from a hypabyssal body associated to a root zone or a feeder magma dyke (Concei\u00e7\u00e3o et al., in prep.). The Ros\u00e1rio do Sul outcrop occurs in the Ibicu\u00ed River and is exposed for ~7 m . Only fresher samples were selected for the present study, providing thin sections in which the inequigranular texture is observed, with several crystal sizes ranging from megacrysts (> 10 mm), to macrocrysts (2-10 mm) and microphenocrysts (&lt;2 mm) in a very fine groundmass. The samples have a fine-grained microporphyritic texture with olivine megacrysts from peridotite mantle xenoliths and pelletal lapilli immersed in a heterogeneous and segregated matrix. The Ros\u00e1rio do Sul mineral assemblage consists of macrocrysts and microphenocrysts of olivine, and microphenocrysts of phlogopite and apatite, all immersed in a groundmass of serpentinized olivines, monticellites, melilites, phlogopites, CaTiO3-perovskites, Mg-chromites, Mg-ulvospinels and apatites. Furthermore, a mesostasis of phlogopite, soda melilite, akermanite and carbonate is concomitant to the groundmass. The petrography is better described in Concei\u00e7\u00e3o et al. (in prep.).\n3.\tAnalytical methods\nRos\u00e1rio do Sul thin sections were first described using an optical microscopy and a scanning electron microscopy SEM - JEOL JSM 6610LV. Mineral compositions from Ros\u00e1rio do Sul thin sections were determined using a JEOL JXA 8530F electron microprobe at the Institut f\u00fcr Mineralogie, M\u00fcnster. Microprobe analyses were performed using an accelerating voltage of 15 kV, a beam current of 10 nA and counting times of 20s on the peak and 5s on each background. The standards used were: jadeite (Na), San Carlos olivine (Mg), disthene (Al), hypersthenes (Si), sanidine (K), diopside (Ca), Cr2O3 (Cr), fayalite (Fe), rutile (Ti) and rhodonite (Mn).\nTrace element concentrations of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul thin sections were determined by spot analyses with a laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometre LA-ICP-MS at the Institut f\u00fcr Mineralogie, M\u00fcnster. Sample ablation was performed with a pulsed 193 nm ArF excimer laser (Analyte G2, Photon Machines). A repetition rate of 5 or 10 Hz and energy of ~ 3-4 J/cm were used throughout the entire session. The beam spot diameter varied between 15 and 30 pm. Elemental analysis has been carried out with an Element 2 mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher). Forward power was 1300 W and reflected power &lt;2 W, gas flow rates were about 1 l/m for He (carrier gas of ablated material), 0.7 l/m and 0.9 l/m for the Ar-auxiliary and sample gas, respectively. Cooling gas flow rate was set to 16 l/min. Before starting analysis, the system (torch position, lenses, gas flows) has been tuned on a NIST 612 reference glass measuring 139La, 232Th and 232Th16O to get stable signals and high sensitivity, as well as low oxide rates (232Th16O/232Th &lt;0.1%) during ablation. A total of 32 elements was quantitatively analyzed using the NIST 612 glass as an external reference material and Si, Ca (silicates), Ti (Fe-Ti-oxides) and Mg (spinels) as internal standards, which have been previously determined by electron microprobe. Overall time of a single analysis was 75s (20s for background, 40s for peak after switching laser on, 15s washout time). Concentrations of measured elements were calculated using the Glitter software (Griffin et al., 2008 and Van Achterbergh et al., 2001). Standard reference glasses BCR2-G and BIR1-G were analyzed as monitor for precision and accuracy for silicate phases of the course of this study. Obtained results match the published range of concentrations given in the GeoReM database (version 18) (Jochum et al. 2005).\n4.\tResults\n4.1.\tMineral compositions\nOlivine\nOlivine is the most abundant mineral in the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite. Olivine megacrysts (> 10 mm) are resultants of disaggregated mantle xenoliths, as described by Concei\u00e7\u00e3o et al. (in prep.). These olivine megacrystals are widespread and represent around 20 vol.% of the total volume of the rock, however, they cannot be considered to understand the crystallization process of the kimberlite. Olivine macrocrysts (2-10 mm) and microphenocrysts (&lt;2 mm) are dispersive in a segregated groundmass (Fig. 1a - d). The olivine macrocrysts are rounded, with euhedral to subhedral shape and present relict cores and serpentinized rims. These serpentinized rims and the microphenocrysts commonly have inclusions of Mg-chromite and melt pockets, which contain a mixture of melt, phlogopite, apatite, melilite and CaTiO3-perovskite (Fig. 1a, b and f). Some olivine macrocrysts and microphenocrysts are partially enclosed by a necklace texture of CaTiO3-perovskite and monticellite. The chemical composition of olivine macrocrystals ranges from Fo80-92 in the fresh cores and Fo89-97 in the serpentinized rims, while olivine microphenocrysts are always completely serpentinized and have chemical composition equal to the megacrysts serpentinized rims. The iron content (from 5 to 6 wt.%) and MgO content (from 31 to 36 wt.%) of the serpentinized olivines (macrocrystal rims and microphenocrysts) are lower than those of olivine macrocrystal cores (from 10 to 13 wt.% FeO and from 47 to 49 wt.% MgO) (Table 1). The groundmass olivines (5 - 15 |im) are completely serpentinized, enriched in Al2O3 (~ 8 - 14 wt.%) and show composition from Fo78-84, where Fo = 100*[Mg/(Mg+Fe)]\nin mol%. They commonly occur surrounding olivine macrocrysts and microphenocrysts together with CaTiO3-perovskite and monticellite.\nFig. 1: Backscattered electron images of the thin sections from Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite\nshowing representative textures and minerals of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite.

Detailed data of major and trace elements can be found in Supplementary data.\nMonticellite\nMonticellite is a very common mineral in Group I kimberlites, usually absent in Group II kimberlites and lamproites (Mitchell, 1995) and its occurrence suggests that the pressure\nof crystallization of this rock is not higher than ~ 3 GPa (Edgar et al., 1988). The structure of monticellite is essentially the same as that of the (Mg,Fe)-olivines with an expanded unit cell due to the replacement of half of the (Mg,Fe) by Ca (Deer et al., 1992). Ros\u00e1rio do Sul monticellites (5 - 20 pm) occur in the groundmass, surrounding olivine macrocrysts and microphenocrysts. They are commonly subhedral to anhedral with borders partially or completely corroded and replaced to serpentine (Fig. 1A). They have Mg-chromite and CaTiO3-perovskite inclusions which suggest that they crystallize after these minerals, and prior to late-stage primary groundmass minerals. The chemical composition of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul monticellites is very homogeneous, with solid solutions of monticellite (CaMgSiO4 - 92 mol%), and kirschsteinite (CaFeSiO4 - 8 mol%). The iron, magnesium and silica contents of monticellite in Ros\u00e1rio do Sul (~ 7 wt.% FeO, ~ 22 wt.% MgO, and 36.9 - 37.8 wt.% SiO2) is lower than that of olivine (10 - 13 wt.% FeO, 47 - 49 MgO, and ~ 40wt.% SiO2), while the CaO content (~ 32 wt.%) is higher (Table 3). Compared to monticellites from the Leslie kimberlite (Canada), Ros\u00e1rio do Sul monticellites have a very similar composition, excepting the Fe content which is significantly higher in Ros\u00e1rio do Sul monticellites (Abersteiner et al., in press). Ros\u00e1rio do Sul monticellites present low abundance of trace elements (Table 2), with low to moderate contents of Ni (552 - 555 ppm), Sr (175 - 589 ppm), Nb (0.1 - 137 ppm), Ba (162 - 191 ppm), La (3.2 - 167 ppm), Ce (7.3 - 349 ppm) and Nd (4.7 - 142 ppm), compared to other Ros\u00e1rio do Sul minerals, as spinels and phlogopites.\nSample\tMonticellite\tMelilite\n(n.o.a.)\tCAR3A(4) CA03D(14)\t\tCAR301(5)\tCAR3I(2)\tCA03D(1) CAR301(6)\t\nSiO2\t37.8(0.4)\t37.0(0.5)\t37.6(0.2)\t36.9(0.1)\t40.5\t24.6(0.4)\nTiO2\t0.11(0.03)\t0.13(0.07)\t0.11(0.04)\t0.101(0.004)\t0.08\t2.9(0.1)\nAl2O3\tn.d.\t0.04(0.08)\t0.01(0.01)\tn.d.\t7.34\t12.6(0.3)\nFeO*\t7.4(0.3)\t7.6(0.7)\t7.1(0.2)\t7.1(0.5)\t1.43\t9.2(0.3)\nMnO\t0.29(0.04)\t0.30(0.03)\t0.28(0.04)\t0.312(0.007)\t0.08\t0.14(0.01)\nMgO\t22.2(0.5)\t22.2(0.4)\t22.8(0.4)\t22.03(0.05)\t3.49\t2.5(0.7)\nCaO\t32.2(0.2)\t31.7(0.2)\t32.0(0.2)\t32.8(0.1)\t31.4\t33(1)\nNa2O\t0.10(0.04)\t0.08(0.04)\t0.07(0.05)\t0.12(0.04)\t0.03\t0.07(0.01)\nK2O\t0.03(0.04)\t0.04(0.03)\t0.03(0.03)\t0.04(0.04)\t0.50\t0.3(0.1)\nCr2O3\tn.d.\t0.03(0.03)\t0.02(0.03)\tn.d.\t0.001\t0.33(0.05)\nTotal\t100.5\t99.3\t100.3\t99.4\t86\t86\nMo\t92\t91\t92\t92\t-\t-\nKi\t8.4\t8.7\t8.0\t8.0\t-\t-\nCations per formula unit based on 4 (monticellite) and 14 (melilite) oxygens.\nSi\t1.01\t1.002\t1.005\t0.997\t4.183\t2.784\nTi\t0.002\t0.003\t0.002\t0.002\t0.006\t0.246\nAl\t0\t0.001\t0\t0\t0.893\t1.673\nFe\t0.165\t0.172\t0.159\t0.160\t0.123\t0.867\nMn\t0.007\t0.007\t0.006\t0.007\t0.007\t0.013\nMg\t0.884\t0.895\t0.907\t0.888\t0.537\t0.419\nCa\t0.922\t0.920\t0.916\t0.950\t3.474\t4.014\nNa\t0.005\t0.004\t0.004\t0.006\t0.215\t0.016\nK\t0.001\t0.001\t0.001\t0.001\t0.066\t0.048\nCr\t0.027\t0.119\t0.072\t0\t0.001\t0.029\nTotal\t3.02\t3.12\t3.07\t3.01\t9.50\t10.13\nTable 3: Representative mineral compositions (wt.%) of monticellite and melilite minerals of the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite. *Total Fe reported as FeO. Notes: n.d., not detected; n.o.a., (x) number of analysis; all standard deviations are given in Io. as last significant digits in\nbrackets.\nMelilite\nMelilite are present in the segregated groundmass of the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite and frequently show reaction with the mesostasis. Melilite crystals range in size from 10 to 70 |im and are subhedral to anhedral. The subhedral crystals commonly present inclusions of phlogopite, olivine and CaTiO3-perovskite. Other textures as necklaces of CaTiO3-perovskite, and Mg-ulvospinel borders producing skeletal texture, are common (Fig. 1C, E and F). Subhedral melilite is also found together with monticellite as inclusions in the olivine macrocrysts and microphenocrysts borders, indicating a substitution of monticellite to melilite (Fig. 2). Anhedral melilite occurs in the groundmass and in the mesostasis, as acicular microlites. In the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul mesostasis (Fig. 1A), melilite and soda melilite are concomitant to akermanite, phlogopite and carbonate. The subhedral and anhedral melilites have compositions that vary from high SiO2 (40 wt.%) and low TiO2 (0.08 wt.%), Al2O3 (7.34 wt.%) and FeO (1.4 wt.%) contents, to low SiO2 (24.6 wt.%) and high TiO2 (2.9 wt.%), Al2O3 (12.6 wt.%) and FeO (9.2 wt.%) contents (Table 3). The MgO (from 2.5 to 3.5wt.%) and CaO (from 31 to 33 wt.%) contents are homogeneous in all crystals. Eventually, melilite crystals present Ti-zonation, with Ti-enriched cores and Fe-enriched rims.\nAccording to Concei\u00e7\u00e3o et al. (in prep.), Ros\u00e1rio do Sul monticellites and melilites are the product of a reaction between olivine and a liquid enriched in calcium and carbonate. CaO + Al2O3 and MgO + FeO diagram (Fig. 2) shows a comparison among olivine megacryst cores and serpentinized rims, serpentinized olivine microphenocrysts, serpentinized groundmass olivines, monticellites and melilites. According to the trend 1 (Fig. 2), the serpentinization of the groundmass olivine is a product of fresh olivine alteration, in which part of the Mg and Fe cations are replaced by Al.

Trend 1 represents the olivine serpentinization, whereas trend 2 shows the alteration of serpentinized olivine to Al-rich serpentinized olivine, monticellite and melilite.\nSpinel\nThe Ros\u00e1rio do Sul spinels have two different compositions: Mg-chromite, which has MgO and Cr2O3 contents from 13.7 to 15 wt.% and 41 to 43 wt.%, respectively; and Mg-ulvospinel, product of a solid solution between magnetite and ulvospinel, with FeO contents of 65.7 to 74 wt.% , TiO2 contents of 9 to 11 wt.%, and MgO contents of 6.5 to 9.5 wt.% (Table 4). Mg-chromites are euhedric to subhedric, from 5 to 10 |im and are usually found as inclusions in olivine macrocrysts and microphenocrysts (Fig.1B and D), being less often in the groundmass. Eventually, present zonations of Cr- and Al-enriched cores to Fe- and Ti-enriched rims. Mg-ulvospinels are euhedral to anhedral, from 10 to 40^m and are commonly found in the groundmass, but sometimes included in microphenocrysts of phlogopite, monticellite, CaTiO3-perovskite and apatite. Skeletal texture is observed, where Mg-ulvospinel border surrounds melilite, apatite, monticellite and olivine crystals (Fig.1A and E). There is a very common Fe-Ti zonation in the Mg-ulvospinel crystals, with Ti-enriched cores and Fe-enriched rims (Fig. 1C). Ti content probably was consumed during and after the crystallization of CaTiO3-perovskite, being replaced by Fe in the Mg-ulvospinel crystalline structure. This zonation indicates that crystallization of Mg-ulvospinel occurs after the CaTiO3-perovskite that probably consumed the major amount of Ti.\nSample (n.o.a.)\tMg-chromite\t\t\tMg-ulvospinel\t\t\n\tCA03D(2)\tCAR301(1) CAR3I(5)\t\tCAR3A(3)\tCA03D(10)\tCAR301(3)\nSiO2\t0.15(0.03)\t0.16\t0.14(0.01)\t0.07(0.01)\t0.07(0.02)\t0.06(0.02)\nTiO2\t1.6(0.1)\t1.47\t1.3(0.2)\t10.4(0.4)\t9(1)\t11.0(0.3)\nAl2O3\t19.2(0.3)\t19.3\t19(1)\t2.2(2.3)\t1.0(0.4)\t4.5(0.5)\nFeO*\t19.6(0.6)\t19.14\t21(2)\t72(5)\t74(4)\t65.7(0.8)\nMnO\t0.47(0.03)\t0.44\t0.42(0.02)\t0.57(0.03)\t0.55(0.04)\t0.55(0.04)\nMgO\t15.0(0.4)\t15.0\t13.7(0.2)\t7(2)\t6.5(0.4)\t9.5(0.4)\nCaO\t0.07(0.01)\t0.14\t0.03(0.01)\t0.19(0.08)\t0.25(0.09)\t0.3(0.1)\nNa2O\tn.d.\tn.d.\t0.02(0.01)\t0.01(0.01)\t0.02(0.02)\t0.05(0.02)\nK2O\tn.d.\t0.02\tn.d.\t0.03(0.03)\t0.02(0.02)\t0.03(0.03)\nCr2O3\t43(1)\t43.41\t41(1)\t1.5(0.9)\t3.4(4.4)\t2.5(0.3)\nTotal\t99.5\t99.2\t96.7\t94.5\t95.3\t94.6\nCations per formula unit based on 32 oxygens.\nSi\t0.037\t0.040\t0.038\t0.023\t0.021\t0.022\nTi\t0.298\t0.278\t0.265\t2.688\t2.442\t2.722\nAl\t5.687\t5.730\t5.713\t0.889\t0.425\t1.723\nFe\t4.121\t4.034\t4.639\t20.61\t21.42\t18.0\nMn\t0.101\t0.094\t0.093\t0.168\t0.163\t0.152\nMg\t5.641\t5.628\t5.347\t3.772\t3.349\t4.664\nCa\t0.020\t0.039\t0.008\t0.068\t0.092\t0.108\nNa\t0.002\t0.002\t0.009\t0.008\t0.017\t0.030\nK\t0\t0.006\t0.002\t0.012\t0.008\t0.014\nCr\t8.610\t8.648\t8.489\t0.409\t0.933\t0.656\nTotal\t24.52\t24.50\t24.60\t28.65\t28.87\t28.08\nTable 4: Representative mineral compositions (wt.%) of spinel group minerals of the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite. *Total Fe reported as FeO. Notes: n.d., not detected; n.o.a., (x) number of analysis; all standard deviations are given in 1o, as last significant digits in brackets.\nMg-chromite and Mg-ulvospinel of the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite are plotted in the Cr -\n2_|_\nAl - (Fe + 2Ti) diagram (Fig. 3) with spinels from: Alto Parana\u00edba kimberlites and\nkamafugites (Melluso et al., 2008), which have chemical affinities with the Group II kimberlites; Lac de Gras kimberlite (Canada) (Fedortchouk &amp; Canil, 2004), that present chemical affinities with Group I kimberlites; and kimberlites and a carbonatite from Arkhangelsk kimberlite province (Russia) (Beard et al., 2000). The Ros\u00e1rio do Sul Mg-chromites plot close to the Lac de Gras and Arkhangelsk spinels but have lower Cr content. Mg-ulvospinels plot very close to the Magnetite + Ulvospinel vertex, together with spinels from Arkhangelsk kimberlites and carbonatite.\nCr-spinel\nAl-spinel\tMagnetite + Ulvospinel\nFig. 3: Cr - Al - (Fe + 2Ti) diagram for spinel-group minerals. Spinels from the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite are plotted as filled (Mg-chromite) and open squares (Mg-ulvospinel); Alto Parana\u00edba kimberlites and kamafugites spinels are shown by open circles (Melluso et al., 2008) and represent spinels from Group II kimberlites; spinels from Lac de Gras kimberlite (Canada) are open diamonds (Fedortchouk &amp; Canil, 2004) and represent spinels\nIn figure 4A, a comparison between MgO and Al2O3 (wt.%) of groundmass spinels shows that Mg-chromites have higher Al2O3 and MgO contents, while Mg-ulvospinels have lower Al2O3 and MgO contents. Figure 4B shows Ti/(Ti+Cr+Al) versus Fe2+/(Fe2+ + Mg) in molar fractions, and spinel trend 1 and trend 2 proposed by Mitchell (1986). Trend 1 represents spinels from Group I kimberlites with typically Mg-chromite zoned to Mg-ulvospinel. Trend 2 represents spinels from Group II kimberlites (orangeites) and also lamproites that contain Mg-chromite rarely zoned to Ti-magnetite, and do not present Mg-ulvospinels. Trend 2 is rare in kimberlites of Group I, but can be observed in varieties with macrocrystal mica Mitchell (1995). The Ros\u00e1rio do Sul spinels plot in the spinel trend 2. Mg-chromites have lower Ti/(Ti+Cr+Al) ratios, while Mg-ulvospinels have higher Ti/(Ti+Cr+Al) ratios. For comparison: spinels from Alto Parana\u00edba kimberlites and kamafugites (Melluso et al., 2008); and from kimberlites and a carbonatite from Arkhangelsk kimberlite province (Russia) (Beard et al., 2000).\nFig. 4: A. Al2O3 versus MgO wt.% and B. Ti/(Ti+Cr+Al) versus Fe2+/(Fe2+ + Mg) (molar\nfractions). Filled squares are Ros\u00e1rio do Sul Mg-chromites and open squares are Ros\u00e1rio do\nSul Mg-ulvospinels. Spinels from Alto Parana\u00edba kimberlites and kamafugites, and\nArkhangelsk Field are shown as in figure 3. Trend 1 represents spinels from Group I kimberlites, and trend 2 represents spinels from Group II kimberlites (orangeites) and also lamproites Mitchell (1986).\nTrace element compositions of Mg-chromites show V contents from 1042 to 1593 ppm, Ni contents from 694 to 7538 ppm, Ba contents from 15 to 1502 ppm, Rb contents from 2 to 32 ppm, Sr contents from 5.8 to 148 ppm, Zr contents from 33 to 176 ppm and Nb contents from 2 to 34 ppm. Mg-ulvospinels have V contents from 735 to 1725 ppm, Ni contents from 709 to 2221 ppm, Ba contents from 6 to 10263 ppm, Rb contents from 2 to 713 ppm, Sr contents from 12 to 1697 ppm, Zr contents from 135 to 723 ppm and Nb contents from 2 to 316 ppm (Table 2). Compared to Cr-Fe-Ti oxides of Alto Parana\u00edba kimberlites and kamafugites (Melluso et al., 2008), Ni, Ba, Rb, Sr, Zr and Nb contents are higher in Ros\u00e1rio do Sul Mg-chromites and Mg-ulvospinels, while only V contents are similar.\nPhlogopite\nPhlogopite occurs in Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite as microphenocrysts (<1.5 mm) (Fig. 1B, D and E) and in the groundmass (Fig. 1A, E and F), which is generally associated to melilite, calcite and the mesostasis. Phlogopite microphenocrysts have inclusions of CaTiO3-perokskite, Mg-chromite, Mg-ulvospinel and monticellite, and can be frequently altered to chlorite. Phlogopite also occurs as inclusions in the serpentinized olivine macrocryst rims and microphenocrysts, together with Mg-chromite and melt pockets.\nRos\u00e1rio do Sul phlogopites have SiO2 content from 37.5 to 42 wt.%, MgO from 20.8 to 24 wt.%, K2O from 9.5 to 10.4 wt.%, and FeO from 7 to 11 wt.%. Phlogopite microphenocrysts (Table 5) are enriched in TiO2 (from 1.6 to 2.9 wt.%) but have less Al2O3 contents (from 3.3 to 9.6 wt.%) compared to groundmass phlogopites, that have lower TiO2\ncontents (from 0.1 to 0.8 wt.%) and higher Al2O3 contents (from 12.2 to 16.6 wt.%). This variation can be related to the crystallization of CaTiO3-perovskite that consumed Ti and left less amount of this element available in the melt. This evolution trend is observed in the diagram of figure 5, together with phlogopites compositions from Alto Parana\u00edba kimberlites and kamafugites (Brazil) (Melluso et al., 2008), Arkhangelsk kimberlite province and a calciocarbonatite of Mela Field (Russia) (Beard et al., 2000); Jacupiranga complex carbonatites (Brazil) (Brod et al., 2001), and others Canadian and Russian kimberlites and carbonatites (Reguir et al., 2009). The same tetraferriphlogopite-phlogopite trend is observed in phlogopites from Alto Parana\u00edba kimberlites and kamafugites, and Arkhangelsk kimberlites. The main phlogopites from carbonatites (Mela Field, Jacupiranga complex and the ones from Canada and Russia) have equal or higher Al and Fe contents than phlogopites from Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlites.\n(n.o.a.)\tCAR3A(3)\tCA03D(7)\tCAR301(2)\tCAR3I(3)\tCAR3F(2)\tCAR3A(3)\tCA03D(3)\tCAR301(4) CAR3I(3)\t\tCAR-3A(3)\tCA-03D(4)\nSiO2\t42(1)\t40(1)\t37(1)\t40(3)\t37.5(0.6)\t0.01(0.03)\t0.06(0.03)\tn.d.\t0.05(0.02)\t0.7(0.9)\t0.5(0.4)\nTiO2\t2.1(0.8)\t1.1(0.9)\t0.2(0.1)\t1.3(0.7)\t0.5(0.1)\t56.3(0.4)\t55.4(0.3)\t56.9(0.4)\t55.3(0.4)\t0.02(0.01)\tn.d.\nAl2O3\t6(2)\t9(4)\t16.3(0.4)\t9(6)\t13.8(0.6)\t0.23(0.02)\t0.36(0.02)\t0.21(0.01)\t0.27(0.07)\t0.03(0.05)\t0.02(0.02)\nFeO*\t11(2)\t7(2)\t7.6(0.7)\t9.5(0.4)\t10.2(0.5)\t1.5(0.2)\t2.24(0.09)\t1.2(0.1)\t1.5(0.4)\t0.2(0.1)\t0.1(0.05)\nMnO\t0.11(0.03)\t0.1(0.1)\t0.21(0.04)\t0.2(0.2)\t0.36(0.03)\t0.02(0.02)\t0.04(0.02)\t0.01(0.01)\tn.d.\t0.03(0.02)\t0.01(0.03)\nMgO\t24(2)\t24(1)\t22.8(0.4)\t22(2)\t20.8(0.5)\t0.05(0.01)\t0.045(0.005)\t0.05(0.02)\t0.04(0.02)\t0.06(0.03)\t0.05(0.04)\nCaO\t0.12(0.05)\t0.14(0.06)\t0.18(0.05)\t0.06(0.04)\t0.20(0.09)\t38.5(0.8)\t38.0(0.2)\t37.9(0.4)\t39.5(0.3)\t53.2(0.6)\t51(3)\nNa2O\t0.5(0.2)\t0.3(0.3)\t0.04(0.04)\t0.5(0.5)\t0.10(0.05)\t0.27(0.02)\t0.22(0.03)\t0.24(0.05)\t0.27(0.07)\t0.03(0.03)\t0.4(0.5)\nK2O\t9.5(0.2)\t9.7(0.3)\t9.5(0.3)\t10.2(0.2)\t10.4(0.3)\t0.06(0.02)\t0.054(0.006)\t0.07(0.06)\t0.07(0.02)\t0.01(0.01)\t0.03(0.05)\nCr2O3\t0.09(0.05)\t0.04(0.04)\t0.03(0.05)\t0.02(0.02)\tn.d.\t0.10(0.03)\t0.04(0.05)\t0.09(0.09)\t0.09(0.08)\t0.01(0.02)\tn.d.\nP2O5\tn.d.\tn.d.\tn.d.\tn.d.\tn.d.\tn.d.\tn.d.\tn.d.\tn.d.\t40.3(0.9)\t39(2)\nTotal\t96.4\t93.1\t93.8\t92.3\t93.9\t97.1\t96.5\t96.7\t97.1\t94.7\t91.9\nCations per formula unit based on 22 (phlogopite), 12 (perovskite) and 24 (apatite) oxygens.\nSi\t6.215\t5.994\t5.403\t6.007\t5.611\t0.001\t0.006\t0.001\t0.005\t0.087\t0.114\nTi\t0.233\t0.128\t0.025\t0.151\t0.063\t3.971\t3.936\t4.015\t3.904\t0\t0.002\nAl\t0.970\t1.648\t2.835\t1.610\t2.438\t0.026\t0.041\t0.024\t0.030\t0.003\t0.001\nFe\t1.311\t0.918\t0.935\t1.212\t1.274\t0.115\t0.177\t0.097\t0.117\t0.021\t0.024\nMn\t0.014\t0.013\t0.026\t0.026\t0.046\t0.002\t0.003\t0.001\t0\t0.002\t0.004\nMg\t5.307\t5.360\t5.0\t4.954\t4.631\t0.007\t0.006\t0.007\t0.005\t0.012\t0.016\nCa\t0.019\t0.022\t0.028\t0.010\t0.033\t3.869\t3.849\t3.807\t3.975\t9.444\t9.495\nNa\t0.141\t0.095\t0.013\t0.144\t0.030\t0.048\t0.040\t0.043\t0.049\t0.138\t0.010\nK\t1.822\t1.835\t1.783\t1.983\t1.991\t0.007\t0.006\t0.008\t0.009\t0.007\t0.002\nCr\t0.011\t0.005\t0.004\t0.003\t0.001\t0.007\t0.003\t0.007\t0.007\t0\t0.001\nP\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0\t5.708\t5.688\nTotal\t16.04\t16.02\t16.05\t16.10\t16.12\t8.04\t8.06\t7.99\t8.10\t15.42\t15.36\nTable 5: Representative mineral compositions (wt.%) of phlogopite, CaTiO3-perovskite and apatite of the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite. *Total Fe reported as FeO.

The tetraferriphlogopite-phlogopite evolution trend shows an Al enrichment and Ti depletion of the phlogopite compositions. For comparison, phlogopites from Alto Parana\u00edba kimberlites and kamafugites are shown by open circles (Melluso et al., 2008); phlogopites from Arkhangelsk kimberlite province are shown by open downtriangles, and from the calciocarbonatite of Mela Field are gray circles (Beard et al., 2000); phlogopites from Jacupiranga complex carbonatites (Brazil) are filled circles (Brod et al., 2001), and phlogopites from Canadian and Russian kimberlites and carbonatites are open and filled stars, respectively (Reguir et al., 2009).\nFigure 6A shows the Ti depletion and Al enrichment of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul phlogopites, which is represented by the tetraferriphlogopite-phlogopite trend. This compositional\nvariation is also observed in phlogopites from other kimberlites and carbonatites. The\n2_|_\noctahedral sites of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul phlogopites are randomly occupied by Fe and Mg, and the tetrahedral sites are occupied by Si and Al, as the trend observed in figure 6B.\nFig. 6: A.

Symbols legend identical to figure 5.\nTrace element compositions of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul phlogopites (Table 2) have Rb contents from 4.6 to 1380 ppm, Sr contents from 4.1 to 1831 ppm, Zr contents from 37 to 5661 ppm and Ba contents from 342 to 21276 ppm. The chondrite normalized trace element compositions of the Ti-rich-Al-poor (microphenocrysts) (Fig.7A) and Ti-poor-Al-rich (groundmass) (Fig.7B) phlogopites of the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite show positive anomalies of Li, Rb, Sr, Zr, Nb, Ba and Ta, and negative anomalies of Ni, Y, Ho, Yb and Th. There is an enrichment in LREE (La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm and Eu) related to the HREE (Y, Gd, Ho and Yb).\nThe carbonatitic phlogopites from Canada and Russia (Reguir et al., 2009), and kimberlitic and kamafugitic phlogopites from Alto Parana\u00edba (Melluso et al., 2008) (Fig.7A and B) have spidergrams very similar to Ros\u00e1rio do Sul phlogopites, with positive anomalies of Rb, Sr, Zr, Nb, Ba and Ta, and negative anomalies of Ni and Y. Phlogopites from Alto Parana\u00edba kimberlites and kamafugites also show negative anomalies of HREE and Th.

In both figures, chondrite normalized trace element average of phlogopites\nfrom Alto Paranaiba (Brazil) kimberlites and kamafugites are shown by the light dashed line\n(Melluso et al., 2008); and chondrite normalized trace element average of phlogopites from\nCanadian and Russian carbonatites are shown by the strong dashed line (Reguir et al., 2009).\nFig. 8: Diagrams of Ba/Nb (A) and La/Sr (B) ratios versus TiO2/Al2O3 ratio of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul phlogopite microphenocrysts (filled triangles) and groundmass (open triangles): Ba and Sr contents decrease, while Nb and La contents increase with TiO2 depletion and Al2O3 enrichment of phlogopite compositions.\nCaTiO \u00a1-perovskite\nCaTiO3-perovskite is ubiquitous in Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite samples. They are small and euhedral (10 - 40 qm) (Fig. 1), and present a homogeneous chemical composition of around 55 wt.% TiO2 and 38 wt.% CaO, with very little solid solution (Table 5). Inclusions of olivine and Mg-chromite are very common. The total FeO contents display slight variation from 1.2 and 2.24 wt.% and may be indicative of formation under low oxygen fugacities Kimura and Muan (1971a and b).\nThe Ros\u00e1rio do Sul perovskite composition is essentially CaTiO3, without considerable substitution of Ca cations for Na + Ce and Sr + Ba cations in the dodecahedral site (Fig. 9A and B), but with substitution of Nb + Fe cations for Ti cation in the octahedral site (Fig. 9C).\nFig. 9: Diagrams comparing: (A) Na + Ce cations plotted against Ca cations; (B) Sr + Ba cations plotted against Ca cations; (C) Nb + Fe cations versus Ti cations of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul perovskites. The only substitution observed is Nb + Fe versus Ti cations in the octahedral site.\nThe Ros\u00e1rio do Sul CaTiO3-perovskites are the major REE mineral host, with Sr contents from 1883 to 5349 ppm, Nb contents from 2547 to 4283 ppm, Ba contents from 26\nto 8502 ppm, La contents from 1760 to 3364 ppm, Ce contents from 3027 to 7745 ppm and Nd contents from 1273 to 3349 ppm (Table 2). Ni contents range from 160 to 914 ppm, Rb contents range from 2.5 to 899 ppm, Zr contents range from 432 to 992 ppm, Pr contents range from 322 to 911 ppm and Th contents range from 112 to 930 ppm. In the chondrite-normalized trace element diagram (Fig. 10A), the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul perovskites plot with positive anomalies of Sr, Nb, La and Ta, and negative anomalies of Sc, Co, Ni, Ba and Yb. For comparison, perovskites data from the Lucapa I kimberlite (Angole) (Castillo-Oliver et al., 2016), and from the West Kimberley lamproite Ellendale 4 (Western Australia) (Jaques, 2016) are also plotted. The chondrite-normalized REE distribution pattern (Fig. 10B) shows an enrichment of REE contents compared to chondrite composition, and an enrichment of LREE contents compared to HREE contents, with La/Yb ratio ranging from 234 to 794, which reflects the high partition coefficient of LREE for CaTiO3-perovskite in silicate melts (Nagasawa et al., 1980). The diagram also shows this similar LREE enrichment in CaTiO3-perovskites from Udachnaya East (Russia), Chicken Park (Colorado) and Iron Mountain (Wyoming) hypabyssal kimberlites, and Grizzly pipe (Canada) (Chakhmouradian et al., 2013); and from a sovitic carbonatite perovskite from Badberg Kaiserstuhl (Germany) (Hornig-Kjarsgaard, 1998). Carbonatitic perovskites from Kola carbonatites (Russia) (Chakhmouradian and Mitchell, 1997) have higher Nb (from 43100 to 140200 ppm), La (from 5800 to 17700 ppm) and Ta (from 2700 to 9400 ppm) contents than Ros\u00e1rio do Sul perovskites.\nDuring the beginning of perovskite crystallization, the TiO2 content in the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul melt is higher, and the melt is richer in Sr and Ba contents (Fig. 11A and B) than during the late stages of perovskite crystallization, when the Al2O3 content increase with the depletion of Ti, and La and Ta contents also increase (Fig. 11C and D).\nFig. 10: A. Trace element compositions normalized to chondrite from McDonough &amp; Sun\n(1995): Ros\u00e1rio do Sul perovskites are the simple lines; perovskite from Lucapa I kimberlite\n(Angole) is the strong dashed line (Castillo-Oliver et al., 2016); and perovskite from West\nKimberley lamproite Ellendale 4 (Western Australia) is the light dashed line (Jaques, 2016).\nB. Chondrite-normalized REE distribution patterns for the most REE-enriched perovskite of\neach kimberlite. The bold line represents Ros\u00e1rio do Sul CaTiO3-perovskite composition.\nThe simple lines are from Udachnaya East, Chicken Park, Iron Mountain and Grizzly\nperovskites (data from Chakhmouradian et al., 2013); and the dashed line is from Badberg\nKaiserstuhl (Germany) mica sovite perovskite (data from Hornig-Kjarsgaard, 1998).\nTa (ppm)\tLa (ppm)\tBa (ppm)\tSr (ppm)\nFig. 11: Diagrams of Sr, Ba, La and Ta (ppm) versus TiO2 (wt.%) and Al2O3 (wt.%) of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul perovskites: the Sr and Ba contents (A and B) decrease, while the La and Ta contents (C and D) increase, with TiO2 depletion and Al2O3 enrichment of the melt.\nApatite\nApatite is present in the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite, as euhedral to subhedral microphenocrysts (Fig. 1C, D and F), varying in size from 20 to 150 |im, or in the groundmass, generally with irregular shape. The CaO and P2O5 contents of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul apatites range from 51 to 53 wt.% and from 39 to 40 wt.%, respectively. The microphenocrysts are commonly zoned, with Si and Na-enriched borders and P and Ca-enriched cores, while the groundmass apatites show corroded borders surrounded by ulvospinel and the mesostasis.\nThe trace-elements compositions of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul apatites show V contents from 619 to 4773 ppm, Sr contents from 8913 to 22168 ppm and Ba contents from 622 to 7684 ppm (Table 2). The apatite trace element distribution normalized to chondrite (Fig. 12A) show positive anomalies in V, Sr, Ba, and LREE. In the same diagram, Co, Ni, Nb and Ta have negative anomalies compared to chondrite. The apatite composition average from Belaya Zima carbonatite complex (Russia) (Doroshkevich et al., 2017) has a very similar trace element pattern (Fig. 12A). Figure 12B shows the REE content of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul apatites, compared to the average REE composition of apatites from Fen (Norway) and Jacupiranga (Brazil) carbonatites studied by Hornig-Kjarsgaard (1998), and REE composition of apatites from the Oka carbonatite complex (Quebec) (Eby, 1975). The REE contents of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul apatites are lower when compared to Fen, Jacupiranga and Oka carbonatitic apatites.\nFig. 12: A. Trace element compositions of apatites normalized to chondrite from\nMcDonough &amp; Sun (1995): simple lines are Ros\u00e1rio do Sul apatites; dashed line is the\naverage of apatites compositions from Russian carbonatites Doroshkevich et al., 2017; B.

In figures 13A-D, mesostasis is found percolating the olivine macrocrysts and microphenocrysts, the groundmass, and the pelletal lapilli components (Fig. 13C and D), which are widespread in the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul rocks and represent autholiths of previous crystalline components or liquid/gas pockets filled with an aphanitic material. The carbonate present is calcite, composed of 95 wt.% of CaO and with very low MgO and FeO concentrations, which corroborates the studies of Clement (1982) and Kobelski et al. (1979) that found calcite as the dominant carbonate present in kimberlites. The Ros\u00e1rio do Sul mesostasis is richer in Na than the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul mineral assemblage. This is evidenced by the occurrence of soda melilite, which is a mineral observed only in the mesostasis. This increase of the Na content in the residual kimberlitic liquid is due to this element remained in the melt and crystallizes together with the other minerals composing the mesostasis.\nFig. 13: Backscattered electron images of the thin sections from Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite.

(in prep.), and have higher trace element contents. Minerals as olivines, serpentines, monticellites and spinels have a minor influence on the trace element contents of the melt, except for V, Cr, Ni and Co elements. For calculations, we used the partition coefficient data between: phlogopite and kimberlitic (Fujimaki &amp; Tatsumoto, 1984) or lamprophyric melt (Foley et al., 1996); CaTiO3-perovskite and kimberlitic melt (Chakhmouradian et al., 2013); apatite and silicate melt (Prowatke &amp; Klemme, 2006). The calculated melt composition based on Ros\u00e1rio do Sul phlogopites, CaTiO3-perovskites and apatites trace element contents (Table 6 and Fig. 14), reflects important characteristics of the source of the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul melt as: high positive anomaly of Rb, Nb, Cs and Ba; moderately positive anomaly of Li, Sr, Zr, LREE, Hf, Ta, Th and U, and negative anomaly of V, Y, HREE and Pb. The Ros\u00e1rio do Sul source was probably enriched in elements as V, Cr, Ni and Co, however, these elements partition more easily in olivines, serpentines, monticellites and spinels crystals.\n\tCalculated Melt-phlo\tCalculated Melt-pv\tCalculated Melt-ap\nLi\t688(34)\tn.c.\tn.c.\nK\tn.c.\t46883(2344)\tn.c.\nTi\tn.c.\t17452(873)\tn.c.\nV\tn.c.\t326(16)\tn.c.\nRb\t166(8)\t221462(11073)\t3722(186)\nSr\t1229(61)\t1308(65)\t10069(503)\nY\t110(5)\t26(1)\t31(2)\nZr\t4131(206)\t615(31)\t894(45)\nNb\t384(19)\t222(11)\t4899(245)\nCs\t12(0.6)\tn.c.\t4147(207)\nBa\t2634(132)\t65436(3272)\t17823(891)\nLa\t291(15)\t112(6)\t92(5)\nCe\t539(27)\t191(10)\t107(5)\nPr\tn.c.\t17(0.9)\t9.5(0.5)\nNd\t314(16)\t58(3)\tn.c.\nSm\t66(3)\t10(0.5)\t5.5(0.3)\nEu\t31(2)\t3.8(0.2)\tn.c.\nGd\t98(5)\t9(0.5)\t6.9(0.3)\nTb\tn.c.\t1.4(0.1)\tn.c.\nDy\t43(2)\t5.8(0.3)\tn.c.\nHo\tn.c.\t0.84(0.04)\tn.c.\nEr\t25(1)\t2.1(0.4)\tn.c.\nTm\tn.c.\t0.29(0.01)\tn.c.\nYb\t13(0.7)\t1.9(0.1)\tn.c.\nLu\t1.5(0.1)\t0.2(0.1)\t0.28(0.01)\nHf\t68(3)\t15(1)\t30(2)\nTa\t7(0.4)\t3.8(0.2)\t63(3)\nPb\tn.c.\t0.80(0.04)\t2.2(0.1)\nTh\t85(4)\t3.7(0.2)\t4.9(0.2)\nU\tn.c.\t3.8(0.2)\t3.1(0.2)\nTable 6: Melt composition\nis calculated from trace\nelement compositions of phlogopite,\nCaTiO3-perovskite and apatite from this study, and partition coefficients of phlogopites from\nFoley et al.

Notes: n.c., not calculated; analytical uncertainties of 5%, as last significant digits given in brackets.\nFig. 14: A chondrite-normalized (values from McDonough &amp; Sun, 1995) trace element distribution pattterns for Ros\u00e1rio do Sul melt calculated based on phlogopite (grey circles), CaTiO3-perovskite (black circles), and apatite (white circles) partition coefficients and trace\nelement compositions.\nImplications for mantle composition\nAccording to Carniel et al. (submitted), Ros\u00e1rio do Sul crystallization temperatures registered by olivine-chromite at an estimated pressure of 3 GPa, are around 1573\u00b0C. The fO2 of coexisting olivine and CaTiO3-perovskite at this temperature is 0.6 log units more oxidized than the nickel-nickel oxide buffer (NNO buffer) at a silica activity limited by the crystallization of monticellite. These estimates suggest that the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite probably experienced oxidizing conditions during its ascent.\nV/Sc ratio in olivines can also be used to characterize oxidation state during melting based on the principle that these two elements have similar compatibilities, but only\nvanadium has two valence states, being less compatible in minerals under oxidizing conditions (Li and Lee, 2004; Lee et al., 2005 and Foley et al., 2011). According to a number of authors (Canil, 1997; Canil and Fedortchouk, 2001; Mallmann and O\u2019Neill, 2009; Foley et al., 2011; Foley et al., 2013), the low V/Sc of the olivines (V/Sc &lt;3) corresponds to peridotites or silicate melts that suffered metasomatic enrichment events, whereas high V/Sc ratios (V/Sc > 3) characterize the least modified peridotites or silicate melts. Figure 15 shows Ni content versus V/Sc ratio from olivines microphenocrysts of the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite. For comparison, olivines from Victor North Kimberlite olivines (Canada) and from orogenic peridotites (Norway) plot mainly in the oxidized area, whereas olivines from Kaalvallei kimberlite xenoliths (South Africa) (De Hoog et al., 2010) plot in the reduced area. The oxidizing characteristics of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul olivines, with V/Sc ratios lower than 3, probably reflects a metasomatic event of this melt during crystallization.\nFig. 15: Diagram Ni (ppm) versus V/Sc ratio (ppm) of olivines. The Ros\u00e1rio do Sul olivines microphenocrysts plotted as open circles in the oxidized field (Foley et al., 2013) limited by the dashed broken line. The metasomatized silicate melts have V/Sc ratios &lt;3 (high oxidation state), whereas least modified melts have V/Sc ratios > 3 (low oxidation state). The half filled circles are from Victor North Kimberlite olivines (Canada); the gray circles are from orogenic peridotites olivines (Norway); and the filled circles are from olivines of Kaalvallei kimberlite xenoliths (South Africa) (De Hoog et al., 2010).\nThe abundance of phlogopite and serpentinized olivines, in addition to low V/Sc ratios of olivine microphenocrysts of the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite, are indicative of a metasomatized source. The high Ti content of the minerals as Mg-ulvospinel, Mg-chromite, phlogopite and melilite, and the presence of CaTiO3-perovskite, suggest that the source of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite was Ti-enriched, however, after the consumption of Ti by CaTiO3-perovskite crystallization, the melt becomes Ti-depleted. This is confirmed by the Fe-Ti zonation in Mg-ulvospinel and melilite crystals, and the compositional variation of\nearly phlogopite microphenocrysts (high-Ti) and late groundmass phlogopite (low-Ti). CaTiO3-perovskites, together with monticellites, are the most homogeneous minerals, suggesting that they crystallized in the beginning of the kimberlite crystallization. Ros\u00e1rio do Sul monticellites could be resultant of olivine alteration or dissolution due to CO2 degassing, as proposed by Abersteiner et al. (in press). The olivine-serpentine-monticellitemelilite evolution trend, the phlogopite microphenocrysts and groundmass compositions, and the CaTiO3-perovskites compositions, indicate that the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul melt undergone a Ti-depletion and Al-enrichment process, which reflects a variation of magma composition. During the beginning of perovskite and phlogopite microphenocrysts crystallization, the TiO2 content in the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul melt is high, and the melt is probably richer in Rb, Sr and Ba contents. Throughout the late stages of perovskite crystallization and the beginning of groundmass phlogopite crystallization, the Ti content decreases and the Al content increases, followed by the increase of Nb, La and Ta contents, and the depletion of Rb, Sr and Ba.\nThe calcium carbonate present in the mesostasis, also indicates that the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul liquid was very rich in CO2. The Ros\u00e1rio do Sul mesostasis is richer in Na than the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul mineral assemblage, evidenced by the occurrence of soda melilite. This increase of the Na content in the residual kimberlitic liquid is due to this element remained in the melt and crystallizes together with the other minerals to compose the mesostasis.\nThe Ti-enrichment and the positive anomalies of Nb, Ce, Ta and U, suggest that Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite source was enriched by recycled oceanic crust that caused fertilization of mantle peridotite by melts derived from former basaltic crust and subducted carbonates (Litasov et al., 2013). The positive anomalies of Rb, Ba and Sr, the enrichment in LREE, and the negative anomalies of HREE in the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul minerals, are also indicatives of a metasomatism process in the mantle source that could be caused by fluids from recycled oceanic crust. The similarities between the trace element contents of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul spinels,\nphlogopites, CaTiO3-perovskites and apatites, and the trace element contents of these minerals in carbonatites - carbonatitic spinels and phlogopites from calciocarbonatite of Mela Field (Russia), Jacupiranga complex carbonatites (Brazil), and others Canadian and Russian carbonatites; carbonatitic perovskites from Kola carbonatites (Russia); and carbonatitic apatites from Belaya Zima carbonatite complex (Russia), Fen (Norway) and Jacupiranga (Brazil) carbonatites, and Oka carbonatite complex (Quebec) - contribute to support the hypothesis that Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite source was associated to a carbonatitic melt originated from a mantle metasomatized by CO2-rich fluids from recycled marine sediments.\nIn Ros\u00e1rio do Sul geological context, subducted slabs composed by carbonated sediments and basalts could be the responsible for oxidizing the mantle and producing carbonatitic and silicate magmas. This hypothesis is also proposed for the Paran\u00e1 flood basalts source (Rocha-J\u00fanior et al. 2012, 2013) and was experimentally proved by Gervasoni et al. (2017), who showed that the reaction of an ultramafic silicate-carbonate melt with peridotite, can produce Ca-rich carbonatite melt at lower temperature, or an alkali-rich carbonated silicate melt that is similar to Group I kimberlites, at higher temperature.\nBased on our results, we can predict that Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite source could be linked to the Paran\u00e1 flood basalts source and the Anit\u00e1polis alkaline-carbonatitic magmatism source. These occurrences are similar in age and could be product of a very similar mantle source and tectonic scenario. The alkaline events probably occurred in the early stages of the rifting, before and perhaps during the Africa - South America continental separation and during or just after the Paran\u00e1-Etendeka Igneous Province. The extension movements of the continental crust that produced the flood basalts, and events related to reorganization of continental plates during the rifting, could be responsible for triggered the alkaline-carbonatitic occurrences in the South of Brazil.\n6.\tConclusion\nThe Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite assemblage is composed of olivine, monticellite, melilite, Mg-chromite, Mg-ulvospinel, CaTiO3-perovskite, phlogopite and apatite. The high Ti content in Mg-chromite, Mg-ulvospinel, phlogopite and melilite, and the presence of CaTiO3-perovskite, suggest a Ti-rich source. CaTiO3-perovskites, together with monticellites, are the most homogeneous minerals, indicating that they crystallized in the beginning of the kimberlite crystallization. The olivine-serpentine-monticellite-melilite evolution trend, the phlogopite microphenocrysts and groundmass compositional variations, and the CaTiO3-perovskites compositions, indicate that the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul melt undergone an Al-enrichment process. With the crystallization process evolution (Ti-depletion and Al-enrichment), the trace element contents of Rb, Sr and Ba decrease, while Nb, La and Ta contents increase. The Ros\u00e1rio do Sul mesostasis is richer in Na and have calcium carbonate, indicating that the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul liquid was rich in CO2.\nThe calculated melt composition based on Ros\u00e1rio do Sul phlogopites, CaTiO3-perovskites and apatites trace element contents, shows high positive anomaly of Rb, Nb, Cs and Ba, however, the kimberlite source was probably also enriched in elements that partition more easily in olivines, serpentines, monticellites and spinels, as V, Cr, Ni and Co. The positive anomalies of Rb, Ba and Sr, the enrichment in LREE, and the negative anomalies of HREE in the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul minerals, and the positive anomalies of Nb, Ce, Ta and U, suggest a source that is product of a peridotite mantle enriched by recycled oceanic crust. The present study lead us to conclude that Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite was originated from a depleted mantle enriched and metasomatized by recycled slab material, that cause fertilization of this mantle by melts derived from basaltic crust and subducted carbonates.\nOur evidences propose a mantle heterogeneity caused by the melt of slab materials in the peridotite mantle that also produced the Paran\u00e1 flood basalts and other alkaline events that occurred concomitant to Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite eruption.\nAcknowledgments\nWe are very grateful to Beate Schmitte and Maik Trogisch from Universitat M\u00fcnster, for their assistance and contributions in the microprobe and ICP-MS samples preparation and analysis.

Crystallization temperatures, pressures and oxygen fugacities fO2) of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul and Alfeu-I kimberlite magmas are estimated using different methods from olivines, spinels, CaTiO3-perovskites, garnets, orthopyroxenes and clinopyroxenes compositions. Ros\u00e1rio do Sul crystallization temperatures registered by olivine-chromite geothermobarometer, are around 1556\u00b0C at a pressure of 2 GPa, and 1573\u00b0C at 3 GPa. The fO2 conditions at these temperatures are around 3.1 log units more oxidized than the NNO buffer, at a silica activity limited by the crystallization of monticellite (2 GPa and 3 GPa). Applying the new CaTiO3-perovskite oxygen barometer of Carniel et al. (submitted), we obtained less oxidized values of ANNO (1.2 at 2 GPa and 0.6 at 3 GPa). Alfeu-I kimberlite crystallization temperatures recorded by olivine-chromite geothermobarometer are around 1617\u00b0C at 4 GPa, and 1636\u00b0C at 5 GPa. The fO2 calculated\nfrom coexisting olivine and chromite at this temperature is ANNO 3.0 (4 GPa) and 3.2 (5 GPa). The Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite melt conditions can provide valuable information about the mantle conditions during the eruption of Paran\u00e1 flood basalts and the Gondwana breakup. The high fO2 conditions of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul and Alfeu-I kimberlites show that this mantle was very oxidized by slab materials from old subductions and denote their low potential to carry and preserve diamonds.\nKeywords: redox mantle conditions; kimberlite melts; CaTiO3-perovskite oxygen barometer; diamond preservation\n1.\tIntroduction\nThe estimations of pressure, temperature and redox conditions fO2) of a kimberlite magma source is very helpful to better understand the primary composition of a kimberlite melt formed in the mantle. This is a very complex study, considering the hybrid nature of the kimberlite rocks that are formed by minerals crystallized in the melt phase, but also xenoliths derived from the mantle and crust, in addition to high amounts of volatiles (CO2 and H2O). Nevertheless, the knowledge of such kimberlite conditions is very useful to better understand the mantle pressure, temperature and fO2 in a specific tectonic context, and also contributes to specify the possibility of occurrence and the quality of the diamonds that may be carried to the surface by these rocks.\nThe application of mineral thermobarometers and oxygen barometers in kimberlite rocks is permeated by difficulties regarding the low preservation grade of these rocks, that is usually the main obstacle, but also due to the diversified kimberlitic mineral assemblage, that sometimes do not contain all potential minerals required for such calculations.\nNonetheless, some kimberlitic primary magma can be partially represented by aphanitic kimberlites, such as Jericho, Canada (Price et al., 2000) and those from Kimberley, South Africa (Shee, 1986; Edgar et al., 1988; Edgar &amp; Charbonneau, 1993; Le Roex et al., 2003).\nIn order to determine the temperature, pressure and redox conditions of the mantle in the south of South America, we choose Ros\u00e1rio do Sul and Alfeu-I kimberlites, as the only kimberlites studied in this region. Ros\u00e1rio do Sul is a very well preserved hypabyssal kimberlite located in the southeastern edge of the Paran\u00e1 Basin, while Alfeu-I is an intrusive volcanic chimney which occurs in the southeastern portion of the Rio Grande do Sul Shield, South of Brazil. The geochemical, mineral chemistry and trace element data suggest that the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite is a transitional kimberlite very rich in Ti and CO2, which indicates that this kimberlite is the product of a silicate-carbonate liquid reaction in the mantle (Concei\u00e7\u00e3o et al., in prep.; Carniel et al., submitted). Despite the petrography and mineralogy of Alfeu-I be similar to Group II kimberlites, the mineral chemistry indicates transitional characteristics among Group I and II kimberlites and lamproites, which suggests similar petrogenesis of Alfeu-I and other potassic magmas without a strong affinity with a particular group (Provenzano, 2016).\nGeochronology determination was performed in Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite, based on U-Pb isotope ratios in perovskite, which resulted in ages of ~ 128 Ma (Concei\u00e7\u00e3o et al., in prep.), which indicates the eruption of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul just after the volcanism of Paran\u00e1-Etendeka Province (between 133 and 132 Ma; Renne et al., 1992, 1996; Turner et al., 1994; Ernesto et al., 2002) and very close to the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean, during Early Cretaceous (Piccirillo and Melfi, 1988; Hawkesworth et al., 1992).\nThe Gondwana breakup probably initiated in the mid-Jurassic, however, the exact timing is uncertain, considering that the oldest magnetic anomalies on South Atlantic\noceanic crust have associated ages from 131 and 126 Ma (Turner et al., 1994; N\u00fcrnberg and M\u00fcller, 1991). The Paran\u00e1 flood basalts are one of the most important events that occurred during the beginning of the South America and South Africa separation, and they provide significant information about the sub-continental mantle in the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite context. They are geochemically divided in low-Ti basalts and high-Ti basalts, the last with higher Fe, P, Ti, Zr, Ce, La, Ba and Sr concentrations. This compositional variation is interpreted by Bellieni et al. (1984) as an evidence of a large scale heterogeneous mantle source. In addition to previous studies (Peate et al., 1999; Marques et al., 1999) that proposed a heterogeneous lithospheric mantle melting as the source of the Paran\u00e1 flood basalts, Rocha-J\u00fanior et al. (2012, 2013) demonstrated, based on Re-Os and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic data, that the asthenospheric source of the basalts was enriched by fluids or magmas related to the Neoproterozoic subduction processes. The authors also suggest that a mantle plume (Tristan da Cunha) could have acted as a heat source that may triggered the Paran\u00e1 flood basalts generation, but without any role in the Paran\u00e1 flood basalt source.\nAccording to Concei\u00e7\u00e3o et al.(in prep.) and Carniel et al. (submitted), extensional movements that caused the Gondwana breakup and contributed to the eruption of Paran\u00e1 flood basalts that covered the Paran\u00e1 basin sediments, may have been also responsible for Ros\u00e1rio do Sul event. The carbonated material and basalts from subducted slabs may have oxidized the mantle and caused alkaline events as Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite, with similar age to the Paran\u00e1 basalts, in southern Brazil.\nIn this study, we estimated temperatures, pressures and fO2 conditions for Ros\u00e1rio do Sul and Alfeu-I kimberlites, applying different thermobarometers and oxygen barometers. We used our results to discuss the possibility of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite composition be a representative melt of a mantle contaminated by old subductions. Furthermore, our goal is to\nconstrain the potential of these kimberlites to carry and preserve diamonds, since no diamonds were found in both of them until today.\n2.\tSamples\nThe Ros\u00e1rio do Sul transitional kimberlite investigated in this study is a hypabyssal body from the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul Kimberlitic Province, embedded in Phanerozoic sandstones of the Piramboia formation in the Paran\u00e1 Basin, South of Brazil (Concei\u00e7\u00e3o et al., in prep.). Mineralogy and chemistry of minerals were well described in Carniel et al. (submitted). Olivine megacrysts from peridotite mantle xenoliths and pelletal lapilli are spread in the rock immersed in the heterogeneous and segregated matrix of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite. The Ros\u00e1rio do Sul mineral assemblage consists of macrocrysts and microphenocrysts of olivine, and microphenocrysts of phlogopite and apatite, all immersed in a groundmass composed of serpentinized olivine, monticellite, melilite, phlogopite, CaTiO3-perovskite, Mg-chromite, Mg-ulvospinel and apatite, in addition to a mesostasis composed of phlogopite, soda melilite, akermanite and carbonate (Concei\u00e7\u00e3o et al., in prep.). Olivine, spinel and perovskite compositions were used to determine the temperature and oxygen fugacity of the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul magma source (Table 1).\nThe Alfeu-I kimberlite is an intrusive volcanic chimney in Pinheiro Machado Suite of the Pelotas Batholith domain, and occurs in the eastern portion of the Rio Grande do Sul Shield in the South of Brazil, about 200 km far from Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite. According to Provenzano (2016), the Alfeu-I kimberlite has petrographic and mineralogical characteristics compatible with kimberlites from Group II, although the mineral chemistry interpretation indicates a transitional composition between Group I and II kimberlites, and lamproites. The Alfeu-I rocks are composed of megacrysts/macrocrysts and phenocrysts\n6 with different compositions (mica, spinel, garnet, ilmenite and pyroxene) in an interstitial matrix with some imbricated pelletal lapilli, rock autoliths and mantle xenoliths. The olivine, garnet, orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene compositions used in this study were acquired by Provenzano (2016), while spinel compositions are from Chaves et al. (2014) (Table 2).\nOlivines\t3A-21\t3A-30\t3A-37\t3D-55*\t3D-67\t3D-74\t3D-86\t3D-93\t3I-1-3*\t3I-1-4*\t3I-1-5*\t3I-1-6*\t3I-1-14*\t301-15*\t301-42\t301-43\t301-44\t301-63\nSiO2\t41\t42\t42\t45\t39\t40\t41\t40\t39\t39\t39\t39\t39\t41\t41\t40\t41\t41\nAl2O3\t0.005\t0\t0.01\t0.04\t0.01\t0.1\t0.01\t0.01\t1.9\t1.8\t2.2\t1.9\t2.0\t0.9\t0.05\t0.02\t0.02\t0.03\nFeO\t9.6\t8.8\t7.9\t5.4\t11\t10\t10\t11\t4.8\t4.9\t4.4\t4.6\t4.4\t5.8\t11\t10\t11\t10\nMgO\t50\t49\t49\t29\t49\t50\t49\t48\t35\t35\t36\t35\t36\t38\t49\t46\t48\t49\nCaO\t0.14\t0.26\t1.31\t1.6\t0.22\t0.11\t0.11\t0.69\t0.46\t0.55\t0.53\t0.65\t0.54\t0.53\t0.10\t0.32\t0.1\t0.13\nTiO2\t0.02\t0.02\t0.03\t0.01\t0.1\t0.04\t0\t0.04\t0.04\t0.03\t0.003\t0.1\t0.04\t0.02\t0.03\t0.05\t0\t0\nK2O\t0\t0.03\t0.01\t0.02\t0.01\t0.004\t0\t0.02\t0.02\t0.01\t0.002\t0.033\t0.01\t0.002\t0.02\t0.01\t0\t0\nNa2O\t0.03\t0.02\t0.01\t0.003\t0\t0.05\t0\t0.03\t0.01\t0.004\t0.01\t0.01\t0.02\t0.02\t0.002\t0.04\t0.005\t0.04\nCr2O3\t0.04\t0.1\t0.03\t0.05\t0.1\t0.02\t0.05\t0\t0.06\t0.05\t0.06\t0.03\t0.16\t0.01\t0.01\t0\t0.1\t0.1\nMnO\t0.15\t0.15\t0.28\t0.41\t0.16\t0.12\t0.14\t0.28\t0.18\t0.20\t0.16\t0.18\t0.17\t0.18\t0.15\t0.16\t0.11\t0.13\nTotal\t101\t101\t100\t81\t100\t100\t101\t100\t82\t82\t82\t81\t82\t86\t102\t98\t100\t101\nChromites\tR-3A-36\tR-3A-37\tR-3A-38\tR-3D-67\tR-3D-68\tR-3D-69\tR-3D-70\tR-3D-71\tR-3I-1-21\tR-3I-1-36\tR-3I-1-66\tR-3I-2-16\tR-3I-2-34\tR-301-27\nSiO2\t0.16\t0.16\t0.16\t0.17\t0.12\t0.15\t0.12\t0.15\t0.14\t0.15\t0.16\t0.12\t0.15\t0.16\nAl2O3\t18\t17\t18\t19\t19\t18\t19\t18\t20\t18\t19\t19\t17\t19\nFeO\t23\t24\t23\t20\t19\t23\t19\t24\t21\t23\t19\t19\t24\t19\nMgO\t13\t13\t12\t15\t15\t13\t15\t13\t14\t13\t14\t14\t13\t15\nCaO\t0.02\t0.01\t0.02\t0.06\t0.1\t0.02\t0.06\t0\t0.04\t0.02\t0.03\t0.04\t0.02\t0.14\nTiO2\t1.3\t1.2\t1.2\t1.7\t1.5\t1.1\t1.7\t1.1\t1.4\t1.3\t1.4\t1.6\t1.2\t1.5\nK2O\t0\t0.01\t0.01\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0.03\t0\t0.01\t0\t0\t0.03\t0.02\nNa2O\t0.04\t0.06\t0.06\t0.01\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0.03\t0.04\t0\t0.01\t0.003\t0.004\nCr2O3\t40\t40\t39\t44\t42\t40\t42\t39\t41\t40\t42\t43\t40\t43\nMnO\t0.4\t0.2\t0.2\t0.5\t0.5\t0.5\t0.5\t0.4\t0.4\t0.4\t0.4\t0.4\t0.5\t0.4\nTotal\t96\t96\t96\t100\t99\t96\t99\t96\t97\t96\t97\t98\t96\t99\nPvks\tR-3A-6\tR-3A-38\tR-3A-51\tR-3D-11\tR-3D-56\tR-3D-63\tR-3I-1-20\tR-3I-1-27\tR-3I-1-63\tR-3I-2-15\tR-3I-2-21\tR-301-28\tR-301-46\tR-301-47\tR-301-55\nSiO2\t0.05\t0\t0\t0.1\t0.03\t0.05\t0.04\t0.06\t0.1\t0.05\t0.1\t0\t0\t0.02\t0\nAI2O3\t0.2\t0.2\t0.2\t0.3\t0.4\t0.4\t0.22\t0.36\t0.36\t0.35\t0.23\t0.2\t0.2\t0.2\t0.2\nFeO\t1.3\t1.7\t1.4\t2.1\t2.3\t2.3\t1.2\t1.9\t2.1\t2.0\t1.3\t1.2\t1.2\t1.4\t1.1\nMgO\t0.04\t0.04\t0.06\t0.05\t0.05\t0.04\t0.02\t0.04\t0.03\t0.06\t0.03\t0.04\t0.03\t0.1\t0.05\nCaO\t39\t38\t38\t38\t38\t38\t40\t39\t39\t39\t39\t38\t38\t37\t38\nTiO2\t56\t57\t57\t56\t55\t55\t55\t55\t55\t55\t56\t57\t57\t57\t57\nK2O\t0.03\t0.1\t0.06\t0.06\t0.06\t0.05\t0.05\t0.1\t0.05\t0.1\t0.1\t0.01\t0.03\t0.14\t0.1\nNa2O\t0.3\t0.3\t0.3\t0.2\t0.2\t0.2\t0.3\t0.3\t0.2\t0.2\t0.3\t0.17\t0.24\t0.29\t0.25\nCrjOa\t0.06\t0.1\t0.1\t0\t0.1\t0.02\t0.2\t0.01\t0.02\t0.05\t0.05\t0.23\t0.05\t0.05\t0.03\nMnO\t0.002\t0.05\t0.01\t0.06\t0.02\t0.04\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0.02\t0\t0.03\t0.01\nTotal\t97\t97\t97\t97\t96\t97\t97\t97\t97\t97\t97\t98\t96\t96\t97\nTable 1: Ros\u00e1rio do Sul olivines, chromites and perovskites compositions used in calculations; (*) are serpentinized olivine microphenocrysts.\nMineral data are from Carniel et al.

(2014) and Provenzano (2016).\n3.\tMethods\nThe determination of the crystallization temperatures and oxygen fugacities (fO2) of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite was made using the olivine-spinel oxygen geothermobarometer of O\u2019Neill &amp; Wall (1987) and Ballhaus et al., (1991), which is applicable to the entire spectrum of spinel compositions occurring in mantle rocks and mantle-derived melts, and gives reasonable results to temperatures as low as 800\u00b0C. The CaTiO3-perovskite oxygen barometer of Carniel et al., (submitted) was also used in Ros\u00e1rio do Sul samples, in order to predict the redox conditions of the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul parental melt. In this method, the Fe content and modes of perovskites and olivines are used as an important tool to estimate the redox conditions of the kimberlite rocks. The pv-ol oxygen barometer equation can be applied in kimberlite rocks that contain perovskite and olivine from different fO2 conditions. Fe /Fe ratio of the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlitic melt was calculated using Fe /Fe (melt) equation from Carniel et al., (submitted), to better understand the oxidation state of the magma source and the consequent preservation of diamonds.\nThe determination of crystallization temperature and fO2 of Alfeu-I kimberlite was made using the same olivine-spinel oxygen geothermobarometer used in Ros\u00e1rio do Sul samples, from O\u2019Neill &amp; Wall (1987) and Ballhaus et al., (1991), since there is neither perovskite nor monticellite in Alfeu-I kimberlite mineral assembly. The temperatures and pressures of Alfeu-I kimberlite were also estimated with the orthopyroxene-clinopyroxene geothermometer of Wells (1977), and the garnet-orthopyroxene geothermobarometer of Nickel and Green (1985), respectively. Wells (1977) developed a semi-empirical equation of state extracted from the available experimental data for the diopside-enstatite miscibility gap. This equation\n4.\tGeothermometry and oxygen barometry results\n4.1. Olivine-spinel geothermobarometer and oxygen barometer\nTemperatures of the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul and Alfeu-I kimberlites were determined applying the olivine-spinel FeMg-1 exchange thermometer of equation (1) from O\u2019Neill &amp; Wall (1987) improved by Ballhaus et al. (1991):\nT = (6530 + 280P + 700 + 108P) * (1 - 2X\u00a3') - I960 * (X\u201epg - X^) + 16150 * X^ + 25150 * (X;pe3++X;p)/(R ln KM\"' 'P' +4.705)\t(1)\nwhere T is in K, X\u00a3' are the number of Fe cations in olivine, , X'P 2+ , X'P , X'P3+ and X'P are the number of Mg, Fe2+, Cr, Fe3+ and Ti cations in spinel calculated based on 4 oxygens, KMg SP' is the ratio (XMg * X'p2+)/(Xpe * (X'spg). For calculations, we used chromites and olivines analyses of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul (Carniel et al., submitted) and Alfeu-I (Chaves et al., 2014; Provenzano, 2016) kimberlites. Fe and Fe contents of chromites were\nTemperatures were calculated in different pressures: 2 and 3 GPa for Ros\u00e1rio do Sul, based on silica activity limit constrained by the presence of monticellite (Edgar et al., 1988), and 4 and 5 GPa for Alfeu-I. Based on these calculations, the estimated mean temperature of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite source is 1556(\u00b160)\u00b0C at 2 GPa, and 1573(\u00b160)\u00b0C at 3 GPa (Table 3), whereas Alfeu-I kimberlite source is 1617(\u00b162)\u00b0C at 4 GPa and 1636(\u00b163)\u00b0C at 5GPa (Table 4). The Alfeu-I mineral assembly suggests a crystallization pressure higher than the pressure of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul, which was later proved by garnet-orthopyroxene geothermobarometer.\nThe oxygen barometer developed by Ballhaus et al., (1991) from equation (2) can be applied to a variety of mantle-derived rocks and spinel-bearing primitive melts. However, the equation is only valid if silica activity (aSiO2) is buffered by the presence of both olivine and orthopyroxene:\nAlog'(fO2)FMQ = 0.27 + 2505/T - 400P/T - 6log(X\u00a3i) - 3200(1 - X&amp;)2/T + 2log(Xsp2+) +\n4log(XFPe3+) + 2630(XAP )2 /T\n(2)\nThe silica activity (aSiO2) of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite is lower than that required to stabilize orthopyroxene. In this case, the Ballhaus et al., (1991) barometer can be used if a correction (equation 3) is applied:\nA log(/O2) FMQ = A log(/O2) FMQ (calculated) + 3 * (log\t_ log as\u00a1o2En buffer )\n(3)\nApplying the corrected fO2 values from equation (2) and (3), the calculated mean of oxygen fugacity relative to the nickel-nickel oxide (ANNO) of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlitic melt at 2 GPa and 3 GPa is 3.1(\u00b10.2) and 3.2(\u00b10.2), respectivelly. These values represent the average of fresh olivine macrocrysts cores. Considering the serpentinized olivine macrocrysts rims and olivine microphenocrysts, the results are slightly higher, with 3.8(\u00b10.3) at 2 GPa and 3.9(\u00b10.3) at 3 GPa (Table 3).

(submitted) as a perovskite oxygen barometer:\nANNO = - 0.648 x Fe(ol) + 0.591 x Fe(pv) - 0.036 x n(ol) - 0.023 x n(pv) + 0.006 x T - 0.767 x P\n(4) where Fe(ol) is the total Fe in olivine (Fe2+), Fe(pv) is the total iron in perovskite (Fe3+), n(ol) is the modal quantity of olivine, n(pv) is the modal quantity of perovskite, T is temperature (\u00b0C) and P is pressure (GPa).\nThe product of the equation (4) for Ros\u00e1rio do Sul melt is ANNO (mean) = 1.2 (\u00b10.6) at 2 GPa and ANNO (mean) = 0.6 (\u00b10.6) at 3 GPa. These results are based on fresh olivine macrocrysts cores data. The mean of oxygen fugacities based on serpentinized olivine macrocrysts rims and serpentinized olivine microphenocrysts, are significantly higher (ANNO = 4.1 \u00b10.4 at 2 GPa and ANNO = 3.5 \u00b10.4 at 3 GPa).\nAnother important source of information on oxidation states is the ferric/ferrous iron ratio 3+\nin the melt, which can be calculated from the amount of Fe in perovskite (Fe3+) and in olivine (Fe ). The following equation from Carniel et al., (submitted) considers that perovskite mainly concentrates Fe3+, while olivine concentrates mainly Fe2+:\nFe3+\nFe2+\n(melt) =\nFe3+(pv ^Dcme^)\nFe2+(ol )*D(mPVr)\n(5)\n2_|_\nwhere ol is olivine, pv is perovskite, D(ol/melt) is the distribution coefficient of Fe between olivine and melt, and D(pv/melt) is the distribution coefficient of Fe between perovskite and melt. D(ol/melt) and D(pv/melt) (Table 5) were calculated from the molar fractions of Fe in perovskites, olivines and in the bulk rock from Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite (Concei\u00e7\u00e3o et al., in prep.). The average of Fe /Fe ratio of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite melt is 0.69 using fresh olivines and 0.89 using serpentinized olivines for calculation, indicating that there is higher Fe3+ content in the melt after serpentinization. The Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio average of 0.76 (Table 5) suggest that Ros\u00e1rio do Sul melt may have undergone some oxidation process, increasing the Fe3+ content in the melt.\nSample\t\tFeO (wt. %)\tD(pv/melt)\tD(ol/melt)\tFe3+/Fe2+ ratio\tOl-pv ANNO\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2 GPa\t\t3 GPa\t\nOl\tR-3A-21\t1.34\t0.13\t0.65\t0.70\t1.2\t\t0.6\t\nPv\tR-3A-6\t9.62\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOl\tR-3A-30\t1.67\t0.16\t0.59\t0.69\t1.9\t\t1.2\t\nPv\tR-3A-38\t8.75\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOl\tR-3A-37\t1.38\t0.14\t0.53\t0.69\t2.1\t\t1.4\t\nPv\tR-3A-51\t7.88\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOl\tR-3D-74\t2.14\t0.21\t0.66\t0.69\t1.7\t\t1.0\t\nPv\tR-3D-11\t9.71\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOl\tR-3D-86\t2.31\t0.23\t0.69\t0.69\t1.5\t\t0.9\t\nPv\tR-3D-56\t10.2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOl\tR-3D-93\t2.28\t0.22\t0.76\t0.70\t1.2\t\t0.5\t\nPv\tR-3D-63\t11.0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOl\tR-3I-1-3*\t1.20\t0.12\t0.41\t0.88\t3.7*\t\t3.1*\t\nPv\tR-3I-1-20\t4.84\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOl\tR-3I-1-4*\t1.94\t0.19\t0.42\t0.88\t4.1*\t\t3.4*\t\nPv\tR-3I-1-27\t4.89\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOl\tR-3I-1-5*\t2.12\t0.21\t0.38\t0.88\t4.6*\t\t4.0*\t\nPv\tR-3I-1-63\t4.44\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOl\tR-3I-1-6*\t1.95\t0.19\t0.40\t0.89\t4.5*\t\t3.8*\t\nPv\tR-3I-2-15\t4.6\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOl\tR-3I-1-14*\t1.32\t0.13\t0.41\t0.96\t3.8*\t\t3.1*\t\nPv\tR-3I-2-21\t4.38\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOl\tR-301-42\t1.18\t0.12\t0.74\t0.69\t0.4\t\t-0.3\t\nPv\tR-301-28\t10.9\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOl\tR-301-43\t1.24\t0.12\t0.73\t0.71\t0.81\t\t0.2\t\nPv\tR-301-46\t10.4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOl\tR-301-44\t1.4\t0.14\t0.76\t0.69\t0.45\t\t-0.2\t\nPv\tR-301-47\t11.1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOl\tR-301-63\t1.10\t0.11\t0.67\t0.69\t1.1\t\t0.4\t\nPv\tR-301-55\t9.83\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMean\t\t\t\t\t\t1.2\t4.1*\t0.6\t3.5*\n(stdev)\t\t\t\t\t\t(0.6)\t(0.4)\t(0.6)\t(0.4)\n3+\t2+\nTable 5: Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite oxygen fugacities and Fe /Fe ratio in the melt calculated based on CaTiO3-perovskite oxygen barometer and Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio in the melt of Carniel et al., (submitted).

Based on olivine compositions (Fig. 1A and B), the fO2 increasing of the kimberlite melt is followed by the serpentinization process, with the Fe decreasing and Al increasing in serpentinized olivines. Fresh olivines crystallized at lower fO2 and have higher Fe content and lower Al content than serpentinized olivines. Figure 2 shows the effects of fO2 of the kimberlite melt in CaTiO3-perovskite compositional variation. Perovskites that crystallized at higher fO2 have higher CaO/TiO2 ratio than perovskites that crystallized at lower fO2. The correlation between the fO2 variations of the kimberlite melt and the compositional variations of the minerals confirms that the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite melt undergone a Ti depletion, Al enrichment and fO2 increasing during the evolution of its crystallization, which is also observed in the major element patterns of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul minerals. Trace element contents (Sr, Nb, Ce and Ta) from Carniel et al. (submitted) compared to ANNO (Fig. 3), show that fO2 increasing follows Ce and Ta, but not Sr and Nb concentrations.\nFig. 1: Diagrams of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul olivines compositions: A.

Trace element data from Carniel et al. (submitted). Note: f\u00dc2 results were calculated using perovskites and serpentinized olivine microphenocrysts; open symbols are the results at 2 GPa, and filled symbols at 3 GPa.\nThe average of Fe /Fe ratio of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite indicates that there was higher 3+\nFe content in the melt during the serpentinization. This could be explained by a H2\u00dc-rich\n2+ fluid that percolates the magma, causing hydration of olivine and the partial oxidation of Fe to Fe3+ (e.g. Evans et al., 2013). The Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio of the melt versus oxygen fugacity (ANN\u00dc) are plotted in figure 4. Calculations using CaTi\u00dc3-perovskite and fresh olivine\n3+\t'2\u00e1\nmegacryst cores compositions resulted in a lower Fe /Fe ratio in the melt and lower oxygen fugacity than the calculations using CaTiO3-perovskite and serpentinized olivine megacrysts\n3+ rims and microphenocrysts compositions. This pattern occurs due to the increasing of the Fe content in the melt with the increasing of fO2 in the system, which is affected by olivine serpentinization. Such a melt oxidation process can be caused by H2O-rich fluids from the kimberlite melt source, that are probably related to slab materials from subduction processes, in accordance with what has been suggested by Rocha-J\u00fanior et al. (2012, 2013) for the Paran\u00e1 flood basalts source. The carbonated material and basalts may have enriched and oxidized the mantle, causing alkaline events as Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite.\nI\tI\nANNO\nFig. 4: The diagram shows a comparison between Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio of the melt and the oxygen fugacity (ANNO). Notes: open symbols are from ANNO calculations based on estimated\nThe Paran\u00e1 flood basalts fO2 conditions are representative of the mantle redox conditions in this region. As the most expressive event that occurs during the Gondwana breakup, its redox conditions may contribute to evaluate how oxidized is the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite compared to the mantle source. The fO2 of Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite is significantly higher than the fO2 of the Paran\u00e1 flood basalts, described by Bellieni et al. (1984) (Fig. 5). The authors determined the fO2 of the Serra Geral basalts based on ilmenites and Ti-magnetites compositions, using the method of Buddington and Lindsley (1964). They found that high-Ti basalts, that have fO2 values close to NNO-QFM buffers (NNO - nickel-nickel oxide; QFM -quartz-fayalite-magnetite), are slightly more oxidized than the low-Ti basalts, with fO2 values close to QFM-WM buffers (QFM - quartz-fayalite-magnetite; WM - w\u00fcstite- magnetite). Ros\u00e1rio do Sul and high-Ti basalts fO2 conditions are closer, which can be correlated to the Ti-enrichment and the source depth of these rocks. High-Ti basalts have been derived from greater depths (90 - 120 km depth), with lower degree of melting than the low-Ti basalts (30 -60 km depth) (Garland et al., 1996).\nFig. 5: Diagram of log/O2 versus temperature (\u00b0C) with Ros\u00e1rio do Sul results (triangles); high-Ti Serra Geral basalts (filled circles); and low-Ti Serra Geral basalts (open circles) (Bellieni et al., 1984). Buffers: NNO (nickel-nickel oxide); QFM (quartz-fayalite-magnetite); WM (w\u00fcstite-magnetite). All buffer curves and results at 0.2 GPa.\n5.2. Application to diamond preservation\nThe Ros\u00e1rio do Sul results indicate that this kimberlite crystallized at low pressures (from 2 to 3 GPa, which represents 60-90km depth), high temperatures (from 1556\u00b0C to 1573\u00b0C), and at ANNO = 1.2 - 3.1, while Alfeu-I kimberlite crystallized deeper in the mantle (from 4 to 5 GPa, around 120-150km depth), at higher temperatures (from 1617\u00b0C to 1636\u00b0C), and at ANNO = 3.0 - 3.2. Both kimberlite melts crystallized at high oxygen fugacities, with CO2-rich mantle fluids that act as metasomatic agents in the kimberlite melt.\nThe Ros\u00e1rio do Sul and Alfeu-I temperatures and fO2 are plotted in the diagrams of figure 6 (Ros\u00e1rio do Sul) and figure 7 (Alfeu-I), where: D/GCO is the diamond/graphite-carbon oxide buffer from Frost &amp; Wood (1997); EMOD/G is the enstatite-magnesite-olivine-diamond/graphite buffer from Zhao et al. (1999); and NNO is the nickel-nickel oxide buffer from Ballhaus et al. (1991). All buffer curves at 2 GPa and 3 GPa. The GCO and DCO oxygen buffers describe the upper fO2 stability of graphite or diamond with respect to a free C-O fluid (Frost &amp; Wood, 1997). The EMOD/G curve defines the stability field between diamond/graphite and magnesite (MgCO3) in the mantle. Considering this, the area below to this curve represents the oxygen fugacity for melts in equilibrium with diamond or graphite.\nRos\u00e1rio do Sul oxygen fugacity plots above the graphite stability area (Fig. 6), but some results at 3 GPa plot very close to the graphite stability curve. In the field of CO2, fluids with CO2 may react with mantle silicates to produce carbonate-rich melts.\nFig. 6: Diagrams comparing logfO2 and temperature (\u00b0C) with Ros\u00e1rio do Sul plots (filled triangles). D/GCO is the diamond/graphite-carbon oxide buffer at 2 and 3 GPa from Frost &amp; Wood (1997). EMOD/G is the enstatite-magnesite-olivine-diamond/graphite buffer at 2 and 3\nGPa from Zhao et al. (1999). NNO is the nickel-nickel oxide buffer at 2 and 3 GPa from Ballhaus et al. (1991).\nAlfeu oxygen fugacity plots above the graphite stability curve (Fig. 7). At the fO2 of Alfeu-I kimberlite, carbon can be oxidized to produce carbonate melt through the reduction of Fe in silicate minerals during upwelling (Stagno et al., 2013). From 4 to 5 GPa (from 120 to 150 km depth), diamonds can survive but at very low oxygen fugacities and temperatures (see D/G limit of figure 7). For comparison, we also plotted the Lac de Gras kimberlites (Canada) data from Fedortchouk and Canil (2004). According the authors, the T-fO2 values obtained from Lac de Gras diamondiferous kimberlites show that the diamonds of these kimberlites ascended in the stability field of graphite.\nFig. 7: Stability fields of graphite and CO2 in logfO2 versus temperature (\u00b0C) diagram at 4 GPa. D/GCO buffer from Frost &amp; Wood (1997); EMOD/G buffer from Zhao et al. (1999); and NNO buffer from Ballhaus et al. (1991). D/G (diamond/graphite) limit is from Kennedy and Kennedy (1976). Alfeu-I results are plotted as filled circles (using temperatures calculated from Ballhaus et al., 1991) and open circles (using temperatures calculated from Wells, 1977).\nLac de Gras kimberlites data are crosses (Fedortchouk and Canil, 2004). All buffer curves limit and results at 4 and 5 GPa.\nCanil and Bellis (2007), based on kimberlite samples from Lac de Gras area (Canada), shown that, estimates of kimberlite fO2 may be useful in predicting the quality or properties of their diamonds, considering that the kimberlite pipe with the highest fO2 has the highest proportion of highly resorbed diamonds, whereas pipes with lower estimated fO2 have lower proportions of highly resorbed diamonds. Figure 8 shows a comparison between our fO2 results for Ros\u00e1rio do Sul and Alfeu-I kimberlites, and other fO2 results for the cratonic mantle lithosphere, other mantle derived magmas, diamondiferous kimberlites (Lac de Gras, Somerset Island and Dutoitspan kimberlites), kimberlites with low diamond potential (NKF kimberlites), and the Paran\u00e1 flood basalts. Considering that fO2 affects the properties and textures of diamonds preserved in the magma, we demonstrated that the high fO2 of the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul and Alfeu-I kimberlite melts increases the possibility that the diamonds may have been partially or completely dissolved in the way to the surface.\nI____________________________I Cratonic Mantle\nWMexico r Lamprophyre/Minette |\t|\nL- I\tI Basalt/Andesite\nKilauea |\t|\nMORB I\tI\nI\tI Kimberlites worldwide\nLac de Gras (Canada) |\t|\nI\tI Somerset Island (Canada)\nI\t\u2014I Dutoitspan kimberlites (Southern Africa)\n__________ NKF kimberlites (India)\nI\tI Paran\u00e1 flood basalts (Brazil)\nRos\u00e1rio do Sul (this study) |\t|\nAlfeu-I (this study) |i\nI 1 I I I I I I I I I\n-6\t-5\t-4\t-3\t-2\t-1\t0\t1\t2\t3\t4\t5\t6\nANNO\nFig. 8: Oxygen fugacity (ANNO) conditions of the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul and Alfeu kimberlites, compared to fO2 from cratonic mantle lithosphere (Woodland and Koch, 2003; McCammon and Kopylova, 2004); mantle-derived magmas (Carmichael and Ghiorso, 1986; Christie et al., 1986; Carmichael, 1991); Lac de Gras and Somerset Island kimberlites (Canada) (Canil and Bellis, 2007); Dutoitspan kimberlite (South Africa) (Ogilvie-Harris et al., 2009); Narayanpet Kimberlite Field - NKF (India) (Chalapathi Rao et al., 2011); and Paran\u00e1 flood basalts (Brazil) (Bellieni et al., 1984).

The fO2 conditions at this temperature are around 3.1 log units more oxidized than the NNO buffer, at a silica activity limited by the crystallization of monticellite (2 GPa and 3 GPa). Calculations from the CaTiO3-perovskite oxygen barometer resulted in less oxidized values of ANNO (1.2 at 2 GPa and 0.6 at 3 GPa) than the previous method. The results of both methods indicate that Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite melt may have suffered some oxidation process, which also increased the Fe content in the melt. Alfeu-I kimberlite crystallization temperatures recorded by olivine-chromite geothermobarometer are around 1617\u00b0C at 4 GPa, and 1636\u00b0C at 5 GPa. The fO2 calculated from coexisting olivine and chromite at this temperature is ANNO 3.0 (4 GPa) and 3.2 (5 GPa). The serpentinization process that occurs in Ros\u00e1rio do Sul olivines, covering olivine macrocrysts rims and olivine microphenocrysts, is due to H2O-rich fluids from subducted slab materials which also increase the fO2 of the melt. The origin of these hydrated and carbonated fluids or magmas that caused such a melt oxidation process in Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite could be related to subducted slab materials from old subduction processes in the kimberlite mantle source. In this geological context, an old oceanic plate would have subducted carbonated and hydrated materials, in addition to basalts, that may have enriched and oxidized the mantle beneath the South American platform, being a potential source for the Paran\u00e1 flood basalts and alkaline events as Ros\u00e1rio do Sul kimberlite, during the Gondwana breakup. The high fO2 conditions of the Ros\u00e1rio do Sul and Alfeu-I kimberlite melts also indicates that the diamonds that could have been carried by these kimberlites, undergone partial or complete dissolution in the way to the surface.\nAknowledgments\nReferences\nBallhaus, C., Berry, R.F. and Green, D.H.
