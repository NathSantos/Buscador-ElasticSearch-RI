Foram \n\nsintetizados dois p\u00f3s, ?-TCP e ?BTCP (bif\u00e1sico, ?-TCP + ?-TCP). Partindo \n\ndestes p\u00f3s, foram preparadas pastas ciment\u00edcias na aus\u00eancia e na presen\u00e7a de \n\nf\u00e1rmaco, variando a raz\u00e3o l\u00edquido/p\u00f3 e caracterizadas em termos de tempos de \n\npresa inicial e final, par\u00e2metros importantes para o enchimento e desmoldagem \n\ndos componentes. Os cimentos resultantes foram caracterizados em termos de \n\nporosidade, fases cristalinas, resist\u00eancia mec\u00e2nica, microestrutura da superf\u00edcie \n\ne metodologia de secagem. As formula\u00e7\u00f5es de cimento que apresentaram os \n\nresultados mais promissores para o fabrico de MN foram utilizadas para estudar \n\na taxa de liberta\u00e7\u00e3o do f\u00e1rmaco.

O \n\nantibi\u00f3tico levofloxacina (LEV) foi utilizado como f\u00e1rmaco modelo.  \n\nOs resultados obtidos mostraram que a adi\u00e7\u00e3o de LEV aumenta os tempos de \n\npresa iniciais e finais das pastas ciment\u00edcias e diminui as propriedades \n\nmec\u00e2nicas dos cimentos.

Das v\u00e1rias agulhas testadas, os valores da for\u00e7a necess\u00e1ria \n\npara quebrar a ponta situam-se num intervalo de 57 a 110 N.  \n\nAs MN \u00e0 base de cimentos de TCP apresentam caracter\u00edsticas adequadas para \n\nserem utilizadas como meio de administra\u00e7\u00e3o de f\u00e1rmacos via transd\u00e9rmica com \n\nfuturo em diversas aplica\u00e7\u00f5es m\u00e9dicas.

From metals to polymers, \n\nmicroneedles have been fabricated with a high variety of materials, although with \n\nsome constraints regarding mechanical strength (limitations related to skin \n\nperforation), storage and high manufacturing costs.  \n\nIn the present thesis, self-setting bioceramics were used to fabricate brushitic\n\nand apatitic MN by micro-molding casting. Two precursor powders were \n\nsynthesized to obtain ?-TCP and BTCP (biphasic,??-TCP+?-TCP) as main \n\nphases. Cement pastes were prepared in absence and in presence of drug, \n\nvarying liquid to powder ratio and characterized in terms of initial and final setting \n\ntimes, important parameters for casting and de-molding procedures. The\n\nresulting cements were characterized for their porosity, crystalline phases, \n\nmechanical strength, surface morphology and drying methodology. The cement \n\nformulations that presented the most promising results for MN fabrication\n\n(flowability during casting and adequate mechanical properties for de-molding \n\nwithout damage) were used to study drug release rate. A citric acid solution with \n\nadequate concentration was the most suitable as setting liquid in both MN types. \n\nThe antibiotic levofloxacin was used as a model drug.  \n\nThe results show that the addition of levofloxacin increases the setting times of \n\nthe cement pastes and decreases the mechanical properties of the cements. A \n\n100% drug release was achieved for all the tested cement formulations after 48\n\nhours of immersion time. The drug release kinetics were evaluated being \n\ndetermined that the \"coupled mechanism\" is the one that best described the \n\nrelease mechanism of cements obtained from both powders. Sharp MN were \n\nsuccessfully casted and de-molded. MN tip obtained in this work present \n\nadequate mechanical properties for skin perforation without breakage, since \n\naccording to literature the insertion forces necessary for perforate human skin is\n\naround 1-5 N. Among all tested MN, the force necessary to break the tip is in the \n\nrange 57 to 110 N.   \n\nFrom the evaluated work, calcium phosphate cement based MN present \n\nadequate characteristics to be used as a promising drug delivery\n\nmicrocomponent for biomedical applications. The fabrication process used \n\n(micromolding) has several advantages when compared to the current \n\nproduction MN processes being simple, cost-effective and replicable.  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\ni \n \n\nIndex \n\n \n\nIndex ............................................................................................................................. i \n\nFigure Index ................................................................................................................ iv \n\nTable index ................................................................................................................. vii \n\nAbbreviations and acronyms index............................................................................. viii \n\nBackground and context ................................................................................................ 1 \n\n1.

The way how such \n\ntreatments are applied is of major importance and directly affects the body\u2019s response, \n\neither positively or negatively. As so, the interest in discovering new ways to deliver \n\nchemicals as grown alongside the advances in drug discovery. The effectiveness of a drug \n\nand how it behaves in the body is directly related to the way it is delivered. \n\nTraditionally, medicines (meaning drugs) are delivered to the body via one of  two \n\nmajor forms: orally, with pills and syrups, and directly in the bloodstream, via \n\nhypodermic needles [1]. When using the oral method, drugs must pass through the \n\ndigestive system, which can lead to a change in the drug\u2019s composition (or even loss) due \n\nto the gastric juices and metabolization by the liver [2]. During the delivery and diffusion \n\nprocess drug integrity must be guaranteed, as well as, it side effects that can affect the \n\ndigestive system and it behavior in such environment [2]. \n\nThe use of hypodermic needles (being subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular \n\nor intradermal) eliminate such problems, bypassing completely the digestive system, \n\ndelivering the drug directly to the bloodstream. When choosing this delivery method \n\nseveral factors should be considered such as, the emotional trauma and pain associated \n\nwith injections, the risk of needle-related injuries, patient compliance and even the safe \n\ndisposal of the needles [3]. In addition, the administration of the injection requires special \n\ntraining and expertise. \n\nTransdermal drug delivery (Transdermal Drug Delivery System, TDDS), a topic \n\nthat as gain a lot of attention in the past years, appears as a valid alternative to the \n\ntraditional methods, providing control over the rate of drug release. TDDS is a system \n\nthat can provide what the other two methods cannot: it bypasses the digestive system and \n\nit does not have the same disadvantages of hypodermic injections. Besides, the skin \n\ncontains a large number of antigen-presenting cells (i.e., Langerhans cells and dermal \n\ndendritic cells), becoming a suitable way for drug delivery [6-8].  Drug patches and \n\nmicroneedles (MN) have been both thoroughly investigated [2, 3]. The first transdermal \n\nsystem for systemic delivery was approved for use in the United States in 1979, a three-\n\nday patch that delivers scopolamine to treat motion sickness [7]. Ten years later, nicotine \n\npatches become the first transdermal blockbuster, raising awareness to the transdermal \n\ndelivery in medicine and for the general public [4, 5]. The main difference between the \n\ntwo types of transdermal delivery systems is that patches are limited to a restrict amount \n\nand nature of drugs, while MN are compatible with a wide range of drugs being also more \n\n\n\nBackground and context \n\n3 \n \n\nefficient in the delivery process [1]. Instead of relying on skin permeability, MNs \n\nphysically introduce the drug into the body, accessing the epidermal and the top of the \n\ndermal layer of the skin. This is of major importance, as it means that the microneedles \n\nare short enough to avoid the nerve endings, causing no pain. The dimensions of MNs are \n\nlower than 1500 micrometer in length and, in the range of 50-250 and 10-25 micrometers \n\nin width and tip diameter, respectively. \n\nBesides the above mentioned, MNs provide a number of other advantages: (i) \n\nlower concentrations can be used since the drug release is controlled, providing a precise \n\ndosage; (ii) it\u2019s a method that requires no special qualifications for administration, \n\nopening the way to auto-administration; (iii) due to its micrometric size, can be produced \n\nin large quantities, reducing the manufacturing cost and; (iv) provides total release of the \n\ndrug maintaining its stability, among others [9, 10]. \n\nThree major types of MN are commonly described in the literature, depending on \n\nthe drug and application: solid (which include coated and dissolving microneedles), \n\nhollow and porous [10]. Besides that, MN based material has also a significant influence \n\non their effectiveness. Several materials are already used to produce MNs, including \n\nbiodegradable polymers [11], metals [12], soluble sugars [13], glasses and ceramics [14]. \n\nPolymeric MN are easily shaped but have a low mechanical strength [4], whereas metallic \n\nMN have a high production cost and could have compatibility issues with the drug. \n\nTherefore, finding a material that can be tailored to better suit the desired characteristics \n\nand properties while reducing production cost, is still required. \n\nCeramic materials appear as a new alternative to the existing options. Properties \n\nsuch as high mechanical strength, biocompatibility, and reusability (ceramic materials \n\ncan sustain high temperatures without deformation, so sterilization is a viable option) are \n\nof interest and draw increasing attention to the use of ceramic materials in the production \n\nof MNs. Research conducted by Luttge et al. showed promising results in the \n\ndevelopment of ceramic nanoporous microneedle arrays (npMNAs) for the controlled \n\nrelease of drugs and vaccines [4]. In this study, alumina based npMNAs have been \n\nprepared by micromolding followed by sintering at 1500 \u00baC [15] to create nanoporosity. \n\nThe authors showed that drug nanoparticles up to 100 nm can be loaded into the npMNAs \n\nand released with success in 30 minutes upon incubation in PBS [4]. Since drug loading \n\nin npMNAs is evaluated after sintering, the amount of drug absorbed is dependent on the \n\npore size and pore size distribution and surface absorption capacity of the npMNAs. \n\n\n\nBackground and context \n\n4 \n \n\nFinding a manufacturing process where the drug could be added during casting process \n\ncould be highly advantageous.  \n\nIn fact, ceramic-based components are commonly submitted to a sintering step, \n\nwhere the material is thermal treated at high temperatures (?1000\u00baC), to create a \n\nmechanically strong solid. Besides increasing the manufacturing costs, sintering step \n\navoids the incorporation of pharmaceuticals during processing, since drug molecules \n\ncannot withstand such high temperatures. To overcome this, the sintering step must be \n\neliminated in order to fabricate ceramic materials capable of incorporating \n\npharmaceuticals, while retaining its mechanical strength and drug delivery capabilities. \n\nIn a recent study evaluated by B.Cai et al. [16], self-setting bioceramics were introduced \n\nas an alternative to the above ceramics. By eliminating the sintering step, the damage \n\ncaused to the loaded drugs by the high temperatures was avoided, while maintaining the \n\nrequired mechanical strength in order to pierce skin. Brushitic microneedles loaded with \n\nZolpidem tartrate to treat insomnia were successfully prepared by micromolding. Being \n\na first-of-its-kind essay involving self-setting ceramic microneedles as a vehicle for \n\ncontrolled drug delivery, this study opens new opportunities for advacing with research \n\nin self-setting MN. Although being an innovative work, several questions need to be \n\nanswered in what concerns manufacturing costs, formulations and real world day-to-day \n\nviability. \n\nThus, the present work will try and shed some light on the subject, exploring the \n\nproduction and characterization of apatitic and brushitic calcium phosphate porous \n\nmicroneedles and how they behave as a controlled delivery system of an antibiotic \n\n(levofloxacin). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter One: \n\nTheoretical Introduction \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Theoretical Introduction \n \n \n\n6 \n \n\n1. Theoretical Introduction \n\n1.1 - The skin \n\nThe human body is a complex system composed of different organs and systems. The \n\nhuman skin is the largest organ of the integumentary system (organ system composed by the \n\nskin, hair and nails) composed of up to seven layers of ectodermal tissue that guards the \n\nunderlying bones, ligaments, muscles and internal organs, as well as, several structures called \n\nappendages (hair follicles and glands). Surrounding all the human body, the skin is the interface \n\nwith this environment, playing an important role in immunity and protecting the body against \n\npathogens and excessive water loss. Other functions include insulation, temperature regulation, \n\nsensation, synthesis of vitamin D and regeneration. This system can be divided into two types \n\nof skin: hairy skin (with hair follicles and sebaceous glands) and glabrous skin (a skin type on \n\nthe palms and soles and lacks hair follicles). \n\n1.1.1 - Structure of the skin \n\nThree layers of the skin can be recognized: epidermis, dermis and hypodermis, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 1. A healthy interaction between the layers is important for the maintenance of \n\nhomeostasis in the adult. In this section, each layer will be considered separately.   \n\nEpidermis \n\nThe epidermis is the outer most layer of the skin (50 to 100 ?m) that is divided into the \n\nfollowing sublayers (Figure 2), from top to bottom [17]: \n\nFigure 1- Cross-section of the skin, showing it 3 main layers, as well as, some of its \nconstituents. \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Theoretical Introduction \n \n \n\n7 \n \n\n Stratum corneum (SC): consisting of mainly keratinocytes (approximately 90-95% of \n\nepidermal cells) containing a protein known as keratin. The thick layer (10 to 20 ?m thick) \n\nprovides a major barrier against water loss and permeation of environmental substances, as \n\nwell as contributing to mechanical protection; \n\n Stratum lucidum: this sublayer is present in the thick skin of palms and soles and \n\nconsists of a thick layer of dead cells, functioning as a barrier and having water proof \n\nproperties; \n\n Stratum granulosum: also known as the granular layer, mainly consists of stratified cells \n\narranged in one to three rows. Besides the palms and soles, the skin lacks a well-defined stratum \n\nlucidum and stratum granulosum; \n\n Stratum spinosum: formed by cuboidal cells arranged in multiple layers, it has the \n\ncapability to synthesize keratin; \n\nStratum basale or Stratum germinatum: this sublayer consists of tall columnar cells that \n\nare constantly undergoing cell division and help form new keratinocytes that will replace the \n\ndead ones form the stratum corneum.  \n\nThis outmost layer of the skin contains no blood vessels, so cell nutrition is made almost \n\nexclusively by diffused oxygen from the surrounding air and, to a slighter degree, by blood \n\ncapillaries extending to the outer layer of the dermis. Merkel cells and keratinocytes are the \n\nmain type of cells which make up the Epidermis, with melanocytes (pigment producing cells) \n\nand Langerhans cells (dendritic immune cells) also presented [18].  \n\n \n\nFigure 2- Diagram of the epidermis. From: (R. Randall Wickett and Marty O. Visscher) [18]. \n\nEpidermis \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Theoretical Introduction \n \n \n\n8 \n \n\nDermis \n\nThe dermis or corium is a thick layer of skin (1 to 2 mm) that lies between the epidermis \n\nand subcutaneous layer, sustaining and supporting the epidermis. It is composed of two \n\nsublayers, the more superficial papillary dermis and the deeper reticular dermis. The papillary \n\ndermis consists of loose connective tissue containing capillaries, elastic fibers, reticular fibers \n\nand some collagen. The reticular dermis consists of a thicker layer of dense connective tissue \n\ncontaining larger blood vessels, closely interlaced elastic fibers and bundles of collagen fibers \n\narranged in layers parallel to the surface. The deep surface of the dermis is highly irregular and \n\nborders the subcutaneous layer, which additionally cushions the skin [19]. \n\n \n\nHypodermis \n\nAlso known as the subcutaneous tissue, this layer lies below the dermis and serving as \n\na connection to the underlying bone and muscle, supplies the upper layers with blood vessels \n\nand nerves and insulates the body. Consists mainly of loose connective tissue and elastin, \n\nallowing for its mobility over underlying structures [17]. \n\n \n\n1.1.2 - Permeability of the skin \n\nA variety of different compounds gets into contact with the skin every day, through the \n\nuse of household chemicals, application of cosmetics or pharmaceutical products or even by \n\naccident. Some of those chemicals may be absorbed or facilitate the absorption of other kinds \n\nof harmful components. \n\nThe stratum corneum (SC), being the outmost layer of the epidermis, acts like a barrier \n\npreventing the penetration of molecules to the lower layers [18]. The SC is often compared to \n\na brick wall [20], where  the corneocytes (keratinocytes) are like  the \u201cbricks\u201d and the layers of \n\nlipids between the cells like the \u201cmortar\u201d. This lipidic \u201cmortar\u201d layer is released by the \n\nkeratinocytes, filling the gaps between them and preventing water from passing through. The \n\nvery specialized \u201cbricks and mortar\u201d, work together to produce a layer that is both flexible and \n\nprotective [21, 22]. Some molecules, like lipid soluble molecules, are able to diffuse through \n\nthe lipid \u201cmortar\u201d, bypassing the barrier, but that\u2019s not the case for all molecules. Delivery of \n\na drug or a cosmetic into and through the skin involves a number of steps including release \n\nfrom the vehicle, partition into the skin and subsequent movement through the SC [23]. A \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Theoretical Introduction \n \n \n\n9 \n \n\ncomplete agreement still does not exist on whether lipid layers or corneocytes are the main \n\ncontributor to the permeability barrier [24]. Penetration studies and mathematical models [24-\n\n29] have demonstrated that the SC behaves like a passive diffusion barrier, being necessary \n\nadditional chemicals to facilitate the diffusion though this layer, as the diffusion rate is highly \n\ndependent on the molecular weight and lipophilicity of the molecules [25]. Alternatively, \n\nmechanical penetration of the upper layer of the skin bypasses this problem. However other \n\ndifferent problems arise related to the vehicle of delivery, its resistance, composition, \n\nbiocompatibility, and general discomfort related to the application.  \n\n \n\n1.1.3 - Mechanical properties of the skin  \n\nThe mechanical and biomechanical properties of the skin are of extremely importance \n\nto its health and disease, structural integrity, and aging. Studies about this subject began in the \n\n19th century [30], further underlying its importance. Investigations in the fields of plastic \n\nsurgery [31-33], skin cancer [34-36], cosmetics [37-39] and skin aging [40,41] further \n\ncontributed to the understanding of the biomechanical properties of the skin. \n\nOptical coherence electrography (OCE), also known as Optical coherence tomography \n\n(OCT) has been used to deduce mechanical properties in tissues [42, 43]. Introduced by Schmitt \n\nin 1944 [44], this technique was first used to assess the tissue biomechanics through the \n\nmeasurement of localized deformation and strain inside a sample. Further advances [45-48] \n\nenabled OCE to assess and extract different parameters of the tissue deformation with high \n\naccuracy and to reconstruct the tissue\u2019s biomechanical properties [49]. In a study evaluated  by \n\nXing Liang and Boppart, OCE was used to determine the mechanical properties of the skin \n\nunder different conditions (normal, hydrated and dehydrated), revealing that the stratum \n\ncorneum has a Young modulus of 101.20 kPa for normal skin, 21.01 kPa for hydrated skin and \n\n300.41 kPa for dehydrated skin, confirming that the mechanical strength of the skin is directly \n\ncorrelated to its hydration [31]. \n\n \n\n1.1.4 - Skin Penetration \n\nKnowing the mechanical properties of the skin is of the upmost importance when drug \n\ndelivery is done through the skin. As mentioned above, the stratum corneum acts as a barrier \n\nthat needs to be penetrated to efficiently deliver pharmaceuticals to the bloodstream. Structures \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Theoretical Introduction \n \n \n\n10 \n \n\nlike microneedle arrays, made from different materials, can be used to pierce the skin \n\neffectively [50]. The force needed to achieve this is a subject that has been investigated [51], \n\nbeing a parameter that not only affects the penetration depth but also the force that an array can \n\nhandle.  \n\nIn the study presented by Ryan F. Donnelly et al. [52], OCT was used for the first time \n\nto investigate the effect of a microneedle (MN) geometry and applied force upon penetration \n\ninto neonatal porcine skin in vitro using poly(methylvinylether-co-maleic anhydride) \n\n(PMVE/MA) MNs. The research work shows that MN height can influence the extent of drug \n\ndelivery across the skin and that higher application force corresponds to a higher penetration \n\ndepth, as expected.  \n\nRomgens et al [53] monitored both the penetration depth and force of single solid \n\nmicroneedles with various tip diameters. The authors shown that sharp microneedles are \n\nessential to insert them in a well-controlled way to a desired depth. \n\nShape, geometry, tip diameter, mechanical strength and based materials are all parameters \n\nthat need to be considered in order to create a device that can easily deliver pharmaceuticals \n\nthrough the skin. Microneedles appear as a suitable solution for transdermal drug delivery [9, \n\n54-56], as discussed in the next section. \n\n \n\n1.2 - Microneedles  \n\nFor many years, hypodermic needles have been the most used technique for transdermal \n\ndrug delivery. However, recent discoveries and advances in the biotechnology field showed \n\nthat this delivery system has several limitations and disadvantages [11, 16]. As soon as new \n\nways to fabricate microneedles for transporting nano-size molecules are discovered, the use of \n\nhypodermic needles could be discarded for certain applications, since they cause discomfort \n\nand limit the range of delivery.  \n\nMicroneedles can be divided in three categories: solid microneedles, hollow \n\nmicroneedles and porous microneedles, as schematically shown in Figure 3. In turn, solid \n\nmicroneedles include: (i) the ones used to create porosity in the skin prior to drug \n\nadministration, (ii) drug-coated solid microneedles where the drug is dissolved by the skin and \n\nthe MN patch subsequently removed, and (iii) dissolving MN where complete patch containing \n\ndrug molecules is adsorbed by the sky. Hollow Microneedles are considered the most \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Theoretical Introduction \n \n \n\n11 \n \n\nchallenging ones in terms of fabrication, due to the presence of a fine hole (50-100 ?m) in their \n\nmiddle, and can be used to deliver liquid-like drugs.  In porous MN, drug is usually captured \n\nin the pores and released by diffusion mechanisms after skin penetration [10]. \n\nThis work, will be essentially focused on porous microneedles, its composition, \n\ngeometries, fabrication methods and applications. \n\n \n\n1.2.1 - Solid microneedles  \n\n1.2.1.1 - Materials used in the fabrication of solid microneedles \n\nOne of the first strategies for the transdermal drug delivery is based on the use of solid \n\nMNs, where the microneedle array is first applied to the skin, creating micro-channels that \n\nallow the subsequently application of the drug [10]. However, some limitations of this method \n\nare clear: (1) a two-step process is needed, which may lead to practicality issues to the end user, \n\n(2) limited to certain type of drugs (usually cosmetics), between others. \n\nSeveral materials have been used to produce MNs capable of transdermal drug delivery. \n\nConsidering solid MNs, silicon [58], metals, polymers [59] and ceramics [19, 20] have been \n\nused as based materials. While being a high throughput manufacturing method, \n\nmicrofabrication methods for most of the MNs (silicon, metals, polymers based) are often \n\nexpensive, highly specialized and include complex multi-step processes [11, 21]. Standard \n\nFigure 3- Different types of microneedles according to their structure and drug delivery \nmechanisms [4]. \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Theoretical Introduction \n \n \n\n12 \n \n\nmetals usually utilized in the medical practice, such as stainless steel and titanium, have also \n\nbeen used as structural materials for solid MN fabrication [22-25], mainly because such \n\nmaterials should not raise any issues of safety, facilitating the regulatory pathway to \n\ncommercial acceptance.  Polymers are a viable alternative when compared to metals or silicon, \n\nalthough mechanical properties are usually poor.    \n\nDeveloping a complex structure in the micrometer scale such as a microneedle array is \n\nnot an easy task. Furthermore, obtaining MN patches at an affordable cost implies the use of \n\ncost-efficient manufacturing processes. Among the high tech processes used in microneedle \n\nmanufacture, such as, laser cutting [66], lithography [67] and wet and dry etching [68], micro \n\nmolding is the most explored one for MN fabrication [69]. However, as in all replication \n\nmethods, the first and most crucial step is to create a master structure, to obtain the mold \n\n(usually PDMS, polydimethylsiloxane, based) where the desired structure will be shaped. \n\nAlthough the requirements for the master structure differ with respect to the physical \n\nparameters of the chosen replication method, four basic statements are common [69]:  \n\n(a) The geometrical replication result can only be as good (or as bad) as the geometrical \n\naccuracy of the master; \n\n(b) For the ability to separate mold and molded part (demolding step), no undercuts in the \n\nstructure itself can be allowed; \n\n(c) The surface roughness of the master should be as low as possible; \n\n(d) A suitable interface chemistry between master and substrate must be chosen. \n\nThe prevailing technique used for fabricating PDMS devices involves master creation \n\nby a process called photolithography [70], which is a time consuming, multi-step and expensive \n\nprocess that needs to be carried out in a clean environment. While mold replication from the \n\nmaster could be an easy and costly efficient process, master fabrication involves the use of \n\nexpensive advanced processing technologies. Eliminating the need for a master in micro \n\nmolding fabrication could steeply decrease the total cost of the fabrication process, as well as \n\nits complexity. Hamsapriya et al. [71] published a study reporting the use of laser pulses to \n\ndirectly fabricate 2D and 3D structures in micro-scale on PDMS. Using a short pulse-to-pulse \n\nlaser capable of achieving localized rapid heating (femtosecond laser) directly on thin PDMS \n\nlayer, Hamsapriya et al. created a single-step masterless fabrication of PDMS microstructures.  \n\nTaking advantage of casting techniques in PDMS micro molding, ceramics have been \n\nrecently explored for MN fabrication [15, 60, 61, 72]. Gel casting was mentioned in literature \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Theoretical Introduction \n \n \n\n13 \n \n\nas a capable technique to fabricate this kind of micro components with complex geometries \n\nand dimensions lower that 1 mm [26, 27]. For that, ceramic suspensions parameters, such as \n\nsolids loading, pH [74], surface chemistry [75] and interactions between ceramic particles with \n\nthe dispersing agent [76] are of major importance and need to be precisely controlled in order \n\nto obtain the desired MN properties [60]. While in gel casting process of macro components, \n\ndifferent gelling agents can be used, for micro component fabrication specific requirements \n\nshould be addressed. The system \u201cepoxy resin plus hardener\u201d, presented by Olhero et al. [60], \n\nhas been proved to be adequate to obtain low viscosity suspensions during mold casting, to \n\nguarantee complete filling of the microparts, as well as high green strength (around 35 MPa) \n\nto de-mold them without damaging. Olhero et al.[60], highlighted for the first time, the \n\nrelevance of the specific interactions between processing additives and oxide particles having \n\ndifferent surface chemistries (alumina, silica and zirconia) in determining the kinetics of curing \n\nand the properties of green bodies consolidated by Epoxy Gel Casting (EGC) process. The \n\nwork developed by Olhero et al. demonstrated that EGC is a promising technology for the \n\nmicrofabrication of ceramic components with complex shapes and sharp features, opening a \n\nnew way for fast replicating and cost-efficient production of MN.  Since ceramic MN obtained \n\nby this method should be sintered after de-molding, EGC was considered a promising \n\ntechnique for fabrication hollow ceramic microneedles for drugs administration in liquid form. \n\n \n\n1.2.1.2 - Self setting ceramic MN \n\nEven if ceramics could have some advantages when compared to polymers for MN \n\napplications, sintering procedure make them less attractive, not only due to the increase of \n\nmanufacturing costs but also to the limitation in drugs incorporation before this step. To \n\novercome this restriction, self-setting ceramics appear as alternative materials. Developing \n\nsolid MNs from calcium phosphate based cements is a new research field, with only one paper \n\npublished about the subject till date [16] (from author knowledge). In this study, Bing Cai et \n\nal. [16] explored the use of self-setting bioceramics for drug delivery, using Zolpidem tartrate \n\nas a model drug. Self-setting microneedles were fabricated from calcium phosphate based \n\ncements under ambient conditions to minimize drug degradation during fabrication and to \n\nfacilitate a higher drug loading capacity. The drug release study showed that the release rate \n\nfrom this type of MN array could be controlled by the bulk surface area, porosity and resorption \n\nrate of the ceramic needles. Moreover, the needles proved to be capable of piercing the stratum \n\ncorneum of the porcine skin. Promising results were obtained with this study opening the \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Theoretical Introduction \n \n \n\n14 \n \n\nopportunity to deeply explore the fabrication of MN by self-setting ceramics and their \n\ncapability to deliver drugs throughout the skin. \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Theoretical Introduction \n \n \n\n15 \n \n\n1.3 - Calcium phosphates \n\nCalcium phosphates (CaPs) are the most important inorganic constituents of biological \n\nhard tissues. In the form of carbonated hydroxyapatite, they are present in bone, teeth and \n\ntendons to give to these organs stability, hardness and function. Calcium phosphate crystals are \n\nalso found in nature as mineral deposits in considerable amounts, growing over the years, \n\nsometimes in extreme conditions of pressure and temperature. In contrast, biologically formed \n\ncalcium phosphates are often nanocrystals precipitated under mild conditions (ambient \n\npressure, near room temperature) [77].  \n\nApart from calcium pyrophosphate (Ca2P2O7), most calcium phosphates, previously \n\nused in vivo as bone substitutes in various forms, were calcium orthophosphates (presence of \n\nthe orthophosphate group PO43-), commonly named calcium phosphates (Table 1).  \n\nTable 1 -Some calcium phosphate compounds, their Ca/P ratios and symbols [78]. \n\nName Formula Ca/P Symbol \n\nMonocalcium phosphate \n\nmonohydrate \n\nCa(H2PO4)2.H2O 0.50 MCPM \n\nDicalcium phosphate dihydrate CaHPO4.2H2O 1.00 \n \n\nDCPD \n\nCalcium deficient hydroxyapatite Ca10-x(HPO4)x(PO4)6-\nx(OH)2-x \n\n1.50-1.67 \n \n\nCDHA \n\nAmorphous calcium phosphate Ca3(PO4)2.nH2O   \n\n?-Tricalcium phosphate ?-Ca3(PO4)2 1.50 ?-TCP \n\n?-Tricalcium phosphate ?- Ca3(PO4)2 1.50 ?-TCP \n\nSintered hydroxyapatite Ca5(PO4)3OH 1.67 HA \n\n \n\nAmong the numerous calcium phosphate compounds, only the precursor compounds used \n\nin this work will be referred and highlighted. \n\nMCPM is the most soluble and acid for almost all pH levels [78]. It can be obtained by \n\nchemical precipitation from highly acidic solutions at room temperature with a crystalline \n\nstructure similar to thin blades [79]. At temperatures above 100 \u00baC, a water molecule is released \n\nand MCPM is transformed into MCPA (anhydrous monocalcium phosphate). Due to his acidity \n\nand solubility, MCPM is not biocompatible, although it can be used in combination with other \n\nbasic calcium phosphates for the production of several calcium orthophosphate cements [78], \n\n[79]. \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Theoretical Introduction \n \n \n\n16 \n \n\nMany calcium phosphate cements (CPC) have been proposed as bone substitutes, some \n\nbased on the use of tricalcium phosphate (Ca3(PO4)2, TCP) [80]. TCP has three polymorphs \n\n[81] depending on the temperature, The low temperature ?-TCP phase (rhombohedral structure \n\n- space group R3cH and theoretical density, 3.07 g.cm-3) is obtained by thermal decomposition \n\nat temperature above 700-800\u00baC [82] and is stable up to 1125\u00baC. Above this temperature, ?-\n\nTCP is transformed with volumetric expansion into the monoclinic ?-TCP phase (theoretical \n\ndensity, 2.86 g cm-3), which has a complex crystal structure with the space group P21/a. ?-TCP \n\nis stable between 1125\u00b0C and around the temperature range of 1430\u00baC [83] - 1475 \u00b0C  (as \n\nshown in phase diagram of Figure 4), and it can be maintained at room temperature as a \n\nmetastable phase.  \n\nThe ?\u00b4-TCP is stable above 1430\u00b0C \u2013 1475\u00baC until the melting point of 1765\u00baC and is \n\nunable to survive quenching to room temperature [9-11].  \n\nPhase transformation through thermal treatment is the most direct way of obtaining pure \n\n?-TCP from ?-TCP [84], but is also a challenging one. Small quantities of ?-TCP  [78-82] \n\nand/or HA [85-87] in the final product have been reported, resulting in non-pure, and therefore, \n\nunwanted biphasic composition. The presence of ?-TCP as second phase is attributed to a \n\npartial reversion during cooling of the already formed ?-TCP phase [88]. As the polymorphic \n\nFigure 4- Phase equilibrium diagram for the CaO-P2O5-H2O system (C=CaO; \nP=P2O5; Ap=apatite) according to Riboud-[150]. \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Theoretical Introduction \n \n \n\n17 \n \n\n???-phase transformation is considered to be reconstructive  [85-87], the reverse ???-TCP \n\ntransformation would require surpassing a considerable activation energy barrier to proceed \n\n[89]. Considering this, reverting ???-TCP should only be possible under a very slow cooling \n\nrate or a long dwell at a temperature below the transformation temperature. Rapid cooling \n\ntechniques such as quenching [88-89] or a moderate to high cooling rate [89] (5\u00baC/min [92] \n\nand 10 \u00baC/min [93]) are suggested as a solution to maintain the desired ?-TCP purity.  \n\nBesides the influence of temperature in phase conversion, some studies have showed \n\nthat slight variations in Ca/P ratio (Ca/P=1.50) of TCP also affect ?-TCP purity, as shown in \n\nthe phase diagram presented above (Figure 4). These variations lead to the formation of small \n\namounts of HA (positive variation, Ca/P > 1.50) or CPP (calcium pyrophosphate, negative \n\nvariation, Ca/P &lt;1.50), as seen in Figure 5. Minor amounts of CPP are known to strongly affect \n\nthe ???-TCP phase transition, as shown by Bohner et al. [93],  Welch and Gutt [94], and more \n\nrecently by Torres et al. [95]. Starting from a ?-TCP powder with a trace of CPP to obtain \n\npure??-TCP powder is compromised, with strong possibility to have in the final product ?-TCP \n\nas secondary phase, which amount varies according to the cooling rate imposed on the \n\ncalcination cycle. \n\nAs shown by the work of Destainville et al. [96], a tight control over experimental \n\nconditions during the synthesis process, such as pH and temperature, greatly influence the \n\nresulting product. Figure 5 shows the Ca/P molar ratio versus the ripening time of powder \n\nsynthesized at different temperature and pH values. For a temperature of 30\u00baC and pH 8, a Ca/P \n\nFigure 5- Ca/P molar ratio of precipitates vs. ripening time for different synthesis \nconditions of aqueous precipitation method according to Destainville et al. [96]. \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Theoretical Introduction \n \n \n\n18 \n \n\n> 1.50 is obtained in the first 4 hours, insuring that no CPP is formed and the ???-TCP \n\nregression does not occur after thermal treatment. \n\n?-TCP and ?-TCP have been extensively used in medical applications due to the \n\nbiodegradable and biocompatible properties [78, 97]. Considering its biological interactions, \n\n?-TCP is non-toxic, osteoconductive and bioactive. Although its biodegradability is higher than \n\n?-TCP and HA, it is less stable and as so, more reactive [98]. Calcium phosphates can also be \n\ncategorized by one of their most important characteristics: solubility in aqueous medium. As \n\nso, depending on its chemical composition and porosity, CaPs can be organized by its \n\ndegradability (ordered from more to less degradable) [78]: \n\nMCPM > ?-TCP > DCPD > DCP > ?-TCP > HA \n\nProperties like tension, compression force and stress resistance are also parameters \n\nhighly dependent on the chemical composition and the porosity of the material that influences \n\nalso its applications [99]. \n\n \n\n1.3.1 - Calcium phosphate cements \n\nCPC\u2019s were first discovered by Brown and Chow in the 1980\u2019s [100]. Despite a large \n\nnumber of formulations, CPC are divided into two different end-products: apatite (CDHA) and \n\nbrushite (DCPD) [78]. These synthetic biomaterials are formed from a mixture of a solid \n\ncomponent and an aqueous solution, both reacting at room temperature to obtain a paste that \n\ncontains one or more types of calcium phosphates [101], as summarized in the diagram \n\npresented in Figure 6 [102]. \n\n \n\nFigure 6- Preparation of a CPC. Adapted from: (Driessens, 1997) [102]. \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Theoretical Introduction \n \n \n\n19 \n \n\n \n\nAfter mixing powder with liquid, a plastic paste is obtained, increasing viscosity as \n\nsetting time increases, losing its malleability and ability to deform. During setting reaction, the \n\ncalcium phosphates dissolve and precipitate into a less soluble CaP phase(s). The precipitated \n\nCaP crystals grow and become entangled, providing rigidity to the cement [78]. The chemical \n\nreaction occurring during the setting times of the CPCs is highly dependent on its chemical \n\ncomposition, and can be divided into two main types of reactions [103]: \n\n(A) Acid-base reaction, as for example when the neutral ?-TCP reacts with the acidic \n\nMCPM forming DCPC, as shown below (equation 1): \n\n?-Ca3(PO4)2 (s)+ Ca(H2PO4).2H2O (s)+ 7H2O (l) \u2013 4 CaHPO4.2H2O (s) (1) \n\n(B) Hydrolysis, when for example ?-TCP is mixed with an aqueous solution, forming \n\nCDHA, or calcium deficient hydroxyapatite (equation 2):  \n\n3 ?-Ca3(PO4)2 (s) + H2O (l) \u2013 Ca9(HPO4)(PO4)5(OH) (s)    (2) \n\n \n\n1.3.2 - Apatite CPCs \n\nSince the discovery of CPCs [100], numerous formulations have been proposed. Most \n\napatite CPC formulations have CDHA as the end-product of the reaction, having all of them a \n\nlong intrinsic setting time [78]. The mechanical properties of the apatite CPC highly depend \n\non its composition and can widely vary. The main factor is the ratio between the amount of \n\nsetting liquid (L) and cement powder (P) that varies directly with the CPCs porosity (low L/P \n\nratio results in low porosity), resulting in lower mechanical properties as the porosity increase. \n\nConsidering the excellent biocompatibility of apatite CPCs, applications for drug delivery can \n\nbe considered, as the CPC will not cause inflammatory response when in contact with skin \n\n[86]. \n\n \n\n1.3.3 - Brushite CPC \n\nDCPD is the product of the setting reaction of so-called brushite cements. These types \n\nof cements where introduced by Mirtchi and Lemaitre in 1987 [35, 36], where the DCPD is a \n\nresult of the ?-TCP + MCPM reaction, as shown previously in equation (1). Several \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Theoretical Introduction \n \n \n\n20 \n \n\nformulations to obtain brushite cements have been proposed, such as ?-TCP + H3PO4 [97], \n\n[105] and ?-TCP + MCPM + CaO [106]. According to Bohner et at. [105], the first formulation \n\nhas some advantages over the second one: (i) rapid and easy preparation, (ii) better control over \n\nthe chemical composition and reactivity, and (iii) better physical and chemical properties such \n\nas enhanced setting times and better tension resistance [105]. \n\nAll brushite CPC are obtained via acid-base reaction, meaning that the paste is acidic \n\nduring the setting reaction, since brushite only precipitates around pH &lt;6 [37, 39]. \n\nBrushite CPCs are biocompatible, bioabsorbable and rapidly degraded (in vivo \n\nconditions), due to their solubility [107] although the porosity has its influence. The high \n\ngrowth rate of the brushite crystals results in a low setting time, making it a material not suitable \n\nfor certain clinical applications [108]. To somewhat compensate this flaw, additives such as \n\ncitric acid [109] and glycolic acid [110], that inhibit the growth of DCPD crystal have been \n\nused to increase the setting time of the brushite CPCs.  According to Rom\u00e1n et al. [111] the \n\nhardening reaction (the complete formation of the crystals) of brushite has the duration of \n\naround 24 hours, for a Ca/P of 1.50 and using citric acid as liquid phase, although having a \n\nhigh initial reactivity. This is probably due to the fact that, at the end of the setting reaction, \n\nthe pH level of the mixture increases, which causes a decrease in the solubility of the reagents \n\n[97]. \n\n1.3.4 - Apatite CPCs vs Brushite CPCs \n\nAlthough both apatite and brushite cements are commercially available due to their \n\nusefulness for the reconstruction of bone defects, their behaviors in the bone defect are quite \n\ndifferent especially in respect to resorption. Brushite cement resorbed much faster when \n\ncompared to apatite one. This difference is caused by the compositional difference in the final \n\nproducts. As the name represents, final product of apatite cement is apatite, whereas final \n\nproduct of brushite cement is brushite being apatite the most thermodynamically stable phase \n\nat physiological conditions. Since the human body-fluid is supersaturated in ions of apatite \n\nphase, no physicochemical dissolution occurs in the case of the apatite cement (at physiological \n\nconditions) [112].  \n\nBrushite is the most stable phase at pH values in the range of 2.0\u20134.2 being formed \n\nbased on dissolution-precipitation reaction and entanglement of the brushite crystals during \n\nsetting reaction. However, brushite is a metastable phase at physiological pH and dissolves \n\nupon exposure to the body fluid [112]. \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Theoretical Introduction \n \n \n\n21 \n \n\nNonetheless, brushite cement dissolves much faster than apatite cement. As an example, \n\nApelt et al.[113] reported that brushite cement was used for the reconstruction of bone defects \n\nin sheep, and it almost completely resorbed after 6 months, whereas apatite cement did not \n\nshow any notable change for the same time period [45, 46]. \n\n \n\n1.3.5 - Properties of the CPCs \n\nCPCs have wide range of properties that are tightly linked to several factors that can be \n\ntailored according to the application target, as shown in Table 2. The final properties of the \n\nCPCs depending highly on the composition of its solid phase, ratio of the components in the \n\nmixture, additives and particle size distribution of the powder.  \n\n \n\nTable 2- Parameters that affect the properties of the CPCs. From: (Ginebra, 2008)[107]. \n\nPowder phase Chemical composition \nRelative proportion of its constituents \nAdditives (accelerators, retardants) \nParticle size distribution \n\nLiquid phase Additives (accelerators, retardants, cohesion \nparameters) \npH \n\nMixing parameters Powder/Liquid ratio \nMixture process (time, rotation) \n\nEnvironmental factors Temperature \nHumidity \npH \n\n \n\nParticle characteristics \n\nThe particle characteristics of powder phase heavily influence initial and final \n\nproperties of CPC. Particle size and size distribution, shape and specific surface area are the \n\nfour major influences of powder phase on the behavior of the CPCs. Particle size is directly \n\nrelated to the setting time and consequently to the mechanical properties of the CPC. For a \n\ngiven liquid to powder ratio setting time decreases as particle size decreases, since smaller \n\nparticles dissolve faster and the precipitation process of the new phase begins earlier [93]. \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Theoretical Introduction \n \n \n\n22 \n \n\nLiquid phase \n\nThe liquid phase composition in a powder-liquid mixture is also an important factor that \n\ninfluences final CPCs properties. The liquid is a vehicle for the dissolution of the reagents and \n\nfor the precipitation of the final products of the reaction. This aqueous phase can be just \n\ncomposed of distilled water or can contain many organic or inorganic additives that can be \n\nused to tailor CPCs properties. These additives can influence the setting time, rheological, \n\ncohesive properties and porosity of the paste/cement, for example: \n\n? Sodium hydrogenophosphate (Na2HPO4) [114]: accelerates the hardening process, \n\nlowering the setting times in apatitic cements; \n\n? Citric acid (C6H8O7)[109]: (1) slows the reaction time, increasing the setting time in \n\nbrushitic cements; and (2) accelerates the hardening process in apatitic cements, \n\ndecreasing the setting time. \n\nLiquid-to-powder ratio  \n\nThe liquid-to-powder ratio (L/P) is a very important parameter than can determine \n\nseveral properties of the cement [115], such as setting time [116,117], rheological \n\nbehavior[115] and mechanical strength [98, 117]. Higher  L/P ratios lead to a decrease in \n\nmechanical strength and higher initial (IST) and final (FST) setting times, which can be \n\nexplained by the increase in porosity caused by the higher amounts of liquid phase [98,117]. \n\nSetting time \n\nSetting time is defined as a specified time required for a paste/cement to change from \n\nliquid state to plastic state (initial setting time, IST) and plastic state to solid state (final setting \n\ntime, FST), so that the surface becomes sufficiently rigid to withstand a defined amount of \n\npressure [118]. It\u2019s a continuous process that can be described in three steps [119]: \n\n1. Dissolution of the reagents; \n\n2. Nucleation of the newly formed crystals; \n\n3. Growth of the newly formed crystals. \n\nThere are two methods used to determine IST and FST of a cement, the Gillmore needle \n\ntest [Standard Test Method for Time of Setting of Hydraulic-Cement Paste by Gillmore \n\nNeedles, ASTM C266-15] and the Vicat needle test [Standard Test Methods for Time of Setting \n\nof Hydraulic Cement by Vicat Needle, ASTM C191-13]. Both of these tests follow the same \n\nmethodology, analyzing the surface of the cement to assess if the needle produces an indent \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Theoretical Introduction \n \n \n\n23 \n \n\nafter contact [120]. The Gilmore needle test is more widely used, consisting of two different \n\nneedles: (1) a thick and light needle to assess the IST and (2) a thin and heavy to determine the \n\nFST. The Vicat needle test, on the other hand, uses only one needle at a time to determine the \n\nIST or FST.  \n\nEvaluating the setting times of a cement is essential to determine its handling time of a \n\ncement past. For the molding process, up until the IST, the cement is malleable, so it can be \n\ndeformed and molded to a desired shape. When the compound is in the desired shape and the \n\nhardening process is yet to be completed, it cannot be handled without the risk of producing \n\nfractures along the structure. The FST indicates when the hardening process is finish and the \n\nsample can be handled without damaging it. As in other properties, setting time can be \n\ninfluenced by different factors of the mixture (liquid and solid phases) as well as ambient \n\nconditions [107]:  \n\ni) Particle size; \n\nii) Crystallinity; \n\niii) Composition of the liquid phase; \n\niv) Temperature; \n\nv) Liquid-to-powder ratio. \n\nMechanical Properties \n\nThe mechanical properties of CPCs are a key property that needs to be determined to \n\nassess if the composition of the cement is adequate for the intended use. Generally, CPCs have \n\npoor mechanical properties [121-124], limiting its clinical applications. As a method of \n\nenhancing these properties, some authors used polymers such as gelatin [125] and short-length \n\npolyhydroxyalkanoate (linear polyesters produced by bacterial fermentation of sugar or lipids) \n\n[126]. Several factors can influence the mechanical properties of CPCs, as shown in Table 3 \n\n[127]. \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Theoretical Introduction \n \n \n\n24 \n \n\nTable 3- Properties of CPCs that can affect its mechanical behavior. \n\nProperty Effect \n\nFormulation [128] Maximum shear resistance can vary for \n\nformulation to formulation. \n\nLiquid-to-powder ratio [129] A higher L/P ratio leads to a decrease in shear \n\nresistance. \n\nParticle size [130] As the particle size decreases, the shear \n\nresistance increases. \n\nIncubation temperature [131] High temperatures can lead to the dehydration \n\nof the samples, weakening its structure. \n\n \n\nIn a recent study published by Ingrid Ajaxon et al.[132] the compressive strength and \n\nelastic properties of brushitic and apatitic CPCs were measured and compared. The brushitic \n\nCPCs were found to be stronger than the apatitic CPCs, in good agreement with other results \n\npresented in  literature [80,91,103,133,134]. \n\nPorosity \n\nWater is a major intervenient in the setting reaction of CPCs, as shown in previous \n\nequations (1) and (2). As a result, not all the water is consumed during the hydration phase, \n\nresulting in a porous structure.  The porosity of CPCs is directly related to the L/P ratio used \n\nvarying between 30% and 50%. Particle size distribution of the starting powders and particles \n\npacking behavior can also modify the microstructure, as well as the pores size and size \n\ndistribution [135]. Techniques such as mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) [136], gas \n\nadsorption and thermoporometry (TPM) [137]  and have been used to determine the porosity \n\nof CPCs [138]. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 2: \n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Materials and Methods \n \n \n\n26 \n \n\n2. Materials and Methods \n\nIn order to better understand how this thesis was conducted, the experimental work will be \n\ndivided into five stages of production. Each stage includes the characterization techniques that are \n\nrequired to either move forward to the next stage or to better understand its results. Stages are divided \n\nas follows:  \n\nTable 4- Description of the different stages of the developed work \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.1 - Stage 1: Synthesis of CaP based powders \n\nTo obtain brushitic and apatitic cement pastes, TCP (?-TCP powder) and BTCP \n\n(biphasic powder, mixture of ?-TCP and ?-TCP) were used as starting materials. These CaP \n\nbased powders where synthesized via wet chemical precipitation method according to previous \n\nworks [127].  \n\nThe synthesis process starts with the preparation of aqueous solutions (deionized water) \n\nof diamonium hydrogenophophate, ([(NH4)2HPO4.4H2O], Panreac, Spain) and calcium nitrate \n\ntetrahydrate, ([Ca(NO3)2.4H2O], Panreac, Spain) as phosphorous and calcium precursors, \n\nrespectively. In order to obtain a Ca/P ratio of 1.51, a 0.6M of P solution was used and the Ca \n\nconcentration was adjusted accordingly. Although the theoretical value of Ca/P ratio to obtain \n\npure ?-TCP is 1.50, a Ca/P ratio of 1.51 was used to ensure that no ?-CPP (calcium \n\npyrophosphate) was formed. The solutions were mixed inside a reactor at 30\u00baC and stirred at \n\n700 rpm for 4 hours. The pH levels were monitored in real time, as described below. pH was \n\nadjusted to 7-8 using an ammonia solution (25% NH3, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) with a final \n\n Description Characterization techniques \n\nStage 1 Synthesis of CaP based powders  pH and temperature monitoring \n\nStage 2 Calcination and milling of powders Particle size and size distribution \nCrystalline phases \n\nStage 3 Preparation and moulding cement pastes with and \nwithout drug \n\nSetting time \nMechanical properties \nPorosity and density \nCrystalline phases \nMicrostructural analysis (SEM) \n\nStage 4 \n \n \n\nStage 5 \n\nAntibiotic distribution and release studies \n \n \nMicroneedles fabrication \n\nRaman Confocal \nUV \n \nSEM  \nMechanical properties \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Materials and Methods \n \n \n\n27 \n \n\nadded volume ranging from 100 mL to 150 mL. After 4 hours, the precipitate was vacuum \n\nfiltered and dried at 100\u00baC for 72h.  The full process is schematically presented in Figure 7. A \n\ntotal of nine synthesis were performed, hereafter denominated as S-I, S-II, S-III, S-IV, S-V, S-\n\nVI, S-VII, S-VIII, S-IX, in order to have enough powder for the desired assays, resulting in \n\n200-250 g of powder per synthesis.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2.1.1 - pH and temperature monitoring  \n\nAs described in previous works [127], experimental conditions such as Ca/P ratio,  \n\nsynthesis time, pH and temperature, are essential to obtain the desired powder composition. \n\nFor the standard synthesis conditions available in the lab, the pH is not continually measured \n\nand the temperature evaluation is relied on the oil bath recirculation to maintain the targeted \n\n30\u00baC within the reactor. Since small fluctuations in pH could influence the final products, a \n\ndata logger (DrDAQ, PICO) coupled with a pH sensor (DD011) connected to a laptop running \n\na logging software (PICOlog) were used in order to monitor the pH in real time, obtaining \n\nvalues every second (Figure 8). This allowed a more precise control over pH conditions and an \n\noverall optimization of the reaction, raising the number of control points from ?30 to 14400. \n\nRegarding temperature, it was monitored by a digital thermometer equipped with a metal rod \n\nevery 5 minutes. The obtained data (.txt file) was processed using MatLab to automate the \n\nprocess. In order to better represent the data, every 10 minutes a total of 10 control points ([-\n\n5s, +5s]) were chosen, its average value calculated and then plotted. \n\nFigure 7- Schematic representation of the method used to obtain the CaP based \npowders. \n\nP \nprecursor \n\nCa \nprecursor \n\nPrecipitation Filtration Drying Calcination 1 \n\n(pH control) \n\nAmmonia \nsolution \n\nCalcination 2 \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Materials and Methods \n \n \n\n28 \n \n\n \n\n2.2 - Stage 2: Calcination and milling of CaP based powders \n\nThe dry precipitates were deagglomerated and then calcined. To obtain TCP, the CaP \n\nbased milled powder was calcined in a Termolab furnace at 1000\u00baC maximum temperature \n\nwith 2h holding time with a heating rate of 5\u00baC/min, followed by natural cooling to ambient \n\ntemperature. To obtain BTCP, previously ?-TCP powder  was submitted to 1250\u00baC maximum \n\ntemperature with the following schedule [127]: 10\u00baC/min until 1000\u00baC, followed 5\u00baC/min to \n\n1250\u00baC, with 10h holding time at this temperature with subsequent cooling to 30\u00baC at 20\u00baC/min \n\nrate.

In the present work, two cement paste compositions have been prepared to obtain \n\nbrushitic and apatitic cements. The system ?-TCP + MCPM (Monocalcium phosphate \n\nmonohydrate, [Ca(H2PO4)2.H2O], Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) mixed with citric acid aqueous \n\nsolutions (15%, [C6H8O7], Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) was used for brushitic cements \n\npreparation, while BTCP mixed with 3wt% of anhydrous sodium hydrogen phosphate \n\n[Na2HPO4] (Merck, Germany) or citric acid (10-15%) were used to obtain apatitic or brushitic \n\ncements, respectively [120]. The pastes were prepared by adding the powders with different \n\namounts of liquid phase according to the desired liquid to powder ratio: 0.28, 0.30, 0.34, 0.38 \n\nand 0.40 mL.g-1. For cements loaded with antibiotic, 2.5 wt.% of levofloxacin was added to \n\nthe paste. All pastes were then casted in different mold shapes according to characterization \n\nrequirements (pellets, cylinders or microneedles). The molded samples were then placed in an \n\noven with controlled temperature and humidity (37\u00baC, with a set humidity of 80%) for the time \n\nrequired for setting and subsequently de-molded and kept in the same condition for further 96 \n\nh.  After this period, in order to study the probability of drug migration to the surface of the \n\nsamples, two different drying processes were used: (1) cement samples were placed at 40\u00baC \n\nwithout controlled humidity until complete drying (oven drying, OD); (2) samples were \n\nimmediately frozen at -80\u00baC for 48h and then lyophilized for 24h (freeze drying-Liof).

For IST purposes the lower weight \n\nneedle was used while for FST was used the heavy needle.  The measurements consist in \n\npouring the needle onto the surface of the cement sample every 30s and observing if an \n\nindentation is formed. The process was repeated until no indentation was visible in the cement \n\nsurface, being this times IST of FST.  \n\n \n\n2.3.2 - Mechanical properties \n\nThe cement pastes were casted into cylinders (as shown in Figure 10) (? 6 mm, height: \n\n12 mm) for compressive strength measurements. For all cylinders, parallel base surfaces were \n\nassured (rectifying if not parallel) and its mechanical properties were tested using a Shimandzu \n\nAutograph (Japan), equipped with a 10 kN load cell (Figure 11). Each cylinder was placed \n\nbetween the pressure plates and compressed until failure at a strain rate of 1 mm.min-1.  \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Materials and Methods \n \n \n\n33 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 11- Cylindrical cement samples used for compressive strength test (left) and cement sample \nready to be tested (right). \n\n \n\nTo access the force that can be applied to the microneedle tip without breakage, was used the \n\napparatus presented in Figure 12 . \n\n  \n\nFigure 12 - Apparatus used to access the mechanical properties of the microneedle \ntips. \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Materials and Methods \n \n \n\n34 \n \n\n2.3.3 - Porosity and density \n\nThe total porosity (open and closed porosity) was determined from the real density and \n\nthe apparent density, as shown in equation 3: \n\nTotal porosity =  \n\n??? ???????????????? ???????\n\n\n??? ???????\n   (3) \n\nwhere,       \n\n? Open porosity: network of fine interconnected capillaries, connected to the surface of \n\nthe material; \n\n? Closed porosity: pores with no connection to the surface; \n\n? Apparent density: ratio between the weight and the apparent volume of a sample. Dried \n\ncement samples (40\u00baC for 4 days) were weighted and their apparent volume determined \n\naccording to the Archimedes principle by immersion in mercury, as presented in \n\nprevious works [127]. The apparatus used for this measurement was presented in Figure \n\n13.  \n\n? Real density: difference between the apparent volume of the sample and the total \n\nvolume of pores (open and closed), which was determined by a Helium pycnometer \n\n(Multipycnometer Quantumchrome, US). For this test, dried and milled cement \n\nsamples were used. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 13- Apparatus used to determine apparent volume of cement samples according to \nArchimedes Principle.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Materials and Methods \n \n \n\n35 \n \n\n2.3.4 \u2013 Microstructural analysis  \n\nScanning Electron Microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4100, Japan), was used to determine \n\nthe microstructural properties of the samples. The microscope is equipped with an electron \n\nemission system with a tungsten filament, and all the images were taken with an acceleration \n\nof 25 kV at different magnifications. Surface of the cement samples were observed. \n\n2.4 - Stage 4:  Antibiotic distribution and release studies \n\nIn this stage of the thesis, antibiotic distribution in cement samples and release studies \n\nwere carried out. Samples loaded with 2.5% of levofloxacin (oven dried and lyophilized) were \n\nanalyzed via Raman using a confocal Raman microscope (WITec alpha300 RAS+ (WITec, \n\nUlm, Germany). An Nd:YAG laser operating at 532 nm were used as excitation source, with \n\nthe power set 5mW (150 x 150 points per grid in a 50 x 50 ?m area, 2s) to access the drug \n\ndistribution on the samples. Drug release studies were carried out on the Faculty of Pharmacy, \n\nUniversidade Nova, Lisbon. \n\n2.4.1 - Preparation of the samples \n\nDuring preparation of levofloxacin loaded cement pastes with biphasic powder (BTCP) \n\nusing anhydrous sodium hydrogen phosphate as liquid phase composition, it was verified that \n\nresulting cement paste exhibited two phases (liquid and solid) instead of one (as per usual with \n\nthe samples without levofloxacin). This phenomenon was attributed to the lower solubility of \n\nthe levofloxacin in basic solutions when compared to acidic solutions. In order to verify this \n\nissue, the pH of the two used liquid phases (anhydrous hydrogen phosphate and citric acid) was \n\nmeasured and, as expected, the citric acid solution has a pH of 1.65, compared to the 8.58 pH \n\nvalue of the anhydrous sodium hydrogen phosphate solution. High pH values causes \n\ninsolubility of levofloxacin and consequently, the hindrance of cement setting with subsequent \n\nphases separation. To overcome this problem, it was decided to use citric acid (10%) as liquid \n\nphase for BTCP levofloxacin loaded samples for release studies.  \n\nAccordingly, cement samples were prepared using the formulations described in Table \n\n8. The resulting pastes were molded into cylinders (height: 12 mm; diameter: 6 mm), incubated \n\nfor 24 h (37.5\u00baC, 80 % humidity), frozen for 2 days (-80\u00baC) and lyophilized. In order to assess \n\nthe influence of the lyophilization on the drug release rate, samples from batch 2 (Table 8, \n\nTCP-0.30-L-OD and TCP-0.30-OD) were placed 4 days in a drying oven at 40\u00baC (Oven dried) \n\ninstead of being frozen and lyophilized.  \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Materials and Methods \n \n \n\n36 \n \n\nTable 8 - Batch formulations of the CPCs used. \n\nPrecursor Powders \n(P) \n\nLiquid medium \n(L), \n\nConcentration \n(w/v %) \n\nL/P \n(mL g-1) \n\nDrying \nmethod \n\nLevofloxacin \n(w %) \n\nCement  \nFormulation Name \n\n?-TCP + MCPM Citric acid, 15 % 0.30 Lyophilisation 2.5 Batch 1 TCP-0.30-L-Lyof \n\n?-TCP + MCPM Citric acid, 15 % 0.30 Lyophilisation 0.0  TCP-0.30-Lyof \n\n?-TCP + MCPM Citric acid, 15% 0.30 Oven dried 2.5 Batch 2 TCP-0.30-L-OD \n\n?-TCP + MCPM Citric acid, 15% 0.30 Oven dried 0.0  TCP-0.30-OD \n\n?-TCP + MCPM Citric acid, 15 % 0.34 Lyophilisation 2.5 Batch 3 TCP-0.34-L-Lyof \n\n?-TCP + MCPM Citric acid, 15 % 0.34 Lyophilisation 0.0  TCP-0.34-Lyof \n\nBTCP Citric acid, 10 % 0.34 Lyophilisation 2.5 Batch 4 BTCP-0.34-L-Lyof \n\nBTCP Citric acid, 10 % 0.34 Lyophilisation 0.0  BTCP-0.34-Lyof \n\n \n\n2.4.2 - In vitro drug release assay \n\nLevofloxacin loaded cylindrical samples were tested in order to determine the drug \n\nrelease profile and kinetics. For this study, 3 levofloxacin loaded cylinders and one blank \n\n(without loaded drug) from each batch formulation were used, amounting to a total of 16 \n\nsamples. Samples were accurately weighted, placed on a 50 mL Falcon tube and immersed in \n\n25 mL of a biomimetic medium (phosphate buffer saline, PBS, Sigma-Aldrich) at pH 7.4. The \n\ntubes were then placed on a 37\u00baC water bath (Memmert, Germany) and shaken horizontally \n\n(130 rpm) during the assay (72 h) (Figure 14A).  \n\nAt pre-determined times of 10 min, 0.5h, 1h, 2h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 24h, 48h and 72h, 5 mL of \n\neach medium was collected (and replaced with the same volume of fresh medium) and analysed \n\nvia UV-spectrometry, at 288 nm in a multiplate reader (FLUOstar Omega, BMG Labtech) in \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Materials and Methods \n \n \n\n37 \n \n\ntriplicate, as shown in Figure 14B. The absorption of the medium collected from the \n\ncorrespondent blank samples at the same time points were used as controls. \n\nCalibration curves were prepared in PBS medium with 7 standards (i.e. 75, 65, 50, 40, \n\n25, 15 and 5 ?g mL-1 of levofloxacin). The absorbance of PBS was also measured to be used \n\nas blank. The calibration curves were repeated for each time point and 3 replicates were \n\nconsidered for each standard. The standards were prepared from a levofloxacin stock solution \n\n(with a concentration of 500 ?g mL-1, obtained by the dissolution of 125 mg into 25 mL PBS,) \n\nmaintained at 37\u00baC during the assay. \n\nThe main assessments made during the release study are as follows: \n\ni. Levofloxacin release profile (over a 72h period); \n\nii. Release kinetics. \n\nFollowing the results of the antibiotic release essay, the best formulations were then \n\nused to fabricate the microneedles.  \n\nA B \n\nFigure 14- Schematic representation of drug release studies procedure.

After a certain time point is reached, 200 \u00b5L \n\naliquots from each sample (and blank) are transferred in triplicate (rep. 1 to 3) to a 96-well \nmicroplate and analyzed via UV-spectrometry at 288 nm (B). \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Materials and Methods \n \n \n\n38 \n \n\n2.5 \u2013 Stage 5: Microneedle fabrication \n\nThe preparation of the cement pastes for the microneedles casting was conducted as \n\ndescribed in section 2.3. The prepared pastes were then poured into a mold as seen in Figure \n\n15. Several casting processes were used to obtain the best filling results (filling full length of \n\nthe needle):  \n\ni. Manual casting: the pastes were poured into the mold and pressed downwards with a \n\nspatula; \n\nii. Vacuum casting: the pastes were poured into the mold and placed in a vacuum \n\nchamber; \n\niii. Ultrasound casting: after pouring the pastes into the mold, the mold was then placed \n\ninto a Petri dish and sonicated. \n\nThe manual filling was the technique that produced the best results and was the one used \n\nthroughout this thesis. Mechanical properties and SEM imaging were used to characterize the \n\nsamples, according to the procedure described in section 2.3.2 and 2.3.4, respectively. \n\n \n\nFigure 15- Silicon molds used to produce the microneedles. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 3:  \n\nResults and Discussion \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and Discussion \n \n \n\n40 \n \n\n3. Results and Discussion \n\n3.1 - Characterization of the starting powders  \n\nAs stated in Chapter 2, CaP based powders where synthesized via wet chemical \n\nprecipitation method, where a close monitoring of the pH and temperature was made \n\nduring the full complete synthesis time (180 min). These two parameters are of paramount \n\nimportance since they influence the phases formed. pH evaluation with time for all nine \n\nsynthesis is plotted in Figure 16, while average temperature measurements for each \n\nsynthesis are presented in Figure 17.  \n\n \n\n5.00\n\n5.50\n\n6.00\n\n6.50\n\n7.00\n\n7.50\n\n8.00\n\n8.50\n\n9.00\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180\n\np\nH\n\nTime (min)\n\nMean Synthesis I\nSynthesis II Synthesis III\nSynthesis IV Synthesis V\nSynthesis VI Synthesis VII\nSynthesis VIII Synthesis IX\n\nFigure 17 - pH values throughout the duration of the reaction for synthesis I to IX. \n\nFigure 16 - Average temperature values for synthesis I to IX. \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and Discussion \n \n \n\n41 \n \n\nAs seen in Figure 17, the temperature could not be maintained at a steady 30\u00baC \n\nbeing observed slight variations in the several syntheses evaluated (S I-IX). Concerning \n\npH, higher variations are observed in the first hour attaining more stable values from this \n\ntime to the end of the synthesis. Oppositely, synthesis S-VIII and S-IX presents the \n\nhighest pH values almost stable (pH 8 - 8.5) throughout full synthesis time, resulting from \n\nthe higher amount of ammonia added in the beginning of the synthesis.  \n\nThe dried powders resultant from the previous synthesis were then calcined (first \n\ncalcination at 1000\u00baC/2h holding time). X-ray diffraction was used to identify crystalline \n\nphases of the powders in all the synthesis evaluated (S - I to IX). Figure 18 presents the \n\nresults obtained. \n\nFor the experimental conditions used (Ca/P = 1.51, pH 7-8 and 30 \u00baC) powders \n\nfrom S-II, III, VII, VIII and IX presented ?-TCP as its main phase with different amounts \n\nof HA as secondary phase, except for powders resultant from S-I, IV, V and VI which \n\nseemed to be pure ?-TCP. The existence of HA in some powders could be explained by \n\nthe fluctuations in pH and temperature observed during their synthesis (Figure 16 and 17, \n\nrespectively), essentially in the first hour of the synthesis. None of the synthesized \n\npowders presented a detectable ?-CPP phase being a good indication for going further \n\nwith ?-TCP to ?-TCP transformation, since is stablished from a previous work that a ?-\n\nCPP phase produces an undesired effect in the ?? ?-TCP transformation [95, 127]. \n\nHowever, detecting low quantities of ?-CPP phase by X-ray diffraction is not an easy \n\ntask, as its most intense (2? = 29.6 \u00ba) and second most intense (2? = 27.6 \u00ba) peaks overlap \n\nthe ?-TCP peaks. Only the third most intense peak (2? = 28.9\u00ba), not being overlapped by \n\nany other peak, is used to identify this phase. Oppositely, traces of HA phase are easier \n\nto identify, with its most intense peak (2? =31,8 \u00ba) not overlapped by any of the ?-TCP \n\npeaks.  \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and Discussion \n \n \n\n42 \n \n\n  \n\nFigure 18 - Diffractogram of the calcined powders resultant from synthesis I-IX. The \nstandard JCDD PDF (codes in Table 5, section 2.2.2) of HA, ??TCP and CPP are also \n\npresented for comparison. \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and Discussion \n \n \n\n43 \n \n\nAccording to these results, powders from S-I, IV, V and VI were selected to \n\nproceed with further studies with ?-TCP powder. Powders from S- II, III, VII, VIII and \n\nIX were mixed and then submitted to the second calcination in order to obtain ?-TCP. \n\nUnfortunately, powders II and III were mislabeled for V and VI, by mistake. So, in reality, \n\nthe following mixtures were obtained: S-I, II, III and IV for following with TCP studies \n\nand S-V, VI, VII, VIII and IX for going further for ? to ?-TCP transformation (second \n\ncalcination at 1250\u00baC/10h holding time). Figure 19 presents the XRD results of the \n\nresultant powder after the second calcination. \n\n  \n\nFigure 19- Diffractogram of the powder resultant from the second calcination. \nThe standard JCDD PDF (codes in Table 5, section 2.2.2) ?-TCP and ??TCP \n\nare also presented for comparison. \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and Discussion \n \n \n\n44 \n \n\nSurprisingly, as it can be seen, the obtained powder is not pure ?-TCP, but a \n\nmixture of ?-TCP and ?-TCP, so a biphasic powder. The quantification of these \n\ncrystalline phases obtained by Rietveld refinement shows that powder presents 70 wt.% \n\nof ?-TCP and 30 wt.% of ?-TCP, which fitting is presented in Figure 20. This means that \n\npowder from synthesis V and/or VI after first calcination (Figure 18) should be \n\nFigure 20- Rietveld refinement used to access the amount of the crystalline \nphases in the powder resultant from second calcination. \n\nFigure 21 - FTIR spectra of powders resultant from synthesis V and VI (S-V \nand S-VI) after first thermal treatment. \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and Discussion \n \n \n\n45 \n \n\nresponsible for the appearance of ?-TCP. To clarify this, FTIR has been evaluated in these \n\nboth powders, which results are presented in Figure 21. \n\nIn fact, powder resultant from synthesis V is not only ?-TCP as identified by X-\n\nRay diffraction (Figure 19) but present a small amount of ?-CPP, only detected by FTIR. \n\nThe presence of the characteristic vibrational modes of the PO4 groups (around 550 cm-\n1, 607 cm-1, 942 cm-1, 970 cm-1 and 1042 cm-1) confirm the ?-TCP phase formation [139]. \n\nThe marked bands at 727 cm-1 and 1212 cm-1 are characteristic of P2O74- group of ?-CPP. \n\nThese bands are clearly visible in the spectrum of S-V and not in S-VI, confirming the \n\nexistence of traces of ?-CPP in S-V, which stabilizes??-TCP phase, explaining the \n\nexistence of ?-TCP phase after the second thermal treatment in the full mixture [95, 127]. \n\nFrom this point forward, the raw powders will be referenced as follows: \n\n? TCP (for ?-TCP powder);  \n\n? BTCP (for biphasic powder). \n\nPSD analysis was determined using the procedure described in Chapter 2, section \n\n2.2.1. Based on previous works [127], the milling was conducted in a controlled manner. \n\nThe powders were milled and analyzed for PSD in timed intervals to avoid decreasing the \n\nD50 particle size below 1 ?m.

Although the particle size distribution mentioned in the \n\nprevious work (bimodal distribution with D50 around 1 ?m) was used to obtain injectable \n\ncement pastes [127], a similar PSD can be also used to prepare ceramic pastes for molding \n\nmicroneedles. Since the tip of the microneedles ranges form 25-100 ?m ideally, reaching \n\na D50 around 1-1.5 ?m guarantees that this parameter will not influence the molding \n\nprocess. The D50 was used as reference parameter to choose when to stop the milling \n\nprocess.  \n\nBoth TCP and BTCP powders, present a similar bimodal particle size distribution \n\nwith D50 around 1.01 ?m and D50 around 1.27 ?m, respectively. Bimodal particles size \n\ndistributions are likely to allow the preparation of pastes with highly packing behavior, \n\nimportant factor to avoid high porosity levels and improve the mechanical properties of \n\nthe final cements [140]. \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and Discussion \n \n \n\n47 \n \n\n3.2 - Characterization of the cement pastes \n\nSelf-setting pastes for casting microneedles molds might follow two important \n\ncriteria: (1) high initial setting time to allow paste preparation and complete casting and \n\n(2) adequate mechanical properties for complete de-molding and skin penetration without \n\ndamaging. TCP and BTCP cement pastes were tested for its ISTs and FSTs to better \n\nunderstand how an optimization of the molding process could be made. Figure 23 shows \n\nthe ISTs and FSTs of the cement pastes obtained from TCP and BTCP powders, according \n\nto the compositions presented in Table 6 and 7 (Chapter 2). \n\nFigure 23 - Initial setting time (IST) and Final setting time (FST) of the cement \npastes obtained from TCP (A) and BTCP powders (B), according to the \n\ncompositions presented in Table 6 and 7 (chapter 2). \n\nA \n\nB \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and Discussion \n \n \n\n48 \n \n\nFor this analysis, the influence of L/P ratio, liquid composition and the addition \n\nof levofloxacin in IST and FST were studied for both powders. As expected, as L/P ratio \n\nincreases, IST and FST increases for both powders [141]. For TCP, IST increases from \n\naround 2 min to 5 min when L/P changes from 0.28 to 0.34 while for BTCP, IST increases \n\nfrom 10 min to 20 min when L/P increases from 0.28 to 0.40. For a given L/P ratio, the \n\npresence of levofloxacin increases the IST and FST for all cement pastes tested, when \n\ncompared with the same cements without levofloxacin. These results are in good \n\nagreement with results obtained by other authors [141,143]. \n\nComparing the two liquid compositions used in BTCP cement pastes, for the same \n\nL/P ratio (0.34) is possible to observe that IST and FST increases from 14 min to 17 min \n\nfor 10 % AC solution, but decreases to 6 min for 15% AC solution. Adding higher \n\namounts of AC (from 10 to 15 wt %) in aqueous solution, IST and FST decreases. Since \n\nfor 15 wt.%, IST is too low (5 min), it means that time for casting the paste in the mould \n\nwill be short to guarantee flowing conditions of the paste to the deeper parts of the mould. \n\nDue to that, 10 wt.% of AC solution was used for further studies and the remaining \n\ncompositions were discarded. \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and Discussion \n \n \n\n49 \n \n\n3.3 - Characterization of the CPCs \n\n3.3.1 - Mechanical strength, porosity and crystalline phases \n\nThe as-prepared TCP and BTCP cement pastes were molded into cylinders and its \n\nmechanical properties tested following the methodology described in section 2.3.2. \n\nCompressive strength (A), porosity (B) and crystalline phases (C) of TCP (Figure 24) and \n\nBTCP (Figure 26) cement samples, in presence and in the absence of antibiotic, dried in \n\ndifferent conditions, were tested.

As the porosity of a sample increases, its mechanical strength \n\nshould decrease, and vice versa. Moreover, compressive strength of cements increases as \n\nL/P ratio decreases with concomitant decreasing of porosity. This trend was verified when \n\nL/P ratio changes from 0.30 to 0.34 mL.g-1, instead for 0.28 mL.g-1 (Figure 24A) when \n\ncompared with higher L/P ratios. It can be attributed to: (i) higher viscosity of the pastes \n\nfor 0.28 mL.g-1L/P ratio, which difficult the casting procedure with subsequent air \n\nbubbles trapped in the cement paste; (ii) DCP as crystalline phase formed, which presents \n\nlower density than brushite phase.    \n\nAs it can be seen, drying samples by lyophilization increased the overall \n\ncompressive strength in all tested TCP samples when compared to the oven dried samples. \n\nThese results are in good agreement with porosity data (Figure 24B), since a lower \n\nporosity increases the mechanical strength of the cement. For 0.30 mLg-1 L/P ratio, the \n\naddition of levofloxacin decreases the compressive strength of the cements (oven dried \n\nand lyophilized), with concomitant increase in porosity values, while for 0.34 mLg-1 L/P \n\nratio, slightly variations in both properties were observed. This could be explained by the \n\nincomplete transformation of ?-TCP in brushite (DCPD) phase (Figure 24C and Figure \n\n25) for the TCP-0.34-liof in absence of levofloxacin. \n\nFor cements obtained from BTCP powders, increasing L/P ratio resulted in an \n\nexpected decrease in compressive strength for the cement samples prepared with aqueous \n\nsolution containing 3 wt.% HP (Figure 26A The porosity results (Figure 26B) for the \n\nBTCP samples indicate that using sodium hydrogen phosphate instead of citric acid \n\nresults in similar porosity values for the same L/P ratio (0.34). Increasing citric acid \n\nconcentration from 10 to 15-wt% decreases compressive strength values with a \n\nsimultaneous increase of porosity. Since citric acid acts like an accelerator of the setting \n\nreaction (Figure 23B), viscosity of the cement paste increases rapidly and consequently \n\nhandling time decreases. Due to that, casting procedure is difficult (likely to air bubbles \n\nformation), particles arrangement becomes more difficult resulting in a highly porous \n\nstructure.    \n\nAccording to the results obtained for TCP cements, addition of levofloxacin \n\nslightly decreases compressive strength, as well as, increases porosity.  \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and Discussion \n \n \n\n52 \n \n\n \n\n The cement compositions were analyzed via XRD in order to identify the \n\nconverted crystalline phases.  \n\nFigure 26- Compressive strength (A), porosity (B) and crystalline phases (C) of the \nBTCP samples submitted to oven drying and lyophilization and with a fixed liquid \n\nphase of hydrogen phosphate and 10% and 15% citric concentration. \n\nA B \n\nC \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and Discussion \n \n \n\n53 \n \n\n \n\nFor the BTCP samples (Figure 26C and Figure 27) prepared with HP liquid, \n\nCDHA is the main phase with unreacted ?-TCP and ?-TCP. In presence of AC as liquid \n\nphase, cements from BTCP powders present unreacted ?-TCP as the main phase with \n\nsmall amounts of brushite for BTCP-0.34-10AC in absence or in presence of \n\nlevofloxacin. For cement prepared with 15-wt% citric acid, monetite (DCP) was formed \n\ninstead of brushite. This can be attributed both to the lower setting times and pH values \n\nof the cement paste.  \n\nThe differences in the phases composition between BTCP cements prepared with \n\nHP and AC as liquid composition, explain the higher compressive strength values \n\nobtained for the cement samples prepared with HP. In fact, BTCP-0.34-HP3-OD and \n\nBTCP-0.34-AC10-Liof cement samples present similar porosity values while \n\ncompressive strength of the first is around 34 MPa, significantly higher value than the \n\nsecond one (around 18 MPa). The higher compressive strength is related to the higher \n\namount of CDHA (apatitic phase) in BTCP-0.34-HP3-OD. \n\nFigure 27- Diffractograms of the BTCP samples, for hydrogen phosphate (A) and \ncitric acid (B). \n\nA \nB \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and Discussion \n \n \n\n54 \n \n\nComparing brushitic (Figure 24) and apatitic cements (Figure 26), as for example \n\nTCP-0.34-Liof and BTCP-0.34-HP3-OD, similar porosity values can be observed while \n\ncompressive strength is significantly higher for the apatitic one, as expected.      \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and Discussion \n \n \n\n55 \n \n\n3.3.2 - Surface analysis  \n\nThe microstructural characteristics (surface) of the CPCs obtained from TCP \n\npowders, i. e., TCP-0.30-L-OD, TCP-0.30-OD, TCP-0.30-L-Liof, TCP-0.30-Liof, TCP-\n\n0.34-L-Liof and TCP-0.34-Liof are presented in Figure 28. Figure 29 presents the \n\nmicrographs of the BTCP-0.34-L-Liof and BTCP-0.34-Liof cements.  \n\n The large spherical pores shown in Figure 28 are most likely due to air bubbles \n\ntrapped in the cement paste during mixing and molding. Analyzing surface \n\nmicrostructures of the TCP cements obtained from 0.30 mL.g-1 L/P ratio (Figure 28), \n\noven dried and lyophilized, is possible to observe that lyophilized samples presented a \n\nsmooth surface with apparently less porosity, in good agreement with compressive \n\nstrength values for lyophilized samples (Figure 24A). Since total porosity values are \n\nsimilar for oven dried and lyophilized samples (Figure 24B), pore size and size \n\ndistribution should be different, i.e., lyophilized samples should present small pores \n\nhomogenously distributed, which could explain the better mechanical properties obtained \n\nfor lyophilized TCP cements (Figure 24A). The presence of levofloxacin seems to \n\ndecrease the crystals size, more visible in lyophilized TCP samples prepared with 0.34 \n\nmL.g-1.  \n\nFor the BTCP samples (Figure 29), the presence of levofloxacin appears to \n\nincrease porosity on the surface with larger pore size, in concordance with the results \n\npresented in Figure 26 A and B.   \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and Discussion \n \n \n\n56 \n \n\n \n\n  \n\nT\nC\n\nP\n-0\n\n.3\n0\n-O\n\nD\n \n\nT\nC\n\nP\n-0\n\n.3\n0\n-L\n\n-O\nD\n\n \nT\n\nC\nP\n\n-0\n.3\n\n0\n-L\n\nio\nf \n\nT\nC\n\nP\n-0\n\n.3\n0\n-L\n\n-L\nio\n\nf \nT\n\nC\nP\n\n-0\n.3\n\n4\n-L\n\nio\nf \n\nT\nC\n\nP\n-0\n\n.3\n4\n-L\n\n-L\nio\n\nf \n\nFigure 28 \u2013 Surface SEM images of the TCP samples (TCP-0.30-OD, TCP-\n0.30-Liof, TCP-0.34-Liof) with and without levofloxacin. \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and Discussion \n \n \n\n57 \n \n\n  \n\nB\nT\n\nC\nP\n\n-0\n.3\n\n4\n-L\n\nio\nf \n\nB\nT\n\nC\nP\n\n-0\n.3\n\n4\n-L\n\n-L\nio\n\nf \n\nFigure 29- Surface SEM images of the BTCP samples (BTCP-0.34-liof) with and without \nlevofloxacin. \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and Discussion \n \n \n\n58 \n \n\n3.4 - Antibiotic release studies \n\n3.4.1 - Quantification method \n\nCalibration curves (and their respective equations) were calculated for each time \n\npoint (see table in figure 30), and illustrated in Figure 30: Linearity (5-75 ?g mL-1) and \n\nreproducibility were analyzed and considered adequate for sample analysis, with a \n\ncoefficient value (CV/%) of 0.005 > CV > 0.251. \n\n \n\n \n\nClearly, as shown in Figure 30 by the decreasing slope, there was some \n\ndegradation of the levofloxacin in the media over the 72h period.

For all the formulations, at least half of the levofloxacin content was \n\nreleased in the first 8 hours, even with some major differences between them. Using the \n\nHiguchi model for that period, we can observe that the ?-TCP (BTCP-0.34-L-Liof) has a \n\nhigher kH than the ?-TCP formulations, indicating a higher initial release rate. Moreover, \n\nthe good fit of release data to the Higuchi model (during the first 8h) suggests that the drug \n\nis released by simple diffusion mechanism within this initial time frame (Bettencourt et al., \n\n2000). Overall, the best fitting model for all samples was the designated \u201ccoupled \n\nmechanism\u201d, first described by Frutos et al. [145] and previously used to describe other in \n\nvitro release studies of drugs from bone cements [146,147]. The model, defined in the third \n\nequation on Table 10, suggests a mechanism based on dissolution/diffusion process with an \n\ninitial burst effect. The term b(1 \u2013 e-kcmt) is associated with a first order kinetic dissolution \n\nprocess and the term c?t with Fickian diffusion. The b and c parameters represent the \n\ncontributions (in percentage values) of the dissolution and diffusion processes to the release \n\nof levofloxacin at any t time, and the parameter a is associated with the initial burst effect. \n\nThe b and c parameters varied inversely, with the dissolution parameter (parameter b) \n\nprevailing over the diffusion (parameter c) process for all samples (Fig. 32), while the \n\nparameter a in BTCP-0.34-L-Liof suggests a stronger initial burst release over the other \n\nthree formulations.  As so, on the first 8 hours, due to the higher concentration of \n\nlevofloxacin in the samples vs. the medium, the diffusion process prevails. As the \n\nequilibrium is reached, the dissolution process controls the rate at which the levofloxacin \n\nis released within the 72 hours. \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and Discussion \n \n \n\n61 \n \n\nTable 10- Fitted parameter values and r2 for the different equation models used to determine the \nrelease kinetics of levofloxacin in CaPs TCP-0.30-L-OD (1), TCP-0.30-L-Liof (2), TCP-0.34-L-\nLiof (3) and BTCP-0.34-L-Liof (4). \n\nEquation models Model parameters Formulations \n  1 2 3 4 \n\nFirst order k1 (h-1) 0.001 0.001 0.002 0.003 \n\nLt = 1 - e-k1t r2 0.9982 0.9983 0.9982 0.9978 \n\nHiguchi (8h) kH (h-1/2) \n0.5089 0.5089 0.551 0.7239 \n\nLt = kH ?t r2 0.9862 0.9845 0.9893 0.9978 \n\nCoupled mechanism a 0.3087 0.2072 0 6.4022 \n\nLt = a + b (1 - e-kcmt) + c?t b 73.178 153.40 25.029 104.89 \n\n c (h -1) 1.784 1.722 1.804 0 \n r2 0.9982 0.9983 0.9982 0.9978 \n\nLt denotes fraction of levofloxacin released at a given time t. k1 and kH are constants of the mathematical models; a \nrepresents the burst effect, b is related with the dissolution process and c with the diffusion process of the \u201ccoupled \nmechanism\u201d model.  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nFigure 32 -Levofloxacin release fitted curves with the \"coupled mechanism\" with the \nparameter of the model equation presented.  \n\n0.00\n\n20.00\n\n40.00\n\n60.00\n\n80.00\n\n100.00\n\n120.00\n\n140.00\n\n0 12 24 36 48\n\nC\num\n\nu\nla\n\nti\nve\n\n %\n L\n\nev\no\n\nxa\nci\n\nn \nre\n\nle\nas\n\ned\n\nTime (h)\n\nFit Cm (TCP-0.30-L-Liof)\nTCP-0.30-L-Liof\nb, dissolution effect\n\n0.00\n\n20.00\n\n40.00\n\n60.00\n\n80.00\n\n100.00\n\n120.00\n\n140.00\n\n0 12 24 36 48\n\nC\num\n\nu\nla\n\nti\nve\n\n %\n le\n\nvo\nfl\n\no\nxa\n\nci\nn \n\nre\nle\n\nas\ned\n\nTime (h)\n\nFit Cm (TCP-0.30-L-OD)\nTCP-0.30-L-OD\nb, dissolution effect\n\n0.00\n\n20.00\n\n40.00\n\n60.00\n\n80.00\n\n100.00\n\n120.00\n\n140.00\n\n0 12 24 36 48\n\nC\num\n\nul\nat\n\niv\ne \n\n%\n le\n\nvo\nfl\n\no\nxa\n\nci\nn \n\nre\nle\n\nas\ned\n\nTime (h)\n\nFit Cm (TCP-0.34-L-Liof)\nTCP-0.34-L-Liof\nb, dissolution effect\n\n0.00\n\n20.00\n\n40.00\n\n60.00\n\n80.00\n\n100.00\n\n120.00\n\n140.00\n\n0 12 24 36 48\n\nC\num\n\nul\nat\n\niv\ne \n\n%\n le\n\nvo\nfl\n\no\nxa\n\nci\nn \n\nre\nle\n\nas\ned\n\nTime (h)\n\nFit Cm(BTCP-0.34-L-Liof)\nBTCP-0.34-L-Liof\nb, dissolution effect\n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and Discussion \n \n \n\n62 \n \n\n3.5 - Evaluation of levofloxacin distribution throughout cement samples \n\n Raman spectra of the microneedle plates was used to access the distribution \n\nof the levofloxacin in oven dried and lyophilized samples.

However, comparing the Raman spectra obtained in top and bottom sides \n\nof TCP-0.34-L-OD and TCP-0.34-L-Liof based MN is difficult to observe significant \n\ndifferences and to draw reliable conclusions.   \n\n In order to shed light on this point, Raman confocal images were also obtained \n\nin both sides of the MN plates, which are presented in Figure 34 and 35 for, TCP-0.34-L \n\n(OD and Liof) and BTCP-0.34-L (OD and Liof), respectively.   \n\n Looking to the TCP samples (Figure 34), it seems that the lyophilized samples \n\nbenefit from this drying procedure, as the drug distribution seems to be more homogenous \n\nthan in the oven dried samples. On the other hand, the results from the BTCP samples are \n\nquite ambiguous, being difficult to draw any firm conclusions concerning the influence \n\nof drying process on drug distribution.  For that, additional experiments should be \n\nevaluated.  \n\n Furthermore, since drug release profiles for oven dried and lyophilized \n\nsamples have been similar (Figure 31), it means that levofloxacin distribution throughout \n\ncement samples should be analogous in both drying procedures. \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and Discussion \n \n \n\n63 \n \n\n \n\n  \n\nBottom \n\nBottom \n\nTop \n\nTop \n\nFigure 33 - Raman spectra of the microneedles from both sides of the array, top side (right, \nwith needles) and bottom side (left, without needles). \n\nFigure 34- Combined Raman images of TCP-0.34-L-OD (first row) and TCP-0.34-L-\nLiof (bottom row) samples.

SEM imaging (x30, x100 magnifications) was used to \n\ncharacterize microneedles and to measure them, while the other camera was used to \n\nacquire images that better represent the arrays. The results are shown in Figures 36-38. \n\nFigure 36- TCP-0.30-L-Liof microneedles.

The \n\nincomplete filling is derived to the not-yet optimized molding procedure and the PSD not \n\nbeing optimal (> 1 \u00b5m), as the larger particles can obstruct deeper parts of the mold (tip \n\nof MN). Other mentioned techniques (chapter 2, section 2.5), such as vacuum filling, had \n\nslightly worse filling performance for the same needle geometry [141], confirming the \n\nmanual filling as the best molding method for high viscosity pastes.  \n\nThe tips of the TCP-0.30-L-Liof, TCP-0.34-L-Liof and BTCP-0.30-Liof and \n\nBTCP-0.34-L-Liof based microneedles were tested by compressive test to evaluate the \n\nmaximum force that can be applied to the MN without damaging the tip. Results are \n\npresented in Figure 39. These values should be prudently analyzed since the MN in the \n\narray could present different length resultant to the incomplete fill of the MN mold (high \n\nstandard deviation values). As higher the length of MN, as sharper is the tip resulting in \n\nsmaller tip surface area and, consequently, lower mechanical resistance. The TCP-0.34-\n\nL-Liof composition was the most resistant with 110 N, followed by the TCP-0-30-L-Liof  \n\nwith 77 N and the BTCP-0.34-L-Liof with 57 N. \n\nComparing these results with the ones obtained by Cai et al. [16], the height of \n\nthe fabricated needles is 4 times the size of the ones obtained in this study. \n\n  \n\nFigure 39- Compressive force of the microneedles.  \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and Discussion \n \n \n\n68 \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 4:  \n\nConclusions and Future work \n  \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Conclusions and Future work \n \n \n\n70 \n \n\n4. Conclusions and Future work \n\nWith a main objective of producing drug-loaded ceramic microneedles capable of \n\npiercing the skin and successfully deliver all of the drug, this thesis can be considered a \n\nsuccess, at least on that point. From the obtained results, we can conclude: \n\n? The control of pH and temperature of the synthesis reaction are essential \n\nexperimental parameters to obtained the desired crystalline phases in CaP based \n\npowders; \n\n? The presence of Na2HPO4 in liquid phase composition used for the BTCP cements \n\npreparation avoids the solubilization of levofloxacin, interfering in the cement \n\nsetting. \n\n? The L/P ratio influences the mechanical resistances of the cements; \n\n? The addition of levofloxacin increased the setting times of all the tested \n\ncompositions; \n\n? The addition of levofloxacin slightly decreased the mechanical properties of the \n\ncements; \n\n? Drying process by Lyophilization increases the mechanical properties of the \n\nresultant cements; \n\n? All the cement based MN tested have enough mechanical strength to pierce the \n\nsurface of the skin; \n\n? From the release assay, we can conclude that the levofloxacin is 100% released \n\nwithin the first 48 hours, for all compositions tested. \n\nAs the microneedles present promising characteristics for future biomedical \n\napplications, further work should be done: \n\n? Developing an improved method for casting the microneedles; \n\n? Evaluate skin penetration tests with the self-setting microneedles obtained  \n\n? Evaluate the transdermal drug delivery in situ. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n\n\nReferences \n \n \n \n\n72 \n \n\n[1] S. V. P. Verma, A.S.
