The coastal plain, located in southern Brazil and \nin northern Uruguay, is mainly formed by four Quaternary barri-\ner-lagoon systems. Three of these systems were studied through the \nintegration of surface and subsurface data (geomorphological and \ntopographical mapping, outcrops description, geoprocessing, dating \nand Ground Penetrating Radar \u2014 GPR \u2014 records) and interpreted \nas the preserved, onshore portion of depositional sequences main-\nly controlled by glacioeustatic cycles of about 100\u00a0kyr. The stacking \npattern comprising these sequences is progradational with seaward \ndownsteping (highest sea-levels measured: 9.5, 8 and 3\u00a0m, respective-\nly), comprehending a degradational sequence set, or the regressive/\nfalling stage systems tract of a higher order depositional sequence \nidentified in seismic sections, with about 0.5\u00a0Ma. The youngest se-\nquence has diachronous systems tracts\u00a0 \u2014 while some sectors have \nalready transitioned from the transgressive to the highstand/falling \nstage systems tract, others are still under a transgressive context. It\u00a0in-\ndicates that, in this time and scale, the sea level is not the main con-\ntrol of coastal evolution, and autogenic factors are fundamental in the \nrun of geological record.\nKEYWORDS: Barrier-Lagoon; Glacioeustasy; Diachronism of Systems \nTracts; Ground Penetrating Radar; Rio Grande do Sul coastal evolution.\n\nRESUMO: O objetivo deste trabalho foi analisar o registro sedimentar \nda Bacia de Pelotas, contextualizando-o em escalas temporais e espaciais e \npropondo um arcabou\u00e7o estratigr\u00e1fico hierarquizado.

(1949), Vail et\u00a0al. (1977), Van Wagoner et\u00a0al. \n(1988), among others. Sequence stratigraphy has evolved \nfrom seismic stratigraphy (Payton 1977) and established \nitself as a revolutionary paradigm for the understanding of \nstratigraphic record (Wilgus et\u00a0al. 1988), mostly due to the \ndemand and technological development of the oil indus-\ntry and pioneer work of Sloss et\u00a0al. (1949). Sequence stra-\ntigraphy can be used in the analysis of the record in differ-\nent hierarchical ranks, from the great stages of sedimentary \nbasin filling to the evolution of depositional environments \n(Posamentier et\u00a0al. 1992; Schlager 2009; Catuneanu 2002; \nNeal &amp; Abreu 2009).\n\nThe Pelotas Basin coastal plain, located in Rio Grande do \nSul and Santa Catarina states, in southern Brazil and in northern \nUruguay, has the most complete record of Quaternary events \n\nalong the Brazilian coast (Fig.\u00a01). This\u00a0plain, with 770\u00a0km of \nextension and 15 to 100\u00a0km wide, is formed by alluvial fan \nsystems and by the lateral juxtaposition of four barrier-lagoon \ndepositional systems, firstly defined for Rio Grande do Sul by \nVillwock et\u00a0al. (1986). Such systems have evolved during the \nUpper Quaternary, due to the combination of allochthonous \nand autochthonous processes, such as the eustasy (Delaney \n1965; Villwock &amp; Tomazelli 1995; Tomazelli &amp; Villwock \n1996), tectonics (Rosa et\u00a0al. 2009), climate (Martinho et\u00a0al. \n2008, 2010; Lopes et\u00a0al. 2013), coastal dynamics, and sedi-\nmentary budget (Toldo Jr. et\u00a0al. 1999, 2004, 2005; Dillenburg \net\u00a0al. 2000, 2009; Gruber et\u00a0al. 2003, 2006; Dillenburg &amp; \nBarboza 2014). Thus, the understanding of the geological \ndevelopment of the coastal plain can be improved through \nthe application of sequence stratigraphy.\n\nTherefore, this work aimed at examining and organizing \nthe fragmented sedimentary record of the coastal plain of \nPelotas Basin, discussing scale issues, placing it in the context \nof the particular temporal and spatial scales, and proposing a \nstratigraphic framework to connect scales. Moreover, through \nthe stratigraphic analysis we intended to show the diachronous \nnature of stratigraphic surfaces and systems tracts.\n\n55\u00baW\n\nContinental Shelf\nContinental Slope\nContinental rise/\nabyssal plain\nCenozoic sediments\nVolcanic rocks\nGondwanic sediments\n(Paleozoic-Mesozoic)\nPrecambrian shield\nBasement highs\nFractures\nFaults\n0     100   200 km\n\nN\n\n30\u00baS\n\n35\u00baS\n\n40\u00baW45\u00baW50\u00baW\n\nFigure 1.

This framework resulted \nfrom the analysis of the main studies related to the evolu-\ntion of Pelotas Basin detailed ahead.\n\nPelotas Basin is located in the extreme south of the \nBrazilian Continental Margin (Fig. 1), and has an area \nof approximately 210,000\u00a0km2. It\u00a0borders Santos Basin \nto the north, through Florian\u00f3polis High (Gamboa &amp; \nRabinowitz 1981), and Punta Del Este Basin to the south, \nthrough Polonio High, in Uruguay (Urien &amp; Martins \n1978). The Pelotas Basin was formed due to tectonic \nmovements associated with the opening of the South \nAtlantic Ocean (Asmus &amp; Porto 1972). The\u00a0basement \nis composed of Uruguayan-Sul-Rio-Grandense Shield, \nSanta Catarina Shield and Paran\u00e1 Basin strata. Main \nstages of the basin filling are summarized in Figure\u00a02, \nbased on the works of Fontana (1996), Abreu (1998), \nBueno et\u00a0al. (2007), Neal and Abreu (2009), and Abreu \net\u00a0al. (2010).\n\nLow-Frequency Sedimentary Record: \nPelotas Basin\n\nAccording to Fontana (1996), the Pelotas Basin can be \ndivided into three major phases (Fig.\u00a02). These phases would \ninclude the formation of a Rift Megasequence, developed \nin the early stages of opening, followed by a Transgressive \nMegasequence that started in the Aptian, and a Regressive \nMegasequence, which evolved since the Paleocene. These \nthree megasequences were subdivided into 17 depositional \nsequences, five belonging to the transgressive phase and 12 \nto the regressive phase.\n\nAccording to Bueno et\u00a0al. (2007), main phases of basin \nfilling are the Pre-rift, Rift, Post-rift and Drift Supersequences \n(Fig.\u00a02). The\u00a0Pre-rift Supersequence is related to magmatic \nprocesses that occurred prior to the initial stages of rifting, \nwith the generation of thick volcanic flows (Serra Geral \nFormation). Continental magmatism was emplaced between \n138 and 127\u00a0Ma, with peak at around 132\u00a0Ma (Stewart \net\u00a0al. 1996; Bueno et\u00a0al. 2007). \n\nThe Rift Supersequence can be divided into two \nstages, Rift\u00a0I, with a predominance of basalts (Imbituba \nFormation), and Rift\u00a0 II, with siliciclastic deposition \n(Cassino Formation). This phase consists of filling anti-\nthetical half grabens approximately 125\u00a0Ma. The Post-\nrift Supersequence is composed of the volcanic suite of \n\nthe Curumim Formation (basalts, andesites, traquian-\ndesites), alternated with lacustrine sediments grading to \nmarine limestones and sandstones. Volcanic units com-\nprising the oceanic crust are represented by seaward dip-\nping reflections identified on seismic sections (Fontana \n1996; Abreu 1998). According to Bueno et\u00a0al. (2007), \nthe continuation of the opening process led to the Drift \nSupersequence, which was divided into three phases: \ninitial (shallow shelf ), intermediate (transgressive) and \nfinal (regressive wedge). Bueno et\u00a0al. (2007) interpreted \n12\u00a0depositional sequences in the transgressive phase and \nfour in the regressive phase, forming a siliciclastic wedge \n(Cidreira and Imb\u00e9 formations) from the Miocene to \nthe Holocene.\n\nIn Abreu (1998), 1,500\u00a0km of seismic sections were \ninterpreted in Pelotas Basin and 3,000\u00a0km in the con-\njugate Walvis Basin in West Africa. These seismic lines \nhave been integrated with core data in an attempt to \ncorrelate the existing record on both sides. In\u00a0this work, \nPelotas Basin has been divided into four units (Fig.\u00a02): \nBasement, Transgressive phase (Aptian-Turonian), \nAggradational phase (Coniacian-Eocene) and Regressive \nphase (Oligocene-Recent). The\u00a0 resulting stratigraphic \nframework is composed of 56\u00a0depositional sequences, \nin which 18 are Cretaceous and 38 are Cenozoic. \nThe\u00a0mean duration of sequences was determined based \non biostratigraphy.\n\nLow- and Medium-Frequency Sedimentary \nRecord: Accommodation Succession\n\nIn Abreu et\u00a0al. (2010), the stratigraphic framework \nestablished by Abreu (1998) for Pelotas Basin was used to \napply the Accommodation Succession Method proposed by \nNeal and Abreu (2009). According to this method, sequence \nstratigraphic units and key-surfaces are defined regardless \nthe time of duration, controlling mechanisms, or magni-\ntude of the events. Thus, resulting sedimentary architecture \nidentified to define sedimentary packages solely depends on \ntwo factors: on the rate of changes in accommodation and \non sediment supply.\n\nOn the hierarchical framework of Abreu et\u00a0al. (2010), \nfour composite sequences were established for the Pelotas \nBasin (Fig.\u00a03). Each composite sequence is formed by three \nsequence sets, defined according to their stacking pattern \nas Progradational-Aggradational (PA), Retrogradational (R) \nand Aggradational-Progradational-Degradational (APD). \nThus, 12 sequence sets compose the basin filling (Fig.\u00a03).\n\nThe last sequence set (APD4) comprises eight deposi-\ntional sequences (Abreu 1998). Following the same reason-\ning of Neal and Abreu (2009) and Abreu et\u00a0al. (2010), these \nsequences were grouped by Rosa (2012) according to the \n\n185\nBrazilian Journal of Geology, 47(2): 183-207, June 2017\n\nMaria Luiza Correa da Camara Rosa et al.\n\n\n\nMa\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n70\n\n75\n\n80\n\n85\n\n90\n\n95\n\n100\n\n105\n\n110\n\n115\n\n120\n\n125\n\n130\n\n135\n\n140\n\nE\nra\n\nth\nem\n\nSy\nst\n\nem\n\nSe\nri\n\nes Stage\nBased on\n\nFontana (1996)\nPhases &amp;\nTrends  Seqs.\n\nBased on Abreu (1998), Neal &amp;\nAbreu (2009) and Abreu et al.

Thus, the record that regards the upper portion of \nthe basin has the APD pattern, and the last sequences jointly \nhave a degradational architecture.\n\nAccording to Abreu (1998), the last sequence boundary \n(no.\u00a043) found in the seismic section is about 0.5\u00a0Ma. The\u00a0age \nof this sequence corresponds to the existing Quaternary sed-\nimentary record onshore, in which it is possible to interpret \nthat this sequence is in fact composed of higher frequency \nsequences. As\u00a0discussed ahead, these are partially represented \nin the onshore portion of the Pelotas Basin by the record of \ncoastal plain depositional systems.\n\nHigh-Frequency Sedimentary \nRecord: Barrier-lagoon Systems\n\nThe coastal plain is a physiographic feature correspond-\ning to the onshore portion of the Pelotas Basin (Villwock \n1984). Younger deposits of the basin fill are exposed, con-\nsisting predominantly of alluvial fans near the basement, \nand of four barrier-lagoon depositional systems (Fig.\u00a04). \nPioneer studies of these depositional systems were devel-\noped in the coastal plain Rio Grande do Sul by Backeuser \n(1918), Lamengo (1940), Rambo (1942), Delaney (1965), \nJost (1971) and Villwock (1972).\n\nAccording to Villwock et\u00a0al. (1986), these depositional \nsystems were controlled by glacioeustasy with resulting trans-\ngressive-regressive cycles. Also, tectonics (Rosa et\u00a0al. 2009), \nclimate, coastal dynamic processes, and sedimentary budget \n\n(Toldo Jr. et\u00a0al. 1999, 2004, 2005; Dillenburg et\u00a0al. 2000, \n2009; Gruber et\u00a0al. 2003, 2006; Martinho et\u00a0al. 2008, 2009, \n2010; Lopes et\u00a0al. 2013; Dillenburg &amp; Barboza 2014) have \ncontrolled the creation and filling of accommodation. In\u00a0this \npaper, we reviewed the age and sequence stratigraphic evolu-\ntion of Systems II through IV. System I, which outcrops in \nthe inner most position of the coastal plain and has almost \n100\u00a0m of altitude, is not yet as well studied as the other sys-\ntems and was not addressed in this paper.\n\nThe ages of the Barrier-lagoon Systems I through IV \n(400, 325, 125 and 7\u00a0ka to recent) have been first suggested \nby Villwock and Tomazelli (1995), based on oxygen isotope \nstages defined by Shackleton and Opdyke (1973) and Imbrie \net\u00a0al. (1984). These systems are interpreted to represent peri-\nods of high sea level, which Villwock and Tomazelli (1995) \ncorrelated to isotope stages 11, 9, 5 and 1, respectively. These \ncorrelations were confirmed for Systems\u00a0III and IV by 14C and \nthermoluminescence dating (Poupeau et\u00a0al. 1988; Tomazelli \net\u00a0al. 1998; Buchmann &amp; Tomazelli 2003; Dillenburg et\u00a0al. \n2006,ore recent work indicated that System II was developed \nin response to transgression related to the oxygen isotope \nstage 7, instead of stage 9, based on thermoluminescence \nages in quartzose deposits and electron spin resonance ages \nin fossil teeth (Lopes et\u00a0al. 2010, 2014). Then, according to \nthese authors, System II was deposited around 200\u00a0ka, and \nBarrier\u00a0I is likely to be correlated to stage\u00a09 (Fig.\u00a05).\n\nThe evolution of these systems was initially defined \nmainly based on geomorphological observations, as \n\nTi\nm\n\ne \n(s\n\n)\n\n0.0\n\n2.0\n\n4.0\n\n6.0\n\nNW SE\n\nComposite sequence boundary\nComposite transgressive surface\nComposite maximum flooding surface\nComposite sequence 0     10             30                                           90 km\n\nFigure 3.

Interpretations \nobtained from main studies summarizing the current under-\nstanding of the Pelotas Basin were integrated with new data, \nincluding geomorphological and topographical mapping, out-\ncrops description, geoprocessing, and GPR records. Remote \nsensing and field data were organized and integrated into \na Geographic Information System (GIS), using ArcGIS\u00a9 \nplatform. Optical images from Landsat 7 and 8, SPOT 5, \nQuickBird and RapidEye, as well as the topographic model \nof Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and ASTER \nSatellite, were the bases of the GIS project. The\u00a0Global \nNavigation Satellite System (GNSS) was utilized to position \nfield data, using the equipment Trimble\u00ae ProXRT (WGS84 \ndatum), and the differential method.\n\nDetailed topographic measurements were performed in \norder to establish the relative position of maximum sea level \nrelated to each system. Altitude measurements were based \non paleo indicators, consisting of the combination of sedi-\nmentary structures generated on the beach face, the occur-\nrence of Ophiomorpha ichnofossils, and the vertical facies \nsuccession. As\u00a0discussed by many authors (Frey et\u00a0al. 1978; \nTomazelli et\u00a0al. 1982; Pollard et\u00a0al. 1993; Gibert et\u00a0al. 2006), \nOphiomorpha nodosa forms a complex 3D structure that can \nbe extend in depth. Vertical shafts with thick-lined, narrower \nand not pelleted burrows correspond to the best indication \nof water-sediment interface (Gibert et\u00a0al. 2006). As\u00a0this fea-\nture was not easily identifiable at the measured outcrops, \nthe combination of Ophiomorpha with sand deposits con-\ntaining low-angle planar cross-stratification was related to \nforeshore. Considering the actual coast is microtidal, with \nsemidiurnal mean range of only 0.5\u00a0m, the maximum alti-\ntudes of Ophiomorpha occurrence and the top of foreshore \ndeposits were leveled, resulting in the minimum highest \nsea-level position for each evaluated system. The\u00a0altitudes \nare considered the minimum in view of possible erosion.\n\nThe altitude of the paleo sea levels in each locality were \nreferenced to the mean low tide determined by the tide gauge \nof Imbituba vertical datum, which is considered today\u2019s zero \nsea level along the Brazilian margin. Two methods were used \nto perform this reference: trigonometric leveling and satellite \npositioning. In\u00a0System II, topography measurements were \ncarried out in the southern region of the coastal plain, where \nit is well preserved (Fig.\u00a06). Leveling was based on a reference \ngiven by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics \n(IBGE\u00a0\u2014 RN1968U) at an altitude of 13.6217\u00a0m, and \nthe stations were leveled with a Zeiss Elta 50 Total Station. \nDifferential GNSS measurements were performed for the \nsame type of features of Systems\u00a0II and III. The\u00a0model applied \n\nto convert ellipsoidal to geoidal altitude is MAPGEO2010, \nprovided by the IBGE.\n\nThe GPR profiles were collected with a GSSI\u2122 (Geophysical \nSurvey Systems, Inc.) SIR-3000 with antennas of 200, 400\u00a0MHz \n(monostatic\u00a0\u2014 GSSI\u2122), 80 and 124\u00a0MHz (Subecho SE-70 \nand SE-150 bistatic \u2014 Radarteam Sweden AB). The\u00a0GPR \nsystem was connected to the GNSS allowing the topographic \npositioning of the survey. The\u00a0data were acquired in the com-\nmon offset method, with 32\u00a0stacks for each trace to improve \nthe signal-to-noise ratio, and varying the depth of investiga-\ntion according to the penetration from about 300 to 1,000\u00a0ns \nof two-way travel time (TWTT). Considering the dielectric \nconstant for sand (10), representing a velocity of 0.09\u00a0m/ns \n(Davis &amp; Annan 1989), the depth of investigation ranged \nfrom about 15 to 45\u00a0m. This dielectric constant was vali-\ndated using lithological data obtained from SPT drill holes \n(Dillenburg et\u00a0al. 2011). Trace stacking, frequency and gain \nfilters were applied during the collection to reduce noise and \nenable real time data viewing. The\u00a0records were post-processed \nwith the software packages Radan\u2122, Reflex Win\u00ae and Prism \n2\u00ae. Data processing comprised time-zero adjustment, back-\nground removal, band-pass frequency filters, gain equaliza-\ntion, time-to-depth conversion, and topographic corrections. \nA\u00a0total of 220\u00a0km of GPR data were obtained in both dip \nand strike directions, along Systems\u00a0II, III and IV.\n\nThe stratigraphic interpretation was based on the method \nof seismostratigraphy (Payton 1977). The\u00a0method was based \non termination (onlap, downlap, toplap and truncations), \ngeometry and pattern of the reflections to interpret units \nand surfaces (Mitchum Jr. et\u00a0al. 1977; Vail et\u00a0al. 1977; Neal \n2004; Catuneanu 2002; Catuneanu et\u00a0al. 2009; Abreu et\u00a0al. \n2010; Barboza et\u00a0al. 2009, 2011). GPR units are determined \nbased on its internal configuration and geometry, allowing \nthe definition of radarfacies and packages. The\u00a0main radar-\nfacies and its interpretation related to the depositional envi-\nronment are well defined for the coastal plain of Pelotas \nBasin (Barboza et\u00a0al. 2009, 2011).\n\nThe radiocarbon ages mentioned in this paper are related \nto the evolution of System IV, resulting from the works of \nTomazelli et\u00a0al. (1998, 2008), Dillenburg et\u00a0al. (2004, 2006, \n2007), Travessas et\u00a0al. (2005), and Silva (2011). The\u00a0samples \nwere collected in standard penetrating test (SPT) cores and \noutcrops, and analyzed by Beta Analytic Inc., corresponding \nto six mollusk shell samples, one piece of wood, one sam-\nple of root and one sample of organic sediment (Table\u00a01).\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe applied methods resulted in the information \nthat allowed characterizing the barrier-lagoon systems. \n\n190\nBrazilian Journal of Geology, 47(2): 183-207, June 2017\n\nHigh-Frequency Sequences in the Pelotas Basin Quaternary\n\n\n\nNorthern Profile\nNW SE\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n0          5         10       15       20        25       30       35        40        45      50        55       60        65       70        75       80 km\n\nSystem I System II System III System IV\n\nLag I\n\nBarrier I\n\nLagoonal II\nBarrier II\n\nLag III\nBarrier III\n\nLag IV\nBarrier IV\n\nSouthern Profile\nNW SE\n\nSystem II System IIISystem IV System IV\n\nLagoonal II/III\n\nLagoonal III\n\nLagoonal IV\nLagoonal IV\n\nBarrier II\nBarrier III\n\nBarrier IV\n\nUnit\n\nBarrier I \u2013 BI \n\nBarrier II \u2013 BII\n\nBarrier III \u2013 BIII\n\nBarrier IV \u2013 BIV\n\nAltitude of paleo\nsea-level indicators (m)\n\nAltitude (m)\n600\n\n0 0       25     50 km\n\nN\n\n24\n\n16\n\n8\n\n0\n0                                  5                                  10                                15                                20                                 25 km\n\nFigure 6.

(2008)\n\nThe\u00a0geomorphological analysis allows distinguishing the \nmain units which compose the coastal plain: barriers and \nlagoons. Barriers can achieve altitudes of almost 30\u00a0m, with \nthe exception of Barrier\u00a0I, which is almost 100\u00a0m high in \nthe north of the coastal plain in response of aeolian cover-\ning of the bedrock. Barriers have undulating surfaces related \nto aeolian activity in contrast with lagoonal features, which \nare plan or composed of distinguishing elongate curved spits \n(Fig.\u00a06). As\u00a0barriers are higher, dryer and mainly composed \nof sand, they tend to appear brighter in comparison with \nlagoonal deposits, and are easily to discriminate in remote \nsense images.\n\nTopographic profiles from System I to IV show that \ntogether they are at progressively lower altitudes (Figs.\u00a05 \nand 6). Outcrops measurements allowed defining the alti-\ntudes of paleo sea level along Barriers\u00a0II and III, which \nhave good exposures along the coastal plain. In\u00a0the south \n\nof the coastal plain, the top of the beach and the base of the \naeolian deposits of System II resulted in altitudes ranging \nfrom 8.1 to 9.5\u00a0m, with a maximum altitude of 8.3\u00a0m for \nOphiomorpha occurrence (Fig.\u00a07).\n\nFor System III, in the southern of the coastal plain, \nOphiomorpha occurrence has a maximum altitude of 3.6\u00a0m \nand the top of foreshore is at 4.2\u00a0m. On\u00a0the north coast, the \nmeasurements of these ichnofossils vary from 5 to 7\u00a0m of \naltitude, and the top of foreshore is at 7.2\u00a0m. In\u00a0another out-\ncrop on the north coast, also related to System\u00a0III, Tomazelli \nand Dillenburg (2007) measured two different levels on the \ntop of Ophiomorpha occurrence, one of 5.1 and other of \n7.7\u00a0m, where the top of foreshore is at 8.0\u00a0m. As\u00a0mentioned \nin the methods section, the combination of Ophiomorpha \nwith sedimentary structures, and the vertical facies succes-\nsion allowed for the interpretation of the closest position of \npaleo sea level. The\u00a0measurements performed for this work \n\nFigure 7. Example of sedimentary structures generated on the beachface (foreshore and upper shoreface) and the \noccurrence of Ophiomorpha ichnofossils. The combination of these indicators was measured to obtain minimum \npaleo \u201czero\u201d sea-levels highs.\n\n192\nBrazilian Journal of Geology, 47(2): 183-207, June 2017\n\nHigh-Frequency Sequences in the Pelotas Basin Quaternary\n\n\n\nand those of Tomazelli and Dillenburg (2007) resulted in the \nminimum sea-level altitudes related to highstands of 9.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 \nand 8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0m for Barrier\u00a0II and III, respectively.\n\nSystem IV indicators of paleo sea level are related to \ngeomorphological features, as lagoonal terraces (Barboza &amp; \nTomazelli 2003), and the foreshore/shoreface position along \nstrandplains, observed at outcrops, drill holes and GPR pro-\nfiles (Barboza et\u00a0al. 2009, 2011). As\u00a0System\u00a0IV has the most \nstudied stratigraphic record of the coastal plain, and sea-level \nhistory during Holocene is quite well known we did not per-\nformed new measurements in this work. Barrier\u00a0IV was stud-\nied in detail by Dillenburg et\u00a0al. (2000, 2009), Dillenburg \nand Barboza (2014) and Hesp et\u00a0al. (2005, 2007), which \ndistinguished three main morphological barrier types: relict \ndunefields, active dunefields or a complex foredune ridges, \nand dunefields combination. The morphological types of \nBarrier\u00a0IV are related to the stratigraphic stacking found in \nGPR data (Rosa 2012; Barboza &amp; Rosa 2014).\n\nGPR interpretation resulted in the definition of radar-\nfacies correlated with depositional systems (Table\u00a02 and \nFigs.\u00a08 to 11). According to radarfacies relations, there are \nthree main patterns defined: retrogradational, aggradational \nand progradational (Figs.\u00a08 to 11). The\u00a0retrogradational \nstacking is characterized by reflections dipping landwards \n(Barboza et\u00a0al. 2011; Rosa 2012; Lima et\u00a0al. 2013; Silva \n2011, 2015; Dillenburg &amp; Barboza 2014). Radarfacies are \nrelated to lagoonal deposits covered by aeolian, backshore, \nforeshore and shoreface deposits (Figs.\u00a08 and 9). Usually, \nretrogradational pattern is associated with barrier morphol-\nogy of dunefields. In\u00a0some GPR sections, it is possible to \nrecognize the maximum shoreline transgression (Barboza \net\u00a0al. 2011) where backshore and foreshore reflections reach \nits landward most position (Fig.\u00a09). \n\nSeaward, in some sectors of the coastal plain, prograda-\ntional stacking is observed and characterized by continuous \nsets of beach and marine deposits (Figs.\u00a09 and 10). In\u00a0the \nGPR sections, progradational staking is composed by radar-\nfacies related to aeolian, backshore, foreshore and shoreface \ndeposits, forming a set of reflections dipping seaward (Silva \net\u00a0al. 2010; Barboza et\u00a0al. 2011; Rosa 2012; Dillenburg &amp; \nBarboza 2014). Barrier morphology is mostly represented \nby strandplains, with complex foredune ridges and dune-\nfield combination (Dillenburg et\u00a0al. 2000, 2009; Hesp et\u00a0al. \n2005, 2007; Martinho et\u00a0al. 2008, 2010). The\u00a0third pat-\ntern is defined as aggradational, with parallel to subparal-\nlel horizontal reflections related to aeolian deposits, where \nthe barrier morphology is mainly of dunefields (Rosa 2012; \nDillenburg &amp; Barboza 2014).\n\nThe definition of stacking based on reflection configura-\ntion and radarfacies succession allowed identifying the main \ninternal and bounding surfaces. Each barrier-lagoon system \n\n(II, III and IV) is separated by unconformities, represent-\ning a depositional sequence characterized by a conformable \nsuccession of strata. The\u00a0architectural pattern of Systems II, \nIII and IV is mostly the same. Thus, as the work done in \nSystem\u00a0IV is so detailed and GPR data has a much better \nquality, and because System\u00a0IV is less affected by digenesis, \nits understanding was used to guide the interpretation of \nSystems\u00a0II and III.\n\nThe determination of retrogradational, aggradational, \nprogradational and degradational stacking allowed defin-\ning the transgressive and the highstand/falling stage system \ntracts packages (Figs.\u00a08 to 10). The\u00a0lowstand system tract was \nonly recognized into an incised-valley related to System\u00a0IV, \nstudied by Tomazelli et\u00a0al. (2008), and the degradational \nstacking (also known as falling-stage, or forced regression) \nwas not separated from the highstand system tract because of \ndata resolution. Dillenburg et\u00a0al. (2017) (in press), studying \nBarrier IV in the southern portion of the coastal plain, were \nable to separate highstand and falling-stage systems tracts.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn order to contextualize the coastal plain record, we \nsummarized current stratigraphic understanding of Pelotas \nBasin in a hierarchical scheme. Figure\u00a011 and Table\u00a03 show \na summary of published data used to build the proposed \nhierarchy. Major phases of basin filling are defined as Rift, \nPost-rift and Drift (Fig.\u00a02, Table\u00a03\u00a0\u2014 Low), with the two \nlater phases subdivided into transgressive, aggradational, and \nregressive intervals, which, according to Abreu et\u00a0al. (2010), \ninclude four composite sequences (Fig.\u00a03, Table\u00a03\u00a0\u2014 Low \nand Medium). Each composite sequence is divided into \nthree sequence sets, resulting in 12 sequence sets for the \nbasin (Fig.\u00a03). The\u00a0last sequence set (APD4) encloses eight \ndepositional sequences (Fig.\u00a03). \n\nStarting from the interpretation of seismic sections of \nPelotas Basin, it is possible to define that the geological \nrecord of the coastal plain is part of a depositional sequence \ndefined by Abreu (1998) (number 43 of his work) with about \n0.5\u00a0My. The\u00a0integration of surface and subsurface data leave \nto interpret that this sequence is in fact composed of high-\ner-frequency sequences, partially represented by each bar-\nrier-lagoon system (Table\u00a03\u00a0\u2014 High\u00a0I). \n\nThe onshore record of each system was associated by \nVillwock and Tomazelli (1995) to high sea levels, related to \noxygen isotope stages from Imbrie et\u00a0al. (1984).

(2014). The\u00a0minimum highest sea-level \naltitude estimated to System\u00a0II is 9.5 \u00b1 1\u00a0m, to System\u00a0III \nis 7.7 \u00b1 1\u00a0m, and to System IV is 3 \u00b1 1\u00a0m. Rohling et\u00a0al. \n(1998) and Rabineau et\u00a0al. (2006) established magnitudes \nof lowstands to the past 500\u00a0kyr. Considering the correla-\ntion with oxygen isotope stages to determine the age of \nsequences lowstand, it is possible to determine that sea level \nwas more than 100\u00a0m below its current position during each \nlowstand (Fig.\u00a05).\n\nAnalyzing the magnitude of sea-level changes and the \ntime of formation of each system, it is possible to interpret \n\nthat expressive and regional unconformities were formed \nby exposition, erosion and non-deposition, bounding the \nrelated sequences. Considering the maximum measured paleo \nindicator of sea-level position as the minimum altitude of \nthe zero shoreline at the time of deposition of each system, \nand the age control, Systems\u00a0II to IV together are progra-\ndational and are at progressively lower altitudes, resulting \nin a degradational architecture.\n\nInternally, each sequence at the onshore portion of the \nbasin is formed by the record of depositional environments \ndisposed in retrogradational, aggradational, progradational \nand degradational stacking (Figs.\u00a08 to 12).

Sequence boundary is attested to sedimentary \nfeatures interpreted as Barrier III deposits obtained in the drill holes (Silva, 2011 and Dillenburg et al. 2007). \nSections locations are outlined on the map in Figure 4.\n\n(Boyd et\u00a0al. 1989; Saul et\u00a0al. 1999; Carter &amp; Naish 1998; \nYoo &amp; Park 2000; Morton et\u00a0al. 2000; Blum &amp; Carter \n2000; Blum et\u00a0al. 2002; Abbott et\u00a0al. 2005; Blum &amp; Aslan \n2006; Parham et\u00a0al. 2007; Riboulot et\u00a0al. 2012; Amorosi \net\u00a0al. 2016). However, the time of sequence formation and \nits record vary according to the factors controlling their evo-\nlution. Studies developed in New Zealand, where the record \nis strongly influenced by tectonics, identified the occurrence \nof sequences with frequencies of 41 and 100\u00a0kyr developed \nduring the Pliocene and Quaternary (Naish &amp; Kamp 1997; \nCarter &amp; Naish 1998; Saul et\u00a0al. 1999; Abbott et\u00a0al. 2005). \nIn\u00a0the Golf Coast (USA), sea-level changes are responsible \nby the formation of Quaternary sequences related to upper \nPleistocene and Holocene (Blum et\u00a0al. 2002; Blum &amp; Aslan \n2006). Studying the coastal plain and incised-valleys, Blum \net\u00a0al. (2002) e Blum &amp; Aslan (2006) defined depositional \nsequences related to the 100\u00a0kyr cycles, composed by low-\nstand, transgressive, highstand and regressive systems tracts. \n\nSequences formed in response to 100\u00a0kyr are identified as \nwell in Eastern Niger submarine delta (Riboulot et\u00a0al. 2012), \n\nIn North Carolina, Parham et\u00a0al. (2007) studied a drain-\nage system and detected nine depositional sequences filling \nan incised-valley with ages younger than 140\u00a0ka, conclud-\ning that multiple sea-level oscillations occurred during this \ntime or the area must be influenced by glacial isostatic uplift \nand subsidence.\n\nThe coastal plain of Pelotas Basin is located in the tec-\ntonic context of a passive margin, thus its evolution must \nbe mostly influenced by sea-level changes. As\u00a0its record is \nwell correlated to oxygen isotope curves, and higher fre-\nquency sea-level oscillations are predicted in these curves, \nthey could be recorded in the offshore portion of the basin, \nas well as a factor influencing onshore deposition. However, \nthe data analyzed allow establishing only the influence of \n100\u00a0kyr glacioeustatic cycles to form the studied deposi-\ntional sequences.\n\n196\nBrazilian Journal of Geology, 47(2): 183-207, June 2017\n\nHigh-Frequency Sequences in the Pelotas Basin Quaternary\n\n\n\nA\n\nB\n\nm 0              20              40             60              80             100            120            140            160            180           200\n\nSeaward \u2013 SENW \u2013 Landward\n\nA\nlt\n\nit\nu\n\nde\nA\n\nlt\nit\n\nu\nde\n\n6\n\n3.5\n\n1\n\n-1.5\n\n-4\n\n-6.5\n\nm 0                               20                              40                             60                              80                            100\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\nAeolian\n\nFigure 10.

Nevertheless, in Central \nPatagonia (Argentina), Pappalardo et\u00a0al. (2015) measured \nsimilar coastal landforms (beach ridges, marine terraces and \nriver mouth terraces) correlating its age to marine isotope \nstages 1, 5, 7, 9 and 11. The\u00a0authors attributed the eleva-\ntion of landforms to sea-level rises combined with tectonic \nuplifts, with rates varying from 0,016 to 0,067\u00a0m/kyr. \nDespite uplifts is not proved for the coastal plain of Pelotas \nBasin, a tectonic influence in its sedimentary record is not \ndiscarded, especially for the older deposits.\n\nSystem IV\nAs previously discussed, Barrier III is interpreted as related \n\nto oxygen isotope stage\u00a05 (125\u00a0ka) and has a sea-level posi-\ntion up to 7\u00a0m higher than current sea level based on the \nrecord of beach outcrops (Tomazelli &amp; Dillenburg 2007; \nRosa 2012). The oxygen isotope record shows a continuous \ntrend of falling sea level starting in stage\u00a05 until the Last \nGlacial Maximum (LGM) at about 20\u00a0ka. In\u00a0the LGM, sea \nlevel is interpreted to have been situated at around 120 to \n130\u00a0m below the current position (Fairbanks 1989; Corr\u00eaa \n\n1995; Peltier &amp; Fairbanks 2006). After the LGM, sea level \nrose at a fast rate. Along the Brazilian margin, sea level is \ninterpreted to have exceeded the present level around 7.7 to \n6.9\u00a0ka, reaching its maximum at approximately 5.6\u00a0ka (Martin \net\u00a0al. 1979; Angulo &amp; Lessa 1997; Bezerra et\u00a0al. 2003; Caldas \net\u00a0al. 2006; Angulo et\u00a0al. 2006). In\u00a0Rio Grande do Sul, sea \nlevel is estimated to have reached from 2 to 4\u00a0m above the \ncurrent level (Barboza &amp; Tomazelli 2003; Dillenburg et\u00a0al. \n2000, 2009). Since then, it would have started to fall again \nuntil it reaches the present level (Angulo &amp; Lessa 1997; \nAngulo et\u00a0al. 2006).\n\nThe formation of System IV is intrinsically related to sea-\nlevel changes already described (Table\u00a03\u00a0\u2014 High\u00a0II). Coeval \nfluvial and estuarine deposits are present in the coastal plain \nof Rio Grande do Sul (Tomazelli et\u00a0al. 2008; Weschenfelder \net\u00a0al. 2005, 2014). Tomazelli et\u00a0al. (2008) detailed the evo-\nlution of an incised valley in the area of Taim Swamp and \nMirim Lagoon, located in the south region of the coastal \nplain (Fig.\u00a04). Gravimetry and magnetometry (Rosa et\u00a0al. \n2009), seismic, GPR profiles, cores and sedimentological \nanalysis were integrated to understand the geometry and the \nfill of the valley.

The valley was \ncompletely filled during the Holocene, represented today \nby a swamp.\n\nThe base of this incised valley was defined as a sequence \nboundary by Tomazelli et\u00a0al. (2008), separating System \nIII from the valley deposits. This unconformity was inter-\npreted by these authors as the sequence boundary formed \nas a consequence of the LGM. Roots from drill hole indi-\ncate 14C ages of 19,550\u201319,270\u00a0cal\u00a0yrs BP to the base of \nvalley (Tomazelli et\u00a0al. 2008). The\u00a0lowstand system tract is \ninterpreted to be related to the basal portion of the valley \nand to paleosoils and other continental correlated deposits \nbeyond the coastal plain (Tomazelli et\u00a0al. 2008; Rosa 2012). \nAtop the lowstand valley deposits, the transgressive surface \nis interpreted by the differentiation of filling architecture \npatterns in GPR and seismic profiles, associated to sedimen-\ntological changes (Fig.\u00a013). Into the valley, the transgres-\nsive system tract is characterized by lateral accretion, related \nto the evolution of channel bars disposed in aggradational \nstaking. Fluvial channel deposits are characterized by a high \ncontent of coarse sand. Mud lenses and biodetritical gravel \nare present too. To\u00a0the top, estuarine and lagoon deposits \nwere interpreted, and shells of reworked mollusks indicate \n14C ages between 8,160\u20137,990 and 6,820\u20136,640\u00a0cal\u00a0yrs BP \n(Tomazelli et\u00a0al. 2008).\n\nThe transgressive system tract is represented in GPR by \nlandward dipping reflections of lagoonal deposits, when \nlagoonal margin migrates landwards (Fig.\u00a08A). During \n\ntransgression, beach face erosion caused sediment trans-\nport from the barrier to the lagoons, mostly through wash-\nover fans and wind. As\u00a0they are below the wave level, these \nfeatures have a higher preservation potential during barrier \ntransgression. In\u00a0this case, the transgressive surface and the \nsequence boundary are merged (Figs.\u00a08A and 9).\n\nThe lagoonal radarfacies are, at some sectors of the \ncoast, covered by the radarfacies of aeolian, backshore, \nforeshore and shoreface deposits, composing retrograda-\ntional parasequences. The\u00a0landward most beach and marine \ndeposits represent the maximum shoreline transgression \nor the maximum flooding surface (Fig.\u00a09). In\u00a0other sectors \nof the coastal plain, the shoreline transgression reached \nthe western continental margin of the paleo lagoons, and \nwave action sculpted scarps in Barrier III. This induced a \nsignificant difference in the record of transgressive system \ntract along the coast, which is represented by thin marine \ndeposits in these sectors.\n\nThe age of maximum flooding surface varies along the \ncoastal plain, and occurred in some sectors even before sea level \nreached its maximum elevation at about 6\u00a0ka. Silva (2011) \nobtained a 14C age of 8,320\u20138,070\u00a0cal\u00a0yrs\u00a0BP for a piece of \nwood from drill hole into the transgressive lagoonal mar-\ngin deposits in the coastal plain of Santa Catarina (Fig.\u00a09A). \nDillenburg et\u00a0al. (2006, 2007) dated preserved shells of marine \nmollusks in foreshore and shoreface deposits positioned at \ndepths of 9 to 12\u00a0m.

Strike seismic section of the incised valley where the sequence boundary is related to the unconformity \nbetween the depositional sequences of Systems III and IV. The valley fill refers to System IV, in which the main \nstratigraphic surfaces and system tracts were interpreted. The location of the section is outlined on the map in Figure 4.\n\nCoastal embayments show a progradational stacking inter-\npreted as the highstand systems tract, represented mostly by dis-\ntinct strandplain morphology (Figs.\u00a09, 10A and 14). Landward, \nthe maximum flooding surface is positioned between the top \nof lagoonal and the base of beach deposits, while seaward it \nis in the shoreface deposits (Fig.\u00a09). In\u00a0most of the lagoons of \nthe coastal plain, scarps were sculpted when the water level \nwas higher in response to the high sea level. These scarps repre-\nsent the continental record of the maximum flooding surface.\n\nSome authors recognized progressive changes in the \nmorphology and altitude of the strandplains, with fore-\ndune ridges narrower and downsteping, and interpreted \nthe transition from normal to forced regression (Silva 2011, \n2015; Dillenburg et\u00a0al. 2006, 2009). According to models \nas the ones of Hunt and Tucker (1992), Helland-Hansen \nand Gjelberg (1994), and Plint and Nummedal (2000), \nthis record could be related to the forced-regressive system \ntract. However, the basal surface of forced regression and \nthe regressive surface of marine erosion are not recognized \nin most of GPR sections and cores. So\u00a0the forced regression \nwas only identified in some studies related to the evolution \nof Barrier IV (Dillenburg et\u00a0al. 2006; Silva 2011, 2015; \nDillenburg et\u00a0al. 2017 in press).\n\nAs already observed by Tomazelli and Villwock (1989), \nDillenburg et\u00a0al. (2000, 2009), Barboza et\u00a0al. (2011), Rosa \net\u00a0al. (2011), Rosa (2012), Dillenburg and Barboza (2014) \nand Barboza and Rosa (2014), the Pelotas Basin shoreline \nhas sectors with different behaviors, with System IV pre-\nsenting synchronous progradational, aggradational and ret-\nrogradational patterns along the coast.\n\nSystem IV shows sectors along the coast with transgres-\nsive shoreline, where GPR record exhibits landward dipping \n\nreflections (Fig.\u00a08A). These sectors are located where the \nshoreline is more projected seaward (Fig.\u00a014). In\u00a0these sec-\ntors, lagoonal mud and peat outcrop in the current beach \nface (Tomazelli et\u00a0al. 1998; Dillenburg et\u00a0al. 2004). 14C dat-\ning of these deposits indicate ages of 6,843\u20136,303\u00a0cal yr BP \n(Travessas et\u00a0al. 2005), 4,252\u20134,641\u00a0cal yr BP (Tomazelli \net\u00a0al. 1998) and 3,551\u20132,888\u00a0cal yr BP (Dillenburg et\u00a0al. \n2004), which imply that the barrier was positioned seaward \nof its present position.\n\nWhere the coastline form embayments, progradational \nstacking is observed in System IV (Fig.\u00a014). In\u00a0these sectors, \nGPR profiles show seaward dipping reflections (Fig.\u00a010A). \nThe strandplains of these areas can reach up to 15\u00a0km width \n(Dillenburg et\u00a0al. 2009; Dillenburg &amp; Barboza 2014). \nAggradational behavior occurs in the transitions between \nthe progradational and retrogradational sectors, mainly posi-\ntioned where shoreline changes its orientation (Dillenburg \n&amp; Barboza 2014).\n\nThe occurrence of different stacking patterns along the \nshoreline is interpreted to be controlled by the interaction of \nlongshore currents and shoreline configuration, establishing \nlocal areas of erosion and deposition (Fig.\u00a014). Main factors \ncontrolling the change in stacking would be wind and wave \naction, shoreline orientation and shelf slope and inner shelf \nbathymetry, as already discussed in previous studies (Toldo \nJr. et\u00a0al. 1999, 2004, 2005; Dillenburg et\u00a0al. 2000, 2009; \nMartinho et\u00a0al. 2009; Silva 2015; Barboza et\u00a0al. 2006, 2011; \nDillenburg &amp; Barboza 2014). These factors influence and \nare recorded in even higher frequency scales, as lagoon level \nchanges (Lagoa dos Patos\u00a0\u2014 300\u00a0yr), increased vegetation in \ndune fields (60\u00a0yr) and shoreline erosion (22\u00a0yr) (Table\u00a03\u00a0\u2013 \nHigh\u00a0III from the studies of Toldo Jr. et\u00a0al. 1999, 2004, \n\n201\nBrazilian Journal of Geology, 47(2): 183-207, June 2017\n\nMaria Luiza Correa da Camara Rosa et al.\n\n\n\nA\n\nB C\n\nD\n\nRelative maximum sea level (about 6 ka)\nMaximum transgression (landward most\nposition \u2013 diachronous)\n\nShoreline trajectories\n\nShoreline position\n\nFigure 14.

As\u00a0already observed in exper-\nimental studies, the signal of autogenic processes may be pre-\nserved in the stratigraphic record (Paola et\u00a0al. 2009; Jerolmack \n\n&amp; Paola 2010; Straub &amp; Esposito 2013; Kim et\u00a0al. 2014). \nIn\u00a0the coastal plain of Pelotas Basin, the variability of the \nshoreline configuration, as well as the characteristics of dep-\nositional systems, is highly influenced by autogenic processes.\n\n202\nBrazilian Journal of Geology, 47(2): 183-207, June 2017\n\nHigh-Frequency Sequences in the Pelotas Basin Quaternary\n\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe performed analysis resulted in a Sequence Stratigraphic \nframework which allowed positioning the Quaternary record \nof the coastal plain of Pelotas Basin in relation to its evolu-\ntion through a Sequence Stratigraphic view. Furthermore, \nthe detailed analysis of System\u00a0IV demonstrated the dia-\nchronous nature of stratigraphic surfaces and systems tracts, \nwhich is related to scale issues and the relation of autogenic \nand allogenic factors controlling the stratigraphic record.\n\nThe coastal plain is mainly formed by barrier-lagoon dep-\nositional systems, here interpreted to represent the preserved, \nonshore portion of depositional sequences (Systems\u00a0II, III \nand IV). GPR and elevation data of the four systems indi-\ncate that they have a degradational stacking corresponding \nto a sequence set prograding and downsteping into the basin \n(Figs.\u00a05 and 6), comprehending a degradational sequence \nset. Stacking and types of deposits are show in four sche-\nmatic dip sections (Fig.\u00a012).\n\nThese sequences are interpreted to be mainly controlled \nby glacioeustatic cycles of about 100\u00a0kyr duration repre-\nsented in oxygen isotope records. Higher frequency sea-\nlevel oscillations were not detected in this studied, but could \n\nbe recorded in the offshore portion of the basin as well as \na factor influencing sedimentation. This record could be \nsearched in future studies.\n\nSystem IV shows the concomitant occurrence of pro-\ngradational and retrogradational stacking along the coast. \nIn some sectors, the maximum flooding surface reached its \nlandward most position between 8 and 5\u00a0ka, with progra-\ndation occurring afterwards associated with the highstand \nsystem tract. In\u00a0other sectors, the stacking pattern is still \nretrogradational and the shore is still under transgression \n(Fig.\u00a014). It\u00a0demonstrates the variability of factors con-\ntrolling the sedimentary record. On\u00a0this scale of analysis, \ncoastal depositional systems behave differently at the same \ntime along strike, demonstrating the importance of auto-\ngenic factors in its evolution.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe authors would like to thank CNPq (Brazilian National \nCouncil for Scientific and Technological Development) \nand ExxonMobil Upstream Research Company for finan-\ncial support.\n\nAbbott S.T., Naish T.R., Carter R.M., Pillans B.J. 2005.
