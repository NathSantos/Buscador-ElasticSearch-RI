But it is also the result of the support from many colleagues on both areas. \n\nTo all the members of the ASP - UP Diliman (Philippines), and especially to Dr. Rebecca Crozier, \n\nbecause without her marvelous coordination labor and valuable advices this thesis would never have \n\nbeen possible. \n\nIn the same context, I need to emphasize the support of Dr. Armand Salvador Mijares, always available \n\nfrom the direction of the ASP, and Drs. Victor Paz and Helen Lewis, whose support to understand the \n\narchaeological site of Ille Cave, which they directed since the beginning of the archaeological project, \n\nwas essential to understand its cultural sequence. \n\nInside the ASP osteology laboratory itself, thanks a lot to my good friend (and best \"bone raider\"!) Sarah \n\nAgatha Villaluz, cause her unconditional support and appreciations, and to Myra Lara and Andrea \n\nDominique Cosalan, because their titanic work organizing the register. \n\nSpecial thanks to Dr. Jesusa Catabui, director from the UP Health Services, because of her interest in \n\nour work, and to all the technicians in the same center, which helped me so much during the X-Ray \n\nanalysis of some of the samples studied for the present work. \n\nAlso, as part of my personal experience in Manila, thanks a lot to Isaac Morales Boral and his marvelous \n\nfamily because of their giant help during the first few months and, especially, to Jesus Mari Pe Benito for \n\nbecoming the most supportive person during my stay in the country. MARAMING SALAMAT PO. \n\nI can\u00b4t forget here all the people who treated me so well and taught me so much during my time in Ma\u00e7\u00e3o \n\n(Portugal) and Ferrara (Italy). Thank you all, friends and teachers, and especially thanks to Dr. Luiz \n\nOosterbeek and Dr. Marta Arzarello for their great reception at both institutions, and to the Drs. Eugenia \n\nCunha and Emmanuela Gualdi for creating and helping me to shape this great interest in the human \n\nremains that have come overall to the work that I present here. MUITO OBRIGADO, GRAZZIE MILLE. \n\nMany friends have come and gone in these two years of adventure. But family (though now a little bit \n\nsmaller) has always been supporting from the distance and making sense of my existence in every way, \n\ngiving me strength for all the challenges and opportunities. Thank you, above everyone else.  \n\nAnd thank you, Grandma, for a lifetime of love and advices.

The selected assemblage for the study \n\ncomes from the archaeological site of Ille Cave (Barangay New Ibajay, El Nido), on the island of \n\nPalawan, Philippines. Of the various phases of burials documented on the site, was chosen to focus the \n\nstudy on those from the intensive burial phase (upper layers of the stratigraphic sequence), selecting \n\nindividuals from prehistoric chronologies (Neolithic and Metal Age) and omitting therefore the \n\nindividuals from the contact phase (colonial era). \n\nThis study established gender and age around the death of the 20 individuals selected, in addition to the \n\ndetection of the various diseases suffered by the prehistoric inhabitants of Ille Cave (paleopathologies). \n\nFor this purpose were used basic procedures for sexual diagnosis and age determination, widely used in \n\nforensic studies, as well as the differential diagnosis in the case of the study of diseases present in the \n\nhuman remains. Have been documented various types of diseases (infectious, degenerative, metabolic, \n\ntrauma), both in the various bones composing the skeletons analyzed, as in the various teeth preserved in \n\neach case. Likewise, some markers of occupational stress where registered, related to various functions \n\nperformed by individuals during their lives, and which have enabled to rebuild certain life activities of \n\nthese communities (based on a comparison with other cases from the archaeological literature and \n\nethnographic based studies). \n\nFinally, the comparison of the results with others from various places in Southeast Asia has allowed the \n\ncontextualization of Ille Cave case, which seems to follow similar patterns to those detected in this area. \n\n \n\nRESUMEN. \n\nEl presente trabajo, tesis final del Master Erasmus Mundus en Cuaternario y Prehistoria, se configura \n\ncomo un estudio bioarqueol\u00f3gico llevado a cabo sobre restos esquel\u00e9ticos humanos. La colecci\u00f3n \n\nseleccionada para el estudio procede del yacimiento arqueol\u00f3gico de Ille Cave (Barangay New Ibajay, El \n\nNido), en la isla de Palawan, Filipinas. De las diversas fases de enterramientos documentadas en el sitio, \n\nse ha optado por focalizar el estudio en aquellas procedentes de la fase de enterramientos intensivos \n\n(niveles superiores de la secuencia estratigr\u00e1fica), seleccionando los individuos procedentes de \n\ncronolog\u00edas prehist\u00f3ricas (Neol\u00edtico y Edad de los Metales) y descartando, por tanto, los individuos \n\nprocedentes de la fase de contacto (Era Colonial). \n\nEste estudio ha permitido establecer el sexo y la edad en torno a la muerte de los 20 individuos \n\nseleccionados, adem\u00e1s de recoger observaciones relativas a las diversas enfermedades que sufrieron los \n\nhabitantes prehist\u00f3ricos de Ille Cave (paleopatolog\u00edas).

La raccolta selezionata per lo studio \n\nproviene dal sito archeologico di Ille Cave (Barangay New Ibajay, El Nido), sull'isola di Palawan, \n\nFilippine. Delle varie fasi di sepolture documentati sul sito, ha scelto di concentrarsi nello studio su quelli \n\nprovenienti da fase di sepolture intensivi (livelli superiori della sequenza stratigrafica), selezionando le \n\nindividui da cronologie preistorici (Neolitico ed Et\u00e0 dei Metalli) e scartando quindi, gli individui dalla \n\nfase di contatto (epoca coloniale). \n\nQuesto studio stabilisce sesso ed et\u00e0 intorno alla morte di 20 individui selezionati, in aggiunta alla \n\nraccolta di commento alle malattie che hanno colpito dagli abitanti preistorici di Ille Cave \n\n(paleopatologias). A questo scopo, sono state utilizzate procedure di base per determinare l'et\u00e0 e \n\ndiagnosticare il sesso, ampiamente usato negli studi forensi, cos\u00ec come la diagnosi differenziale nel caso \n\ndello studio di malattie presenti nei resti umani. Sono stati documentati vari tipi di malattie (infettiva, \n\ndegenerativa, metabolica, traumi), sia nei vari ossa qui comporre scheletri analizzati, come nelle varie \n\ndenti conservati in ciascun caso. Allo stesso modo, sono riusciti a identificare alcuni marcatori di stress \n\noccupazionale, in relazione alle diverse funzioni fisiche svolte da individui durante la loro vita, e hanno \n\npermesso di ricostruire alcune attivit\u00e0 di vita di queste comunit\u00e0 (sulla base di un confronto con altri casi \n\ndalla letteratura archeologica e studi di base etnografici). \n\nInfine, il confronto dei risultati con gli altri provenienti da diversi luoghi nel Sud Est Asiatico ha \n\npermesso contestualizzare il caso di Ille Cave, che sembra seguire modelli simili a quelli rilevati in questo \n\nstudio. \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

Much blame it all \n\ncomes from the constant effort of the Department of Prehistory of the university, led by Dr. \n\nRodrigo de Balbin and Dr. Primitiva Bueno Ramirez, both great specialists concerning the \n\narcheology of the Iberian Peninsula (the first on hunter-gatherer societies, and especially in \n\nthe study of Paleolithic art; the second in recent chronologies, megalithic and post-\n\nPaleolithic art specialist) also knew how to instill passion and respect in me for the \n\ndiscipline, through a certainly practical and fun way (annual study tours to archaeological \n\nreference sites, workshops for the study of materials, excavations, etc.). Thanks to them I \n\nended up choosing to focus my studies in prehistory, although my previous interests \n\npointed in other directions (Classical Archaeology, Egyptology, Islamic Medieval). \n\nDuring the Degree I also had the opportunity to acquire various fieldwork skills through \n\nseveral seminars of documentation of rock art and many archaeological campaigns. \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n3 \n \n\nCertainly my first excavation was really important to further define my potential interest: it \n\nwas a necropolis of pit graves from Chalcolithic and Bronze Age periods, situated on the \n\noutskirts of Madrid, and was carried out by a partnership with a company of archeology \n\n(Punto de Encuentro S.L.). In addition to the hardness of the work, I perfectly remember \n\nthe feeling I had when first discovered human remains: the skeleton of a child, apparently \n\nbound and decapitated. In the adjacent pit, anthropologists exposed the remains of an adult \n\nmale in an extended position and covered with multiple beads, forming a colorful necklace. \n\nMy innate passion for the ritual and that first experience made me decide to focus my work \n\non the archeology of death. \n\nAll these experiences led me to continue my studies after the Degree in History by \n\nspecializing in the field of archaeology, which was manifested in the attainment of the \n\nMaster AGEPIPE (Archaeology and Heritage Management at the Inner Iberian Peninsula: \n\n2011-2012) in state institution, during which I was able to do my thesis on ritual contexts of \n\nPrehistory of my region. My work, \"Pit graves from III to II millennia BC in the Inner \n\nIberian Peninsula\", would have been impossible without the invaluable help and direction \n\nof Dr. Rosa Barroso Bermejo, who helped me analyze the funeral phenomenon in the upper \n\nTagus River, in the triangle formed by the provinces of Madrid-Toledo-Guadalajara. \n\nWhile I consider it necessary to continue in my studies for the future (I have in mind my \n\nPhD in the subject), the development of my thesis in AGEPIPE made me consider many \n\nquestions. The main one was \u201cand what happens to the human remains?\u201d My thesis was \n\nfocused on the analysis of materials, structures and spaces, but the fact is that one of my \n\nbiggest gaps after my time in the UAH was directly studying the skeletons themselves. Of \n\ncourse, this would have no place in a C.V. specializing in the study of tombs! Therefore, I \n\ndecided to take some time to think before enrolling in a PhD program, and this time of \n\nreflection materialized in the enrolling for the Erasmus Mundus program which currently \n\nI\u00b4m doing. I had the good fortune to receive, at the end of 2013, a scholarship that allowed \n\nme to participate without major costs in the International Master in Quaternary and \n\nPrehistory. First, because it was a great opportunity to embark on that journey into the \n\nunknown: the study of physical anthropology. Second, I have always considered myself a \n\ntraveling and adventurous person. My first Erasmus, conducted in the fourth year of the \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n4 \n \n\nDegree of History at the Universidade de Coimbra (Portugal), allowed me to understand \n\nhow important it is to study in an international environment, with different ideas and \n\nmethodologies, and of course with different languages. Also, the strong global economic \n\ncrisis in which we find ourselves nowadays is forcing many young people to emigrate from \n\nmy country in search of a better future: so it seemed logical to take advantage of \n\ncircumstances to start looking for projects that were viable for my future. \n\nIt is with this second master that I come face to face with the second field of physical \n\nanthropology. During my stay at the Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico de Tomar and the Museu da arte \n\nPr\u00e9-Hist\u00f3rica e do Sagrado no Vale do Tejo in Ma\u00e7\u00e3o, I had the opportunity to take a \n\ncourse of Bioarcheology and Human Evolution, led by Dr. Eugenia Cunha of the \n\nUniversity of Coimbra, a great specialist in forensic science and great teacher, who knew \n\nhow to guide us precisely in the various theoretical and practical exercises of the course. \n\nMy obsession to learn as much as possible about human bones also led me to participate in \n\nthe laboratory of human osteology of the UP Diliman Archaeological Studies Program \n\n(hereinafter referred to as ASP), led by Dr. Rebecca Crozier, during a stay of four months \n\nin the summer of 2014. Through a month of work with a practical exercise that a priori \n\nmight seem simple (the study of a skeleton in fairly good condition, defining the biological \n\nprofile of the individual), Dr. Crozier got me interested in the secrets hidden behind the \n\nhuman remains increasingly, and made me understand the idea that somehow a deceased \n\nindividual (hundreds of years in this case) could continue giving us really valuable \n\ninformation. This, together with the wonderful personal experiences that I enjoyed during \n\nmy time in the Philippines and the ASP, led me to propose Dr. Crozier as director of my \n\nfuture thesis, which would deal with paleopathologies (even the exact issue was not defined \n\nyet) and could be done by a new stay in the country which would run between January and \n\nAugust 2015. \n\nOverlooking my thesis preparation, I was able to make another mobility between October \n\nand December 2014 in the Universita degli Studi di Ferrara (Italy), where theoretical and \n\npractical studies were useful to me for my future work: a theoretical course on Human \n\nPaleontology and Paleoanthropology, headed by Dr. Carlo Peretto; and two courses, both \n\ntheoretical (Biology of the Human Skeleton) and practical (laboratory of archaeo-\n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n5 \n \n\nanthropology and forensic anthropology), with the recognized italian forensic scientist Dr. \n\nEmmanuela Gualdi. I was able to approach skeletal fragments in state of poor preservation, \n\nanalyzing the pathologies reflected in the remains by comparing them with an extended \n\nreference collection, and also conducting studies of sexual diagnosis, age determination and \n\nstature. \n\nFor these reasons, it is clear that my master's thesis would be framed in the field of \n\nprehistoric archeology, particularly in funerary archeology, and especially in the study of \n\nhuman remains. The availability of Dr. Crozier and the fact that paleopathologies supposed \n\na new path of research for me did the rest to defining the thesis topic which is proposed \n\nbelow (Chapter 1). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n6 \n \n\n \n\n1. INTRODUCTION: THESIS STATEMENT \nAND GOALS. \n\n \n \n\n1.1. DELIMITATION OF THE TOPIC OBJECT OF STUDY. \n\nWhile was clear that the work was going to be focused in the study of a skeletal assemblage \n\nfrom a prehistoric site in the Philippines, now it was time to choose between the various \n\noptions available: which would be the actual bone collection to study or on which build the \n\nproposed study? After several e-mails, Dr. Crozier proposed two different collections \n\namong those from the ASP archive: Catanauan (Quezon, Bondoc Peninsula) or Ille Cave \n\n(New Ibajay, el Nido, Palawan Island). Finally we chose the second case, because of the \n\nbest status of preservation of the collection. \n\nAlthough the following chapters will discuss in detail the archaeological case of Ille Cave \n\n(Chapter 2), it is necessary to provide a brief overview of the phase sequence of the site, as \n\nit was vital to define the topic of final work. As will be seen in Chart 1.1, it was possible to \n\nmake a sufficiently robust analysis of stratigraphy and materials to offer a basic chrono-\n\ncultural sequence, either from some absolute dating or mainly by relative dating of the \n\nvarious layers and archaeological contexts. Chart 1.1 provides a good picture of said \n\nsequence (PAZ, 2012, pp.142-152). As we may deduct from the chronocultural scheme, \n\ntwo different funerary typologies have been observed at Ille Cave: cremations and burials. \n\nSince other teams in the ASP are already focusing their work on cremations (LARA et al., \n\n2013), was decided to eliminate them from the study.  \n\nAs this project was focused on the analysis of prehistoric human remains, a sample of 20 \n\nburials from the earliest phase to the Metal Age phase were selected for study. Thus our \n\nefforts would focus on those first burials, the \"Neolithic\" stage and the period associated \n\nwith metallurgy (marking a wide chronological range from more than 4000 years ago until \n\nc.1000 years ago). The truth is that the stratigraphy of the superior layers is quite chaotic, \n\nand the lack of absolute dating did not facilitate the work in this direction (Chapter 2): was \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n7 \n \n\nquite complicated to put a superior clear limit to the upper layers, in order to distinguish the \n\nlimit between the prehistoric phase and the  \n\n \n\nChart 1.1. CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY OF ILLE CAVE (PAZ, 2012). \n \nCHRONOLOGY CHARACTERISTICS \n\nC.1400-C.9000 Y.A. \n\n \n\nThis phase doesn\u00b4t include any sing of human activity yet (just some wild \n\nanimal remains). \n\nC.9000-C.4000 Y.A. \n\n \n\nThis phase opens the human presence part of the sequence, including the \n\ncremation cemetery. \n\n>4000 Y.A. This phase includes the first two aceramic shell middens and also the first two \n\ninhumations in the sequence: context 874 and 727. \n\nC.4000-C.2000 Y.A. Another shell midden in which the ceramic starts to be present, the inhumation \n\nphenomenon continues. \n\nC.2000-C.1000 Y.A. Metal period sequence: appearance of the metallic implements, lingling-o \n\namulets in jade and shell, more layers of shell midden. \n\nC.1000-C.100 Y.A. Phase of contacts, in which tradeware ceramics (China, Vietnam, Thailand) \n\nstart to be present. Indopacific glass beads in some burials, but the ceramics are \n\nnot associated to them. Colonial influence. \n\n<100 Y.A. Contemporanean populations. \n\n  \n\ncolonial one. That\u2019s why a global analysis will be referred within this chronological \n\nframework, which could include some individuals of transitional moments. \n\nAlso, another researcher from ASP is currently examining the non-adult remains, so the \n\nanalysis will focus in adult individuals, unless the evolution of the work would require us to \n\nexpand the age ratio. \n\nSo then, we can state the thesis which I will present here as a study of the paleopathologies \n\npresent in the adult human remains of prehistoric times (>4000-c.1000 years ago) of Ille \n\nCave (Palawan, Philippines). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n8 \n \n\n1.2. AIMS AND GOALS. \n\nOnce the thesis topic had been decided, it was necessary to outline the goals of the study: \n\n? Assess the evidence for pathological lesions on the prehistoric human remains from \n\nIlle Cave, Palawan. \n\n? Establish a laboratorial procedure that would help us to systematize the approach to \n\neach individual, and also develop a file system (catalogue) which would allow us to \n\nrecord and present the results of our analysis in a clear way. \n\n? Determine the age and sex of each individual. \n\n? The determination of the stature of the individuals is not part of the present study, \n\nsince the preservation status of the assemblage made it impossible (missing or \n\nfragmented epiphysis of the long bones: BUIKSTRA, UBELAKER, 1994, pp.69-\n\n85; WHITE, FOLKENS, 2005, pp.398-400). \n\n? Differential diagnosis of possible pathologies present in the collection to study. \n\n? Establish, if possible, relations between the documented pathologies and other \n\npopulation factors (sex, age, possible activities, lifestyles, etc.) that could allow their \n\nexplanation or understanding in a sociocultural context. Ethnographical resources \n\nwould be really useful to answer this question. \n\n? Establish also frequency relations of these pathologies with the ones present in other \n\ncollections studied in other relevant sites in Southeast Asia. \n\n1.3. THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LITERATURE REVIEW. \n\nAs in any scientific study, specifically of an archaeological nature, before the stage of \n\nlaboratory work (Chapter 3) an investigation of the existing literature is essential: it is \n\nnecessary to understand well the site under study, its chrono-cultural sequence, materials \n\n(not just osteological remains), their contexts (especially the funerary, and considering the \n\nstratigraphic relationship between them, what could allow the development of the said \n\nsequence of phases of Ille). \u201cWhat is known about Ille Cave? What kinds of studies have \n\nbeen conducted? What results have been obtained?\u201d \n\nThe documentary phase was initiated by the exhaustive search of the broadest possible \n\nliterature about the site, its materials, its stratigraphy, dating, etc. Also, for ensuring the \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n9 \n \n\nunderstanding of the contexts in which the burials appear, the graphic documentation \n\nobtained during excavation (photography, drawing, mapping, stratigraphic relationships \n\nexpressed by Harris Matrix, which were kindly provided by Drs. Paz and Lewis) was a \n\ngreat help. \n\nAs for the search of more specific literature, relating to work on human remains issues, \n\nknowledge of the subject by Dr. Crozier was fundamental: her extensive knowledge of \n\nwritten literature on working methods allowed to establish a basic bibliography of \n\nreference, on which later work would allow the location of new references and search for a \n\nmore specific literature (for example, in cases of more specific diseases that were \n\ndocumented during the laboratory analysis of the collection). In that sense, the library of the \n\nASP and the Central Library of the UP Diliman campus offered me all written sources in \n\nrelation to the different aspects of work. Finally, the website of the UP library offered a \n\nvery useful search tool organized by fields, also recurrent for developing own references \n\n(www.ilib.upd.edu.ph). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ilib.upd.edu.ph/\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY. \n\nThe island of Palawan (Philippines), in which the archaeological site of Ille Cave is located \n\nand which location is displayed in Plate 2.1, is part of the Visayas region, and is located on \n\nthe Southwestern part of the archipelago, in the North of Borneo Island. \n\nGeologically speaking, the island can be divided in two main groups (Plate 2.2): the \n\nNorthern part of the main island (together with the Coron group) and the Southern half of it \n\nhave completely different geological characterizations. While the Northern part deposits \n\ncan be characterized as Paleozoic and Mesozoic base deposits, over which the intrusion of \n\nnew materials and alteration of them will play a special roll in some areas (M\u00dcLLER, \n\n1991, pp.121-122); the Southern part of the main island is mainly composed with Cretacic, \n\nTertiary and Quaternary deposits, which suffered different process within can be \n\nhighlighted the intrusion of mafic materials. \n\nNorthern Palawan (Plate 2.3) is constituted mainly by Upper Paleozoic and Lower \n\nMesozoic sediments, which in some regions suffered deformations and metamorphic \n\nprocess during the Early Jurassic era (YUMUL et al., 2009, pp.612). Latter, this geological \n\nsequence suffered different intrusions of plutonic rocks, which caused subsequence \n\noverlain by sediments offshore (Eocene). All the Northern part of the main Palawan Island \n\nand the Calamian group can be defined, according to their composition, as uplifted \n\nbasement limestone and chert. Also, some igneous groups contributed to this complex \n\nsystem with intruder materials in the Kapoas Peninsula, the Ulugan Bay and the Manguao \n\nvolcanic area. \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n12 \n \n\nThe geology of Northern Palawan can also be divided in two main areas (YUMUL et al., \n\n2009, pp.612-613), which separate the complex in two main areas (again N/S) from \n\nCalauag Bay: \n\n? In the Northern part (where Ille Cave site is located: section 2.2), the outcrops of \n\nGuinlo formation overlie the Busuanga formation, consisting in massive quartzose \n\nsandstones with episodes of conglomerates and mudstones. Possibly their origins \n\ncan reach the Middle Permian. El Nido area, in particular, is rich in stunning \n\nlimestone karts towers, such as the one under which Ille Cave is settled. \n\n? In the Southern part, over the Busuanga formation, the Caramay schist complex \n\n(muscovites, schists, quartzs, micas and graphits) and the Conception phyllites \n\n(phyllite mudstones, siltstones, sandstones and met-sediments) form the basement \n\ndeposits, covering almost the entire area. The metamorphic rocks are considered to \n\ncome from the Carboniferous and Permian eras (some of the oldest geological \n\nmaterials in the Philippines). \n\n \n\nPLATE 2.2.

THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE OF ILLE CAVE: STRATIGRAPHICAL \n\nANALYSIS, ABSOLUTE DATAS AND MATERIAL CULTURE. \n\nThe archaeological site of Ille Cave is located in Barangay New Ibajay, El Nido, Northern \n\nPalawan (coordinates: 11 11\u00b4 50\u00b4\u00b4-11 12\u00b4 N, 119 30\u00b4 15\u00b4\u00b4-119 31\u00b4 20\u00b4\u00b4 E. The site is in the \n\nbase of a limestone karts tower (Plate 2.4), in the platform under the rockshelter and both \n\nthe main entrances to the cavity in the karst (designated as North and West Mouths: Plate \n\n2.5). The karst, of about 75 meters height, is located about 5 km. inland from the closest sea \n\nline, the eastern coast of Northern Palawan, at 118 meters above the sea level (PAZ et al., \n\n2013, pp.8-11).  \n\nThe site has been excavated since its discovery in 1998, and has been part of the Palawan \n\nPaleohistoric Research Project which the ASP \u2013 UP Diliman has been carrying out since \n\n2004, together with other archaeological sites in Dewil Valley (PAZ et al., 2013, pp.6). \n\n \n\nPLATE 2.4. Ille karst tower (Archaeological Studies Program). \n\nAs can be observed in the map of Plate 2.6, several trenches have already been opened in \n\nthe archaeological site of Ille (till season 2013, year in which finish the published \n\nliterature). The understanding of their spatial distribution is necessary before approach the \n\nanalysis of the stratigraphical sequence and the main events registered in each trench, \n\nwhich follows. \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

East Mouth trench. \n\nThe origins of this trench, the first one opened by the ASP team in 2004 (together with the \n\nWest Mouth and the Outlier trenches), are in a previous smaller test pit opened in 1999 and \n\nextended in 2002 (when a first group of radiocarbon dating from the upper layers was \n\nobtained, pointing to c.10000 BP, what justified the effort of excavating the site), around \n\nwhich posterior treasure hunter digs where reported (PAZ, RONQUILLO, 2004, pp.11). \n\nThe ASP unified all this preliminary excavations in a bigger trench, which would cover the \n\nentrance area of the East mouth of the cavity, over the external platform. \n\nIn 2004, the team opened a trench of 4.5x3 meters, cleaned the profiles of the treasure \n\nhunter spit and was able to prove the presence of a shell midden layer at around 55 cm. \n\nfrom the surface. Over it, and even cutting it in some cases, the first post-Neolithic \n\ninhumations started to appear (PAZ, RONQUILLO, 2004, pp.11), reaching a number of 24 \n\ncases, with no signs of grave goods. Mixed in the matrix, also the first signs of material \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n17 \n \n\nculture where documented: sherds of earthenware and tradeware (mainly X century China) \n\nceramics, glass beads, stone and shell tools, and even some small metallic rings. \n\nThe excavation in the season of 2005 continued exposing the stratigraphy of the site by \n\nexpanding the sector, in which the same kind of material culture was appearing, and in \n\nwhich another 15 burials where recovered (LEWIS et al., 2006, pp.8-12). Also, this season \n\noffered some interesting absolute dates: 7000-9000 BP for the shell midden and 8000-\n\n10500 BP for some charcoal samples recovered in the levels under it (so, middle Holocene \n\nshell midden and early Holocene in situ burning evidences).  \n\nOne of the highlights of 2005 season was the recovering of the first case of Neolithic burial \n\n(LEWIS et al., 2006, pp.18): the context 727, which appeared at 60-80 cm. depth from the \n\ndatum point. Several grave goods where founded in situ, in clear association with the \n\nburial: a large turbo marmoratus shell close to the left hand, over the chest (possibly was \n\nholding it); a pair of manufactured shell disks (conus sp.) close to the left forearm, plus \n\nanother one in the waist; and a group of smaller shell beads and pig tusks underneath the \n\nforearm disks. The group located close to the forearm was interpreted as a decorative \n\nmanufacture made of the shells and the animal bones (Plate 2.7: LEWIS et al., 2006, pp.18-\n\n19). Although the burial was recovered over the shell midden levels, is possible that it \n\npartially cut them in the feet area. \n\n \n\nPLATE 2.7. Neolithic burial from Ille Cave East Mouth trench, and detail of the ornamental \n\nmanufactured shells (ASP). \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n18 \n \n\nIn the bottom levels excavated in 2005, a new funerary practice was registered for the first \n\ntime beside the inhumations: the first pre-Neolithic cremation (context 758: Plate 2.8), at \n\n130-148 cm. depth (LEWIS et al., 2006, pp.20). The pile of fragmented and burnt bones \n\noverlaid a decayed limestone. Posterior laboratorial analysis where overtaken in this first \n\ncase of cremation (LARA et al., 2013), suggesting that the body was disarticulated and \n\ndefleshed, the cranium smashed and some long bones broken, before being burnt in \n\ndifferent levels and the remains were recovered and put in a container. \n\n \n\nPLATE 2.8. First cremation registered in Ille Cave East Mouth trench (LARA et al., 2013). \n\nUnder the cremation (LEWIS et al., 2006, pp.16), some sterile layer was registered (context \n\n806), under which appeared another one (context 866) which included some lithic \n\nimplements and possible worked animal bones (deer antler). This older phase, \n\nunfortunately, couldn\u00b4t be dated yet by the end of 2005 season, but it\u00b4s study will continue \n\nin following years. \n\nIn 2006, the team reopened the trench at the same levels. This season was profitable from \n\nthe perspective of the funerary archaeology in the cremation cemetery phase, since another \n\nthree cases where recovered from the same levels in which the 2005 cremation was founded \n\n(VV.AA., 2007, pp.13). Also, direct radiocarbon dating over bone samples from the \n\ncremation and of the sediments around it pointed to a data of approximately 9000 BP. At \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n19 \n \n\naround 4.5 meters depth, the excavation continued documenting the sterile levels registered \n\nunder the cremations since the previous season. \n\nThe results of the 2008 excavation season offered another positive result: another two \n\ncremations (context 1358, with an obsidian flake associated, and the smaller context 1370) \n\nin the same level than the previously four cases reported (PAZ et al., 2008, pp.17-18). Also, \n\nthe cultural deposits underneath offered a new date which brought the sequence to dates as \n\nold as 12000 and 14000 BP. \n\n \n\nPLATE 2.9.

East Chamber trench &amp; East Mouth Connection trench. \n\nDuring 2005 season, the ASP direction decided to open a 2x3 meters trench inside the East \n\nchamber of the cavity (LEWIS et al., 2006, pp.30-33). An infant burial (context 783) was \n\nrecovered, as well as similar material culture as the one recovered from other excavation \n\ntrenches (ceramics and porcelains, faunal remains, batissa violacea and neritidae sp. shells) \n\nand some small shell accumulations which possibly come from the same phase of the shell \n\nmiddens. More accumulations of animal bones where recovered during the 2009 season \n\n(PAZ et al., 2009, pp.22). \n\nIn 2009, the connection trench with East Mouth trench was inaugurated. In the following \n\nyear, up to 5 hearths where registered in the same paleosurface (PAZ et al., 2010, pp.19-\n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n21 \n \n\n20). 2011 was interesting for understanding the depositions of accumulations of animal \n\nbones, which where interpreted as the result of a surface flow of water, which dragged the \n\nremains inside the cavity (PAZ et al., 2011, pp.25). \n\nIn 2012, the data of the deeper archaeological context documented in the East Chamber \n\ntrench offered a terminal Pleistocene chronology: 10000-12000 BP (PAZ et al., 2012, \n\npp.32). By the end of next year season, 2013, in which the fluvial and colluvial deposits \n\nwere still been excavated, the trench was closed at the depth of 280 cm. from the datum \n\npoint (PAZ et al., 2013, pp.29). \n\n? 2.2.3. East-West Connection trench.  \n\nSince 2009, the connection trench between the two main trenches of Ile Cave, the ones of \n\nEast and West Mouths, was starting to be excavated. In the first year, three post-Neolithic \n\ninhumations from the intensive burial phase where recovered, together with big \n\naccumulations of tradeware and earthenware ceramics (PAZ et al., 2009, pp.22). \n\n2010 brought in this sector the finding of the 7\nth\n\n cremation documented in Ille (context \n\n2228), together with another inhumation in the upper layers and another lingling-o pendant \n\n(the third in the site made in tridacna sp. shell) which felt down from one of the walls of \n\nthe trench while cleaning (PAZ et al., 2010, pp.21). Also, a paleosurface with another \n\npossible hearth was registered. \n\nIn 2012, the excavation in this trench continued, and was possible to document another \n\npaleosurface with some possible post holes. Also, the first inhumation in flexed position in \n\nthe site (context 2240) was recovered (PAZ et al., 2012, pp.41-42). Portions of the shell \n\nmidden where already being exposed by the end of 2013 season, when the trench was \n\nclosed at a depth of approximately one meter (PAZ et al., 2013, pp.30). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

The \n\nexcavated area, of around 3.5x2.5 meters, arrived to a depth of 2.3 meters from the datum \n\npoint by the end of this first season, in which post-Neolithic levels where documented. The \n\nmain events registered in the stratigraphy where some burials of the upper layers (total of 8, \n\ncounting the ones from the previous test pits, without grave goods: Plate 2.14), a rock fall \n\n(at which level the previous year test pits stopped) and the first cases of hearths \n\ndocumented in the site (PAZ, RONQUILLO, 2004, pp.12). About the material culture, \n\nmixed with the fills of the burials, where recovered different materials: shells (highlighting \n\nsome fragments of tridacna sp.), pottery sherds (native and imported) and numerous glass \n\nand shell beads (including lingling-o and a piece of a shell bracelet). \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

Some metallic \n\nimplements (mainly copper implements in 2006, iron fractured blades and some punctual \n\ncases of gold rings in 2006) were also documented. About the ceramics, the recovery of \n\nseveral fragments of big jars (Sa Huynh-Kalanay type), normally used for jar burials, \n\ncomplicated the interpretation of the site. Nowadays there are still no proves of a jar burial \n\ncemetery in Ille Cave, although it exist the possibility that where surface votive offerings \n\nthat got fragmented and mixed with the backfill sediment of the burials (LEWIS et al., \n\n2006, pp.24). Also, under the burial layers, ceramic materials continued appearing (now \n\nascribed to Neolithic typologies), as well as faunal remains and lithic implements. But the \n\nhighlight discovery of these seasons was the intentional burial of a dog, an interesting \n\nmarker of animal domestication (LEWIS et al., 2006, pp.26). \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

Together with it was observed the presence of a level of aceramic \n\nshell midden, underlying the upper one (Plate 2.17). Also, another special inhumation \n\n(context 874) was recovered under a stone marker (which the directors of the excavation \n\ninterpreted as a \u201cboat-shaped marker\u201d: PAZ, 2012, pp.144), covered by red pigment and \n\nwhich had two big melo sp. shells on the right chest and a necklace of conus sp. and \n\nmonkey teeth (Plate 2.18). \n\n  \n\nPLATE 2.16.

West Mouth Connection trench. \n\nOpened for the first time in 2007, for connecting the West Mouth and the Outlier trenches. \n\nAs expected, several human remains where recovered also in the upper layers of the \n\nstratigraphy, as part of the post-Neolithic inhumation cemetery (VV.AA., 2007, pp.13). The \n\ntrench, of 1x4 meters, arrived at 120 cm. depth at the end of its first excavation season \n\nwithout any other particular finding, furthermore the materials observed in the main \n\ntrenches for this phase. \n\n? 2.2.6. West Mouth West Extension trench. \n\nOpened in 2008 for avoiding the collapse of the West Mouth trench. During this season, the \n\nstratigraphy followed the organization of the West Mouth: upper layers which mixed \n\ndifferent materials (where the first lingling-o made on green mica was recovered, together \n\nwith the typical materials ascribed for this period shown in other trenches) with some post-\n\nNeolithic inhumations and the starting of the shell midden layers, where the excavation \n\nstopped (PAZ et al., 2008, pp.15-16). During the next seasons, similar burials and materials \n\nwhere registered in the deeper layers (PAZ et al., 2012, pp.46). By the close of 2013 \n\ncampaign, the depth of the trench was in 62-77 cm. from the datum point (PAZ et al., 2013, \n\npp.27). \n\n? 2.2.7.

The trench, of \n\n2x2 meters, reached a depth of around 125 cm. Up to three post-Neolithic burials where \n\ndiscovered at around 60 cm. depths, one of them (context 69/77) specially interesting \n\nbecause of preserving some Indo-Pacific beads in situ. At the depth of almost a meter, an \n\naccumulation of pig bones where founded under a rock, presumably covered with hematite. \n\nTradeware and earthenware ceramic sherds where founded in all the archaeological levels, \n\nwhich corresponded with the ones documented in the West Mouth trench.  \n\n \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

THE CHRONO-CULTURAL SEQUENCE OF ILLE CAVE. \n\nThanks to the study of the stratigraphy registered in the several open trenches in the site of \n\nIlle Cave, the chrono-cultural sequence of phases has been defined as follows (PAZ et al., \n\n2009, pp.41-43): \n\nA. Current phase (Late XIX century \u2013 Present). Remains of the ancestors of the \n\ncurrent inhabitants of El Nido for the last c.100 years. Agricultural-based cultures \n\n(cereal). XX century material culture. \n\nB. Ritual intensification phase (c.2000 years ago - late XIX century). Presence of \n\nburials (Neolithic-Contact phase). Funerary practice: inhumations, oriented to SW, \n\nno grave goods associated. Possible secondary burials associated with jars (first \n\nearthenware, latter tradeware ceramics -evidence of contact with mainland Asia-), \n\nnot buried but deposited in the cavity. Possibly the different rituals correspond to \n\ndifferent cultures and timing. \n\nC. Dominantly habitation phase (c.6000-c.2000 years ago). Middle Holocene shell \n\nmiddens and hearth deposits (which include remains of food consumed) justify the \n\nuse of the place as a campsite, or perhaps more permanent habitation area. Funerary \n\npractice: inhumations, oriented to NE, associated grave goods (hammer stones and \n\nshells -manufactured or not-). Possible secondary burials, ossuaries. \n\nD. Non-pottery habitation phase (c.8000-c.6000 years ago). Shell middens which \n\njustify the habitation. No signs of ceramic technology, but strong presence of shell \n\nutilization. Possibly the boat-marked burial belongs to this phase. \n\nE. Habitation and cremation cemetery phase (c.10000-c.8000 years ago). Funerary \n\npractice: cremations. Presence of animal remains, not yet domesticated. Signs of a \n\ndifferent landscape that the one shown in earlier phases: remains of tiger, deer, \n\nestuarine shells (dryer and more open, not so much vegetation, grass extensions). \n\nF.

THE INVENTORY OF HUMAN REMAINS AND THE FINAL STUDY \n\nASSEMBLAGE. MINIMAL NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS (MNI). \n\nBefore we began the study of the human remains of Ille Cave, it was necessary to define \n\nwhich part of the extensive collection of skeletons should focus the analysis. The initial \n\nidea was to study the prehistoric populations of Ille after the earlier burials, as introduced in \n\nthe Chapter 1 \u2013 Chart 1.1 (including these first cases). This would immediately exclude two \n\ngroups of funerary contexts clearly represented in the stratigraphy: \n\n? The cremation cemetery (7 cases, lower levels of stratigraphy): made sense to omit \n\nin our study, since other investigators from ASP focused their analysis on them \n\n(LARA et al., 2013). \n\n? The phase of burials of colonial times (higher levels, part of the phase of intensive \n\nburials): was omitted here because the aim of this study is to analyze the \n\npopulations previous to the Spanish contact phase. \n\nIn order to omit this cases, the official ASP-UP Diliman inventory of human remains from \n\nthe site was used as a primary source, which has been developing and changing in recent \n\nyears by the team of archaeologists from Palawan, and which consultation was provided to \n\nus from the ASP itself. The inventory consists of a list of archaeological contexts including \n\nhuman bones, as well as detailed information about the anatomical parts represented and \n\ninitial results of sexing and age determination in some individuals (although our work \n\nincluded both aspects as part of the process of our own analysis approach). \n\nThe case of the discard of the colonial individuals was somehow more complex: the \n\nstratigraphy of the upper levels of Ille Cave, as we saw in the previous chapter, offers \n\nconsiderable interpretative problems, given the chaotic organization of the strata due to \n\nintense funerary activity for a long period of time and the lack of absolute chronologies \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n33 \n \n\nfrom skeletal contexts. Current understanding of the phasing derives from the interpretation \n\nof the various archaeological materials, as well as the composition of documented strata \n\nand their stratigraphic relationships, leading to a process of relative dating (for example: \n\ncomparative chronologies with what we have before or after inside this sequence). \n\nIn that sense, the assistance of Dr. Helen Lewis, co-director of the archaeological site of Ille \n\nCave, was essential. Responsible for preparing the complex Harris Matrix, Dr. Lewis \n\nknows better than anyone the stratigraphy of Ille, and was able to isolate a number of \n\nindividuals who definitely belonged to what is referred as the colonial phase. Thanks to that \n\nlist of individuals we solve, at least partially, the problems of chronocultural definition of \n\nour study. \n\nBeyond this, our study sought to focus attention on adult individuals, since other specialists \n\nin the ASP are currently working on non-adult remains. Therefore, and based on the \n\ninformation in the inventory and Harris Matrix, the group of non-adults was also omitted. \n\nIn the table below, we can see all individuals omitted in the study (Chart3.1), as well as the \n\nreason for the dismissal: \n\n \n\nChart 3.1.

It was hard to define which of them \n\nall exactly belong to the prehistoric or pre-colonial phase, and which of them would come \n\nfrom a transition phase to the new cultural and economic models. The analysis of \n\nassociated materials doesn\u00b4t gave us too much information, as many skeletons didn\u00b4t appear \n\ndirectly associated with material culture, but a priori the premise showed valid until a \n\nbetter definition of the cultural sequence of Ille Cave. \n\nIn any case, the MNI (minimum number of individuals) represented in this assemblage \n\nselected for the study is 20: it coincides with the number of contexts selected, since was \n\nnoticed that every craft associated to each context contented the human remains of a \n\nseparate individual, without any bone which could point to the presence of more individuals \n\nmixed in the assemblage (in this sense the human remains where well organized in the ASP \n\nbefore the start of the project). \n\n3.2. STARTING LABORATORIAL PROCEEDINGS. CLEANUP OF HUMAN \n\nREMAINS. \n\nThe laboratory work procedure was also systematized in a series of steps we would take out \n\non each of the contexts we wanted to study, and that can be summarized in the following \n\npoints: \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

Careful unpacking of the human remains on the work table. \n\n3. Lying out of skeletal remains in anatomical position. \n\n4. Cleaning of human remains (if necessary). \n\n5. Inventory of the bones present in each individual, as well as comments on \n\nconservation status, and collection of data in the corresponding file. \n\n6. General photography of the skeleton in anatomical position. \n\n7. Determination of gender and age by various methods (vide infra: 3.4 and 3.5) and \n\ndata collection of the results in another specific file model. \n\n8. Macroscopic analysis of surfaces looking for the various pathologies present in the \n\nindividual and its justification by differential diagnosis, as well as data collection in \n\na separated file. \n\n9. If necessary, microscopic or X-ray approach to certain bones which possibly would \n\nrequire a more specific analysis in order to define the differential diagnosis. \n\n10. Photography of observed pathological lesions. \n\n11. Careful packaging of human remains and transfer back to the store of human \n\nremains. \n\nIn the case of the packaging system of human remains, mention here that the ASP follows a \n\nspecific system: numbered boxes organized by context within which the human remains are \n\npackaged in sets of bones that represent the various anatomical sections (skull, torso, pelvic \n\ngirdle, shoulders, arms, hands, legs and feet), showing a specific label in each bag that \n\ncontains elements. The bones are organized inside the box, as far as possible, through a \n\nsystem that ensures that groups of heavier bones occupy the bottom of the box, so that the \n\nmost delicate remain above and do not support excessive weights which could lead to \n\ndamage. The ASP human osteology laboratory follows procedures in packing skeletons as \n\nrecommended by Barc, University of Bradford (Plate 3.1). \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n37 \n \n\n \n\nPLATE 3.1. Diagram which displays the correct way of packing skeletal remains. We can appreciate \n\nthe fact that the most heavy groups should be concentrated in the bottom of the craft, in order to \n\npreserve better the lighter ones in the top (From: University of Bradford, UK). \n\nThe work space also required specific preparation and constant maintenance and cleaning. \n\nSince the space provided in the laboratory of osteology had a hard, rigid surface (tiles), a \n\ndouble layer to lay the bones, consisting of two materials was prepared: a first layer of \n\nbubble wrap, to cushion contact of the bones with the hard surface, and a second surface \n\nlayer of cardboard of a coloration that was not present in the human remains (a blue tint \n\nthat would standardize the surface while facilitating the process of photo shoot). \n\nThe lay of human remains in anatomical position was made following the traditional model \n\nin extended supine position (Plate 3.2), with legs and feet parallel in top view, arms also \n\nparallel to the torso and hands facing up. In case of missing skeletal parts, was tried to \n\nmaintain anatomical spaces, to facilitate a better understanding of the skeleton and more \n\neffective photographic record. \n\nhttp://www.google.com.ph/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CAcQjRxqFQoTCPvC4uqi6cYCFQIdpgod09kDmg&amp;url=http://fromcemeterytoclinic.blogspot.com/&amp;ei=va6sVbvwNIK6mAXTs4_QCQ&amp;bvm=bv.98197061,d.dGY&amp;psig=AFQjCNGuIkscHod3RT9JcIR2cXls2e_G7g&amp;ust=1437466682173998\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

Individual 2247 from Ille Cave, displayed over the work space in anatomical position.  \n\nSometimes the cleaning of human remains was necessary to facilitate their study (Plate \n\n3.3): when requested, a dry cleaning of the bones was carried out, using soft bristled brush \n\nor wooden sticks, with several repetitions but without making excessive force that could \n\naffect the samples. In very specific cases, where the sediment adhering to the bones could \n\nnot be easily removed, \"wet\" cleaning was the best option: in this case the bone surface was \n\nnever directly wet (much less placed under water directly), but the bristles of the brush \n\nslightly moistened prior to brushing the samples. \n\nAs can be deduced from the work plan above, restoration work was not carried out (any \n\nconsolidation or glue process, because we wanted to avoid chemical affection on the bone \n\nstructure). Unfortunately was not possible to make any kind of cleaning of the profuse \n\nconcretions which were affecting several of different bone surfaces, since this procedure \n\nrequires the use of chemicals (such as dilute acetic acid) which were not available. \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

Photographic sequence taken during the process of bone cleaning: dry cleaning with wood \n\nstick (left and central images) and wet cleaning with brush (right). \n\n3.3. INVENTORY, PHOTOGRAPHY AND PRELIMINARY MACROSCOPICAL \n\nANALYSIS. \n\nOnce the complete skeleton had this initial treatment outlined above (section 3.2), it was \n\ntime to start recording it. For that was made a first specific file of data collection relating to \n\nthe inventory, organized in anatomical sections, including all the bones present in each \n\nindividual (also dental pieces, annotated by the FMI international system). Also was \n\nperformed a briefly outlining about their level of fragmentation and which parts of each \n\nbone were present or not (vid infra: 3.7 and Annex I). \n\nIn parallel, and continuously during the rest of the process of data collection over the \n\nhuman remains, was initiated at this time a phase of photographic work, for the preparation \n\nof the corresponding photographical archive, which would serve to illustrate both this paper \n\nand the files catalog itself, and that at the same time would serve as visual justification of \n\nthe various interpretations given to the human remains. \n\nThe photographs were taken with a reflex camera: model Canon EOS 600DTM, with \n\n58mm objective. At no time tripod or support element was used either for lack of \n\navailability or practical reasons, given the conditions of the workspace (as can be observed \n\nin Plate 3.4). \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n40 \n \n\nTwo complementary photographic series can be distinguished, for which external \n\nconditions change significantly: \n\n? Main series: this is the serial used to capture from the vertical the complete skeleton \n\nin anatomical position (which would associate the inventory of individual bones), \n\nusing both adjustment and automatic focus. Blue background was used to clearly \n\nmark the boundaries of the image. In addition, each individual would be \n\naccompanied by a chart with the number of context to which it belongs, as well as a \n\nmetric scale (an IFRAO scale was used because, besides marking ten centimeters \n\nand being more visible in the final picture, it adds additional information about \n\ncolor that could be of interest). The photographs were pulled from the vertical, \n\northogonal to the plane surface and without the use of flash, but serving the artificial \n\nlights of the own laboratory and auxiliary lights in some specific cases. In some \n\ncases the height of the laboratory is not high enough to capture the entire extended \n\nskeleton: in these cases two separate pictures were taken, with an area of overlap of \n\nat least 30%, so that a photogrammetric composition could be made with both the \n\nshots, corrected by using Photoshop\nTM\n\n. \n\n? Macro/details series: in this case the macro mode is used with manual focusing and \n\nadjustment, and again on blue background, but with a smaller metric scale (5 \n\ncentimeters). In some cases it was not possible to include images scale due to the \n\ndifficult positioning in the working plane of skeletal remains which were too fragile, \n\nbut the necessary measurements could be obtained from general pictures. We shoot \n\nthe photos as orthogonally as possible in the case of general views of whole bones, \n\nwhile in the case of photographs of detail this standard became secondary, intending \n\nto best reflect the areas of interest. In this series the use of additional artificial lights \n\nbecame a mandatory part of the process, in order to bring out details by the use of \n\nlight. \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

For the photographical register The use of artificial auxiliary lights, a uniformed color \n\nbackground and different measurement scales was also recurrent, in order to present as much \n\ninformation as possible in each series (right). \n\n3.4. SEX DETERMINATION. \n\nIn reference to the sex determination of the individuals, a number of methods are employed, \n\nbased in physiological aspects or skeletal landmarks that vary in men and women between \n\npopulations. In the Plate 3.5, for example, we can see the case of the skull in men and \n\nwomen: in general terms, the male is larger and heavier, with more apparent muscle \n\nattachments, further development of the occipital prominence and mastoid (in the \n\nsupramastoid, female is more curved ridge and ends on the acoustic meatus) and the \n\nsupraorbital ridge, causing a rounded supraorbital margin (FLANDER, 1978). \n\nThe elements showing the sexual dimorphism become especially visible in the skull and \n\npelvic girdle, so analyzing the morphology of both will be relatively easy to determine the \n\nsex of the individual to which they belong (BUIKSTRA, UBELAKER, 1994). To do this, \n\nanalysis over a series of landmarks in both the skull (Chart3.2, Plate 3.6) and the pelvis \n\n(Chart 3.3, Plates 3.7 and 3.8) was committed separately, which are listed in the charts \n\nbelow, and ideally identifiable as male or female according to its shape, by macroscopic \n\nobservation and comparison with the reference collection of the ASP laboratory or with \n\nliterature references (including comparative photographs and designs). Finally, the sum of \n\nall values will enable us to determine the sex of the  \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

DETERMINATION OF THE AGE AT DEATH. \n\nGrowth processes are also reflected in the human skeleton, and so does the degenerative \n\nprocesses that lead maturity to senescence. The reflection of them will serve, in a similar \n\nway to that seen for sexual determination, to identify the age that the study subjects had \n\nreached before death. \n\nWhile sometimes a method can give a largely reliable result, is always better to use several \n\nto get more accurate conclusions. Therefore, all possible methods had been applied in each \n\ncase exposed below. \n\nIt is important to consider two factors before exposing the various methodologies used to \n\ndetermine the age: \n\n? The younger the person, the more accurate the age we get as result of our analysis, \n\ngiven the homogeneity of the processes of growth compared to the individual \n\nirregularities of physical deterioration in the elderly (WHITE, FOLKENS, 2005, \n\npp.363). \n\n? We can\u00b4t give an exact number as result of our ageing process: the result of our \n\nanalysis is always given by an approximate range of years (WHITE, FOLKENS, \n\n2005, pp.364). \n\n \n\nTo express these age ranges, resort to the following table of intervals (Chart 3.4. - BAKER \n\net al. 2005; BUIKSTRA, UBELAKER, 1994): \n\nChart 3.4.

Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n47 \n \n\n? 3.5.1. Degree of fusion of the epiphysis. \n\nThe first method to determine the age of an individual may be the degree of fusion of the \n\nepiphysis of various bones of the skeleton (MCKERN, STEWART, 1957), a method \n\nespecially useful for infant-juvenile cases, but which fails for adults, since the last epiphysis \n\nwhich is completely fused, the medial epiphysis of the clavicle, closes in around 30 years \n\nold. The peculiarity of this method is that the merging of the various epiphysis occur in a \n\npredictable sequence (as in Plate 3.9), so if we look at the progress status in the merger of \n\nthem we can define more precisely the age range in which the individual was (with the \n\nlimit, as we say, in >30 years old, when all appear fused and the method is not so useful \n\nanymore). \n\n? 3.5.2. Fusion of the cranial sutures. \n\nAnother similar method is to analyze the level of fusion of the cranial sutures (MEINDL, \n\nLOVEJOY, 1985), which also reach various levels of fusion throughout life and in a certain \n\norder, to finish reaching the status of obliteration (maximum degree of closing). In this case \n\nit is a useful method for individuals who exceed 30 years of age, when these sutures begin \n\nto fuse significantly. \n\nThere are two sub-methods which focus in different cranial sutures, always analyzed from \n\nthe external surface of the skull (MEINDL, LOVEJOY, 1985): \n\n- Method of the cranial vault: sutures 1-7 (midlamboid, lambda, obelion, anterior \n\nsagittal, bregma, midcoronal and pterion). \n\n- Lateral-anterior method: sutures 6-10 (midcoronal, pterion, sphenofrontal, inferior \n\nsphenotemporal and superior sphenotemporal). \n\n \n\nDepending on the level of fusion, a different value is assigned to each suture (0 = open, 1 = \n\nstarting to obliterate, 2 = almost obliterated, 3 = completely obliterated), always looking to \n\nthe point indicated in the lower charts (Plate 3.10), with a maximum expansion of 1 cm \n\naround it, and subsequently the values of the two methods are added separately. The score \n\nwill have a range of age associated as a result, range which we can obtain from the \n\nreference chart (always taking into account the standard deviation associated with the \n\nresult, also expressed in the charts). \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n48 \n \n\n? 3.5.3. Eruption of the teeth. \n\nThe third method by which we can determine the age is the eruption of teeth (UBELAKER, \n\n1989), since the replacement of deciduous teeth (\"milk\u201d teeth) by the permanent teeth (20-\n\n32 teeth) also follows a rhythm and order along constant growth process, reaching its final \n\nstate around 32 years old (approximate limit of the method, although it varies greatly \n\nbetween individuals), as in Plate 3.11. \n\n \n\nPLATE 3.9.

Tooth wear analysis (Brothwell). \n\nTeeth also help determine the age of the owner if we consider the level of tooth wear: \n\ncomparative tables of Brothwell (like the one included in Plate 3.12: BROTHWELL, 1981) \n\nallow us to establish several approximated age ranges in each population, considering the \n\nprogressive wear of the teeth throughout life, because of the attrition process. The method \n\nis not useful in cases of non-natural wear patterns: abrasion, dental modification and \n\nalterations as a result of a specific activity. Hence, as shown in the Plate 3.9, the third molar \n\nappears in the second age group, and is the last in suffering the wear at the end of the \n\nprocess. \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

Pubic symphysis surface. \n\nAnother interesting method of determining age is the method of the pubic symphysis \n\n(BROOKS, SUCHEY, 1990), which also noticed that this surface thereof suffers a \n\ndegenerative process throughout life, which is also slightly distinguishable depending on \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

The description of each phase and the comparison with the images published by both \n\nauthors (Plate 3.13) make this one of the methods that allows a greater accuracy: we just \n\nanalyze the material we have and compare it with their descriptions and their sequence of \n\nimages of the process, we assign a degenerative process phase, and finally we compare with \n\nthe reference tables (organized by sex) in order to get a quite accurate age range (Chart3.6). \n\nThe description of each phase of this degenerative process (rated from 1 to 6, as follows) is \n\npresented in the next table (Chart 3.5). \n\nChart 3.5. DEGENERATIVE PROCESS IN THE SURFACE OF THE PUBIC \n\nSYMPHYSIS (as in BROOKS, SUCHEY, 1990). \n\nPHASE DESCRIPTION OF THE SURFACE \n\n1 The surface of the pubic symphysis appears covered with an undulating \n\nsurface (mountains and valleys of horizontal layout). Ossification nodules \n\nmay appear at the top, but at this stage the inferior limit does not appear yet. \n\n2 Nodules begin to appear defining the bottom edge of the pubic symphysis, \n\nand also on the top limit if they didn\u00b4t had developed from the start of the \n\nprocess. You can begin to glimpse a lifting of the central area, or a wall on \n\nthe undulating surface of the ventral side. \n\n3 Upper and lower limits are shown, as well as the wall on the ventral edge. Is \n\nalready possible to notice some degeneration in the undulating surface. \n\n4 The surface of the pubic symphysis goes from wavy to grainy, but may be \n\nstill visible remains of the undulating surface. The wall of the ventral side is \n\nclosed with the upper and lower limits, and also develops on the outside, \n\nleading to a marked oval boundary around the entire surface. Lipping may \n\nappear in the dorsal edge, as well as some brands in the ventral ligament. \n\n5 Smooth surface completed, fine sandy texture, the surface is shown as a \n\ndepression with respect to the edge of it.

Auricular surface of the ilium. \n\nFinally, there is another method for calculating the age also based on the degeneration of \n\nanother contact area in the skeleton: the method of the auricular surface of the ilium \n\n(LOVEJOY et al., 1985). This area also suffers a progressive degeneration (as seen in Plate \n\n3.14), so LOVEJOY et al. also described phases in a similar way to the previous method \n\n(section 3.5.5: pubic symphysis method), which also comes with sample images, as \n\ndisplayed in Plate 3.11, so that the method again is based on the comparison (after sexing, \n\nbecause this method also distinguishes between both sexes) and the recurrence to reference \n\ntables to establish the age of the individual being studied, based on their equivalence with \n\none of said stages of the degenerative process. These stages of degeneration have been \n\nranked from 1 to 8, as follows (Chart 3.7). \n\nChart 3.7. STAGES OF DEGENERATION OF THE AURICULAR SURFACE \n\nOF THE ILIUM AND AGE RANGES ASOCIATED  \n\n(as in LOVEJOY et al., 1985). \n\nSTAGE AGE RANGE DESCRIPTION OF THE SURFACE  \n\n1 20-24 years Undulating surface with a fine grain. \n\n2 25-29 years Less undulating, but retains a youthful look. \n\n3 30-34 years Stretch marks begging to appear, thickening granulometry. \n\n4 35-39 years Coarse grain size throughout the surface uniform. \n\n5 40-44 years Transition to a dense surface, usually in \"islands\". \n\n6 45-49 years Fully dense surface without grain. \n\n7 50-59 years Dense and wrinkled surface, periauricular moderate \n\nactivity. \n\n8 >60 years Marginal lipping, microporosities, preauricular \n\nirregularities. \n\n \n\nOf course there are countless other studies on various methods of calculating age (looking \n\nfrom the external extremity of the ribs to the structure of the spongy tissue of the proximal \n\nepiphysis of the humerus or femur, within others: WHITE, FOLKENS, 2005, pp.381-385), \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n54 \n \n\nbut the ones shown here are the most frequent and, therefore, we have decided to base our \n\nstudy on its functionality. \n\n \n\nPLATE 3.14.

DETERMINATION OF PALEOPATHOLOGIES AND DIFFERENTIAL \n\nDIAGNOSIS.  \n\nAs for the registration of paleopathologies which we carried out on each individual, again \n\nthe direct macroscopic observation would be the procedure to follow: the location of the \n\ndifferent markers associated with each disease. Through the study of symptoms we could \n\nunderstand what kind of pathological condition was affecting each individual, as well as \n\nanalyzing also which anatomical region would suffer this aim. \n\nFor the diagnosis of every disease we turn to two sources that facilitated the comparative \n\nstudy: \n\n- Bibliography and photographs on paleopathology and current pathology. Atlases of \n\npaleopathology offer a good first approximation, since they distinguish and classify \n\nthe various ailments according to the markers present in the osteological material, \n\ngiving good definitions of the symptoms of each disease and offering visuals \n\n(photographs, X-rays, etc.) that allow us to establish comparative relationships. For \n\nmore specific cases, the consult of specialized references about particular \n\npathologies or case studies was also committed. \n\n- Reference collection: the comparison with other cases present in the human \n\nosteology laboratory of ASP. \n\nIt is also important to introduce a concept from the current medical science here which also \n\nbecomes a basic tool in paleopathology studies when defining the disease that we face: the \n\ndifferential diagnosis, which involves distinguishing a disease or condition within others \n\npresenting similar signs and symptoms (BUIKSTRA, UBELAKER, 1994, pp.107-112). \n\nThis process of weighing the probability of one disease versus that of other diseases was \n\nused in cases of nosological charts which presented similar manifestations, in order to \n\ndiscard those farthest options to the real ones. \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n56 \n \n\nIs also relevant to understand that all diagnoses offered in this and other works on \n\npaleopathology are always presumptive diagnosis (ROBERTS, MANCHESTER, 2010, \n\npp.33-34): even in modern medicine is sometimes difficult to determine exactly pathology; \n\nin paleopathology we use to arrive at our diagnosis by exclusion, differential diagnosis, \n\nwhat sometimes is not enough to prove, as required by the clinical medicine of our time. \n\nAll information and photographs obtained in relation to each individual paleopathological \n\nstudy were recorded in the corresponding file model (vid infra: 3.7) and organized in a files \n\ncatalog which we present appended to this paper (Annex III). \n\n3.7. MICROSCOPICAL ANALYSIS AND X-RAY: COMPLEMENTARY \n\nTECHNIQUES. \n\nWhen was expected to get some data not shown from direct inspection of human remains, \n\nalso two complementary techniques where used, that serve to guide with certainty the \n\nnature of the injury: \n\n- Microscope and binocular lenses (Plates 3.15 and 3.16). The use of a microscope \n\n(model SMZ-745 C-Leds of Nikon), in which a digital camera was implemented \n\n(Nikon D5000) was really useful both for the determination of pathological marks \n\nimpossible to detect macroscopically, and also for documenting them through \n\nphotography (this technique was used mainly in cases of DEH or in some unusual \n\ndental patterns). \n\n- X-Ray (CHHEM, BROTHWELL, 2008). Radiological analysis was also required \n\nfor the diagnosis of three different pathologies of three different individuals from \n\nIlle. The UP Health Services equipment and human resources participated in this \n\npart of the project. Digital radiography was done over the individuals, focusing in \n\nthe anatomical regions of interest, in which a previous macroscopical analysis was \n\ndone in the osteology laboratory. \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

INTRODUCTION: THE RESULTS OF SEX AND AGE DETERMINATION.  \n\nThe laboratory study, brought from the techniques and methodologies described in Chapter \n\n3, let to study a total of 20 individuals for the period and ageing range defined for our work, \n\na minimum number of individuals (MNI) which coincided with the sample of context \n\nnumbers selected for the study (Chapter 3.2).  \n\nThe determination of the stature of the individuals is not part of the study because of the \n\npreservation status made impossible the analysis, as already explained in Chapter 1.2. \n\nAbout the age and sex determination of the individuals analyzed, the following situations \n\ncould be defined: \n\n? 4.1.1. Age estimation (Chart 4.1).  \n\nOf the 20 individuals analyzed, we could age 11 cases, and all of them formed part of our \n\nstudy, since they were adult individuals. \n\n9 cases which couldn\u00b4t be aged, presented such a poor status of preservation that no \n\npathologies where registered in them.

Various cases of degenerative \n\njoint diseases were registered (Schmorl's nodes, osteoarthritis in the column or other \n\njoints, and also non-specific joint diseases), as well as infectious diseases \n\n(periostitis, osteitis, osteomyelitis), metabolic diseases (cribra orbitalia) and a few \n\ncases of traumatism (some cases of healed fractures). \n\nIn the following pages, the summary charts of the results of the analysis are displayed, both \n\nfor the age (Chart 4.1) and sex determination (Chart 4.1), and also the distribution of the \n\ndifferent pathologies (dental and non-dental paleopathologies) beneath the different groups \n\nof sex and age, as well as the different pathological markers. \n\nChart 4.4.

DENTAL PATHOLOGY. \n\nIn 8 of the 20 cases analyzed in Ille Cave, the presence of various dental pathologies \n\nwas documented, although only one of this cases presented a framework of tooth wear \n\nby attrition (because of the condition of the individual from context 800, part of this \n\ngroup: very fragmented, covered with concretions that prevented the analysis of \n\nsurfaces). In all other individuals (contexts 67, 727, 755, 907, 1337, 1825 and 2247) a \n\nseries of teeth pathologies where registered; paleopathologies from which we can infer \n\nissues of dental health and diet of the study population: exposure of the dental roots, \n\nbrands of infection in the alveolar surfaces of both maxilla and mandible, ante mortem \n\nteeth loss (AMTL), accumulations of calculus or caries presence. Meanwhile, other \n\npathologies such as dental enamel hypoplasia (DEH), allow us to approach from the \n\nperspective of their subsistence during subadult age. \n\nUnfortunately, given the limited results inferred of the laboratory study (which was \n\npositive in the presence of pathologies in only 11 cases out of 20 adults studied, in \n\nwhose group 8 had the indicated teeth conditions), and the fact that sexual diagnosis \n\noffered no decisive results in many cases (only 2 clear male individuals presenting \n\ndental pathology, plus a possible male, three possible feminine and two cases where \n\nsexual diagnosis was not possible), will not allow us to commit comparative studies \n\nbetween sexes, which could have led to establish dietary or activity differences between \n\nthe sexes, as has been achieved in other archaeological sites in Southeast Asia later \n\n(PIETRUSEWSKY, TSANG, 2003, pp.210; OXENHAM, MATSUMURA, KIM \n\nDUNG, 2010, pp.90). The corresponding statistical chart follows (Chart 4.7). \n\nAll the results obtained for dental pathology, which will be covered below, will be \n\ninteresting for inferring certain patterns regarding dental health, diet and some potential \n\nactivities undertaken within the population represented in the assemblage (Chapter 5). \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n66 \n \n\n \n\n? 4.3.1. Periodontal disease. Root exposure, alveolar infection, calculus. \n\nPeriodontal disease (ROBERTS, MANCHESTER, 2010, pp.188-190) involves an \n\ninflammatory process which responds to the presence of several irritant factors, being \n\nthe main one the presence of bacterial dental plaque (sticky coating formed by proteins, \n\nfood particles and both living and dead microorganisms), or specially the calculus \n\ndeposits (ROBERTS, MANCHESTER, 2010, pp.185-186), result of the mineralization \n\nof the plaque, and which can be registered in archeological record in the shape of hard \n\nconcretions over the tooth surface (normally around the junction area between the \n\ncrown and the root (ORTNER, 2003, pp.593; HILLSON, 1996, pp.255). The presence \n\nof calculus is, then, one of the three markers which allow us to determine a case of \n\nperiodontitis: in the collection of Ille Cave, all the 6 individuals cited (context numbers \n\n67, 727, 755, 907, 1337 and 2247) presented calculus deposits distributed in the crown-\n\nroot area of all the dental pieces.  \n\nBoth plaque and calculus suppose a stimulus for the inflammation of the soft tissues \n\n(gums) around the tooth, known as gingivitis. The untreated gingivitis can develop to \n\ncases of periodontitis, in which also the alveolar bone suffers the infection (ORTNER, \n\n2003, pp.593). The second marker which permits the diagnosis of this pathology, and \n\nwhich we documented in all the cases of Ille except of the context 727 (bad preservation  \n\nstatus) is the presence of reactive alveolar bone around the teeth (alveolar resorption). \n\nAn immediate consequence after this loss of alveolar bone caused by the expansion of \n\nthe infection is the exposure of the dental roots, which is the third indicator that we \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n67 \n \n\nshould consider for determine the presence of the periodontal disease, and which again \n\nwe registered in all the individuals of our study. Other possible consequences of the \n\nspread of the infection can be the appearance of periodontal abscess (which we couldn\u00b4t \n\nidentify in any case of Ille assemblage), or the affection of the periodontal ligament and \n\nthe subsequent teeth loss (ORTNER, 2003, pp.594, HILLSON, 1996, pp.262). We can \n\nobserve an example of all this features in Plate 4.1. \n\nThe periodontal disease is the main paleopathology which could be observed in the case \n\nof the teeth collection of Ille Cave, which was registered in 6 of the 8 individuals. \n\nBecause of preservation factors already discussed (Chapter 4.2 introduction) was not \n\ndocumented in the rest of individuals analyzed, and also was not clearly present in the \n\ncase of context 1825, but the presence in this individual of a case of root exposure could \n\npoint to another possible case of periodontitis. Also, one of this 6 individuals which \n\ngave positive results to periodontal disease, the one from the context 727, doesn\u00b4t show \n\nsigns of alveolar resorption, but other markers of the pathology are present (root \n\nexposure and significate calculus), so we can explain the absence of the third \n\ndiagnostical factor as consequence of the preservation status, which led to a poor \n\nconservation status of the alveolar surfaces (concretions in both maxilla and mandible). \n\n \n\nPLATE 4.1. Sample picture displaying the right mandibular molars from context 2247, in which we \n\ncan observe calculus deposits (green arrows), root exposure (gingival margin before its recession \n\nmarked in red) and the reactive alveolar bone around the dental insertions (between the yellow \n\narrows). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n68 \n \n\n? 4.3.2. Carious lesions. \n\nCaries is defined as \u201ca disease process characterized by the progressive decalcification \n\nof the enamel or dentine\u201d (WHITE, BLACK, FOLKENS, 2012, pp.455), which \n\nnormally is the result of the accumulation of dental plaque in the mouth and a diet \n\nwhich includes fermentable carbohydrates. The dental plaque will be the matrix in \n\nwhich a community of acid-producing bacteria (mainly streptococcus mutans associated \n\nwith other secondary contributor bacteria) will inhabit, so the infection will start in the \n\ntooth surface, expanding latter into the tooth structure, in both crown and root (this last \n\none in cases of root exposure), and demineralizing the enamel and lately the dentin, \n\ndestroying both the hard and soft tissues (ORTNER, 2003, pp.590; HILLSON, 1996, \n\npp.270; ROBERTS, MANCHESTER, 2010, pp.171-172). \n\nMacroscopically, the caries can be noticed in several formats: can appear as smooth \n\nopaque spots in the crown of the teeth, but also, in more advances status, as cavities or \n\npits of variable size which can affect the teeth surfaces in various aspects (normally in \n\nthe fissures of the crowns in the occlusal aspect of the teeth, but is also frequent that \n\nthey appear between the teeth, in the interproximal areas).  \n\nIn the case of Ille Cave, two cases where registered (context 755, possible masculine, \n\nyoung adult; and context 2247, clearly male, young-middle adult) which correspond to \n\ndifferent status in this process: the individual from the context 755 presented some \n\nsmall black pits in the occlusal aspect of the second and third molars of both left and \n\nright sides of the mandible, in which the destructive process just affected the enamel; \n\nmeanwhile, in the case of individual 2247, the caries were registered in the left first \n\nmolar from the mandible, in the interproximal surface with the second molar, and also \n\nin the buccal-labial aspects of both M2 and M3 in the same side. In this second case, the \n\ncaries lesion appeared with a more advanced aspect: deep black-colored cavities which \n\nextended all over the surfaces of the three molars, with a complete destruction of the \n\nenamel but also of almost all the dentine, giving the teeth the appearance of being \n\nalmost emptied.  \n\nThe Plate 4.2 displays both cases, so than the different status can be observed. \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n69 \n \n\n    \n\nPLATE 4.2. Carious lesions (pointed with green arrows) observed in the mandibular molars of the \n\nindividual from context 755 (left images) and the right mandibular molars of the skeleton from \n\n2247 (right images).  \n\nNormally, as secondary effects of the appearance of dental caries and their development \n\nto advanced states, the spread of the infection inside the pulp cavity results in the \n\nmassive destruction of tissue in the base of the tooth root (ORTNER, 2003, pp.593), and \n\nalso the creation of pus which would drain through the alveolar process by the creation \n\nof an abscess (although, in the case of Ille Cave, no abscess where registered in the \n\nstudied assemblage, neither associated to the caries presence nor to any other \n\npathological conditions). \n\n? 4.3.3. Ante mortem teeth loss (AMTL). \n\nSome teeth can be missing during the life of the individuals who suffer different \n\npathological conditions (for example, periodontal disease). In this case, the loss of \n\nalveolar bone due to periodontitis, along with the periodontal ligament, which \n\nundermines the support structure for the dental pieces (ORTNER, 2003, pp.592-593), \n\ncan finish with ante mortem teeth loss (AMTL). So then, there are several different \n\nreasons for the manifestation of AMTL (TOOMAY, DOUGLAS, 2006, pp.193): \n\npresence of caries, accidental removal, intentional removal or tooth wear associated to \n\nexposition of the pulp. \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n70 \n \n\nIn the case of Ille Cave, one case of AMTL with alveolar resorption was recorded in the \n\nthird right molar of the maxilla of the individual from context 1337 (Plate 4.3), a young \n\nadult probable female individual. The surface of the alveolar bone clearly suffered a \n\nremodeling process, what discards the intentional removal of the tooth. Possibly the \n\ntooth finished falling because of the infectious process documented in the rest of the \n\nmouth: this individual also presented signs of alveolar infection in both mandible and \n\nmaxilla, as well as teeth root exposure and the most significant deposits of calculus of \n\nall the collection, present in all the dental pieces both in lingual and labial aspects. \n\n \n\nPLATE 4.3. Ante mortem tooth loss (AMTL) in the space left by the right third molar of the \n\nmaxilla, part of the skeleton from context 1337 of Ille Cave. Can be observed that the remodeling \n\nprocess has been partially completed. \n\n? 4.3.4. Dental enamel hypoplasia (DEH/LEH). \n\nAn interesting case of abnormal quality of teeth is also typically documented in \n\nSoutheast Asian ancient populations (Chapter 5), and the case of Ille is also a good \n\nexample: the dental enamel hypoplasia, which is manifested by the presence of \n\nhorizontal linear grooves in the surfaces of the teeth, together with a fine porosity all \n\nover the enamel (ROBERTS, MANCHESTER, 2010, pp.193-194; ORTNER, 2003, \n\npp.594-595; WHITE, BLACK, FOLKENS, 2012, pp.455-456).

Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n71 \n \n\npresence of these hypoplastic lines, which is particularly more evident in the maxillary \n\nincisives (but which are specially easy to identify in both mandibular and maxillary \n\nincisives and canines, as in the case of Ille Cave), is an indicator of the interruption of \n\nenamel formation (or amelogenesis) during the teeth formation processes in childhood.  \n\nDifferent factors of stress can stimulate this interruption in the formation of the enamel, \n\nalways manifested by the individual before the timing for the formation of the dental \n\ncrowns of the permanent dentition (around 6 years old), and the study of the different \n\nsequences of the lines can give us clues about the age in which the individual suffered \n\nthis stress periods: trauma, infections, malnutrition, poor oral hygiene, etc (ORTNER, \n\n2003, pp.595). \n\nIn the case of Ille Cave, DEH was registered in 5 of the 8 individuals which allowed \n\ndental analysis (in the other 3 individuals which presented postaxial pathologies, the \n\nmouth and the dental pieces where not preserved): individuals from the context 67, 727, \n\n755, 1337 and 2247. As we can see in the Chart 4.8, the presence of these defects in the \n\ntooth enamel were always recorded in the frontal area (mandible and maxilla, always \n\nincisives and canines), except in the case of the context 67, in which also both \n\nmandibular first premolars where affected.   \n\nPlate 4.4 offers a good example of this condition documented in one of Ille Cave \n\nindividuals. \n\n? 4.3.5. Teeth wear: attrition and abrasion.  \n\nAmong all the individuals in whom dental study was carried on, can be observed that all \n\nof them presented really similar wear patterns. The consequences of the attrition process \n\n(natural teeth wear caused by the continuous contact and friction between the teeth \n\nduring the masticatory process and the chemical affection of them caused the mixture of \n\nthe food residues with the saliva and mouth mucosa) in Ille Cave prehistoric population \n\nshowed exposition of the dentine in almost all the teeth. For understanding better the \n\npossible groups of individuals associated to the different stages of occlusal wear, was \n\ncommitted an study based in a reference scoring system (BUIKSTRA, UBELAKER, \n\n1994, pp.52-53), which results follow in Chart 4.9. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n73 \n \n\n \n\nPLATE 4.4. A good example of the dental enamel hypoplasia in Ille Cave is the one presented in \n\nthese images of the mandibular teeth of the individual from context 67. We can observe the DEH \n\ntypical linear grooves marked with black arrows. A) LC, B) LPM1, C) RC, D) RPM1. \n\nThe teeth assemblage studied presents normally and advanced status of teeth wear: half \n\npart of the cases present large dentine areas with a surrounding enamel ring in the \n\nfrontal teeth (including premolars) occlusal surfaces, even some times giving the teeth a \n\n\u201cshovel\u201d aspect; meanwhile, more than a quarter part of the surfaces of each molar \n\nquadrants exhibit dentine in isolated islands, even in concave shapes, although the \n\nocclusal surface is still surrounded by an enamel ring. Plate 4.5 shows examples of all \n\nthe different status of wear documented in Ille. \n\nIf taken in account that the individual from context 727 presents a case of unusual wear \n\npattern (ROBERTS, MANCHESTER, 2010, pp.205) related to a specific non-\n\nmasticatory habit in the molars (Chapter 5), could perfectly fit in this group wear \n\npatterns. Also, two unusual wear patterns were documented in the frontal mandibular \n\nteeth of the individuals from contexts 755 and 2247, which we will explain in the \n\ndiscussion of Chapter 5.  \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n74 \n \n\nThe first of the unusual wear pattern (Plate 4.6) was documented in the frontal teeth \n\n(incisives and canines) of the mandible of two of the individuals (context 755 and \n\n2247): all the referred dental pieces showed a pattern of wear in oblique sense, in \n\nlingual-labial direction, giving the surface of the enamel a smooth aspect which \n\nfollowed a rounded shape (not flat, like in cases of advanced states of attrition or \n\nmalocclusion). \n\nIn the case of the skeleton from context 2247, other interesting markers where registered \n\nduring the microscopical analysis (Plate 4.7): \n\n- Longitudinal microrotures of the enamel of an incisor (RI2), in a vertical sense \n\nof the lingual surface. \n\n- Microscopical grooving pattern over the occlusal surface of the incisors \n\n(particularly in LI1 and LI2), all of them linear and in vertical direction. \n\nThese markers confirm the presence of a constant strength supported by the frontal \n\nteeth, strength which would follow a lingual-labial direction, with a vertical component \n\nwhich would go from up to down (which would explain both the direction of the \n\ngrooves and the vertical disposition of the shelling in RI2). \n\nThe second unusual wear pattern which we registered in the Ille Cave osteological \n\nassemblage was the one of the mandibular molars of context 727 (middle adult \n\nindividual, probable female). While the rest of the teeth of this individual shows normal \n\npatterns of erosion caused by attrition (occlusal surfaces), the molars of both sides of the \n\nmandible showed a concave wear pattern in lingual-buccal direction: scoped dentine, \n\nweared to almost a short of chisel shape, as can be appreciated in Plate 4.8. This \n\nparticular form of erosion, together with the fact that both third molars where \n\ncompletely flat-weared to the roots (what is kind of strange if we take in account the \n\nfact than the third molar is the last one in erupt: then, why is more weared than M1 and \n\nM2?), as well as that the damages over the enamel and dentine presented a more \n\nadvanced status in the right side of the mouth (asymmetrical), allowed us to discount \n\nany natural reasons (attrition, malocclusion) or parafunctional habit (like the \n\nbruxism/teeth grinding), so this particular case could point to the use of the molar region \n\nin some kind of cultural habit or activity, as will be analyzed in Chapter 5. \n\n \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

In any case, the corresponding statistical chart of pathological conditions \n\ndistributed by sex follows (Chart 4.10). \n\n \n\n? 4.4.1. Metabolic diseases. Cribra orbitalia. \n\nIn the case of the skeleton coming from the context 800 (young adult, probable female), \n\nwe could notice an area of porosity associated with a process of bone remodeling in the \n\nroof of its right ocular orbit (unfortunately the left one is missing, so we couldn\u00b4t \n\ndetermine if it would appear in both sides). After discarding the fact that the porosity \n\ncould be result of postdepositional factors, and since in this case the reactive bone \n\nprocess confirmed the pathological condition, a case of cribra orbitalia could be \n\ndiagnosed, pathology normally present in the archaeological skeletal register of ancient \n\npopulations, really interesting from the perspective of the dietary studies: the affection \n\nof the bone in the orbit roofs is normally the result of the hyperplasia of the diplo\u00eb, the \n\nspongy bone structure between the compact bone surfaces of the flat bones present in \n\nthe orbits (WALKER et al., 2009, pp.109; ROBERTS, MANCHESTER, 2010, pp.546). \n\nThe presence of cribra orbitalia is often diagnosed through several markers which tend \n\nto characterize it (NAVEED et al., 2012, pp.394): the reduction of the cortical bone \n\ndensity in the orbital roof, an increased granularity in the medullary layer of the bone \n\nsurface, a representative thickening of the orbital roof in several cases (especially in \n\nadvanced states of the condition) and an increase in the middle table of bone (possibly \n\nto approach trough X-Ray tests) are the four characteristics which use to be present.  \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n80 \n \n\nSeveral states had been identified in the progress of this pathology (NAVEED et al., \n\n2012, pp.395), as shown in Plate 4.9: \n\n- Grade 0: normal bone surface. \n\n- Grade 1: capillary-like impressions in the bone surface. \n\n- Grade 2: scattered fine foramina in the bone surface. \n\n- Grade 3: large and small isolated foramina in the bone surface. \n\n- Grade 4: foramina with trabecular involvement phase of remodeling (typical in \n\nadult individuals, since the pathology is more evident in subadults). \n\n- Grades 5-6: presence of partial destruction of the roof of the orbit. \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nPLATE 4.9. Stuart-Macadam defined grades of progression of cribra orbitalia (grades 0-4), as \n\nexplained in the main text: vid supra (From: NAVEED et al., 2012, pp.395). \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n81 \n \n\nIn the case of context 800 (Plate 4.10), we could observe remodeling in the several \n\nforamina present in the roof of the orbit, so we could determine a Grade 4, what is \n\nlogical following the previous pattern if we take in account that the individual is a \n\nyoung adult: the disease affected the individual during early vital phases, but the arrival \n\nto adulthood and a possible access to a better diet, together with a stronger organism, \n\nmade easier the healing process. \n\n \n\nPLATE 4.10. Signs of metabolic disease (cribra orbitalia) in the right orbit roof of the individual 800 \n\nfrom Ille Cave.  \n\n? 4.4.2. Degenerative joint diseases. Osteoarthritis and Schmorl\u00b4s nodes. \n\nSeveral degenerative conditions which affected the joints of some individuals where \n\ndocumented during the laboratorial analysis of the assemblage. \n\nThe first of these conditions was spinal osteoarthritis. This pathology is associated with \n\nthe presence physical stress in the area (ROBERTS, MANCHESTER, 2010, pp.340-\n\n341), which variates in every point of the spine (since it\u00b4s curved, not completely \n\nvertical), so that the variation of frequency of the pathology does as well. \n\nThree main components are normally present in the development of osteoarthritis, \n\nwhich presence allowed the determination of the pathology in the studied assemblage \n\n(ORTNER, 2011, pp.546): first, the breakdown of the articular cartilage, which would \n\nlead to the contact and abrasion between bone surfaces; second, the formation of \n\nreactive bone, mainly in the subchondral compact and trabecular bone; and third, the \n\nconsequent growth of new cartilage and bone in the margins of the joint. \n\nAs the result of this process, three markers can be generally observed in the bones \n\naffected by this condition: marginal lipping, as the result of the new bone formation \n\n(example in Plate 4.11); eburnated surfaces, as the result of the contact and abrasion \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

These characteristics \n\nwhere documented in two individuals of the assemblage studies: the ones from contexts \n\n727 (middle adult, probable female) and 2247 (male young-middle adult), as illustrated \n\nin Chart 4.11. Unfortunately, no signs of eburnation where documented in any case, but \n\nthis fact was attributed to the poor preservation status of the column in both individuals. \n\nChart 4.11.

Osteomyelitis, periostitis and osteitis. \n\nThree different varieties of infectious diseases were also registered in the study phase of \n\nthe selected assemblage of prehistoric individuals from Ille: \n\n- Context 703 (adult of indeterminate sex): osteomyelitis in forearms (ulna and \n\nradius) and legs (tibia and fibula). \n\n- Context 2247 (masculine young-middle adult): periostitis in legs and arms; also, \n\nosteitis in pubis and sacroiliac joint. \n\nThe osteomyelitis is an infectious disease which normally starts with the introduction of \n\npyogenic bacteria in the bone tissue, normally staphylococcus aureus, although other \n\nagents (virus, fungus, parasite) can also cause the genesis of this condition (BAPTISTA, \n\nTARDIVO, 2012, pp.6; ORTNER, 2011, pp.181; ROBERTS, MANCHESTER, 2010, \n\npp.408-409). If the infection spreads through the cortex and/or the periosteum, the case \n\nwould be recognized as secondary osteomyelitis; meanwhile, once the infection affects \n\nthe medullary cavity, the pathology would manifest in its strongest modality.  \n\nThe creation of pus inside the medullary cavity makes the diaphysis of the bone support \n\nand stress, which naturally results in the creation of round-shaped openings in its \n\nsurface (cloacae or fistulae), which would allow the drainage of it to the exterior \n\n(ORTNER, 2011, pp.182-184; WHITE, FOLKENS, 2005, pp.318). Also, the pus can \n\nproduce the elevation of the periosteum of the bone, and as well the creation of new \n\nbone surrounding the original bone cortex: the involucrum or sequestrum (ORTNER, \n\n2011, pp.182-186; WHITE, FOLKENS, 2005, pp.318), which would give the bone a \n\ndeformed shape. \n\nThe individual recovered in the context 703 of Ille Cave, an adult which sex could not \n\nbe determined, clearly showed this pathological condition (Plate 4.14), since both \n\ncloacae and involucrum could be noticed in both forearms (ulna x2 and radius x1) and \n\ndown legs (tibia x2 and fibula x1).  \n\nThe next pathological condition documented was the periostitis, although is important \n\nto explain here that it\u00b4s not considered as a disease by itself (WHITE, FOLKENS, 2005, \n\npp.318): periostitis is a term normally used to define the inflammatory process of the \n\nperiosteum of the bone (normally long bones), and which can be a consequence of \n\nmultiple factors (both traumatic or infectious).  \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n86 \n \n\nThe origin of the periostitis comes normally from the formation of microtraumatisms \n\nwich appear in the periostium of the long bones in the legs, caused by locomotor intense \n\nactivities (for example, intense running: the vibrations caused for the constant impact of \n\nthe limbs in the floor can be one factor wich could cause the microrotures). This \n\nmicrorotures will be the focus from where the infection will expand a posteriori. As a \n\nconsequence of this, the periosteum supports the surface formation of new lamellar \n\nbone, normally following an organized striated pattern in parallel lines (ORTNER, \n\n2011, pp.206-207; ROBERTS, MANCHESTER, 2010, pp.417-418): this pattern allows \n\nthe differential diagnosis, like happened in the only case registered in Ille Cave, the \n\nindividual from context 2247 (a male young-middle adult), as can be noticed in Plate \n\n4.15. Is interesting that the distribution of this new bone formations affects specially to \n\nthe inferior limbs of the individual, and even more in the case of the tibia, another \n\nevidence for the diagnosis, since normally this kind of infectious disease manifest \n\nstronger in the tibial diaphysis (ROBERTS, MANCHESTER, 2010, pp.417). \n\nBut, overall this conditions, the same individual also presented a case of pubic osteitis, \n\nthe third infectious manifestation registered in the assemblage. While the terms \n\nosteomyelitis or periostitis offer more defined descriptions for particular conditions, the \n\nterm osteitis has worked in the bibliography as a more general term for the \n\n\u201cinflammation of bone tissue caused by infection or injury and which is not specific as \n\nto cause\u201d (as in WHITE, FOLKENS, 2005, pp.317). \n\nThe pubic osteitis is frequent in sportive people, especially in cases of people which \n\nmake a lot of exercise with the down limbs (MAJOR, HELMS, 1997, pp.711-712; \n\nGABARR\u00d3 et al., 2008, pp.346), what would fit well with the case of periostitis \n\ndetermined for individual from context 2247. Normally the intense changes of rhythm \n\nduring the locomotion, such as abrupt accelerations or decelerations, climbing activities \n\nor kick movements, are the detonation facts for the spread of the infection (MAJOR, \n\nHELMS, 1997, pp.712; GABARR\u00d3 et al., 2008, pp.346). This high intensity of the \n\nactivity makes the pubic area suffer quite big stress situations (Plate 4.16): the strong \n\nabdominal efforts can create micro-traumatisms, which would be the focus of the \n\nimmediate infection, being pseudomonas aeuriginosa the most recurrent bacteria \n\n(GABARR\u00d3 et al., 2008, pp.346). \n\n \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

Detailed pictures of the pubic symphisis of the individual from the context 2247, in \n\nwich we can observe the degeneration of the bone surface and the complementary growth of new \n\nbone.  \n\n? 4.4.4. Trauma. Ante mortem fractures. \n\nBeneath all the individuals registered in Ille Cave which presented pathological \n\nconditions, also three different cases of trauma where registered: \n\n- Context 2247 (masculine young-middle adult): lateral healed fracture of the \n\nright nasal bone. \n\n- Context 1825 (young adult, indeterminate sex): healed oblique fracture of the \n\nleft femur. \n\n- Context 484 (adult, indeterminate sex): healed traumatism in the thorax with \n\ncostovertebral involvement (right side). \n\nAbout the case of the nasal fracture in the individual recovered from the context 2247 of \n\nIlle Cave (Plate 4.17), the differential diagnosis was committed (for distinguish it from \n\npossible morphological anomalies) attending to different aspects normally used in this \n\ncases (as in LESSA, MENDO\u00c7A DE SOUZA, 2006, pp.134): \u201cformation of new bone, \n\nabsence of bone, bone resorption, interruptions or breaks in anatomical structures, \n\ncortical healing indicated by high-density areas, active resorption indicated by porotic \n\nareas associated with bone loss, and fissures and depressions that might indicate \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n90 \n \n\nmorphological change associated with trauma\u201d. In this sense, the fact that the individual \n\nfrom Ille presented some of these aspects would point to a clear case of nasal \n\ntraumatism: \n\n- The presence of fracture lines and dislocation: easy to notice in the surface of the \n\nnasal bones, since no callus covered them (except possibly in the superior limit \n\nbetween both nasal bones). We could notice that the right nasal bone suffered a \n\nhorizontal fracture, possibly as a product of a lateral impact, and that the inferior \n\npart of it also suffered a dislocation. \n\n- The fact that the fracture lines healed in a misaligned position: the dislocated \n\nfragment healed in a misaligned position, as we can observe in the presence of \n\nempty spaces (inferior part of the connection between the fragment and the \n\nmaxilla) and the irregular surface of connection between both nasals. This \n\nunaligned healing is frequent in this cases of nasal fracture, in which \u201cthe \n\nfragments can rarely be reduced to the original position or stabilized, thus \n\nresulting in badly aligned healing, with aesthetic and functional consequences\u201d \n\n(LESSA, MENDO\u00c7A DE SOUZA, 2006, pp.134). \n\n- Possible absence of bony microfragments in the areas described, which could be \n\nconsequence of the reabsorption or expulsion of them by the organism. \n\n- The septum seemed deviated, although this could be a consequence of \n\npostdepositional process. \n\nThe second case of traumatism that which was documented in Ille assemblage was the \n\nhealed oblique femoral shaft fracture in the left down limb of the individual from \n\ncontext 1825 (WHITE, BLACK, FOLKENS, 2012, pp.434; ROBERTS, \n\nMANCHESTER, 2010, pp.226-227). The healed fracture was registered on the \n\nmidshaft of the bone, as can be observed in Plate 4.18, but we couldn\u00b4t determine the \n\npresence of any callus, what together with the formation of lamellar/woven bone, which \n\nwas already being replaced in some areas with trabecular bone, make thought that the \n\nprocess of fracture repair was in the an advanced phase, the remodeling stage \n\n(ROBERTS, MANCHESTER, 2010, pp.232-234). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

We can \n\nnotice in the images the misaligned healed fracture lines, and also de deviation of the septum. \n\nAlso, a modern fracture, possible result of the excavation process, crossed perpendicular \n\nto the healed fracture, that allowed to confirm again that the fracture was oblique and \n\nthat it didn\u2019t repair in its original aligned position, but in a lateral superposition between \n\nboth broken ends (both medullary cavities appear in a parallel position in the visible \n\ncross section), possibly as a result of the muscular spams following the stress, which \n\nwould have pulled the broken end past each other (WEBB, 1995, pp.196).  \n\nThe X-Ray analysis allowed proving the overlapping between both femoral fragments, \n\nwhich carried the posterior misaligned fracture (Plate 4.18). \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

In the X-Ray vision (anterior), the overlapping of fragments seems more \n\nvisible (marked with white arrows). \n\nFinally, the individual retrieved from context 484 presented a case of costovertebral \n\ntrauma, which implied the dislocation of the ribs of the right side of the thorax (from 2\nnd\n\n \n\nto 8\nth\n\n), and which started a healing process without being reinserted in their original \n\nposition, as can be appreciated in Plate 4.19. Since the rest of the thorax is not \n\npreserved, but the scapula from the same side doesn\u00b4t present any sign of pathological \n\ncondition (what could point to a vertical direction of the strength which caused the \n\ntrauma), could be the result of  a big strength projected over the back of the individual, \n\nwhich dislocated the ribs (some examples of possible causes would be: fall back from a \n\nconsiderable height, or over a hard surface, the impact of a heavy object falling over the \n\nback of the individual, etc). \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

Possibly, the infectious signs observed over the vertebrae, and which are \n\nespecially visible in the right side (same side in which the trauma is present), are a \n\ndirect consequence of the trauma.  \n\n \n\nPLATE 4.19.

Activity related stress markers. \n\nIn the case of the individual recovered in context 2247 (masculine young-middle adult), \n\nalso some interesting signs of occupational stress markers where registered in the \n\nshoulder articulation bones: new bone was growing in both scapulae, in the acromion \n\nprocess of both bone (Plate 4.21); but new bone was specially evident in both clavicles, \n\nover the ligament insertion areas (conoid and costoclavicular ligaments), and also \n\narround the attachment of the deloid muscle (as shown in Plate 4.22). \n\nThe literature (LAI, LOVELL, 1992, pp.224-226) refers to this cases as markers of \n\nocupational stress asociated with labours wich imply the reiterative movement of the \n\nshouders, such as the ones asociated with the typical circular movement in rowers, or in \n\nactivities sich as carring, lifting and padding. (in the case of Ille Cave, since the sea is \n\nnot inmediate to the site, we can point to these other activities). The hypertrophy of \n\nthese muscles requires a compensation from the bone, wich creates this new bone \n\narround the inserction areas for developeing a stronger conection with the muscle. \n\n \n\nPLATE 4.21.

INTERPRETATION AND CONTEXT OF ILLE CAVE PATHOLOGIES IN \n\nA GENERAL FRAMEWORK OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN BIOARCHAEOLOGY. \n\nThis chapter will focus on developing explanations referred to the pathologies registered \n\nin Ille Cave prehistoric population, already presented in Chapter 4 as the results of the \n\nanalysis. The establishment of interpretative models will be presented for some \n\nparticular pathologies which would require a deeper explanation that the ones referred \n\npreviously, since in Chapter 4 just descriptive approach was accomplished. Some of \n\nthese cases are the unusual teeth wear patterns registered in the assemblage (section \n\n5.2.4), which were studied in order to understand their causes, with positive results: \n\nsome interesting notes about the activities developed by these prehistoric societies could \n\nbe inferred from them. Also, other diseases such as the healed traumatisms present in \n\nthe assemblage (section 5.1.8) would lead the reader trough ideas about the accidental \n\norigins of the paleopathologies in Ille Cave, and also to understand some questions \n\nrelative to the perception of the pathological conditions among the people who \n\ninhabited the site during Prehistoric times, about some ideas relative to first aids or \n\nhealth care. \n\nIn every case, also a comparative analysis with other sites inside the Southeast Asia-\n\nPacific region will be committed, in order to offer the reader a basic idea about the \n\ncurrent status of the investigations and the knowledge we have about each group of \n\npathologies in the area, what also would help us to understand different dynamics \n\nrelated to the paleopathologies and the indicators of health care through all these \n\nextended area, in which different social models and ambiental responses will be noticed. \n\nFinally, after all this perspectival approaches to the pathologies registered, the work will \n\nbe closed with a final discussion about the health care perspective and the social and \n\nenvironmental implications about it in Ille Cave, crossing the osteological data collected \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

A critical approach to the present work \n\nwill be also provided, in the shape of a final section (section 5.5) which will offer some \n\ntasks which were not developed and which could be included as future perspectives or \n\nideas for future studies. \n\n5.2. DENTAL PATHOLOGY. \n\n? 5.2.1. Dental calculus and signs of buccal infection. \n\nAs may be observed in Chapter 4.3.1, the presence of calculus in the teeth of Ille Cave \n\nindividuals is present in all the studied cases, what is really normal in other prehistoric \n\nplaces of Southeast Asia for similar chronologies. A good example is the case of Non \n\nNok Tha, a good representative of the Neolithic and the Metal Ages (till the \n\npreangkorian Iron Age) of Thailand. This site, which we can recognize as an important \n\ncemetery area (just a few industrial and occupational episodes in all the stratigraphy, \n\nwhich offers a complete sequence from around 5000/4500 years BP to around 1800 \n\nBP), is a good example of the high rates of frequency of registered calculus in adults \n\n(TOOMAY DOUGLAS, 2006, pp.203-204). This possibly would be related to some \n\nkind of factors which would create an alkaline ambience in the mouth which would \n\nmake the dental plaque to appear easily or maybe to a poorer oral hygiene. In any Non \n\nNok Tha seems an interesting case, since the masculine individuals present calculus \n\nmuch more frequently than the females, although the explanation to this phenomenon is \n\nnot conclusive (in the case of Ille, the distribution doesn\u00b4t seem to response to gender \n\nreasons, affecting to all the cases without any distinction).  \n\nIf the advanced calculus is present in more than half part of the individuals of Non Nok \n\nTha, the alveolar resorption is present in almost the third part of the population \n\n(TOOMAY, DOUGLAS, 2006, pp.214), while in Ille Cave appears in almost every \n\ncase. This doesn\u00b4t mean in any case that Ille Cave shows a higher rate of frequency in \n\nperiodontal disease that the ones from the series of Non Not Tha: we need to insist \n\nagain in the fact that our skeletal remains are quite worst preserved, and also in the fact \n\nthat our statistical analysis can\u00b4t be achieved, since we made it just over 20 individuals \n\n(not enough for this kind of studies), so the representativeness of the individuals \n\nanalyzed inside of the collection is still a big question to be solved with the study of \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n99 \n \n\nother chronologies inside of the site and the recovery of other prehistoric human \n\nremains still buried. \n\nSome factors, that we will analyze latter for the case of the caries (vid infra: 4.2.2), can \n\nbe great enhancers for the presence of calculus in the dental pieces. The chewing of \n\nbetel nut and some dietary components (such as the water hardness or the presence of \n\nsilicon contents, present in rice or beer, for example) could explain the high profusion \n\nof the condition in Ille populations (TOOMAY DOUGLAS, 2006, pp.214). As we will \n\nsee in the next section of this chapter, the rice agriculture can\u00b4t explain the particular \n\ncase of Ille Cave (hasn\u00b4t been documented), but for example the betel nut has been \n\nregistered in several ways (MEDRANA, 2002, pp.44; CARLOS, 2010, pp.19). \n\n? 5.2.2. Dental caries. \n\nIs interesting to notice that several studies (ORTNER, 2003, pp.591; TOOMAY \n\nDOUGLAS, 2006, pp.191) have concluded that carious process are more typically \n\nassociated to agriculturalist societies, in which their frequency of appearing is much \n\nhigher than in the case of hunters-gatherers, as the result of the presence of more \n\nfermentable carbohydrates associated to the consumption of different species of plants.  \n\nAlthough, is important to introduce here an interesting idea that affects to Southeast \n\nAsia populations: the fact that the grasses and grains of rice, typically consumed by \n\nthese populations, are not as cariogenic as other plants consumed by other agriculturalist \n\nsocieties around the world (TOOMAY, DOUGLAS, 2006, pp.192). As a result of this \n\nfact, is true that normally the presence of caries manifest in a smaller amount in the \n\nosteological register from archaeological sites in this areas: proportionally, less \n\nindividuals present this condition in Southeast Asia sites. Some good examples in this \n\nsense are the few cases registered in the permanent dentition of Neolithic-Iron Age sites \n\nas Non Nok Tak in Thailand (TOOMAY, DOUGLAS, 2006, pp.203), which offers a \n\nlong chronology between 5000/4500 and 1800 BP, and where we can also observe the \n\nfact than the carious process are more frequent in the mandibular molars that in other \n\nparts of the mouth (actually in Ille Cave both the cases documented also appear in \n\nmandibular molars) and in the occlusal or interproximal surfaces of the teeth, as we \n\nreferred before. In Ille Cave, as introduced in Chapter 4.3.2, we have one case of each \n\nof these situations (occlusal and interproximal), so the pattern seems comparable. Also \n\nin the Bronze Age site of Ban Lum Khao or the pre-angkorian Iron Age site of Noen U-\n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

For example, multi-regional studies such as the ones carried out by \n\nMark Oxenham, who can give a good perspective about the very low frequencies of \n\ncarious lesions in the pre-agricultural (c.5000 BP) and rice-based agricultural (c.2500-\n\n1700 BP) period of Northern Vietnam, with ratios of frequency for carious lesions \n\nbetween 1.5% and 10.9%  in all the collections of these area, insisting again in the rice-\n\nbased diet explanation, and in which enumerates a long list of up to 12 sites which also \n\nshow a bigger frequency of carious lesions in the posterior mandibular teeth \n\n(OXENHAM, LAN CIJONG, KIM THUY, 2006, pp.274). \n\nThe problem that we have with the previous interpretation is the fact that rice \n\nagriculture has not yet been identified in the archaeological record of Ille Cave. \n\nTherefore, this generalized model for other regions can\u00b4t be applied to the particular \n\ncase of Ille. Maybe the low rate of carious lesions in Ille (present just in two of the eight \n\ncases of individuals which conserved dental pieces) could be explained as a result of the \n\nsmall sample size of human remains or the preservation status. Maybe trough other \n\nfactors which speak about dental care and hygiene, such as the consumption of betel nut \n\n(areca catechu), which has been documented in the paleobotanical record (CARLOS, \n\n2010, pp.19), but could also be indirectly inferred from the unusual teeth wear pattern of \n\none of the individuals in our study (section 4.2.5) and other previous studies of the \n\ndentition in Ille (MEDRANA, 2002, pp.44). The consumption of betel nut is quite \n\nfrequent in ancient Asian populations and especially documented in the case of the \n\nPhilippine archipelago, both through the archaeology (OXENHAM, LAN CIJONG, \n\nKIM THUY, 2006, pp.264) and the ethnographical records of the precolonial era \n\n(HENRY SCOTT, 1994, pp.49). The chewing of betel nut has been associated in the \n\nliterature with cariostatic properties (TOOMAY, DOUGLAS, 2006, pp.216), as the \n\naddition of lime to the chew results in an alkaline environment in the mouth which \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

While in Khok Phanom Di the high rate has been explained \n\nthrough the consumption of some cariogenic foods, such as the taro, the banana or the \n\nyam; the case of Man Bac remains a mystery. The introduction of rice in the diet of Man \n\nBac has been long documented, and their diet included more than 50% of seafood and \n\nfish, but no cariogenic food has been registered in their diet furthermore. Is important to \n\nintroduce here this case as an example of how much variables out of the topics exposed \n\nhere can be present in this kind of studies. \n\nIs also interesting to mention here an study (OXENHAM, LAN CIJONG, KIM THUY, \n\n2006, pp.273) which have allowed to determine that the presence of carious lesions is \n\nmore frequent between female individuals than in males for the case of Southeast Asian \n\npopulations, possibly not because of biological reasons (for example, the different \n\nrhythm in teeth exposure), but in relation to different cultural behaviors within the \n\npopulation: diversifications of activities by gender (women would be more linked to \n\nagricultural labors, while the males would maintain the hunter activities), or the \n\ndifferences of diet as a result of these labor links, since they would eat more \n\ncarbohydrates (they are more close to the products proceeding from the agriculture) and \n\nthe males more proteins (TOOMAY, DOUGLAS, 2006, pp.192). In this sense, the \n\nVietnamese sites of Man Bac and Da But are again a good example, since gender-\n\nrelated studies where committed (OXENHAM, MATSUMURA, KIM DUNG, 2010, \n\npp.87). Unfortunately in the case of Ille Cave, as stated (section 4.1.2), we can\u00b4t stablish \n\nany gender-related analysis as the assemblage doesn\u2019t present enough cases for a \n\nstatistical analysis, but we can state that both the caries samples that where noticed \n\nbelong to a clear male and a probable male individual. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

Dental enamel hypoplasia (DEH/LEH). \n\nAs could be appreciated in the previous chapter (Chapter 3.3.4), all the cases of DEH \n\ndetected in Ille Cave appeared in the frontal teeth (incisives and canines, a case of first \n\npremolars) of both mandible and maxilla. This prevalence in the frontal teeth is logical \n\naccording to the teeth formation patterns during childhood (giving us information about \n\nthe period between 7-12 years, when this teeth erupt, according to Ubelaker 1989: \n\nWHITE, BLACK, FOLKENS, 2012, pp.386), and actually is present in the rest of \n\nSoutheast Asia sites which will afford us a comparative study (vide infra), sites which \n\nalso focused their diagnosis process in the frontal dentition. \n\nAs we said, the presence of DEH in our studied assemblage is of 50% of the individuals \n\nin which we documented pathological conditions, or 62.5% if we attend to the \n\nindividuals in which dental pieces where still present (just 8 cases). This would position \n\nIlle Cave as a case study of high presence of DEH within its population, comparing to \n\nother Southeast Asia sites. Definitely not in the line of sites as Man Bac in Vietnam, \n\nwith a 100% of frequency ratio, or the neighbor Da But, with a 72% (OXENHAM, \n\nMATSUMURA, KIM DUNG, 2010, pp.90), both cases which we could consider as \n\nexceptional cases with too high rates. The case of Ille, instead, presents a percentage \n\nmore in the line of the general patterns: 37.1% in Shi San Hang (Taiwan), the Thai sites \n\nof Ban Chiang (20.8%) or Khok Phanom Di (43.8%), or even the percentage of 32.5% \n\nregistered in the Marianas Islands (PIETRUSEWSKY, TSANG, 2003, pp.212).  \n\nThese cases point always to a high presence of infant stress, but which we always have \n\nto understand inside of the parameters of the normality for this ancient societies, even \n\nwhen we find other specific cases in the region which point to societies with lower \n\ninfantile stress (Ban Lum Khao, with 12.1%, and Noen U-Loke, with 10.7%, are \n\ninteresting examples in Thailand preangkorian Bronze and Iron ages, especially in cases \n\nof big demographic index which will sustain the development of the Khmer empire; or \n\nthe prehistoric Hawaii, with just a 7.7% of cases of DEH: PIETRUSEWSKY, TSANG, \n\n2003, pp.212). \n\nIs necessary to remember again that the assemblage studied for the case of Ille was quite \n\nreduced for a representative statistical study, so we have to be cautious with this kind of \n\ncomparisons, which possibly will suffer modifications when more prehistoric sites are \n\nstudied in the Philippines. \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n103 \n \n\nAll the cited places, in fact, also offered interesting information about the differential \n\npresence of DEH between both sexes: in all the cases, female individuals presented \n\nDEH in quite bigger percentages that the ones for male individuals. In every case this \n\nwas explained from a plausible difference in the diet of the female children in \n\ncomparison with their male partners (PIETRUSEWSKY, TSANG, 2003, pp.210; \n\nOXENHAM, MATSUMURA, KIM DUNG, 2010, pp.90). Again, Ille can\u00b4t be \n\nintroduced in this kind of studies, since just a few individuals sustain the analysis and \n\nthe sexual diagnosis was not confident in many cases. \n\n? 5.2.4. Non-masticatory tooth wear patterns and their possible cultural-\n\nfunctional implications. \n\nAs was already introduced in Chapter 4.3.5, several unusual tooth wear patterns where \n\nnoticed in Ille Cave assemblage. The first of it, the one affecting the frontal mandibular \n\nteeth of the individuals recovered from context 755 and 2247, possibly would response \n\nto a practice of the use of the mouth as third hand in any kind of activity. \n\nSeveral paramasticatory activities have been documented for contemporaneous \n\naboriginal human groups, especially in the case of the Eskimos/Inuit and the Australian \n\naborigines. The same marks that the ones observed in our two individuals are related in \n\nthese groups to activities which imply the use of the mouth as third hand, and the action \n\nof pulling outward and downward with both hands over the object which they hold with \n\nthe frontal teeth (normally related to the treatment of animal skins for the manufacture \n\nof leathers, as can be observed in Plate 5.1). This non-masticatory pulling and stripping \n\nactivities produce a \u201crelative severe and often rounded wear\u201d on incisors and canines\u201d \n\n(HINTON, 1981, pp.556) of both Eskimos and Australian tribal groups, following \n\nexactly the same pattern that the one documented for the individuals from the contexts \n\n755 and 2247 of Ille Cave (Chapter 4.3.5). The Inuit case is quite evident, since women \n\nstill play the practice of softening the skin thought this pulling process, as we can see in \n\nPlate 5.1, while men perform different labors inside the community, more oriented to \n\nget the food by hunting (RAYE WOOD, 1992, pp.30). So furthermore we can recognize \n\nthe documentation of the use of the mouth as third hand in pulling and stripping \n\nactivities (possibly leather softening) in our site of study. \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

Pictures showing two Inuit women performing an activity which implies the use of the \n\nfrontal teeth as third hand: the chewing of animal skins. Below, dentition recovered from a \n\nprehistoric Eskimo site, in which we can observe the wear pattern left by this kind of activities \n\n(From: HINTON, 1981). \n\nIs interesting the fact that has been proved (TOOMAY, DOUGLAS, 2006, pp.191) that \n\nthe human groups which follow subsistence regimes typical in hunter-gatherer societies \n\n(like the ones referred, for example) tend to exhibit this relatively heavy wear in the \n\nfrontal dental pieces of adult individuals as a result of the use of the mouth as third \n\nhand, especially in the case of the mandibular teeth, with also this tendency to the \n\nrounded wear pattern (HINTON, 1981, pp.562-563). Meanwhile, groups which \n\nsomehow depend to varied degrees in food production present the molars quite more \n\nweared that in the hunter-gatherer societies, and the pattern in frontal dentition uses to \n\ngive the pieces a cupper wear appearance, linked to the grinding functions developed in \n\nthe frontal mouth area. This, together with the light presence of the caries and an only \n\ncase of AMTL would point, a priori and always according to this studies, to a hunter-\n\ngatherer economic model for Ille Cave, although the intrinsecal limitations of our study \n\n(small sample analyzed, not representative enough) and the particularities of the \n\nhttp://www.google.com.ph/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CAcQjRxqFQoTCIXyhqaMiscCFSQ2pgod02gAtw&amp;url=http://prezi.com/j-4ysjhr0gun/eskimos/&amp;ei=S-S9VcWgIaTsmAXT0YG4Cw&amp;bvm=bv.99261572,d.dGo&amp;psig=AFQjCNH6J6H9W-bgINYvGLVWUS7YSTA6ig&amp;ust=1438594501766199\nhttp://flickrhivemind.net/Tags/sealskin/Interesting\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n105 \n \n\nprehistoric societies of the Philippines have to make us feel cautious about this kind of \n\ndefinition (actually is really possible that we can be facing a mix economic model, as \n\nwe will observe in section 5.4). \n\nThe other unusual wear pattern registered in Ille Cave, as displayed before (Chapter \n\n4.3.5), affected the mandibular molars of the individual retrieved in the context 727. \n\nNormally, this wear patterns which affect so much the molar area but don\u00b4t affect the \n\nfrontal teeth are associated with several activities which involve the deeper dentition \n\n(MICKLEBURGH, 2007, pp.50-52), such as the following ones: \n\n- Crashing bones with the molars. \n\n- Killing fishes with a bite during fishing labors, or cracking crabs or shells. \n\n- Chewing hard rubbery aliments (for example, seal dry skin in Inuit populations, \n\nas we can see in the image below). \n\n- Consumption of hard nuts. \n\n- Some activities which pretend the creation of industries which require the \n\nchewing of lianas. \n\nAmong these options, the case of the chew of hard aliments was discarded immediately: \n\nthe diet in Ille Cave didn\u00b4t include any rubbery aliment, plus the bibliographical \n\nresearch allowed us to confirm that the wear pattern in this cases, although similar to the \n\none present in our individual, used to had more repercussion over the mesial and distal \n\nsurfaces of the teeth (in our case the disposition is lingual-buccal), as we can observe in \n\nPlate 5.2, from the Inuit site of Sadlermiut (RAYE WOOD, 1992, pp.136-138). \n\n \n\nPLATE 5.2. Image of the wear pattern shown in the mandibular molars of the individual 61 of the \n\narchaeological Inuit site of Sadlermiut: similar to the case from context 727 of Ille, but in this case \n\nexplained because the chew of hard-rubbery aliments (From: RAYE WOOD, 1992). \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n106 \n \n\nThe most probable option for the case of Ille Cave was the chew of nuts, since, as was \n\ndiscussed for the case of the carious formations of our assemblage (4.2.2), the chew of \n\nbetel nut (areca catechu) has been documented in Southeast Asian skeletal collections \n\nin similar patterns than the one been studied here (PIETRUSEWSKY, TOOMAY, \n\nDOUGLAS, 2011, pp.74), or in other close regions (FITZPATRICK, NELSON, \n\nREEVES, 2003). But has also been documented in Ille Cave in other previous dental \n\nanalysis (MEDRANA, 2002 pp.44), and also in the paleobotanical studies (CARLOS, \n\n2010, pp.19), as well as in the ethnographical register of prehispanic Philippines \n\n(HENRY SCOTT, 1994, pp.49) and other several cases of the region. In fact, some \n\nauthors have even documented the origins on the use of betel nut in the southern \n\nPhilippines (Visayas-Mindanao) and Borneo, with a posterior expansion to the rest of \n\nIsland Southeast Asia and the continental lands (FULLER et al., 2011). \n\nThis practice, quite common not also in prehistoric Asian populations, but even between \n\nthe contemporaneous indigenous people (in almost all the territory: Northern Palawan, \n\nVisayas, diverse regions of Mindanao and in the Cordillera region of central Luzon) \n\nuses to follow the same ritual: the preparation before the chewing process would start \n\nwith the cut of the areca palm nut into segments, which was wrapped in a leaf of betel \n\npiper vine, together with lime made of shells and other possible aromatic or flavoring \n\nelements (we ourselves could observe the use of tobacco leaves in this sense during our \n\nstance in the Cordillera region, but the ancient registers speak us also about the use of \n\ncinnamon sticks in the Visayas, just for give an example: HENRY SCOTT, 1994, \n\npp.49), giving as a result of the process the quid which would be chewed. This sequence \n\nof preparation and the materials used can be observed in Plate 5.3. \n\n \n\nPLATE 5.3.

Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n107 \n \n\nThe chew of betel nut has several properties which would explain why the Asian \n\npopulations would have introduced it as a habit. The main one is its cariostatic effect \n\n(TOOMAY, DOUGLAS, 2006, pp.216): the lime helps to develop an alkaline \n\nenvironment which prevents the appearance of carious lesions, as we saw before (vid \n\nsupra: 4.2.2). Unfortunately, this alkaline ambience makes easier the appearance of \n\ncalculus deposits over the teeth, dental infections process, etc (vid supra: 4.2.1). \n\nApart of the different pathologies which the consumption of betel nut would leave in the \n\nsoft tissues of the mouth and its mucosa (TRIVEDY, CRAIG, \n\nWARNAKULASURIYA, 2002), also different markers have been observed in the \n\ndental pieces of archaeological populations thought Asia: the wear pattern of our \n\nindividual would fix quite well inside this patterns, which are always present in the \n\nmolar area (being specially abrasive in the case of the last molar pieces, since the quid is \n\nchewed in the deeper part of the mouth) and over the buccal-labial surfaces (is chewed \n\nbetween the dentition and the cheeks, for avoiding choking, since after the process all \n\nthe remains of the chewed quid are spited out). The only problem we have in our case of \n\nstudy is that the remain enamel is not tinted in the typical reddish coloration (Plate 5.4), \n\nas in other cases of Ille Cave (MEDRANA, 2002 pp.44) or other archaeological \n\nregisters, but could be the result of a strong chemical attrition or postdepositional \n\nprocess (actually the exposed pulps are quite orange-colored, but not much enamel is \n\npresent, so we can\u00b4t determine clearly the coloration of it). So, furthermore, we can \n\nconclude a possible, but not definitive, case of non-dietary chewing of betel nut for the \n\nindividual from the context 727. \n\nAlthough is true that this betel nut consumption case was registered in a probable \n\nfemale individual, and the frontal teeth wear pattern appeared in two males (a definite \n\nmale and a probable one: vid supra), we can\u00b4t speak about the division of these labors or \n\npractices between genders in Ille, since the activity patterns are not representative \n\nenough (just three cases in a small group of 20 individuals studied). Maybe deeper \n\nstudies in the future could allow us to commit this kind of studies in the prehistoric \n\nPhilippines archipelago. \n\n \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

Study cases as the \n\nones committed over several central Thailand sites of the Metal Period (LIU, 2012, \n\npp.374-375 - Several sites; DOMETT, O\u00b4REILLY, 2009, pp.72 - Phum Snay) shown \n\nthat, between other several factors (age, genetics, physical condition), the degeneration \n\nprocess in the column and, more specifically, the vertebral osteoarthritis, can be also a \n\nresponse to activities which induct stress over the anatomical region: a good example is \n\nthe site of Non Mak La, in which 19 individuals reported degenerative joint diseases, \n\nand in which the agriculture labors and the transport of weight can explain perfectly the \n\npresence of this pathological conditions in the column of the skeletons. Even if this \n\npresence of the columnar affections is, as said before, recurrent, sites as Ban Mai \n\nChaimongkol or Ban Pong Manao (LIU, 2012, pp.241) shown that other areas can be \n\naffected (in the case of Ban Mai Chaimongkol, 4 individuals present degenerative joint \n\ndisease in the column, but also a case in the shoulder and another one in the knee where \n\ndocumented; in Ban Pong Manao, aside of the 5 columnar cases, one in a hip and three \n\nin the feet). In this sense, the most typical areas affected are wrist/hands, as a \n\nconsequence of the ceramic manufacture labors (LIU, 2012, pp.375; DOMETT, 2001, \n\nChapter 5); the feet, as the result of intense locomotion (as in Bun Lum Kao: DOMETT, \n\n2001); or the shoulders, possibly because of paddling activities (DOMETT, 2001, \n\nChapter 5). \n\nAgain, the case of Ille Cave presented here doesn\u00b4t allow a comparative study, nor the \n\nrelation of the conditions to any specific practice. \n\n? 5.3.3. Infectious diseases. \n\nAs presented in Chapter 4.4.3, two of the 20 individuals analyzed also presented cases \n\nof infectious diseases: a case of osteomyelitis in the individual from context 703, and \n\nsigns of periostitis and pubic osteitis (together with other smaller markers of non-\n\nspecific infectious process) in the individual from context 2247. \n\nThe literature about infectious diseases in Southeast Asia is still quite brief for allow a \n\ncomparative study, although the team of Marc Oxenham, which worked in several sites \n\nin Northern Vietnam, has already noticed some interesting facts in the area. According \n\nto his study, carried on over 96 individuals of the Da But period (Neolithic) and other \n\n96 individuals from the Metal Age phases of several close sites in the same region \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n111 \n \n\n(OXENHAM, KIM THUY, LAN CUONG, 2005, pp.372-373), the infectious diseases \n\nare present in a small proportion in the Neolithic times (just 1/96 cases of the studied \n\nassemblage), while in the Metal Period their presence increases considerably (10/96 \n\ncases). He explains this increase because of the presence of new pathogen agents, which \n\nappeared with the sedentary way of life and the domestication of some animal species, \n\nand which become more virulent trough time, being especially strong during the Metal \n\nPeriod because of the demographical growth. Other recent studies of the same author, \n\nfor sites such as Ban Chiang, continue pointing in the same direction \n\n(PIETRUSEWSKY, TOOMAY DOUGLAS, 2011, pp.169-171). \n\nUnfortunately, not much more studies have been done about infectious diseases in other \n\nareas of Southeast Asia yet, although the incoming publications of other Vietnamese \n\nsites (soon the well-studied Man Bac, for example) hopefully would ease the \n\ndevelopment of the bibliography by other teams working in other regions. \n\nIn the case of Ille Cave, with a presence of infectious diseases of 10%, can\u00b4t be \n\nconcluded yet how representative this proportion is of the real situation (note: two cases \n\nover a sample of 20 individuals). Is necessary, in this sense, to continue studying other \n\nindividuals recovered on the site for a better statistic, plus compare it with other \n\nPhilippine sites which could contribute to this point of view about the infections in the \n\nPrehistoric Southeast Asia which is still under construction.  \n\nFor conclude, can be noticed that the diseases present in the studied assemblage are \n\nquite normal and well known in the archaeological register for other areas (in fact, the \n\nperiostitis is the most typically registered between the infectious diseases: ROBERTS, \n\nMANCHESTER, 2010, pp.417), so the results shouldn\u2019t surprise the reader in this \n\nsense, since are within the parameters of normality. \n\n? 5.3.4. Healed fractures (trauma). \n\nThree cases of healed fractures were also presented in Chapter 4.4.4. The first of these \n\ncases was the healed nasal fracture in the individual from context 2247. Normally this \n\nkind of contusions are quite representative in cases of interpersonal violence or as a \n\nresult of accidents from everyday activities which are conducted in an inhospitable \n\nenvironment (as in Plate 5.5; TORRES-ROUFF, COSTA-JUNQUEIRA, \n\nLLAGOSTERA, 2005, pp.78), but in any case couldn\u00b4t be determined exactly what \n\ncaused this injury, although it seems the consequence of a lateral impact. Anyway, as \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n112 \n \n\nwe will observe in the other healed fractures, seems logical to understand that in Ille \n\nCave couldn\u00b4t be registered any phase of strong social violence, since just a few cases \n\nwhere documented and in all of them the fact than the fractures where healed pointed to \n\nsituations of social care. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPLATE 5.5. Some examples of nasal fractures from the archaeological site of Coyo Oriente, \n\nAtacama Desert, Chile (pre-Tiwanaku). Notice the misaligned overlapping bonny fragments in the \n\nupper image, and the horizontal fracture in the inferior one, similar to our case of study (From: \n\nLESSA, MENDO\u00c7A DE SOUZA, 2006, pp.135; TORRES-ROUFF, COSTA-JUNQUEIRA, \n\nLLAGOSTERA, 2005, pp.78). \n\n \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n113 \n \n\nThe second healed trauma documented is a healed oblique fracture in the left femur of \n\nthe individual recovered in context 1825. This kind of trauma would have clearly \n\naffected to the mobility of the individual for the rest of his life time (WEBB, 1995, \n\npp.198), so we could infer here questions related to his care from the rest of the \n\ncommunity. Obviously this kind of fracture would have resulted in the fact than this leg \n\nwas shorter than the opposite limb, producing locomotional disturbances, or even \n\nmaking impossible the movement of the individual. Although we can notice little \n\nattempt or lack of success in reducing this fracture, given the overlapping heal process \n\n(presumable lack of first aids: WEBB, 1995, pp.196), is true that this individual \n\nsurvived at least till the fracture was completely healed (process which takes at least 10 \n\nmonths), so some help from his partners would have been required for his subsistence \n\n(maybe he was not able to provide food anymore cause of this condition, but was able to \n\ncontribute to the community life otherwise). \n\nIn the same sense would point the third case of trauma registered in the assemblage: the \n\ncostovertebral trauma of the individual from context 484. If the healed femoral fracture \n\nwould have, somehow, made more difficult the locomotion of the individual who \n\nsuffered it, this case seems even worst: the dislocated superior ribs of the right side of \n\nthe thorax, accumulated over the 8\nth\n\n rib after the trauma, would have been a clearly \n\nfocus of strong pain and infections (as show the different signs of the process registered \n\nin the column). The thoracic cage would have partially lost his shape, making the \n\nmovement really painful, if not impossible, for an individual which surely survived \n\nenough time for allow the ribs to react trough the growth of new bone tissue, around \n\ntheir extremity of insertion with the column, creating the several flat surfaces which can \n\nbe observed now in the bones and which showed the overlapping between bones which \n\nallowed the reassemblage of the thoracic cage.  \n\nUnfortunately not much more bones of this individual where present, so that was not \n\npossible to infer potential consequences of this strong trauma in other parts of the \n\norganism couldn\u00b4t be noticed (the few bones present didn\u00b4t show any kind of \n\npathological marker). Although, if the case of the healed femoral fracture already \n\noffered some ideas about the lack of knowledge of first aids in Ille Cave communities, \n\nin this case the idea becomes stronger: logical, since the reduction of a femoral fracture \n\nseems a much more simple proceeding that the stabilization of several dislocated ribs. \n\nIn a more positive sense, as in the femoral case, this strong thoracic trauma is again a \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n114 \n \n\nprove than the community had a perception of the health care which worked much \n\nbetter in long terms: the individual survived, at least for some time, and of course this \n\nwould have been impossible without the support of a community which took care of \n\nhim, and was able to understand his importance furthermore the fact that maybe was not \n\nso \u201cuseful\u201d for the daily activities anymore. \n\nIn a more general sense, the bibliographical references we have about traumatic lesions \n\nin Southeast Asia are quite brief, and normally referring to archaeological sites in which \n\nthe presence of this kind of pathologies is more representative because of specific social \n\ndynamics. A good example in this sense are sites as Phum Snay, in Cambodia, where \n\nthe high rates of traumatic lessons in the skull and facial area have been interpreted as \n\nthe results of convulse times which would lead to the establishment of the Angkorian \n\nreign, times in which the interpersonal violence markers and the frequent appearance of \n\nweaponry in archaeological contexts (DOMETT, O\u00b4REILLY, BUCKLEY, 2011). Also \n\nthe Indus Valley civilizations (Harappa, Mohenjo-Daro: 2600-1900 BP) are a great \n\nexample of high rates of traumatic lesions (especially nasal fractures, as the one we \n\nregistered in Ille Cave, and which together with the injuries of the cranial vault appear \n\nin up to 15,5% of Harappa necropolis) linked to violent periods associated with the \n\nformation of big states (ROBBINS SCHUG, GRAY, MUSHRIF-TRIPATHY, \n\nSANKHYAN, 2012, pp.9). \n\nIf we leave apart these specific cases of convulsions over big demographically \n\ndeveloped societies, the general pattern for the prehistoric incidence of traumatic lesions \n\nis Southeast Asia gets significantly reduced. During the Neolithic of sites as Ban Chiang \n\nin Thailand (PIETRUSEWSKY, TOOMAY DOUGLAS, 2002, pp-170-171), the \n\npresence of trauma is explained as the result of ambience and accidental origins, given \n\nthe much more random distribution in the sequence for this period. In the posterior \n\nphases of the same site, we can observe that actually the presence of traumatisms \n\nincreases significantly during the Bronze Age, possibly as consequence of the \n\nintensification of the agriculture, the sedentary lifestyle and the bigger population \n\ndensity, but in any case never with such a presence as the one documented from the \n\npreangkorian Iron or the Indus Valley. In the same sense, we have several sites in \n\nVietnam (OXENHAM, 2006, pp.227), as the case of Da But, in which the presence of \n\ntransverse fractures of the midshaft femur with diaphyseal overlapping (like the one we \n\nregistered in Ille context 1825) just arrives to a 6,5% (being one of the biggest rates in \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n115 \n \n\nthe region of study), a percentage than together with the low presence of weaponry in \n\nthe site allowed the scientist to infer that the traumatism in this sites proceeded from \n\naccidental falls or even animal attacks (OXENHAM, 2006, pp.232). Island sites, as the \n\nones previously treated for Taiwan (PIETRUSEWSKY, TSANG, 2003) continue \n\npointing to these lower rates. \n\nAlso, comparative studies such as the ones accomplished in Thailand sites for the \n\ntransition from Neolithic to Bronze Age (Khok Phanom Di, Nong Nor, Ban Lum Khao, \n\nBan Na Di: DOMETT, TAYLES, 2006b, pp.190) show again this idea that the fractures \n\nin the bones are more frequent with the intensification of the agriculture, possibly as a \n\nresult of the presence of activities directed to create new spaces for developing this \n\nactivities (DOMETT, TAYLES, 2006b, pp.198-199), while the few cases of facial \n\nfractures start to be significant in the later phases, as a result of possible cases of \n\ninterpersonal violence (DOMETT, TAYLES, 2006b, pp.203-204). \n\nThe case of Ille Cave possibly would point to accidental-origin traumas: the \n\ncostovertebral and femoral fractures registered are cases which point in this sense, since \n\nwe have no evidence of particular moments of social convulsions. The hunting practice \n\nand its locomotional implications, as well as the landscape (geological relief), are two \n\nfactors to take in account for trying to explain the small presence of bone trauma in the \n\nassemblage, which furthermore was healed in every case (the misaligned healed \n\nfractures would point to a lack of knowledge about first aids, but at the same time to the \n\npreoccupation by the rest of the community). We can\u00b4t determine if the case of nasal \n\nfracture has its origin in an accident or in interpersonal violence, since is just one case \n\nover 20 individuals analyzed, but again we insist that the presence of trauma (3/20 \n\nindividuals) points to an accidental origin more than to internal social fights. Again, the \n\nfact that the stratigraphic sequence is so difficult to interpret, and that our study just \n\nfocus on a small part of the osteological assemblage in the site, together with the fact \n\nthat we had no signs of rice agriculture practice in the site, made impossible \n\nevolutionary analysis as the ones explained for mainland Southeast Asia. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n116 \n \n\n5.4. CONCLUSION: SOME IDEAS ABOUT THE HEALTH AND THE \n\nLIFESTYLE OF ILLE CAVE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS. \n\nFrom the present work, some basic conclusions can be extracted here relative to the \n\nlifestyle and the health care in the prehistoric populations from Ille Cave: \n\n? The main objective of our study, the assessment of the evidence of pathological \n\nlesions in the prehistoric populations of Ille Cave, clearly succeeded, as the \n\nresults exposed in Chapter 4 and Annex III can prove. \n\n? In relation to the dental pathologies registered in Ille assemblage, is interesting \n\nto notice the frequent presence of periodontal disease and calculus, which appear \n\nin almost all the individuals, as explained in section 5.2.1. This could be a \n\nconsequence of the frequent use of elements such as the lime from the betel nut, \n\nwhich creates an alkaline environment in the mouth which facilitates the \n\npresence of these conditions. Although, is important to say here that in other \n\nsimilar sites from Southeast Asia, as the ones used in the present study for the \n\ncomparative, the presence of both this conditions is also a constant, which could \n\nalso be interpreted from the absence of dental hygiene. In this sense, Ille Cave is \n\ninside the parameters of what can be considered a normal pattern. \n\n? The chew of betel nut (section 5.2.4), which was already proved for Ille Cave \n\nbefore the development of the present work (MEDRANA, 2002), has also \n\nbenefits for the dental health, such as the cariogenic properties: in this sense, \n\nmaybe some ideas about dental care could be inferred for this population, \n\nalthough is true that its consumption could be the result of other factors (cultural \n\nreasons, avoid the altitude sickness, vice). This could explain the low rates of \n\ncarious lesions in the assemblage studied (5.2.2), which furthermore is \n\ncomparable to other sites of Southeast Asia in which the low rates can be \n\nexplained by the introduction of rice as dietary base (in Ille there are no signs of \n\nrice agriculture). \n\n? The fact that the people of Ille used their teeth as third hand in the development \n\nof some kind of cultural-economical activities has been proved trough the \n\nanalysis of the non-masticatory wear patterns of the frontal teeth in two of the \n\nindividuals studied, as displayed also in section 5.2.4. This pattern is normally \n\nassociated with activities which are normally developed by hunter-gatherers \n\nsocieties. \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n117 \n \n\n? Some metabolic disturbances can be observed also in the adult individuals which \n\norigins we have to search in the childhood. The DEH (see section 5.2.3) points \n\nto this kind of disturbances, normally related to diet, in an interval between 7 \n\nand 12 years old (the time in which the frontal definitive teeth erupt). \n\nMeanwhile, the case of cribra orbitalia points to a particular case of anemia or \n\nlack of vitamin B-12 (still in debate) during the sub-adult times, as discuses in \n\nsection 5.3.1. Both this cases can point to dietary disturbances associated to the \n\nyounger periods of the life of Ille people. \n\n? Some other pathologies, such as the trauma (5.3.4), can be understood also \n\ninside the normal patterns for this kind of societies, as shows the comparison of \n\nIlle Cave ratios of presence with the ones from the other Southeast Asian sites \n\ndescribed. Their reduced presence can be a sign of the accidental origin of the \n\nconditions, together with the fact that no determinative signs of interpersonal \n\nviolence or conflicts have been noticed in Ille Cave, as discussed in section \n\n5.3.4. \n\n? The environment around Ille Cave is also an important factor to take into \n\naccount: the geological relief (for example in the karst itself), the profuse forest \n\nwhich covers the territory (CARLOS, 2010, pp.90-91) or the presence of savage \n\nanimals which could actually wound the inhabitants during their quotidian \n\nlabors of hunting, such as big mammals and possibly felines (OCHOA, 2009, \n\npp.111-112), are just some examples of a risky ambience which could become \n\nhostile enough for causing the pathologies present in the assemblage. \n\n? In this sense, the present work proves that, nowadays, we have no signs of the \n\npractice of first aids over this presumably accidental injuries (actually no one of \n\nthe registered traumas was reduced, as explained in section 5.3.4); although the \n\nconsumption of medicinal plants and the possibility of palliative cares could be a \n\nreality. Actually, several plants have been documented in Ille Cave which have \n\nmedical properties (CARLOS, 2010, pp.55): buchanania arborescens, \n\ntraditionally used for healing wounds and cuts; eupatorium odoratum, for skin \n\nwounds and reducing the fever; or eleusine indica, another febrifuge. \n\n? What seems clear is that, in cases such as the femoral fracture or the hard \n\ncostovertebral trauma (5.3.4), the growth of the bone (which completely healed, \n\nalthough misaligned, the femoral fracture, and which was also present in the \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n118 \n \n\ncostovertebral case) demonstrates that the individuals survived to this injuries, \n\nwhich would have made them incapable at least for some time. The long term \n\ncare of these individuals by the community seems logical and proves that, at \n\nsome point, there was some concern about the pain of the others and the \n\npresence of these unfortunate conditions as part of their daily lives. \n\n? All this notes could be understood from the perspective of a mix economic \n\nmodel: hunter-gatherers which had some punctual domesticated plants and \n\nanimals, but which still have the forest resources as first focus of their activities \n\nand main source of their food and raw materials, what would imply the necessity \n\nof movement around the territory, and so the exposure to possible risks which \n\ncould cause the injuries.  \n\n? This idea of an economical model based in the forest resources was already \n\nnoticed in previous works on Ille Cave, such as the study of the macrobotanical \n\nremains (CARLOS, 2010, pp.90). Actually, the current tribal populations of \n\nNorthern Palawan, the Tagbanwa and Batak peoples (DRESSLER, 2005; \n\nBOISSI\u00c8RE, LISWANTI, 2006), still maintain this model which combines the \n\nhunting/fishing and gathering of natural resources in the inland forest with \n\npunctual domestication of animals and a little non-monocrop horticulture \n\n(swidden farming: small surfaces in the forest which they burnt, plant and \n\nabandon after the land loses fertility). In Plate 5.6 we can see some sample \n\nimages of the Batak people performing these subsistence activities. \n\n? Furthermore, no signs of sexual diversification where registered in Ille, neither \n\nfor the pathological conditions, nor for the possible activities registered, as \n\ndisplayed in Chapter 4. This could represent the reality or be just a consequence \n\nof the reduced assemblage selected as sample for this work.  \n\n? In the same sense, the lack of absolute data in Ille Cave site for the layers \n\nstudied makes impossible any case of evolutionary study about the health \n\nperceptions, as was also discussed in Chapter 4. \n\n \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

FUTURE PERSPECTIVES OF THIS LINE OF INVESTIGATION. \n\nFor finishing the present work, some ideas or future perspectives related to the facts \n\nwhich were exposed in the main text can be concluded here: \n\n? Since not all the cases of the assemblage studied where sexed or aged with the \n\nmethods selected, maybe the use of other ways of approximation would be \n\nsuccessful: the sex determination methods based on teeth analysis seems \n\nplausible for the particular case of Ille, since several cases presented here \n\npreserved the dentition (good references about some of this methods can be \n\nfound in WHITE, FOLKENS, 2005, pp.387); and about the ageing of the \n\nindividuals, the analysis of the sternal rib end or the radiographic analysis of \n\nsome bone groups (WHITE, FOLKENS, 2005, pp.381) seem good examples \n\nwhich perfectly could be accomplished in Ille bone assemblage. \n\n? This possibility of sexing and ageing more individuals could be interesting for \n\ntrying to infer patterns which could relate the presence of paleopathologies and \n\nactivity markers with sex and age groups. \n\n? Would be interesting also to expand the study about Ille Cave paleopathologies \n\nto other chronologies: the comparison of the pathologies registered in the present \n\nwork with the ones proceeding from the cremation cemetery or a potential study \n\nof the colonial phase would give us interesting results from the perspective of \n\nthe evolution of the health in the population which inhabited Ille in a wide \n\nchronological point of view. \n\n? In the same sense, the comparison with the pathologies documented in the sub-\n\nadults individuals from Ille would give us new information about this life period, \n\nand also would allow us to understand better some pathologies which were \n\npresented here (cribra orbitalia, DEH) and which pointed to possible cases of \n\nmalnutrition during the childhood. Fortunately, the researcher Jessica Pe\u00f1a, from \n\nthe ASP, is currently working on it, and the results of her master thesis \n\n(provisional title: Taphonomical analysis and bone representation on non-adult \n\nindividuals of Ille Cave and Rockshelter, Palawan) will be presented soon. \n\n? Also, for understanding better the activity patterns of Ille archaeological \n\npopulations, an interesting work is being developed currently in the ASP: the \n\nresearcher Sarah Agatha Villaluz is currently studying entheseal changes \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

Would be also potentially interesting to develop an archaeological-\n\nethnographical based study of the said medicinal plans recovered from the site \n\n(section 5.4), in order to understand the use of them and other cases in the \n\ncurrent populations of Palawan island and try to understand if actually they \n\nwhere used in prehistoric times, what also would offer an interesting perspective \n\nabout the conscience of health care in Ille Cave. \n\n? Also, dietary studies could be accomplished in the future trough the skeletal \n\nassemblage from Ille. In this sense, since the dental calculus deposits are present \n\nin the majority of teeth of the assemblage chosen for the present study, and in \n\nsome cases these deposits seem to be considerable (although for the present \n\nwork the quantification of calculus was not accomplished), and since calculus is \n\nknown to be a really good source of information on paleodietary reconstructions, \n\nseems reasonable to take them as an starting point for potential investigations. \n\nTheir observation with scanning electron microscope (SEM), isotopic analysis \n\nor even phytolith analysis (which also would offer information related to \n\npaleoenvironment) would definitely offer valuable information about the \n\nlifestyle of Ille Cave prehistoric inhabitants. \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

The atlas (C1) is \n\npresent, but just the vertebral arch, and in the case of the \n\naxis (C2) just appeared a fragment corresponding to the \n\nvertebral body and the odontoid process. C3 and C4 are \n\nalso present and almost complete (except of a small \n\nfragment of the transverse process in both cases). Finally, \n\nC5-C7 are all represented but really fragmented. \n\nVertebrae (12 thoracic) All the thoracic vertebrae are also represented. From T1-3 \n\nwas preserved the complete vertebral arches, excluding the \n\nleft transverse process in the three of them. None of the \n\nvertebral bodies from T1-3 where found. In the case of T4, \n\na fragment of the vertebral body is still preserved together \n\nwith the vertebral arch, which in this case has lost the \n\nspinous process. T5 repeats the conservation status from \n\nT1-3, but in this case the missing transverse process is the \n\nright one. T6-7 and T9 present the complete vertebral arch \n\nstill together with fragments of the vertebral bodies. T8 \n\ninstead just preserves the frontal edge of the vertebral body \n\nand the right transverse process. T10 and T11 preserves \n\ncomplete the vertebral body and almost all the complete \n\nvertebral arch. Finally, T12 misses almost all the vertebral \n\narch (just preserved a fragment of the right transverse \n\nprocess), but preserved all the external edges of the \n\nvertebral body (which central part is also missing). \n\nVertebrae (5 lumbar) All of them are present and complete, in quite a good \n\nconservation status. \n\nRibs (12 right) All of them are present, but some fragments are missing \n\n(normally from the frontal edges, since the heads and the \n\nneck are perfectly represented in all cases). \n\nRibs (12 left) All of them are present, but some fragments are missing \n\n(normally from the frontal edges, since the heads and the \n\nneck are perfectly represented in all cases). \n\nSternum Missing. \n\nSacrum Present, almost complete. Well preserved. \n\nCoccyx Missing. \n \n\n? UPPER LIMB: \n\nBone Description \n\nScapula (right) Preserved a big fragment which represents around the 30% of the \n\ntotal bone. Is preserved all the area around the articulation with the \n\narm (including the acromion, the glenoid fossa and the \n\ninfraglenoid tubercle and the scapular neck), but not the coracoid \n\nprocess. \n\nScapula (left) Similar case to the previous one, but in this case is missing the \n\ninferior half part of the glenoid cavity and a big part of the scapular \n\nneck. \n\nClavicle (right) Present, really well preserved, except the sternal articulation \n\nsurface. \n\nClavicle (left) Present, really well preserved, except the sternal articulation \n\nsurface. \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

The head of the bone is separated in a different fragment, \n\nand also the medial side of the distal epiphysis (from half part of \n\nthe trochlea till the medial supracondylar crest, including all the \n\nmedial epicondyle). The lateral epiphysis is missing. \n\nHumerus (left) Same conservation status than the one observed for the right \n\nhumerus, but in this case is missing all the distal epiphysis from \n\nthe medial supracondylar edge. \n\nUlna (right) Present, divided in two fragments, but all the proximal epiphysis is \n\nmissing. \n\nUlna (left) Present, almost complete. Fragmented in the proximal epiphysis, \n\nwhich is preserved in a separated fragment. The tissue around the \n\narea is so damaged that is impossible to connect both pieces again. \n\nRadius (right) Present, almost complete, but the proximal epiphysis is missing \n\n(except of a small fragment of the head, which was recovered). \n\nRadius (left) Present, but just the diaphysis (both epiphysis are missing). \n \n\n?

AGE DETERMINATION: \n\nMethod of the epiphyseal closure (MCKERN, STEWARD; 1957): Not applicable \n\n(all the epiphyses used in this method are missing). \n\nMethod of the cranial suture closure (MEINDL, LOVEJOY; 1985): Not applicable \n\n(sutures are all disconnected and so fragmented that the cranial vault can\u00b4t be \n\nreconstructed). \n\nMethod of the dental eruption development (UBELAKER; 1989): The third molars \n\nfrom the maxilla have already erupted, and so does the one of the right side of the \n\nmandible. The one of the left mandibular side, instead, seems not yet erupted: the root is \n\nstill growing (we can see the cut in the apical extreme of it, not yet developed), and the \n\nalveolar surface of the mandible shows how the dental piece would fix in an \n\nintermediate grown position. Also, no calculus is shown yet in this dental piece (the \n\nonly, possibly cause was still half-hidden). According to the method, this would include \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n172 \n \n\nthe individual in an age interval between 15+/-3 years old (when the roots start \n\ngrowing) and 21 years old (when the molar has already erupted), so a SUBADULT \n\nindividual or a YOUNG ADULT in its first years. Taking in account that all the other \n\nmolars are already erupted, and that this one almost should be as well (root almost \n\ncomplete, ascending position in the mandible of the piece, etc), we would point more to \n\nthe second case, with an age or circa 21 years old. \n\nMethod of the dental wear analysis (BROTHWELL; 1981): The enamel of M1 and \n\nM2 is starting to be affected, starting to appear flat surfaces over the crowns, but M3 \n\nseems still intact in both mandibular and maxillary sides. Also, the dentine is not \n\nappearing in any of the molar pieces. According to Brothwell, this wear pattern could \n\ndetermine an age of 17-25 years old, so it points to a YOUNG/SUBADULT-YOUNG \n\nADULT individual. \n\nMethod of the pubic simphyseal surface (SUCHEY, BROOKS; 1990): Not \n\napplicable (pelvic griddle is missing). \n\nMethod of the auricular surface of the ilium (LOVEJOY et al.; 1985): Not \n\napplicable (pelvic griddle is missing). \n\nWe can conclude than the age rate of the context 67 individual of Ille Cave corresponds \n\nto a YOUNG ADULT individual, possibly of around 21 years old, so an individual \n\nwhich possibly just left the puberty behind. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

AGE DETERMINATION: \n\nMethod of the epiphyseal closure (MCKERN, STEWARD; 1957): Since the only \n\npreserved epiphysis in this individual are the ones located in the scapula (scapular \n\nacromion and scapular medial border), and since both of them are fused around 23 years \n\nold, this method allow us to determine than the individual had, as minimal, this age. So \n\nwe seem to be facing, an ADULT INDIVIDUAL. \n\nMethod of the cranial suture closure (MEINDL, LOVEJOY; 1985): Not applicable \n\n(skull is missing). \n\nMethod of the dental eruption development (UBELAKER; 1989): Not applicable \n\n(dentition is missing). \n\nMethod of the dental wear analysis (BROTHWELL; 1981): Not applicable \n\n(dentition is missing). \n\nMethod of the pubic simphyseal surface (SUCHEY, BROOKS; 1990): Not \n\napplicable (pelvic griddle is missing). \n\nMethod of the auricular surface of the ilium (LOVEJOY et al.; 1985): Not \n\napplicable (pelvic griddle is missing). \n\nWe can conclude than the age rate of the context 484 individual of Ille Cave \n\ncorresponds to an ADULT individual, but we can\u00b4t be more precise about the age. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

Since the \n\ncranial skeleton offers us a wider variety of features to analyze, and (with just an \n\nexception) they use to point to feminine dimorphic morphologies, we can consider the \n\ncontext 727 individual as a PROBABLE FEMALE INDIVIDUAL. \n\n? AGE DETERMINATION: \n\nMethod of the epiphyseal closure (MCKERN, STEWARD; 1957): Since the sternal \n\nepiphysis of the clavicles are not conserved (last epiphysis to get fused in the human \n\nskeleton), the higher age rate which we can determine for the context 727 corresponds \n\nto a minimal of 22-23 years (so a YOUNG ADULT), since the epiphysis which fuse \n\nbefore (scapular acromion, humeral proximal end, distal ulna) are completely closed \n\naround this age. \n\nMethod of the cranial suture closure (MEINDL, LOVEJOY; 1985): Not applicable \n\n(fragmented skull). \n\nMethod of the dental eruption development (UBELAKER; 1989): Since the third \n\nmolar is already erupted, we can assume more than 21 years for the individual, which \n\nmakes it to be a YOUNG ADULT. \n\nMethod of the dental wear analysis (BROTHWELL; 1981): In the maxillary the \n\nthree molars are quite worn, affected mainly in the inner part of the crown, in which the \n\nenamel is missing (maintained the periferical enamel). This should correspond to an age \n\nratio of 25-35 years old (YOUNG ADULT?), but in the mandible all the molars are \n\nmuch more worn, losing completely the enamel, especially in the case of the third molar \n\n(which would surround the age to an older individual). Possibly this is because of \n\ndietary reasons, so in this case the method is not too much dependable. \n\nMethod of the pubic simphyseal surface (SUCHEY, BROOKS; 1990): Not \n\napplicable (just preserved a fragment of the right side pubic symphysis, which doesn\u00b4t \n\ngive enough information). \n\nMethod of the auricular surface of the ilium (LOVEJOY et al.; 1985): Is just \n\npreserved the auricular surface of the right ilium, but the conservation status seems quite \n\ngood. Since the porosity of the surface is already lost (seems quite flat beside the \n\nconcretions) and there is no presence of deterioration process associated to the elderly \n\n(porosity, lipping, etc), we can determine than the individual would be in the phases 5 \n\nor 6 proposed by Lovejoy et al., but we can\u00b4t determine the level of densification of the \n\nsurface clearly cause the taphonomical problematic. That\u2019s why this method results in \n\nan age of 40-49 years old, which corresponds to a MIDDLE ADULT. \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

TRAUMA. \n\nThis individual presented evidence of paleopathological conditions in the costovertebral \n\narea, in the right side of the thorax (the ribs of the left side are missing): \n\n- Vertebrae: all the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae preserved, from T8 to L1, \n\npresented signs of possible infection, especially profuse in the right side, around \n\nthe area of insertion of the corresponding ribs. The area appeared covered with \n\nporosity and reactive bone, plus some thin osteophytes which were projected out \n\nof the vertebral bodies (possible ossification of the radiated ligaments, which \n\nhold the articulations of each rib with the corresponding vertebra). \n\n- Ribs: all the ribs preserved, from the 2\nnd\n\n rib and till the 11\nth\n\n one, presented an \n\nirregular shape on their heads, around the articulation process with the vertebral \n\ncolumn. In all the cases new bone growth around the heads, which deformed the \n\noriginal shape of the cortical surfaces. This new tissue growth in interior \n\ndirection, extending the bone head and the beginning of the rib bodies inside the \n\nthoracic cage, creating flat-shaped surfaces. In some other cases (5\nth\n\n, 6\nth\n\n, 9\nth\n\n, 10\nth\n\n \n\nribs), the surface of the new bone presented negative semicircular marks, which \n\ncould point to the overlap of another structure which made impossible the \n\ngrowth of the bone in this direction, being a limitation for it. Finally, in the case \n\nof the 6\nth\n\n rib, an osteophyte developed from the interior side of the head directed \n\nto the inner thorax, in a vertical sense, giving it the aspect of a vertical bonny \n\nspike. \n\nX-Ray analysis was done over all the ribs, both in superior and inferior views, in order \n\nto detect possible conditions which where not identifiable macroscopically (for \n\nexample, lines of healed fractures). Although the results didn\u00b4t show any hidden marker \n\nwhich was not registered during the laboratorial analysis, confirmed and helped the \n\nunderstanding of the growth dynamics of the bone remodeling in the rib heads, \n\nconfirming again their direction (pointed to the interior of the thoracic cage). \n\nSome pathological conditions which presented similar markers where selected for the \n\ndifferential diagnosis, being all of them discarded because of different reasons: \n\n- Costovertebral joint osteoarthritis: the arthropaties present signs of contact \n\nbetween bone surfaces, which cause the growth of new bone tissue, but in this \n\ncase no signs of this contact was observed (such as the eburnation of any \n\nsurface), and the new bone growth in a too regular pattern which suggested that \n\nother anatomical structures could have guided it. \n\n \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

Several cases of \n\nbone remodeling can be observed in every rib head (white arrows), altering the original \n\nmorphology of the bone. \n\n- Ankylosing spondylitis: discarded because there was no presence of \n\nmorphological changes in the intervertebral surfaces (inflamated tissues, \n\nAndersson\u00b4s lesions) nor simetric syndesmophytes (calcified soft tissues, such as \n\nligaments). Also not present the tipical intervertebral fusion of the advances \n\nstages of this condition.  \n\n- Brucellar spondylitis: althought this kind of spondylitis doesn\u00b4t imply the \n\ndestruction of the intervertebral discs, the signs previously descripted for the \n\nankylosing variety where not present, what allowed to discard it. \n\n- Tuberculosis with spinal and rib involvement: discarted, since no signs of \n\nvertebral colapse, paravertebral abscess or tubercular abscess. \n\nFor understanding better the process of the bone growth, the ribs where reassembled \n\nattending to the possible connection between the flat surfaces and the few concavities \n\nand circular-shaped negatives. Was noticed that the head of the 8\nth\n\n rib fixed in the \n\noriginal articulation process of T8, but the growth of new bone in the rib head had \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

Even in this status the connection was still possible. \n\nSince all the superior vertebrae where missing, the reassemblage of the superior ribs \n\nwas done attending to their surfaces and some signs of contact beneath them. The result \n\nshowed a compression and overlap of all the ribs from 2\nnd\n\n to 7\nth\n\n over the 8\nth \n\nrib, wich \n\npossibly remained in situ, as we can see in the inferior images. The inferior ribs possibly \n\nwhere also disconected, since the new bone formation completely disfigured the \n\narticulation process of their corresponding vertebrae. \n\n \n\nProposal of reassembly of vertebrae and ribs of the individual from context 484, which displays the \n\noriginal position of the ribs during the bone alterations suffered after the trauma. \n\nThis interpretation pointed to a probable case of COSTOVERTEBRAL TRAUMA, \n\nwich implied the dislocation of the ribs of the right side of the thorax, and which started \n\na healing process without being reinserted in their original position. Since the rest of the \n\nthorax is not preserved, but the scapula from the same side doesn\u00b4t present any sign of \n\npathological condition (what could point to a vertical direction of the strenght wich \n\ncaused the trauma), we point to a possible blunt force injury from the back, wich \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

INFECTIOUS DISEASES. \n\nThe only pathology which we could determine in the case of this individual was an \n\ninfectious disease which affected absolutely all the surfaces of all the present bones \n\n(both tibia and both fibulae in the legs, and both ulna and the left radius of the \n\nforearms). All the bone surfaces presented a really irregular texture (with a wooden \n\ntexture in some parts, or covered by reactive bone in others, as well as with a recurrent \n\nporosity), and also some shape irregularities (the big size of the neck in the proximal \n\nepiphysis of the left ulna, the big section of the neck of the right tibia \u2013which we could \n\ncompare to a much more natural size in the left side- and its bulging aspect, and also the \n\nirregularities in the cylindrical shape of both the tibial diaphysis) affected the bone \n\nstructures. Also, all the bones where covered with lot of different openings (all of them \n\nwith oval or circular shapes) which go through the bone cortex. \n\nThis aspects could point to a case of SUPPURATIVE/PYOGENIC \n\nOSTEOMYELITIS, an illness which normally affects (like in this case) the long bones \n\nand which is easy to distinguish from other infectious diseases because of the presence \n\nof two distinctive markers: the INVOLUCRUM, a coarsely woven bone which \n\nsurrounds the original long bone cortex (and which normally is easy to identify thought \n\nX-Ray analysis), and the CLOACAE/FISTULAE, oval or round-shaped openings which \n\ngo thought the cortex (or even though the involucrum which could cover it) and which \n\nallow the drainage of the pus from the medullary cavity, where the bacteria originally \n\ncaused the infection. \n\nSince the presence of this characteristics are particular from this specific infectious \n\ndisease (so the differential diagnosis is clear in this case), we had to discard the \n\npossibility of that the particular morphology of the bones was a consequence of post-\n\ndepositional factors. The macroscopical analysis allowed us to identify the involucrum \n\nin all the described altered surfaces (the bones where fractured in this points, so the \n\nobservation of the sections would allow us to see the differences in the texture between \n\nthe original cortex and the new bone which surrounded it, much more woven), so we \n\ncould discard the taphonomical explanations. \n\nX-Ray analysis was also committed over all the bones in which the pathological \n\nmarkers where identified macroscopically, giving again positive results: both the \n\ncloacae and the new bone growth where identified. \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

DEGENERATIVE JOINT DISEASES. \n\nIn the case of the context 727 of Ille Cave, we could diagnose that suffered a case of \n\nOSTEOARTHRITIS, which, in this case, was located just in the vertebral column area \n\n(not possible to find signs of the disease in any other joint). Normally the disease \n\nmanifest in three peculiar aspects, which we can see below: \n\nASPECT LOCATION \n\nOsteophytes and \n\nbonny plaques \n\nSmall nodules of reactive bone where documented in the surface \n\nof several vertebrae (cervical, thoracic and lumbar areas), \n\nnormally over the superior and inferior surfaces of the vertebral \n\nbodies. \n\n \n\n*Marked in green color in the following images. \n\nMarginal lipping Located in several vertebrae, especially in the ones ascribed to the \n\nlast thoracic and the lumbar ones. The lipping is generally \n\nassociated to the edges (superior and inferior) of the vertebral \n\ndiscs, growing laterally from them as consequence of the \n\nmechanical action between the surfaces of both following bones, \n\ncaused by the lost cartilage of the joint between them. \n\n \n\n*Marked with red arrows in the following images. \n\nEburnated \n\nsurfaces \n\nIn this case we couldn\u00b4t find any case, since the taphonomical \n\nconditions (concretions all over the surface) didn\u00b4t allow us to \n\nmake a deeper analysis over the bones. \n\n   \n\n \n\nA): connected vertebrae from the cervical area. B): osteophyte over the superior vertebral body of \n\none of them (marked in a green circle).

All the cases seem to belong to \n\nthe thoracic area, but is not possible to determine the correct anatomical order, cause of the bad \n\nconservation status of the spine. \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n209 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nAnother three cases of marginal lipping (marked with red arrows) documented in the vertebral \n\nbody edges of several vertebral fragments (thoracic-lumbar area). \n\n? DENTAL DISEASES. \n\nThe first fact which called our attention over the dental pieces of this individual was the \n\nstrong level of EROSION OF THE TEETH WEAR, clearly visible in all the dental \n\npieces (missing morphology and enamel), but which affects specially to the molars, and \n\nin a higher grade to the ones of the mandibular side (inferiors). Some interesting facts \n\nabout this particular erosion kind let us to associate this wear case to some kind of \n\nactivity (maybe holding ropes or fibers with the molars?): the third molar was much \n\nmore eroded than the first and the second one in both sides (which is quite strange, since \n\nis the last dental piece in erupt), losing completely all its crowns (which still a little bit \n\nvisible in M2 and M3), and with a different siding than the other teeth (the erosion \n\nsurface sides to the front, meanwhile in M2 tends to be lateral or goes to the interior of \n\nthe mouth). Beneath all the possible explanations for this phenomenon, we have \n\nassociated this case to a POSSIBLE CONSUMPTION OF BETEL NUT, since the \n\nwear pattern is similar to other ones proceeding from archaeological register (see main \n\ntext, Chapter 4) and it has also been documented in macro-botanical register of our site. \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n210 \n \n\n \n\nThe wear pattern registered in the molars of both sides of the mandible make us thought about a \n\npossible case of abrasion, owned to some kind of human activity. In the image we can see the case of \n\nthe right molars, in occlusal, labial and lingual aspects. \n\nIs also interesting the TEETH ROOT EXPOSURE (possible case of periodontitis?), \n\ncaused by the alveolar bone recession of both maxilla and mandible. This disease is \n\nparticularly easy to verify in the case of the incisive, canines and premolars of both \n\nsides (both mandible and maxilla are quite fragmented around the molar area, so is not \n\npossible to determine if the visibility of the roots is caused because of a pathology or \n\nbecause taphonomical reasons). \n\nIt has been also documented a case of DENTAL ENAMEL HYPOPLASIA, \n\ncharacterized by the typical transverse lines and grooves on the surface of tooth crowns, \n\nclearly visible in this case in all the four canines (mandibular and maxilla) and in three \n\nof the mandibular incisives (RI1, LI1 and LI2). The strong tooth wear level and the \n\ncalcium carbonate which cover all the surfaces made impossible to analyze the rest of \n\ndental pieces in order to determine its presence in all the teeth, but microscopical \n\nanalysis was made over the seven dental pieces in order to clarify the diagnosis, with \n\npositive results. \n\nThe presence of CALCULUS (mineralized dental plaque) in almost all the dental \n\npieces (both inside and outside the mouth cavity, in a yellowish color) is also an \n\ninteresting sign of possible infections, but we couldn\u00b4t find any other sign (reactive \n\nbone, irregular or granulose surfaces, porosity, etc) which could help us to determine the \n\npresence of a clear case, once again because of taphonomical reasons. The calculus are \n\npresent in the sides of tooth crowns, both in mandible (RI1, RI2, LI1, LI2, RC, LC, \n\nRPM1, RPM2, LPM1, RM2, RM3) and maxilla (RI1, RI2, LI1, LI2, RC, LC, RPM1, \n\nLPM1, LPM2, RM2, LM1, LM2). \n\n? NON-METRIC TRAILS. \n\nFinally, was also documented a case of non-metric trails, which manifest in the maxilla \n\nin the shape of a too big mental foramen in both sides. \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

The \n\nteeth wear is quite light, since the individual is still young, as we can appreciate thought \n\nthe fact than the enamel is just starting to appear in the first molars. \n\nAt the same time, we observed that the wear pattern from the frontal teeth of the \n\nmandible (incisives, canines and premolars) was different: it didn\u00b4t affect the surfaces \n\nwith an horizontal pattern as in the molar crowns, or in the typical oblique shape that the \n\nattrition causes in this part of the mouth. Instead, the curved pattern of erosion in the \n\nlabial aspects of this teeth, suggested a case of ABRASION which remembered us the \n\ncase of the context 2247 of Ille Cave (as we can see in its pathological summary, a \n\nsimilar wear case which pointed to a POSSIBLE CASE OF USE OF THE \n\nFRONTAL TEETH AS THIRD HAND associated with some specific cases of \n\ncultural activities, like the WORK OF ANIMAL SKINS AND LEATHERS, as \n\ndeduced from cultural parallelisms with native populations still alive). Unfortunately, \n\nthe microscopical analysis in this case didn\u00b4t show us any mark (vertical sulcus, micro-\n\nfractures, chipping, etc) which allowed us to point so clearly to this kind of activities, so \n\nwe have to be cautious with this case. \n\nAlso we could notice the presence of TEETH ROOT EXPOSURE in this individual, \n\ncaused by the alveolar bone recession of both maxilla and mandible, and which \n\nappeared together with a little of REACTIVE BONE and POROSITY around all the \n\nalveolar process of both maxilla and mandible. All this facts together could point to a \n\ncase of infectious disease, more specifically to a possible case of periodontal disease. \n\nThe idea of the buccal infection gains weight if we notice also the presence of some \n\nCARIES which started to appear in the occlusal surfaces of  the mandibular molars \n\n(RM2, RM3, LM2 and LM3), even if the tissue still shows a small level of damage (just \n\nsome small pits which affect mainly to the dentine). Also CALCULUS was noticed in \n\nall the dental pieces preserved, distributed horizontally in bot labial and lingual aspects. \n\nFinally, it has been also documented a case of DENTAL ENAMEL HYPOPLASIA, \n\ncharacterized by the typical transverse lines and grooves on the surface of tooth crowns, \n\nclearly visible in this case in the RC labial aspect (mandible). The other dental pieces \n\ndoesn\u00b4t show it clearly, since are covered with the calculus and their surfaces are \n\naffected by the described wear pattern, but the microscopical analysis made over this \n\nindividual tooth makes clear the diagnosis. \n\n \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n217 \n \n\n \n\nDentition of the context 755. We can observe the labial-buccal accumulation of calculus in the \n\ndifferent teeth, the curved wear pattern of the frontal teeth (possibly because of the use of the \n\nmouth as third hand for some activities), the root exposure and the signs of infection in the alveolar \n\nbone in the mandible. Also, marked with green arrows, several caries in the mandibular molars, \n\nand in black arrows some horizontal grooves in the RMC which prove the diagnosis of DEH. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

DEGENERATIVE JOINT DISEASES. \n\nThis individual also had an interesting case of exostosis over bone surface: a small \n\nbonny plaque of new bone tissue (HYPEROSTOSIS) was formed in the right clavicle \n\nsternal end. We couldn\u00b4t determine if we are facing just new generated bone or maybe a \n\nprocess of calcification over the soft tissues of the sternoclavicular joint, but in any case \n\nboth process appear normally together in joint pathologies.  \n\nWe determined that we were facing a PROBABLE CASE OF STERNOCOSTO-\n\nCLAVICULAR HYPEROSTOSIS, a rare pathology which can appear in this area \n\nsometimes, and in which both new bone growth and ossification of articular soft tissues \n\nare present. We based our differential diagnosis in two other similar pathologies which \n\ncan manifest in the same area and with similar markers: \n\n? Osteochondroma/osseocartilaginous exostosis: a kind of benign tumor that is \n\nreally rare in clavicles. Is associated with a differential growth of the medial \n\nclavicle, which we can\u00b4t determine here (missing) and with the presence of \n\nreactive bone around the clavicle\u00b4s epiphysis (not just in the joint surface itself), \n\nwhich we didn\u00b4t record in this case. \n\n? Aseptic osteonecrosis, different arthropaties, etc: the also present erosion and/or \n\ndegeneration process aver the joint surfaces, process which didn\u00b4t appear in our \n\ncase. \n\n \n\nAnterior and lateral views of the right clavicle sternal end of our individual, in which we can \n\nappreciate the growing of new bone (exostosis), right in the center of the sternal articulation \n\n(whitish coloring). \n\n \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n219 \n \n\n? DENTAL DISEASES. \n\nNo dental diseases where documented in this case because of the poor conservation \n\nstatus of the bones (concretions all over the surfaces and almost all the maxilla is \n\ndisintegrated, plus the middle part of the mandible is missing). About the TEETH \n\nWEAR of this individual, we could observe that the erosion of the dental pieces \n\naffected lightly just some surfaces, always occlusal, which could be a consequence of \n\nthe natural ATRITION.  \n\n \n\nDentition of the context 800. As we can see, the attrition caused a horizontal wear pattern over the \n\nocclusal surfaces of the molars. We didn\u00b4t record any wear pattern which could point to any kind of \n\ndietary information or activity reason. No other pathologies documented. \n\n? METABOLIC DISEASES. \n\nAlso, the skeleton from the context 800 of Ille Cave presented a concentration of \n\nporosity in the right supraorbital ridge (the left one is not present). We immediately \n\ndetermined that should be a pathological sign, since the porosity appeared located in a \n\nconcentrated shadow in the orbit roof, while the rest of the bone surface had no any \n\nother kind of marks. We determined a case of CRIBRA ORBITALIA, since this kind \n\nof porosity accumulations around the orbital roof are a characteristic landmark of this \n\npathology. \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

DENTAL DISEASES. \n\nThe first fact we tried to analyze in the dental pieces which we could ascribe to this \n\nindividual (the context included extra dental pieces, and the conservation status of both \n\nmandible and maxilla didn\u00b4t allow us to determine in some cases which one of the \n\npossible options was actually part of the individual, so we decided to base our study in \n\nthe few one which surely where part of it) was the TEETH WEAR. The occlusal \n\nsurfaces of the teeth showed an advances level of erosion, which showed concavities in \n\nthe crowns of the molars. We assumed that was a consequence of an intense \n\nATTRITION case, which normally develops these concavities in the occlusal surfaces \n\n(when the wear arrives to the dentine, which degenerates faster than the enamel). Since \n\nno signs of activity patterns where founded, we can\u00b4t speak about any kind of activity \n\nsigns, but is possible that the wear process was stronger and faster cause dietary reasons \n\n(abrasive food?). In any case, since almost all the dental pieces are missing, once again \n\nwe should be cautious about these ideas. \n\nAnother feature that we could observe in this individual was an advanced level of \n\nTEETH ROOT EXPOSURE, with a strong recession of the alveolar bone, which also \n\nseemed to show signs of a possible infection (POROSITY and CALCULUS). All this \n\ncould be signs of a possible periodontitis, but in any case would be quite light compared \n\nto the one documented in other individuals of Ille Cave (the calculus is really light and \n\naffects just to some pieces, the alveolar process presents a lighter porosity, etc). Again, \n\nsince almost all the dental pieces are missing, we can\u00b4t determine more than the fact of \n\nthat this signs are markers of a possible infection, but we can\u00b4t go deeper in our \n\nanalysis. \n\n. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

We can observe the occlusal wear pattern and the root exposure. \n\nUnfortunately, the conservation status (several missing pieces) ant the concretions of carbonate \n\nwhich cover all the surfaces, made impossible a deeper analysis in this case of study. Even like that, \n\nwe were able to determine the presence of a thin calculus accumulation in the labial side of the \n\nteeth, and also some porosity in the preserved alveolar surfaces which could point to a possible \n\nbuccal infection. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

DENTAL DISEASES. \n\nAbout the TEETH WEAR patterns of the individual 1337 from Ille Cave, we can just \n\nsay here that we didn\u2019t notice the presence of any kind of abrasive material between the \n\nteeth (no marks of activity, nor dietary elements, which could break with the normal \n\nATTRITION between opposite teeth, which is clearly resent here with the natural \n\nocclusal pattern: flat surfaces in molars and oblique ones in the frontal teeth).  \n\nWe noticed again the presence of the TEETH ROOT EXPOSURE in this individual, \n\ncaused by the alveolar bone recession of both maxilla and mandible, and which \n\nappeared together with a light case of alveolar infection, manifest thought the presence \n\nof REACTIVE BONE and POROSITY around all the alveolar process of both mandible \n\nand maxilla. All this facts together could point to a possible case of infectious disease, \n\nas also does the presence of CALCULUS deposits, which where noticed in all the \n\ndental pieces preserved, distributed horizontally in bot labial and lingual aspects. The \n\ncalculus accumulated in the dental pieces of this individual is the most significate of all \n\nwhich we registered in our study of Ille Cave: specially in the buccal side of the \n\nmandibular incisives, the deposits of mineralized dental plaque where so big that they \n\neven made contact beneath them, giving an uniform appearance of the surface. \n\nAnother interesting fact that we could register in this individual is a complete process of \n\nALVEOLAR RIDGE RESORPTION in the surface of the maxilla, where previously \n\nwould have been the RM3, so we can determine that the individual lost this dental piece \n\nduring his life time (ante mortem). \n\n \n\nDetail of the maxilla of the individual 1337 (buccal view) in which we can observe the resorption of \n\nthe alveolar ridge around the lost RM3 (red circle). \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

DENTAL DISEASES. \n\nBetween the dental diseases of this individual, we just could determine an advanced \n\nlevel of TEETH WEAR which affected de frontal dental pieces of both mandible and \n\nmaxilla in an oblique buccal pattern, and the molars in a horizontal pattern over the \n\nocclusal surface. Since no marks of any kind where documented during the microscopic \n\nanalysis, we assume that was just a consequence of the natural ATTRITION. \n\nAlso, called our attention the advanced level of TEETH ROOT EXPOSURE, with the \n\nrecession of the alveolar bone, in both mandible and maxillary surfaces. Unfortunately, \n\nthe big accumulations of carbonate concretions (taphonomy) all over the surfaces of \n\nboth teeth and alveolar surfaces made impossible to determine any other condition \n\n(calculus, abscess, reactive bone, enamel hypoplasia, etc), so we couldn\u00b4t point to any \n\nspecific disease. \n\n \n\nDentition of the context 1825. We can observe the root exposure, especially in the upper frontal \n\nteeth and in the sequence RPM2-M3 of the mandible.

TRAUMA. \n\nThe individual also presented a healed fracture of the left femur: on the midshaft of the \n\nbone we can observe a case of oblique/transverse fracture, healed but misaligned, which \n\nwould have clearly affected to the mobility of the individual for the rest of his life time.  \n\nEven if unfortunately the fractured area was affected with an orthogonal modern \n\nfracture, this event allowed us to analyze the section of the bone in the area, getting \n\ninteresting information: we could see, in fact, that the fracture was oblique and that it \n\ndidn\u2019t repair in its original aligned position, but in a lateral superposition between both \n\nfragments, since both medullary cavities appear in a parallel position in the visible \n\nsection.  \n\nWe couldn\u00b4t determine the presence of a callus, what together with the formation of \n\nlamellar/woven bone, which is already being replaced in some areas with trabecular \n\nbone, make us thought that the process of fracture repair was in the latter possible phase \n\n(remodeling stage). \n\nOf course X-Ray analysis was also used over this case, what allowed us to confirm the \n\ntype of fracture and see more clearly the process of misaligned healing in this case of \n\ntraumatism, as we can observe in the following pictures. \n\n \n\nView of the section (contemporary fracture) of the healed oblique fracture present on the medial \n\nleft femur of our individual, in which we can appreciate two parallel medullary cavities, as the \n\nresult of the non-aligned repair of the traumatism. \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

DEGENERATIVE JOINT DISEASES. \n\nIn the case of the context 2247 of Ille Cave, we could diagnose that suffered a case of \n\nOSTEOARTHRITIS, which, in this case, was located just in the vertebral column. As \n\nwe can see below, two of the three typical markers of this pathology are present in \n\nseveral vertebrae: \n\nASPECT LOCATION \n\nOsteophytes and \n\nbonny plaques \n\nSmall nodules of reactive bone where documented in the surface \n\nof several vertebrae, over the superior and inferior surfaces of the \n\nvertebral bodies: C3-4, T10-12 and L3. \n\n \n\n*Marked in green color in the following images. \n\nMarginal lipping Located in several vertebrae: C3-4, T4-12 and L1-5. The lipping \n\nis generally associated to the edges (superior and inferior) of the \n\nvertebral discs, growing laterally from them as consequence of \n\nthe mechanical action between the surfaces of both following \n\nbones, caused by the lost cartilage of the joint between them. \n\n \n\n*Marked with red arrows in the following images. \n\nEburnated \n\nsurfaces \n\nWe couldn\u00b4t determine the presence of any eburnated surface in \n\n2247 vertebrae, but the presence of both the previous markers \n\nseems enough for the diagnosis. \n\n  \n\nAlso was possible to identify several SCHMORL\u00b4S NODES in all the vertebrae of the \n\nlumbar area (L1-5), located in all the cases in the central vertebral body superior and \n\ninferior surfaces, and which appear as small pits or depressions over the bone surface \n\n(caused by the inflammation and protrusion of the cartilage of the intervertebral disc \n\nthought the vertebral body endplate and into the adjacent vertebrae). Even if Schmorl\u00b4s \n\nnodes can be linked also the osteoarthritis in some cases (can be part of its \n\nsymptomatology), is not necessary that this occurs, so we registered both cases as \n\ndifferent paleopathological evidences. We can observe them also in the attached \n\nphotography (next page, marked in yellow). \n\n? TRAUMA. \n\nWe also registered a case of a HEALED NASAL FRACTURE in this individual, \n\nwhich we could determine by the presence of an horizontal groove which crossed the \n\nright nasal bone (fracture line), the irregularities in the articulation with the opposite \n\nnasal and the right maxilla (the nasal fragmented piece healed in a different position to \n\nthe original one) and also because of the presence of a deviation in the vomer bone (the \n\ndeviation of the nasal septum is normally present in this cases of nasal trauma).  \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

As we can see in the mandible \n\nmolars and first premolars, the horizontal wear has already arrived to the point \n\nof transforming the original shape of the dental pieces: the crowns have already \n\ndisappeared, and the dentine starts to appear beneath the enamel loss. This kind \n\nof horizontal occlusal pattern corresponds to the natural ATTRITION: the wear \n\nof the dental pieces because of their friction with the opposite ones during the \n\nmasticatory process. \n\n? Instead, the frontal teeth of this individual present a different scenario in the \n\nmandible: all the mandibular incisives and the first premolars have an oblique \n\npattern of wear, as normally happens because of the attrition. But, in this case, \n\nthe surface appears curved in the labial aspect (macroscopically, is easy to \n\nobserve this rounded shape of the enamel in the premolar area), what suggest a \n\nnon-natural factor of erosion: this particular shape could be the result of the \n\nABRASION, so the involvement in the process of a third element between both \n\nteeth files (abrasive element on the diet, object, etc). Comparing this case with \n\nethnographical studies made over other contemporaneous native populations \n\n(Ex: Inuit, Australian aborigines, etc), we noticed that this wear pattern is \n\nnormally associated with the development of some specific cultural practices or \n\neconomic activities. We could determine the presence of a POSSIBLE CASE \n\nOF USE OF THE FRONTAL TEETH AS THIRD HAND. The analysis of \n\nthe mandibular frontal teeth in the microscope also gave us some interesting \n\nclues: we could register a microrotures of the enamel of LI2, which goes over all \n\nthe labial aspect of the tooth, from the occlusal edge to the root, in a vertical \n\ndisposition which normally is related to a vertical strength made over these teeth \n\nline, from up to down. Again, the ethnographical comparative allowed us to give \n\na possible explanation: the WORK OF ANIMAL SKINS AND LEATHERS \n\ncauses the same wear pattern in the Inuit, with the presence of the same shape \n\nand the same kind of microrotures, as a result of the vertical strength made over \n\nthe animal skin, pulling down of it while holding it with the teeth. \n\nAlso we could notice the presence of TEETH ROOT EXPOSURE in this individual, \n\ncaused by the alveolar bone recession of both maxilla and mandible, and which \n\nappeared together with a little of REACTIVE BONE and POROSITY around all the \n\nalveolar process of both maxilla and mandible. All this facts together could point to a \n\npossible case of infectious disease, more specifically to a possible case of periodontal \n\ndisease. \n\nThe idea of the buccal infection gains weight if we notice also the presence of some \n\nCARIES which appeared in the mandibular molars (in LM1 inter-dental aspect with  \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

We can observe the accumulation of calculus in the different teeth, \n\nthe curved wear pattern of the frontal teeth, the root exposure and the signs of infection in the \n\nalveolar bone and the caries in the three molars of the right side of the mandible. \n\n \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

Also CALCULUS was noticed in all the dental \n\npieces preserved, distributed horizontally in bot labial and lingual aspects. \n\nFinally, it has been also registered a case of DENTAL ENAMEL HYPOPLASIA, \n\ncharacterized by the typical transverse lines and grooves on the surface of tooth crowns, \n\nclearly visible in this case both macroscopically and under the microscope in maxillary \n\nfirst incisives of both sides (RI1 and LI1) and in the LC of the mandible.  \n\n \n\nDetail picture of the frontal dentition of the context 2247, in which we can appreciate the curved \n\ndental wear pattern in the labial aspect of the teeth (especially in the canines and premolars), and \n\nalso the vertical microrotures in LI2 (red box). Is also possible to notice the enamel hypoplasia over \n\nthe surface of LC. \n\n \n\n \n\nResults of the microscopical analysis made over several maxillary dental pieces of the skeleton in \n\nthe context 2247, in which we can appreciate the typical transverse lines of DEH.

INFECTIOUS DISEASES. \n\nAbout the infectious diseases, is really interesting the case of the pathology registered in \n\nboth limbs of this individual: the epiphysis of both legs (both femurs and tibiae) and \n\narms (both humerus, left ulna and right radius) where covered with several areas in wich \n\nthe original cortical surfaces where covered with an extra layer of new bone formations, \n\nnormally in the shape of small plaques and fine pitting, giveing the bone a woven \n\nporous aspect. The disposition of this new bone tissue in longitudinal striations allowed \n\nus to determine a case of PERIOSTITIS in both arms and legs: the differential \n\ndiagnosis is inmediate with other cases of infrectious diseases, because this particular \n\norganization of the new bone in paralel striae is typical and definitory of the periostitis. \n\nAlso, some small osteophyte was doccumented in the distal left fibula (marked in a \n\ncircle in the next photography), another characteristic wich normally comes associated \n\nwith the periostitis. \n\nIs interesting that the distribution of this new bone formations affects specially to the \n\ndown limbs, and even more in the case of the tibia, another clue for the diagnosis, since \n\nnormally this kind of infectious disease manifest stronger in the tibial diaphysis. The \n\norigin of the disease comes normally from the formation of microtraumatisms wich \n\nappear in the periostium of the long bones in the legs, caused by locomotor intense \n\nactivities (for example, intense running: the vibrations caused for the constant impact of \n\nthe limbs in the floor causes the microrotures). This microrotures will be the focus from \n\nwhere the infection will expand a posteriori. \n\n \n\nNew bone formation over the distal-medial surfaces of both left (A) and right fibulae (B), marker of \n\nthe registered case of periostitis. \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n247 \n \n\n? NON-SPECIFIC DISEASES. \n\nFinally, another pathology was registered in the pelvic gridle: the surface of the pubic \n\nsimpysis of the right side presents several pits and irregularities, together with shape \n\nloss, what seems to be caused by a degenerative process. Also, the growth of new bone \n\ntissue contributed to the current alterated aspect of the bone. \n\nSeveral options where take in account for the fdifferential diagnosis: \n\n? Osteitis. \n\n? Arthropaties. \n\n? Non specific infectious disease (part of the generalized case wich we shown \n\nbefore). \n\n? Trauma (Ex: pubic bone stress fracture) wich could cause a posterior infection. \n\nAfter discarting the presence of any significative fracture, we opted for diagnose a \n\nPOSSIBLE PUBLIC OSTEITIS, since is a pathology wich can appear as the result of \n\ninfectious process (but not in every case: that\u00b4s why we decided to catalogue this case as \n\na non-specific disease). Is normally frecuent in sportive people, specially in cases of \n\npeople wich makes a lot of exercise with the down limbs (what would fit well with the \n\nprevious case of periostitis wich we analyzed), an normaly with intense changes of \n\nrhythm (abrupt acceleration/deceleration, climbing activities, kick movements, etc). \n\nThis high intensity of the activity makes the pubic are suffer quite big stress situations: \n\nthe strong abdominal efforts can create microtraumatisms, wich would be the focus of \n\nthe inmediate infection. But also the ilness can be originated after the introduction of \n\nbacteries in the organism, arround the abdominal area, so the activity explanation ins \n\nnot definitive in any case. \n\nIn advances states of the pubic osteitis, the loss over the pubic simphysis outline is quite \n\nevident, like in our case of study, and also the symptoms can extend to the sacroiliac \n\njoint (in our case we could register reactive bone and marginal lipping in the same side \n\njoint, so the differential diagnosis worked, and even in the opposite side joint). \n\nIs really unfortunate the fact than the other pubic simphysis is missing, cause normally \n\nthis pathology is symetric (manifest in both sides of the body, as we could deduct from \n\nthe fact that both sacroiliac joints present lipping and new bone growth). The same thing \n\nhappens for the attachment area of the gracillis ligament, wich is also missing in this \n\ncase, since is another area in wich the pubic osteitis manifest in advances states. This \n\nmissing informations make us to avoid a definitive diagnosis, so we can just say that the \n\npubic osteitis is probably related to the markers that we can observe in the pelvic gridle \n\nof this individual. \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.

In the images, we can observe two perspectives of \n\nthe marginal lipping in the right (A) and the left (B) sacroiliac joints. \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo P\u00e9rez Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n \n \n\n249 \n \n\n? PHYSICAL STRESS MARKERS. \n\nFinally, some signs of new bone groth where registered in the shoulder area of the \n\nskeleton: \n\n- Clavicles: new bone accumulation over the ligament insertion areas (conoid and \n\ncostoclavicular ligaments), and also arround the attachment of the deloid \n\nmuscle. \n\n- Scapulae: bilateral signs of new bone formation and small osteophytes over the \n\nacromion process of both scapulae.  \n\n \n\nFor the differential diagnosis, two scenarios where present: \n\n- Some kind of infection in the muscles and ligaments of the shoulder articulation. \n\n- The alterations on the bone (new bone growth) as a response to an activity stress \n\nsuffered in the area. \n\n \n\nWe pointed to a case of OCUPATIONAL STRESS MARKERS IN BOTH \n\nSHOULDER ARTICULATIONS, since the bone was growing in the ligament and \n\nmuscular insertions of the clavicles and the articulation of them with both scapulae. \n\nSimilar lesions have been identified in the literature with rowers or people wich \n\nsupported considerable levels of stress in their shoulders (carring, lifting and padding \n\nactivities). In this cases the hyperdevelopement of the muscles wich participate in the \n\njoint circular movement provoques the new bone formation at entheses and \n\nsyndesmoses, as in this particular case, in order to stabilize the attachment. \n\n \n\nNew bone formation over the acromion process of both right (A) and left (B) scapulae in our \n\nindividual. \n\n \n\n\n\nPALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.
