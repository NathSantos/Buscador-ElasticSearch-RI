The association of active faults to this kind of \nhigh magnitude event has been extensively studied specially due to the \ncontribution of several international projects for more than two decades. \nHowever, the meaning of the persistent small to intermediate magnitude \nseismicity recognized in this region is still particularly not fully understood. This \nis, at least, related to the lack of an accurate hypocenter location of these \nevents resulting from an asymmetrical geographical distribution of the \npermanent seismic network. \n\nOne of the main purposes of the NEAREST project (Integrated observation from \nNEAR shore sourcES of Tsunamis: towards an early warning system GOCE, \ncontract n. 037110) was the identification and characterization of seismogenic \nand tsunamigenic structures in the Gulf of Cadiz area, source region of the \nLisbon 1755 earthquake and tsunami. To address this problem 24 broadband \nOcean Bottom Seismometers (OBS) and a seafloor multiparametric station \nGEOSTAR (Geophysical and Oceanographic Station for Abyssal Research) \nacquired between August 2007 and July 2008 passive seismic data in this \nregion. The results delivered a detailed record of the local seismicity, revealing \n3 main clusters of earthquakes, two of them coinciding with the location of the 3 \nlarger instrumental earthquakes in the area: i) the 28th February 1969 \n(Mw~8.0); ii) the 12th February 2007 (Mw=6.0) and iii) the 17th December 2009 \n(Mw=5.5). Focal mechanisms show a mixed pattern, mostly strike-slip and \nreverse dip-slip with a very few normal mechanisms. The results show that  of \nthe recorded events are located in the mantle (at depths between 30 and 60 \nkm). This implies the existence of tectonically active structures located much \ndeeper than the ones mapped by Multichannel seismic reflection. \n\nA thorough analysis shows that the seismicity clusters are offset with respect to \nthe upper crustal active thrusts. The wide-range solutions of focal mechanisms \nalso imply that the related source processes are complex. This can reflect the \ninteraction of different active geological features, such as faults and rheological \nboundaries. To understand these new results in the context of the seismo-\ntectonics of the Gulf of Cadiz a review of some available geophysical data \n(reflection and refraction seismic profiles interpretation) in this area is presented \nas well as novel work on seismic reflection profile IAM GB1 across a rheologic \nboundary and seismicity cluster.  \n\nOur study shows that the seismicity clusters are located at faults intersections \nmapped at the seafloor and shallow crust, suggesting that the crustal tectonic \nfaults are replicated in the lithospheric mantle. These fault interferences are \n\n\n\n \n\nII \n \n\nassociated with boundaries of lithospheric domains prone to localize stress and \nseismic strain. \n\nActive crustal faults are either locked or move through slow aseismic slip. \nFrictional slip in crustal faults is probably limited to high magnitude earthquakes. \nSerpentinization probably induces tectonic decoupling limiting micro-seismicity \nto depths below the serpentinized layer. It is expected that during high-\nmagnitude events seismic rupture is favored by weakening mechanisms and \npropagates upwards through the serpentinized layer up to the surface. \n\nThe results obtained in this work improve our knowledge about the local \nseismicity and related active faults in the Gulf of Cadiz area, giving a new \ncontribution to access to the seismic hazard in the Nubia-Iberia plate boundary \nin the Northeast Atlantic Region. \n\nKeywords: Nubia-Iberia plate boundary; micro-seismicity; serpentinization; \nstrain partitioning; high-magnitude earthquakes \n  \n\n\n\n \n\nIII \n \n\nResumo  \n\nO Golfo de C\u00e1dis \u00e9 uma regi\u00e3o com uma sismicidade moderada embora se \nconhe\u00e7a, tanto no registo hist\u00f3rico como instrumental, eventos de elevada \nmagnitude. O sismo de 1 de Novembro de 1755 \u00e9 um exemplo paradigm\u00e1tico \ncom uma magnitude estimada de 8.8 e um tsunami associado com Mt = 8.5. \n\nJ\u00e1 o sismo de 28 de Fevereiro de 1969, \u00e9 o mais importante registado \ninstrumentalmente, teve uma Ms de 7.9, ao qual esteve associado um pequeno \ntsunami. Mais recentemente, salientam-se os sismos de 12 de Fevereiro de \n2007, com Mw=6.0 e o de 17 de Dezembro de 2009, com Mw =5.5 (EMSC-\nEuropean-Mediterranean Seismological Centre). No entanto, a sismicidade \nnesta regi\u00e3o \u00e9 descrita como de magnitude baixa a interm\u00e9dia, com uma \ndistribui\u00e7\u00e3o em profundidade acima dos 60 km. \n\nCorrelacionar esta sismicidade com potenciais estruturas sismog\u00e9nicas no \nGolfo de C\u00e1dis constituiu um dos objectivos do projecto NEAREST (Integrated \nobservation from NEAR shore sourcES of Tsunamis: towards an early warning \nsystem GOCE, contract n. 037110). Neste contexto, foram necess\u00e1rias uma \ncaracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o e localiza\u00e7\u00e3o mais precisas dos eventos s\u00edsmicos ocorridos \nnesta regi\u00e3o, at\u00e9 agora limitadas pelos constrangimentos inerentes \u00e0 \ndistribui\u00e7\u00e3o geogr\u00e1fica das esta\u00e7\u00f5es permanentes terrestres. Por isso, foi \ndesenvolvida uma campanha de aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o de dados cont\u00ednuos utilizando uma \nrede de sism\u00f3metros de fundo do mar. \n\nA rede s\u00edsmica NEAREST operou de modo cont\u00ednuo num per\u00edodo de 11 \nmeses, entre Agosto de 2007 Julho de 2008, integrando 24 sism\u00f3metros de \nfundo do mar (OBS) e uma esta\u00e7\u00e3o multiparam\u00e9trica- GEOSTAR. Durante as \ncampanhas de coloca\u00e7\u00e3o e recupera\u00e7\u00e3o dos instrumentos, as manipula\u00e7\u00f5es \ndos OBS e GEOSTAR estiveram a cargo do Alfred Wegener Institute for \nPolarand Marine Research e do Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia \u2013\nINGV, respectivamente. \n\nOs OBS foram constru\u00eddos pela K.U.M. Umwelt- und Meerestechnik Kiel \nGmbH, Germany e incorporavam sism\u00f3metros de banda larga G\u00fcralp CMG-\n40T e um hidrofone. A GEOSTAR \u00e9 um observat\u00f3rio que integra diversos \nequipamentos para a recolha de dados geof\u00edsicos e oceanogr\u00e1ficos em \ncont\u00ednuo. Nesta esta\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e3o inclu\u00eddos um sism\u00f3metro de banda larga com 3 \ncomponentes e um hidrofone usados nesta campanha. \n\nAs esta\u00e7\u00f5es terrestres est\u00e3o a cargo do Instituto Portugu\u00eas do Mar e da \nAtmosfera (IPMA) e Instituto Dom Luiz (IDL) correspondendo a sism\u00f3metros de \nbanda larga tamb\u00e9m com 3 componentes. Os registos nestas esta\u00e7\u00f5es foram \napenas utilizados para constranger as solu\u00e7\u00f5es dos mecanismos focais. Em \ntrabalhos futuros, prev\u00ea-se a sua inclus\u00e3o na localiza\u00e7\u00e3o dos eventos \nidentificados pela rede NEAREST. Durante o per\u00edodo de aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o foram \n\n\n\n \n\nIV \n \n\nregistados na rede terrestre, para a \u00e1rea delimitada pela rede NEAREST, cerca \nde 270 sismos locais. \n\nDurante o per\u00edodo de funcionamento da rede NEAREST foram identificados \ncerca de 750 eventos observados em mais de 3 esta\u00e7\u00f5es. Deste total 590 \nsismos estavam localizados na \u00e1rea da rede NEAREST. A localiza\u00e7\u00e3o \nhipocentral foi testada usando diferentes metodologias e modelos de \nvelocidades: a) invers\u00e3o conjunta das posi\u00e7\u00f5es hipocentrais e correc\u00e7\u00f5es de \nesta\u00e7\u00f5es; b) o m\u00e9todo das diferen\u00e7as duplas e c) a invers\u00e3o conjunta do \nmodelo de velocidades-localiza\u00e7\u00f5es hipocentrais e correc\u00e7\u00f5es de esta\u00e7\u00f5es. \n\nO cat\u00e1logo final inclui 443 eventos identificados em mais de 6 esta\u00e7\u00f5es e \nlocalizados na \u00e1rea da rede NEAREST. De um modo geral, a maioria dos \nhipocentros est\u00e3o localizados a mais de 30 km de profundidade, portanto no \nmanto. As magnitudes locais variam entre 1.2 e 4.8.  \n\nAs localiza\u00e7\u00f5es epicentrais e hipocentrais baseadas na rede NEAREST \ndivergem das solu\u00e7\u00f5es conhecidas para a rede terrestre (providenciadas pelo \nIPMA), estando deslocadas para SW e sendo mais profundas. A diferen\u00e7a de \nprofundidade pode atingir os 40 km. A campanha do projecto NEAREST \npermitiu a identifica\u00e7\u00e3o de uma grande quantidade de eventos n\u00e3o detectada \npela rede terrestre. \n\nEsta campanha permitiu ainda uma redefini\u00e7\u00e3o da distribui\u00e7\u00e3o da sismicidade \nna regi\u00e3o, at\u00e9 ent\u00e3o considerada difusa. Destes resultados foi poss\u00edvel \nreconhecer 3 enxames de sismicidade, dois destes coincidentes com 3 dos \nmaiores eventos observados no registo instrumental. Tanto os sismos de 28 de \nFevereiro de 1969 (Mw~8.0) como 12 de Fevereiro de 2007 (Mw=6.0) na \nproximidade da Falha da Ferradura e 17 de Dezembro de 2009 (ML=6.0) na \nregi\u00e3o do canh\u00e3o de S\u00e3o de Vicente. Os mecanismos focais do cat\u00e1logo \nNEAREST s\u00e3o consistentes com estes eventos bem como com solu\u00e7\u00f5es de \ntensores de momento publicadas para esta regi\u00e3o. \n\nNo enxame do canh\u00e3o de S\u00e3o Vicente \u00e9 onde est\u00e3o localizados a maioria dos \neventos. Os hipocentros encontram-se a profundidades entre os 20 e os 55 km. \nA distribui\u00e7\u00e3o dos epicentros apresenta um alinhamento ? NE-SW ao longo do \ncanh\u00e3o de S\u00e3o Vicente e prolongando-se para o limite NE da Falha da \nFerradura. Os mecanismos focais dominantes s\u00e3o de desligamento e obl\u00edquos, \ncombinando movimento de desligamento com uma menor contribui\u00e7\u00e3o de \nmovimento inverso. Foram ainda registados raros eventos em falha normal. A \ncompress\u00e3o m\u00e1xima \u00e9 aproximadamente sub-paralela ao SHmax, com uma \ndirec\u00e7\u00e3o ?NW-SE.  \n\nOs epicentros localizados no enxame a SW da Falha da Ferradura, tem um \nalinhamento aproximadamente NW-SE, sub-paralelo \u00e0 direc\u00e7\u00e3o de SHmax \nregional. Neste enxame os hipocentros s\u00e3o mais profundos localizando-se \nentre os 30 e os 55km. Os mecanismos focais s\u00e3o na sua maioria de \n\n\n\n \n\nV \n \n\ndesligamento puro existindo alguns eventos em falha inversa e tamb\u00e9m raras \nsolu\u00e7\u00f5es em falha normal. Importa salientar que as solu\u00e7\u00f5es de desligamento \napresentam frequentemente um plano subparalelo \u00e0 orienta\u00e7\u00e3o das falhas de \ndesligamento SWIM (?WNW-ESE a E-W). A compress\u00e3o m\u00e1xima \u00e9 \naproximadamente NW-SE e NNW-SSE, a W e E do enxame de sismicidade, \nrespectivamente. As direc\u00e7\u00f5es de SHmax s\u00e3o mais uma vez coincidentes com \na dire\u00e7\u00e3o de compress\u00e3o m\u00e1xima.  \n\nNo enxame do Banco do Gorringe maioria dos sismos est\u00e3o localizados no \nbordo SW deste relevo submarino, sub-paralelos \u00e0 falha do Gorringe. Os \neventos s\u00e3o menos profundos quando comparados com os outros dois \nenxames, na sua maioria acima dos 40 km. Os mecanismos focais s\u00e3o na sua \nmaioria de desligamento e em falha inversa. Tamb\u00e9m neste enxame foram \nregistados alguns sismos em falha normal. A direc\u00e7\u00e3o de compress\u00e3o m\u00e1xima \ne o SHmax s\u00e3o NNW-SSE.  \n\nO facto de estes eventos se localizarem predominantemente no manto constitui \num dos principais resultados deste trabalho. Neste contexto, tendo em \nconsidera\u00e7\u00e3o a profundidade dos eventos s\u00edsmicos, a correla\u00e7\u00e3o da \nsismicidade com as estruturas sismog\u00e9nicas na regi\u00e3o do Golfo de C\u00e1dis \u00e9 \nparticularmente complexa. Esta compara\u00e7\u00e3o foi desenvolvida com base nos \ndados de s\u00edsmica de reflex\u00e3o e refra\u00e7\u00e3o dispon\u00edveis. \n\nDo nosso estudo resulta que a sismicidade parece estar concentrada em zonas \nde interfer\u00eancia de falhas localizadas no manto subcrustal litosf\u00e9rico. Estas \ndever\u00e3o ser uma replica\u00e7\u00e3o do padr\u00e3o observado a n\u00edveis crustais e parecem \nser coincidentes com transi\u00e7\u00f5es entre diferentes dom\u00ednios litosf\u00e9ricos. Estas \nzonas de interfer\u00eancia de falhas dever\u00e3o ser \u00e1reas favor\u00e1veis \u00e0 acumula\u00e7\u00e3o de \ntens\u00f5es e deforma\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00edsmica. \n\nAs falhas activas crustais dever\u00e3o estar ou bloqueadas ou movimentar-se de \nmodo ass\u00edsmico. A movimenta\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00edsmica pode estar associada apenas a \nsismos de maior magnitude. A exist\u00eancia de n\u00edveis serpentinizados no Golfo de \nC\u00e1dis \u00e9 suportada por dados de s\u00edsmica refrac\u00e7\u00e3o e furos de sondagens \nprofundas. Estes podem funcionar como planos de descolamento para as \ngrandes falhas inversas, acomodando a movimenta\u00e7\u00e3o as\u00edsmica e impedindo a \nmicro-sismicidade de se propagar aos n\u00edveis crustais. Durante os sismos de \nelevada magnitude estes n\u00edveis serpentinizados dever\u00e3o funcionar como zona \nenfraquecida, de baixo atrito, favorecendo a propaga\u00e7\u00e3o da ruptura s\u00edsmica at\u00e9 \n\u00e0 superf\u00edcie. \n\nOs resultados obtidos neste trabalho melhoram o nosso conhecimento sobre a \nsismicidade e a sua rela\u00e7\u00e3o com as falhas activas na regi\u00e3o do limite de placas \nlitosf\u00e9ricas no Golfo de C\u00e1dis, contribuindo para o estudo do risco s\u00edsmico  \nassociada a sismos devastadores. \n\n\n\n \n\nVI \n \n\nPalavras-chave: fronteira de placas N\u00fabia-Ib\u00e9ria; micro-sismicidade; \nserpentiniza\u00e7\u00e3o; parti\u00e7\u00e3o da deforma\u00e7\u00e3o; s\u00edsmos de elevada magnitude  \n\n\n\n \n\nVII \n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nThe work presented here was not possible without the support of many people \nto whom I would like to thank. \n\nI start to acknowledge the support of my supervisors, Pedro Terrinha and Luis \nMatias: for suggesting the thesis topic, help me pursue my goals and reviewing \nthis manuscript.  \n\nTo Wolfram Geissler by having received me in the Alfred Wegener Institute \nHelmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research for processing of the \nNEAREST OBS data (as part of the FCT and the Deutscher Akademischer \nAustauschdienst (DAAD) Agreement for Cooperation in Science for Portuguese \nand German research teams). \nTo Nevio Zitellini for including me in the NEAREST project as well as the \ncollaboration and discussion on the thesis topic. \n\nTo Cesar Ranero, for the participation in the MCS reflection campaign in the \nGulf of Cadiz and Alboran, as part of the TOPOMED (ESF-EUROCORE \nProgramme) project.

Introduction \n \n\n1 \n \n\nI.Introduction  \n\nThe seismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz region has been classified as diffuse with \nrespect to the distribution of the epicentres and intermediate in what respects \nfrequency and magnitude of the events, although occasionally the area is \nstricken by strong and mega-earthquakes. Examples of these are, i) the 1st \nNovember of 1755 earthquake which had estimated magnitude of 8.8 (Richter, \n1958 and Johnston, 1996) that generated a large tsunami on the coast of \nPortugal, SW Spain and NW Morocco and ii) the instrumentally recorded 28th \nFebruary 1969 earthquake that had a surface magnitude (Ms) of 7.9 (Fukao, \n1973) and a small tsunami associated with.  \n\nIn the last decades, research focussed on the mapping of seismogenic and \ntsunamigenic sources in this area through acquisition of swath bathymetry, \nmulti-seismic reflection, wide-angle and refraction seismic surveys, analogue \nand numerical modelling. A remarkable improvement on the understanding of \nthe tectonic activity resulted from the processing and interpretation of these \ndata. However, there is still an unclear relation between the seismicity and the \nactive faults identified. The accurate location of seismicity is hampered by the \nfact that the onshore seismic stations network is positioned around a semi-circle \nacross south Portugal, southwest Spain and northwest Morocco. As a result \nearthquakes locations are poorly constrained, particularly for low to intermediate \nmagnitude events. \n\nOne of the main goals of the NEAREST project was the characterization of \npotential seismogenic and tsunamigenic sources located near shore in the Gulf \nof Cadiz area was. To ensure accurate seismicity identification, 24 ocean \nbottom seismometers (LOBSTER- Longterm Ocean Bottom Seismometer for \nTsunami and Earthquake Research) and a multiparametric station \u2013 GEOSTAR \nwere deployed in this area to register, in continuous, passive seismic data for \none year. This dataset is a unique opportunity to achieve accurate earthquakes \nlocations and seismic sources. Accordingly, the main objectives of this project \nare: \n\ni) characterize the micro-seismicity in the study area; \n\nii) identify and characterize the mechanisms that control seismicity \ndistribution in the area;  \n\niii) understand the slip distribution in the active faults, in detail the faults \ninterference and strain partitioning mechanisms; \n\niv) contribute to the definition of the plate boundary in the SW Iberia-NW \nMorocco region, improve rheological models and define the limits of \nthe seismogenic zone. \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n2 \n \n\nI.1. Geodynamic setting of the study area \n\nThe Gulf of Cadiz is located in the Eastern termination of the Azores-Gibraltar \nFracture Zone (AGFZ), west of the Gibraltar orogenic arc and oceanic slab \n(Figure I.1). Here, the plate boundary zone between Eurasia (Iberia) \u2013 Africa \n(Nubia) has been described as diffuse because the tectonic deformation \nspreads across a broad area (Sartori et al., 1994, Zitellini et al 2009). The plate \nboundary is itself a matter of discussion because it appears that two types of \nplate boundary are present, i) a subduction zone under the Gibraltar arc \n(Gutscher et al., 2002) and ii) a transform type boundary accommodated by the \nSWIM dextral strike-slip faults (Zitellini et al., 2009). According to recent data \nthe central part is floored by Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous oceanic \nlithosphere (Figure I.1). This new finding is supported by seismicity distribution \npattern, tomography as well as refraction and wide-angle seismic profiles: \n\n? Preliminary results from NEAREST OBS experiment presented in \nGeissler et al. (2010). According to these authors, the depth distribution \nof the seismicity shows a pronounced pick at 50 km coherent with the \n600\u00b0C isotherm in Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous oceanic lithosphere \n(McKenzie et al., 2005). This limit would mark the base of brittle \ndeformation and the seismogenic layer; \n\n? Monna et al., (2012) presented a three-dimensional P wave upper-\nmantle tomography model for the southwest Iberian margin (and Alboran \nSea) based on teleseismic arrival time recorded by Iberian and Moroccan \nland stations and by the NEAREST OBS network. Because this study \nincluded a long-term instrumental coverage at sea, it resulted in a better \nresolve of upper-mantle structure. A clear high-velocity anomaly is \nimaged under the NEAREST array underlying the Horseshoe Abyssal \nPlain. The thickness of this anomaly (?80\u2013150 km) is compatible with an \nold oceanic lithosphere (~140 Ma, McKenzie et al., 2005) as speculated \nin Geissler et al. (2010). \n\n? New refraction and wide-angle seismic reflection data were acquired \nwithin the NEAREST project to study the crustal structure of the SW \nIberian margin. The P2 profile, roughly N-S, is a 340 km long profile \nacross from the central Gulf of Cadiz to the Variscan continental margin \nin the Algarve, Southern Portugal (see Figure I.1 for location and Figure \nI.2). The seismic velocity and crustal geometry model obtained in \nSallar\u00e8s et al.,( 2011) reveal three distinct crustal domains: a 28\u201330 km-\nthick continental crust in the north; an abrupt transition zone and a last \ndomain ?150 km-wide, with a ?7 km-thick crust of oceanic nature (>140 \nm.y.-old). In this last domain, absolute velocities in the bottom layer are \nlower than excepted probably due to fault related rock fracturing, \nalteration and mantle serpentinization (Sallar\u00e8s et al., 2011). Local low \n\n\n\nI. Introduction \n \n\n3 \n \n\nupper mantle velocities, between 7.8-7.9 km/s, were also identified in \nwide-angle multichannel seismic reflection profile by Gonzalez et al. \n(1996) in Iberian Atlantic Margin project (details on the project in chapter \nII). \n\n \n\n \nFigure I.1- Geodynamic setting of the studied area. On top is the location in the context of the \npresent plate tectonic model (AGFZ- Azores Gibraltar Fracture Zone; EU-Eurasia, Nu-Nubia \nand NA-North America, the base is National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \n(NOAA),ETOPO1 Global Relief Model). On the bottom is a simplified tectonic map and the \nlithospheric domains in the Gulf of Cadiz (tectonic structures adapted from Duarte et al., 2013, \nlithospheric domains from NEAREST refraction profile P1 and schematic map in Martinez-\nLoriente et al, 2013, NEAREST refraction P2 in Sall\u00e0res et al., 2011, AR-01 Multichannel \nseismic (MCS) profile from Rovere et al, 2004 and IAM-03 MCS profile from Gonzalez et al, \n1996).

Accordingly, the first \nevidences for tectonic rifting in the area remount to Triassic times and extended \nto the early Cretaceous.  \n\nThe Mesozoic continental extension was largely controlled by late Variscan \ninherited NE-SW extensional faults bounding rifting segments and future \nabyssal plains in the Southwest Iberia (Pereira and Alves, 2013). The 500 km \nlong Messejana\u2013Plasencia Fault zone (see Figure I.1) is intruded by a ~200 My \ndoleritic dyke (Youbi et al., 2003). Offshore this fault merges with the S\u00e3o \nVicente Fault and plays an important role in the recorded micro-seismicity \n(Terrinha et al., 2009, Pereira and Alves, 2013).  \n\n \nFigure I.2- NEAREST P2 Wide-angle and refraction profile, cutting across the central Gulf of \nCadiz and extending to the Variscan continental margin in the Algarve, Southern Portugal (see \nlocation on Figure I.1). The top image shows the refraction profile and the bottom image is a \nschematic interpretation of the different crustal domains. Note that according to the obtained \nvelocities model the ocean \u2013continental transition is abrupt, around km 160. To the S, the profile \nrevealed crustal seismic velocities probably defining a Jurassic oceanic Tethys realm. On top, a \nthick sediment cover related to the Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge ( in the referenced work \nrefered as imbricated wedge, Sallar\u00e8s et al., 2011). To North, upper and lower crusts define the \ncontinental domain. Low upper mantle velocities in the profile were related to serpentinization.  \n\nTo the South, in the Horseshoe Abyssal plain, the Horseshoe Abyssal plain \nThrust (HAT - Martinez-Loriente et al, 2013, see Figure I.3) separates a band of \n\n\n\nI. Introduction \n \n\n5 \n \n\nexhumed mantle (Sallar\u00e8s et al., 2013) of the Gorringe Bank and Tagus \nAbyssal Plain from the Western Tethys Basin. Serpentinization in this region is \nin agreement with the refraction data results on upper mantle velocities between \n7.2\u20137.4 km/s of Purdy (1986). \n\n \nFigure I.3- NEAREST P1 Wide-angle and refraction profile, roughly NW-SE. cutting across the \nTagus Abyssal Plain (TAP), the Gorringe Bank (GB), the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain (HAP), the \nCoral Patch Ridge (CPR) and ending at the Seine Abyssal Plain (SAP, Figure I.1 for location, \nMartinez-Loriente et al., 2013). The top image shows the refraction profile and the bottom image \nis a schematic interpretation of the different crustal domains. According to Sallar\u00e8s et al. (2013), \nNW sector of is an area of exhumed serpentinized upper mantle related to the opening of the \nNorth Atlantic Ocean (from TAP to HAP). To the SE, from the HAP to the SAP was identified an \nOceanic domain. The transition between the two domains is marked by the HAT -Horseshoe \nAbyssal plain Thrust.  \n\nBetween rifting episodes, the Gulf of Cadiz area is marked by several inversion \nepisodes, well described in the Algarve basin, lower Jurassic, middle Jurassic to \nupper Jurassic transition and upper Jurassic to early Cretaceous (Terrinha et \nal., 2002). These transient geodynamic setting was explained by combined \nprocesses: thermal subsiding episodes, local inversion of the oblique \ntranstensional tectonics and ridge push compression (idem).  \n\nFrom Late Cretaceous-Paleogene to Miocene, the convergence between Africa \nand Iberia was accommodated by a South Iberia subduction. Srivastava et al \n(1990) proposed subduction of oceanic crust beneath Iberia in Miocene times \nbased on palinspastic reconstructions of the oceanic magnetic anomalies. \nLonergan and White (1997) and Gutscher et al. (2002, 2006) proposed for this \nregion an east-dipping subduction slab below the Gibraltar Arc based on \ngeometric constraints of the final consumption of the Tethyan ocean in the west \nMediterranean and on tomography, respectively. \n\nDuarte et al. (2013), based on a new tectonic map, proposed ongoing \nsubduction propagation west of the Gibraltar oceanic slab into the Atlantic \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n6 \n \n\nOcean resulting from the propagation of compressive stresses from the \nGibraltar Arc and stresses related to the large-scale Africa-Eurasia convergence \n(see Figure I.4). Zitellini et al. (2009) mapped a 600 km long WNW-ESE striking \ndextral strike-slip faults (SWIM Faults, Figure I.1), connecting the Gloria Fault \noceanic plate boundary to the Rif-Tell Fault Zone in northern Africa, proposing \nthat this could constitutes the present day precursor of a transcurrent plate \nboundary in the region (Figure I.5). However, Cunha et al. (2012) based on thin-\nshell models for the lithosphere investigated the neotectonics of the Gulf Cadiz \nand concluded that models dominated by long SWIM faults (600km) would not \nreproduce the known deformation on the NE-SW, thrust system (e.g Horseshoe \nand Gorringe Faults). Neres et al. (2016) presented a neotectonic model \ncomprising the area from the West Mediterranea across the Gloria Fault. This \nmodel confirms the Cunha et al (2012) results and favors the existence of an \nindependent Alboran microplate. \n\nPresent day kinematic models for the Eurasia (Iberia) \u2013 Africa (Nubia) Plate \nBoundary, in the region of the Gulf of Cadiz, estimate a convergence of 4-5 \nmm/yr (Argus et al., 1989, DeMets et al., 1994, Nocquet and Calais, 2004, Stich \net al., 2006), with an approximate WNW-ESE to NW-SE horizontal motion \n(DeMets et al., 1994, Calais et al., 2003 Fernandes et al., 2007 and Serpelloni \net al. 2007). The average horizontal compression is defined as NW-SE, solution \nbased on borehole, focal mechanisms and moment tensor analysis (Ribeiro et \nal. 1996, Borges et al., 2001, Stich et al., 2010, Heidbach et al,. 2008). Stress is \naccommodated in main active faults (see detailed descrition in section I.2) and \nmajor lithospheric transitions.  \n\n\n\nI.

Main fault systems \n\nThe main active faults in the area were described in several studies trying to \nidentify the main seismogenic and tsunamigenic sources in SW Iberia (e.g \nZitelini et al. 2001, Gutscher et al., 2002; Gr\u00e0cia et al.2003, Terrinha et al. 2003, \nZitellini et al., 2004, Stich et al, 2007, Terrinha et al., 2009). Three main \nsystems are presented (Figure I.1): the accretionary wedge and subduction \nslab; the N-S to NE-SW striking thrusts system (e.g. Marqu\u00eas de Pombal Fault \nand Horseshoe Fault) and the WNW-ESE striking dextral strike-slip faults \n(SWIM fault system). An outline of these structures is presented next and \nresumed in the Table I.1. \n \nTable I.1- A resume of the dimensions and average slip along the fault estimations for \nsome of main active faults in the Gulf of Cadiz (data compiled from previous works). \n\nFault \nLength \n(km) \n\nWidth \n(km) \n\nDip \n(max) \n\nArea \n(km2) \n\nslip  \n(m) \n\nReference  \n\nSWIM 2 (LN) 130 50 90\u00b0  6500 6.3 Bartolome et al,. 2012 \n\nSWIM 1 (LS) 180 50 90\u00b0  9000 4.5 Bartolome et al,. 2012 \n\nHSF 150 120 45\u00b0  18031 10 \nMatias et al., 2013 \n(references therein) \n\nGF 200 80 40\u00b0  16000 12 \nMatias et al., 2013 \n(references therein)  \n\nSVF 50 140 45\u00b0  7050 10 \nMatias et al., 2013 \n(references therein)  \n\nMPF 60 120 45\u00b0  7012 10 \nMatias et al., 2013 \n(references therein)  \n\nAW 180 210 6.5\u00b0  37800 10 Gutscher et al., 2009 \n\nThe Accretionary wedge: \n\nThe accretionary wedge is a major westward directed shallow dipping thrust \nsystem, related to an active (or recently inactive) subduction zone under the \nGibraltar Arc. In bathymetry is described as U-shaped west dipping morphology \n(e.g. Duarte et al, 2013). Internally, it is constituted by w-verging thrusts, \nstacking a sequence of deformed sediments on top of a package of \nunderformed sediments, gently dipping towards the east (Figure I.6). According \nto Gutscher et al., (2002) this is tectonically driven (subduction related) rather \nthan by gravity sliding along a west-dipping surface (e.g. Maldonado et al., \n1999; Torelli et al., 1997).  \n\nThe N-S to NE-SW striking thrusts system  \n\nThe N-S to NE-SW thrust faults are related to prominent escarpments and root \ndeep into the basement, possibly extending into the upper mantle (Figure I.6, \nDuarte et al., 2011).  \n\n\n\nI. Introduction \n \n\n9 \n \n\nThe Marqu\u00eas de Pombal Fault (MPF) is a thrust fault with a trace >50 km, with \nmaximum uplift of 1100 m and the related deformed area is described as at \nleast 100 km in length (e.g. Zitellini et al, 2001). The MPF, combined with a \nBack-Thrust Fault (BTF), were described as good candidates for the 1755 \nearthquake source in Zitellini et al. (2001). In the same study, a depth \nconversion of the AR-10 profile is presented (Figure I.7), showing that the \ngeometry of the MPF-BTF system is consistent with a layer of hypocenters \ndistribution between 16 and 18 km in depth, marking a weakness in the crust \nwith a rupture area with the same order of magnitude as the 1755 event. In \nalternative, the HF has been proposed as an additional source area which \ncombined with MPF, could explain the 1755 earthquake (Ribeiro et al., 2006). \nThese two main tectonic structures would be connected by a transfer fault, \nstriking WNW-ESE. \n\n \nFigure I.6- NE-SW thrust fault system in the Gulf of Cadiz, including Gorringe, Horseshoe and \nMarqu\u00eas de Pombal faults as well as the Accretionary Wedge. A schematic profile shows the \nrelations between these structures and an east-dipping subduction zone (Profiles interpretation \nand schematic profile from Duarte et al., 2013).  \n\n \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n10 \n \n\n \nFigure I.7- AR-10 multichannel seismic profile (image from Zitellini et al., 2001)-a) with pos-\nstack time migration; b) Depth converted; A- syn-compression sediments, B- pre-compression \nsediments and C-acoustic basement defined as continental crust thinned during Eurasia-North \nAtlantic Mesozoic rift; Seismicity is from land network records from 1995 to 2000 (for details see \nfigures 1-2 in Zitellini et al., 2001). \n\n \n\nThe Horseshoe Fault (HF) is a NE-SW striking thrust fault, deeply-rooted, \ncutting through the basement down to the Moho (?) (see Figure I.8, Martinez- \nLoriente et al., 2016) and displacing the seafloor (Terrinha et al., 2009; Duarte, \n2011; Rosas et al., 2012, in appendix VI and Duarte et al., 2013). To the NE, \nthe fault scarp has a maximum height of 1000m decreasing gradually towards \nthe SW, the interference zone with the SWIM fault. In this particular area, new \nfaults were identified referred as corner structures. These faults have a \ndominant oblique movement, mainly dextral transcurrent movement (Figure I.9, \nRosas et al, 2012, in appendix VI). \n\nThe S\u00e3o Vicente Fault (SVF) strikes ?NE-SW steeply dipping to the SE flanking \nthe S\u00e3o Vicente Canyon (Figure I.6) with a reverse kinematic component. \nPereira and Alves (2013) depict in detail the offshore extension of the \nMessejana-Plasencia Fault Zone (MPFZ, see Figure I.1), which comprehends \nthe SVF. The onshore part of this fault is more than 500km long, cuts across \nPaleozoic folds and contains a tholeiitic basic dyke of ~200 Ma of age that can \nexceed 80m in width; these features attest for the deep origin of this fault, \npossibly cutting across the Moho. \n\nThe Gorringe Bank (GB) is a 5 km high seamount with a 9 m positive geoid \nanomaly and an elastic lithosphere thickness of 35km (Hayward et al., 1999, \nJim\u00e9nez-Munt et al., 2010 and references within). Girardeau et al. (1998) \nconsidered that the Gorringe Bank comprises a lithosphere composition mainly \ncomposed of serpentinized peridotites locally with a sheet-like gabbro intrusion, \nrare tholeiitic dikes and pillow-lavas. The present day structure, according to \nJim\u00e9nez-Munt et al. (2010), is controlled by a major NW verging, sub-crustal \nthrust fault - the Gorringe Fault (GorF in Figure I.1 and Figure I.6) with a ramp \nand flat geometry with at least 20 km shortening in 5-10 Ma (Late-middle \n\n\n\nI. Introduction \n \n\n11 \n \n\nMiocene). Tectonic and seismic activities are testified by major mass wasting \nprocesses. Lo Iacono et al. (2012) and Valadares (2012) identified several \nslumps, slide scarps and mass movements in the Gorringe bank flanks. \n\nThe Horseshoe Abyssal plain Thrust (HAT-Figure I.8) was defined by Martinez-\nLoriente et al., (2013). It is a NE-SW trending, NW-verging tectonic structure \nthat establishes the boundary between domains of Cretaceous exhumed \nserpentinized mantle and Jurassic oceanic crust (Figure I.1). More recently \nMartinez-Loriente et al., (2016) refined the NE-SW to a NNE-SSW trend, which \neventually may link to the MPF. \n\n \nFigure I.8- Regional synthetic lithospheric cross-section from Martinez-Loriente et al., (2016) \nillustrating the HAT and HF in depth. \n\nThe SWIM faults \n\nThe SWIM Faults (SWIM stands for South West Iberia Margin) (Figure I.9) were \nfirstly identified as WNW-ESE trending lineaments in MATESPRO swath \nbathymetry compilation (Terrinha et al, 2009 and Rosas et al., 2009) and later \ndefined as vertical faults with the same trend in Zitellini et al., (2009). These \nfaults host mud volcanoes and correspond to deep rooted dextral strike-slip \nfaults, cutting through the Mesozoic basement, upper-Miocene sediments up to \nthe sea floor present day sediments (Zitellini et al., 2009 and Rosas et al., \n2009). In the basement these structures are, at least locally, related with pre-\nexistent rift Mesozoic faults (Terrinha et al., 2009 and Duarte et al., 2011, in \nappendix VII). In both NEAREST refraction profiles P1 and P2, these structures \nare shown to extended into the oceanic crust (and possible into the upper \nmantle, Mart\u00ednez-Loriente et al., 2013 and Sallar\u00e8s et al., 2011). The SWIM \nfaults bathymetric expression is clear to the East, to the north of the Coral Path \nRidge, but become less prominent in the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain.  \n\nNeotectonic numerical modelling indicates that the SWIM faults should be \nregarded as discontinuous features (Cunha et al., 2012.) and not as mature \nlithospheric-scale features marking the present day plate boundary between \nNubia and Eurasia as suggested by Zitellini et al. (2009).  \n\nAccording to analogue modelling in Duarte et al. (2011, in appendix VII) the \nintersection pattern of the SWIM faults with the Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary \nWedge indicates that both tectonic structures are active in the Present. \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n12 \n \n\n \nFigure I.9- SWIM 1 fault and corner faults interpretation from Rosas et al., (2012 in attachment).  \n\nI.3. Seismicity  \n\nI.3.1.Historical seismicity  \n\nThe seismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz region is distributed, with events of low to \nintermediate magnitude, occasionally disturbed by strong earthquakes. An \nexample is the 1st November 1755 earthquake (Figure I.10 and Figure I.11) \nwhich had estimated magnitude of 8.75 (Richter, 1958 and Johnston, 1996) or \nM=8.5 (Solares and Arroyo, 2004). This earthquake will be discussed with more \ndetail in section I.3.1. \n\nAccording to Carrilho et al. (2010) the historical period is considered until 1960. \nFrom that year on it was installed the World-Wide Standardized Seismograph \nNetwork. Within the historical seismicity few events are known until the \nmedieval age as we can see in Figure I.10.  \n\nThe 63 B.C. earthquake is the first known historical event in the area of the Gulf \nof Cadiz (Figure I.10 and Figure I.11). It affected mostly the Portugal and Galiza \ncoasts and the estimated magnitude is 8.5 (Martins and Mendes Victor, 2001). \nAn associated tsunami may have forced the population to escape from near \ncoastal villages (Carrilho et al., 2010 and references therein). The 382 A.D \nearthquake with M?7.0 (Martins and Mendes Victor, 2001) caused a large \n\n\n\nI. Introduction \n \n\n13 \n \n\ndestructive tsunami that is associated with the disappearing of an existing island \n(Baptista et al, 2007 and references therein). In 24th of August 1356, a large \nearthquake located in the Horseshoe Abyssal plain (M?7.5, idem), was felt in all \nIberian Peninsula. Reports of the damages are similar to the 1755 event; \nhowever no tsunami evidences were described (Carrilho et al., 2010).  \n\nIn the 18th century, besides the 1755 earthquake, two other large earthquakes \noccurred in the area of the Algarve. The 6th of March 1719 earthquake was \nlocated in the area of Portim\u00e3o. The estimated magnitude was 7.0 or lower \naccording to Carrilho et al. (2010) and references therein, but the reported \ndamages are restricted to Portim\u00e3o and local villages. Also in Algarve, an \nearthquake struck Tavira on 27th December 1722. It was felt from the S\u00e3o \nVicente cape to Spanish borders. It had a tsunami associated that flooded \nTavira but had no significant effects in the other towns on the shore of Algarve. \nBaptista et al. (2007) based on numerical tsunami modelling and multichannel \nseismic profiles interpretation, estimated a magnitude ?6.5 and the epicentre in \nthe nearby submarine area, to the SSE of Tavira associated with NNE-SSW \ninverted thrust system, verging to WNW.  \n\n \nFigure I.10- Magnitudes distribution through time for historical earthquakes (from Carrilho et al., \n2010) \n\n \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n14 \n \n\n \nFigure I.11- Historical seismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz area. Events with M?7, with both \nmagnitude and \u201clocations\u201d from Martins and Mendes Victor (2001) \n\nI.3.1.1.The 1st November 1755 earthquake and tsunami  \n\nThe 1st November 1755 earthquake and tsunami was extensively studied over \nthe years. There are several historical documents describing this event that was \nfelt from Finland to the Azores and Cape Verde Islands. With estimated \nmagnitudes ranging from 8.5 to 8.8, it is one of the most destructive \nearthquakes in the History of Europe. The tsunami invaded Lisbon downtown \nroughly 250m and 10-15m waves were reported in S\u00e3o Vicente Cape. Its \neffects were described in Madeira, Cadiz and Cornwall, with water agitation \nexpressed in Scotland and Switzerland (Baptista and Miranda, 2009). Still, the \ntectonic source and mechanism of this event is a matter of discussion (see \nFigure I.12).  \n\nAn estimation of the source characteristics were drawn by various authors in \ncomparison with earthquakes from the instrumental record and/or based on \nevent description and tsunami evidences. Johnston et al. (1996) suggested that \nthe seismic source (based on isoseismal area, see Figure I.12) should have a \nfault length 180-200km, width 80 km and an average displacement of 10-14m. \nAccordingly, these authors proposed the northwestwards directed Gorringe fault \n(Figure I.1) as the possible seismogenic structure for this event. Gardin et al. \n(2007) based on simulation of ground motions also agree that the Gorringe \nbank should be the source area of this event. However, numerical models on \ntsunami propagation show incompatibility with this solution (Baptista et al, \n1998).  \n\n\n\nI. Introduction \n \n\n15 \n \n\n \nFigure I.12-The isoseismal lines for the 1755 earthquake and some of suggested source \nmechanism: Marqu\u00eas de Pombal Thrust, Gorringe faults and east dipping subduction zone \nbelow Gibraltar arc. Also the location and focal mechanism of the 28th February 1969 \nearthquake (are from Gutscher et al, 2006).  \n\nThe Marqu\u00eas de Pombal Thrust fault -Back-Thrust system was also proposed \nby Zitellini et al (2001).The authors associated this system to the seismicity \nobserved below the S\u00e3o Vicente Canyon. These events would mimic the \nrupture area of the 1755 Lisbon Earthquake (Figure I.7. and Figure I.12) \n\nRibeiro et al. (2006) discuss the different source solutions proposed for this \nevent. Besides the limitations referred to the Gorringe Bank Fault solution, \nthese authors point out that the MPF-BTF system does not fulfil rupture area \nrequirements. It is described other possibilities adding complement source \nareas to this system: a) Horseshoe Fault (HsF); b) Pereira de Sousa- Principe \nde Avis Fault system; c) Guadalquivir bank Fault (also in Baptista et al., 2003). \nThe authors favour the HsF-MPT solution based on the similar orientation and \nalmost geometric continuity between both fault zones, which facilitate \nstrain/displacement transfer between them. Other complex sources are \ndescribed by Vilanova et al., (2004) including the Lower Tagus Valley (LTV) \nfault near Lisbon. This fault is located in the Tagus River valley and would \nexplain the strong motion in Lisbon. According to these authors the isoseismic \npattern in Lisbon cannot be explained by an offshore source alone, arguing that \nthe main offshore shock triggered an onshore rupture in the LTV fault. \n\nGutscher et al. (2002, 2004 and 2006) and Thiebot and Gutscher (2006) \nproposed that the seismogenic source is related with an east-dipping active \nsubduction zone imaged on seismic tomography, below the Gibraltar Arc, also \nrelated with deep seismicity in Granada region. Gutscher et al. (2006) also \nsuggested that besides the subduction zone that would explain the seismic \nmoment associated with this event, an additional source located to the NW (in \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n16 \n \n\nthe area of the Gorringe or northern Gulf of Cadiz) is needed to account for the \ntsunami descriptions.  \n\nStich et al. (2007) scaled the source parameters of the 12th February 2007 to \nthe 1755 event, suggesting a fault length of 230 to 315 km and an average slip \nof 8.5 to 11.7m, for a seismic moment between 7 \u00d7 10  and 14 \u00d7 10  \nfor Mw= 8.5 and 8.7, respectively. The authors suggest that an active \nsubduction is not mandatory to generate the 1755 earthquake and agree in a \ncomposite multi-fault rupture including the Horseshoe fault and any other fault \n(eg. Marqu\u00eas de Pombal or S\u00e3o Vicente faults). \n\nMatias et al. (2013) proposed an improved method to define fault models for \ntsunamigenic events in the Gulf of Cadiz. The authors point out that a Mw 8.5-\n8.75 earthquake, with a seismic moment of 7.16 \u00d7 10  to 1.70 \u00d7 10 , \nthe rupture length would be of 143 to 220 km, the width from 119 to 120 km and \nan average displacement of 6.44 and 9.90m, respectively. This is true for a \nsource area in the Gulf of Cadiz but outside the accretionary wedge. Within the \naccretionary wedge the source dimensions are complex based on the \nparameters identified in subduction zones elsewhere. Accordingly the seismic \nsource would vary between a length of 282-315 km, a width 79-105 km and an \naverage displacement ranging from 7.8-10 m, for Mw 8.5 to 8.75, respectively. \nThe source parameters in the accretionary wedge area are roughly in \nagreement with Sitch et al. (2007) calculations. \n\nMore recently, Zitellini et al. (2009) suggested an alternative source solution \ncombining a 600km long active fault zone WNW-ESE dextral strike-slip with the \nHorseshoe fault. This solution would comprise a total rupture area of more than \n400km, compatible with the expected parameters to the 1755 event.  \n\nI.3.2.Instrumental seismicity  \n\nIn the instrumental record, the Gulf of Cadiz is the source area of the Ms?8.0 \n28th February 1969 earthquake (Figure I.13). The hypocenter was located \nbetween 22-33 km depth (L\u00f3pez-Arroyo &amp; Udias, 1972 and Fukao, 1973) and \nthe focal mechanism solutions point-out to a thrust with small strike-slip \nmovement, striking NE-SW, parallel to the Gorringe fault and dipping either NW \n(Fukao, 1973) or SE (L\u00f3pez-Arroyo &amp; Udias, 1972). The aftershock sequence \nhad one Mb?5.5 event with similar fault plane solution but located 50 \u00b1 5 km \ndeep (Grimison et al., 1986) or 29 km (Buforn et al., 2004), in the upper mantle.  \n\nTo the east is the location of the 12 February 2007, with Mw ? 6.0 and \nhypocenter at 40 km beneath the seafloor. The moment tensor inversion \nshowed a thrust with small strike-slip movement. The preferred fault plane is \ndiscussed both in Stich et al. (2007) and Cust\u00f3dio at al. (2011) with \ncontradicting results. Stich et al. (2007) indicate a NE-SW solution parallel to \nthe Horseshoe Fault but located in the footwall of this fault and dipping in the \nopposite direction. However, Cust\u00f3dio et al. (2011) refer to a WNW -ESE \n\n\n\nI. Introduction \n \n\n17 \n \n\nsolution, dipping 46\u00ba SW. For all the above cases seismic activity diverges from \nthe known active faults in the Gulf of Cadiz region. This event was also studied \nby Buforn et al, (2007) and selected the same preferred fault plane as Stich et \nal. (2007). Buforn et a. (2007) estimated Mw=5.9, a rupture area ?160km2, with \n14 and 12.5 km in length and width, respectively. The maximum displacement is \nof 0.63m. Much smaller is Stich et al. (2007) calculated dimension: an average \narea of 54km2, with fault length 8.2 and width 6.5km.  \n\nOther important events are the 29th July 2003 with Mw=5.3 at 40 km depth, in \nthe same area of the 12 February 2007 event. Pro et al. (2012) calculated the \nsource parameters: an area of 50 km2 and an average displacement of 0.08m. \nThe focal mechanism is also similar to the 12 February 2007 earthquake.  \nFinally, more recently is the 2009, 17th December earthquake with Mw=5.5, with \na rupture area of 113km2 and an average slip of 0.08. The moment tensor \ncorresponds to a dip-slip solution with a nearly NNE-SSW sub-vertical solution \nor a sub-horizontal plane NNW-SSE. The event was located in the S\u00e3o Vicente \ncanyon, at a depth of 36 km (Pro et al., 2012).   \n\n \nFigure I.13- Instrumental seismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz area (circles define low to intermediate \nmagnitude earthquakes, 2000-2015, recorded by Instituto Portugu\u00eas do Mar e da Atmosfera \npermanent seismic network, stars define the location of the highest instrumental events \nrecorded in this area, from Borges et al., 2001 references within, Stich et al, 2010 and Cust\u00f3dio \net al., 2016). \n\nThe seismic energy release during historical and instrumental periods (until \n2003) is presented in Carrilho (2005). The author compiled the information from \nfour different catalogues restricted to M?4 earthquakes. We show just three in \nFigure I.14: In Figure I.14A is shown a catalogue from the beginning of the \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n18 \n \n\nseismic network, in the early 60\u2019s to middle 80\u2019s (sec XX). It is clear that \nreleased energy pattern in our study area is completely disturbed and \ndominated by M=8, 28th February 1969 earthquake. During the period shown in \nFigure I.14B no high magnitude earthquakes were recorded. In this case, we \ncan observe a different pattern defined by the released seismic energy in the \nGulf of Cadiz. NW-SE alignments, sub-parallel to SH-max and a roughly NE-\nSW pattern coincident with the Gorringe Bank. Both features are coincident with \ndense seismic activity in Figure I.13. In Figure I.14C, all events are included \nsince the first historical earthquake until 2003. The pattern is completely \nsaturated by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.  \n\nThe patterns observed in Figure I.14 are somehow biased because they result \nfrom monitoring off-shore seismic activity (in the Gulf of Cadiz) based on an on-\nshore land permanent network. Carrilho (2005) presents an important study on \nthe seismicity in the Southwest Portugal Mainland. In his final remarks refers \nthat limitation on events locations resulting from land-network geographical \ndistribution can be overcome by ocean bottom stations network in Gulf of Cadiz.  \n\nPreliminary results from NEAREST OBS experiment were presented in Geissler \net al. (2010). The study is centred in a catalogue with 36 earthquakes (ML 2.2 to \n4.8). These events are concentrated at 40\u201360 km depth, near the base of the \nseismogenic layer and roughly align along two perpendicular directions, NNE-\nSSW and WNW-ESE striking structures. Each direction defines a hypocenters \ncluster, along the S\u00e3o Vicente canyon and the Horseshoe abyssal plain, \nrespectively. The study points out the necessity to evaluate seismic activity by \nmeans of OBS networks, since detailed information can be gained on \nhypocenter locations and fault kinematics (Geissler et al., 2010).  \n\nCust\u00f3dio et al, (2015, 2016) also reported the existence of hypocentres \nclustering in the Gulf of Cadiz, in the Gorringe Bank, the Horseshoe abyssal \nplain, the S\u00e3o Vicente Canyon and in the Guadalquivir Bank. According to these \nauthors, offshore seismicity shows intriguing features that can be better \nexplored with more accurate depth estimates as well as better estimates of \nabsolute epicentral locations. These would promote a more adequate dataset to \nenvision the relation between offshore clusters and seismo-tectonic structures. \n\nMore recently Grevemeyer et al. (2016) reported the results of a temporary \nOBS network deployment in the area of the Portim\u00e3o bank and the accretionary \nwedge. The experiment was 6 months long and resulted in a dataset with 86 \nevents located in ?6 stations. Most seismicity was located in the Portim\u00e3o bank \nwith depth between 15 and 40 km. If compared with Sallar\u00e8s et al. (2011) P2-\nNEAREST refraction profile, these depth ranges correspond to lower \ncontinental crust or uppermost mantle. The existence of seismicity at these \ndomains is rare. According to Grevemeyer et al. (2016), it might be caused by \nthe specific geological setting, where deformation occurs in cool lithosphere of \nMesozoic age, resulting in a strong lower crust and upper continental mantle. \n\n\n\nI.

However, this paper is \nbased on a global dataset that included exclusively shallow-focus continental \ninterplate or intraplate earthquakes of magnitudes greater than approximately \n4.5 which are not comparable with the Gulf of Cadiz geodynamic setting. \nInstead, Matias et al., 2013 formulation was specifically conceived for the Gulf \nof Cadiz area, although for large magnitude events. \n\nThe relation between fault dimensional parameters and the seismic event is \nestablished by the seismic moment definition:  \n\n=  \n\nWhere \u00b5 is the shear modulus, A is the fault rupture area (L*W) and u is the \naverage slip along the fault. We can access the Mo from the moment magnitude \nMw using the following relation: \n\n= log Mo\n1.5\n\n?  6.07, \n\n with Mo in Nm (based on IASPEI recommendation). \n\nSo, for a given Mw we can calculate the seismic moment. Since we are working \nwith NEAREST catalogue, we only have access to local magnitude estimations. \nThere is no clear relation between this magnitude estimation and seismic \nmoment. We will use the moment magnitude estimations for 3 common events \nreported in Stich et al. (2010). Also, we deduced the fault parameters for the \nlarger earthquakes in the Gulf of Cadiz and the area linking to the Gloria fault \nsystem. For events rupturing in the crust we assumed a \u00b5 = 4.0 \u00d7 10  Pa, for \ncrust and mantle rupture \u00b5 = 6.5 \u00d7 10  Pa and finally within the mantle \n\u00b5 = 7.0 \u00d7 10  Pa (based on Matias et al, 2013 and references within). We \nassume based on the available refraction data that the Moho depth is between \n10km and 15km. To estimate fault rupture we used the following definitions \nbased on Matias et al., 2013: \n\n=\n1.2\n\n \n\n \n\n=\n\u00d7\n4\n\n \n\n=\n\u00d7 4.8\n\u00d7\n\n \n\nWith = 1.8 \u00d7 10 .

Earthquakes dynamics and seismogenic limits \n\nFaults move at different speeds, ranging from m/s during an earthquake to \ncm/year at tectonic plate rates. Accordingly, slip is accommodated by slow-slip \ncreep, slow-slip seismic event and stick-slip. It is unclear how the transition \nbetween these slip mechanisms occurs (Peng and Gomberg, 2010). \nNevertheless, it seems that slip is largely dependent on specific characteristics \nof fault zones, such as frictional proprieties (e,g Sholz, 1998, Rice and Cocco, \n2005, Peng and Gomberg, 2010).   \n\nIt appears that frictional stability in fault zones is a key element on earthquakes \ngeneration, since earthquakes will occur mostly in pre-existing fault zones or \nanisotropy planes and rarely at newly formed fault planes. Brace and Byerlee \n(1966) defined that the earthquake cycle results from a stick-slip frictional \ninstability. The earthquake is the slip event and the stick period would explain \ninterseismic elastic strain accumulation interval. The transition from one stage \nto another depends on the nature of friction in the faults.  \n\nScholz (1998) explained that seismogenesis is determined by frictional stability \nand restricted to areas of unstable friction. This parameter was studied for \ndifferent rocks through experimental tests, resulting in several friction laws. The \nfollowing example is the one that best explains observation and it was given by \nthe Dieterich-Ruina law (in Sholz, 1998). \n\nI.4.1.Friction stability laws, aseismic and seismic slip  \n\nThe rate and the state of friction law is given by \n\n= ( ? )[\u00b5 + ( ? ) ln( / )] \n\nWhere  is the steady\u2013state frictional strength and dependent on the slip rate, \n, effective normal stress ( ? ), where  is normal stress and  is the pore \n\nfluid pressure in the fault. The initial friction coefficient is given by \u00b5  and the \ninitial steady-state velocity is defined by ,  defines the direct frictional \nresponse to the increase of slip velocity increase while  describes the frictional \nresponse in reverse transition (fast to slow, see Figure I.15). For ( ? ) > 0, \nthe fault segment has velocity-strengthening behaviour, so remains stable \n(creep) at seismic slip velocities. While for ( ? ) &lt;0, the fault segment has \nvelocity-weakening behaviour which results in unstable and potentially \nseismogenic area. This parameter is primarily dependent on material \nproprieties, resulting that some lithologies would favour velocity weakening \nbehaviour while others would have a velocity strengthening behaviour; seismic \nand aseismic, respectively. \n\nThe temperature has an essential control on the ( ? ) parameter. At low \ntemperatures ( ? ) can be negative and progressively become positive with \nthe increase of temperature. This transition is dependent in the mineral content \n\n\n\nI. Introduction \n\n23 \n \n\nof the fault zone. For granite, as is exemplified in Sholz (1998), the temperature \ntransition is 300\u00baC, coincident the onset of crystal plasticity of quartz. The depth \nin which this transition occurs depends on the local temperature gradient. \nAccording to the same author, this would explain the depth limit of earthquakes \nin the continental crust.  \n\n \nFigure I.15- A schematic representation of frictional (\u00b5) response to variation on the velocity of \ndisplacement in a rock experimental test. Note that a defines the frictional response to slip rate \nincrease while b describes an evolutionary response with velocity decrease. The difference \nbetween a-b defines the material response to changes in slip rate (for more details see \ntext).Steady-state weakening.  \n\nI.4.2.Dynamic weakening of the fault zone and the transition between \naseismic and seismic slip behavior  \n\nThe transition between aseismic stable creep and unstable stick-slip behavior is \nnot well understood and often assumed to be separated in space and to occur \non two different types of fault segment (Noda and Lapusta, 2013).  \n\nThese authors proposed a numerical model of a planar fault zone with \nheterogeneous rheology. In the model stable, creeping segments of a fault \nbecome unstable due to dynamic weakening. The rheological proprieties of the \nmodel was based on the laboratory measurements in samples from Mw 7.6 \n1999 Chi-Chi earthquake.  \n\nIn detail the model included two patches. Patch A with small dynamic \nweakening, ( ? ) &lt;0, tending to seismic slip and Patch B, with ( ? ) > 0, \nprone to creeping, with lower permeability and therefore more susceptible co-\nseismic weakening due to thermal pressurization of pore fluids. The two \npatches were surrounding by steady area, moving at the representative plate \nrate. The model results show frequent earthquakes activity in patch A. Only \nlarge earthquakes reach Patch B. In this last case, slip is larger in patch B. \nDuring the experiments, Patch B showed complex rheological behaviour: \ncreeping at tectonic strain rates, seismic slip contaminated by large events \noriginated from Patch A, and locked.  \n\nComplex rupture patterns were also observed resulting from the interaction \nbetween the two patches. In a simulation of the Tohoku-Oki earthquake (Mw=9) \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plates \nboundary SW Iberia- NW Nubia \n\n24 \n \n\nthe slip was firstly propagated mostly to the Patch A. Next, thermal \npressurization of Patch B promoted large local slip. This rupture increased \nstress concentration in Patch A causing re-rupture of the area.  \n\nThe authors conclude that fluids can cause stable fault segments to accumulate \ngreat amounts of slip, due to thermal fluid pressurization during high slip rates. \nUnderstanding the possible contribution of aseismic slip segments during co-\nseismic slip is fundamental to evaluate seismic hazard of not only of subduction \nzones but also of large strike-slip faults. \n\nI.4.2.1.Serpentinization as a weakening mechanism \n\nSerpentinization is present at several geodynamic settings where water \ninteracts with ultramafic rocks. Accordingly, it is common during continental \nextension in slow spreading centres; oceanic rifts and transform faults; in \nlithospheric scale strike-slip faults and in subduction zones. Serpentinites have \na distinctive rheological behaviour that results in an effective control on tectonic \nprocesses. The role of serpentinization on strain localization, seismic slip and \ncreep control at fault zones and of dehydration reaction on seismicity \ndistribution in subduction zones has been broadly studied both by experimental \nand nature observations (Guillot et al., 2015). \n\nOne key finding is that slightly serpentinized rocks have the rheology of pure \nserpentinites. Based on mechanical data, Escartin et al. (2001) demonstrate \nthat even for serpentine contents as low as 10 %, deformation is mostly \naccommodated along serpentinite bearing grain boundaries while olivine \nremains intact. Experiments demonstrated that serpentinization in fault zones, \neven if in lower percentage, will weaken and promote strain localization.  \n\nAmiguet et al. (2013) studied the deformation mechanism and rheology of \nserpentinites (lizardite and antigorite) in experiments and nature. Lizardite is \ndescribed as one of the most common serpentinite minerals at low \ntemperatures. It is stable at temperatures&lt;320\u00b0C and at pressures&lt;0.7 GPa \nabove these values starts the transition to antigorite. At natural strain rates \nLizardite shows brittle behavior and move towards a transition state at relative \nshallow depths and a shear stress > 100 MPa. Down to the deeper part of the \ncrustal faults, lizardite is ductile by plastic flow: glide and/or dissolution \nprecipitation. Also, lizardite has frictional proprieties with coefficient of internal \nfriction (\u00b5F) ?0.35, below most rocks (0.5&lt;\u00b5F &lt;0.8) resulting in lower frictional \nstrength than expected based on Beyerlee law. Subsequently, the presence of \nlizardite in oceanic transform faults could explain the weakness of these faults. \nAntigorite is the high temperature serpentine mineral. Ductile behavior starts at \nroughly 30km in depth and a pressure of 1GPa, extending down to ?90km deep \n(or at >700\u00b0C) where dehydration starts.  \n\nAnother shallow depth serpentinite species is chrysotile. This mineral is less \ncommon than lizardite, but it is more stable at high water/rock ratios. Moore and \n\n\n\nI. Introduction \n\n25 \n \n\nLockner (2004) evaluated experimentally the variation of this mineral \u00b5F with \neffective normal stress and temperature variation. At temperatures below 100\u00baC \nand low stress (<50 MPa), \u00b5F=0.1; at high normal stress and temperature \n(?281\u00baC and 200MPa) the frictional strength or \u00b5F is maximum ?0.55. It is \nworthwhile noticing that at temperatures below 100\u00baC, chrysotile shows velocity \nstrengthening at all strain-rates, and velocity weakening, in all experiments, at \n281\u00baC. At intermediate temperatures, the authors reported a combination of the \ntwo behaviours. This pattern is in agreement with the seismic and creep \nobservation in large strike-slip faults such as Hayward Fault, aseismic at \nshallow depth but probably locked bellow 5km depth, nevertheless associated \nwith large earthquakes (Moore and Lockner, 2004). \n\nHigh velocity friction experiments disclose dynamic weakening of serpentinite at \nseismic slip rates. According to Kohli et al. (2011) serpentinite displays velocity-\nstrengthening behaviour at plate tectonic slip rates but dynamic weakening at \nseismic slip velocities. The experiments indicate that only a few millimeters of \nslip may be required at near-seismic velocities to achieve a weakened frictional \nstate. Permanent frictional weakening may be related with Antigorite \ndehydration into talc, olivine and water (Kohli et al, 2011). Co-seismic \ndehydration of serpentinite, during large earthquakes, would lead to thermal \npressurization and consequent weakening of the fault zone (Lin et al, 2013).     \n\nI.4.3.The depth limit of the seismogenic zone \n\nThe strength of the lithosphere is a function of composition, crustal thickness, \nand geotherm (Ranalli and Murphy, 1987). Accordingly, these variables will also \ncontrol the depth limit of the seismogenic zone. \n\nThe rheological model of the oceanic lithosphere is defined by a strong brittle \nupper cover overlying a soft ductile layer (e.g. Mckenzie et al., 2005). The brittle \nstrength will increase as pressure increases with depth and ductile strength will \ndecrease drastically as temperature increases. The brittle-ductile transition \n(BDT) matches with the 600\u00baC isotherm and defines the depth limit of the \nearthquakes. It is also noteworthy that the 600\u00baC isotherm coincides with the \ntransition between the velocity weakening to velocity strengthening of the olivine \n(Boettcher et al., 2007). \n\nIn the continental lithosphere rheology is more complex. According to some \nauthors the seismogenesis is almost restricted to the crustal layer and there are \nlittle evidences for upper mantle earthquakes (Maggi et al., 2000). If restricted to \nthe upper crustal levels, then quartz is generally the phase controlling the bulk \nrheology of the upper continental crust (e.g Afonso and Ranalli, 2004, \nreferences therein). Earthquakes in the mantle are rare and also limited to the \ntemperatures below the 600\u00baC.  \n\nAt continental margins, in the continent \u2013ocean transition zone, lithospheric \nrheology reflects a compositional transition between oceanic and continental \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plates \nboundary SW Iberia- NW Nubia \n\n26 \n \n\ndomains. Accordingly, seismicity may be found at depths below from what is \nexpected at continental domains but above or at the limit of the adjacent \noceanic domain (Craig et al, 2011). \n\nI.5.

A short review \nof the most recent refraction and bathymetric data available is also provided. \nThe methods used for processing (and interpretation) of the data are then \npresented, along with a summary of the fundamental background theory. The \napplication details are developed in chapters III and IV dedicated to the \nseismological and geological interpretations, respectively.  \n\nII.1. Seismic network and instrument characterization  \n\nAs part of the NEAREST project, 24 ocean bottom seismometers (OBSs) and \nthe multi-parametric station GEOSTAR were deployed at the seafloor across \nthe Gulf of Cadiz for the acquisition of passive seismicity data. The German \nDEPAS OBS instrument pool deployment was coordinated by the Alfred \nWegener Institute (AWI) for Polar and Marine Research, and the experiment \ntook place from August 2007 to August 2008. The network distribution is shown \nin Figure II.1, including land stations (from IPMA- Instituto Portugu\u00eas do Mar e \nda Atmosfera and Instituto Dom Luiz-IDL) used in this work (Figure II.1).  \n\n \nFigure II.1 NEAREST OBS network and permanent land network stations used in this work \n(bathymetry from GEBCO-General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans). \n\n \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n28 \n \n\nII.1.1.LOBSTER network \n\nThe OBS specifically referred to as LOBSTER (Longterm Ocean Bottom \nSeismometer for Tsunami and Earthquake Research) were manufactured by \nK.U.M. Umwelt- und Meerestechnik Kiel GmbH, Germany. The deployment and \nrecovery was coordinated by Wolfram Geissler from AWI.  \n\nAll instruments were equipped with a G\u00fcralp CMG-40T broadband \nseismometer, incorporated in titanium pressure housing, a HTI-04-PCA/ULF \nhydrophone and a GEOLON MCS (Marine Compact Seismocorder) data logger \nfrom SEND GmbH Hamburg, Germany. The power supply both for seismometer \nand recorder was provided by 132 lithium power cells.  \n\nEach sensor channel was sampled at 100 Hz; preamplifier gain of the \nhydrophone channel was 4 and 1 for the three seismometer components \n(Figure II.2 and Table II.1). The total disk space of the stations was 20 GB \ncovering a recording time of 11 to 12 months, depending on the seismic activity \nin the area. The clocks of the data loggers were synchronized by GPS time \nbefore deployment and synchronized again after recovery of the instruments \nusing a SENDCOM-3 interface. The time difference was corrected linearly. The \nseismometers also incorporated a cardanic levelling mechanism, which started \nfew hours after the OBS reached the seafloor and re-levelled every 15 days. \n\n \nFigure II.2- A-LOBSTER system, B- G\u00fcralp CMG-40T broadband seismometer, C- HTI-04-\nPCA/ULF hydrophone and D- GEOLON MCS data recorder. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nII.

Some problems were detected and reported: levelling, \npower, time correction and OBS orientation (from NEAREST Deliverable 9 \nreport, 2009).

Data and methods \n\n31 \n \n\nThe power, memory use and time correction problems \n\nAt the time of recovery, 21 out of the 24 stations had already stopped recording \nbecause of lack of memory (\u201cdiskfull\u201d) and/or of power (\u201cbattery low\u201d) (details in \nTable II.2). These may be explained by the long duration of the acquisition \nperiod at a high sampling rate. The recording process stopped properly for the \n11 stations with full disks, allowing time synchronization (Table II.3). The \n\u201cbattery low\u201d message at 10 stations was unexpected, because the capacity of \nthe 132 Li cells should have covered 12 month recording. The power lost was \ntoo severe (with only one exception- OBS11) stopping the recorders\u2019 internal \nclocks which unabled time synchronization. \n\n \nTable II.3- Time drifts/year resulting from skew times measured onboard.  \n\n \n\nAnother problem rose from the actual skew times measured onboard which \nrevealed time drifts/year superior to the maximum expected drift of 1.46 \nseconds per year (for 8 out of 15 stations with synchronized time, see 30s-50 \nHz). Three methods were used to estimate clock drifts for unsynchronized \nstations and to reproduce the skew times measured onboard: noise correlation \nfunctions, P-wave residuals and P-wave residuals double differences. The \nresults from all methods showed coherency between them, with linear \ncorrelation ranging from 0.7 to 0.9 but none successfully reproduced time drifts \nhigher than 1.5 seconds per year. Additional information from previous \ncampaigns and also provided by Klaus Schleisiek from SEND pointed out that \nthe skew times measured onboard may have an error of integer values. \n\nP-wave arrivals residuals from the land stations and the P-wave residuals \ndouble difference were used as absolute time references to established final \ntime corrections to onboard measured skew times and unsynchronized station. \nThe final proposed set of clock drift and skew times applied to NEAREST AWI \n\nobs01 ??,\u2014 ??,\u2014 obs14 -3.89 -3.67\nobs02 ??,\u2014 ??,\u2014 obs15 -0.09 -0.08\nobs03 ??,\u2014 ??,\u2014 obs16 -4.56 -4.26\nobs04 1.53 1.46 obs17 ??,\u2014 ??,\u2014\nobs05 ??,\u2014 ??,\u2014 obs18 -2.77 -2.59\nobs06 1.50 1.43 obs19 -3.58 -3.36\nobs08 0.52 0.49 obs20 -3.46 -3.24\nobs09 ??,\u2014 ??,\u2014 obs21 -2.67 -2.49\nobs10 -0.12 -0.12 obs22 ??,\u2014 ??,\u2014\nobs11 1.05 1.00 obs23 ??,\u2014 ??,\u2014\nobs12 0.3 0.28 obs24 0.37 0.27\nobs13 ??,\u2014 ??,\u2014 obs25 -0.1 -0.07\n\nOBS\nDrift \n\ns/year\nskew (s) OBS\n\nDrift \ns/year\n\nskew (s)\n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n32 \n \n\nOBS are provided in Table II.4 (from Luis Matias 2011, Technical report on \nbehalf of NEAREST project). \n\n \nTable II.4- Proposed set of clock drift and skew times applied to NEAREST AWI OBS. \n\n \n\nOBS orientation problems \n\nThe orientation of the OBS on the seafloor is unknown and so the LOBSTER \nsystem was equipped with an electronic compass. However, the magnetic field \naround this equipment was dominated by the anchor system which conditioned \nany possible measurements. So, OBS orientations were estimated using P-\nphase polarization in teleseismic events (from NEAREST Deliverable 9, 2009). \nCorela (2014) also recovered OBS orientation using surface wave polarization \nin teleseismic events. He applied two different methods: Grigoli method and the \nStachnik method (details on the procedure in Corela, 2014 and on the methods \nin Grigoli et al., 2011 as well as in Stachnik et al., 2012) \n\nII.1.2.GEOSTAR \n\nThe GEOSTAR is a multidisciplinary observatory which comprises a set of \ngeophysical and oceanographic sensors for continuous data acquisition. The \nGEOSTAR project is coordinated by the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e \nVulcanologia \u2013INGV. The GEOSTAR bottom station (Figure II.3B and Table \nII.5) is equipped with a GEOSTAR Guralp CMG-40T seismometer 30s-50 Hz \n(OBS), Guralp CMG-5T accelerometer DC-100Hz (ACC), OAS hydrophone DC-\n50 Hz (HYD), all with a sample rate of 100 Hz and a DM24 GURALP digitizer \n(24 bit) (from NEAREST Deliverable 9 report). Time synchronization is \nperformed between a SERCEL rubidium clock and the GPS DM-24 channel. \n\nAccurate and safe positioning at seafloor, re-entry and recovery capabilities of a \nBottom Station are ensured by the dedicated cable suspended mobile docker \u2013\nMODUS (Figure II.3A).

Three types of data disturbances were reported (From \nNEAREST Deliverable 9 report in http://nearest.bo.ismar.cnr.it/): \n\n? A high amplitude disturbance (D1- Figure II.4) affecting all frequencies \nidentified in all components both in geophone and accelerometer \nrecords. It was transversal to all acquisition periods with a recurrence \ntime of 145s, lasting for 50s, and caused by anomalous re-levelling \nprocess; \n\n? A high frequency disturbance (D2- Figure II.4) with 1Hz and affecting \nfrequencies between 4-12 Hz; \n\n? A loss of data disturbance resulting from periodical rebooting of the \nSeismometer Data- handling Unit (SDU).  \n\nA \n\nB C \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n34 \n \n\nThe GEOSTAR group developed methods to correct disturbance D1 and D2 \nand results are displayed in Figure II.4. (from NEAREST Deliverable 9 report, \n2009). However, in our study we used the uncorrected record. \n\n \nFigure II.4- Signal corrections for disturbances D1 and D2 (in red original signal and in blue \ncorrected signal From NEAREST Deliverable 9 report in http://nearest.bo.ismar.cnr.it/). \n\nTime corrections problem \n\nThe GEOSTAR data was distributed with a time-correction applied, having a \ntotal drift of 184 ms after 359 days. However during tests to solve the LOBSTER \nnetwork synchronization problem, a 2s jump of the GEOSTAR clock close to the \nend of the deployment period was detected. To solve this unexpected \nobservation GEOSTAR was corrected using clock drift estimated by the P-wave \nresiduals double differences (as unsynchronized OBSs). A drift time correction \nof 1.925 in s/year and a skew time of 1.925 were therefore suggested \n(assuming that the acquisition time lasted exactly one year, information from \nLuis Matias, Technical report on behalf of NEAREST project). \n\nII.1.3.Permanent Land network \n\nThe land stations are distributed in a seismic network coordinated by the \nInstituto Portugu\u00eas do Mar e da Atmosfera (IPMA). The national seismic \nstations are owned by several institutions (see details on the land network in \nhttps://www.ipma.pt/pt/geofisica/). \n\nDuring the acquisition period 275 earthquakes were detected by the land \nnetwork within the deployment area (Figure II.5).The data recorded in this \n\nD1 \n\nD2 \n\n\n\nII. Data and methods \n\n35 \n \n\nnetwork during the acquisition period was used as a preliminary reference for \nthe earthquake events detected by NEAREST stations. Additionally, we used \nthe data recorded in a selected group of stations (closer to the study area) to \ncomplement focal mechanism solutions. A description and localization of these \nstations are given in Table II.6 and Figure II.5. \n\n \nFigure II.5- Epicenters locations of the events detected by land stations (closer than 75 km to \nthe nearest OBS) during NEAREST Project passive seismic acquisition experiment (blue \ntriangles are AWI OBS network, red triangle is GEOSTAR, black triangles land network stations, \nred circles are earthquakes locations provided by the Instituto Portugu\u00eas do Mar e da \nAtmosfera-IPMA, bathymetry from GEBCO). \n\n \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n36 \n \n\nTable II.6 \u2013 Details of the permanent land network seismic system (HH- High broadband, BH- \nBroad Band broadband, LH-Long period, HN- Accelerometer.

Multichannel seismic reflection and refraction profiles \n\nThe multichannel seismic profiles (MCS) studied in this work were selected from \nAcademia surveys (Figure II.7). Our analysis of the MCS was specifically \nfocused on the interpretation of passive seismicity results. Two main objectives \nwere considered:  \n\n? Delimitate seismic units to support the interpretation of the velocity and \nstations correction derived during events location procedures (all \navailable dataset, Figure II.7) \n\n? Investigate the geological control on the seismicity distribution (selected \nprofiles in Figure II.8). \n\nWe also completed the geological information with NEAREST and IAM wide-\nangle reflection/refraction profiles.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure II.7- All available multichannel seismic reflection and refraction profiles in the study area \n(except for NEAREST wide-angle reflection/refraction profiles depicted in the Figure II.8). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n40 \n \n\n \nFigure II.8- Location of the selected MCS and refraction profiles and NEAREST OBS network \n(in red dashed lines ARRIFANO survey, in orange dashed lines is IAM Survey, and in black \ndashed lines NEAREST wide-angle reflection/refraction profiles).  \n\nII.3.1.ARRIFANO Survey \n\nThe ARRIFANO (ARc RIFANO) MCS survey was carried out in 1992 (AR92) \nonboard the R/V OGS-Explora as part of a research project funded by the \nItalian Consiglio Nazionale delle Recerche (Sartori et al., 1994). The acquisition \nequipment included 32 air guns array, with a volume of 80 L, a 3 km long \nstreamer (with 120 receiver channels in 25 m groups). The shooting interval \nwas 50 m, the sampling rate 2 ms and the record extended to 13 or 14s TWT.   \n\nSeismic processing was performed in the Istituto di Geologia Marina of Bologna \nand included resampling to 4ms, CDP (common depth point) gathering, spiking \ndeconvolution, velocity analysis, normal moveout correction, stacking, spherical \ndivergence correction, sum adjacent 12.5 CDPs, finite-difference wave-equation \nmigration and time-variable filter. The time migration was made using stacking \nvelocity with a reduction 10% (Sartori et al., 1994). \n\nAfterwards, Rovere et al. (2004) reprocessed the 275km westernmost part of \nthe AR01 profile (Figure II.8). The processing sequence included trace editing, \namplitude balancing, normal moveout correction (NMO), common-midpoint \nstacking, predictive deconvolution, finite-difference time migration and time \nvariant band-pass filtering. This section of the profile was pre-stack depth \nmigrated. In Zitellini et al. (2001) is presented the AR-10 depth converted \n(location in Figure II.8). \n\n\n\nII. Data and methods \n\n41 \n \n\nII.3.2.BIGSET Survey \n\nThe BIG Sources of Earthquake and Tsunami (BIGSET) survey was carried out \non the RV/ Urania of the Italian Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, in the area \noffshore the Cabo de S\u00e3o Vicente. The project was founded by the European \nCommunity (Zitellini et al., 2010).  \n\nThe MCS reflection profiles were acquired using 4 SODERA-SSI GI-GUN air \ngun array, with a total volume ranging from 6.9 L to 8.2 L for deeper penetration \nsurvey. The high resolution survey was acquired using a single air gun with \nvolume of 2.46 L. The pressure was set to 138 bar and 130-200 bars, for deep \npenetration and high resolution surveys, respectively. The streamer was 1200 \nm long, with 48 active channels in 25 m groups. The cable was at depth ranging \nbetween 6 to 10 m and near offset was set between 142 and 158 m. The \nshooting interval was variable between 25, 37.5, 50 and 100 m. A pre-amplified \ngain was set to 30 db, the sample rate was 1 ms and the data record length \nbetween 8 and 13 s. The primary navigation system was DGPS (Zitellini et al., \n2010). \n\nThe data was recorded in SEG-D format. The procedure for MCS processing \nincluded: load geometry with CMP folding between 6 or 16 or 24 (100, 37.5, 25 \nm between shots); re-sampling to 4 ms; band-pass filter: 6-9-58-62.5Hz; edit \ntraces; hand statics:-20ms; true amplitude recovery; gapped deconvolution: \ndecon operator length 400 ms and prediction distance 24 ms; CMP sorting; \ninteractive velocity analysis; NMO correction and stacking; top mute; finite-\ndifference time migration; time and space variant Ormsby band pass filter and \nautomatic gain control (Zitellini et al., 2010). \n\nII.3.3.IAM Survey  \n\nThe Iberian Atlantic Margin (IAM) project was financed by the European \nCommunity Joule Program and coordinated by Enric Banda and Montserrat \nTorne from the Institute of Earth Sciences, Consejo Superior de Investigationes \nCientificas (CSIC, Banda et al., 1995). This project explored the nature of the \ndeep continental and oceanic crust in the Atlantic Iberia Margins. The \nacquisition campaign was designed to acquire near-vertical incidence reflection \ndata complemented by on-shore and offshore wide-angle and refraction data on \na few selected profiles, from the Cantabrian margin to the Gulf of Cadiz. In total \n3700 km of MCS seismic data were acquired on 19 lines. 43 land stations and \n19 OBS (Ocean Bottom Seismometers) were used for the acquisition of \nrefraction and wide-angle reflection data. GECO-PRAKLA was in charge of the \nmarine acquisition and it took place on board of the M/V GECO SIGMA, from \nAugust to September of 1993. \n\nThe IAM multichannel reflection seismic profiles were acquired using a 36 \nSWAG air-gun array with a total volume of 120 L and a pressure of 2000 psi. \nThe source depth was of 15 m and the shot interval of 75 m. The receivers were \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n42 \n \n\ndisplayed in a streamer with 192 groups with an interval of 25 m, with five \nauxiliary channels. The cable was at a depth of 18m. The near offset defined in-\nline was 254 m. The streamer length, between the centre of the first and last \nreceiver group, was 4775 m. The sample rate was 4ms and the record length \n25 s. No low-cut filter was applied in the acquisition system only a high-cut filter \nat 92 Hz with a slope of 72 dB/oct and a gain constant of 24 dB. The primary \nnavigation system was DGPS. \n\nThe acquisition format was SEG-D 20 bit binary, afterwards it was de-\nmultiplexed and converted to SEG-Y in the pre-processing sequence. The \navailable raw data was subdivided in five files in SEG-Y IBM floating point, Big \nEndian with headers in EBCDIC format. The 8 initial traces are auxiliary (test). \n\nThe processing sequence by Geco-Prakla comprised reformat from acquisition \nformat SEG-D to SEG-Y, bandpass filter with low cut 6 Hz(36dB/oct) and an \nanti alias high cut 55Hz (130 dB/oct), temporal resampling to 8ms, trace edit, \ntrace equalisation, spherical divergence correction using constant velocity \nfunction (1500m/s at 0ms and 6000m/s at 14000ms), least square predictive \ndeconvolution, FK demultiple, Normal moveout correction, space variant front \nend and inner trace mute, spherical divergence compensation, stacking, noise \nattenuation F-K filter, Kirchhoff constant velocity (1700 m/s) time migration and \ntime-space variant band-pass filtering. Jim\u00e9nez-Munt et al. (2010) converted to \ndepth the IAM-4 (Figure II.8) seismic profile using variable velocities of 1500 \nm/s for seawater, 2250 m/s to 3000 m/s for the sediment cover based on results \nproposed by G\u00f3nzalez et al. (1998). \n\nIn the present work we reprocessed and depth converted the IAM-GB1 profile \n(location in Figure II.8). The processing sequence included trace muting, in-line \ngeometry trace editing, velocity analysis, NMO correction, predictive \ndeconvolution, stacking, time migration and depth conversion. An overview on \nsome of the processing background is presented in this chapter and details on \nprocessing parameters will be described in Appendix V. \n\nII.3.4.NEAREST Wide-angle reflection/refraction profiles \n\nThe NEAREST project refraction profiles were acquired onboard of the Spanish \nresearch vessel R/V Hesperides in 2008. Two profiles were acquired (see \nFigure II.8):  \n\n1. Profile P1 is 340 km-long and resulted from a 30 OBS deployment array \nstarting at the Tagus Abyssal plain and extending to Seine Abyssal plain \n(strike approximately NW-SE), crossing the Gorringe Bank topographic \nhigh;  \n\n2. Profile P2 is 260 km-long, resulting from an array of 15 OBS and 9 \nlandstations, extending from South Portuguese zone and crossing the \n\n\n\nII. Data and methods \n\n43 \n \n\nGulf of Cadiz accretionary wedge (to East of the Coral Patch Ridge) \nstriking ?N-S. \n\nThe instruments used in this experiment include 19 Ifremer MicrOBS models \nwere provided by UBO-IUEM (Universite de Bretagne Occidentale - Institut \nUniversitaire Europeen de la Mer), 17 short-period L2000s model from the \nSpanish UTM (Unitat de Tecnologia Marina) and 9 Hathor landstations also \nprovide by UTM. The seismic source comprised two arrays with 7 Bolt airguns \n(model 1500 LL), providing a total volume of 70 L. The arrays were deployed at \na depth of 12 m, and the shot interval was set to 90 s. The processing details \nand interpretation were published in Sallar\u00e8s et al. (2013) and Mart\u00ednez- \nLoriente et al. (2014) for profile P1 and Sallar\u00e8s et al. (2011) for profile P2.  \n\nII.3.5.SWIM -2006 survey \n\nThe SWIM -2006 survey was carried out onboard the R/V Hesperides in 2006 \nas part of the Collaborative Research Project from European Science \nFoundation EuroMargins SWIM (\u201cEarthquakes and Tsunami Hazards in the \nSouthWest Iberian Margin: High-resolution imaging of active faults and \npaleoseismic signature\u201d).  \n\nA total of 16 profiles were acquired with 8 air guns array at a depth of 6m, with a \ntotal volume of 17 L and a pressure of 2000 psi. The shooting interval was 25 m \nto 37.5 m. The streamer had an active section of 2400 m with 96 recording \nchannels (in a group interval of 25 m). The near offset was 216 m and the cable \nwas at 7 m depth. The sampling rate was 2 ms with a pre-amplified gain of 20 \ndb, the record length ranged between 9 and 11s. The primary navigation \nsystem was DGPS \n\nThe processing work involved resampling to 4ms, trace editing, static recording \ndelay correction, true amplitude recovery, top mute, F-K and bandpass \nfrequency filter, predictive deconvolution, NMO correction (with constant \nvelocity of 1700 m/s), stacking, spiking deconvolution, Stolt FK migration (1500 \nm/s) and final band-pass filtering. Final stacks and time migrated profiles were \nexported in SEG-Y format (Gr\u00e0cia and Scientific-Party, 2006). \n\nPre-stack depth migrated and seismic interpretations of most of the SWIM \nprofiles are published in Mart\u00ednez-Loriente et al. (2013). \n\nII.3.6.VOLTAIRE survey \n\nThe Valuation Of Large Tsunamis And Iberia Risk for Earthquakes (VOLTAIRE) \nproject was supported by Italian and Portuguese funding Agencies. The \nVOLTAIRE survey was carried out on/board of the RV/Urania. The research \narea was located on the SW margin of the Iberia, from the eastern border of the \nTagus Abyssal Plain to the Guadalquivir Bank.   \n\nThe VOLTAIRE MCS reflection profiles were acquired using a 2 SODERA-SSI \nGI-GUN air gun array, with a volume of 3.4 L. The shot interval was set to 50 m. \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n44 \n \n\nThe receivers were displayed in a streamer with 48 groups with an interval of \n12.5 m. The cable was at a depth of 9 m. The sample rate was 1 ms and the \nrecord length ?12 s. The primary navigation system was DGPS. \n\nThe data was recorded in SEG-D format. The processing sequence included: \nre-sampling to 2 ms; edit traces; shot delay removal; true amplitude recovery; \npredictive deconvolution; CMP sorting; velocity analysis every 200 CMPs; NMO \ncorrection and stacking; band-pass filter and time migration using stacking \nvelocity with a reduction 10% (Zitellini, Matias, Rovere and Scientific-Party, \n2002). \n\nII.4. Processing the seismological data \n\nThe processing sequence of the seismological data included the following steps \nexpress in the Figure II.9. Events detection and phase identification were made \nin collaboration with Martin Romsdorf from AWI (Romsdorf, 2010). \n\n \nFigure II.9- Passive seismic data processing sequence. \n\nII.4.1.Detection and extraction \n\nThe seismicity identification is based on the principle that we can distinguish an \nearthquake from the continuous ambient noise record in a seismogram. Local \nseismicity signal is characterized by an impulsive start, high frequency waves, \nan exponential amplitude envelope and a decrease in signal frequency in time. \nAnother feature transversal to all type of seismic events (local, regional or \nteleseismic) is that the dominant wave period generally increases with time, \nstarting from the moment of the first arrival, while other transient signals usually \nmaintain the same dominant period throughout the duration of the events (Lee \nand Stewart, 1981). The identification of these events can be performed using \ndifferent techniques; in our particular case we used spectrogram and automatic \ntriggering analysis.  \n\nII.4.1.1.Spectrogram analysis \n\nThe spectrogram analysis consists of the examination of the average spectral \ncontent of the seismograms recorded in the vertical seismometer component. \nDaily spectrograms can be generated and converted into bitmap images, \nallowing the interpreter to visually identify spectral amplitude variations during \nseismic events by changes in a predefined colour palette.

Data and methods \n\n45 \n \n\nsame area are plotted together, then an earthquake can be recognized as a \nlinear alignment in the spectrogram.  \n\nTo define the spectrogram, n spectral points are extracted (that must be a \npower of 2) and centred in each sample to be analysed. The Fast Fourier \nTransform (FFT) of that series is then computed. The FFT will transform the \nseismic signal from temporal into its frequency domain, needed to compute the \nspectrogram. There is no windowing applied to the data; only the linear trend is \nextracted. Ultimately, n/2 spectral amplitude points are produced. These \namplitudes are averaged, decimated and plotted in the spectrogram (Figure \nII.10). The size of the sliding time-window, the averaging and plot limits define \nthe frequency interval and the spectral window that is plotted. \n\n \nFigure II.10- Spectrogram of the vertical component in the NEAREST seismometers. An \nseismic events is observed as a linear disturbance common (in this example) to all stations \n(OBS 2 and 11 were not acquiring data). \n\nII.4.1.2.Automatic triggering analysis \n\nDifferent types of triggering algorithms are available, whether based on \namplitude changes only or using more complex recognition systems. The \u2018short-\ntime-average through long-time-average\u2019 (STA/LTA) trigger algorithm is the \nmore commonly used.  \n\nThe STA/LTA algorithm calculates the average values of the absolute amplitude \nof the seismic signal in two consecutive moving time windows. The short time \nwindow (STA) scans for a seismic event and the long-time window (LTA) \ndefines the background amplitude of the seismic noise. When the ratio of STA \n/LTA (trigger ratio) reaches a pre-set value an event is declared. The event is \nconsidered finished when the STA /LTA ratio decreases to another pre-set \nvalue - detrigger ratio.  \n\nThe length of the STA and LTA windows depend on the distance between the \nsensors and the average distance to a seismological active zone (Munro, 2004 \nand references within). The STA window must be defined for a period superior \nto the expected duration of the seismic event. However, it should not be \nsignificantly longer than the shortest event to be investigated. If the window is \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n46 \n \n\nvery large, it no longer defines the envelope signal signature of the expected \nseismic event but the average amplitude of this event and the background \nseismic noise. Consequently, the sensitivity to detect small earthquake events \n(local events) is reduced. Hence the type (local vs distant) of events to be \nidentified should be selected and prioritized. On the other hand, decreasing the \nSTA window increases the sensitivity of the algorithm and this can induce \ntriggering of false events. The LTA window should be a few periods longer than \nthe typical irregular seismic noise variations. A typical LTA window is 60s. \n\nThe selection of the STA/LTA trigger threshold level is a crucial step because it \ndetermines which events will be extracted. High STA/LTA trigger threshold level \ndecrease false triggering but could exclude a higher number of earthquakes. \nDefining a lower threshold level increases both false positives and events \ndetection. In quiet seismic sites, the typical trigger threshold value is 4, but for \nstations located far from any man-made noise, such as deep marine \nenvironments, this value can be lower. The de-trigger threshold level \ndetermines the extension of the event detected. Very high levels prevent the \nextraction of long events while low levels include longer records with \nunnecessary data.   \n\nAnother important parameter is the triggering pre-filter design. The filter is \ncritical particularly for broadband seismometers with large response band \n(LOBSTER-60s-50Hz). The pre- triggering filter helps prioritize the frequencies \nto the dominant range of the seismic event of interest and attenuate or discard \nthe effects of unwanted seismic background noise. Limiting the extraction of \nevents when detected in a predefined number of seismic stations excludes \nearthquakes that cannot be located (details on the used triggering parameters \nare in the subchapter III.2.1).  \n\nII.4.2.Earthquake location \n\nThe earthquake location is defined by the hypocenter coordinates and origin in \ntime. It can be determined from absolute or relative methods. In absolute \ntechniques, events locations are referred to fix geographical and time systems \nwhile in relative methods earthquakes are located based in another event \n(master event) or relative to each other.  \n\nThe determination of absolute earthquake locations depends on several factors \nincluding survey network geometry, seismic phase identification and accuracies \nof the arriving time readings. Another important factor is the influence of the \nvelocity structure of the crust and mantle that are traversed by the seismic rays. \nThe application of one dimensional velocity models to determine hypocenter \nlocation in a tri-dimensional variable space also creates limitations. This \nproblem is particularly dominant when there is a high lateral variability in the \nlithospheric structure. To minimize the latter aspect, absolute location methods \n\n\n\nII. Data and methods \n\n47 \n \n\ncan include station corrections or jointly determine velocities, hypocenters \nlocations and station delays.  \n\nRelative location (e.g. double difference earthquake location algorithms) \nmethods can also minimize errors resulting from tri-dimensional geological \nvariability. Even when using simultaneous inversion techniques with stations \ncorrections, improvements can still be made by using the double difference \ntechnique too. The double-difference method allows a precise earthquake \nlocation because it is based on the similitude between seismic events within the \nsame cluster. A description of the main background concepts behind \nearthquake location is provided in the next section.  \n\nII.4.2.1.Stating the problem \n\nThe earthquake locations are determined based on the records registered in the \nseismometers located on the Earth\u2019s surface. Features, such as arrival time and \namplitudes of the seismic waves are recorded by the seismic network. The \nlocation of the earthquake is then derived by matching an observed arrival time \nfor seismic phases at the seismic stations and the calculated arrival times \nbased on a hypothetical source location. Plausible velocity models are used to \ncalculate theoretical arrival times. Hence, determining events location is an \ninverse problem where the observed data is arrival time and the unknowns are: \nspatial coordinates of the hypocenter, the origin time and velocity model. The \nforward problem is expressed mathematically by: \n\n=  ( , ) (1) \n\nWhere d is the arrival time, m is the location model and  denotes the velocity \nmodel. In the forward problem, changes in d derived from known modifications \nin  ( , ) can be predicted. By contrast, the inverse problem involves solving \nthe changes in  ( , ) that yield the required data d. The best model is the one \nthat produces the smallest misfit (tres) between the observed data ( ) and the \npredicted data ( ):  \n\n= ? (2) \n\nFor a source location ?src (x) and recording station coordinates ?sta (x), the \narrival time can be defined by: \n\n= +  =  + ? ( )  (3) \n\nWhere t0 is the origin time, u is the model slowness (inverse of the seismic \nvelocity) and x denotes a vector of spatial coordinates reproducing the ray path. \nAny change to the location results in the alteration of the ray path, and \nconsequently of the seismic velocity. Similarly, changing the seismic velocity \nmodifies the arrival time and therefore the earthquake location. This \ndependence is nonlinear and is referred as the coupled hypocenter-velocity \nproblem. The hypocenter parameters, except for the origin time, are strongly \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n48 \n \n\nnonlinear and velocity parameters are moderately nonlinear (Kissling et al. \n1994). Applying a first-order Taylor series expansion to (2, 3) yields a linear \nrelationship between travel time residuals (tres) and adjustments in hypocentral \n(? ) and velocity (? ) parameters (e.g Kissling et al., 1994)  \n\n= ?  = ? , ?? + ? , ?     (4) \n\nIn matrix notation: \n\n= ? +        (5) \n\nWhere t is the vector of travel time residuals, H is the matrix of partial derivates \nof travel time with respect to hypocentral parameters (origin spatial coordinates \nand time) and h a vector with hypocentral parameters adjustments, M is the \nmatrix of partial derivates of travel time with respect to velocity model \nparameters and m the vector of velocity model adjustments. \n\nAssuming that the velocity model is known (based on previous seismological \nand refractions data), the location problem can be reduced to hypocentral \nparameters by removing the Mm from the linearized approximation. In that \ncase: \n\n= ?  = ? , ??       (6) \n\nAnd in detail for a station : \n\n = ? + ? + ? + ?      (7) \n\nOr in the matrix notation: \n\n = ?     (8) \n\nThe formulation of the earthquake location problem in this linear form is known \nas the Geiger method. However, ignoring the velocity parameter in the \nearthquake location problem introduces systematic errors to our solutions \n(Kissling et al., 1994). A successful solution can only be reached by \nconstraining the initial velocity model based on dense geophysical data. The \nGeiger method (and modified versions) is used in several location programs \nincluding the HYPOCENTER 3.2 (details on Lienert, 1994) integrated in the \nSEISAN 9.01 package (Havskov and Ottem\u00f6ller, 2011) used for the preliminary \nlocation of earthquakes in our study.  \n\nOnce an adequate velocity model has been established, the location is \nconstrained by the hypocentre parameters which represent 4 unknowns (the \nhypocenter coordinates and their origin in time). A solving equation is devised \nfor each arrival time. The system can be determined using three seismic \nstations with four phase picking. However, a seismic network commonly has \nconsiderably more observations and the problem is overdetermined, meaning \nthat a unique solution cannot be obtained. However, using a higher number of \n\n\n\nII. Data and methods \n\n49 \n \n\nrecording stations allows to constrain redundancy errors in arrival times related \nto phase picking, clock synchronization, reading errors and systematic \ndiscrepancies between real velocity structure and velocity model.  \n\nAn iterative approximation starting with a trial hypocenter solution (derived from \nthe closest station) is used to solve the system with iterative corrections applied \nuntil the best solution is reached, minimizing the difference between observed \nand calculated arrival times in M stations. For most locations, programs use root \nmean square approximation to define the best solution: \n\n=  ?      (9) \n\nWhere  is the temporal difference between the  and  (for a station  \nand a event source ). \n\nII.4.2.2.Joint Hypocentral Determination (JHD) \n\nAssuming that the 1 D velocity model is well constrained, station correction \ndelays must also be applied to yield the correct location of the earthquakes. \nThese corrections combine not only errors related to the record acquisition and \nprocessing but also associated with the tri-dimensional subsurface geological \nstructure variability below the seismic network. The Joint Hypocentral \nDetermination (JHD) technique uses the simultaneous location of a group of \nevents and common station corrections determinations. According to Pujol \n(2000), the resulting stations corrections can be related to un-modeled lateral \nvelocity variations.  \n\nThe JHD is distinct from single-event location approaches because it includes a \nstations corrections term ( ). Considering a group of earthquakes M recorded \nin N stations the JHD formulation is: \n\n   = ( + + + + )    (11) \n\nWith  \n\ni=1, N;     j=1, M \n\nand \n\n =  ? ( + +  )      (12) \n\nWhere  is the observed arrival time and the remaining terms of the equation \nrefers to the calculated arrival time,  being the computed initial origin time,  \nthe travel time based on a hypothetical hypocentral location and   is the initial \nstations corrections. The term   refers to quality weights in stations readings. \nThe partial derivates elements are the adjustments that must be determined. \n\nIn matrix notations the equation can be written as: \n\n + =       = 1,      (13) \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n50 \n \n\nWhere W is the stations weight matrix, A is the adjustments partial derivates, \ndXj is the earthquake locations corrections, ds the stations delays and rj is the \nresiduals vector. The JHD problem must solve all the terms of the equation \nsimultaneously (see Pujol, 2000 for further details).  \n\nAn approximate JHD technique was introduced by Frolich (1979). It uses single-\nevents location and average stations residuals (Pujol, 2000), and adopts the \nfollowing processing sequence: \n\n1. Determination of earthquake locations individually; \n\n2. Determination of  average individual station delays based on all \nearthquakes; \n\n3. Determination of the individual locations of earthquakes using \nstations corrections from step 2; \n\n4. Iteratively improvement of earthquake location by repeating steps 1-\n3. \n\nThis is equivalent to solving the different terms of equation 13 individually. \nSolving step 1 corresponds to solving equation 13 for ds=0 and step 2 without \nearthquake location term. The station residuals are defined by (Pujol, 2000): \n\n=\n?\n\n?\n     (14) \n\nAn JHD approximation was applied in data investigated here by combining \nHYP2 (a modified version by Luis Matias of HYP application from SEISAN 9.2 \npackage, Havskov and Ottem\u00f6ller, 2011) which allowed individual stations \ndelays for p and s readings.  \n\nII.4.2.3.Simultaneous inversion  \n\nAn accurate constraint of the velocity structure of the crust and upper mantle for \na determined region is very difficult to obtain. In particular, excluding velocity \nparameters from the coupled hypocentre-velocity formulation (eq. 5) can \nintroduce systematic errors in earthquakes locations (Kissiling et al., 1994). In \nthe simultaneous inversion method hypocentral, velocity and station correction \nare jointly determined. The formulation can be written in matrix notation as: \n\n= ? + +e     (15) \n\nWhere t is the residuals between observed and calculated arrival times, H is the \nmatrix of partial derivates of travel time with respect to hypocentral parameters, \nh is the vector of hypocentral parameters adjustments, M is the matrix of partial \nderivates of the travel time with respect to velocity model, m is the vector of \nvelocity model adjustments and e is the vector of travel time errors, resulting \nfrom errors in observations (stations coordinates, in measurements), in the use \nof wrong hypocentral and velocity parameters and errors related to the \nlinearization of the coupled hypocentre-velocity formulation. \n\n\n\nII. Data and methods \n\n51 \n \n\nThis formulation is highly dependent on the parameterization of the problem. \nOne of the limitations derives from the velocity model layers structure used as \ninput. During processing steps, the velocity value of each layer can fluctuate to \nfind a better solution for events location. On the contrary, the number of layers \nand its thickness remains fixed. Therefore the validity of the hypocentre-velocity \nformulation solution is dependent on the specific structure of the initial velocity \nmodel. One way to overcome this limitation is to use previous knowledge on \ninterface depth (e.g. refraction-reflection seismic profiles) to limit interface \ndepths distribution. In the absence of previous data, several layers structures \nshould be tested without exaggerated complexity. Beyond a determined \ncomplexity, the model becomes unrealistic. Moreover, the earthquakes ray \npaths does not comply with the necessary constraints to solve the model \nvariability and the problem becomes underdeterminate.  \n\nOther restrictions originate from hypocentral distribution if earthquakes have \nlimited depth distributions. In this case, the velocity model converges rapidly to \nan optimum solution within these layers but may not achieve a constrained \nsolution for depth intervals having low earthquakes distributions. The best \nsolution is obtained in the layers common to most ray-paths between the source \narea and all the seismic stations. Consequently, less accuracy is expected in \nsubsurface layers below seismic stations and below the depth limit of the \ndistribution of the hypocenters. In our study we used the VELEST (details on \nthe method in Kissiling, 1995) application to compute the velocity model, the \nlocations and stations corrections (see chapter III.3.2). \n\nII.4.2.4.Relative location methods based on double difference (HypoDD)  \n\nAs referred before, one of the main constrains on earthquake location comes \nfrom using one dimensional velocity models (even if well known) to determine \nhypocenters locations in a tri-dimensional variable lithosphere. We can \nminimize this difficulty by using 3-D simultaneous inversion methods or, \nalternatively, double-difference techniques.  \n\nThe double difference approximation for earthquake location is based on the \nassumption that if two events are recorded in the same station and the \nhypocentral distance between them is smaller than the events-station distance \nas well as the lateral variability of the velocity model then the ray-paths are \nsimilar along most of the distance linking events origin-recording station. So, the \ndifference in travel times is related to the space offset in events sources and it is \nnot necessary to use station corrections.  \n\nThe accuracy between relative arrivals times can be improved by waveform \ncross-correlation, assuming that both events are related to the same source \nmechanism and therefore produce similar seismic signatures in a common \nrecording station (Waldhouser and Ellsworth, 2000). The method can be used in \ncluster analysis but also in larger distances by cross-correlating pairs of events \nacross the area (see Figure II.11). A minimum distance within pairs of events \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n52 \n \n\nmust be respected as a condition. In these, the slowness component in \nequation 3 must be constant across ray-paths to the receiver station.  \n\n \nFigure II.11- Double difference method. Solid and open circles represent trial hypocenters that \nare linked to neighboring events by cross-correlation (solid lines) or catalog (dashed lines) data. \nFor two events, i and j, the initial locations (open circles) and corresponding slowness vectors, \ns, with respect to two stations, k and l, are shown. Thick arrows (?x) indicate the re-location \nvector for events i and j obtained with double difference method and dt is the travel-time \ndifference between the events i and j observed at station k and l, respectively (from Waldhouser \nand Ellsworth, 2000). \n\nEquation (6) can be rewritten for events i and j as: \n\n?  ??  =    (16) \n\nWhere ?  is the difference relative hypocentral parameters for events i and j, \n\n are partial derivates of travel time between event source and receiver station \n\n(including a component of slowness). is the residual between observed and \ncalculated arrival times between the two events: \n\n= ( ? ) ?  ( ? )     (17) \n\nTo assure that the slowness vector across the raypaths is constant this \ndifference can be written as: \n\n?  ?? ?  ?  ??  =    (18) \n\nAssuming a slowness vector and origin time for each event. \n\nSolutions are found by iteratively adjusting the vector difference between \nnearby hypocentral pairs, with the locations and partial derivatives being \nupdated after each iteration (Waldhauser, 2001). The double-difference \nresiduals for pairs of earthquakes at each station are minimized by weighted \nleast squares. We used HypoDD program package (Waldhauser, 2001) for \nrelocating our dataset with the double-difference algorithm (details in chapter \nIII.3.3).  \n\n\n\nII. Data and methods \n\n53 \n \n\nII.4.3.Determine focal mechanisms and the regional stress tensor \n\nII.4.3.1.Introduction  \n\nThe way rocks react to stress depends on how large the stress is and for how \nlong it is applied. Provided the applied stress remains below the yield stress \n(elastic limit) the short-term behaviour is elastic. An earthquake takes place \nwhen the elastic yield strength of the local rocks is exceeded and failure occurs. \nHowever, away from the rupture area the rocks\u2019 coherence is preserved. \nSeismic waves will therefore spread out by elastic deformation inducing ground \nmotions reflecting the relative movement of the two sides of a source fault. \nThese seismic waves are recorded in seismic stations. If earthquakes are \ncaused by faulting then we can deduce the fault kinematics from an adequate \nset of seismograms and in turn the characteristics of the stress field acting on \nthat region, as discussed below. \n\nII.4.3.2.Focal mechanism \n\nFor most micro or local earthquakes networks, fault plane solutions are derived \nonly from P-wave first motion polarity. Compared to waveform inversion \nmethods, P-wave first motion polarities are still useful to constrain the source \nmechanisms for micro-seismicity studies, due to their waveform complexities \nthat cannot be modelled by simple and smooth velocity structures. Figure II.12a \nshows the P-wave radiation pattern for a pure-strike slip fault. Since the \nradiation pattern of the seismic wave is dependent on the fault geometry and \nkinematics we can use it to work out the fault plane solution. If the radiation \npattern induces the material to move away from the source fault area, then the \nfirst motion is compression. By contrast, if the material moves towards the fault \nsource then the first motion is dilation. On the receiver stations, the \nseismograms record positive polarities, or upwards P-wave first motion, and \nnegative polarities, or downwards P-wave first arrivals, respectively (see Figure \nII.12a). \n\nThe locations of compressions and dilatations leaving the fault zone are defined \nas points in a focal sphere. The first arrival polarities (observed at the receiver \nstations) are represented in the lower hemisphere and projected using the equal \narea stereographic representation. This is depicted in Figure II.12b. Each \nreceiver station defines a polarity measure on the focal sphere (solid represents \ncompression and open refers to dilatations -Figure II.12c). The first motions will \ndelineate four quadrants, separated by two nodal planes (fault and auxiliary \nfault planes) along which there is no radiation of P-waves. The bisectrices of \ndilatation and compression quadrants are coincident in the maximum and \nminimum compression directions, respectively (Figure II.12d). The maximum \nstress is denoted by the P-axis while the minimum stress direction is defined as \nthe T-axis. The B axis- indicates the intermediate stress and is perpendicular to \nboth P and T axes. Note that from the radiation pattern in Figure II.12a it is \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n54 \n \n\nimpossible to define which is the preferable fault plane. The solutions for both P \nand T axes define a force system that is defined as a \u201cdouble-couple\u201d (or DC). \nNon-DC sources, representative of complex rupture histories or including an \n\u201cexplosive\u201d component, cannot be evaluated by the P-wave polarity method \noutlined here. \n\nThe focal mechanism solutions are defined by strike, dip and rake. Strike ? is \nmeasured between 0\u00b0 and 360\u00ba. The convention for its measurement assumes \nthat: the strike direction is defined by the horizontal line in the foot-wall of the \nfault-plane and its orientation is established by the right-hand rule. The dip ? is \nmeasured perpendicularly to the strike direction and the rake ? is the direction \nalong the slip on the fault and is bounded between \u2013 180\u00b0 and 180\u00b0, where \nreverse fault is 0\u00b0<?<180\u00b0, normal faults between -180\u00b0 and 0\u00b0 and right lateral \nstrike-slip if ?=180\u00b0 and left if ?=0\u00b0 (Snoke, 2003). In this work two different \nmethods (FOCMEC and FPFIT) were applied to estimate the focal mechanism \nsolution. Both methods use a grid-search method to find the best fitting focal \nmechanism for the observed polarities. \n\n \nFigure II.12- Determining focal mechanism solution based on the polarity P-wave first motion  \na) P-wave radiation pattern (details in the text) b) ray-path and the focal sphere where ? is the \nstrike and i0 is the angle of emergence c) subdivision in quadrants and d) focal mechanism \nsolution (adapted from World Stress Map Project guideline for focal mechanisms). \n\n \n\nCross-correlation and sequence analysis \n\nCross-correlation analysis is used to compare the P and/or S waves of closely \nrelated earthquakes that could result from the same seismic source. For closely \nrelated seismic activity it can be useful to define the location and geometry of \n\n\n\nII. Data and methods \n\n55 \n \n\nthe seismogenic source zone. This is particularly reliable in seismic crisis, \nwhere seismic activity is highly concentrated both in time and space. Here, this \nanalysis was applied to identify closely related events, re-locate them with JHD \nmethod and compute a composite focal mechanism. The cross-correlation \nfunction is defined by: \n\n( , ?, ) = ? ( + )?( )    (19) \n\nWhere ( ) and ?( ) are two seismic signals while  is the time lag between the \ntwo waveforms. For > 0, ( ) delayed with respect to ?( ) and vice-versa. In \nfact, two waveforms recorded at the same stations and related to events with \nsimilar/coincident locations are expected to have coherent phase picking. \nHowever, even for that particular scenario several aspects can impose \ndiscrepancies between the events picking:   \n\n1. Phase picking is a subjective procedure; \n\n2. Variability in signal to noise ratio; \n\n3. Events magnitude. \n\nA normalised cross-correlation function is often used to reduce the influence of \nthe waveform energy:  \n\n( , ?, ) =  ( , , )\n( , ) ( , )\n\n   (20) \n\nWhere ( , ) and (?, ?) defines the auto-correlation function. \n\nThe cross-correlation is performed by the multicorr application. It cross-\ncorrelates a given set of waveforms based on predefined parameters: the \nnumber of samples to compare, the time window and the correlation limits. \nSeveral indexes are obtained as outputs: compared events identification, cross-\ncorrelation value (1.0 for identical events), time lag of the waveforms and signal \nto noise ratio. The signal to noise ratio is computed by auto-correlating each \nevent waveform in two time windows, one preceding and the other during the \nearthquake. Cross-correlation computation retrieves the average signal to noise \nratio for the compared events. This parameter can be used to evaluate the \nreliability of the identified similarity.

Details on the cross-\ncorrelation and sequence analysis are presented in chapter III.4.2.1. \n\nII.4.3.3.Determining the regional stress tensor  \n\nTo determine the stress tensor based on focal mechanism data, P, B and T \naxes are considered good approximations to the principal stress directions ?1 \n(maximum compression), ?2 and ?3, respectively. This is true for newly formed \nfaults and ideal media without internal friction, where focal mechanism nodal \nplanes match the maximum shear stress planes (Gephart and Forsyth, 1990a). \nHowever, in most geodynamic settings, the reactivation of pre-existing faults \nprevails since the stress needed to form new faults is considerably higher. In \nthese cases, the directions of slip in a single fault (or in a limited number of \nfaults) can diverge substantially from the regional principal maximum stress \ndirections derived by the focal mechanism analysis. The direction of slip should \nbe the one that coincides with the maximum shear stress direction on the fault \nplane. Additionally, the principal stress directions can be identified by \nconsidering the direction of slip in several faults for an area of uniform stress. In \nsuch a case, resulting focal mechanisms solutions are consistent with a limited \nnumber of common stress directions. By combining several observations, a \nrange of matching solutions can be obtained for the local stress field.  \n\nStress limits to pre-existing fault slip  \n\nThe stress acting on a fault plane can be resolved in two components: the \nnormal stress (?N) and the shear stress (?S), perpendicular and parallel to the \nplane, respectively. The ?N inhibits sliding and ?S promote it. In an isotropic \nmedium a new fault will be formed if the applied stress exceeds the rocks \nstrength. However, pre-existent faults have neither tensile nor cohesive \nstrength; as a result failure occurs as long as frictional resistance to slip is \novercome. The frictional resistance to slide is related to the normal stress acting \non the surface, friction is directly proportional to the normal force. Other \ncontrolling factors are inherent to rock type and the fault surface. The \nroughness of the fault surface contradicts sliding, as the movement starts and \npromotes surface smoothness and decrease slide resistance.  \n\nHere, the Focal Mechanism Stress Inversion (FMSI) package from Gephart \n(1990) was used to define the best-fitting regional stress tensor compatible with \nthe majority of observed earthquake focal mechanisms (for detailed aspects of \nthe background theory see Gephart and Forsyth (1984) and Gephart (1990a, \n1990b)). In Gephart and Forsyth (1984), the condition of slip on fault plane is \ndefined according with the following assumptions: there is no shear slip \nperpendicular to the fault (in the direction of ); and the maximum shear stress \n( ) is in the direction of slip: \n\n= ? cos 2    (21) \n\n\n\nII. Data and methods \n\n57 \n \n\n= sin 2    (22) \n\nWhere  is the angle between the fault plane and direction of maximum \ncompression (. ). \n\nThe inversion method \n\nIn the FMSI application the inversion process will find best fitting stress model to \nthe focal mechanism data using a grid search approach and assuming a local \nuniform stress field. It is implicit that both the fault plane (two possibilities exist \nfrom the focal mechanism solution) and stress directions are unknown. \nAccordingly, a primary measure of the inversion model is the misfit between \npredicted and observed data (stress model and fault planes solutions).  \n\nThe resulting stress model comprises the principal stress directions and \nadditional a value R, the Stress Ratio, that is defined as: \n\n= ( )\n( )\n\n   (23) \n\nR gives a measure of the relative magnitude of the stress, because of the \nassumption that ? ? , R is limited between 1 and 0. In the special case \nof hydrostatic stress R=0, in triaxial compressive domains R tends to 1 because \n\n? ? , while in a tensile domain R tends to 0 with ? ? .  \n\nAs mentioned before, the aim of the inversion process is to find the stress and \nR parameters that reduces the discrepancies between the observations and the \npredicted model. The misfit is the smallest rotation about any axis that brings \none of the nodal focal mechanism planes and its slip direction/sense of slip into \nan orientation that is consistent with the stress model (Gephart and Forsyth, \n1984). The discrepancies reflect not only relative rotations between the \nobservations and model solutions but also errors in focal mechanism \ndeterminations and local stress variations (idem). If inconsistency between the \ninverted model and the observations result from stress variation it may be \nnecessary to subdivide the initial dataset into subsets that sustain the \nassumption of uniformity. These subsets may be temporal or spatial limited. A \nfocal mechanism with an inferred fault plane corresponding to a small value of \nshear stress must be considered suspect and can eventually be disregarded \nduring the inversion procedure. \n  \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n58 \n \n\nII.5. RE-processing IAM-GB1 multi-channel reflection profile  \n\nII.5.1.Introduction  \n\nThis subchapter provides an overview of basic concepts of marine multichannel \nreflection profile acquisition and processing. Details of the acquisition of IAM-\nGB1 and of the re-processing parameters are presented Appendix V. Essential \nconcepts on marine multi-channel seismic reflection acquisition system are \npresented first because of their importance for the processing stages.  \n\nThe acquisition system is defined by the source model, the receiver sequence \nand the digital recording system. The source is a controlled artificial generated \nacoustic signal which result from explosions generated using different \nmechanisms: e.g. water steam (steam gun) or compressed air (airgun) \ninjections or high electric pulses (sparker). Synchronized airguns arrays are the \nmore common source for marine multi-channel acquisitions. The use of multiple \nairguns increases source energy and diminish bubble noise that affects data \nquality. The ideal source would produce a very short impulsive wavelet (Figure \nII.13a). However, isolated gas bubbles produced by an airgun oscillate and \ngenerate successive pulses (Figure II.13b) that cause source-induced noise. \nAirgun arrays can cause destructive interference of bubble pulses and alleviate \nthe bubble noise using different volumes and towed at different depths (Figure \nII.13c).  \n\n \nFigure II.13- A schematic example of ideal (a) and typical source-time functions produced by an \nairgun (b) and by an airgun array (c) in a marine experiment. In the airgun signal a series of \nbubble pulses are produced by pressure reverberations within the water which are attenuated \nwith airgun combined array (from Shearer, 2009 and Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). \n\nAnother basic part of the marine acquisition system is the receiver station, \nwhich is most commonly a streamer (Figure II.14). The streamer is a buoyant \nsurface marine cable that comprises an array of hydrophone groups (channels).  \n\nThe hydrophones detect pressure changes induced by seismic waves\u2019 \npropagation following successive explosions generated from different sources \nand which are recovered from different points along the pre-defined profile. This \nanalogue response is subsequently converted to a digital signal (pre-amplified \n\n\n\nII. Data and methods \n\n59 \n \n\nand pre-filtered) by an analogue-digital converter. The seismic signal is a \ncontinuous time function. The conversion into the digital domain (discrete \nrecord) is done using a fixed sample rate, typically between 1 and 4 ms for \nseismic reflection data. During digitalization the seismic signal would loses \nfrequencies that are above a term defined as the Nyquist frequency, \u0192N=(1/2?t), \nWhere ?t is the sampling rate, e.g. a sampling rate of 4ms will lose all the \nfrequencies above 125Hz (Yilmaz, 1993). In fact, frequencies greater the \nNyquist frequency will be converted into low frequencies and undistinguished \nfrom the original seismic signal. This phenomenon is defined frequency aliasing \nand is exemplified in Figure II.15. To avoid this contamination of the digital \nsignal its applied a anti-aliasing filter. Normally, a high-cut filter with the cut-off \nfrequency between \u00be to \u00bd of the Nyquist frequency. \n\n \n\n \nFigure II.14- Marine acquisition system (Adapted from www.bgr.bund.de). \n\n \n\nThe field geometry defined between the airgun array (as well explosion \nfrequency), the streamer, the channel distribution within the streamer and the \nstreamer extension depend on the scientific objectives of the acquisition \ncampaign. The source and receiver spacing define a fundamental acquisition \nparameter: the fold. The marine multi-channel acquisitions operate in multiple \ncover system which consists in a multi-trace response observation (fold) of the \nsame midpoint in a seismic profile, favouring an improved image of subsurface \ngeology in that point: the common midpoint (CMP). Considering a sub-\nhorizontal layered medium, then a common midpoint (CMP) is located at half \ndistance (offset) between the receiver and the shotpoint. The method is \nexemplified in Figure II.16. For example if the shooting interval and receiver \ndistance are both 25m (D in Figure II.16), then the Common Mid-Point (CMP, \nrepresented as P in Figure II.16) distance is 12.5m (half the distance between \nreceivers, D/2 in Figure II.16); the fold is be defined by: \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n60 \n \n\n \n2 \u00d7 ?  \n\n\u00d7 \u00ba  \n\n for a streamer with 96 receivers groups it is 48. So, the same point in the \nseismic profile will be sampled by 48 different channels and imaged by 48 \ntraces. This methodology is central to improve the signal to noise ratio, one of \nthe main purpose of processing steps as discussed in the next subchapter. \n\n \nFigure II.15- Frequency aliasing. On top is an original high frequency signal and in the bottom is \nthe interpolated, based on the sample rate (black dots), low frequency signal.  \n\n \nFigure II.16- Marine multiple cover system: SHOT1-3 define successive shooting positions; Rn, \nR\u2019n, R\u2019\u2019n are receivers at shoting positions S1, S2 and S3, respectively; Pn define covered \npositions in the reflector. D defines both shooting interval and receivers group distance, VW and \nVM are the water and first layer velocities, respectively dushed, full and point-dashed lines are \nray path from source to Pn then reflected to receiver points in the streamer (from \nhttp://walter.kessinger.com/work/seisx_processing.html). \n\nII.5.2.Processing sequence \n\nThe aim of marine seismic reflection data processing is to create an image of \nsubsurface geology. This image results from the interaction between a relatively \nwell- known artificial source with both the water and rock layers, and it is \n\n\n\nII. Data and methods \n\n61 \n \n\nrecorded in arrays of receiver stations. The prime interest resides in the P-wave \nprimary reflections; the remaining energy is considered noise. Noise can be the \nenergy of direct, refracted, diffracted or multiple reflected waves (Figure II.17) \nbut it can also result from sea swell (direct or movement induced in recording \ncable), from the vessel, fish bites or moreover from electrical spikes in the \nrecording system. Increasing signal to noise is one of the main objectives of \nseismic processing steps. All energy in the seismic data departing from the \nsignal of interest are considered as noise. It can be subdivided into coherent \n(e.g. direct, refracted or diffracted waves) and incoherent noise (e.g. instrument \nor cable noise). The coherent noise is consistent from trace to trace while \nincoherent or random noise lack of continuity between adjacent traces. These \ncharacteristics are fundamental to select which processing steps to be used to \nenhance the signal and attenuate the noise. \n\n \nFigure II.17- Illustration of possible energy paths between the source and receivers arrays.  \n\nThere are three fundamental steps in seismic reflection data processing: \ndeconvolution, stacking and migration. However, defining the appropriate \nsequence and processing parameters is a critical task. It depends on several \nfactors such as acquisition parameters (instrumental and external conditions) \nand the study adequacy. In this case, two main objectives were considered \nwhen reprocessing IAM-GB1 profile: firstly, to improve seismic attributes \nobservations in the acoustic basement and secondly to obtain a depth \nconverted profile.  \n\nII.5.2.1.Pre-processing steps \n\nA typical processing sequence starts with some preliminary steps. First, the \ndata acquisition format is identified. The field data are usually time-sequenced \nmeaning that samples from the same time for all channels are packed together. \nThe sample from a time x in the channel 1 is stored next to the same time \nsample from channel 2. However, in seismic processing steps it is convenient to \nhave the data stored by channel. All the time samples from each channel are \nstored together followed by those in the next channels. This process is called \nde-multiplexing. The next pre-processing step engages a preliminary quality \ncheck of the acquired data. Auxiliary channels, noisy traces are deleted and a \nfrequency analysis of the data is made. Accordingly, the dominant spectrum of \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n62 \n \n\nthe recorded signal (and noise) is identified which will help to define which \nprocess and parameters are more adequate to attenuate undesirable noise.  \n\nAnother step applied in the pre-processing stage is a preliminary amplitude \ncorrection to compensate energy lost due to wave propagation in the medium, \nresulting in two main effects:  \n\n1. Absorption resulting from the transformation of the elastic energy in \nheat during medium propagation. It will increase with depth and it will \nwork as high-frequency filter. The correction can be applied based on \ntime and space variant gain. Scattering also attenuates energy but its \neffect is like absorption and very difficult to separate. Both effects are \nconsidered and compensated together. \n\n2. Spherical divergence resulting from the dispersion of energy in \nwavefront, as a function of the increasing distance between the shot \nand the receiver. This energy attenuation it is proportional to 1?   for \na homogenous medium; where r is the radius of the spherical \nwavefront. In a stratified earth, the energy decay is proportional to \nthe velocity in each layer. We can use a preliminary velocity \nestimation of each layer to apply the correction or we can just define \na constant velocity and improve latter on based on more detailed \nvelocity analysis needed for the stacking stage. \n\nFinally, field geometry is taken into account based on the acquisition \nparameters. This step allow to short the data in CMP gathers and should \nprecede any offset depend operation. Defining the correct geometry is \nfundamental for the reliability of remaining processing stages. Using wrong field \nparameters compromises the veracity of the final seismic image. \n\nII.5.2.2.Deconvolution  \n\nThe deconvolution aims at recovering the Earth signature in the seismic trace \nby eliminating the remaining noise and compressing the wavelet. Ideally, the \nseismic trace would only show the recorded earth response impulse (primary \nreflections) resulting from a spike wavelet source. However, the seismic trace \ncomprises primary reflection plus a variety of multiples and noise from several \nsources, coherent and incoherent. Furthermore, the wavelet is not really a \nspike. \n\nThe seismic trace can be defined as the convolution between the source \nwavelet and the earth\u2019s response Yilmaz (2001): \n\n( ) = ( ) ? ( ) + ( ) \n\nWhere ( ) is the seismic record, ( ) is the basic wavelet, ( ) is the Earth\u2019s \nimpulse response, ( ) is the random ambient noise and * denotes convolution. \nThis is defined as convolutional model (see Figure II.18). In theory if we know \n\n\n\nII. Data and methods \n\n63 \n \n\nthe source wavelet form and succeed to eliminate the ambient noise then we \ncould recover earth response.  \n\nIf we could assume that we have low ambient noise than: \n\n( ) = ( ) ? ( ) \n\nThis is the main goal of deconvolution, to design an operator/filter ( ) that: \n\n( ) ? ( ) = ( ) \n\nIf we combine the two last equations we would have: \n\n( ) = ( ) ? ( ) ? ( ) \n\nThan by excluding ( )  \n\n( ) = ( ) ? ( ) \n\nWith ( ) = 1 for t=0 and ( ) = 0 otherwise. \n\n( ) = 1 ? ?( ) \n\nWhere ?( ) is the inverse of the wavelet.  \n\nThe seismic signal can be converted from time domain to frequency domain \nusing forward Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The seismic signal can be define in \nthe frequency domain as a sum of sinusoids, each one with a unique frequency, \namplitude and phase. This is one fundamental base to seismic data analysis \nand seismic processing. The backwards synthesis of all frequency components \ninto time-dependent signal is done using inverse Fourier transforms. Note that \nconvolution is equivalent to multiplication in the frequency domain while addition \nremains the same operation. So in the frequency domain: \n\n( ) =\n1\n( )\n\n \n\nThen the deconvolution operator or filter is the inverse of the wavelet. \n\nThe importance of this operation is that in the frequency domain the wavelet \nand the seismic trace have similar signatures as is shown in Yilmaz (2001, in \nfigure 2.13, here see  \n\nFigure II.18). The same is also true for autocorrelation functions. In fact, wavelet \nand seismic trace autocorrelation functions are equal only where wavelet \nautocorrelation is non-zero (see  \n\nFigure II.18).  \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n64 \n \n\n \nFigure II.18- The convolutional model. In the frequency spectrum and the autocorrelation \nfunctions of the wavelet (b) and the seismic trace (c) are similar (top and middle figures). \nSeismic trace is the convolution of t the earth impulse (a) response with a source wavelet in the \ntime domain (bottom figure, from Yilmaz, 2001). \n\nSo, the fraction that is not similar should represent the impulse response of the \nEarth. This means that the wavelet trace can be found in the seismic record and \nthe earth impulse extracted. This is the key for predictive deconvolution, and \nhas been applied in the IAM-GB1 re-processing workflow.  \n\nII.5.2.3.CMP sorting, velocity analysis and stacking \n\nThe multi-channel seismic profiles acquisition is defined with a multi-fold \ncoverage. As a result a CMP is covered by several traces (Figure II.19A). For \nan homogeneous layer the horizontal reflector defines an hyperbolic curve on a \nCMP gather (Figure II.19B). On the other hand, the direct wave defines a \nstraight line in a two-way time (TWT) versus offset display. In order to increase \nthe signal to noise ratio by stacking (Figure II.19D) the redundant observations \navailable on the CMP gather, the hyperbolic curve must be corrected into a \nhorizontal line (Figure II.19C). This process is the normal moveout (NMO) \ncorrection and is defined as follows (Yilmaz, 1993):  \n\n? = ( ) ? (0) = (0) + ? (0) \n\nWhere ( ) is the time between the shot-point, CMP and receiver while (0) is \nthe time if the shot-point location was coincident with the receiver and the CMP \nwas just below, at a point in a perpendicular line (Figure II.19a). For a \nhomogeneous layer NMOv is identical to the media seismic velocity. For a layered \nmedia with horizontal interfaces the travel-time curve of reflections is still \n\n\n\nII. Data and methods \n\n65 \n \n\napproximately hyperbolic and the NMO correction is still valid. For horizontal \nlayering the CMP coincides with the CDP (Common Depth Point). \n\nNote that if we consider that the reflector is not horizontal the CMP and CDP will \nbe different (in fact there is no more a CDP) and the NMO correction is given \nby: \n\n? = (0) +\n?\n\n? (0) \n\nWhere ?is the apparent dip of the reflector (or the dip at the seismic section). \n\nIn a horizontally stratified medium, the travel time equation for a path between a \nsource, a CMP at depth D and a receiver is (from Yilmaz, 1993):  \n\n( ) = + \u2026 +  \n\nWith = (0), = 1?  and  is a complex function that depends on \nlayers velocity and thickness, where  is the velocity down at depth of the \nreflector D: \n\n=\n1\n(0)\n\n? (0) \n\nWhere  is the interval velocity of the   layer. According to Yilmaz (1993) the \ntravel time expression can be simplified if a small-spread approximation is \nconsidered, i.e. if the offset is smaller than the depth, then: \n\n( ) = (0) +  \n\nFor a horizontal layering   is equal to , the same assumption is applied \nfor gentle dipping reflectors. \n\nAccording to the above-described, three fundamental aspects control the NMO \ncorrection: the seismic velocity of the medium along the ray path, the shot-\nreceiver distance and the reflectors depth. Hence, velocity analysis is an \nessential processing step that we will sum up next. \n\n \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n66 \n \n\n \nFigure II.19- Common Midpoint (A), common midpoint gather(B), NMO (C) and stacking (D) \n(adapted from http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Terms/c/common_midpoint.aspx). \n\nThe velocity analysis is an interactive processing procedure that enables an \ninterpretation of the NMO (stacking) velocities. It can be done using different \nmethods. However, here only the semblance analysis is shown (Figure II.20). \nThe semblance measures the similarity between adjacent traces by evaluating \nits fit into a possible hyperbolic trajectory. The result is TWT vs velocity display \nwith a similitude scale (see left display in Figure II.20). The interpreter selects \nthe velocities with maximum semblance and simultaneously examines the result \nin: \n\n1. CMP gather to verify the NMO correction of the reflectors (see centre \ndisplay in Figure II.20); \n\n2. In preliminary stack to assure the reflectors lateral coherency (see \nright display in Figure II.20).     \n\nThese plots allow the interpreter to improve the NMO correction by correcting \nthe stacking velocities to assure the horizontality of the reflectors. The final \nvelocity model is used to generate the stacked section. \n\n\n\nII.

Figure II.21 shows a schematic representation of the migration \nprinciples (from Yilmaz, 2001). The true geometry of geological feature that \ngenerates reflector CD is represented in a depth-distance profile (see Figure \nII.21a). In a zero-offset (or stacking) time section, vertical incidence of the ray \ngenerated at the reflector CD is assumed and recorded at the receivers AB. As \na result the original reflector CD, dipping ? is placed at position in C\u2019D\u2019, dipping \n?. Migration should position the C\u2019D\u2019 into a position/geometry closer to CD. The \nquantitative analysis of this migration process is described in Figure II.22 (from \nYilmaz, 2001). The relations between horizontal and vertical displacements on \nthe migrated and unmigrated sections are defined by the following formulas \n(see definitions in Figure II.22). \n\n=\n?\n\n4?\n \n\n= 1 ? 1 ?\n?t\n\n2?\n   \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n68 \n \n\n?\n?\n\n=\n?\n?\n\n \n1\n\n1 ? ?2?\n\n \n\nSeveral observations are made by Yilmaz (2001) based on the described \nequations and Figure II.22: \n\nThe time dip at migrated sections are always greater than in stacking sections, \ni.e. ?\n\n?\n> ?\n\n?\n, or migration steepens reflectors; \n\nIn event E, the horizontal displacement ?  increases with time t; \n\nBoth horizontal and vertical displacements are dependent of the velocity \nselected for migration; \n\nThe steeper events imply higher horizontal and vertical displacement in \nmigrated sections. \n\nTime migration is an essential processing step to position observed seismic \nfeatures closer to the geological reality. Several techniques are used for \nmigration but all are based on the assumptions that:  \n\n1.Seismic section shows just primary reflections and diffractions; \n\n2.The interval velocities along the ray-paths are known. Dix formulation \nis used to convert rms velocities into interval velocities: \n\n=\n?\n?\n\n \n\nWhere  is the rms velocity and  is the zero-offset arrival time corresponding \nto nth reflector (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). \n\nIn practice, migration aims at solving the angle of incidence ? (see Figure II.22) \nand track the ray path backwards to the reflecting point. The \u201cHuygens\u2019 \nprinciple\u201d is assumed, in which every point on a wavefront can be regarded as a \nnew source. Each reflector is therefore seen as covered with point sources, all \nexploding at t=0 (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). How this process is achieved \nallows distinguishing the different migration methods: e.g. Kirchhoff; finite-\ndifference or frequency-wavenumber migrations. \n\nA finite-difference method is used to reprocess the IAM GB1 MCS profile. This \nmethod allows to migrate dips up to 60\u00b0, produces less migration noise, is \neffective in low signal to noise areas and can accommodate lateral velocity \nvariation (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995).  \n\n\n\nII. Data and methods \n\n69 \n \n\n \nFigure II.21- Migration principles. a) Shows the true geometry of the reflector CD in a depth \nsection, B) shows the same reflector in a stacking section (C\u2019D\u2019) and the migrated back into \nposition CD. It is clear that in the stacking section the reflector is less steep, deeper and longer \nthan the original geological feature (image from Yilmaz, 2001). \n\n \nFigure II.22- Schematic representation of horizontal and vertical displacement in migrated \nsections. Note that reflector CD, in the unmigrated section, is moved to the C\u2019D\u2019 position after \nmigration. Event E and E\u2019 on the unmigrated and migrated section, respectively are used as \nreference for the amount of horizontal and vertical displacement (dt and dx).  \n\nThe time migrated profile can be adjusted according to a vertical velocity \nfunction to obtain a linear in depth section. This depth conversion process \ndiffers from depth migration, which implies solving ray path in areas of high \nlateral velocity contrasts. Depth conversion is the process selected to obtain \nIAM-GB1 MCS profile in depth. What we obtained is a stretched version of the \ndepth migrated profile, this approximation is particularly important in this work \nbecause it is helpful to relate geological structures with seismic activity. We \nselected this method because although this seismic section is located in the \ntransition between different geodynamic domains, lateral velocity gradients are \nlow as we will further discuss in chapter IV (and Appendix V).  \n\nII.6. Principles of seismic interpretation \n\nRocks are distinguished in seismology by seismic velocity and density. The \nproduct between density and velocity is the seismic impedance. The primary \nreflections recorded in the seismic trace result from seismic impedance \ncontrasts that follow grossly the lithological bending or unconformities. As a \nresult the primary reflectors have chronostratigraphic significance. It is worth \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n70 \n \n\nnoticing that lateral facies transitions are too gradual to have any imprint at the \nseismic trace. These basic principles allow the correlation of reflectors of \ndifferent areas and the link of the seismic signal with geological record.  \n\nFollowing the same principles, Mitchum et al., (1977) applied the stratigraphic \nconcept of depositional sequence to the interpretation of seismic sections. A \ndepositional sequence is \u201ca stratigraphic unit composed of unconformable \nsuccession of genetically related strata and bounded at its top and base by \nunconformities or their correlated conformities\u201d. This definition is the bases of \nseismic stratigraphy and instructs the seismic interpretation as the study of the \ngeometric pattern within a depositional sequence and of the surfaces separating \nit. The limiting boundaries can be: \n\n? A hiatus defined by the nonexistence of an interval in geological record;  \n\n? An unconformity that is an erosional or a non-depositional surface and it \nmarks a hiatus ; \n\n? A conformity which separates sequences from different ages without \nevidences for a hiatus between it.  \n\nThe concept is illustrated at Figure II.23.  Seismic sequence is the depositional \nsequence in a seismic section and is subdivided in seismic units (numbers in \nFigure II.23). Seismic facies are the defining features that allow us to \ndiscriminate different seismic units. The essential parameters are summed up in \nFigure II.24 \n\n \n\n \nFigure II.23- Basic concepts of depositional sequence (from Roque, 2007 and references \ntherein).

It is \nsubdivided in four sections. In the first section III.2, we describe pre-processing \nsteps and preliminary results. We start by evaluating events detection and \ncompare it with permanent land network data for the acquisition period. Next we \ndescribe the phase identification in LOBSTER OBS, GEOSTAR and land \nstations and local magnitudes estimation only from the OBS data. Finally, we \npresent a preliminary earthquake location. \n\nIn the section III.3, we show the results on improving earthquakes location by \napplying Joint hypocenter determination, simultaneous inversion for hypocenter-\nvelocity model and double-difference techniques. Fault-plane solutions and \ntensor analysis are described in section III.5 and III.6, respectively. In the last \nsection we sum up and discuss the final results. \n\nIII.1. Pre-processing and preliminary results \n\nIII.1.1.Event detection and extraction \n\nSince the NEAREST network acquired the passive seismic data in continuous, \nwe tested two methods for earthquakes detection: spectrogram analysis and \nautomatic trigger algorithm (details on both methods in chapter II).  \n\nThe spectrogram image was created by using a routine package in FORTRAN \ncode provided by Lu\u00eds Matias. We started off by converting the originally \nwaveform in seed format to ASCII using rdseedasc routine. In the next step, we \nused len2bmp application to generate spectrograms bitmaps (Figure III.1). This \napplication uses an input file len2bmp.in with several user defined parameters \n(Figure III.2): the number of stations to output (nsta), the number sample points \nto compute the spectra (n_spectra); the instrument sample rate (sranom), the \nnumber of spectral frequencies to output (nfj), the number of frequencies to be \naveraged (n_sum), the time shift between spectra in s and the attenuation \nfactor. Detected events were then extracted from each station waveform files (in \nseed format) using rdmultiseed routine and merged in events waveform files \nusing seisei application (from SEISAN 9.0.1 package, Havskov and Ottem\u00f6ller, \n2011).  \n\nThe second method uses an automatic REF-TEK trigger algorithm, STA/LTA \n(short time average/long time average). In this process, earthquakes are \nidentified because absolute amplitude variations during these events are \nresolved from the background seismic noise. The effectiveness of this method \ndepends mainly on trigger algorithm sensitivity and accuracy, determined by the \nadequacy of the selected trigger parameters (details in Table III.1Table III.2). \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n74 \n \n\nWe only considered events that were identified simultaneously in more than 4 \nstations. An example is presented in Figure III.3 and Figure III.4. \n\n \n\n \nFigure III.1- A spectrogram for an event from January 12, 2008 21:21 detected in 22 LOBSTER \nOBS vertical component (OBS06 and OBS11 vertical were not acquiring). The horizontal linear \ndisturbance marks the event allowing the observer to visually identify an earthquake. \nAfterwards, event detection is checked in respective seismograms. \n\n \nFigure III.2- An example of the len2bmp input file with defined parameters used to generate \nspectrograms bitmaps. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nIII.

Most events restricted \nto spectrograms had low quality or could not be seen in the seismogram (false \nevents). In this context, assuming that automatic REF-TEK trigger algorithm is a \nfaster method, triggering it was the method chosen to extract events from the \ncontinuous data set. \n\n \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n76 \n \n\n \nFigure III.4- Details on OBS18-OBS16 Z-component seismogram for January 12, 2008 21:21 \nevent. Both stations show amplitude changes in during the event indentified in seismic \nspectrogram (fig.III.1). However the seismic event can only be clearly picked at OBS18 \nseismogram. \n\n \n\nAfter running the triggering algorithm 1641 events were identified, 1322 of which \nwere earthquakes (corresponding to 19% of false positives). To this dataset 32 \nevents were added, detected only using spectrogram analysis (or detected by \nchance), producing a total 1354 events. \n\nA quality control of the events was made using the categories defined in the \nTable III.3. As a result we obtained 52 events of best quality, 154 of high, 561 of \nmedium and 587 of low. This means that 767 or 57% of the all events should be \nlocated. During the NEAREST network acquisition period, 422 earthquakes \nwere recorded in landstations (data provided by Fernando Carrilho from IPMA-\nInstituto Portugu\u00eas do Mar e da Atmosfera, former IM-Instituto de Metereologia, \nin NEAREST 2008 Cruise Preliminary Report) for the NEAREST network \nregion. This means that the NEAREST Network added 345 to the events \ncatalogue in the study area, i.e. these were not detected by the IPMA land \nstations. In contrast, only 58 events were undetected by the NEAREST OBS \nand reported in the land Network catalogue. Those events were located at NE \nof the NEAREST network, near the Algarve coast. In the Figure III.5 we plotted \nLand Network events located to a maximum of 75 km of the closest OBS station \nthe region inside the black ellipse marks events not detected or poorly seen by \nNEAREST temporary network.  \n\n \n\n\n\nIII.

The seismic events within the black ellipse area were detected by \nland network and not visible by NEARE ST OBS stations (data provided by Fernando Carrilho \nfrom IPMA in NEAREST 2008 Cruise Preliminary Report; bathymetry from GEBCO- General \nBathymetric Chart of the Oceans).   \n\n \n\nIII.1.2.Phase identification and preliminary location  \n\nThe seismic data analysis was carried out using SEISAN 9.0.1 Seismic Analysis \npackage (Havskov and Ottem\u00f6ller, 2011). For general plotting and signal \nanalysis it was used the MULPLT program integrated in this package. All the \nevents were manually picked for P and S waves\u2019 first arrivals, generally in the \nthree components seismometer and in unfiltered signal (Figure III.6 and Figure \nIII.7). When necessary band-pass filters were applied to improve signal to noise \nratio and allow phases identification. One way band\u2013pass filter with low-cut of \n4Hz and high-cut of 25 Hz were applied to identify p-wave first arrival (Figure \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n78 \n \n\nIII.8) and with low-cut of 2 Hz and high-cut of 4Hz for s-wave picking (Figure \nIII.9).  \n\n \nFigure III.6- Event recorded in GEOSTAR and OBS09 vertical component (no filter applied). \n\n \n\n \nFigure III.7- Event recorded in GEOSTAR, OBS06 and OBS19 horizontal components (no filter \napplied). \n\nP-wave first arrival polarities were read in unfiltered signal. In Figure III.10, we \nillustrate how misleading can be the use of filter signal to determine P-wave \npolarities. In this example we see that in unfiltered signal the P-wave first \nmotion is up and in filter signal the polarity is reversed. To determine local \nmagnitudes (ML), we picked the maximum amplitude of the seismic events in \nWood-Anderson seismogram of LOBSTER stations\u2019 horizontal components \n(Figure III.11). \n\nThe hydrophone record was used only as alternative for P wave picking (with \nhigh-pass 1Hz filter when required \u2013Figure III.12) and polarity confirmations. In \nFigure III.12 is shown an example of hydrophone signal (note that polarities are \n\n\n\nIII. NEAREST OBS experiment \n \n\n79 \n \n\nreversed). P-wave first arrival and polarity were picked on land stations signals \nexclusively to constrain focal mechanism solutions (Figure III.13).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure III.8- Seismic event recorded in OBS14 vertical component (on top without filtering and \nthe lower with band-pass filter of 4-25Hz). \n\n \n\n \nFigure III.9- Event recorded LOBSTER stations 13 horizontal component (on top without \nfiltering and the lower with band-pass filter 2-4Hz). \n\n \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n80 \n \n\n \nFigure III.10- Polarity picked in unfiltered (top) and filtered seismogram (bottom). We can \nrecognize that using band pass-filter 4-25 Hz when picking for P-wave polarity can lead to \nwrong measurements. In unfiltered signal the P-wave polarity is clearly up and in filter is down. \n\n \n\n \nFigure III.11- Measurement of maximum amplitude in Wood-Anderson seismogram to compute \nthe local magnitude. \n\n \nFigure III.12- Event recorded in the hydrophone of the LOBSTER station 19 (high-pass filter \n1Hz). \n\n \n\n\n\nIII. NEAREST OBS experiment \n \n\n81 \n \n\n \nFigure III.13- Event recorded in land station MESJ on the vertical component (no filter). \n\nDifferential weighting was applied to all phases pickings based on reading \nuncertainty. A clear identification of first arrival was classified with weight 0 and \npoorly identified phase with weight 4. This weighting scheme is a fundamental \npre-processing step to improve events locations solutions. It will define the \nrelative quality of arrival time readings when computing earthquakes locations. \nAll land stations picks were attributed with weight 4 to be excluded from \nearthquakes locations process. Including land stations locations would imply \nadapting the velocity model to include continental lithosphere variability. This \nprocessing step was not included in this work. \n\nA total of 794 seismic events were analysed, 746 of which in more than 3 \nstations. A total of 11901 phase picking, 4739 P-wave and 7612 S-wave first \narrivals. For most stations the number of S-picking was larger than P-picking. In \nfact, some of the recorded events consisted exclusively by, or we could only \nrecognize, S-wave arrivals (see appendix I for stations detections details). Apart \nfrom local earthquakes, teleseismic and regional were identified. These events \nwere excluded from this work because we were only concerned with the local \nseismicity. In Figure III.14 is an example of a local earthquake recorded both in \nNEAREST and Land networks.  \n\nPreliminary earthquake location and local magnitude estimation was performed \nusing the HYPOCENTER application from SEISAN 9.1 package (Havskov and \nOttem\u00f6ller, 2011). This application is a modified version of an early \nhomonymous application (Lienert et al., 1986, Lienert, 1991, Lienert and \nHavskov, 1995). The HYPOCENTER uses as input the first arrival phases (P \nand S) and a layered velocity model to determine earthquake location. When \nabsolute time in a station is not well constrained it can use relative arrival time \ndifferences (S-P). Detailed description of the location method is presented in \nLienert et al. (1986). The interpreter must predefine several input values in a \nparameter file, STATION0.HYP. This file will also contain fundamental location \nparameters: station details and velocity model. \n\nThe velocity model used for preliminary locations was defined in the NEAREST \n2008 Cruise Report R/V Urania. We excluded the velocity model used by IPMA \n(see Figure III.15) for locations based on the permanent network because it is \ndefined exclusively for the continental lithospheric domains whereas Gulf of \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n82 \n \n\nCadiz lithospheric domains are more complex (see elsewhere in this work). It \nwas based on the velocity models inferred from wide-angle reflection (See \nSIS16 in Figure III.14) and refraction seismic profiles in Gutscher et al. (2002) \nand combining results from multichannel seismic reflection profile (IAM-03 in \nFigure III.14) with wide-angle land station records and gravity modelling in \nGonzalez et al. (1996). We defined this model as MOD0 (see details in Figure \nIII.15). The model is described for P-wave velocities only, the S-wave travel \ntimes are computed based on a Vp/Vs ratio of 1.75. The first 2 layers on MOD0 \nrepresent upper and lower sediments. The crust is subdivided in two layers \n(upper and lower crust) and the Moho is at 16km in depth. We exclude water \nvelocity from the model MOD0 because NEAREST Network stations are \ncoupled to the sea floor, so ray paths will not cross the water column. \n\nFor local magnitude (ML) estimation it was used Carrilho and Vales (2009) \nformulation for Portugal and adjacent areas: \n\n=  + 1.287  +  0.00061 ?  2.147 \n\nA is the amplitude measured in a Wood- Anderson synthetic display (in nm) and \n? is the hypocentral distance (in km). \n\nP and S phase consistence was tested using Wadati diagram. In this diagram, \nS-P times plot against absolute P-time should define a straight line. Phase \noutliers can easily be identified because will misfit this linear tendency (Figure \nIII.16). Outliers can result both from error on the first arrival picking or \nmisinterpretation of phases. So, misfit phase pickings were re-checked and re-\ntested in Wadati diagram. If required phase weight was adapted. \n\nThe focal depth for each event was established using a systematic search \napproach with application RMSDEP (Figure III.16) from SEISAN 9.1 (Havskov \nand Ottem\u00f6ller, 2011). The RMSDEP routine uses, for a starting depth solution \n(if no initial location is provided), a value included in STATION0.HYP. To ensure \nthat the final solution is not controlled by the user defined initial depths, we \ntested different input values. Finally, we assumed that the best solution was the \none that best fits the data, retrieving the lowest RMS.  \n\nIn Figure III.17, we present a preliminary earthquake location for the events \nacquired by NEAREST network using the method just described. The average \nrms of the time residuals for all 746 events analysed was 0.8s. From those, 590 \nevents are located in the restricted area of the NEAREST network as defined by \nexternal envelope of the stations locations. The remaining events are distributed \noutside this area. The seismicity is concentrated between 30 and 60 km in \ndepth and local magnitude estimation ranges from 0.9 to 4.8. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nIII.

In RMSDEP (right) graphic, we can define \nthe best depth location for each event by selecting the solution with the lowest rms. \n\n \n\n\n\nIII. NEAREST OBS experiment \n \n\n85 \n \n\nWithin the NEAREST network area, earthquakes are clearly distributed in three \nclusters:  \n1. In the S. Vicente Canyon, where most of the seismicity is concentrated in \n\na NE-SW alignment; \n2. In the Gorringe Bank, where earthquakes have an asymmetric \n\ndistribution, clustering in the SW part of this submarine mountain \n(Gettysburg high); \n\n3. In the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain, where seismicity defines an NW-SE \nelongate alignment. \n\nIn the adjacent region, the seismicity is more diffuse with only a few events \nlocated in the area of the Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge and to the North of \nthis structure. A detailed description and discussion of the seismicity in the \ndeployment area will be presented in section III.4 after improving earthquake \nlocation. We will also compare the results with the locations provided by Land \npermanent network.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure III.17- Earthquakes preliminary location using NEAREST report velocity model: 746 \nevents located by the NEAREST OBS network with ML between 0.9 to 4.8 and an average rms \nof 0.8. (The black arrows mark the location of W-E and N-S profiles, bathymetry from GEBCO. \nAbbreviations: GB-Gorringe Bank, SVC- S\u00e3o Vicente Canyon, HAP-Horseshoe Abyssal Plain \nand AW- Accretionary Wedge). \n\n \n\nGB \nSVC \n\nHAP \n\nAW \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n86 \n \n\nStations statistics were also scrutinized (see Appendix I for details). In Figure \nIII.18, we plotted a preliminary events location versus events detected in each \nstation. The stations with higher number of records are OBS 08, 17, 05 and 06. \nExcept for OBS06, the remaining 3 equipments worked without x component \nduring the operation. Both OBS 06 and 08 operated during the entire campaign. \nAll stations are positioned near the identified clusters, OBS06 near the S\u00e3o \nVicente Cluster, where most events are located; OBS05 as well as OBS08 are \nnear the Gorringe Bank and the OBS17 in the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain cluster. \n\nThe stations with the worst statistics are OBS15, OBS16 and OBS21. The OBS \n15 operated just for 7 month and stopped because the disk was full. Both \nOBS16 and 21 stopped for the same reason but recorded during 11 months. \nThree reasons can explain the poor events recovery as follows. Firstly, these \nstations are located in limit of deployment area and far from areas with higher \nseismic activity. Secondly, the three OBS were deployed on top of the Gulf of \nCadiz accretionary wedge (seismic chaotic units in Figure III.19). This structure \nis characterized by high internal deformation and anisotropy which favour \nseismic energy dissipation during seismic waves propagation, resulting in poor \nrecovery of the first arrivals. The S-waves signal could also be disturbed by the \npresence of fluids. Thirdly, OBS16 and OBS15 are located in the area of \nMediterranean Outflow Water circulation that may introduce increasing \nbackground noise and disturb station-seafloor coupling. \n\n\n\nIII. NEAREST OBS experiment \n \n\n87 \n \n\n \nFigure III.18- Events location versus events detected in each station. Red circles are epicenters and the rectangular bar at each station express the number \nevents detected, the highest bar is equivalent to 555 events (OBS08) and lowest represents 60 earthquakes (OBS15). The stations with the worst statistics \nare OBS15, OBS16 and OBS21. Several reasons explain this statistic: stations operation details, stations proximity to predominant seismically active zones, \nstation-seafloor coupling conditions controlled by the presence of the Gulf of Cadiz accretionary wedge and/or Mediterranean Outflow Water circulation \n(bathymetry compilation from Zitellini et al., 2009).  \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate boundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n88 \n \n\n \nFigure III.19- Stations distribution versus the thickness of seismic chaotic units. One of the reasons that may lead for poor seismic records in some of the \nOBS is the presence of the Gulf of Cadiz accretionary wedge at the stations base. This structure is characterized by high internal deformation and anisotropy \nwhich favour seismic energy dissipation during seismic waves propagation, resulting in poor recovery of the first arrivals. The s-waves signal could also \ndisturbed by the presence of fluids (bathymetry compilation from Zitellini et al., 2009). \n\n\n\nIII. NEAREST OBS experiment \n \n\n89 \n \n\nIII.2. Improving earthquake location \n\nIII.2.1.Joint Hypocenter Determination (JHD) \n\nFrom the 746 located events based on the Nearest OBS experiment we \nselected a subset of 443 events restricted to the deployment area, i.e. within the \nexternal envelope of the station locations in the SW Portuguese margin that \nwere identified in more than 6 stations. The initial average time residual for this \nselection was 0.76s. To improve earthquake location we began by applying a \nJoint Hypocenter Determination (JHD) method using HYPOCENTER from \nSEISAN 9.1 package (Havskov and Ottem\u00f6ller, 2011) and PRN2RES \n(application created by Luis Matias to include independent P\u2013wave corrections). \nThis method retrieves stations corrections to account for 3D propagation effects \nand geological variability below each station (details on the method in chapter \nII). We used MOD0 velocity model to compute earthquake location but tested \ndifferent Vp/Vs ratios. \n\nAfter applying the JHD method we reduced the average time residual to 0.415s \nand find the best Vp/Vs between 1.77-1.78 (Figure III.20). The Vp/Vs is higher \nthan the one used in preliminary location. We also ran the Wadati application to \nfind the average Vp/Vs ratio for the all events selection and results point out to a \nsmaller value-1.72. To compare results from both methods we applied a \nmodified version of Wadati routine, the Wadati_sp (created by Luis Matias) \nadapted to extract S-wave and P-wave first arrivals time (Ts and Tp, \nrespectively). The results and a linear tendency analysis are plotted in Figure \nIII.20.  \n\nFrom Figure III.20, we observe Vp/Vs retrieved from JHD fits the slope of a \nlinear tendency crossing the axis origin in a Ts-Tp plot while Wadati computed \nVp/Vs ratio defines the slope of a general linear tendency. Final results \ndiscrepancies outcomes from different approaches to find Vp/Vs. JHD method \nfinds the best fitting fixed Vp/Vs to all events locations while Wadati value \nresults from the average of individual events computations (excluding any \nVp/Vs value superior to 1.93 and lower than 1.54). \n\nHowever, in marine deployment, which is the case of NEAREST network, the \npresence of top high porosity and water content marine sediments decrease S-\nvelocity, increasing Vp/Vs ratio (e.g. Crawford and Singh, 2008). Also, we know, \nfrom refraction and multichannel reflection profiles, that half of the seismic \nnetwork is located above large scale chaotic sequences (Horseshoe \nGravitational Unit and the Gulf of Cadiz Imbricated Wedge, Table III.4 and \nFigure III.19) which can also decrease seismic velocities. Additionally, we have \nevidences for fluid circulation within the Gulf of Cadiz Imbricated Wedge \ntestified by mud volcanoes activity (e.g. Pinheiro et al, 2003, Hensen et al., \n2015, among other). This process will also decrease particularly S-wave \nvelocity. So, we would expect to have higher Vp/Vs ratios. This is evidenced \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n90 \n \n\nwith JHD approach because it results from fitting individual Vp/Vs calculations \nto a Ts \u2013Tp plot but attenuated when computing average Vp/Vs (excluding \nhigher Vp/vs ratios), which is the case of the Wadati application. \n\n \nTable III.4-Sediment cover below NEAREST network stations (based on multichannel seismic \nreflections profiles interpretation). \n\nStation \nTWT sediment \ncover isopach \n\n(ms) \n\nTWT Chaotic \nsequence \n\nisopach (ms) \nStation \n\nTWT sediment \ncover isopach \n\n(ms) \n\nTWT Chaotic \nsequence \n\nisopach (ms) \n\nOBS01 1490 \n \n\nOBS14 3256 1852 \n\nOBS02 1713 \n \n\nOBS15 2358 974 \n\nOBS03 2331 \n \n\nOBS16 3042 1709 \n\nOBS04 1752 \n \n\nOBS17 2252 866 \n\nOBS05 1865 \n \n\nOBS18 763 181 \n\nOBS06 1675 \n \n\nOBS19 3664 1207 \n\nOBS08 1862 221 OBS20 3517 2472 \n\nOBS09 2913. 776 OBS21 3189 2334 \n\nOBS10 2314 \n \n\nOBS22 1150 \n \n\nOBS11 2309 661 OBS23 3466 1186 \n\nOBS12 2587 1454 OBS24 1296 \n \n\nOBS13 2631 1592 OBS25 2186 \n \n\n   GEOSTAR 2518  \n\nIn Figure III.21, we plotted P-wave stations delays derived from JHD method. \nThis corrections result from the difference between calculated arrival time, \nbased on the P-velocity model and the picked first arrival. It should reflect local \nvelocity deviations (or geological variability) from the general velocity model-\nMOD0. However, if we compare stations corrections with values of sediment \nthickness in Table III.4 no clear dependence is established, except that highest \npositive delays (or slower local velocities) are correlated with high sediment \nthickness. \n\n\n\nIII. NEAREST OBS experiment \n \n\n91 \n \n\n \nFigure III.20- On top table with RMS versus Vp/Vs. At the bottom S-arrival against P-arrival \ntimes and linear tendency approximation (data extracted using Wadati_sp routine, black \ntendency line is a general fit while red linear tendency is forced to cross axis origin. Both \ndefining equations for general fit, on top, and crossing origin axis, on bottom, are also \npresented). \n\n \nFigure III.21- P-wave stations delays derived from JHD method (blue is positive delay, meaning \nthat arrival times in these stations reveal local slower P-velocities when compared with velocity \nmodel -MOD0; red is negative delay, reflecting local faster P-velocities). There is no clear \ndependence between stations corrections and sediment thickness in table III.4, except that \nhighest positive delays (or slower local velocities) are correlated with high sediment thickness \n(bathymetry from GEBCO). \n\nBased on the arguments discussed before, we conclude that introducing \nindependent S-wave stations delays in the JHD method should be more \nadequate to our case study. We used HYP2 (routine modified Luis Matias to \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n92 \n \n\ninclude S independent delays) and PRN2RES2 applications to improve \nlocations, also testing different Vp/Vs. The HYP2 routine defines S-delays as \nadditional corrections to be added to the ones computed from P-delays and \nVp/Vs.  \n\nWith JHD method (including independent P and S stations corrections) we \nreduced the average RMS for earthquake location to 0.320s. The best fitting \nVp/vs is 1.72 (see Figure III.22), equal to the one computed with Wadati routine. \nOnce more we plotted Ts against Tp extracted with Wadati_sp application \n(Figure III.22).

To introduce this issue we repeated \nthe location procedure using different 1D velocities models extracted from \nSallar\u00e8s et al. (2011) and Sallar\u00e8s et al. (2013) NEAREST refraction and wide-\nangle reflection seismic profile P2 and P1, respectively, located within the area \nof NEAREST Network (Figure III.26).  \n\nSallar\u00e8s et al. (2011) divides profile P2 in three domains: oceanic, transitional \nand continental. Our 1D velocity models were extracted exclusively from the \nfirst sector, assuming that most of the NEAREST OBS stations are located on \nthe oceanic crust domain. This domain is characterized by (Sallar\u00e8s et al., \n2011): top sediments (comprising Gulf of Cadiz Imbricated Wedge and a thin \nlayer of cover sediments) with lower velocities, ranging from 1.8km/s at top and \n3.0 km/s at the base. Underlying these units are higher velocity sediments, vary \nfrom 2.8 km/s and 4.0 km/s. Crustal velocities below sediments cover vary from \n4.6\u20134.8 km/s at the top to 6.9\u20137.1 km/s at the base. Upper mantle velocities are \nlow, between 7.6 and .8 km/s, pointing out for some degree of serpentinization \n(Sallar\u00e8s et al., 2011).  \n\nA total of 3 continuous p-wave velocities models were extracted (see Figure \nIII.27A and C) and subsequently converted to average interval velocities profiles \nto be used in HYPOCENTER. Velocity intervals were defined in agreement with \ndescription presented in Sallar\u00e8s et al. (2011) meaning that distinct velocity \nlayers and sub-layers were respected, to a limit of the available data, roughly 20 \nkm depth. All velocity models were then extrapolated to approximately 80 km \ndepth.  \n\nMod_P1 was provided by Sara Martinez (pers. communication) and extracted in \nan area coincident to Horseshoe cluster (see Figure III.26 for location). Sallar\u00e8s \net al. (2013) description of the P1 profile for the area of the Horseshoe Abyssal \nPlain (where extracted Mod_P1 is located) refers to: a sequence of Mesozoic \nand Cenozoic sediments overlaying directly on serpentinized mantle. The \ntransition is marked by strong velocity gradient, increasing from 4km/s to \n7.2km/s, in 3km (see Figure III.27B-C). \n\nWe recalculated earthquakes locations applying the JHD method with \nindependent P and S stations delays, testing different velocity models and \nVp/Vs ratios (between 1.68 and 1.79). After 7 iterations steps, the best fitting \nmodel was mod_70 extracted from P2 refraction profile with Vp/Vs of 1.71 and \nRMS of 0.317 (see Table III.5). Both mod100 and mod120 had reached similar \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n96 \n \n\nfinal RMS. The model extracted from NEAREST P1 profile shown the higher \nVs/Vs ?1.78 and the largest RMS?0.358. \n\nP and S waves' stations delays, resulting from JHD method with velocity \nmod70, are plotted in Figure III.28 and Figure III.29. For P-wave stations \ncorrections no clear relation with subsurface geology is established and once \nmore GSTAR had the largest negative delay. However, S-wave stations delays \nstill all positive reflecting the effect of the shallower sedimentary layer.  \n\nFinal earthquake locations in the deployment area, using JHD method with \nmod70, are plotted in Figure III.30. As in the previous locations, we can identify \nthree seismicity clusters: Gorringe Bank cluster, Horseshoe Abyssal Plain \ncluster and S\u00e3o Vicente Canyon cluster. Both in N-S and W-E profiles, we \nobserve that most hypocenters are located between 20 and 50 km deep. \nShallower events are located outside these clusters, mostly to the North of the \nAccretionary Wedge. Within the clusters area, earthquakes depth increases \nfrom West to East, from the Gorringe cluster to Horseshoe and S\u00e3o Vicente \nclusters. \n\n\n\nIII.

Three clusters of seismicity are \nidentified in the Gorringe Bank, the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain and the S\u00e3o Vicente Canyon \ncluster. \n\nIII.2.2.Determine 1D minimum velocity model \n\nThe arrival time of a seismic wave is a function of both hypocenter location and \nthe propagation velocities along the ray path between the focus and the \nrecording stations. This dependence is referred as the coupled hypocenter-\nvelocity problem. For JHD methods the velocity model is fixed and the \nearthquake locations are improved by changes in the hypocenter parameters \nand stations corrections. In the previous section we showed that this approach \nhelped to improve earthquakes locations. However, we were able to test only a \nlimited range of 1D velocity models variability. In the area of the NEAREST \nOBS network deployment, the crustal structure is variable and so the \nsimultaneous inversion for hypocenters and 1D velocity model seems more \nadequate. \n\nWe used the VELEST algorithm, for simultaneous inversion of hypocenter \nlocation, stations corrections and 1D velocity model for P and S waves (details \non the method in Kissiling, 1988). As before, stations corrections will account for \nparticularly subsurface geological variability below the recording stations and \nadditional 1D model complexity can be introduced by consider Vp/Vs ratio \nvariable layer by layer. \n\nThe VELEST method is a trial and error process, starting with a priori 1D \nvelocity models (based on previous seismological studies, seismic reflection \nand refraction data), initial earthquakes locations and stations corrections. The \ninitial model should itself have the lowest root mean square solution. Since in \nmost cases the available geophysical data is insufficient, testing a wide range of \ninitial velocity models will ensure that we will cover all possible solutions (Husen \net al., 1999). In the context of the Gulf of Cadiz it is critical to try out several \nhypothetical models because is a region of high lithospheric variability ranging \nfrom old Jurassic oceanic, transitional to thinned continental (details in chapter \nI). As suggested in Kissling et al. (1994) for areas that comprise distinctly \ntectonic and composition domains we should at least test 3 different velocity \nmodels (with realistic and also extreme velocity variations). We should also try \ndifferent velocity layering because VELEST inversion process only updates the \nvelocity value within layer, maintaining the layer thickness. \n\nFinally, the best velocity model will yield the smallest misfit (RMS) but must also \nshow coherency between of lithospheric structure (particularly subsurface \ngeological variability), Vp/Vs ratios and station delays results. \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n102 \n \n\nIII.2.2.1.Event selection for the inversion process \n\nOne of the main considerations for accurate minimum 1D-velocity determination \nis the initial data quality (Husen et al. 1999). The initial dataset should include \nwell located events with observations azimuthal gap lower than 180\u00b0and at least \n10 P wave picks (Husen et al. 1999). As input, it is also suggested to use a \nminimum sample of 500 well located events. For the case study we have only \nhave 443 events in the deployment area. From those, only a few match the \ndesired parameters. So, we will consider less restrictive conditions as \npreviously made by Dias (2005) and Carrilho et al. (2004). \n\nFrom JHD method tests we defined that mod70 (extracted from P2 NEAREST \nrefraction profile) was the best model with lowest root means square misfit \n(0.317s) on locations and a Vp/Vs =1.71. We used this model (including \nstations corrections) to select the events used as input for the minimum 1D \nvelocity model determination. Before choosing the events we ran the pharms \nroutine (created by Luis Matias) to identify phase mispickings or uncorrected \nweights. Next, we removed all redundant first phase pickings with weight 4 (less \naccurate and excluded from JHD location methods). The VELEST program only \nassumes one picking per phase, so if the first picking has weight 4 and the \nsecond is 0, it will consider the first. The final selection (details on the data in \nFigure III.31 to Figure III.33) was based on the following criteria: \n\n1.minimum phase observations set to 10 (Figure III.31); \n2.an azimuthal gap inferior to 210\u00b0 (average GAP was 112\u00b0, Figure \nIII.32); \n3.Minimum of 3 p-wave first arrival observation (phase readings are \ndominated by S-wave pickings -Figure III.33. So, it is more important to \nconstrain a minimum P-wave picking for events selection). \n\nThe final selection included 269 events with a RMS based on HYP2 and \nPRN2RES2 of 0.281s. The 269 events are distributed in three clusters: 109 are \nlocated in the area of S\u00e3o Vicente Cluster, 83 in the Gorringe cluster and 52 \nevents in the Horseshoe cluster (Figure III.34). Most hypocentres are located \nbetween depths of 20-50 km. \n\n\n\nIII.

Since we have more S-wave pickings, we choose to constrain a minimum P-wave \npicking for events selection. \n\n \n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n\n10-15 15-20 20-25 25-30 30-35 35-40 40-45 45-50\n\nN\n\u00bae\n\nar\nth\n\nqu\nak\n\nes\n\nn\u00ba phases per event\n\n0\n5\n\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n\nN\n\u00ba \n\nea\nrt\n\nh\nq\n\nu\nak\n\nes\n\nGAP\n\n0\n5\n\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n60\n\n4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26\n\nN\n\u00ba e\n\nar\nth\n\nqu\nak\n\nes\n\nphase readings\n\nobsP obsS\n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n104 \n \n\nIII.2.2.2.Reference station \n\nThe stations corrections in VELEST program are relative, calculated based on a \nreference station. Crosson (1976) points out that stations corrections are just \nadditive adjustments to arrival times and will only be distinguished from other \nparameters corrections if they are relative. In this way, stations corrections will \nreflect model departure from lateral homogeneous velocity structure. So, the \nselection of the reference station is critical in hypocenter determination because \nstations corrections are the only way to adjust local tri-dimensional geological \nstructure to the estimated 1D velocity model.  \n\nThe reference station was selected based on the criteria suggested by Kissling \net al. (1994): \n\n1. Considering the continuity of the seismic record (at least 50% of \nthe total possible readings);  \n\n2. central location within the seismic network; \n\n3. the variability of the subsurface geology. \n\nWe selected station 9 (Figure III.34 to Figure III.35 as the reference station \nbecause: i) it is located in the middle of the seismic network; ii) it recorded most \nof the selected events; iii) it lies on top of the seismic chaotic sequence with a \nthickness is ?770 ms (TWT) that is similar to the average thickness in \nNEAREST network area, around 700 ms (TWT); IV) it has one of the smallest \nstation correction estimated by the JHD method. \n\n \n\n\n\nIII. NEAREST OBS experiment \n \n\n105 \n \n\nFigure III.34- Hypocenter distributions resulting from JHD approximation method for the 269 \nevents selected for VELEST relocations: 109 events are located in the S\u00e3o Vicente canyon, 83 \nevents in Gorringe Bank and 52 events in the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain. Most events are \nlocated between 30 and 50 km deep (the black arrows mark the location of W-E and N-S \nprofiles, black triangles mark NEAREST stations and blue triangle NEAREST reference station-\n9 see section III.3.2.2, bathymetry from GEBCO). \n\n \n\n \nFigure III.35- Distribution of phase readings by seismic stations. Station 9 was selected as \nreference station because it recorded most of seismicity within the NEAREST OBS deployment \narea. Additionally, because it is located in the centre of the NEAREST seismic network and \nsubsurface geology below this stations it is similar to geological variability expressed in velocity \nmodel, i.e. station correction deduced from JHD method is minimum. \n\n \n\nIII.2.2.3.Processing parameters and sequence \n\nAs suggested in Kissling (1995), defining the minimum 1-D velocity model \nrequires multiple runs with VELEST to select and test control parameters \nappropriated to the data set. The final solution will be highly dependent on the \nvalues attributed to these parameters. A set of VELEST output files help in this \nprocedure, providing detailed information about many intermediate calculation \nsteps, even within one single iteration step (Kissling, 1995). From these \nintermediate results we can adjust the control parameters to obtain the best \ncombination to proceed to the final runs of VELEST. \n\nThe VELEST program works with an input file (velest.cmn in Figure III.36) \nwhere the main parameters controlling the inversion process are defined. These \nparameters are described in detail in Kissling (1995); we will only refer here \nsome critical input values.  \n\nThe nsp factor (Figure III.36) controls the use of P and S phase pickings to \nestimate both hypocenter and velocity model. For nsp=1, only the P-wave \nreadings are considered. This approach will help to constrain the velocity model \nbut will be less effective in establishing hypocentre location. The use of S-\nreadings will result in a more accurate hypocentre location, especially regarding \nfocal depth (Husen et al., 1999).

With the last option the earthquakes location was considerably \nimproved.  \n\nWe started by checking the best processing order based on these three options. \nThe following sequence delivered the best solution. Initially, we started by \ninverting with P-phase readings only (nsp=1) to define the velocity model \nlayering and minimize RMS values. We used the outputs as input to the next \nstep where we included S-readings and tested the best fitting Vp/Vs ratio only in \norder to define the input models for next step with variable Vp/Vs ratio. In the \nlast stage we integrated S-readings (nsp =2) with the best results from the \nprevious tests as input. We tested fixed Vp/Vs option but the results delivered a \nmuch higher RMS than using variable Vp/Vs ratios. Husen et al. (1999) used \nthe same procedure and also conclude that it resulted in the best RMS values. \nAdditionally, in marine sediments the Vp/Vs ratio decreases significantly in the \nupper subsurface layers with the transition between unconsolidated and \nconsolidated sediments (Crawford and Singh, 2008) unfavouring fixed Vp/Vs \nmodels. In the context of the study area other arguments favour the variable \nratio approach: \n\n? The presence of large scale seismic chaotic sequences (Horseshoe \nGravitational Unit and Gulf of Cadiz Imbricated Wedge) which at least in \nshallow levels should decrease S-wave velocity. Additionally, there are \nevidences for widespread fluid circulation testified by mud volcanoes \nactivity (e.g. Pinheiro et al, 2003, Hensen et al., 2015), that should also \ncontribute to low S-wave velocities and high Vp/Vs ratios. \n\n? The evidence for serpentinized upper mantle identified in P2 refraction \nprofile (Sallar\u00e8s et al., 2011). Serpentinization process decreases Vs \nvelocity, increasing Vp/Vs ratio (Christensen, 2004). \n\n\n\nIII. NEAREST OBS experiment \n \n\n107 \n \n\n \nFigure III.36 -Example of the control file for VELEST application. \n\nBesides using P and S phase readings information, VELEST also allows \ndifferentiated relative weight between the phases (swtfac). This is an important \nfactor because a clear S-wave reading is generally more difficult to identify than \nP-wave first arrival. A misinterpreted S-phase will increase uncertainties \nparticularly in hypocentre location. In this study, we attributed the same weight \nfor both phases because we already classified the S and P pickings with relative \nweight in preliminary locations. This weighting will be incorporated in VELEST \nprocess.   \n\nStations corrections inversion is introduced by nsinv parameter and will \nprimarily solve discrepancies between one-dimensional minimum velocity model \nand tri-dimensional subsurface geological variability below receiver stations. \nHowever, Dias (2005) pointed out that introducing these corrections in the early \nstage could inhibit initial velocity model to adjust to a more accurate velocity \nstructure of the study area. We tested both hypotheses and observed that \nwithout introducing stations corrections in the early stages the models will \nconverge faster to common velocity values particularly in the intermediate \nvelocity layers.  \n\nThe VELEST application limits station locations to the first layer of the velocity \nmodel, if there is a high discrepancy between stations elevation the inversion \nprocess can become unstable (Hussen et al., 1999). Since we are working with \nOcean Bottom Seismometers with 3031m of maximum depth difference \n(OBS01 and OBS16 at 5100 m and 2069m depth, respectively), including \nstations elevations (iuseelev parameter) will decrease this layer thickness and \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n108 \n \n\navoid processing instability. To avoid water and air quakes the minimum \nearthquake depth was set to 5km (zmin). \n\nFor damping factors in hypocenter location (othet, xythet and zthet) velocity \n(vthet) and stations (stathet) corrections we used the same values during the \nprocessing sequence with 0.01 for hypocenter location and stations corrections, \n1.0 for velocity model, as suggested Kissling et al. (1994). For the velocity \nmodel, additional independent layer damping control can be included in the \ninput velocity model file (input.mod). So, we increased damping factor for the \ntop layers preventing unrealistic increase of velocity. Also in order to control \nhypocenter depth and velocity adjustments during the inversion process we can \nvary Zadj and Vadj values, respectively. In the initial running we set the Vadj to \n0.5 and updated to 0.20 in the final steps. The Zadj was set to 5.0 during all \nprocessing sequence.  \n\nDuring the velocity inversion process the VELEST algorithm allows for low \nvelocity layers (lowveloclay). However, this should be limited to the cases \nwhere this is clearly indicated by the data (reflection or refraction seismic \nprofiles) because it will introduce instabilities (Kissling et al., 1994). We \nexcluded low velocity layers in all tests.   \n\nThe ittmax and invertratio parameters set the sequence for forward and \ninversion steps. During the processing sequence the invertratio was set to 2 \n(except for location steps which excluded inversion process) meaning that every \nsecond iteration will be an inversion. The iteration number was variable \ndepending on the RMS evolution during a specific step.  \n\nThe final processing sequence was the following, \n\nI.

From Figure \nIII.37 to Figure III.40, we present initial velocity models 1D profiles, events \ndistribution by depth intervals in histograms and initial RMS.  \n\nIt is worthwhile notice that all initial models have similar velocities in lowermost \nlayers. So, we would expect that all velocity models converge rapidly in these \nlayers. In Figure III.37 to Figure III.40, we detect that, for all velocity models \n(except for s02), hypocenters density is higher between 30 and 50 km, these \nlayers should be the ones where velocity convergence is more successful. For \nvelocity models f0, f04, f05, t01, n70 and mod0, we also identified a \nconsiderable number of earthquakes in the shallower layer. However, velocity \ninversion for topmost and bottom layers was conditioned by the hypocenters \ndistributions. These boundary layers generally have lower resolution than the \ncentral layers where most hypocenters are located and velocity constraints \nresulted from combined information of direct and refracted ray paths. The RMS \nresult after relocation (without stations corrections) is higher for intermediate \nvelocity model t02-0.721s and lower for the fast model f05- 0.370s. \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n110 \n \n\n \nFigure III.37- Initial slow velocity models with 14 layers (black dash is the initial model with no \ninitial stations corrections and blue bars are the earthquakes depth distribution).

In the next running we inverted only \nfor velocity model every second step (with a Vadj=0.5) and the RMS decreased \nbelow 0.35s. With the final location step the RMS improvement was minimum \nand the resulting values fluctuated between 0.3364s and 0.3258s. \n\n \n\n \nFigure III.41-RMS evolution along processing steps (in processing sequence, loc ini and loc fin \ndefine the initial relocation step, vel ini and vel fin is P- velocity inversion step and final \nrelocation run RMS is defined by the last loc ini and loc fin).

After the first inversion of the P-velocity model, all resulting location have similar \nmisfits.  \n\nIn Figure III.42 to Figure III.45, initial and final velocity models (with final \nhypocenters depth distribution) are displayed.

In \nfinal earthquakes locations RMS are 0.338 and 0.335 for model mod0 and n70, respectively. \nThere is a decrease on the number of events located on the topmost layer, concomitant with an \nincrease on the P-seismic velocity. Events are redistributed to the intermediate levels (15 and \n30 km in depth) as seismic velocity decreases slightly.  \n\n \n\nFrom the velocity models summary shown in Figure III.46, we recognize a \nconvergence on the absolute velocities for the layers with higher concentration \nof hypocenters, common to all input model, mostly to 30 to 55km depth. This \ntendency increases for input models with similar velocities, extending to an \ninterval 15-70 km depth. For velocity models f03, f04, f05, mod0 and n70, upper \nmantle velocities are defined in the 19km boundary, ranging from 7.46 to 7.80 \nkm/s. For top layers, mostly crossed by subvertical ray paths, no convergence \nis observed. Also, we would expect based on seismic reflection and refraction \ndata in this area, that there is high variability in subsurface geology below the \nrecording stations. This variation should be, at least partially, solved with \nstations corrections.  \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n116 \n \n\n \nFigure III.46- Initial models with 14 -16 layers and resulting inversion models derived from p-\nwave readings. In topmost layers, p-wave velocities increase transversally to all models. In \nthese layers, mostly crossed by subvertical ray paths, no convergence is observed is. Absolute \nvelocities converge in the layers with higher hypocenters density, mostly to 30 to 55km depth \n(except for models s01 and s02).  \n\n \n\nModels with 24 layers (step I.1 in processing sequence) \n\nTo test velocity models geometry we converted previous input models to more \ncomplex structures with 24 layers (Figure III.48 to Figure III.51). For the upper \nlayers (until 20km in depth) we included velocity increment every 1 to 2km, in \nthe intermediate layers (from 20-40km) a 2 to 3 km thickness and for lower \nlayers with 5 to 10 km thickness. \n\nSince we are using the same sample with 269 events and a velocity layering \nwith 24 levels, we will have 1100 unknowns to be determined with the inversion \nproblem. We have 2622 P-phase pickings so the inverse problem is \noverdetermined by a factor of 2.38. \n\nThe processing sequence was the same applied in the previous test (Figure \nIII.47). After initial relocation RMS values range between 0.3939 for the extreme \nslow s02_m24 and 0.3451 for the fast model f05_m24. After the velocity \ninversion step, the highest RMS value is 0.3836 and the lowest 0.3253. In the \nfinal step, we relocate the events with inverted velocity models. The RMS \ndecreased for most models, ranging from 0.3617 (model f04_m24) to 0.3249 \n(model t01_m24).

In these processing steps, we \nhave 1087-1090 unknowns to be determined with the inversion problem. We \nstill use only 2622 P-phase pickings so the inverse problem is overdetermined \nby a factor of 2.4 \n\nThe processing sequence was the same used in previous inversions and the \nresult is shown in Figure III.53. During the inversion step some velocity models \nbecame unstable: f04_m13, s02_m13 and s03_m12 (fig.III.53). Even though, \nthe majority of the starting models reached a smaller RMS values than in the \nprevious processing sequence. The lowest RMS is reached with model \nt01_m13 (0.3220) and the highest with s02_m13 (0.3376).  \n\nThe hypocentral depths reach similar distribution for models f04_m13, f05_14, \nmod0_11, n70_m13 (Figure III.55 and Figure III.57) where most events are \nlocated between 30 and 50km and there is a gap on seismic activity around 10 \nkm. In intermediate velocity models (t01_m13 and t02_m12), this gap is around \n15km (Figure III.56). For slower models (Figure III.54) hypocenter distribution is \n\n\n\nIII.

We forced the \ntopmost layer to a more realistic velocity - 3 km/s. Since we included station \ncorrections we increased the number of unknowns in the inversion process \nusing selected 269 events with 11-14 velocity layers and 25 stations, defining \n1112-1115 unknowns. We still use only 2622 P-phase pickings so the inverse \nproblem is overdetermined by a factor of 2.35. \n\nIn the first step, we improve earthquake locations with JHD method using \nVELEST. For next iterations, we inverted for velocity model in a ratio of 2 out of \n9. Improvement on RMS was minimal (Figure III.65). By introducing stations \ninversion, we decreased RMS solution to values between 0.1242s (t01_m13a) \nand 0.1184s (s02_m13a). Finally, we adjusted all parameters by simultaneously \ninverting for best locations, velocity models and stations delays. Final models \nreached similar RMS values ranging from 0.1109s (f04_m13a) and 0.1089s \n(t02_m12a and f03_m13a). The best model combines velocity structure with \ngeological constrains and low RMS is n70_m13a. The results of the inversion \nprocedure are detailed in Figure III.66 to Figure III.69. A synthesis is presented \nin Figure III.70. \n\nIn Figure III.66 to Figure III.69, the hypocenter distribution shows few shallow \nearthquakes, particularly for models: s02_m13a, s03_m12a, n70_m13a and \nmod0_m11a.

The final earthquake location RMS is 0.109 for both model \nmod0_m11a and n70_m13a, respectively. The velocity of the topmost layer as well as between \n?13 and 25km increased in both models.  Hypocentres are distributed mostly between 20 and \n50 km in depth.  Although less clear, we can still see a bimodal distribution of the hypocentres.   \n\nFrom Figure III.70, we recognize that the final slow models (s02 and s02) \ndiverge from a common velocity solution (convergence is only reached below \n43 km in depth). For the remaining models, absolute velocities are nearly \ncoincident for the depth interval between ?26 to 70 km. Similar velocities were \nalso reached in layers between 10 and 26 km.  \n\nBy adding stations delays and forcing the initial velocity for ? 3.0 km/s in all \nmodels the variability of topmost layer decreased. After inversion, the obtained \nvelocity for the topmost layer is ?3.2 km/s in all models. Crustal velocities range \nfrom 4.91 to 6.39 km/s between 8 and 10 km in depth, increasing to 6.9-7.2 \nkm/s between 10 and 15 km.

For the remaining models, absolute \nvelocities are nearly coincident for the depth interval between ?26 to 70 km. Similar velocities \nwere also reached in layers between 10 and 26 km.  \n\nThe best model, that combines velocity structure and variability with geological \nconstrains and low RMS is n70_m13a (n70 in Figure III.68 and details in Table \nIII.8). Top sediment layers velocities range from 3.2 to 3.8 km/s. Crustal \nvelocities start at 8.2 km with 5.5 km/s, set as an average of the remaining \nmodels. Bottom crustal velocity is 7.2 km/s and extends to 15.9 km. Upper \nmantle velocities are slower than a typical mantle value of ?8.0 km/s, starting at \n15.9 km with 7.65 km/s, increasing to 7.85 km/s at 19km and reaching 8.19 \nkm/s at 26.1 km. \n\nRelative stations corrections are described in Table III.6.

As discussed previously, due to high subsurface \ngeological variability a variable Vp/Vs ratio is more adequate than the use of \nfixed Vp/Vs ratios. So, we started by constructing different input S-velocity \nmodels based on fixed Vp/Vs ratio ranging from 1.68 to 1.76 (Husen et al. \n1999), with increments of 0.01. In each case previous minimum 1D P-velocity \nmodel with corresponding corrections was taken as reference P-wave velocity \nmodel. Increased damp was applied to P-velocity model for topmost, crustal-\nmantle transition (layers at 15.90 and 19.0 km) and bottom layers to prevent \nunrealistic velocities. \n\nSince we used P-wave and S-wave picking, we have a total of 6209 \nobservations. With 269 events, 25 receiver stations and a 13 layers velocity \nmodels, a number of 1162 unknowns (4x269, 25x2 and 13x2) is to be \ndetermined with the inversion problem. So, the inverse problem is \noverdetermined by a factor of 5.34. \n\nThe first step in the processing sequence was to relocate the events using the \nnew input velocity model. Introducing the velocity model with fixed Vp/ Vs and \nonly P-stations corrections was clearly unadjusted to S-wave readings as RMS \nincreased to values between 0.9946 and 0.6959. The relocation process \nresulted in insignificant reduction of RMS (Figure III.71). For the following step \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n134 \n \n\nwe inverted only for stations corrections, introducing independent S-wave \ndelays. The RMS solutions decreased to values ranging from 0.2393 to 0.2219. \nIn the next running we inverted only for velocity models (with Vadj=0.2), \nresulting in RMS values between 0.2259 and 0.2206. In the last run we inverted \nboth for stations corrections and velocity models. Small differences separate the \nfinal RMS solutions with values ranging from 0.2207 (initial Vp/Vs?1.68) to \n0.2189 (initial Vp/Vs?1.73). A sum up on RMS evolution along the processing \nsequence is presented in Figure III.71. The initial and final models are plotted in \nFigure III.72 to Figure III.73 (initial models with fixed Vp/Vs ranging from 1.68 \nand 1.74). \n\nFrom Figure III.73, we notice, except for the topmost boundary (with fixed Vp), \nsmall adjustments in the P-velocity in layers where we have low hypocenters \ndensity (even for levels with a damping factor of 10). In these layers, we also \nfind higher divergence in S-wave velocities. For the remaining levels (?20km to \n?55km) both P-wave and S-wave velocities converge to common values.  \n\nFor Vp/Vs ratios, we observe higher values in the topmost layers. This result is \nin conformity with the expected properties for shallow marine sediments. \nCrawford and Singh (2007) describe Vp/Vs ratio variations from values >8 \n(unconsolidated sediments) to 2 (consolidated sediments) in the topmost 2km \nbeneath the seafloor. Below ?10 km in depth, Vp/Vs ratio becomes more \nconsistent for all velocity models, and convergence is achieved for depth \nbetween ?20 and 55 km.  \n\n \n\n\n\nIII.

The P-velocity had small adjustments in layers with \nthe lowest hypocenters density (even for levels with a damping factor of 10). In these layers, we \nalso find higher variability in S-wave velocities. For the remaining levels (?20km to ?55km) both \nP-wave and S-wave velocities converge to common values.  Note that Vp/Vs ratios are higher \nat the topmost layers as we would expected based on for shallow marine sediments proprieties \n(detail on the text). \n\nIn Figure III.74, we plotted the velocity model with the best RMS solution (initial \nVp/Vs?1.73). With the new velocity models, including independent S-wave \nvelocity, hypocenters are relocated in two distinct intervals: few shallower \nearthquakes ranging from 7 to 10 km in depth and most of the events are \nlocated between 15 and 50 km (particularly between 30 and 45 km). These two \nintervals are separated by a seismicity gap from 10 to 15 km. Ray statistics \noutput for the last iteration step show that the number of hypocenters, the \nnumber and the length of refracted waves are higher for the layers between \n21.6 and 56.1 km (see Table III.7). So, for these layers both focal depth and \nvelocity will have the best resolution. \n\n \n\n\n\nIII.

According \nto this table, the number and the length of refracted waves are higher for the layers between \n21.6 and 56.1 km.

(1999), we tested the stability of the P and S minimum \nvelocity models and earthquake locations by perturbing hypocenter locations \nbefore relocating them with JHD and coupled inversion methods using VELEST \nroutine. If the coupled hypocenter-velocity solution is robust, we expected to \nhave a minimum shift between resulting and original hypocenters locations and \nalso small changes in the velocity model. \n\nAccordingly, we started by relocate events with the initial velocity model-f05 \n(without stations), introducing a random shift in hypocenters locations (Figure \nIII.75). The shifts for latitude were between -9.21km and 17.71km, for longitude \nbetween -12.03 km and 10.05 km and for depth between -30.07km and \n39.76km. After relocating with P and S- minimum velocity models with JHD \nmethod, hypocenters were returned back to original position with small mean \nshifts in latitude and longitude, -0.08 km and -0.07km, respectively. For focal \ndepth final mean shift was higher -0.63km; however, the original mean shift was \nalso considerably higher. We repeated the same procedure with the initial \nvelocity model s02 (again without stations corrections). Maximum and minimum \ninitial shifts were -6.65-16.65 km, -10.05-6.0 km and -33.38 -8.72 km for \nlatitude, longitude and depth, respectively (see Figure III.76). Once more, \nrelocation with JHD method could locate the events back to the original position \nwith small shifts (Figure III.76).  \n\n\n\nIII.

After relocation, hypocenters are roughly at the same position. \nThe highest shift is found in depth relocation. \n\nFinally, we relocated the events with a systematic shift of 10 km in depth. Fixed \nand damped velocity models are tested. In principle, if we have found a stable \nsolution for coupled hypocenter-velocity problem than relocation will be \nachieved by moving the hypocenters back to the original solution or by small \nadjusts in the velocity models or by a combination of both processes (Husen et \nal., 1999).

However, \nsince the NEAREST OBS deployment area is described as a region of some \nlithospheric variability (ranging from old Jurassic oceanic, transitional to thinned \ncontinental and exhumed serpentinized mantle- Sallar\u00e8s et al., 2011, Gonzalez \net al., 1996 and Sallar\u00e8s et al., 2013) these velocity models are hardly related to \na specific lithospheric structure. On the other hand, stations delays should \naccount, at least, for this subsurface geological variability because it will be \nconditioned by their respective position in the deployment area (with respect to \nthe selected reference station). Since the station correction for the reference \nstation (obs09) is zero, we must assume that the derived 1D velocity model is a \nrepresentation of the average lithosphere structure surrounding that particular \nstation.

The velocities models are hardly related \nto a specific lithospheric structure but should instead represent a balance of the upper \nlithospheric variability in the Gulf of Cadiz.   \n\n \n\nIf we compare P-minimum velocity model with the refraction and wide-angle \nreflection data in the Gulf of Cadiz area, we observe that for the upper \nsediments layers the velocities are higher.

In our velocity model, in the upper layer Vp is 3.26 km/s \nand in the lower layer Vp is 3.66 km/s. We recall that for earthquakes location \nwe replace layers resulting from gradient velocities (refraction data) with interval \nvelocities layers. This will explain partially the differences here reported for \nvelocities values. Also, we knew that during the derivation of the final models, \nthe velocities in these layers were poorly constrained because very few \nhypocenters occur there. This would explain why even when overdamping this \nlayer velocity to 3.00 km/s in the final Vp inversion step (step II.1 in processing \nsequence) this velocity increased. The resulting high Vp/Vs ratios are, however, \nin conformity with what is expected for top marine sediments (Crawford and \nSingh, 2007). \n\nCrustal velocities range from 5.18 km/s to 7.08 km/s in the P-minimum model \nwhich is only slightly higher than the results from NEAREST refraction profile P2 \n(Sallar\u00e9s et al., 2011) ranging from 4.6\u20134.8 km/s at the top to 6.9\u20137.1 km/s at \nthe base. The transition between lower crust and upper mantle is ?16km in \ndepth. The Moho depth is in conformity with the results published in Sallar\u00e8s et \nal. (2011). The slow upper mantle velocities are in agreement with Purdy \n(1975), Gonzalez et al. (1996), Sallar\u00e9s et al. (2011) and Sall\u00e1res et al. (2013). \nIn both Sallar\u00e9s et al. (2011) and Sall\u00e1res et al. (2013) these velocities values \nare attributed to mantle serpentinization with characteristic low mantle velocities \nand high Vp/Vs ratios. For the final velocity model these two criteria are \nobserved only in the layer between 19.0 -21.6km.  \n\nFinal locations with P and S-minimum velocity models \n\nAll events in the deployment area were relocated using the initial JHD method, \nwith the adapted HYPOCENTER and PRN2RES2 application (to include \nindependent P and S delays). The final velocity model and stations delays that \nresulted from VELEST application were re-converted to the STATION0.HYP file \nusing velest_steps routine (developed by Luis Matias). The JHD method was \nrun in one iteration step to improve stations corrections. In the final solution, the \nRMS was reduced from 0.317s to 0.275s. From all events, 385 have an error \ninferior to 10 km both in horizontal and vertical locations. The statistics on RMS \nvariation for events location is presented on Figure III.82. There is an increase \nof events with the lowest RMS (0.1-0.2).  \n\nFor earthquakes locations, the differences are not considerable high. In latitude \nand longitude most events change only 0.01\u00ba to 0.02\u00b0 and in depth only 2 km \n(Figure III.83). If we compare earthquakes depth location between the initial \nvelocity model locations with the resulting models from VELEST, we observe \nthat there is a decrease on the events located in the top most layers (0 -30km) \nand an increase in the hypocentres located between 30 and 45 km in depth \n(Figure III.84). \n\n \n\n\n\nIII.

Hypocenters\u2019 depths increase from Gorringe Bank to the Horseshoe \nAbyssal Plain. Shallower earthquakes are located both in the Gorringe Bank and in the S\u00e3o \nVicente clusters (AW-Accretionary Wedge). \n\n \n\nCompare with locations by land network \n\nDuring NEAREST OBS experiment 291 events were recorded by land \npermanent network in area of the NEAREST OBS stations (data provided by \nFernando Carrilho from IPMA, former IM, in NEAREST 2008 Cruise Preliminary \nReport), from which 179 events were located by both networks. If we compare \nthe epicentre distributions, we observe that most of the land network locations \nare displaced landwards, reflecting the permanent network stations distribution \n(Figure III.86). In latitude and longitude most events locations shift between 0.1\u00ba \nto 0.2\u00b0 whilst in depth this shift varies approximately 20 to 30 km (see Figure \nIII.87). \n\nConcerning depth distributions, we remark that land network locations are \nsystematically shallower than NEARST OBS solutions, with maximum \ndifferences reaching 60 km (Figure III.86 and Figure III.87). Depth alignments \naround 15km and 30km that were clearly seen on land network locations are \nundetected with the NEAREST locations. These alignments are artificial \nconstrains on depth locations.

Note that the \nformulation used to calculate local magnitude with NEAREST records is the \nsame used by routine IPMA network estimations (defined in Carrilho and Vales, \n2009). Except for two events, all NEAREST\u2019 estimated magnitudes are equal or \nhigher than the results obtains based exclusively on the land permanent \nnetworks. For 45% of the estimated magnitudes have differences between 0.2 \nand 0.4. These discrepancies result from: \n\n1. Differences in the stations-event distance between NEAREST and land \nnetworks. As discussed before, the land permanent network is \nconcentrated on the mainland to NE of Gulf of Cadiz main seismic \nactivity. For higher source-stations distances, anelastic attenuation \nincreases inducing seismic waves to lose energy, diminishing the \namplitude of the wave. Local magnitude estimations are based on the \nhighest amplitude of the wave. To contradict anelastic attenuation, \nmagnitude formulations include a distance correction term. Note that if \namplitude estimations are roughly the same for both networks and land \n\n\n\nIII. NEAREST OBS experiment \n \n\n151 \n \n\nnetwork locations are systematically biased towards land then distance \ncorrections are also lower for land network estimation. As a result \nmagnitude would also be underestimated. Accordingly, it could explain \nthe magnitude discrepancies between the NEAREST and permanent \nnetwork estimation;     \n\nOther contribution may result from differences in routine procedures for wave \namplitude measurement. IPMA routine procedures use regularly automatic and \naveraged amplitude measure based on the 3 seismometer components (with a \ncorrection term for vertical component). While, in NEAREST procedures, \namplitude was determined manually, always in the horizontal component with \nthe highest energy. These differences outcome on higher magnitude estimation \nin NEAREST results. \n\n \nFigure III.87- Difference between locations based on NEAREST OBS network and previous \nlocations based on land stations.

In these \nconditions, it is assumed that geological transitions along ray-path between \nsource region and a common station are the same, so any relative travel time \ndifferences between the two events result only from spatial offset at the \nhypocentres (see section II.4.2 for details on location methods). The double-\ndifference technique uses any combination of common phase pickings from any \nearthquake catalogues that refers to the differential travel time (catalogue data) \nand/or high precision waveform cross-correlation (cross-correlation data).  \n\nWe used the hypoDD program package (Felix Waldhauser, 2001) based on \ndouble-difference algorithm published in Waldhauser and Ellsworth (2000). Our \ntests are preliminary because it includes only catalogue differences. Cross-\ncorrelation data was tested but few matching sequences were identified. In \ndetail, we identified 26 sequences (17 were doubles) in the S\u00e3o Vicente cluster, \n12 sequences (10 doubles) in the Gorringe cluster and in the Horseshoe cluster \n7 sequences (5 doubles). Consequently, these data were only included to \ncalculate composite focal mechanisms (see section III.5 for processing steps \nand results). More improvement is necessary to include it in hypoDD re-\nlocation.  \n\n\n\nIII. NEAREST OBS experiment \n \n\n153 \n \n\nIII.2.3.2.Processing sequence \n\nSince this method is restricted to closely related earthquakes, we worked each \ncluster separately. However, hypoDD works with a series of input data \ntransversal to all clusters. We started by extracting stations information and the \nvelocity model from STATION0.HYP file (SEISAN) with a modified version of \nnsta2dd application (the original is provided in hypoDD package). Since, \nhypoDD only accepts a Vp velocity model (S-velocity is deduced by Vp/Vs ratio) \nwe re-located the events with mod0 (for model details see section III.2.2) and \nthe final Vp model was deduced with VELEST (Table III.6) with Vp/Vs =1.73. No \nstations corrections were added. In double-difference methods geological \nvariability at stations is neglected because equally affects ray-paths between \nclosely located events and common stations.  \n\nThe seismicity re-location with hypoDD involves a two-steps process. First, we \nneed to convert common catalogue files to an optimized combination of \nearthquakes pairs and common stations. We must ensure: i) strong linkage \nbetween events pairs-common station; ii) establish a net of well connected \nevents; iii) minimize redundancy in the dataset. We start by convert phase \npicking files from Nordic to hypoDD format with nor2pha application (by Luis \nMatias). The output files are converted by ph2dt application (provided by \nhypoDD original package) into selected pairs of travel times and then store in a \ndt.ct file.  \n\nThe ph2dt application works with an input file (ph2dt.inp- an example in \nAppendix II) with user defined criteria (see hypoDD manual for details). We \nwant to define a network of links between the events within our cluster. Because \nwe have few events, we use less constricted values in our variables. We used \nlarge distances to define the maximum distance in km connecting event pair \u2013 \nstations (MAXDIST- see hypoDD manual for variables details) and between \nhypocenters (MAXSEP), so that we could include the highest number of events. \nSince, we are re-locating each cluster independently we avoid pairing \ncompletely unrelated events. Also, as suggested in hypoDD manual for small \ncatalogues, we set the minimum of observations (MINOBS) per pair to be 1 \nstation and maximum (MAXOBS) to the number of station in the network. We \nset this MINLINK (minimum number of phase pairs to define a strong \nneighboring) to be 3, lower than the default (8) so that we could maximize the \nnumber of included events.  \n\nThe second step is to determine double-difference hypocentres locations using \nhypoDD application. Several variables were defined in an input file-hypoDD.inp \n(an example in Appendix II) that can change for a different set of iterations. Our \naim is to define a strong network of linked events within the same cluster. \nBecause we are considering for each case a single cluster (OBSCT=0) than the \nnetwork connectivity is controlled by the maximum hypocentral separation \nallowed between linked events controlled by WDCT (maximum events \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n154 \n \n\nseparation for catalogue data). This variable is the same as MAXSEP for \nph2dt.inp. As suggested by the author Waldhauser (2011) we set a larger \ndistance for MAXSEP and constricted our data in WDCT. At first iteration steps \nwe decided to maintain the values less constrictive. We defined WDCT to be -9, \nmeaning that no event outlier is excluded in the initial 8 iterations. In the next \niterations, we define WDCT as 20km. We used only catalogue data, with P and \nS waves\u2019 readings and we defined the least square solution to find the best \nfitting hypocentral locations (see more detail on the method in chapter II.4.2 \nAppendix II in the input data).  \n\nThe hypoDD application runs retrieves several output files:  \n\n1. hypoDD.loc and hypoDD.reloc with initial and final location (including \ninitial and final errors); \n\n2. hypoDD.sta with stations residuals. It only includes final stations \ninformation, excluded stations are absent; \n\n3. hypoDD.log with the details on critical parameters that reflects the \nperformance of each iteration steps.  \n\nThese files help stabilising new input values for future tests.  \n\nIII.2.3.3.Results  \n\nIn the next subsection we compare plots of the hypoDD.loc and .reloc in map \nand sections. Then we convert hypoDD.reloc into a Nordic file using hdd2nor \napplication and compare VELEST with hypoDD results. These steps are \nrepeated for each cluster.  \n\nIn general, the RMS for final re-locations were considerably improved from \ninitial solutions both with MOD0 and VELEST final Vp model (see details on \nTable III.10). In fact, final locations have similar average errors independently \nfrom the initial velocity. We present only the detailed results from hypoDD tests \nstarting with VELEST final Vp model because these tests were compatible with \na larger number of events. Accordingly, we only compare the latter locations, for \neach cluster, with VELEST results.  \n\nIn Figure III.89 to Figure III.91 we show the results of hypoDD re-locations in \nmap view and in two perpendicular profiles for each cluster. Because this \napplication only allows a 1D-Velocity model and no stations corrections, our \nstarting locations have high misfit (see also Table III.10). Accordingly, vertical \nmisfit is considerable higher than horizontal because depth determination is \nmore susceptible to subsurface geological variability that is minimized by \nstations corrections.  \n\nIn the final results, the average misfit decreases significantly for the events \nlocated within the seismicity clusters. For the double-difference location \nmethods improvement depends on events links. Since the events within the \n\n\n\nIII. NEAREST OBS experiment \n \n\n155 \n \n\ncentre of the cluster have more links their respective hypocentre determinations \nare more accurate. Accordingly, isolated events that exceed the maximum \nevents separation for catalogue data are excluded from final location (set as \n>20km). In the Horseshoe and S\u00e3o Vicente clusters few events were excluded \n(4 in 244). In the Gorringe cluster 14 in 142 events were excluded (Figure III.89-\nFigure III.91 and Table III.10).  \nTable III.10- Comparing general statistics for hypoDD re-locations with different velocity models. \n\nVp MOD0 \n\nDetails Initial RMS n\u00baevents Stations \nFinal \nRMS n\u00baevents Stations \n\nCluster \nSVC 0.5146 166 25 0.1704 166 25 \nHsh 0.5911 70 24 0.214 69 23 \n\nGOR 0.5423 138 24 0.2054 130 24 \nVp Velest final Vp model \n\nDetails Initial RMS n\u00baevents Stations \nFinal \nRMS n\u00baevents Stations \n\nCluster \nSVC 0.3509 173 25 0.1715 170 25 \nHsh 0.4249 71 24 0.2166 70 23 \n\nGOR 0.3501 142 23 0.2102 129 23 \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n156 \n \n\n \nFigure III.89-Gorringe Cluster re-location with hypoDD: To the left are the original locations and \non right are the relocated events (on top is map view, middle is transversal and bottom is along \nstrike, full lines are error bars).

In this cluster is also clear how misfit reduction is more \neffective for events with more links, located in the cluster\u00b4s centre.  \n\nWe now compare events locations with hypoDD and VELEST in Figure III.92 to \nFigure III.100. In map view both methods show similar locations. However, in \ndepth profiles we observe considerable differences. For both Gorringe and \nHorseshoe clusters seismicity becomes shallower with hypoDD method. In \ngeneral most hypocenters are located at depth >20km yet hypoDD re-locations \nresult in a larger number of events shallower than 20km (see Figures III.93-94 \nand III.96-97). In the S\u00e3o Vicente cluster, the depth distribution is roughly the \nsame but hypocenters re-locations with hypoDD collapse, revealing or clarifying \nsome possible alignments (see Figures III.99-100).  \n\nWith hypoDD method, we would expect to have hypocenters re-located into a \nless diffuse distribution.

Focal mechanism solutions  \n\nIII.3.1.Introduction  \n\nThe SEISAN 9.1 package (Havskov and Ottem\u00f6ller, 2011) includes several \nprograms to determine the fault plane solutions (details on the methods in \nchapter II). In this work we used FPFIT (Reasenberg and Oppenheimer, 1985) \nand FOCMEC (Snoke et al., 1984). Both programs use first motions polarities \nand a grid search to define the source model. FOCMEC can also include \namplitude ratios of P and S waves, which will help select or confirm the best \nsolution. In our case we used only P-wave first motion polarities to determine \nfocal mechanism solutions for the local seismicity.  \n\nThe FOCMEC performs a grid search to find how many polarities fit each \npossible solution. All solutions are plotted within a limit of possible wrong \npolarities (Figure III.101). The preferred solution is then selected by the user. \nThe maximum allowed polarities misfits are defined iteratively. In this work we \ndisplay only the best solutions with minimum misfits (defined by -1). FOCMEC \nallows the user to select the degree of increment for the grid search, \naccordingly, we limited our value to 5 degrees for the majority of the solutions \nand only for less constrained solutions we used 8 degree search. \n\n \nFigure III.101- Example of possible fault plane solutions plotted from FOCMEC program. \n\nThe FPFIT performs a two stage grid search to find the best fitting fault plane \nsolutions. In the initial inversion a 20\u00b0 increment was used to define the limits of \nstrike, dip and rake minimum misfit. In the next stage a refined grid search with \n5\u00b0 variations around the best solutions found in the first stage was used. One \nadvantage of using FPFIT is that the best fitting solutions are estimated based \n\n\n\nIII. NEAREST OBS experiment \n \n\n163 \n \n\non error statistics while, in contrast, with FOCMEC the best solution is selected \nvisually by the user. \n\nIII.3.2.Processing sequence \n\nWe started by selecting events with at least 10 P-polarities readings as the \nminimum limit considered for fault source estimation. To constrain focal \nmechanism solutions, we also included P-wave polarities readings in the land \nstations.  \n\nTo define the focal mechanism solutions several steps were taken: \n\n1. We started by relocate the events with the minimum P and S velocity \nmodel; \n\n2. In the next step, we ran FOCMEC application to define a preliminary \nsource solution; \n\n3. The final source solution is estimated using FPFIT program; \n\n4. Both solutions are automatically saved to events individual file. We had a \nquality classification and flag the final solution (to prevent from overwrite \nstored solution by attending new estimations). The quality is defined \nbased on the suggestion on FPFIT manual (Reasenberg and \nOppenheimer, 1985) and is described in Table III.11. An additional class \nwas added for focal plane solutions unconstrained with FOCMEC; \n\n5. The data computed by FOCMEC (focmec.dat-with events polarities, \nfocmec.out-with fault plane solutions) and from FPFIT (fpfit.fps-with final \nFPFIT solution) are converted to GMT format with faz_mecan.bat script \nand plotted using plo_mecan.bat GMT script (both from Luis Matias); \n\n6. Since the seismicity is distributed in 3 main clusters, we selected the final \nsolutions for each area based on quality criteria and computed composite \nfocal mechanism, using both FOCMEC and FPFIT; \n\n7. We also used sequence analysis to identify similar events in each cluster \nand afterwards compute composite focal mechanisms (see III.4.2.1 for \nprocessing details). \n\n \nTable III.11-Quality classes based on FPFIT manual suggestion.  \n\nFPFIT \nQuality \nFactor \n\nFit error Error in strike, dip, rake    \n<0.025&lt;20 A \n0.025 to 0.1 20 to 40 B \n> 0.10 >40 C \nUnconstrained with FOCMEC D \n\n \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n164 \n \n\nIII.3.2.1.Sequence analysis and composite focal mechanism solutions  \n\nIn order to identify the possible sequences we must cross-correlate waveforms \nfrom the same component. Hence, we started by extracting from original \nwaveforms files separated waveforms for each component and station using \nwavnstap code. The code uses the first arrival stored in events individual files to \nselect the portion of the waveform that should be extracted. This information is \nset up in an input file along with other controlling parameters: station name, \ncomponent, phase to be selected and the start \u2013 end time of extraction (e.g. 5s \nbefore and 10s after phase picking). The outputs for each selected station \ncomponent are the waveforms and three text files: e.g. NRT01Z.log; \nNRT01Z.out and NRT01Z.lis. Both .log and .out describes operation steps while \n.lis is a list of the extracted waveforms. \n\nThe cross-correlation is performed by the application multcorr using an input file \nto define several controlling parameters, like the following example: \n\n \n\nmulticorr.inp \n\n# Total of samples to use. 50% will be tapered. \n\n512 \n\n# index of the center of window and offset (positive to the left) \n\n500    50  \n\n# Low and High frequencies of filter \n\n2.    10. \n\n# lag to be computed (y/n)? \n\ny \n\n# c_tol \n\n10. \n\n \n\nWhere the total of samples is defined in a power of 2 because it was used Fast \nFourier Transforms to compute correlations. The time window is set based on a \nsample rate of 100 Hz. Accordingly, index of offset set to 50 indicated that the \nwindow starts 0.5s before the phase picking and the time window is centred at \n5s. Before cross-correlation both waveforms are filtered by a band-pass \nButterworth filter. The c_col allows negative correlation for values below 1. \n\nThe outputs are two files: \n\ni. stationX.mat file ( where X defines the component Z, Y, X) with the \ninformation of the correlation, the time \u2013lag between waveforms and also \nthe signal-noise ratio average between a master and a slave event; \n\n\n\nIII. NEAREST OBS experiment \n \n\n165 \n \n\nii. stationX.lis with the waveforms to be compared. \n\nThe sequence determination uses the matrix-sup application that combines all \ncorrelation matrixes computed above and outputs a list of sequences. It uses a \nparameter file that establishes the correlation limits to define a sequence, \nmatrix-sup.inp, an example as follow: \n\n \n\nmatrix-sup.inp \n\n# c_min minimum value for a sequence to be declared \n\n0.7 \n\n# sn_min minimum s/n for a correlation to be accepted \n\n1.5 \n\n# sn_max saturation s/n. All values above will be truncated \n\n10. \n\n# p_pow power to be applied to s/n to obtain the weigth (0 no weight) \n\n0.7 \n\n \n\nWhere c_min is minimum correlation, sn_minimum is signal to noise minimum, \nsn_max is signal to noise maximum and p_power is power value to determine \ns/n weigth. The outputs are files with lists of the events associated with each \nsequence. After determining all sequences, we evaluated the initial locations for \neach sequence and excluded the ones with events distantly related. We used \nthe VELEST velocity model for the initial location. In the next step we improved \nsequence location by adapting station correction to each dataset. Finally, we \ncomputed composite focal mechanism solution for each sequence. \n\nIII.3.3.Results \n\nThe final focal mechanism solutions based on FPFIT estimations are displayed \nin Figure III.102. We could estimate 124 fault plane solutions, 68 % of those \nwith A or B quality (a total of 82 events plotted in Figure III.103). The details on \nthe solutions are on Appendix III and related individual plots are in Appendix IV. \n\n \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate boundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n166 \n \n\n \n\n\n\nIII.

(2010), 31 focal mechanisms computed with FOCMEC routine \n(and additionally the MECSEI algorithm), also using the P- wave first arrives \npolarities in OBS and Portuguese land stations were reported. These solutions \nwere constrained using at least 8 polarities. With the final results of NEAREST \nOBS experiment, we added 58 new solutions, with A and B quality, to the \nprevious catalogue. Because we consider events with at least 10 polarities, two \nevents from Geissler et al. (2010) catalogue are not included in our work \n(events 5th and 21st of March 2008, with 9 polarities, in southern cluster at figure \n3 of the referenced work). Also, 3 events solutions were classified with C quality \n(the 22nd of May 2008 at the southern cluster and outside the clusters area, both \nthe 6th and the 7th of November 2007, ibid.).  \n\nFrom the A and B quality solutions, 39 % are located in S\u00e3o Vicente, 25% at \nHorseshoe and 17% at Gorringe clusters. The remaining events (17%) are \nlocated outside these clusters, mostly in the SW continental margin and below \nthe Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge. These results reflect the following \nlimitations of both NEAREST and Land networks coverage: \n\n? The Gorringe cluster is displaced from land network distribution and at \nthe edge of the NEAREST network; \n\n? Outside the clusters, the events are located mostly out of the NEAREST \nnetwork boundary or in the vicinity of poor recording stations (inhibited by \nthe presence of the accretionary wedge - see III.3.2 for details) \n\n? The Horseshoe cluster is well constrained by NEAREST network; \n\n? The S\u00e3o Vicente Cluster, the area with higher seismic activity in the \nNEAREST deployment area, is covered both by NEAREST and land \nstations networks. \n\nThe diversity of the fault plane solutions identified, ranging from reverse dip-slip \nto strike-slip and even normal dip-slip, reflects the complexity of the source \nmechanisms to this low to intermediate magnitude seismicity (see Figure \nIII.103). These results are also valid if we inspect each cluster individually (see \nFigure III.104 to Figure III.109).  \n\nIn the Gorringe cluster, 31 focal mechanisms were computed, 15 of those with \nA and B quality (see Figure III.104). These new solutions considerably update \nthe previous catalogues for this area where only a few focal mechanism \nsolutions were known (e.g. Grimison and Chen, 1986; Burfon et al., 2004 and \nStich et al, 2010).  \n\nThe prevailing focal mechanisms are oblique (combinig strike-slip with a reverse \nslip) and reverse dip-slip. In fact, if we combine all polarities observations to \ndefine a composite focal mechanism, we obtain the oblique solution shown in \nFigure III.105. However, this solution is poorly constrained and has several \nincompatible polarities. We inspected the focal mechanism distribution in depth \n\n\n\nIII. NEAREST OBS experiment \n \n\n171 \n \n\nbased on two perpendicular profiles (Figure III.104), both cross-sections show \nan unclear relation between depth and a particular type of fault solutions. It is \nworthwhile noting the existence of normal dip-slip focal mechanisms at ? 30km \nin depth. In addition, from the two events sequences determined based on \nwaveform cross-correlation resulted two composite focal mechanisms (see \nTable III.12 for details and Figure III.116 for solutions and polarities \ndistributions), i) one with normal dip-slip solution also located at ?40 km in depth \n(see SEQ08 in Table III.12 and Figure III.106 and Figure III.107), ii) whereas the \nsequence SEQ01 has a pure-strike slip solution (see Table III.12 and Figure \nIII.106-Figure III.107) and is located in the transition between two different \ndomains that will be discussed in the chapter IV. In opposition to sequence \nSEQ08 where several polarities are incompatible with the focal mechanism \nsolution, SEQ01 composite solution is well constrained with only two \nunmatched polarities.  \n\n \nFigure III.104-Focal mechanism solutions with quality A and B in the Gorringe cluster area \n(green circles are pure strike-slip, red are reverse, blue are normal and yellow oblique solutions, \nbathymetry compilation from Zitellini et al., 2009).

Detail discussion on the events location \nand relation with geological structures will be presented in chapter IV. SEQ08 shows a roughly \nnormal dip-slip solution. However, there are some incompatible polarities.  \n\n \n\n\n\nIII. NEAREST OBS experiment \n \n\n173 \n \n\n \nFigure III.107- Composite focal mechanisms for sequences depicted in Table III.12.

Note that SEQ01 focal \nmechanism is located in the transition between Gettysberg and Ormonde seamounts. Detailed \ndiscussion on the SEQ01 location and relation with geological structures will be presented in \nchapter IV. SEQ08 defines a roughly normal dip-slip solution and is located at ?35km in depth.  \n\nIn the Horseshoe cluster 26 fault plane solutions were found with 10 events \ncommon to Geissler et al. (2010). From these, all events show similar solutions \nexcept for the 23rd February and the 5th May 2008 event (Figure III.108) for \nwhich the computed fault mechanism solution is considerably different from \nGeissler et al. (2010, in figure 3) possibly resulting from the use of different \nmethods and/or data. In the first case, we added new polarities the fault plane \nsolution (see Figure III.108). For the 5th May 2008 event, even though the same \nnumber of polarities was used we recovered different solutions. Discrepancies \nresult from polarities re-distribution in the focal sphere with event location based \non a different velocity model. This should be particularly critical for FPFIT \nsolution since FOCMEC results match Geissler et al. (2010) solution. A moment \ntensor solution was also computed in Stich et al. (2010, figure 4). In this case, \ndifferences result from both method and data. The moment tensor solution was \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n174 \n \n\ncomputed based on signals recorded at seismic broadband stations from land \nnetworks in Portugal, Spain and Morocco.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure III.108- 23th February and 5th May 2008 event fault mechanism solutions. Note that black \nline is FPFIT, blue line is FOCMEC, red line is MECSEI90 from Geissler et al., 2010 and orange \nline is the moment tensor in Stich et al., 2010. Discrepancies between focal mechanism \nsolutions in our work and the ones in previous studies result mostly from using different \nmethodologies and a datasets (in our work we added new polarities).  \n\nIn general, the focal mechanisms in the Horseshoe cluster show mostly strike-\nslip solutions, particularly to the East (see profile P2 and map view in Figure \nIII.109). To the west, focal mechanism show a more mixed pattern with \nsolutions ranging between reverse to strike \u2013slip kinematics, with a variety of \ncombined oblique solutions. Normal dip-slip mechanisms at depth >40km were \nalso obtained (Figure III.109). Similar solutions were already revealed by Stich \net al. (2005, 2010) and Geissler et al. (2010). However, a plausible source \nmechanism was not proposed. \n\nComposite focal mechanism for A and B quality events show solutions similar to \ngeneral results: pure strike\u2013slip and reverse mechanism with a slight strike-slip \ncomponent, respectively (see Figure III.110). Yet, again, several polarities are \nincompatible with computed focal mechanisms. More reliable composite \nsolutions resulted from sequence analysis. In table III.13 we sum up the details \non the sequences resulted from cross-correlation analysis with events closely \nlocated.  \n\nThe focal mechanism for sequence SEQ03 combines 3 events with 63 \npolarities. It shows a reverse solution with a minor strike-slip solution (see \nFigure III.111 to Figure III.112). This mechanism is similar to the 7th of May \n2008 ML 3.9 earthquake recorded in the NEAREST network (see event 53 in \nFigure III.109) and 28th February 1969 earthquake with Ms 7.9 (see Figure I.13). \nHowever, both events are located ? 20km deep while this sequence is at ? 40 \nkm in depth and further to East.  \n\n \n\n\n\nIII.

To the SE, focal mechanism solutions are \nroughly pure strike-slip while to NW events show a more complex pattern. Note that few normal \ndip-slip solutions are located at ?5okm in depth. The meaning of these location will be debated \nin the next chapter. \n\n \nFigure III.110-Composite focal mechanisms based on A (left) and B (right) quality solutions. \nComposite focal mechanism show solutions similar to general results: pure strike\u2013slip and \nreverse mechanism with a slight strike-slip component. Yet, again, several polarities are \nincompatible with computed focal mechanisms.  \n\nThe sequences SEQ05 and SEQ06 are doubles with 26 and 38 polarities, \nrespectively (see Table III.13, Figure III.111 and  Figure III.112). Sequence \nSEQ06 shows a pure strike-slip mechanism while SEQ05 resulted in a strike-\nslip with a slight normal dip-slip component.

It is worthwhile notice that \nthe focal mechanism for SEQ03 is similar to the 7th of May 2008 ML 3.9 earthquake recorded in \nthe NEAREST network and 28th February 1969 earthquake with Ms 7.9. Yet, both events are \nlocated at ?20km in depth while SEQ03 is located at ?40km and further to theEast. SEQ05 \nshows a peculiar location since is a normal-dip slip mechanism at 40km in depth. SEQ06 \ndefines pure-strike slip solution that is similar with several individual solutions retrieved from \nNEAREST network for earthquakes located in the area.  \n\nWe identified 33 focal mechanism solutions in the S\u00e3o Vicente Cluster adding \n17 new events to the previous dataset. Once more, we recognized some \ndiscrepancies with previous works. Two examples are shown in Figure III.113. \nIn both cases our solutions are different from Geissler et al. (2010) mostly \nbecause we added new polarities to preliminary solutions. In the 20071125A \nevent, we also re-interpreted some first arrivals with opposite polarities.  \n\n \nFigure III.113- 25th November and 12th December 2007 events fault mechanism solutions.

(2010) mostly because we added new \npolarities to preliminary solutions. \n\nThe S\u00e3o Vicente cluster is where most events occurred during the NEAREST \nexperiment. Dominant focal mechanisms are strike-slip and reverse dip-slip. \nHowever there are several earthquakes with oblique solutions, mostly \ncombining pure \u2013strike slip with reverse dip-slip component. An example is the \n11th January 2008 earthquake with ML=4.8, the highest magnitude recorded \nduring NEAREST experiment (see event 78 in Figure III.114 and details at \nAppendix IV.c). This focal mechanism is similar to the one defined to the 17th \nDecember 2009 earthquake, with local magnitude 6.0. Both events are located \nin the same area and at the depth range ?35-40km. It is noteworthy that once \nmore we have extensional events located at depth ?20-40km (see Figure \nIII.114). \n\nComposite focal mechanism based on A and B quality events have similar \nsolutions nearly pure-strike-slip kinematics (see Figure III.115). Contrasting is \nthe diversity of fault plane solutions derived from identified sequences (see \nTable III.14 for details and Figure III.116-Figure III.117): \n\n?

Sequence SEQ15 show roughly strike-slip solutions but striking in \ndifferent direction than SEQ05 and SEQ08; \n\n? The sequence SEQ09 have reverse dip-slip kinematics with a very low \nangle plane  at ?20 km or contrastingly a sub-vertical plane; \n\nSequence SEQ11 is located at ?40km in depth and shows normal dip-slip \nkinematics. \n\n \nFigure III.114- Focal mechanism solutions with quality A and B in the S\u00e3o Vicente cluster area \n(green circles are pure strike-slip, red are reverse, blue are normal and yellow oblique solutions, \nbathymetry compilation from Zitellini et al., 2009).

There is no clear correlation \nbetween a type of focal mechanism with a particular area in the map view or in depth.   \n\n \n\nFinally, we present the fault plane solutions in the area of the Gulf of Cadiz \nAccretionary Wedge. It is important to note that this area is in the eastern limit \nof the NEAREST OBS network (see Figure III.118) thus the events locations \nand source mechanism are less accurate. Nevertheless, we computed 13 focal \nmechanism solutions, mostly reverse dip-slip and pure-strike-slip. Normal dip-\nslip focal mechanisms located at depth > 40km were also obtained.  \n\n\n\nIII.

Several reverse dip-\nslip solutions are obtained sub-parallel to the accretionary wedge striking direction. Again it is \nworth notice a normal dip-slip focal mechanism solution at 40 km in depth.   \n\nThe final results are in agreement with the preliminary solutions published by \nGeissler et al. (2010) based on the best events reported from the NEAREST \nexperiment. Additionally, these results are also in conformity with previous \nstudies for this area (Grimison and Chen, 1986; Buforn et al., 2004; Stich et al., \n2010). Normal dip-slip solutions were also identified in the upper mantle, as it \nwas already reported by Stich et al (2010) and Geissler et al. (2010).  \n\nBoth individual focal mechanisms and composite solutions within the three \nseismicity clusters indicate that seismicity results from the combination of \ndifferent deformation processes. The compressive SHmax resulting from most \nof the solutions is in agreement with the transpressive plate kinematics reported \nby several authors between Iberia and northwest Africa; however, the normal \nfault solutions located in the mantle require an alternative explanation. \n\n \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n182 \n \n\nIII.4. Tensor analysis \n\nIII.4.1.Introduction \n\nWe used the Focal Mechanism Stress Inversion (FMSI) package to define the \nstress tensor of the studied area based on focal mechanism data. This program \nuses a grid search inversion technique to find the best fitting regional stress \ntensor, a method described in Gephart and Forsyth (1984). The process implies \na simultaneous adjusts of individual fault plane solutions and the principal stress \ndirections. The best stress model imposes the smallest rotation on fault plane \nsolutions to consistently combine stress orientations with fault slip direction and \nsense (more details on the method in chapter II). \n\nIII.4.2.Processing sequence \n\nThe FMSI package was changed by Luis Matias to simplify processing \nsequence. So, the following steps were taken:  \n\n1. Since seismicity is distributed in three areas, we subdivided the FMSI \nanalysis accordingly. The input data results from the conversion from \nGMT plotting .mec format to FMSI format .inp using dataset application. \nThe data weight could be attributed from estimated magnitude; \n\n2. A preliminary evaluation of the P and T data were established with a \nmodified version of the PTplot application. This program uses also GMT \nplotting files format to plot a lower hemisphere equal area stereographic \nprojection of the P and T axis derived from focal mechanism solution. \nThis projection helps to identify the variability of the initial data; \n\n3. The inversion for the stress tensor was reached using a modified version \nof the fmsilm application. This version uses an input file fmsi.in with the \nparameters for the inversion. In this input file the user defines the initial \nmaximum and minimum stress axis directions (?1 and ?3). The fmsilm \napplication performs a three steps grid search of the best fitting stress \nmodel. In the first inversion, a coarse GRID search is defined with 10 \ndegree spacing around a predefined ?1 (maximum stress) and ?3 \n(minimum stress) directions, an angular variation and principal stress \nrelative magnitude (R= (?2- ?1)/ (?3- ?1)). The subsequent inversion \nsteps uses grid searching of 5 and 2 degrees. The initial stress directions \nwere defined by previous inversion solutions. In the input model one of \nthe following methods for inversion process has to be defined: exact, \napproximate or pole rotation methods. We used the exact method which \nfinds the minimum rotation about any axis of general orientation which is \nneed to match the observed fault plane/slip directions with one consistent \nwith a given stress model (Gephart and Forsyth, 1984). The output files \nare a .out file with the tested stress directions and misfit residual and a \n\n\n\nIII. NEAREST OBS experiment \n \n\n183 \n \n\n.fmsi file with the best fitting stress model residuals, ?1 and ?3 directions \nand the relative stress magnitude estimation (R). \n\n4. To evaluate the best stress tensor model we used Plo-s1.bat script which \nplots a stereonet with the contour residuals and the points used to \nconstrain this contours lines.  \n\n5. Additionally, we checked fault plane solutions consistency with the best \nstress tensor using fmsietab. This application delivers an output file with \nthe misfit rotations of each fault observation (for principal and auxiliary \nplanes) and a given stress model computed based on the exact method. \nPlanes with resulting low shear stress are marked with *. Another \nconsistency criterion is unambiguity of the preferred fault plane selection. \nThe difference between the rotation misfit of both planes (principal and \nauxiliary) should be > 10\u00b0 so that we can clearly define the principal fault \nplane solution. The preferred fault plane should also have a misfit lower \nthan 20\u00b0. This is automatically inspected with bestslip application \n(developed by Luis Matias). \n\n6. Finally, we rechecked fault planes fit with the regional stress model in a \nMohr\u2019s diagram. This allows the visual inspection of the consistence of a \ncombination of fault planes with reasonable criteria of failure. Slip is most \nlikely on planes with high shear stress and low normal stress (Gephart \nand Forsyth, 1984). \n\n7. If the combination of fault plane solution and regional stress tensor \nresulted in a large misfit we repeated the processing steps with a new set \nof focal mechanism selection. This procedure was repeated until we \nmeet a reasonable misfit.  \n\nIII.4.3.Results \n\nWe started by testing the inversion process with a compilation of the best focal \nmechanism solution of each cluster and using local magnitude as weighting \nparameter. In all cases, for the same events selection, the average rotation \nmisfit was higher with weighted data. As an example, in the Gorringe cluster the \nsame dataset had a tensor solution with an average degree misfit of 8.26 and \n7.95, with and without magnitude weighting, respectively. This can result from \nthe heterogeneity of focal mechanism solutions in this micro-seismicity setting \nas discussed elsewhere in this work. Accordingly, we excluded weighting from \nsubsequence tests. The main results are presented next. \n\nGorringe Bank cluster \n\nThe FMSI inversion is a trial and error process that can be improved by testing \ndifferent datasets. In the first step, we included all the best focal mechanism \nsolution (see Figure III.119) and subsequently improved the dataset by \nexcluding events that were inconsistent with the best tensor solution. We \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n184 \n \n\nstarted with 16 events and an average error of 7.95\u00b0 and concluded with 14 \nevents and 4.40\u00b0. The details on the dataset are summed up in table III.15 \n(dataset all_AB).  \n\nWe plotted P-T axis for all_AB dataset and resulting ?1 in a stereographic equal \narea lower hemisphere projection (Figure III.120). The resulting ?1 is in \nagreement with SHmax striking direction, roughly NW-SE, previously published \ndata for the area (Grimison and Chen, 1986, Ribeiro et al, 1996, Stich et al, \n2003, Carrilho et al, 2004). Finally, we recheck fault planes fitness with the \nregional stress model in a Mohr diagram (Figure III.121). Because slip on a fault \nis privileged in high shear and low normal stress conditions in some events slip \nis unfavored with this stress model because shear stress (?) is low and normal \nstress (?n) is too high (e.g. 1, 4 and 5).  \n\n \nFigure III.119- Epicenters distribution in the Gorringe cluster (bathymetry compilation from \nZitellini et al., 2009). Also is shown the focal mechanisms selected for tensor inversion. Initial, \nwe used all events in the same dataset. Yet, because in the Gorringe bank seismicity is \ndistributed asymmetrically, we subdivided our catalogue into to a NE and SW sub-clusters.   \n\n \nTable III.15-Statistics and resulting tensor based on selected datasets. \n\n \n\n \n\nN\u00ba events RMS misfit (\u00b0) ?1, dip (\u00b0)  ?1, az(\u00b0) ?2, dip (\u00b0)  ?2, az(\u00b0) ?3, dip (\u00b0)  ?3, az(\u00b0) R\nall_AB 14 4.403 58 120 29 329 13 231 0.4\n\nNE 6 1.545 36 168 45 306 23 60 0.8\nSW 7 2.302 24 158 65 358 8 251 0.4\n\ndataset\nstatistics tensor\n\n\n\nIII.

Note that for events 1, 4 or 5 slip is \nunfavored with this stress model because shear stress (?) is low and normal stress (?n) is too \nhigh. \n\nTo improve fault plane solutions-stress tensor model consistency we subdivided \nthe original AB focal mechanisms dataset in two sub-groups because the \nseismicity distribution along the Gorringe cluster is asymmetric (see Figure \nIII.119): \n\n1. One in the NE sector that initially integrated 12 events with an average \nminimum rotation misfit of 5.325 \u00b0. The final dataset, after excluding fault \nplane with low shear stress, included only 6 events and the minimum \naverage misfit was 1.545 \u00b0 (sum up on the dataset and tensor directions \nin Table III.15, P-T axis and ?1 stereographic projections in Figure \nIII.122); \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n186 \n \n\n2. One in the SW sector, initially with 10 events and a RMS 6.595. After \nexcluding 3 events, we reduced the average minimum degree misfit to \n2.302 (sum up on the dataset and tensor directions in Table III.15, P-T \naxis and ?1 stereographic projections in Figure III.124). \n\nFor both sub-clusters, the ?1 azimuth is similar, 158\u00b0 and 168\u00b0, for NE and SW \ndatasets respectively. The dip angle is higher to the NE ?36\u00b0 and lower to the \nSE ?24\u00b0. Both dip angle are considerably lower than the global solution (AB \ndataset) for which dip angle was 58\u00b0.  \n\nThe tensor solution for the NE sub-cluster shows R=0.8, considerably different \nfrom the results for both global and SW datasets (R=0.4 for both, Table III.15). \nIn the Mohr diagram (Figure III.123), the high R value results in the following \nrelative proportions between the principal stress directions: dimension ?1 >> ?2 \nand ?3. The NE sub-cluster is clearly in a compressional regime. Also note that \nat least two events are in an unfavorable slip condition (4 and 1). Accordingly, \nthese events are the ones where P-axes diverge more clearly from ?1 azimuth \nsolution (see Figure III.122).   \n\n \nFigure III.122- P (red) T (blue) axes (to the left) and ?1 (to the right) for NE dataset lower \nhemisphere equal area stereographic projection. The contour lines defines isolines of tensor \nmodel\u2019s misfits. Note that in this case the contour lines with lowest misfit are coincident with a \ngroup of P-axis in PT axis projection (left- events 2, 3 and 5). \n\n \n\n\n\nIII.

In the Mohr diagram (Figure III.125) all events fit slip conditions. The \nrelative proportion between the principal stress axes are in agreement with \nglobal stress dataset, R=0.4. These results indicate that: \n\n1. The asymmetric distribution of the focal mechanism solution in the \nGorringe cluster, with more events in the SW, biased the global dataset \nresult. \n\n2. The NE and SW-sub-clusters are distinct and may result from different \nseismogenic mechanisms. \n\nAccordingly, the best fitting tensor are the solutions resulting from sub-cluster \nanalyses. \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n188 \n \n\n \nFigure III.124 - PT axis (left) and ?1 (right) for SW dataset lower hemisphere equal area \nstereographic projection with contour lines of the misfit distribution.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure III.125- The MOHR diagram for the southwestern dataset with the best fitting fault plane \nsolutions (blue are the rotated fault planes and red are the original).

The first inversion test resulted in an average \nminimum rotation misfit of 5.963 degrees, with 3 very low shear slip events. In \nthe next step, we removed inconsistent data and ended up with all_AB dataset \nin Table III.16 (and Figure III.127 for P-T axes and sigma 1 details). In the Mohr \ndiagram only one event (see event 9 in Figure III.128) is inconsistent with the \ntensor model. \n\n \n\n\n\nIII.

(2010) \npreliminary results for the same area (?1 with orientation 12 \u00b0, N351\u00b0E, see \nreference work). We consider that differences result from adding new events to \ninitial dataset in Geissler et al (2010). Yet, divergence is larger for dip of the \nminimum stress axis that is?2\u00b0and R solution ?0.7 (idem) contrasting with our \nresults, ?63\u00b0 and 0.5, respectively. It is worthwhile to consider that the average \nmisfit is lower in the preliminary results ?2.2\u00b0 but only 13 events were included \nin the inversion process. \n\nTo improve our result we tested 2 sub-clusters; one to the East where most \nfocal mechanism solutions are clearly strike \u2013slip and to the W with a more \n\n\n\nIII.

The eastern sub-cluster results (see Figure III.129 and Figure \nIII.130) are similar to the total dataset but the error is lower. The stress tensor \nfor western dataset is completely different from the remaining results but the \nerror is considerably lower and stress directions are consistent with the \nGorringe cluster, further to the west (see Figure III.131 and Figure III.132). \n\nBy subdividing the dataset into two sub-clusters, we decreased both the stress \nmodel misfit and improved the slip conditions fit to the fault plane solutions.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure III.129- PT axis (left) and ?1 (right) for E dataset lower hemisphere equal area \nstereographic projection.

The final dataset included 20 events and the average \nmisfit was 3.836\u00b0. The P-T axes distribution in a stereographic projection \n(Figure III.134) is heterogeneous with strike direction ranging from 90\u00b0-180\u00b0 and \n300\u00b0-360\u00b0.   \n\nThe best fitting ?1 strike is approximately NW- SE (Figure III.134) diverging from \nGeissler et al., (2010) preliminary results (roughly WNW-ESE) but in agreement \nwith previous works (e.g. Carrilho et al., 2004). The main difference between \nthis work and Geissler et al. (2010) is the dataset as in this work we present a \ncomplete catalogue for NEAREST experiment. The additional data resulted in a \ndifferent stress tensor model for S\u00e3o Vicente cluster. Also we could reduce the \nmodel misfit from 4.6\u00b0 in the Geissler et al, (2010) to 3.8\u00b0.

Conversely, we observe that to the North events distribution is \nmore discrete and to the South more diffuse. Accordingly, we divided the initial \ndataset in two sub-clusters, one to the North and the other to the South. The \nresult shows that in the South dataset, the best fitting ?1 is roughly NNW -SSE \nand dipping 50\u00b0 south. Yet, in the P-T axes stereographic projection (see Figure \nIII.136) most plots are less steep, only 3 out of 10 events are in the dipping \nrange between 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0. In the Mohr diagram we recognize that only 4 \nevents have reasonable slip conditions (see events 7, 8, 1 and 10 in Figure \nIII.137). \n\nThe North dataset shows a best fitting ?1 ?NW-SE coherent with most P-T axes \nplot in the stereographic projection (see Figure III.138).

In the Mohr diagram shows at \nleast three events (1, 5 and 7 in Figure III.139) have unfavorable slip conditions \nwith low shear stress and high normal stress at the principal fault plane \nsolutions.

Summary and Discussion \n\nThe meaning of the persistent small to intermediate magnitude seismicity \nrecognized in the Gulf of Cadiz is still particularly not understood. To address \nthis problem the EC project NEAREST conducted a passive seismic experiment \nin the Gulf of Cadiz with the deployment of temporary OBS network. The \nexamination of the continuous data stream presented here allowed the \ndetection of a number of local events that were not identified by the land \nnetworks of Portugal, Spain or Morocco.  \n\nPreliminary earthquakes locations resulted in 590 events with local magnitude \nbetween 0.9-4.8, located in the deployment area with an average misfit ?0.7s. \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n198 \n \n\nOne of the main objectives was to obtain an accurate hypocentres location. \nSolving earthquakes locations depends on several factors including survey \nnetwork geometry, seismic phase identification and arriving time readings \naccuracies as well as the knowledge on the structure and nature of the \nseismogenic lithosphere. Other limitation outcomes from applying one \ndimensional velocity model to determine hypocenter location in a tri-dimensional \nvariable space. This problem is particularly relevant when there is a high lateral \nunpredictability in the lithospheric structure as in the case of our study area. \n\nWe improved hypocentres determination by selecting a restrict dataset (443 \nevents), within the deployment area and applying three different location \nmethods: Joint Hypocenter Determination (JHD), simultaneous inversion for \nhypocenter-velocity model and double-difference techniques. In JHD method, \nlithospheric variability and subsurface geology were introduced by testing \ndifferent velocity models based on local geophysical data and adding \nindependent P and S stations corrections. The average misfit of the initial \nlocations decreased from 0.76s to 0.32s.  \n\nWe used the VELEST, for simultaneous inversion of hypocenter location, \nstations corrections and 1D velocity model for P and S waves. As before, \nstations corrections will account for particularly subsurface geological variability. \nHowever, additional lithospheric variations could be introduced by adopting \nvariable seismic velocities and Vp/Vs ratio for each layer within the limitation the \n1D velocity model. We decreased final locations average misfit from 0.316 to \n0.275 for the events within the deployment area.  \n\nFinally, we tested the double-difference location method with hypoDD. This \nmethod is adequate if applied for events closely related because in these \nconditions it is assumed that the travel time difference between two events \nrecorded in the same station results exclusively from the distance between the \nhypocentres. Accordingly, hypoDD uses a P-velocity model; S-velocities are \nderived based on fixed Vp/Vs and no stations corrections. Preliminary results \nindicate that a decrease in depth distribution in compare with previous locations \nderived from JHD and VELEST. However, we need to improve the accuracy of \nour results by testing different parameters and including wave cross-\ncorrelations. \n\nThe analysis of the complete data set reveals 3 main clusters of earthquakes: in \nthe Gorringe Bank, Horseshoe Abyssal Plain and S\u00e3o Vicente Canyon. The \nlater coincide with the location of the 3 larger instrumental earthquakes in the \narea: i) both the 28th February 1969 (Mw?7.8) and the 12th February 2007 \n(Mw=6.0) and ii) the 17th December 2009 (MW=5.5), respectively. Most of the \nsmall magnitude earthquakes are located in the mantle (depth between 30 and \n50 km), like the hypocenters of these three earthquakes derived from waveform \ninversion. With respect to land stations solutions it appears that the same \nearthquakes are relocated mainly to SW and deeper.  \n\n\n\nIII. NEAREST OBS experiment \n \n\n199 \n \n\nSeismicity depths reaching a maximum of 50 km for events with Mb > 5.0, in the \nGulf of Cadiz, was already referred in Grimison and Chen (1986). In the same \nwork, this depth is described as coincident with ?600\u00b0C\u00b1100\u00b0C isotherm in an \nold oceanic lithosphere. Later on, Buforn et al., 2004 also suggested, based on \na seismic catalogue comprising events with magnitudes ? 3.5, that seismicity in \nthe area is mostly located above 50 km in depth. Our results are in agreement \nwith these preview studies. However, earthquakes locations are improved with \nNEAREST network as result we can clearly identify a bimodal distribution of \nseismicity in depth, with a dominant interval between 30-50 km. This was not \nclear from previous works retrieved restrictedly from land permanent seismic \nnetworks locations. In NEAREST preliminary data published in Geissler et al. \n(2010), it was observed a striking absence of seismicity between 20 and 40 km \nin depth. In our study this interval is reduced to roughly between 10 and 20 km. \nIn the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain there is an absence of events above 15 Km in \ndepth and in the Gorringe Bank above 10 km. However, the S\u00e3o Vicente \nCanyon cluster has some events above 10 km but most seismicity is \nconcentrate between 20 and 50 km. \n\nOur focal mechanism solutions indicate a mixed pattern, mostly strike-slip and \nreverse dip-slip with a very few normal mechanisms, showing us that processes \nrelated with the local seismicity must be complex probably involving the \ninteraction between different active geological structures and reflecting local \nrheological contrasts. These hypotheses will be further explored in the next \nchapter. The retrieved pattern was already envisaged in Geissler et al. (2010) \nand is coherent with Carrilho et al. (2004) results retrieved from events with \n1.9>ML> 3.7 recorded at land seismic stations (IPMA).  \n\nNEAREST network dataset includes mostly micro-seismicity (only 6 out of 82 \nfocal mechanism solutions with ML >3.5). It is not clear that micro-seismicity and \nintermediate to high magnitude earthquakes have comparable or similar source \nmechanism. Conversely, NEAREST solutions are in agreement also with earlier \nstudies of Grimison and Chen (1986), Borges et al. (2001), Buforn et al. (2004) \nor Stich et al. (2010) based on events with magnitudes >3.5.  A rather puzzling \nresult is the presence of normal dip-slip mechanisms at 30 or 50 km in depth. \nThe same observation was already described both in Geissler et al. (2010) and \nStich et al. (2010).  \n\nThe stress tensor analysis show a maximum compression roughly parallel to \nNW-SE in the Western Horseshoe sub-cluster, the S\u00e3o Vicente cluster and the \nSW Gorringe to nearly NNW-SSE in the NE Gorringe and in the Eastern \nHorseshoe sub-clusters.  \n\n \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n200 \n \n\nIV.

Abstract  \n\nThe seismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz is characterized by permanent low to \nintermediate magnitude earthquakes, occasionally disturbed by high magnitude \nevents such as the M~8.7 1755 Great Lisbon earthquake or the M=7.9 event of \n28th February 1969. Micro-seismicity was recorded during one year by a \ntemporary network of 25 ocean bottom seismometers (OBSs) in an area of high \nseismic activity, encompassing the potential source areas of the mentioned \nlarge magnitude earthquakes. We combined micro-seismicity analysis with \nprocessing and interpretation of deep crustal seismic reflection profiles and \navailable refraction data to investigate the possible tectonic control of the \nseismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz area. Three relationships with seismicity are \nexplored: i) active tectonic structures, ii) lithospheric transitions and inherited \nMesozoic architectures and iii) fault weakening mechanisms. Our results show \nthat micro-seismicity is located mostly in the upper mantle. It seems to be \nassociated with the tectonic inversion of extensional rift basins and to the \ntransition between different lithospheric/rheological domains. Even though \ncrustal tectonics is well imaged in the seismic profiles and in the bathymetry it \nshows low to inexistent seismic activity. This may be explained by the fact that \nthin-skinned (crustal) thrusts root on sub-horizontal d\u00e9collements associated \nwith aseismic serpentinization levels and co-seismically slip only during large \nmagnitude events, remaining locked or slip aseismically for most of the inter-\nseismic cycle. We thus speculate that high magnitude earthquakes also \nnucleate in the lithospheric mantle and then propagate into the crust across the \nserpentinized layer. \n\nKeywords: Nubia-Iberia plate boundary; micro-seismicity; serpentinization; \nneotectonics; aseismic slip; high-magnitude earthquakes \n\n\n\nIV.

Introduction  \n\nThe Gulf of Cadiz is located in the eastern termination of the Azores-Gibraltar \nplate boundary between Africa and Eurasia, west of the Gibraltar arc (Fig. \nIV.1A). Here the plate boundary is known to be diffuse, whereas the \ndeformation is partitioned along several discrete structures (e.g. Terrinha et al., \n2009; Fig. IV.1B). The seismicity is characterized by scattered events of low to \nintermediate magnitude (Fig. IV.1C and Table IV.1), occasionally with high \nmagnitude earthquakes. An example is the 1st of November 1755 Great Lisbon \nearthquake that had an estimated magnitude of 8.7 (Johnston, 1996) that \nproduced a ocean-wide tsunami with waves up to 6 meter high in Lisbon and \n10-15 meters at Cape S\u00e3o Vicente, in the Southern Portuguese coast (Baptista \nand Miranda, 2009). In the instrumental record, the most significant event was \nthe 28th February of 1969 with a Ms ? 7.9 (Fukao, 1973, Fig. IV.1C and Table \nIV.1), which generated a small tsunami recorded in several tide-gauges \nreaching a maximum amplitude of 0.6 m in Casablanca (Baptista et al., 2009 \nand references therein).  \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate boundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n202 \n \n\n\n\nIV.

C- Instrumental seismicity from 2000-2015 (recorded by the Instituto Portugu\u00eas do Mar e \nda Atmosfera seismic network) and the highest magnitude instrumental events coincident with \nNEAREST deployment area (from Buforn et al.,1988, Stich et al., 2010 and Cust\u00f3dio et al., \n2016) on top of the main tectonic structures in the Gulf of Cadiz. \n\nIn the last decades, research projects concerning the investigation of the \nseismogenic and tsunamigenic sources in the area favored the densification of \nbathymetry and near-vertical reflection, wide-angle reflection and refraction \nseismic coverage. This effort resulted in a remarkable increase of our \nunderstanding of the Gulf of Cadiz tectonic structures and associated activity. \nNotwithstanding, there is still a poor correlation between the seismicity and the \nidentified active faults as illustrated in Figs. IV.1B-C. An example is the \nuncertainty about the source of the 28th February 1969 earthquake. The focal \nmechanism solution (FMs) shows reverse kinematics, but some authors favour \nan east-west striking fault plane (e.g Buforn et al., 1988) whereas others choose \na N550E striking fault plane (e.g Fukao, 1973), parallel to the striking of the \nGorringe Bank (Figs. IV.1B-C). Moreover, following the empirical laws for fault \nmodels in the Gulf of Cadiz lithosphere proposed by Matias et al. (2013), it \nwould be expected that a MW=7.8 event would produce a rupture area of ?3,410 \nkm2, with a length of 64 km and a width of 53 km. However, there is no \nagreement to which is the tectonic structure that caused the 1969 event (see \nFig. IV.1B-C). \n\nMore recently, the moment tensor inversion of the 12th February 2007 Mw=6.0 \nevent showed a thrust kinematics with a small strike-slip component (USGS \nsource). The preferred fault plane orientations are discussed in Stich et al. \n(2007) and Cust\u00f3dio et al. (2012) but they reached contradictory results. Stich \net al. (2007) suggested an ENE-WSW solution, sub-parallel to the Horseshoe \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n204 \n \n\nFault (Fig. IV.1B-C). However, the selected plane is located 20 km to east of the \nHorseshoe fault and dipping in the opposite direction to the fault, down to a \ndepth of 40 km. On the other hand, Cust\u00f3dio et al. (2012) proposed a WNW -\nESE solution, sub-parallel to the SWIM strike-slip faults (see Fig. IV. 1B for \nlocation) dipping 46\u00ba to the SW. Both Matias et al. (2013) fault model \nformulation and Stich et al, (2007) calculations report a rupture area of ?54 km2 \nwith a length of ? 8.2 km and a width of 6.5 km. Even though this event had its \nsource near known major active tectonic structures, none of these structures \nseems to be compatible with the proposed fault plane solutions. \n\nOne of the main restrictions in finding a cause-effect relationship between \nseismicity and associated tectonic faults results from the limited geographic and \nasymmetric distribution of the permanent seismic land networks used for \nearthquakes\u2019 location around the Gulf of Cadiz. These leads to high azimuthal \ngaps resulting in lower accuracy in hypocentre determination. A key goal of the \nNEAREST project (Integrated observation from NEAR shore sourcES of \nTsunamis: towards an early warning system) was to improve the location of the \nseismogenic and tsunamigenic sources in the Gulf of Cadiz. In order to \nguaranty a better accuracy of the recorded seismicity, 24 ocean-bottom \nseismometers (LOBSTER- Long term Ocean Bottom Seismometer for Tsunami \nand Earthquake Research) and a multi-parametric station \u2013 GEOSTAR were \ndeployed in this area to record seismic events for nearly one year (Carrara et \nal., 2008).  \n\nIn the present work we will address the following questions: I) How micro-\nseismicity is distributed in the Gulf of Cadiz area; II) What are the relations \nbetween the rheology, tectonic and micro-seismicity distribution? III) Is there \nany spatial relationship between high and low magnitude seismicity? IV) Can \nmicro-seismicity studies provide us with a new insight on the seismogenic and \ntsunamigenic faults in the study area? \n\nOur study is based on the processing and analysis of the seismic data recorded \nwith the NEAREST stations and by the permanent land stations network (from \nInstituto Portugu\u00eas do Mar e da Atmosfera - IPMA and Instituto Dom Luiz - IDL) \ncombined with processing of original multichannel seismic (MCS) reflection \nprofiles and the re-interpretation/integration of published MCS and refraction \nprofiles existing in the study area. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nIV.

Geodynamic Setting  \n\nThe Gulf of Cadiz straddles across the present day Nubia-Eurasia plate \nboundary in the Central Atlantic Ocean, off the southwest Iberia and the \nnorthwest Morocco coasts. This plate boundary is defined by a wide zone of \ndeformation comprising the WNW-ESE striking SWIM dextral strike-slip faults \nirregularly connected by major NE-SW thrust faults (Zitellini et al., 2009; Duarte \net al., 2013, Hensen et al., 2015). According to recent seismic refraction and \nreflection data, the central part of the Gulf of Cadiz is floored by oceanic \nlithosphere (Sallar\u00e8s et al., 2011; Mart\u00ednez-Loriente et al., 2014, see Fig. IV.1B). \nThis fragment of oceanic lithosphere corresponds to a narrow oceanic basin of \nthe western Alpine-Tethys (Sallar\u00e8s et al., 2011), a transtensional corridor that \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n206 \n \n\nconnected the Tethyan and the Boreal seas (Terrinha et al., 2002; Duarte et al., \n2011) probably from middle-late Jurassic. \n\nThe early continental tectonic extension in the Gulf of Cadiz region was largely \ncontrolled by late Variscan inherited NE-SW faults bounding distinct rifting \nbasins and future abyssal plains in the Southwest Iberia (Pereira and Alves, \n2013; see their Fig. IV. 2 and references therein). The southernmost of these \nfaults is the 500 km Messejana Fault zone that hosts a ~200My dolerite dyke of \nthe Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (Youbi et al., 2003) (Fig. IV. 1B). The \nS\u00e3o Vicente canyon, one of the major morphologic features of southwest Iberia \nis partially controlled by the NE-SW striking S\u00e3o Vicente Fault. \n\nIn the Horseshoe Abyssal plain, the transition between the North Atlantic from \nWestern Tethys Jurassic basins is delineated by the Horseshoe Abyssal plain \nfault (HAT - Mart\u00ednez-Loriente et al., 2014, Fig. IV. 1B). The HAT separates a \nband of exhumed serpentinized continental mantle, extending to the Gorringe \nBank and Tagus Abyssal Plain, from the Western Tethyan Basin, formed during \nthe early opening of the North Atlantic that initiated in the late Jurassic (Sallar\u00e8s \net al., 2013). This interpretation is in agreement with the early Purdy (1975) \nrefraction data results that showed upper mantle velocities of 7.2\u20137.4 km/s and \nwith the tectonic interpretation of MCS images by Rovere et al. (2004). Between \nrifting episodes, the Gulf of Cadiz area was marked by several inversion \nepisodes, well described in the onshore Algarve basin, in the lower Jurassic, \nmiddle Jurassic to upper Jurassic transition and upper Jurassic to early \nCretaceous (Terrinha et al., 2002). According to Terrinha et al. (2002), thermal \nsubsiding episodes, local inversion of the oblique transtensional tectonics and \nridge push are pointed-out as possible combined geodynamic mechanisms to \nexplain these transient phases.  \n\nFrom late Cretaceous-Paleogene the convergence between Africa and Iberia \nwas accommodated by the inversion of the extensional Mesozoic fabric (Roque, \n2007, Duarte et al, 2009; Terrinha et al., 2009). During this period an \naccretionary wedge (or thrust belt) was formed that extended from Gibraltar \nacross the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain (Terrinha et al, 2009).  \n\nFrom SE Iberia to the western Alps, the N-S convergence was accommodated \nin a subduction zone that consumed most of the Alpine-Tethys oceanic domain. \nIn the Oligocene, the convergence of between Africa and Eurasia slowed down \ntriggering the initiation of a southeast-directed subduction rollback (Rosenbaum \net al., 2004 and references therein). Lonergan and White (1997) and Gutscher \net al. (2002, 2006, 2012) showed how this subduction-arc-system evolved into \nan east-dipping subduction zone below the Gibraltar Arc down to ~700km in \ndepth based on seismic tomography. Deep seismic reflection profiles showed \nthe presence of an accretionary wedge (GCAW-Fig. IV. 1B) consisting of a pile \nof SW-verging thrust faults rooting in a NE-dipping d\u00e9collement under the \nGibraltar Arc. These are two of the most solid evidences for the existence of this \n\n\n\nIV. Micro-seismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz. Is there a link between  \nmicro-seismicity, high magnitude earthquakes and active faults? \n\n \n\n207 \n \n\nsubduction zone, even though its present day activity is still disputed (e.g., \nZitellini et al., 2009; Duarte et al., 2013).  \n\nA new tectonic map based on re-interpretation of the main active faults resulted \nin the idea that an incipient subduction zone may be forming and propagating \nalong the Western Iberia, marked by a set of compressive structures (the \nGorringe, Horseshoe and Marques de Pombal thrust faults, Duarte et al., 2013). \nThe tectonic reactivation of this passive margin would be the result of the \npropagation of stresses from the fading Gibraltar subduction zone and stresses \nrelated to the large-scale convergence between Africa and Eurasia (Duarte et \nal., 2013; Terrinha et al., 2009).  \n\nAccording to Zitellini et al (2009), the SWIM Faults, a 600 km long, 80 km wide \nband of WNW-ESE dextral strike-slip faults (Fig. IV. 1B) is the precursor of a \nnew transcurrent plate boundary connecting the Gloria Fault to the Rif-Tell Fault \nZone. However, Cunha et al. (2012) investigated the neotectonics of the Gulf \nCadiz using a thin-shell modeling approach for the region and conclude that \nmodels dominated by continuous 600km SWIM faults would absorb all the \nseismic strain and would not reproduce the deformation along the NE-SW thrust \nsystem (e.g Horseshoe and Gorringe Faults). Notwithstanding, the SWIM faults \n(continuous or discontinuous) appear to connect the two main compressive \nfronts in the region, the Gibraltar arc and the SW Iberia thrust system, acting as \na major lithospheric transfer zone (Duarte et al., 2013). Neres et al. (2016) \nusing the same numerical approach favored the existence of an independent \nAlboran plate overriding the Gibraltar subducted slab. \n\nPresent day kinematic models for the Eurasia (Iberia) \u2013 Africa (Nubia) plate \nboundary estimate a convergence rate of 4-5 mm/yr, with an approximate \nWNW-ESE to NW-SE horizontal motion (Fig. IV.1, Argus et al., 1989, DeMets et \nal., 1994, Nocquet and Calais, 2004, Calais et al., 2003, Fernandes et al., 2003, \nStich et al., 2006 and Serpelloni et al., 2007) compatible with the SWIM faults \ndextral strike-slip kinematics. The average maximum horizontal compression \n(SHmax) is oriented NW-SE as defined by borehole, focal mechanisms and \nmoment tensor analysis (Fig. IV.1, Ribeiro et al. 1996, Borges et al., 2001, Stich \net al., 2006 and Heidbach et al, 2008). Preliminary tensor analysis based on 36 \nevents recorded in NEAREST OBS network (Geissler et al., 2010) retrieved a \nroughly NNW-SSE, maximum horizontal compression in the Horseshoe Abyssal \nplain and nearly NW-SE in the S\u00e3o Vicente canyon, consistent with previous \nsolutions for moderate to large earthquakes.  \n\nIV.4. Data and Methods \n\nIV.4.1. Microseismicity data acquisition and processing  \n\nThe NEAREST network consisted in 24 broadband OBSs (Ocean Bottom \nSeismometers) from the German DEPAS pool (Deutscher Ger\u00e4te-Pool f\u00fcr \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n208 \n \n\namphibische Seismologie / German instrument pool for amphibian seismology) \nand a multiparametric station GEOSTAR from INGV (Istituto Nazionale di \nGeofisica e Vulcanologia). Both the OBSs and the GEOSTAR were equipped \nwith G\u00fcralp CMG-40T broadband seismometers and High-tech HTI-04-OBS \nPCA/ULF and OAS DC- 50 Hz hydrophones, respectively (see Fig. IV. 1B for \nlocations). The instruments were deployed in August 2007 and acquired data \ncontinuously for 11 months, with a sampling rate of 100Hz recording \nteleseismic, regional and local events. All stations were operational during at \nleast 8 months. The clocks were synchronized with GPS time before \ndeployment and after recovering. The internal clock drifts in the operational \nstations were corrected by using a linear interpolation method.  \n\nThe events were extracted from a continuous waveform data set using both an \nautomatic REF-TEK trigger algorithm, short-time-average through long-time-\naverage (STA/LTA), and by visual inspection of daily spectrograms from the \nvertical seismometer component. After extracting the events, we performed a \npreliminary quality check based on the consistency of the P and S waves \narrivals recognized in the different stations. 767 events out of the identified 1357 \nevents were considered to be of high to medium quality and could therefore be \nlocated. From the overall extracted events, 364 were also detected with the \nPortuguese land stations network (from the Instituto Portugu\u00eas do Mar e da \nAtmosfera-IPMA and the Instituto Dom Luiz-IDL). However, 58 of these events \nwere only recorded in land permanent stations but not in the NEAREST \nstations. These earthquakes were located outside or at the limit of the \ndeployment area and near the Portuguese South coast (mostly in the \nGuadalquivir Bank region; See Fig. IV. 1B). \n\nThe data analysis was carried out using the SEISAN 9.0.1 Seismic Analysis \npackage (Havskov and Ottem\u00f6ller, 2011). All the events were picked and \nweighted manually for P and S waves\u2019 first arrivals, generally in the three \ncomponents seismometer and in the unfiltered signal. The hydrophone was \nused only as alternative for P wave picking and polarity confirmations.  \n\nFor preliminary earthquake location and magnitude estimation was used the \nHYP2, a modified version of HYPOCENTER of Lienert (1994) to include \nindependent S delays. We started by adopting the same velocity model used in \nGeissler et al. (2010) but in addition we tested other models constrained by \nwide-angle seismic reflection and refraction data from Sall\u00e0res et al. (2011, \n2013) and Mart\u00ednez-Loriente et al. (2014). For each event, depth was checked \nusing a systematic RMS (root mean square) misfit -depth search approach \n(Havskov and Ottem\u00f6ller, 2011). The selected solution was the one with the \nlowest misfit.  \n\nFor local magnitude (ML) estimation it was used Carrilho and Vales (2009) \nformulation for Portugal and adjacent areas: \n\n\n\nIV. Micro-seismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz. Is there a link between  \nmicro-seismicity, high magnitude earthquakes and active faults? \n\n \n\n209 \n \n\n= + 1.287 ? + 0.00061? ? 2.147 \n\nWhere A is the amplitude measured in a Wood- Anderson synthetic display (in \nnm) and ? is the hypocentral distance. This is the same formulation applied in \nand in routine geophysical observation at the IPMA Seismological Operational \nCentre.  \n\nTo improve events locations, we used the VELEST algorithm to simultaneous \ninvert hypocenters locations; stations corrections and the velocity model (see \ndetails on the method in Kissiling, 1995). To determine an accurate minimum \n1D-velocity, it is recommended to use well-located events with observational \nazimuthal gaps lower than 180\u00b0 and at least 10 P wave picks (Husen et al.,. \n1999). As input, it is also suggested to use a minimum sample of 500 well \nlocated events. For the present case study, we have only 443 events in the \ndeployment area. From those, few match the desired parameters. So, we \nconsidered less restrictive conditions as previously assumed by e.g. Carrilho et \nal. (2004) or Ruiz et al. (2011). The final selection included 269 events with an \nRMS misfit of 0.281s, with a total number of P- and S- phase observations \ngreater than 10, an azimuthal gap lower than 210\u00ba (the averaged GAP was \n112\u00ba) and a minimum of 3 P-wave first arrival observations (phase readings are \ndominated by S-wave pickings due to dominant poor to fair S/N in locations with \na thick sedimentary cover). One of the main constraints in using a 1D velocity \nmodel to determine earthquakes location in the Gulf of Cadiz is the diversity of \ncrustal and upper mantle domains. Adding station delays to the velocity model \nhelps to correct for subsurface geological variations below the recording \nstations. Finally, we re-located all events using the initial HYP2 application and \nthe velocity model resulted from VELEST application. Note that HYP2 \napplication allows the use of both independent Vp, Vs models (variable Vp/Vs) \nand P, S stations delays. \n\nThe FMs were derived from P wave first motion polarity both from the \nNEAREST network stations (BB OBS and GEOSTAR) and from the land \nstations (see Fig. IV. 1B). FMs were computed using the double-couple fault-\nplane solution program - FPFIT (Reasenberg and Oppenheimer, 1985). The \nminimum criterion for trying a solution was 10 polarities readings and a quality \nclassification was determined based on polarity misfits and on the standard \ndeviation parameters computed with FPFIT for each solution (quality \nparameters in table III. 11, in the previous subchapter III.4.2 and a display of all \nfocal mechanism solutions is presented in detail in the appendix III and IV.A-D).  \n\nWe used the Focal Mechanism Stress Inversion (FMSI, Gephart and Forsyth, \n1984) package to derive the best stress tensor that explains the FMs \ndetermined in studied area. We restricted our data to the FMs recovered from \nNEAREST OBS experiment and analyzed in this work. Fault plane solutions \npublished in previous works were based on land network records only, which \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n210 \n \n\nare intrinsically poorly constrained, particularly if low to intermediate magnitude \nseismicity was used. Conversely, better constrained higher magnitude events \nmay express a regional stress tensor rather than a local complex interaction of \nrupture mechanisms that may be associated with the micro-seismicity.  \n\nThe FMSI retrieves the orientation of the ?1, ?2, ?3 and a stress magnitude \nparameter, R= (?2-?1)/(?3-?1). These results were used to compute SHmax and \nthe dominant stress regime in each area. We followed the World Stress Map \nProject guidelines for formal stress inversions of focal mechanisms. \nAccordingly, we used the formulation in Lund and Townend (2007) for SH-\ndetermination and in Zoback (1992) for dominant stress regime determinations. \n\nIV.4.2.Multichannel seismic reflection and refraction profiles \n\nThe multichannel seismic reflection (MCS) and refraction profiles studied in this \nwork were selected specifically to support geological and rheological \nunderstanding of the results retrieved from passive seismic experiment. \nAccordingly, all the selected MCS profiles, except for IAM-GB1, are depth \nsections which allowed a correlation between the tectonic fabric and seismicity \ndistribution. The chosen profiles and references are presented in Fig. IV. 1B. \n\nThe Seismic profile IAM-GB1 was selected for depth conversion because it \nstrikes perpendicularly to the southern cluster of hypocenters in Geissler et al. \n(2010) and to the boundary between the Central Atlantic Ocean Northern limit \n(Mart\u00ednez et al., 2014). Therefore, we could expect to have a clear image of the \ncrustal structure and its relation to the micro-seismicity (Fig. IV.10). Details on \nthe acquisition parameters and processing sequence are presented in the next \nsection.  \n\nIV.4.2.1.Acquisition parameters and processing sequence of multichannel \nseismic \n\nIAM-GB1 profile (see Fig. IV. 1B for location) was acquired during the Iberian \nAtlantic Margins (IAM) project funded by the European Community project \nJOU2-CT92-0177 (Banda et al., 1995). The energy source was a SWAG air-\ngun array with a total energy volume of 7524 cu. in. The source depth was 10 m \nand the shot interval 75 m. The receivers were contained in a streamer with 192 \ngroups with an interval of 25 m, with five auxiliary channels. The streamer was \nat a depth of 18 m. The sample rate was 4 ms and the record length 25 s. A \nhigh-cut filter at 92 Hz with a slope of 72 dB/oct and a constant gain of 24dB \nwere applied during acquisition. No low-cut filter was applied. The primary \nnavigation system was a Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS). \n\nSeismic reflection profile IAM-GB1 was re-processed in order to obtain a clearer \nimage of the basement structure across the SWIM faults and the Central \nAtlantic-Tethys Oceanic boundaries proposed by Mart\u00ednez-Loriente et al. \n(2014). The IAM-GB1 seismic profile re-processing was performed using the \n\n\n\nIV. Micro-seismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz. Is there a link between  \nmicro-seismicity, high magnitude earthquakes and active faults? \n\n \n\n211 \n \n\nsoftware Globe Claritas from GNS Science, a package for 2D and 3D land and \nmarine seismic data. The processing sequence was trace mute, in-line \ngeometry; trace editing, brute stack, velocity analysis, 2-window statistical \ndeconvolution, stacking, time and space variant bandpass filtering, time and \nspace velocity variant finite differences time migration and post-migration depth \nconversion, using a geologically meaningful velocity model. The velocity model \nused in the depth conversion was defined by picking several major horizons in \nthe time migration. Subsequently, velocities were assigned to the different \nlayers bounded by horizons. Velocities were extracted from refraction and wide-\nangle reflection seismic profile - P1 (Mart\u00ednez-Loriente et al., 2014) acquired \nalso under the scope of the NEAREST project (see Fig. IV. 1B for locations). \nWe used interval velocities from 1800 m/s at the uppermost sediments to 4700 \nm/s at their base. Three layers were defined for the crustal basement velocities \nwith velocities of 5800 m/s and, 6300 m/s and the lowermost layer with 7200 \nm/s. \n\nIV.5. Results \n\nIV.5.1.Seismological analysis \n\nIV.5.1.1. Velocity model and stations corrections \n\nThe velocity model shown in Fig. IV. 2 is the best fit 1D velocity model that \ncomplies with P and S observations for the 269 investigated events (out of 443 \nevents). The derivation of this velocity model included the computation of P and \nS stations corrections. The positive and negative corrections coincide with \nhigher and lower sediment thickness, respectively, indicating a good \ncorrespondence between the model and sub-surface geology (see subchapter \nIII.3.2.5).  \n\nHowever, since the NEAREST OBS deployment area is described as a region \ncomprising different lithospheric domains as old Jurassic oceanic, thinned \ncontinental lithosphere and exhumed serpentinized mantle (Sallar\u00e8s et al., \n2011, Gonzalez et al., 1996, Sallar\u00e8s et al., 2013 and Mart\u00ednez-Loriente, 2014) \nour velocity model can be viewed as a mean representative value of the \nlithospheric structure of the study area.  \n\nIf we compare P-minimum velocity model (Fig. IV.2A) with the refraction and \nwide-angle reflection data in the Gulf of Cadiz area, we observe that for the \nsediments layers the velocities are higher. Both in Sallar\u00e8s et al. (2011) and \nMart\u00ednez \u2013Loriente (2014) velocity solutions range from 1.8 to to 4.0 km/s for \nthe upper and lower layers, respectively. In our velocity model, in the upper \nlayer Vp is 3.3 km/s and in the lower layer Vp is 3.6 km/s. We recall that for \nearthquakes location we replace layers resulting from gradient velocities \n(refraction data) with interval velocities layers. This will explain partially the \ndifferences here reported for velocities values. Also, we knew that during the \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n212 \n \n\nderivation of the final models, the velocities in these layers were poorly \nconstrained because few hypocenters occurred at these depths.  \n\nCrustal velocities range from 5.18 km/s to 7.08 km/s are slightly higher than the \nresults from NEAREST refraction profile P2 (Sallar\u00e8s et al., 2011) ranging from \n4.6\u20134.8 km/s at the top to 6.9\u20137.1 km/s at the base. The transition between \nlower crust and upper mantle is ?16km in depth. The Moho depth is in \nconformity with the results published in Sallar\u00e8s et al. (2011). The uppermost \npart of the lithospheric mantle (16 to 22 km) yielded Vp in the range of 7.6 to 7.8 \nkm/s and high Vp/Vs ratios (Fig. IV.2B) is compatible with hydrated mantle \n(Christensen, 2004). In Fig. IV. 2C, we established a general compositional \nmodel based on the computed Vp and comparison with previous seismic \nrefraction results in the area. \n\n \nFigure IV.2 Final velocity model and depth distribution of the hypocenters recorded during the \nNEAREST experiment. A-Final P and S velocity model resulting from simultaneous inversion of \nhypocenter location, stations corrections and velocity model using VELEST algorithm.

Note that the depth scale refers to the sea level.  \n\nIV.5.1.2.Seismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\nThe NEAREST Network experiment allowed for better constrained earthquake \nlocations in the Gulf of Cadiz area. Previous earthquake\u2019s detection and \nlocation were made using land station networks only, with restricted and \nasymmetric geographical distributions. This resulted in a limited control of the \noffshore seismic activity. Geissler et al. (2010) previous study, using a selection \n\n\n\nIV. Micro-seismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz. Is there a link between  \nmicro-seismicity, high magnitude earthquakes and active faults? \n\n \n\n213 \n \n\nof 36 events of the NEAREST network, showed the importance of using OBS \nnetworks to obtain more accurate hypocenter locations in this area.  \n\nThe present work reports the final results from the NEAREST OBS experiment \nthat include 443 events identified in more than 6 stations within the deployment \narea. The root mean square travel time residuals is 0.275s. The mean errors for \nlongitude, latitude and depth are 2.6 km, 3.7 km and 6.8 km, respectively. A key \nfinding is that 84% of the seismicity occurs at depths between 25 and 50 km, \nwithin unaltered lithospheric mantle (Figs. IV. 2 -3).  \n\nThe seismicity recorded in the NEAREST network included local magnitudes \nranging from 1.1 to 4.8. The highest magnitude earthquake (with ML= 4.8) \noccurred in the S\u00e3o Vicente Canyon at 00:21 a.m. on the 11st of January, 2008. \n\nVisual inspection of the hypocenters distribution in Fig. IV. 3 shows three well \ndefined clusters: i) a northern cluster, in the area of the S\u00e3o Vicente Canyon, ii) \na western cluster, in the Gorringe Bank, and iii) a southern cluster, at the SW \ntermination of the Horseshoe Fault. In addition to these clusters, scattered \nseismicity was recorded in the areas of the Guadalquivir Bank, Portim\u00e3o Bank, \nCoral Patch Ridge and Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge (see Fig. IV. 3). Some \nregional and teleseismic events were also recorded but they are not analyzed in \nthis work (for more details see Monna et al., 2013). \n\nWe observe that the S\u00e3o Vicente and Gorringe clusters are elongated along \nNNE-SSW to NE-SW directions, respectively, sub-parallel to active thrust faults. \nIn the case of the S\u00e3o Vicente cluster, seismicity extends from the footwall of \nthe Horseshoe Fault to the NE along the S\u00e3o Vicente Fault. The Gorringe \ncluster strikes parallel to the main NE-striking thrust fault that marks the NW \nlimit of this submarine relief. Unlike the other clusters, the Horseshoe cluster \nhas a WNW-ESE to NW-SE strike, slightly clockwise rotated with respect to the \nSWIM faults. The Guadalquivir Bank was previously described as an area of \ndense seismic activity (e.g. Buforn et al, 2004, Cust\u00f3dio et al., 2015), but few \nearthquakes were identified in this work, probably because it was outside the \nNEAREST network. It is worthwhile to note that some well-constrained events \nwere recorded in the Portim\u00e3o Bank and in the northwestern part of the \naccretionary wedge, which are located at the limit of the deployment area.  \n\nThe analysis of the NEAREST OBS data resulted in the determination of 124 \nfocal mechanisms, 82 of which were considered well defined with magnitudes \nranging between 1.9 and 4.8 (see focal mechanism solution in Fig. IV. 4 and \ndetails on Appendix III and IV.A-D), i.e. we added 58 new solutions to previous \ncatalogues and synthesis (Geissler et al., 2010, Stich et al., 2010, Domingues \net al., 2013, Cust\u00f3dio et al., 2016). Because we considered events with at least \n10 polarities, two events from Geissler et al. (2010) catalogue are not included \nin our (events 5th and 21st of March 2008, with 9 polarities, in the southern \ncluster in Fig. IV. 3 of the referenced work). In addition, three other solutions in \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n214 \n \n\nGeissler at al. (2010) were revised and evaluated as poorly constrained and \nthus were excluded from our catalogue (the 22nd of May 2008 in the southern \ncluster and outside the clusters area and both the 6th and the 7th of November \n2007, ibid). \n\n \nFigure IV.3-Seismicity results from NEAREST deployment experiment. We identified three \nclusters: Blue events were defined as the S\u00e3o Vicente cluster, red circles mark the Gorringe \ncluster and purple events define the Horseshoe cluster. The remaining circles in green mark the \nevents located outside the clusters. AB- plot of all events in a NW-SE cross-section along the \nSH-max (Ribeiro et al. 1996, Borges et al., 2001, Stich et al., 2006 and Heidbach et al, 2008), \nblack bars show vertical errors) and; CD- plot along a perpendicular cross-section.

Is there a link between  \nmicro-seismicity, high magnitude earthquakes and active faults? \n\n \n\n215 \n \n\n \nFigure IV.4 FMs obtained from the NEAREST network experiment (details on FMs are provided \nin Appendix III and IV.A-D). The results here presented add 58 new focal mechanisms to the \nprevious catalogue in Geissler et al. (2010). Note that apart from the diversity of FMs, the \npredominant fault solutions are reverse dip-slip and strike-slip solutions with a few normal dip-\nslip. \n\nIn the Gorringe cluster, 31 FMs were computed (Fig. IV. 4, details on the events \nin Appendix III.A and IV_A). These new solutions are a substantial addition to \nthe previous catalogues, where few FMs were known, particularly within the \nmagnitude range of the NEAREST experiment (see Fig. IV. 1C, information \nfrom e.g. Grimison and Chen, 1986; Buforn et al., 2004, Stich et al, 2010 and \nCust\u00f3dio et al., 2016). In the Horseshoe cluster, 26 fault plane solutions were \nobtained (Fig. IV. 4, details on the events in Appendix III.B and IV_B) with 10 \nevents common to Geissler et al. (2010). We identified 33 FMs in the S\u00e3o \nVicente Cluster (Fig. IV. 4, details on the events in Appendix III.C and IV_C) \nadding 17 new events to the previous dataset. We obtained some discrepancies \nin relation to the Geissler et al. (2010) events, mostly resulting from adding new \npolarities to their preliminary solutions.   \n\nOutside the clusters areas, particularly in the area of the Gulf of Cadiz \nAccretionary Wedge (GCAW) we computed few FMs (see Fig. IV.4 and details \non the events in Appendix III.D and IV_D). In the GCAW we obtained some \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n216 \n \n\nnearly reverse dip-slip FMs (events 109, 111 and 112). Near the SWIM 2 fault, it \nwas computed two pure strike-slip FMs (events 122 and 123). At the lower limit \nof the Portim\u00e3o bank, we also computed a reverse dip-slip FMs (event 108). All \nthese events are located between ?30 and 40 km in depth. Since these FMs are \nlocated outside or in the limit of the NEAREST network, we will not discuss the \nsource mechanism of these events.  \n\nIn general, the predominant fault-plane solutions are reverse dip-slip and strike-\nslip solutions. These results are in agreement with the preliminary solutions \npublished in Geissler et al. (2010) based on the best events reported from the \nNEAREST experiment. They are also consistent with previous studies carried \nout in this area for moderate to large earthquakes (e.g. Grimison and Chen, \n1986; Buforn et al., 2004; Stich et al., 2010, Custodio et al., 2016). \nNotwithstanding, some normal dip-slip solutions were identified in the upper \nmantle, as already reported in Stich et al. (2010) and Geissler et al. (2010). The \ndiversity of the FMs reflects the complexity of the source mechanisms of this \nlow to intermediate magnitude seismicity. We cannot find a dominant fault \nmechanism or common fault plane for any of the clusters investigated. \n\nDuring the NEAREST experiment 291 events were recorded and located by the \npermanent land network in the area of the OBS deployment (data provided by \nIPMA). From these, only 179 events were recorded and located by both \nnetworks. If we compare the epicenter distribution obtained from the two \nnetworks, we observe that most of the locations using the land stations are \noffset landwards (Fig. IV. 5). Most of the events are displaced between 0.1 and \n0.3 degrees in latitude and longitude and 20 to 30 km in depth. In what regards \nthe depth distribution, the locations based on the land network are \nsystematically shallower than the NEAREST OBS solutions, with differences \nreaching up to 60 km (Fig. IV. 5). Sub-horizontal alignments around depths of \n15 km and 30 km that were detected using the land network were not imaged \nby the NEAREST network. These alignments are probably artifacts produced by \nmanually fixing earthquake\u2019s depths (which is typically done for poorly \nconstrained events). \n\nFinally, if we compare magnitudes estimations most events (98%) recorded by \nthe land network are systematically underestimated (note that we used the \nsame formulation for magnitude estimation as IPMA). Differences in magnitude \nvary between -0,1 and 1,0; however, in 83% of the events the underestimation \nby the land network is between 0,2-0,6, only. All these differences highlight the \nlimitations of the land stations distribution and of the velocity models. Moreover, \nit outlines the necessity of using better stations distribution for the location of \nearthquakes in the Gulf of Cadiz region, in particular in what concerns low to \nintermediate magnitude events. A new strategy for the location of these events \nby the land networks should be developed in the light of the results obtained in \nthis study. \n\n\n\nIV. Micro-seismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz.

It is possible to observe that the \nhypocentres located by the land stations are biased towards land and shallow depths. The black \narrows mark the directions of the profiles also shown in the figure (N-S on the right and W-E on \nthe bottom); the black triangles are the seismic stations location. \n\nIn the next sections, we will describe in detail the seismicity in the three \nclusters. We describe our results based on our observations in map view and in \ncross-sections. In both displays, we present the crustal-upper mantle transitions \nin the area. Note that these limits are speculated based on the available \ndiscontinuous geophysical data (refraction and wide angle reflection profiles, \nsee references in Fig. IV.1B). In particular, we should point out that the layer \nwith serpentinized mantle is drawn based on previous evidences for low upper \nmantle velocities down to ?20km (down to 14 km in refraction profile B-BR from \nPurdy, 1975 and ?20 km in MCS reflection profile IAM-03 from Gonzalez et al., \n1996 as well as in NEAREST refraction profiles P2 and P1 from Sallar\u00e8s et al., \n2011 and Mart\u00ednez-Loriente et al., 2014, see profiles location in Fig. IV. 1B). \nFurthermore, the serpentinization layer should be discontinuous; the geometry \nshown in the cross-sections is a simplification. Finally, we will also look in detail \nto the fault plane solutions in each cluster, the best fitting stress tensor, \nresulting maximum horizontal stress and general stress regime characterization \n(a resume in Table IV.2). \n\n \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n218 \n \n\nTable IV.2- Best fitting stress tensor details (grey highlighted rows show the preferred stress \ntensors for each cluster).

Here the seismicity is \nasymmetric with a higher number of events concentrated to the southwest (see \nmap and profiles PRF01-03 in Fig. IV. 6). In profile PRF02, we observe that the \nevents distribution is diffuse (Fig. IV. 6C) while to the NE it becomes \nprogressively more discrete, defining roughly a SE dipping alignment with a flat-\nramp geometry (see profile PRF01 Fig. IV. 6B). The longitudinal profile PRF03 \n(Fig. IV. 6D) also shows a variation in the clustering pattern of the events. In this \ncase, they are slightly more disperse to the SW. Below the Ormonde seamount, \nthere is an alignment that plunges to the NE, towards the thinned continental \ndomain (Fig. IV. 6D). The transition between the two sub-clusters is marked by \na possible steep boundary (see profile PRF03 in Fig. IV. 6D).  \n\nIn the Gorringe cluster, the dominant FMs are strike \u2013slip and reverse dip-slip \nwith a few normal fault events. In map view, it seems that pure-strike slip \nmechanisms are mostly located in the SW and NE limit of the Gorringe cluster, \nwhile reverse (and oblique) slip are found in the central part of the cluster, sub-\nparallel to the Gorringe fault.  \n\n\n\nIV. Micro-seismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz. Is there a link between  \nmicro-seismicity, high magnitude earthquakes and active faults? \n\n \n\n219 \n \n\n \nFigure IV.6- The Gorringe cluster. A. Map view with the epicenter distribution and FMs. We \nrecognized that events roughly define a NE-SW alignment. Epicenter locations are asymmetric \nwith more events to the SW. In NE and SW sub-clusters, SHmax is roughly NNW-SSE and sub-\nparallel to ?1 trend (The background colors define the lithospheric limits in Fig. IV. 1B, details on \nthe tensor and SHmax in Table IV.2). B-D- Cross-sections and bathymetric profiles across the \nseismicity cluster (bathymetric profiles with a vertical exaggeration of ? 2.5\u00d7 and all the profiles \nare a projection of the earthquakes located within a 40 km wide band). B-C: NW-SE cross-\nsections are plotted in the profiles PRF-01 and PRF-02. In profile PRF-01, the seismicity is more \ndiffuse while to NNE, in the profile PRF-02, it becomes more discrete and defines a flat-ramp \ngeometry (faults geometry in the cross-sections based Mart\u00ednez \u2013Loriente et al., 2013). D. \nProfile PRF-03 shows a SW-NE cross-section drawn along the cluster elongation (TCC- \nThinned Continental Crust). In this profile, we identify a sub-vertical limit at 60 km from the origin \n(dash-dot). \n\nWe computed the best fitting stress tensor (see Table IV.2), for the determined \nFMs, using the FMSI package (Gephart and Forsyth, 1984). Initially, we \nincluded all the best focal mechanism solution and subsequently improved the \ndataset by excluding events that were inconsistent with the best tensor solution. \nWe started with 16 FMs and an average rotational misfit of 7.95\u00b0 and concluded \nwith 14 FMs and an average rotational misfit of 4.40\u00b0.In the next step, we \nsubdivided the original focal mechanisms dataset in two sub-groups. This \napproach is coherent with our observations that seismicity distribution along the \nGorringe cluster is asymmetric. We defined our final stress tensors for the NE \nand SW sub-clusters based on 6 and 7 events with improved average rotational \nmisfits of 1.55\u00ba and 2.30\u00ba, respectively. The ?1 orientation is ? NNW-SSE, \nsimilar for both SW and NE sub-clusters, differing by approximately 10\u00ba in strike \nand dip. In the NE sub-cluster, the lowest compressive direction (?3) dips \ntowards ESE, to the thinned continental domain while in the SW sub-cluster, it \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n220 \n \n\ndips gently towards WSW. Finally, the SHmax azimuths are nearly NNW-SSE in \nboth sub-clusters. According to Zoback (1992) formulation, the Gorringe cluster \nhas a dominant strike-slip regime (see Table IV.2 and Fig. IV. 6A).  \n\nIV.5.1.4. The S\u00e3o Vicente Cluster \n\nThe S\u00e3o Vicente seismicity cluster is parallel to the S\u00e3o Vicente Canyon and \nthe S\u00e3o Vicente Fault, which terminates near the NE limit of the Horseshoe \nFault (see Figs. 1B and 7A). The profiles across the cluster long axis show that \nthe hypocentres define sub-vertical to SE-dipping trends (see profiles PRF 01 \nand 02 in Figs. 7B-C). Hypocenters in the profile PRF01 suggest the existence \nof a sub-vertical discontinuity, while to the SW, in profile PRF02, the seismicity \ndistribution displays both vertical and SE-dipping discontinuities. The lower limit \nof the seismogenic layer is at around a depth of 50 km, increasing towards the \noceanic domain where it reaches depths close to 60 km (PRF03-Fig. IV.7D). \nThe depth distribution of the micro-seismicity is in agreement with Grevemeyer \net al., (2016). \n\nThe prevailing FMs are pure strike-slip and oblique slip, combining strike-slip \nwith a small reverse dip-slip component. A few normal faults are also observed.  \n\nThe best fitting ?1 orientation is approximately NW-SE, sub-horizontal, oblique \nto the cluster elongation (Table IV.2, Fig. IV. 7). We started with an initial \ndataset of 32 events and an average misfit of 7.937\u00b0. The final dataset included \n20 events and the average misfit was 3.836\u00b0. It deviates from Geissler et al., \n(2010) preliminary results (which is nearly WNW-ESE). The main difference \nbetween this work and Geissler et al. (2010) is the dataset, as here we present \na complete catalogue for the NEAREST experiment. The additional data \nresulted in a different stress tensor model for S\u00e3o Vicente cluster. However, the \nadditional data in this work also yields a lower average rotational misfit, of 3.8\u00b0, \nwhile in Geissler et al. (2010) was 4.6\u00b0. \n\n\n\nIV. Micro-seismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz. Is there a link between  \nmicro-seismicity, high magnitude earthquakes and active faults? \n\n \n\n221 \n \n\n \nFigure IV.7- Seismicity at the S\u00e3o Vicente cluster. A. Map view with epicenter distribution and \nFMs. SHmax is roughly NW-SE and sub-parallel to ?1 striking direction and roughly \nperpendicular to epicenters NE-SW trend(The background colors define the lithospheric limits in \nFig. IV. 1B, details on the tensor and SHmax in Table IV.2)B-D- Cross-sections and bathymetric \nprofiles across the seismicity cluster (bathymetric profiles with a vertical exaggeration of ? 2.0\u00d7 \nand all the profiles are a projection of the earthquakes located within a 40 km wide band). B-C. \nWNW\u2013ESE cross-sections are shown in profiles PRF01-02. D. SSW-NNE cross-section is \npresented in profile PRF03. We observe that in profile PRF-01 the hypocenters are mostly \naligned in a sub-vertical plane while in profiles PRF-02 and PRF03 we can identify ESE and NE \ndipping planes, respectively. The profile PRF-03 is longitudinal to the cluster elongation. In this \nprofile, we recognize that the bottom boundary of the hypocentres is located around 50 km \ndepth, with rare deeper events (Fault abbreviations and background colors described in Fig. IV. \n1B). \n\nIV.5.1.5.The Horseshoe Cluster \n\nThe Horseshoe seismicity cluster displays a broad NW-SE trend in epicenter \ndistribution (Fig. IV. 8A). The profiles orthogonal to this trend show that \ndispersion is higher to the West (PRF-01, Fig. IV.8B) than in the East (PRF-02, \nFig. IV.8C). In the longitudinal profile PRF-03, we observe SE-dipping and sub-\nvertical alignments of events (Fig. IV. 8D), limited between 20 and 50km depth, \napproximately. This seismicity is distributed across three types of basement, \ntwo oceanic and one consisting of hydrated mantle. Adding to this, it should be \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n222 \n \n\nnoted that this profile cross cuts four main discontinuities, three of which are \nfirst order faults deforming the seafloor the HF, the SWIM 1 and SWIM 2. \nHypocenters laying to the south of SWIM 1 Fault follow a roughly vertical trend, \nwhilst hypocenters to the north of SWIM 1 Fault show a SE dipping trend. \n\nThe focal mechanisms solutions are mostly pure strike-slip and few reverse dip-\nslip events, with some normal faulting also. Note that in contrast with the NE-\nSW trend of seismicity, most strike-slip solutions show a fault plane striking \nWNW-ESE to W-E, sub-parallel to the SWIM faults (Fig. IV. 8A). These \nobservations are clearer in the vicinity of SWIM 1 fault to the East of the \nHorseshoe fault. To the West, FMs are more variable.  \n\nIn relation to the stress tensor inversion modeling, we started the Horseshoe \ncluster analysis with 21 the best focal mechanism solutions. The first inversion \ntest resulted in an average minimum rotation misfit of 5.96\u00b0. We removed \ninconsistent data and end up with 19 events and a misfit of 3.95\u00b0 (see Table \nIV.2). The resulting maximum compression is similar to Geissler et al. (2010) \npreliminary results for the same area (?1 with orientation 12 \u00b0, N351\u00b0E, see \nreference work). Yet, divergence is larger for the extensional axis dip that \nis?2\u00b0and R solution ?0.7 (idem) contrasting with our results, ?63\u00b0 and 0.5, \nrespectively. We consider that differences result from adding new events to \ninitial dataset in Geissler et al (2010).  \n\nTo improve our result we tested 2 sub-clusters that we consider coherent with \nour observations of FMs distributions. One sub-cluster to the East of the HF \nwhere most FMs are clearly strike \u2013slip and another to the W of this fault, where \nFMs have a more complex pattern (Fig. IV. 8A).  \n\nWe started with 14 events in the E sub-cluster and a RMS of 6.43. The final \ndataset had 12 events and an average misfit of 3.271. The maximum \ncompression is similar to the results previously reported in Geissler et al. \n(2010), roughly NNW-SSE and coincident with the SHmax direction. \n\nIn the W sub-cluster, we selected 5 events and the final error was 1.116\u00b0. The \nstress tensor for western dataset is diverges from the remaining results, with ?1 \ntrend approximately NW-SE sub-parallel to SHmax orientation. This trend is \nalso sub-parallel to the SHmax direction in the S\u00e3o Vicente cluster. \n\n\n\nIV. Micro-seismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz. Is there a link between  \nmicro-seismicity, high magnitude earthquakes and active faults? \n\n \n\n223 \n \n\n \nFigure IV.8 - Horseshoe cluster seismicity. A. Map view with epicenter distribution and FMs. \nThe events are distributed following a broad NW-SE trend. In E and W sub-clusters, SHmax is \nroughly NNW-SSE and NW-SE, respectively. These directions are sub-parallel to ?1 trends (The \nbackground colors define the lithospheric limits in Fig. IV. 1B, details on the tensor and SHmax \nin Table IV.2). B-D. Cross-sections and bathymetric profiles across the seismicity cluster \n(bathymetric profiles with a vertical exaggeration of ? 2.5\u00d7 and all the profiles are a projection of \nthe earthquakes located within a 40 km wide band). B-C. SW-NE cross-sections are shown in \nprofiles PRF01 \u2013 02 (CAOC- Central Atlantic Oceanic Crust and WTOC- Western Tethys \nOceanic Crust). In profile PRF-01, the seismicity is more diffuse while to East in profile PRF-02 \nit becomes more discrete and defines a roughly sub-vertical alignment coincident with SWIM1 \nfault. D. Profile PRF-03 shows a NW-SE cross-section along the cluster maximum elongation. \nThe hypocenters define roughly SE dipping planes; however they seem to root deeper or are \noffset from the known faults in the area (note that the events in the dashed line ellipse are \nlocated to the south of the SWIM1 fault). Fault abbreviations and background colors described \nin Fig. IV. 1B. \n\nIV.5.2. Horseshoe Abyssal Plain tectonic structure \n\nSeveral studies have already used depth converted profiles in the same areas \nwhere we identified the Gorringe and S\u00e3o Vicente seismicity clusters to \ninvestigate the crustal structure (e.g. Sartori et al., 1994, Zitellini et al., 1999 and \nJimenez \u2013Munt et al.,2010 and Sallar\u00e8s et al., 2013). However, this was never \nattempted in the area of the Horseshoe cluster. This cluster straddles across \nvarious types of oceanic basement as derived from palinspastic reconstructions \nand seismic refraction models (Fig. IV. 1B). The processing, depth conversion \nand interpretation of the MCS profile IAM GB1 (Fig. IV. 1B, 9 and details on \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n224 \n \n\nprocessing in Appendix V), transversal to the Horseshoe cluster, allows a new \nview on the top of the basement morphology and tectonics. In the present \nsection, we will present and discuss this seismic profile. \n\n The IAM-GB1 seismic profile (Fig. IV.9 and Appendix VI) strikes SW-NE and \ncrosses the Eastern Horseshoe Abyssal Plain, intersecting the Horseshoe \ncluster at an oblique angle (see Fig. IV. 8A). The structure and acoustic \nsignature of the basement changes along the seismic profile. In the \nsouthwestern end of the profile up to the CDP 4700 a block-like structured \nbasement is observed, similar to the oceanic crust structure reported by Rovere \net al. (2004) in the profile AR01. On the contrary, to the Northeast, the \nbasement morphology is smoother (not suggesting an oceanic crust affinity) \nand cut by several reverse blind faults. Some of these faults possibly \ncorrespond to the reactivation of extensional structures and affect the overlying \nseismic units (Fig. IV. 9).   \n\n \n\n \nFigure IV.9 \u2013 IAM-GB1 MCS profile with/without interpretation and the projection of the \nhorseshoe cluster area. See text for details and Fig. IV. 1B and Fig. IV. 8 for the location of the \nprofile. Seismic unit S1-V1 are interpreted as volcaniclastic sequences associated with rift \nepisodes, from the Jurassic to the Lower Cretaceous; Seismic unit Cr-Pg (Cretaceous -\nPaleogene) are post-rift deep sediments; AUGC is the Allocthonous Unit of the Gulf of Cadiz; \nSeismic unit Mw-Q are Miocene-Quaternary hemi-pelagic sediments and turbidite. Both SWIM1 \nand 2 fault are observed. SWIM1 fault is more discrete while SWIM2 fault is associated with a \nwide zone of deformation.  \n\nAbove the basement we identified the following seismic units whose calibration \nwas based on Hayward et al. (1999) and Roque (2007): \n\n\n\nIV. Micro-seismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz. Is there a link between  \nmicro-seismicity, high magnitude earthquakes and active faults? \n\n \n\n225 \n \n\nSeismic unit S1-V1 is a basal discontinuous unit mainly filling basement \ndepressions. It comprises two seismic sub-units V1 and S1. The first has a \ntransparent and low amplitude acoustic signature. Sub-unit S1 is discontinuous \nwith internal divergent reflections and with increasing thickness towards SW -\ndipping reflectors in the basement. Seismic unit S1-V1 could be related to \nvolcaniclastic sequences associated with rift episodes that in this region lasted \nfrom the Jurassic to the Lower Cretaceous;  \n\n Seismic unit Cr-Pg (Cretaceous -Paleogene) is characterized by continuous, \nhigh amplitude and subparallel internal reflections. Locally, between shot points \n100 and 1500 these reflections onlap the basement. Between shot points 1500 \nand 4500, seismic unit Cr-Pg covers unconformably the basement. We interpret \nthe basal unconformity as the surface marking the end of the oceanic rifting \nepisodes. This unit probably consists of deep-sea sediments deposited in a \npost-rift thermally subsiding basin.   \n\nThe Allocthonous Unit of the Gulf of Cadiz (AUGC) is characterized by internal \nchaotic reflections. From southwest to the northeast, it becomes more chaotic \nand the internal deformation increases, showing thrust faults dipping to \nnortheast. Also the thickness of the AUGC increases towards NE. The AUGC \nwas previously described as a succession of gravitational bodies (i.e. \nolistostromes, Torelli et al., 1997, Iribarren et al., 2007) corresponding to \nmassive and a rapid succession of from large submarine landslides. Both \nRoque (2007) and Terrinha et al. (2009) based on the internal deformation, \ninterpreted this seismic unit as an accretionary wedge. The building up of \nGorringe and Coral Patch seamounts in the Miocene could also have acted as \nlocal sources of gravitational deposits that were integrated in the AUGC \n(Roque, 2007 and Iribarren et al., 2007). As the compression increased with the \nWestwards migration of the Betic-Rif arc, the AUGC sequence became more \ndeformed and thick (from NE to SW). This sequence is interpreted as being of \nOligocene-Miocene age. \n\nSeismic unit Mw-Q (Miocene-Quaternary) shows continuous parallel internal \nreflections with high amplitude and larger thickness in the Southwest sector. \nThe lower boundary truncates the underlying sequence. The Mw-Q seismic unit \nis probably related to the deposition of hemi-pelagic sediments and turbidites \nfrom Miocene through present.  \n\nThe Pliocene-Quaternary deformation imaged in the IAM-GB1 is mostly \nlocalized in Northeast sector and is materialized by a NE-dipping thrust system \nwith exception of the zone of intersection with the SWIM1 strike-slip fault in the \nHorseshoe Abyssal Plain. Some of the faults show evidences for early \nextensional kinematics affecting up to the seismic unit Cr-Pg. The basement \ncompressive tectonics affect the top of the AUGC. To the Southwest, the SWIM \n1 fault zone, which has been shown to mediate seafloor to basement fluid \ncirculation (Hensen et al., 2015) is depicted down to the basement. The cross \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n226 \n \n\ncut relationship between these faults and the recent sediments cannot be \nassessed using IAM-GB1 due to its low vertical resolution. However, it has been \nreported by various authors, such as Zitellini et al. (2009). \n\nThe asymmetry in the distribution of the tectonic deformation is coincident with \nmorphologic transitions in the basement. The compressive tectonic deformation \nconcentrates on i) the limit between crustal oceanic affinity and what is \npresumed to be exhumed continental mantle (Figs. 9 and 12) and ii) the location \nof the Horseshoe seismic cluster.  The discrepancy between oceanic and \nexhumed serpentinized mantle boundaries of this work and Mart\u00ednez-Loriente et \nal. (2014) are minor and may result from the limited resolution of the available \ndata. \n\nIV.6. Discussion  \n\nIV.6.1.Seismicity clusters and tectonic structures \n\nIn this study we identified three seismicity clusters showing that the micro-\nseismic activity is the Gulf of Cadiz is not randomly distributed. The existence of \nthese clusters was already revealed in Geissler et al., (2010) and Cust\u00f3dio et \nal., (2016). However, our data allowed a more comprehensive evaluation (i.e. \nlarger dataset and lesser errors) of the seismicity distribution showing that \nseismic activity is generated mainly in the lithospheric mantle.  \n\nThe S\u00e3o Vicente and Gorringe clusters are elongated parallel to the strike of the \nmain thrust faults in the region, which coincide with the strike of the main \nMesozoic rifting-related extensional faults in the SW Iberia mainland, i.e. NNE-\nSSW to NE-SW (Terrinha et al., 2002). The S\u00e3o Vicente cluster is sub-parallel \nto the strike of the S\u00e3o Vicente fault and Marqu\u00eas de Pombal thrust fault, which \nresults from tectonic inversion of a rift fault (Terrinha et al., 2003). The NE-SW \ntrending frontal thrust of the Gorringe Bank is parallel, not only to the continental \ncrust rifting faults, but also to the oceanic crust extensional fabric described by \nHayward et al. (1999) and Zitellini et al. (2009), which is well exposed also in \nthe Coral Patch Ridge (see Fig. IV.1B for location). The constant strike of the \nMesozoic rifting faults from the Gorringe seamount to the Gibraltar arc argues \nfor a NW-SE extensional direction during Early Jurassic to end of Early \nCretaceous times, which is compatible with various kinematic reconstructions \n(e.g. Dewey et al., 1989, Schettino and Turco, 2011).  \n\nThis strongly suggests that in the Gorringe and S\u00e3o Vicente clusters the mantle \nis responding to the shortening induced by the present day stress field by \nreactivating extensional rift tectonic fabrics in zones of fault intersection, i.e. \n~NE-SW thrusts with ~W-E strike-slip faults. Present day NNE-SSW to NE-SW \nstriking faults correspond to reactivation of Mesozoic rift faults, while ~W -E \nstriking faults (the SWIM faults) may arise from the reactivation of oceanic \ntransfer / rift faults and ocean-continent transition structures associated with the \n\n\n\nIV. Micro-seismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz. Is there a link between  \nmicro-seismicity, high magnitude earthquakes and active faults? \n\n \n\n227 \n \n\nTethyan and Atlantic Ocean seafloor expansion. We hypothesize that these \nfault planes in the crust are expressed in the mantle by SE- dipping and vertical \nalignments of hypocenters, respectively (see figs 6-7). \n\nBeneath the Gorringe Bank most micro-seismicity is located between 20 and 40 \nkm in depth, below or within the limit of the serpentinized upper mantle (see Fig. \nIV. 10). According to Sallar\u00e8s et al. (2013), velocity is lower than upper mantle \nvalues (8.0\u20138.2km/s) up to ?20 km in depth (see Fig. IV.3 at the referenced \nwork). In contrast, some of the intermediate to high magnitude earthquakes are \nlocated near this limit (see also Fig. IV. 10). This may indicate different seismic \npropagation mechanisms for micro and larger earthquakes as discussed \nelsewhere in this work. \n\nNote that both higher magnitude and micro-seismicity focal mechanisms show \nreverse dip-slip solutions compatible with a NW-SE strike of Shmax. The \nsoutheastwards plunge of the ?1 can be interpreted as a deflection from the \nregional sub-horizontal near the Gorringe mantle thrust. The seismicity cannot \nbe related to either the HAT fault or the Gorringe Fault as described by \nMartinez-Loriente et al., 2014, 2016 and Sallar\u00e8s et al, 2013 (see Fig. IV.10). \nThe micro-seismicity should be related to a deeper thrust fault zone located \nwest of the HAT (see Fig. IV. 10).  \n\n \nFigure IV.10- - Projection of the seismicity across the Gorringe bank along a schematic \nrepresentation of the NRST (NEAREST)-P1 refraction profile (adapted from Sallar\u00e8s et al., \n2013, location in Fig. IV. 6, colors define the same lithospheric limits as in Fig. IV. 1B).  M>5 \nevents (open circles) are from Buforn et al.1988 and Stich et al., 2010. Note that the focal \nmechanisms preserve the map view geometry. Few events are coincident with the Gorringe \nFault. Notwithstanding, the seismicity seems to be related with a replication of this fault in depth \nat upper mantle levels.(1- Gorringe fault from Sallar\u00e8s et al., 2013 and HAT from Mart\u00ednez-\nLoriente et al., 2014); 2- possible deeper thrust faults, No vertical exaggeration.)  \n\n \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n228 \n \n\nWe also speculate that strike-slip focal mechanism in the SW and NE limit of \nthe seismicity cluster may be related to E-W to WNW-ESE transfer fault zones \nand OCT (see Fig. IV. 6A). \n\nThe S\u00e3o Vicente cluster is elongated parallel to the Marques de Pombal and the \nS\u00e3o Vicente faults, cutting across the ocean-thinned continental crust boundary \n(see Figs. IV. 7A-D) with prevailing seismicity located between 20 and 40 km \ndepth, i.e. in the mantle. The OCT coincides with a sub-vertical alignment of \nhypocenters (see Figs. 7A-D), which suggests that a fault zone extending from \nthe crust into the mantle is accommodating brittle displacement in the mantle. \nThis is in agreement with the OCT being reactivated as fault zone as suggested \nby Mart\u00ednez-Loriente et al., (2014). Note that according to our results, the micro-\nseismicity in this area cannot be explained by the MPF-BTF system as initially \npostulated in Zitellini et al., (2001, see Fig. IV.11). \n\n \nFigure IV.11 Projection of the seismicity in S\u00e3o Vicente Cluster along the AR-10 MCS profile \n(with a projection of the earthquakes located within 20 km of both sides of the profile). On top is \nthe interpretation of the AR-10 seismic profile (M- Miocene Unconformity; Cz- Discontinuity \nbetween the lower Cretaceous and Paleocene; CB-Chaotic body, PRF-03 as is in Fig. IV. 5D). \nOn the bottom Marqu\u00eas de Pombal and Back-Thrust Faults (MPF-BTF) are a simplified \nrepresentation of Zitellini et al. (2001) depth converted AR-10 interpretation. According to \nNEAREST experiment, most micro-seismicity is located off the MPF-BTF system. \n\nDuring the NEAREST experiment, the earthquake with the highest magnitude \n(ML=4.8) was located in this cluster. The focal mechanism solution of this event \n(code 78 in Figures 4, 7A and Appendix III.C and IV_C) is strike-slip with a \nsmall reverse dip-slip component. One of the fault planes is roughly NE-SW, \nsubvertical, while the other is a WNW-ESE, a shallower dipping fault dipping \ntowards NE (see Fig. IV.4). This FM nearly coincides with the FM solution for \nthe December 17th, 2009 Mw=5.8 earthquake, located in the same area and at \na depth between 36 and 43 km (see Figs. 1C and 4 as well as Appendix III.B \n\n\n\nIV. Micro-seismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz. Is there a link between  \nmicro-seismicity, high magnitude earthquakes and active faults? \n\n \n\n229 \n \n\nand IV_B). Neither of these events is related to Marques de Pombal or SWIM-\nlike Faults. We suggest that these events may be related either to a transfer \nzone marking the limit between the North Atlantic and the Tethys oceanic \ndomains (considering the vertical fault plane) or to a shallow dipping tectonic \nfabric inherited from the Mesozoic Tethys extension Note that these structures \nare also compatible with the depth location of micro-seismicity and that both \nfabrics (vertical and sub-horizontal) were identified in profiles 1-3 in Figs. 7B-D.  \n\nThe epicenters of the Horseshoe seismicity cluster are distributed across the \nHorseshoe Abyssal Thrust, the Horseshoe thrust, the SWIM-1 and SWIM-2 \nstrike-slip faults and also across three different basement types, Central \nAtlantic, Western Tethys crusts and exhumed serpentinized mantle domain (see \nFig. IV. 8A-D, Fig. IV.9). This cluster is sub-parallel to the average Shmax \ndirection and focal mechanisms are strike-slip (mostly) and thrust. Inspection of \nthe hypocenters profiles and IAM GB1 seismic profile suggests that the events \nof this cluster result from the reactivation of all mentioned discontinuities, except \nfor the Horseshoe Fault because this thrust is too shallow, with a maximum \ndepth of approximately 20 km (see Fig. IV.9 in Mart\u00ednez-Loriente et al., 2016). \nThese results argue in favor of assigning strike-slip events to the SWIM faults, \nwhich was until present considered an aseismic fault (Figs. 8A, 8D and 12). The \nthrust events can be related to blind thrusts in the mantle lying between the HF \nand the Gorringe thrust (see Fig. IV. 1B). \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate boundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n230 \n \n\n \nFigure IV.12 - Depth converted IAM-GB1 MCS profile with hypocenters distribution and FMs projected in the same cross-section (the focal mechanisms preserve \nthe map view).

Micro-seismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz. Is there a link between  \nmicro-seismicity, high magnitude earthquakes and active faults? \n\n \n\n231 \n \n\n \n\nFrom this work it results that all three seismicity clusters are located in fault \ninterference zones. The intersection of faults was shown to be an area of \nstress-strain concentration using analogue and numerical models that were \nused to investigate fault interference in the study area (see Rosas et al., 2012). \nThe map of lithospheric domains by Mart\u00ednez-Loriente et al. (2014) suggests \nthat some of the fault interference zones of the study area are associated with \nthe boundaries of different lithospheric domains. Although crustal faults are \nactive and coincident with these boundaries zones, they are too shallow to \ngenerate the seismicity recorded in NEAREST experiment, mostly located \nbetween 30 km and 50 km in depth. Instead, this seismic activity could be \nrelated to the replication at depth of this shallower fabric into the upper mantle \ncontrolled by the 3D localization of these tectonic-rheological boundaries (Figs. \n3, 6-9).  \n\nIV.6.2.Aseismic-seismic slip \n\nIn what concerns fault slip and fault seismicity in the study area, four points \nmust be highlighted, firstly, there are major thrusts and strike-slip faults imaged \nin the sediments and basement with accumulated slip that can exceed 1.5km in \nthe Pliocene-Quaternary; secondly, seismicity clusters do not coincide with \nthrust prolongation in depth, thirdly, there is barely any seismicity in the crust, \ni.e. it occurs predominately in the mantle regardless of the different lithospheric \ndomains (Fig. IV. 13); fourthly, there is both historical and instrumental \nevidences for events M~8 or larger. \n\nFor example, the western part of the Horseshoe seismicity cluster is located off \nto the west of the footwall of the Horseshoe fault at a depth of ?30 km, which is \nnot compatible with the prolongation in depth of this fault that detaches at 15-20 \nkm of depth. Nonetheless, the Horseshoe Fault accumulated ~1.0 km of slip \nduring the Pliocene-Quaternary (Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003, Zitellini et al., 2004, \nTerrinha et al., 2009 and Mart\u00ednez-Loriente et al., 2016).  \n\nConsidering that displacement is either accommodated by stick-slip and/or by \ncreep, understanding the transition between these two mechanisms can be \nimportant to find the possible link between active faults, high magnitude \nearthquakes and micro-seismicity in the study area. \n\nSerpentinization may be a controlling mechanism of seismic to aseismic slip \npartitioning, as described in different tectonic settings by Guillot et al. (2015). \nReinen et al. (1994) experiments with serpentinite materials at shallow depth \nindicate that only fault creep can occur at typical rates of plate motion. \nAccording to these authors, serpentinized areas do not favor seismicity but will \npromote local weakening allowing seismic slip to propagate into a serpentinized \nregion. \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n232 \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure IV.13- Earthquakes distribution in depth for the three identified clusters. The absence (or \nlow) of seismicity in the crust is clearly illustrated here. This is transversal to the all clusters and \nlithospheric domains (the depth scale refers to the sea level). Note that seismicity is located \nmostly below the serpentinization limit \n\n \n\nKnowing that the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain sediments are floored by a \nserpentized layer at least down to 20 km in depth (Sallar\u00e8s et al., 2013 and \nMart\u00ednez-Loriente et al., 2014) we should consider the rheology of serpentine \nwhen interpreting the seismicity clusters. Serpentinization can have two origins, \ni) a primary one during mantle exhumation at the formation of the oceanic crust \nand ii) a secondary one associated to fracturing and deep sea water circulation \n(Rosas et al., 2012 and Hensen et al.,2015). \n\nAnother side effect of aseismic deformation is the increase of pore fluid \npressure due to local tectonic compaction on the surrounding rocks. Pore fluid \npressure buildup promotes frictional slip at comparatively lower shear strains \nproducing cracking and porosity in the fault zone promoting fluid circulation. A \nnew group of mud volcanoes reported by Hensen et al. (2015) in the Horseshoe \n- SWIM faults interference zone occurs above the Horseshoe seismicity cluster. \nFluid signatures show a mixed pattern between minor clay dehydration, \ncarbonates recrystallization and oceanic crust alteration that is explained by \nupward fluids migration suggesting that strike-slip faults provide pathways for \ndeep-seated fluids.  \n\n\n\nIV. Micro-seismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz. Is there a link between  \nmicro-seismicity, high magnitude earthquakes and active faults? \n\n \n\n233 \n \n\nCo-seismic dehydration of serpentinite can be a key mechanism in fault \nweakening during a high-velocity frictional slip occurring during large magnitude \nevents (Lin et al., 2013). Frictional heating of serpentine-rich fault zones during \nthese events can thus lead to the release of large amounts of water vapor, \nresulting in increase of pore pressure, decrease of the effective stresses, i.e. \nweakening of fault zones and fluid migration into neighbor faults promoting extra \nslip. The transition from creep to stick-slip behaviors in fault zones due to \ndynamic weakening mechanism is used to explain unexpected high rupture \npatterns in subduction zones such as the 1999, Mw 7.6 Chi-Chi earthquake \n(Noda and Lapusta, 2013). The same authors refer this as a plausible rupture \nmechanism also in other geodynamic settings such as major strike-slip fault like \nSan Andreas Fault.  \n\nMicro-seismicity can be used as a proxy for the deep limit of the seismogenic \nzone. A gap of micro-seismicity can also indicate ductile recovery after a large \nmagnitude event. According to Jiang and Lapusta (2016) this is an explanation \nfor the absence of micro-seismicity at in the area of the 1857 Mw 7.9 Fort Tejon \nearthquake on the San Andreas/San Jacinto faults system and seismically \nquiescent megathrusts such as the Cascadia subduction zone.  \n\nDuring 1755-like events the rupture area can extend down to 90 km in depth \n(Matias et al., 2013), below the seismogenic zone for a Jurassic oceanic \nlithosphere. We hypothesize that the micro-seismicity gap on the HF (between \nthe Horseshoe and S\u00e3o Vicente clusters) can eventually be the result of ductile \nrecovery that followed this event. \n\nBased on the above it is suggested that:  \n\n- The existence of the serpentinized layer results in a decoupling between the \ncrustal and upper mantle tectonics. Accordingly, the serpentinization level \nshould accounts for the absence or scarcity of seismicity above 15km. \n\n- High magnitude events will propagate from upper mantle into crustal levels \nacross the serpentinized layer inducing superficial rupture. In contrast, present-\nday micro-seismicity is mainly restricted to the upper mantle (Figure IV.13 ). \n\n- The large magnitude events (M>8) can propagate the slip both up and \ndownwards, i.e. into and across the serpentinized layer as well as into and \nacross brittle-ductile boundary and disturbing the lithosphere-asthenosphere \nboundary (Figure IV.14). \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n234 \n \n\n \nFigure IV.14-- Schematic cross-section illustrating the relation between the stable creep \ndomains, with low to intermediate magnitude seismicity (red circles) distribution, tectonic slip \ndistribution (white arrows) and fault kinematics (black arrows). Micro-seismicity is constrained \nbetween two aseismic slip layers, between 15 and 50 km in depth (see the histogram with the \ndepth distribution of the events from the Gorringe and the horseshoe clusters). A top is limited \nby the serpentinization layer and at the bottom by the brittle-ductile transition zone. During a \nlarge magnitude earthquake (black star) the rupture area propagates both upwards and \ndownwards, i.e. slip propagates into the upper crust faults showing surface rupture or not (blind \nfaults). For a 1755-like event extend below the limit of the seismogenic zone down to 90 km in \ndepth.  \n\nIV.7. Conclusion \n\nThe main conclusions of this work are:  \n\nWe identified three seismicity clusters located in the areas of the Gorringe \nBank, S\u00e3o Vicente Canyon and along the Horseshoe Abyssal plain showing \nthat seismicity is not uniformly distributed in the Gulf of Cadiz area also as \nsuggested by NEAREST preliminary results (Geissler et al., 2010) and \nclustering analysis in Cust\u00f3dio et al, (2016); \n\nThe three seismicity clusters characterized in this work show that the present \nday micro-seismic activity is generated in the lithospheric mantle and \nconcentrates at fault\u2019s intersections, suggesting that the crustal fabric may be \nreplicated in the lithospheric mantle;  \n\nThe inferred fault interference zones in the upper mantle are associated with \nboundaries of lithospheric domains localizing stress and seismic strain; \n\nActive crustal faults with bathymetric expression, such as the Horseshoe and \nMarqu\u00eas de Pombal faults are either locked or move through slow aseismic slip. \nFrictional slip may only result from high magnitude earthquakes;  \n\nSerpentinization controls seismicity distribution by inducing tectonic decoupling \nand inhibiting micro-seismicity to occur above the serpentinized layer. Only \nduring high-magnitude events it is expected seismic rupture to propagate \nupwards across the serpentinized layer up to the surface.  \n\nSlip propagation from a non-serpentinized mantle into serpentinized mantle is a \npossible mechanism to produce larger slip areas, due to the release of pore \nfluid pressure accumulated during previous aseismic events. This mechanism \ncan account for larger than expected slip for a high magnitude earthquake, like \n\n\n\nIV. Micro-seismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz. Is there a link between  \nmicro-seismicity, high magnitude earthquakes and active faults? \n\n \n\n235 \n \n\nit is assumed for the 1755 event from numerical modelling of tsunami and \ninundation (Johnston, 1996, Gradin et al., 2007, Baptista et al.1998, 2011). \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n236 \n \n\nV. Discussion and conclusion  \n\nThe results of the present study allow for the discussion of the following topics: \n\nOur study started with the following main objectives: \n\n? origin and characterization of the micro-seismicity in the study area; \n\n? slip distribution in the active faults,  \n\n? what mechanisms control seismicity distribution;  \n\n? strain partitioning mechanisms; \n\n? the plate boundary position in the area.  \n\nIn this final chapter we will sum up and discuss our findings in the scope of the \nproposed objectives and point out possible future work. \n\nV.1.The micro-seismicity in the study area \n\nThe micro-seismicity distribution in the Gulf of Cadiz was studied based on the \ndata recorded in 11 months temporary deployment of 25 ocean-bottom seismic \nnetwork. The initial dataset included 746 events recorded in ? 3 stations. From \nthose, 590 events are located in the restricted area of the NEAREST network as \ndefined by external envelope of the stations locations. Events locations were \nimproved and tested using different methodologies. The final location results \nfrom the simultaneous inversion of a 1D velocity model including stations \ncorrections to incorporate sub-surface geological variability (details in chapter \nIII). \n\nThe micro-seismicity concentrates in the upper mantle (between 30 and 50 km \nin depth) in the 3 following clusters, the Gorringe Bank, the S\u00e3o Vicente Canyon \nand in the vicinity of SWIM 1 and Horseshoe Fault, the Horseshoe cluster. The \nremaining seismicity was mostly located below the Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary, \nthe Portim\u00e3o bank, and Guadalquivir bank. It is worthwhile noting that the depth \ndistribution of the hypocentres is common to all clusters regardless the \nlithospheric domain.  \n\nThe three clusters are also the loci of intermediate and large magnitude \nearthquakes. The Horseshoe cluster hosted the Mw=7.8, 28th of February 1969 \n(the highest magnitude instrumental event in the area) and the Mw ? 6.0, 12th of \nFebruary 2007 earthquakes. While, the S\u00e3o Vicente cluster is the location of the \n17th December earthquake with Mw=5.5. The Gorringe cluster is coincident with \nMw?4.5 events, in 19th of July and 29th of August 2005. Note that all clusters are \nalso located in the vicinity of major active faults.  \n\nFocal mechanism solutions are found with a double-couple fault-plane solution \nprogram based on the polarities of P-wave first arrival. The results showed 82 \n\n\n\nV. Discussion and conclusion \n \n\n237 \n \n\nwell constrained solutions. Most events indicate a reverse (21%) and strike-slip \nsolutions (32%). In the S\u00e3o Vicente cluster, the dominant fault plane solutions \nwere strike- or oblique slip. In the Gorringe cluster, we had mostly reverse and \noblique slip. While the Horseshoe cluster and the area of the accretionary \nwedge showed mostly reverse and strike-slip solutions. \n\nThe stress tensor inversion showed a NW-SE maximum compression in the \nWestern Horseshoe sub-cluster, the S\u00e3o Vicente cluster and the SW Gorringe \nsub-cluster and nearly NNW-SSE in the Eastern Horseshoe and the NE \nGorringe sub-clusters. These results, in general, diverge from Geissler et al., \n2010 preliminary results. In the S\u00e3o Vicente cluster (Northern cluster in the \nreference work) is referred a maximum compression nearly WNW-ESE, while in \nthe Horseshoe cluster (southern cluster in the reference paper) is roughly NNE-\nSSW. Some discrepancies with Geissler et al. (2010) probably arise from the \nfact that the present study added 33 new focal mechanism solutions to the \ncatalogue.  \n\nThe maximum horizontal compression (SHmax) and dominant stress regime \nbased on the stress tensor details for each cluster was calculated following the \nWorld Stress Map Project guidelines. \n\nIn the S\u00e3o Vicente cluster, SHmax is roughly NW-SE, at ?50\u00ba angle with the \nNNE-SSW cluster striking direction. The dominant stress regime is strike-slip, in \nagreement with prevailing focal mechanisms solutions. \n\nIn the Horseshoe cluster, SHmax is roughly NNW-SSE in the E and NW-SE in \nthe W. In the E, SHmax defines a ~50\u00ba angle with the main SWIM strike-slip \nfault, the expected maximum compression direction on a strike-slip fault. \nConversely, in the W, SHmax direction is perpendicular to the Horseshoe thrust \nfault, consistent with the thrust kinematics and sub-parallel to the cluster \nalignment. Nevertheless, both sub-clusters have a strike-slip dominant stress \nregime compatible with the E FMs solutions but unclearly explained in the \nWestern domain. \n\nThe Gorringe cluster SHmax is roughly NNW-SSE oriented, defining a high \nangle (70\u00ba-75\u00ba) with the Gorringe fault strike, compatible with thrust kinematics. \nHowever the dominant stress regime is strike\u2013slip, as the prevailing FMs are \nmostly oblique, combining strike-slip with reverse-slip. \n\nAll the above SHmax orientations are in reasonable agreement with SHmax \ndetermination derived from neotectonic numerical modeling in the area of Neres \net al. (2016) that used GPS plate kinematics, potential fields and seismic strain. \nThis agreement from independent approaches is interpreted as a validation of \nthe methodology used in the present work \n\nV.2.Lithospheric domains and the limits of the seismogenic zone \n\nIt is argued in this work that micro-seismicity provides valuable information \nabout the limits of seismogenic zone based on the following. \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n238 \n \n\nOne of the main results of this work is the comprehensive understanding of \ndepth limit of low to intermediate magnitude earthquakes in the study area. \nUsing 1 D velocity model to define EQs hypocentres in areas with high \nlithospheric variability such as the Gulf of Cadiz was overcome with stations \ncorrections in our location models. Different locations methods and velocity \nmodels to control the depth variability were tested.  \n\nAccording to our results all EQ events are located in the upper mantle with \nmaximum depths of 50-55 km. This observation is common to all clusters \nregardless of the lithospheric transitions and composition.  \n\nThe lower limit for cold Jurassic oceanic lithosphere seismogenic zone or brittle-\nductile transition is roughly between 50 and 55 km, coinciding with the ?600\u00baC \ngeotherm, for simple temperature dependent models (e.g. Mackenzie et al, \n2005), which is also the transition between velocity weakening - velocity \nstrengthening behaviors of dry olivine (Boettcher et al., 2007). More \ncomprehensive models of the oceanic lithosphere (combining temperature-\npressure-dependent thermal properties, hydrothermal circulation and oceanic \ncrust contributions) set this limit to 700\u00baC-800\u00baC (Grose et al., 2013), also at 50-\n55 km depth. \n\nIt is known that in continental lithosphere seismicity is also restricted to \ntemperatures below 600\u00baC (e.g. Sloan et al, 2010). However, the upper mantle \nis generally above 600\u00baC (e.g Mckenzie et al., 2005), thus usually seismicity \noccurs in the crust within continental lithosphere.  \n\nAt continental margins, seismic activity can display a combination of the \nseismogenic behaviour of both continental and oceanic settings (Craig et al., \n2011), such as for eastern and north-eastern African margins where seismicity \nextends below the expected depth for the typical continental lithosphere but not \nbelow the seismogenic limit at the adjacent old oceanic lithosphere. The authors \nargue that this is due to a compositional transition between the two types of \nlithosphere. \n\nThe existence of seismicity in the continental upper mantle in the Gulf of Cadiz \nwas reported by several previous studies based on teleseismic records (e.g \nStich et al., 2010) and in local temporary deployments (Geissler et la., 2010, \nGrevemeyer et., 2016 in attachment)  \n\nLet us assume a simple model where seismicity in the continental lithosphere is \nlimited by the 600\u00baC isotherm. To explore this thermal limit in the Gulf of Cadiz, \nwe created simplified geothermal gradient models, as follows. We combined \nheat flow measurements with stratified geological models of the lithosphere \n(deduced from geophysical and core data, Hayes et al., 1972, Ryan et al., 1973 \nGonzalez et al. (1996), Rovere et al., (2004), Sallar\u00e8s et al. (2011) and \nMart\u00ednez-Loriente et al. (2014)). The conductive geotherm in a horizontally \nstratified subsurface is calculated by solving the steady state heat flow equation \n\n\n\nV. Discussion and conclusion \n \n\n239 \n \n\n( )\n=\n\n? ( )\n( )\n\n \n\nWhere T is temperature, z is depth, A is heat production and k is the thermal \nconductivity. Heat flow variation in depth can be deduced based on the \nfollowing approximation, assuming that heat flow ( ) has a linear relation with \ndepth and heat radioactivity: \n\n \n\n= ? ( ) \u00d7  \n\nwhere,  is the surface heat flow. \n\nIn the next step, we estimate the steady \u2013state temperature in depth z as follow \n(Anderson, 1989):  \n\n= +\n0.5 \u00d7 ( + )\n\n( )\n\u00d7  \n\nThe heat flow data was extracted from Grevemeyer et al. (2009, 2017) and \nJimenez \u2013Munt et al. (2010). We used the thermal proprieties in Fernandez et \nal, (1998), Watts and Burov (2003), Vil\u00e1 et al. (2010) and Grevemeyer et al., \n(2017). \n\nWe defined the following different layered models to compare with the local \nsetting of the three clusters: \n\n? a three layer model to simulate the exhumed serpentinized mantle \ndomain (details in the Table V.1): sediments, hydrated mantle and \nunaltered mantle; \n\n? four layered model to describe the oceanic lithosphere domain (details in \nthe Table V.2)  \n\n? five layered model to define the thinned continental lithospheric \ndomains: sediments, upper crust, lower crust, hydrated mantle and \nunaltered mantle (details in the Table V.3). \n\nWe consider that all layers have isotropic and homogeneous thermal properties \nand heat production. \n\nThe exhumed serpentinized mantle domain: \n\nIn the exhumed mantle models we explored two initial surface heat flow (SHF) \nvalues 60.7 and 65 mW/m2 and two sediments thickness, 0.5 and 4 km. These \nvalues reflect the heat flow data observed in the vicinity of Gorringe bank and in \nHorseshoe Abyssal plain (HAP) area (within the exhumed mantle domain, \nGrevemeyer et al., 2017 and Jimenez-Munt et al., 2010). Also both MCS \nreflection and refraction seismic profiles (e.g. Jimenez-Munt et al., 2010 and \nMartinez-Loriente et al., 2013) show that the sediments thickness in the GB is ? \n0.5 km while in the HAP is nearly 4km (see Figure V.1A). We limited the \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n240 \n \n\nserpentinization level to 20 km in depth as observed P1-NEAREST refraction \nprofile (Martinez et al., 2013). \n\nOur models are plotted in the Figure V.1B. Initial higher SHF values and thicker \nsediment cover lead to hotter models (red lines). Note that having a thin \nsediment cover with higher SHF (full red line in Figure V.1B) and thick sediment \ncover with lower SHF (dashed blue line in Figure V.1B) leads to similar thermal \nmodels. Our models plot the 600\u00baC geotherm between 46-53 km in depth (45-\n52 km below sea floor) in the Gorringe Bank (see Figure V.1A and full line \nmodels in Figure V.1B) and between 45-50km in the HAP (see Figure V.1A and \ndashed line models in Figure V.1B).  \n\nThe highest SHF values are observed in the vicinity of the Gorringe Bank and \ndecreases towards the East, in HAP (e.g. Jimenez-Munt et al., 2010). We may \nconsider that the model with the thinner sediment cover and highest SHF (full \nred line in Figure V.1B) is more adequate to define the SW Gorringe sub-cluster \nsetting while the 4 km thick sediment cover with lower SHF value fits the W \nHAP sub-cluster. \n\nOur results show that seismicity in the SW Gorringe sub-cluster (to the left in \nFigure V.1A) is located above the 600\u00baC limit. This is observed even if we \nconsider a hotter model, with SHF?65 mW/m2 (red full line in Figure V.1B). \nHowever, in the HAP cluster, 3 events are located below this thermal limit if we \nconsider SHF of 65 mW/m2.   \n\nAnother interesting result is that 8 events in the SW Gorringe sub-cluster and 3 \nevents in the W HAP sub-clusters are located in the serpentinized mantle. \nAccordingly, it may indicate that seismicity may be also generated in the \npartially serpentinized layer or alternatively, that serpentinization may be \nheterogeneously distributed both in Gorringe bank and HAP.  \n\nHowever, these results should be taken with caution as the the average depth \nerrors are 5.7km and 7.7km in the SW Gorringe sub-cluster and W HAP sub-\ncluster, respectively, and, as we can observe in Figure V.1C, the Vp and Vs \nvelocity models used to located the NEAREST dataset do not reflect the \ncompositional models of these two sub-clusters.  \n\n \nTable V.1-Exhumed serpentinized mantle thermal models.

The main differences are the \nsediment and crustal thickness (see Table V.2 and Figure V.2A-C). Both \nmodels had a SHF of 57mW/m2, in agreement with the values in Grevemeyer et \nal. (2009) and Jimenez-Munt et al. (2010). The velocity model resulted from \nhypocenter-velocity inversion method (Figure V.2C). \n\nOur results are plotted in the Figure V.2 B. The 600\u00b0C isotherm is located \nbetween 47 and 50 km in depth. Thinner sediment and thicker crustal layers \nresult in a relatively hotter model. One hypocenter in the Horseshoe sub-cluster \nand 5 in the southern limit of SVC were located below this limit (Figure V.2A). \nLike in the previous models some events are located in the hydrated mantle \ndomain.

The thermal proprieties and layering are presented in the Table V.3. We \nconsidered a surface heat flow of 59mW/m2 based on values described for the \nMarques de Pombal Fault area, after topography correction, in Grevemeyer et \nal., (2009). According to the authors, the MPF tectonic activity has low influence \non the surface heat flow value.  \n\nIn the Gorringe cluster area, the model was 11km thick for both the continental \ncrust (upper and lower crust) and the serpentinized mantle. In the S\u00e3o Vicente \ncluster area, we considered 17km and 7km thick for the crust and hydrated \nmantle, respectively (Table V.3. and Figure V.3A).These values were taken \nfrom analysis of Sallar\u00e9s et al 2011 and Rovere et al. 2004.  \n\nOur models show that the 600\u00b0C limit is located at 39 km and 45km in the S\u00e3o \nVicente and Gorringe sub-clusters, respectively (Figure V.3A-B). Based on \nthese results, 5 earthquakes, in the Gorringe Sub-cluster, are located below this \nlimit although within the depth error limit (5.2km). In the northern S\u00e3o Vicente \narea 65 events lie below the 600\u00baC isothermal, 15 of which below the error limit \n(5.6 km) \n\nThe results indicate that assumed thermal models reasonably fit the Gorringe \nbank compositional layering. However, it may fail to reproduce the lithospheric \nstructuring in the northern S\u00e3o Vicente sub-cluster. We point out the following \nhypotheses: \n\na)  Incorrect layered model? \n\nThe selected number of layers agrees with the information provided by \ngeophysical data (wide-angle seismic reflection and refraction profiles in \nGonzalez et al., 1996 and Sallar\u00e8s et al., 2011). However, there is some \nuncertainty in the thickness of selected layers particularly in the crustal levels. \nOur tests showed that any increase in the crustal thickness moved the 600\u00baC \nisotherm into shallow levels, increasing the number of events below this \nrheological limit. Decreasing the crustal thickness would not agree with \nconstraints imposed by the available geophysical data.  \n\nb) Inadequate velocity model? \n\nWe should also discuss if our general velocity model is adequate to define the \ncompositional model in the northern S\u00e3o Vicente sub-cluster. In Figure V.3C, \nwe see that the general model is in roughly faster than the thinned continental \nlayering in both NE Gorringe and Northern SVC. Some of these differences \nshould be absorbed by stations corrections included in the location method. \n\n\n\nV. Discussion and conclusion \n \n\n245 \n \n\nc)The thermal proprieties are inaccurate? \n\nThe heat production and thermal conductivity in the models are mostly \nextracted from the Vil\u00e0 et al., (2010). Since both areas are at a continental \nmargin, we considered that the crust was more mafic with lower heat \nproduction. So, we slightly increase the heat production to 9.80E-07W/m3 and \n3.70E-07W/m3 in the upper and lower crust, respectively. Accordingly, the \n600\u00baC isotherm moved down to 49km in depth (blue full line in B and see details \nin the Table V.3). As a result few hypocentres were located below this depth \nlimit (Figure V.3A). \n\nIn general thermal models are in good agreement depth distribution of the \nhypocentres. For all, selected areas seismicity is mostly located above the \n600\u00baC limit. This is the typical temperature limit at the oceanic domain.  \n\nAt the continental domain seismicity is mostly located at the crust. Our results \nshow that hypocentres, in continental domain are mostly located at the upper \nmantle, but above the 600\u00baC isotherm.  \n\nThese results also attest the adequacy of the earthquakes location method \napplied in our study.  \n\n \nTable V.3- Thinned continental lithosphere thermal models.

To the right is the compositional model of the upper lithosphere is \nproposed based on the Vp model derived in chapter III.3.2 \n\n \n\nV.3.Seismicity and the active faults in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\nSeismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz area is located at intermediate depth (mostly 30-\n50km) below the limits of observation for MCS seismic and refraction profiles. \nHowever, keeping in mind these limitations, we can still compare geological \npatterns and crustal transitions observed at shallow depth with the hypocenters \ntrends and fault-plane solutions derived from our seismological data. \n\nBoth the Gorringe and the S\u00e3o Vicente clusters define alignments sub-parallel \nto the striking direction of major active ~NE-SW striking thrust faults and \nassociated seamounts.  \n\nIn the Gorringe cluster, seismicity is aligned sub-parallel to the Gorringe Fault \nthat limits to NW, the Gorringe Bank. According to Jim\u00e9nez-Munt et al. (2010), \nthis fault is a major NW verging, sub-crustal thrust fault with a ramp and flat \ngeometry related with at least 20 km shortening in the 5-10 Ma interval (upper-\nmiddle Miocene). Sallar\u00e8s et al. (2013) also identified a low angle SE-dipping, \nhigh serpentinization zone resulting as an additional evidence for the presence \nof a major thrust fault.  \n\nThe prevailling FMs in the area are strike-slip and reverse dip-slip both for ML?3 \nrecorded in the NEAREST experiment and higher magnitude earthquakes \ncompiled from permenent land networks (see Figure V.4). However, none of \nthese are related to the Gorringe Fault as inferred from MCS seismic profiles \nsince this is too shallow in the crust. Seismicity should be related to a deeper \nstructure. However, it is puzzling that only two events with ML?3 have reverse \ndip-slip solutions, the remaining earthquakes show nearly pure strike-slip \nsolutions, with fault plane solutions striking ?N-S to NNE-SSW and ? E-W to \nNW-SE. This is also in agreement with the dominant stress regime in Neres et \nal, (2016) or estimations based on the only on NEAREST dataset (even though \nit refers to low to intermediate magnitude events).   \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n248 \n \n\n \nFigure V.4-Focal mechanism solutions of earthquakes with ML?3.0 recorded in the \nNEAREST OBS network (max ML=4.8, with black compression quadrants) and the fault \nplane solution for the highest magnitude earthquakes recorded in the land network (red \ncompression, full black lines define active faults, dashed lines are inferred or possible \nactive faults, white lines are blind faults and blue line is the PIAB- Paleo Iberia-Africa \nplate Boundary, from Rovere et al., 2004). \n\nThe Gorringe seamount comprehends the intersection of the NW-SE trending \nOCT, the NE-SW striking Gorringe thrust and the western prolongation of the \n~W-E striking strike-slip SWIM faults. It appears that all these tectonic faults and \ndiscontinuities are being reactivated generating micro-seismicity in the shallow \nlithospheric mantle (figure V.1). \n\nThe S\u00e3o Vicente cluster of epicentres is at the intersection of NNE-SSW to NE-\nSW striking thrust faults (S. Vicente canyon fault and Marqu\u00eas de Pombal \nthrust) and one WNW-ESE striking SWIM strike-slip fault that is coincident with \nthe Ocean-Continent Transition. \n\n\n\nV. Discussion and conclusion \n \n\n249 \n \n\nThe MP thrust fault soling out at approximately 20 km of depth was described \nas a good candidate to the 1755 earthquake source, combined either with a \nBack-Thrust Fault (BTF- Zitellini et al., 2001) system or with Horseshoe Fault \n(Ribeiro et al, 2006). However, these faults are too shallow to account for the \nrecorded micro-seismicity.  \n\nRecent earthquakes with magnitude >4, (e.g. 17th December 2009 event with \nMw?5.5) and also the highest magnitude event recorded in NEAREST network \nwith ML=4.8 are located in this cluster. Both resulted from similar FMs, oblique \nsolution combining strike-slip with reverse dip-slip component (Figure V.4). One \nof the fault planes is roughly NE-SW, sub-vertical, while the other is a WNW-\nESE, a shallower dipping fault dipping towards NE. Neither of these events is \nalso related to Marques de Pombal or SWIM-like Faults.  \n\nAlternatively, the first fault plane is sub-parallel to the SVF, that strikes ?NE-SW \nsteeply dipping to the SE. In Pereira and Alves (2013) is described as the \npossible offshore extension of the Messejana-Plasencia Fault Zone (MPFZ) \nmore than 400 km long hosting a dolerite dyke with tens of meters of thickness, \nindicating a deep origin of this fault. The other fault plane is may be related to a \nshallow dipping tectonic fabric inherited from the Mesozoic Tethys extension. \n\nHence it is proposed that the NE-SW striking steep faults (S. Vicente fault \nsystem) and the SWIM strike-slip faults and sub-parallel OCT accommodate \nearthquake slip and strain partitioning in the S. Vicente seismicity cluster. \n\nIn the Horseshoe cluster seismicity is distributed along a NW-SE alignment, \nsub-parallel to the transition between exhumed serpentinized mantle or of \nWestern Tethys domains and the Central Atlantic oceanic crust. It is also on the \ntail of the Gorringe thrust and extends to the East across the intersection of the \nHorseshoe thrust and SWIM faults (Figure V.4). This cluster contains the source \narea of 28th February 1969 earthquake with Ms?8.0, located at 22-33km in \ndepth, the largest instrumental event reported in the Gulf of Cadiz region. Again, \nthe NEAREST dataset also reported an event located with ML?3.9, in the same \narea, at the same depth with similar FMs (event 53, Figure V.4). The events are \nlocated on top or at the footwall of the HAT but vertically displaced from this \nstructure. To the East is the source area of the 12 February 2007 had Mw ? 6.0, \nwith a hypocenter at 40 km beneath the seafloor and a moment tensor \nindicating thrust faulting with a small component of strike slip (Figure V.4).   \n\nIn this cluster, the prevailing FMs are: a) nearly pure reverse dip-slip solution to \nthe west of the HAT; b) pure strike-slip solutions to the East of the Horseshoe \nfault or in the vicinity of the SWIM faults system; c) oblique slip (combining \nstrike-slip with reverse dip-slip) on top of the Horseshoe Fault and the \ninterference zone with the SWIM fault system. Accordingly, we speculate that \nthe fault zones imaged at crustal levels may be the expression of similar \nstructures in the mantle, here replicated by distribution of the focal mechanism \nsolutions.  \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n250 \n \n\nFrom the NEAREST experiment results that all three seismicity clusters are \nlocated in fault interference zones. The map of lithospheric domains by \nMartinez-Loriente et al. (2014) suggests that the fault interference zones of the \narea are also associated with the boundaries of different lithospheric domains. \nAlthough crustal faults are active and coincident with these interference zones \nthey are too shallow to generate the seismicity recorded in NEAREST \nexperiment. Instead, this seismic activity can be related to the replication of this \nshallow tectonic fabric into the upper mantle controlled also by the location of \nthese lithospheric transitions.  \n\nOutside the NEAREST network area, the earthquakes identification and location \nbecome less accurate. However, we could recover some events and define a \nfew focal mechanism solutions. In Figure V.5, we show the events locations in \nmap view and projected along the P2 NEAREST refraction profile, respectively.  \n\nFew events are located in the upper crust at the continental domain. Outside \nthis area, seismicity is restricted to the upper mantle below 20 km in depth. As \nin the Gorringe cluster, it seems that in the South Portuguese continental \nmargin the hypocenters distribution dip to the N, following the continental-ocean \nboundary zone slope (see Figure V.5). The relation between the bending \nstresses associated with flexural isostasy in the OCT and seismicity distribution \nin the Gulf of Cadiz was already explored in Neves and Neves (2009). However, \nthe authors suggest that flexure bending stress is not sufficient to produce brittle \nfailure and earthquakes in the crust and upper mantle. An additional weakening \nmechanism is necessary to reduce the brittle strength in the ocean\u2013continent \ntransition. They suggest inherited mechanical weaknesses as a possible \nadditional mechanism. \n\nFocal mechanisms show mostly strike-slip and reverse-slip solutions, \ncompatible with SWIM and thrust faults kinematics. However, the reverse-slip \nsolutions are located at mantle depths, displaced by 30 km from the \naccretionary wedge limit. Accordingly, these focal mechanisms are \nspeculatively associated with a deeper thrust fault that is compatible with the \neast-dipping subduction zone under the Gibraltar arc described in Gutscher et \nal. 2002 and Duarte et al., 2013.  \n\n \n\n\n\nV. Discussion and conclusion \n \n\n251 \n \n\n \nFigure V.5- Schematic representation of the P2 NEAREST refraction profile (adapted  from \nSall\u00e1res et al. (2011) and Martinez-Loriente et al. (2013) with a projection of the earthquakes \nlocated within 10 km of both sides of the profile. Abbreviations: CAOC- Central Atlantic Oceanic \nCrust and WTOC- Western Tethys Oceanic Crust. \n\nV.4.Strain partitioning, aseismic and seismic slip:  \n\nStrain partitioning in the Gulf of Cadiz is described in previous works. Terrinha \net al. (2009) based on swath bathymetry and MCS seismics suggested that the \npresent day NW-wards movement of Nubia with respect to Iberia is \naccommodated by strain partitioning in dextral wrenching on WNW\u2013ESE \ntrending steep faults and thrusting on the NE\u2013SW trending fault.  \n\nOur study shows that micro-seismicity results from fault plane solutions with \nprevailing strike-slip and reverse dip-slip kinematics. This is common to the \nthree clusters. Hence, it may indicate that seismic strain is partitioned in two \nfault systems with the similar striking directions to the crustal structures. Yet, \nseismicity is located at intermediate depths in the upper lithospheric mantle \nsuggesting a tectonic pattern and strain partitioning mechanism similar to the \none described for the shallow crust replicated in the uppermost mantle. \n\nIf micro-seismicity is, detached from the crustal thrusts, how does slip \naccumulate/propagate in crustal thrusts? Are high magnitude earthquakes also \ngenerated in mantle faults? In Figure V.4, we plotted the focal mechanism and \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n252 \n \n\nmoment tensors with M?3 recorded in the NEAREST network (in black) and in \nthe permanent land networks (in red). Most events are located >20km in depth \nand the shallower events are mostly strike-slip solutions. For M?5, the fault \nplane solutions show oblique motion, combining reverse dip-slip with strike-slip. \nAccording to geological interpretation in the chapter IV, none of these events \ncould be related to the crustal faults.   \n\nPrevious works have described the crustal faults systems to be active. For \nexample, the Horseshoe Fault accumulated ~1.0 km of slip during the Pliocene-\nQuaternary (Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003, Zitellini et al., 2004, Terrinha et al., 2009 and \nMart\u00ednez-Loriente et al., 2016). Note that displacement in active faults is either \naccommodated by stick-slip and/or by creep. The transition between these two \nmechanisms is largely dependent on the characteristic of the fault zone, such \nas frictional proprieties (e,g Sholz, 1998). \n\nSerpentinization may be a controlling mechanism of seismic to aseismic slip \npartitioning, as described in different tectonic settings by Guillot et al. (2015). \nReinen et al. (1994) experiments with serpentinite materials at shallow depth \nindicate that only fault creep can occur at typical rates of plate motion. \nAccording to these authors, serpentinized areas do not favor seismicity but will \npromote local weakening allowing seismic slip to propagate into a serpentinized \nregion. \n\nKnowing that to the W of the HAT, the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain sediments are \nfloored by a serpentinized layer at least down to 20 km in depth (Sallar\u00e8s et al., \n2013 and Mart\u00ednez-Loriente et al., 2014) we should consider the rheology of \nserpentine when interpreting the seismicity clusters. Serpentinization can have \ntwo origins, i) a primary one during mantle exhumation at the formation of the \noceanic crust and ii) a secondary one associated to fracturing and deep sea \nwater circulation (Rosas et al., 2012 and Hensen et al.,2015 Silva et al., in \npress, in chapter IV). \n\nAnother side effect of aseismic deformation is the increase of pore fluid \npressure due to local tectonic compaction on the surrounding rocks. Pore fluid \npressure build up promotes frictional slip at comparatively lower shear strains \nproducing cracking and porosity in the fault zone promoting fluid circulation. A \nnew group of mud volcanoes reported by Hensen et al. (2015) in the Horseshoe \n- SWIM faults interference zone occurs above the Horseshoe seismicity cluster. \nFluid signatures show a mixed pattern between minor clay dehydration, \ncarbonates recrystallization and oceanic crust alteration that is explained by \nupward fluids migration suggesting that strike-slip faults provide pathways for \ndeep-seated fluids.  \n\nCo-seismic dehydration of serpentinite can be a key mechanism in fault \nweakening during a high-velocity frictional slip occurring during large magnitude \nevents (Lin et al., 2013). Frictional heating of serpentine-rich fault zones during \n\n\n\nV. Discussion and conclusion \n \n\n253 \n \n\nthese events can thus lead to the release of large amounts of water vapor, \nresulting in increase of pore pressure, decrease of the effective stresses, i.e. \nweakening of fault zones and fluid migration into neighbor faults promoting extra \nslip. The transition from creep to stick-slip behaviors in fault zones due to \ndynamic weakening mechanism is used to explain unexpected high rupture \npatterns in subduction zones such as the 1999, Mw 7.6 Chi-Chi earthquake \n(Noda and Lapusta, 2013). The same authors refer this as a plausible rupture \nmechanism also in other geodynamic settings such as major strike-slip fault like \nSan Andreas Fault.  \n\nMicro-seismicity can be used as a proxy for the deep limit of the seismogenic \nzone. A gap of micro-seismicity can also indicate ductile recovery after a large \nmagnitude event. According to Jiang and Lapusta (2016) this is an explanation \nfor the absence of micro-seismicity in the area of the 1857 Mw 7.9 Fort Tejon \nearthquake on the San Andreas/San Jacinto faults system and seismically \nquiescent megathrusts such as the Cascadia subduction zone.  \n\nDuring 1755-like events the rupture area can extend down to 90 km in depth \n(Matias et al., 2013), below the seismogenic zone for a Jurassic oceanic \nlithosphere. We hypothesize that the micro-seismicity gap on the HF (between \nthe Horseshoe and S\u00e3o Vicente clusters) can eventually be the result of ductile \nrecovery that followed this event. \n\nBased on the above it is suggested that:  \n\n- The existence of the serpentinized layer results in a decoupling between the \ncrustal and upper mantle tectonics. Accordingly, the serpentinization level \nshould account for the absence or scarcity of seismicity above 15km. \n\n- High magnitude events will propagate from upper mantle into crustal levels \nacross the serpentinized layer inducing superficial rupture. In contrast, present-\nday micro-seismicity is mainly restricted to the upper mantle. \n\n- Slip of large magnitude events (M>8) can propagate both up and downwards, \ni.e. into and across the serpentinized layer, as well as into and across brittle-\nductile boundary, disturbing the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (see Fig. \nIV.14). \n\nV.5.The plate boundary in the study area \n\nAlthough this study did not report the existence of a series of aligned linear \nseismicity cluster that could help defining a plate boundary we think it \ncontributed to its understanding. \n\nSeismicity occurs in clusters at large faults intersections. All these clusters \nindicate the seismic activity of various fault sets, including the SWIM faults, \nprobably the best candidates for accommodating the wrench displacement of \nNubia with respect to SW Iberia.  \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n254 \n \n\nIt also results from the present study that widespread serpentinization proposed \nby Sallar\u00e9s et al. 2011 is probably a still active mechanism. The deformation of \nthe NE-SW striking thrusts and large segments of the SWIM faults are locked or \naseismic during the quiescence gap of large to mega earthquakes. Aseismic \nslip may be promoted by the serpentinization layer.  \n\nThe NEAREST network recorded some seismic activity below the Gulf of Cadiz \naccretionary wedge. Some focal mechanism solutions show reverse dip-slip \nsolutions compatible with east-dipping subduction zone described in Gutscher \net al. 2002 and Duarte et al., 2013. Note that these events are located outside \nthe deployment area of the NEAREST network and are poorly constrained.   \n\nThe micro-seismicity distribution is also related to the inherited limits of Atlantic \nand Tethys basins. The S\u00e3o Vicente cluster may mark the limit between the \nMesozoic North Atlantic and Western Tethys margins. The Central Atlantic and \nTethys oceans paleo-plate boundary may be aligned with the Horseshoe \nabyssal plain cluster. \n\nV.6.Conclusion \n\nThe main conclusions of this work are:  \n\n? We identified three seismicity clusters located in the areas of the \nGorringe Bank, S\u00e3o Vicente Canyon and along the Horseshoe Abyssal \nplain showing that seismicity is not uniformly distributed in the Gulf of \nCadiz area also as suggested by NEAREST preliminary results (Geissler \net al., 2010) and clustering analysis in Cust\u00f3dio et al, (2016); \n\n? The three seismicity clusters characterized in this work show that the \npresent day micro-seismic activity is generated in the lithospheric mantle \nand concentrates at faults intersections mapped on the sea floor using \nswath bathymetry, suggesting that the crustal fabric may be replicated in \nthe lithospheric mantle; these cluster also show that seismic strain \nconcentrates on fault intersection loci; The inferred fault interference \nzones in the upper mantle are associated with boundaries of lithospheric \ndomains localizing stress and seismic strain; \n\n? Active crustal faults with bathymetric expression, such as the Horseshoe \nand Marqu\u00eas de Pombal faults are either locked or move through slow \naseismic slip. Frictional slip may only result from high magnitude \nearthquakes;  \n\n? Serpentinization controls seismicity distribution by inducing tectonic \ndecoupling and inhibiting micro-seismicity to occur above the \nserpentinized layer. Only during high-magnitude events it is expected \nseismic rupture to propagate upwards across the serpentinized layer up \nto the surface.  \n\n\n\nV. Discussion and conclusion \n \n\n255 \n \n\n? Slip propagation from a non-serpentinized mantle into serpentinized \nmantle is a possible mechanism to produce larger slip areas, due to the \nrelease of pore fluid pressure accumulated during previous aseismic \nevents. This mechanism can account for larger than expected slip for a \nhigh magnitude earthquake, like it is assumed for the 1755 event from \nnumerical modelling of tsunami and inundation (Johnston, 1996, Gradin \net al., 2007, Baptista et al.1998, 2009). \n\nV.7.Future work \n\nSeismological studies: \n\n? Re-locate the NEAREST dataset using the double difference method \n(HypoDD- Waldhouser and Ellsworth, 2000). We tested this method \nduring our study but it needs to be improved. In seismicity distribution \nwith associated clustering, this method may improve events locations. \n\n? Apply the stress tensor inversion to intermediate to high magnitude \nearthquakes reported in the Gulf of Cadiz by land permanent network \nand compare with NEAREST results. The idea is to explore if the stress \ntensors are similar for the different scales of magnitude. This may \nindicate if the mechanism associated with earthquakes generation is the \nsame.  \n\n? Explore in the NEAREST dataset the evidences of low frequency \nearthquakes that can be evidences for fluid fault interactions.  \n\n? OBS networks deployments off-shore SW-W Iberian margins. Temporary \ndeployment result in more accurate measurement of off-shore seismic \nactivity.    \n\nNumerical modelling: \n\n? Test 3D numerical models for the extrapolated mantle fault zones;  \n\n? Create fault plane models incorporating patches of serpentinized mantle \nto explore the influence of this lithology on the slip propagation during \nhigh magnitude earthquakes. Also explore the control of low friction \nlithologies on slip during the seismic cycle (interseismic, coseimic and \npostseismic periods). \n\nGeological/geophysical studies: \n\n? Depth migration of key MCS reflection profiles to study depth extends of \nthe active faults in the study area. In the last decades, as part of different \nEuropean projects (see chapter II), several MCS reflection profiles were \nacquired in Gulf of Cadiz area. Some of these profiles have deep \npenetration, with seismic signal extending down 14s (TWT, e.g IAM MCS \nprofiles). \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n256 \n \n\n? Acquire wide-angle seismic reflection and refraction profiles NE-SW \nacross the Gorringe Bank and the HAP. These profiles would contribute \nto define the lithospheric limits in the study area.\n\n\n\nVI. REFERENCES \n \n\n257 \n \n\nVI.REFERENCES  \n\nAbe, K., 1979.

The source \ndepth was of 10m and the shot interval of 75m. The receivers were distributed \non a streamer with 192 groups with an interval of 25m, with five auxiliary \nchannels. The cable was at a depth of 18m. The in line the near offset was \n254m (Figure A. 1). The streamer length, between the centres of the first and \nlast receivers groups, was 4775m. The sample rate was 4ms and the record \nlength 25s. No low-cut filter was applied in the acquisition system only a high-\ncut filter at 92Hz with a slope of 72dB/oct and a gain constant of 24dB. The \nprimary navigation system was DGPS.  \n\n \nFigure A. 1-.Shooting configuration (adapted to IAM-GB1 configuration from IAM final \nscientific report): sample rate-4ms; record Length:25s; Shot-point interval 75m; number \nof channels 192; group interval 25m; cable depth 18m; near in-line offset:254m \n\nProcessing sequence \n\nThe IAM-GB1 re-processing work was performed using Globe Claritas from \nGNS Science a software package for 2D and 3D land and marine seismic data \nat Barcelona Centre for Subsurface imaging under supervision of the Research \nProfessor C\u00e9sar Ranero. The processing sequence was trace mute; defining in-\nline geometry; trace editing; velocity analysis; de-convolution; stacking; time \nmigration and depth conversion. We used NEAREST P1 refraction velocities to \nconvert time migrated profile in depth.  \n\nDefining in\u2013line geometry \n\nSince no navigation files were available, the geometry was established using \nacquisition parameters, assuming a regular geometry. On most 2D marine \nsurveys it is considered that the cable followed directly behind the boat in a \nstraight line (Figure A. 1). This assumption allows us to have a simple linkage \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n298 \n \n\nbetween the shot point number, the channel number, the offset and the CMP \n(common midpoint) number. The processing sequence is shown in Figure A. 2.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure A. 2-Processing flow to establish in-line geometry \n\nIn the Claritas\u2019 software, the processing steps are defined using work-flows \n(jobs), which include the user defined operations (modules). The first module of \nany job is SEISJOB where is included information on the processing line (e.g \nthe line number).  \n\nThe READSEGY is the module process to import SEGY data into Claritas \nenvironment. The TREMOVE module was used to remove dummy and auxiliary \ntraces. In the current example it was used to exclude auxiliary traces in the \nbeginning of the profile. The selected trace kind was Nonlive, removing all \ntraces with TRTYPE not set to 1 (live seismic data). \n\nThe MGEOM process module of Claritas is designed to set a regular 2D marine \ngeometry (Figure A. 3). It is appropriate to those cases when navigation is not \navailable. The MGEOM reads the information in a geometry file (Figure A. 3) or \ndirectly from more advanced parameters items and defines a linear shot-CMP \n(common midpoint) relationship. We applied the MODE = \"CDP (common depth \npoint) &amp; OFFSET\", i.e. the existing shot-point and channel trace headers were \nused to calculate CDP &amp; OFFSET. Note that although this parameter refers to \nCDP that is only correct if the reflectors are sub-horizontal.   \n\nWe show the different parameters defining the geometry in Figure A. 4, note \nthat the first shot point and CMP were set to 101 and 100, respectively. Finally \nwe used the QSORT module to define marine CMP sort outputs (Figure A. 5). \nShots were the input data and CMPs are output. The geometry for the line was \n\n\n\nVII.

In this context, different processing modules were tested to \nattenuate this noise. Finally, we selected FXDECONV module (Figure A. 7). \nThis module transforms each trace into frequency domain, than a complex \nWiener deconvolution is applied for each frequency in X direction and finally the \ntraces are transformed back into the time domain. \n\n \n\nFigure A. 7- Compare CMP gather before (on the left) and after (on the right) FXDECONV \nrandom noise attenuation \n\nVelocity analysis  \n\nThe velocity analysis was performed in different steps and consumed most of \nthe processing time. We started by creating an initial stack (including only \nCDPTRACES 1-10) using a normal move out correction based in a constant \nvelocity of 1500 km/s and amplitude scaling. In the next step we identified and \npicked the main horizons in the IAM-GB1 line (Figure A. 8). Following we \ngenerated an interval velocity file based on the horizons picking and predefined \nvelocity model based on the previous information on velocities for the area. This \nfile was converted to root mean square (rms) velocities and a new stacking file \nwas generated including all CDPTRACES.  \n\n\n\nStrain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate \nboundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia \n \n\n302 \n \n\n \nFigure A. 8- First stacking with horizons picking \n\nIn the final step we used constant velocity analysis tool in Claritas\u2019 software to \nimprove velocity model using semblance analysis. With this tool we could \nobserve simultaneously in different windows the stacking image, the CMP \ngather and the semblance analysis. In this way we could observe the \nimprovements in normal move out corrections and the effects on stacking \ndisplay. The final velocity model is presented in Figure A. 9. \n\n \nFigure A. 9-Final rms velocity model \n\nFinal stacking: \n\nBefore the final stack we applied to the CMP gather a time-varying and \nspatially-varying predictive deconvolution using DECONW module. The \ndeconvolution is applied to the seismic trace over a set of time gates. The filters \n(one for each time gate) are designed within the design time gates, and are \napplied over the application time gates. These design windows were picked in \nCMP gathers with intervals of 400 CMPs. We tested a different set of filters \n(workflow in Figure A. 10). In Figure A. 11, we compare a fraction of the \nstacking line with and without deconvolution. \n\nBefore the final stack, we applied the NMO correction using the final rms \nvelocity model and a space variant inner trace mute. The final stack is \npresented in Figure A. 12. \n\n\n\nVII.

We started by re-picking seismic horizons in the final stack \n(Figure A. 13). In the next step, we introduced the horizons and the stacking \nvelocity model in Claritas\u2019 isovels application to create an interval velocity model \nand then we smooth this model.  \n\nWe used the FDMIG module to apply a finite difference time migration with the \nabove interval velocity model. The results are presented in Figure A. 14. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nVII. Appendixes \n \n\n305 \n \n\n Depth conversion: \n\nThe TDCONV1 module performs a depth conversion on stacked data using \npreviously defined interval velocities. The velocities were extracted from \nNEAREST refraction profile P1 in the interval of intersection of this profile with \nthe IAM-GB1 line (see Figure A. 15). We converted these data to interval \nvelocities (based on the picked seismic horizons). The velocity model is \npresented in Figure A. 15 and we compare it with previous data extracted from \na parallel refraction profile B-BR in Purdy et al. (1975). In detail, we observe that \nparticularly for intermediate layers and in the IAM-GB1 SW or NE limits, the \nvelocities used are higher. In the central part of the profile, between CMPs 500 \nand 8500, the velocities are more consistent with the work Purdy et al. (1975). \nThe velocity model is also in conformity with the pre-stack velocities in \nintersection area of AR-01 with IAM-GB1 (fig.6 in Rovere et al., 2004 for details \non the velocity model).

Seismicity  of the  northern  Gulf  of Cadiz  was derived  from  an  amphibi-\n\nous  seismological network, including  24  temporary  marine  offshore stations, besides the permanent\n\nnetworks  in Portugal,  Spain,  and  Morocco.  During  the  6 month of the  offshore  network  operation,  in\n\ntotal  86 local  earthquakes  were  located  at six or  more  offshore  stations with  the  majority  of earthquakes\n\noccurring  to the  southwest  of Iberia  and along  the  Algarve  continental  margin off  southern  Iberia. The\n\ndistribution of events  along  the  Algarve  margin mimics features reported  for  the  Atlantic  passive  conti-\n\nnental margins  of  both  South  and  North  America.  Focal  mechanisms  at the  Portim\u00e3o  Bank support  that\n\nseismically active areas  are  associated  with  compression.  Similar stress patterns  are  reported  for  the east\n\ncoast of South and  North  America.  However,  while  earthquakes  along  the  American  east coast occur  at\n\ncrustal  levels, earthquakes  in the  northern  Gulf  of Cadiz  occur  both  in the  lower crust  and  upper mantle,\n\nwith  the  majority  of events rupturing  within  the mantle, including  a  number  of well-located earthquakes\n\nbeneath crust  forming  the  continent-ocean  transition  zone.  The large  number  of earthquakes in the  man-\n\ntle  might  be  caused by  the  unique geological  setting,  where  deformation occurs  in cool lithosphere  of\n\nMesozoic age.  We suggest  that  seismicity along  the  Algarve  margin  is  caused  by  re-activation of pre-\n\nexisting  margin-parallel  faults  rather  than corresponding  to newly  formed  structures  related  to  a new\n\ndeveloping  plate  boundary.\n\n\u00a9 2016 Elsevier  Ltd.

Introduction\n\nThe ocean-continent boundary of southern Iberia to the west\n\nof the Strait of Gibraltar is  defined as a  passive continental mar-\n\ngin, along which the continent and seafloor are  part of the same\n\nplate (Fig. 1). In the framework of plate tectonics (e.g., McKenzie\n\nand Parker, 1967; Morgan, 1968) the interior of plates is defined\n\nas being seismically inactive. However, even stable continental\n\nregions (SCR), including passive continental margins, show occa-\n\nsionally seismic activity. World-wide, Schulte and Mooney (2005)\n\nreported 1371 crustal earthquakes with magnitude larger than\n\n4.5 hitting stable continental lithosphere, with roughly 50% of the\n\nseismicity occurring at Mesozoic passive margins.

It  is  generally believed\n\nthat these events are related to the reactivation of favourably ori-\n\nented pre-existing fault planes in  response to  broad-scale uniform\n\nregional stress fields (Zoback, 1992; Wolin et al., 2012). This idea\n\nis supported by observation that  passive margins are  often reacti-\n\nvated in compression (Cloetingh et al., 2008).\n\nWolin et al. (2012) called the Eastern US passive continental\n\nmargin off  Virginia \u201ca passive-aggressive\u201d margin after on 23rd\n\nof August 2011 a magnitude M =  5.8 hit the town of  Mineral. The\n\nentire eastern coast of North American has a  long record of sev-\n\neral magnitude 6\u20137 earthquakes, including the M =  7.2 1929 Grand\n\nBanks earthquake, causing a  landslide and tsunami (Bent, 1995).\n\nIn addition to far-field stresses, glacial isostatic rebound has been\n\nsuggested to control earthquakes at passive margins. However, far-\n\nther south along the margin of eastern Brazil earthquakes with\n\nmagnitudes of larger than 5 occur every 20\u201325 years (Assumpcao\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jog.2016.06.001\n\n0264-3707/\u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

(2010).\n\net al., 2011), indicating that forces other than isostatic adjustments\n\ncontribute to control seismicity along passive margins.\n\nPassive continental margins occur generally several thousands\n\nof kilometres away from major plate boundary faults. The southern\n\npassive margin of Iberia, including the Algarve margin, however, is\n\nlocated near or at the Azores-Gibraltar seismic zone, marking the\n\nplate boundary between Eurasia/Iberia and Africa. To the east of\n\n14?W the plate boundary is not  well defined and seismicity is  rather\n\ndiffuse (Sartori et al., 1994; Buforn et al., 2004)  and the WNW-ESE\n\nplate convergence of ?4 mm/yr (DeMets et al., 2010)  is accommo-\n\ndated through widespread tectonically active deformation (Sartori\n\net al., 1994; Hayward et al., 1999). Consequently, convergence may\n\nhave caused Neogene to Quaternary reactivation of Mesozoic rifting\n\nstructures (Zitellini et al., 2004), which in turn may  control tectonic\n\nand seismic activity along the passive margin of southern Iberia and\n\nin the Gulf of Cadiz (e.g., Borges et al., 2001; Buforn et al., 2004; Stich\n\net al., 2005).\n\nBathymetric and multi-channel seismic (MCS) data suggest that\n\ntoday\u2019s plate boundary might be defined by  a  set of WNW-ESE\n\ntrending faults (called the South-West Iberia Margin or SWIM\n\nfaults; Zitellini et al., 2009; Bartolome et al., 2012), running to\n\nthe south of ?36?N. In this scenario the seismicity paralleling\n\nthe Algarve margin might not be related to a  newly develop-\n\ning plate boundary, but still might be associated with far-field\n\nstresses caused by  convergence. In a  scenario of active westward\n\nretreat of a narrow slab (e.g., Gutscher, 2004; Gutscher et al., 2012)\n\nhanging under the western Alboran Sea and the southern Betics\n\n(Gutscher et al., 2002; Garcia-Castellanos and Villasen?or, 2011)\n\nseismicity along the Algarve margin might be caused by a  so called\n\nSubduction-Transform Edge Propagator, or STEP fault (Govers and\n\nWortel, 2005).\n\nHere, we  report results from a  large amphibious seismic net-\n\nwork, including 24 offshore ocean-bottom-seismometers (OBS)\n\ninstalled in the Gulf of Cadiz to the north of 35?25?N and east of\n\n9?30?W (Figs. 1 and 2). The network allows robust source estimates\n\nof offshore seismicity and hence may  yield constraints on the active\n\ndeformation of crust und upper mantle of the reactivated Mesozoic\n\npassive margin and seismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz. Our interpre-\n\ntations are  nurtured by a  new seismic refraction and wide-angle\n\nprofile shot in  the area (Sallares et al., 2011) that provides robust\n\nestimates on the nature of crust underlying the Gulf of Cadiz sed-\n\nimentary prism and the southern Iberian continental margin. We\n\nwill discuss micro-earthquake activity in  the Gulf of Cadiz with\n\nrespect to different tectonic settings, including other passive conti-\n\nnental margins like  the east coast of both North and South America.\n\nHowever, seismicity might be controlled by a  newly developing\n\nplate boundary and we will hence discuss features with respect to\n\na  reorientation of the Eurasian-African plate boundary. Further, the\n\nseismicity pattern derived from the deployment will be discussed\n\nwith respect to scenarios envisioning either active eastward dip-\n\nping subduction (Gutscher et al., 2002) or active strike-slip faulting\n\nalong the SWIM faults (e.g, Zitellini et al., 2009; Bartolome et al.,\n\n2012; Duarte et al., 2011).\n\n2. Tectonic setting\n\nIn  the Gulf  of Cadiz to  the west of the Gibraltar Arc, the plate\n\nboundary between Eurasia and Africa is rather poorly defined.\n\nInstead, WNW-ESE plate convergence of 4 mm/yr (DeMets et al.,\n\n2010)  is accommodated over a wide and diffuse deformation zone\n\n(Sartori et al., 1994; Hayward et al., 1999),  following a  large scale\n\nstrain partitioning scenario (Terrinha et al., 2009) and showing sig-\n\ndx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jog.2016.06.001\n\n\nPlease cite this article in press as: Grevemeyer, I., et al., Mantle earthquakes beneath the South Iberia continental margin and Gulf of\n\nCadiz \u2013 constraints from an onshore-offshore seismological network.

The region is  also char-\n\nacterized by large earthquakes and tsunamis, such as the Great\n\nLisbon earthquake of 1st of November 1755 with an estimated mag-\n\nnitude of Mw ? 8.5\u20138.8 (Martinez-Solares et al., 1979; Johnston,\n\n1996) and the 1969 Mw  =  7.9 Horseshoe Abyssal Plain earthquake\n\n(Fukao, 1973).\n\nCrustal domains in  the central Gulf of Cadiz and at the Mesozoic\n\ncontinental margin of the Algarve, Southern Portugal/Iberia, can be\n\ndefined by seismic refraction and wide-angle data (Sallares et al.,\n\n2011; Martinez-Loriente et al., 2014; Fig. 1), indicating 28\u201330 km\n\nthick continental crust near the coast line, a  60 km wide transition\n\nzone, where the crust thins to ?20 km, and a 7 km thick oceanic\n\ncrust roughly 100\u2013120 km  off the coast (Fig. 1). The passive mar-\n\ngin of southern Iberia and the Algarve formed during the Triassic\n\nbreakup of Pangea (Heymann, 1989). However, oceanic crust floor-\n\ning the Gulf of Cadiz postdates margin formation. Plate tectonic\n\nmodels (e.g., Schettino and Turco, 2011) suggests that between\n\n185 Ma and ?145 Ma rifting between Africa and North America\n\nopened the Atlantic while farther east the Tethys ocean formed.\n\nPlate motion caused by  the opening of the Atlantic was transferred\n\nto the Tethyan realm through a  system of transform faults between\n\nIberia and Morocco. Sallares et al. (2011) suggested that oceanic\n\ncrustal formation occurred at the end of the opening of the Tethys\n\nat ?145 Ma,  probably by oblique sinistral seafloor spreading which\n\nceased when Newfoundland broke apart from Western Iberia at\n\n?130 Ma.\n\nPlate reconstructions suggest that convergence between Africa\n\nand Eurasia started between 120 to 83 Ma.  From the Paleocene to\n\nEocene, African and Eurasian convergence was mostly accommo-\n\ndated in the Alpine collision zone. Since about 35 Ma the western\n\nMediterranean and the Gibraltar arc were affected by slab roll-\n\nback (Royden, 1993; Faccenna et al., 2001; Spakman and Wortel,\n\n2004). Geodynamic modelling suggests that northward subduction\n\noccurred initially at the Balearic margin. At about 30 Ma, the trench\n\nand subduction rotated and westward slab roll-back occurred until\n\nTortonian, suggesting that both subduction and slab roll back is\n\nstalled since 8 Ma (Chertova et al., 2014).\n\nToday, the main morphotectonic feature of the Gulf of  Cadiz\n\nis the up to 10 km  thick sedimentary wedge (e.g., Thiebot and\n\nGutscher, 2006). Its formation is  still controversially discussed. The\n\nwedge itself is  formed by large allochthonous masses with seismi-\n\ncally chaotic reflections at the forefront of the Gibraltar Arc (e.g.,\n\nTorelli et al., 1997; Maldonado et al., 1999; Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003;\n\nRovere et al., 2004). The chaotic sedimentary melange shows signs\n\nof intense deformation and westward transport, attributed primar-\n\nily to wrench faulting between Africa and Eurasia as well as gravity\n\nsliding (Torelli et al., 1997; Maldonado et al., 1999). However, the\n\nobserved features can also be interpreted as accretionary complex\n\nof an eastward dipping subduction zone (e.g., Gutscher et al., 2002),\n\nsupporting the tectonic framework introduced above. Miocene\n\neastward subduction is  supported by ample evidence, including\n\narc-formation in  the Alboran Sea (Duggen et al., 2003, 2004; Booth-\n\nRea et al., 2007) and seismological imaging of a subducted slab\n\nand intermediate seismicity under the West Alboran Sea (Gutscher\n\net al., 2002; Garcia-Castellanos and Villasen?or, 2011; Grevemeyer\n\net al., 2015) and mantle flow (D\u00edaz and Gallart, 2014). Gutscher et al.\n\n(2006) suggested that still active subduction may  have caused the\n\nGreat Lisbon earthquake of 1755. However, deformation pattern\n\nand geodynamic modelling may  suggest that subduction is stalled\n\nsince Tortonian (e.g., Iribarren et al., 2007; Chertova et al., 2014).\n\nSimulations of seismic ground motions of the Great Lisbon\n\nearthquake favour a source to the west of Cape Sao Vicente (Grandin\n\net al., 2007) in the Horseshoe abyssal plain or at the Gorringe Bank\n\n(Johnston, 1996). Baptista et al. (1998, 2011) analyzed all evidences\n\non the 1755 tsunami and concluded that  wave amplitudes and\n\ntsunami travel times estimated from historical records are best\n\nexplained by a tectonic source in the SW of Iberia closer to  the\n\ncoast, excluding the Gorringe Bank and Gulf of Cadiz accretionary\n\nwedge as possible sources.\n\nHigh-resolution bathymetric mapping of the Gulf of  Cadiz and\n\nthe adjacent Horseshoe abyssal plain indicated a  set of almost linear\n\nand sub parallel dextral strike\u2013slip faults, the South-West-Iberia-\n\nMargin or SWIM faults (Zitellini et al., 2009). The features form a\n\nnarrow band of deformation over a  length of 600 km and roughly\n\ncoincide with a  small circle centred on the pole of rotation of Africa\n\nwith respect to Eurasia.

(2009) suggested that  the\n\ndx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jog.2016.06.001\n\n\nPlease cite this article in press as: Grevemeyer, I.,  et al., Mantle earthquakes beneath the South Iberia continental margin and Gulf of\n\nCadiz \u2013 constraints from an onshore-offshore seismological network.

Seismic\n\nreflection imaging revealed that the SWIM lineaments cut  down to\n\nat least 10 km (Bartolome et al., 2012). Terrinha et al. (2009) and\n\nDuarte et al. (2011) suggest that the lineaments represent the reac-\n\ntivation of Mesocoic faults that root in the underlying basement.\n\nSeismically neither the SWIM lineaments nor the proposed Gulf\n\nof Cadiz subduction thrust showed any prominent seismic activity\n\ndetectable utilizing onshore seismic monitoring (e.g., Buforn et al.,\n\n2004; Stich et al., 2005).\n\n3. Seismological data and methodology\n\n3.1. Data\n\nIn the Gulf of  Cadiz 24 ocean-bottom-seismometers (OBS) were\n\ndeployed along the southern Iberian continental margin and on the\n\nGulf of Cadiz accretionary wedge (Figs. 1 and 2). The deployment\n\nwas part of the European Science Foundation (ESF) coordinated\n\nprogramme TOPO-Europe. Marine deployments of our  exercise,\n\ncalled TOPO-MED, were supplemented by  the permanent seismic\n\nnetworks operated in Portugal, Spain, and Morocco (Fig. 2).\n\nThe offshore network was operated between 20th of January\n\n2010 and 21st of July 2010. The network consisted of 24\n\nOBS, including 5 wide-band OBS operating a three-component\n\nGuralp CMG-40T (60 s) seismometer and a HighTech HTI-04-\n\nPCA/ULF hydrophone from the German DEPAS pool. In addition,\n\n19 GEOMAR-OBS, equipped with a  hydrophone and 3-compenent\n\nshort-period seismometers with a  natural frequency of 4.5 Hz,\n\nwere operated. Seismic events were detected automatically in\n\nthe continuous OBS record using a short-term-average versus a\n\nlong-term-average (STA/LTA) triggering approach. We  used a STA\n\nwindow of 0.5 s and a  LTA window of 60 s. The trigger ratio was\n\n4.0 and the de-trigger ratio was 2.5. The trigger parameters were\n\napplied to unfiltered vertical component data. We consider a  trig-\n\nger to be an earthquake when it was detected on six  or  more OBS\n\nstations. Visual inspection of the data suggested that we obtained\n\ngenerally less than ?5% false triggers and lose only those events that\n\nwere recorded on a  few stations and characterized by a  poor signal\n\nnoise ratio, while all major events were included. Surprisingly, only\n\na reasonable small number of&lt;100 events was detected and the\n\ndetected events generally coincide with earthquakes reported in\n\nthe national catalogue of Portugal. We believe that the up to 12 km\n\nthick sedimentary prism (Thiebot and Gutscher, 2006)  caused a\n\nvery high attenuation. Further, the area is  inherently affected by\n\nstrong noise caused by ship\u2019s traffic through the Strait of Gibral-\n\ntar (Fig. 3), requiring earthquakes with magnitudes of larger ?2\n\nto be detected within the offshore network. This interpretation is\n\nsupported by the fact that the smallest magnitude of local earth-\n\nquakes was roughly one order of magnitude larger than for an\n\nOBS network operated in the Alboran Sea to  the east of Gibral-\n\ntar (Grevemeyer et al., 2015). The OBS farthest to the east, sitting\n\non the thickest portion of the prism, provided the smallest num-\n\nber of readings of local earthquakes, supporting the interpretation\n\nthat thicker sediments provide higher attenuation. However, the\n\nOBS network detected all offshore events occurring within the net-\n\nwork that were reported in  either the catalogue of the Instituto\n\nPortugu\u00eas do Mar  e da Atmosfera (IPMA, Portugal) or the Spanish\n\nInstituto Geografico Nacional (IGN, Spain). In addition, four and six\n\nadditional events were detected with respect to  the IPMA and IGN\n\ncatalogue, respectively.\n\nAll events were registered into a SEISAN database (Havskov\n\nand Ottem\u00f6ller, 2000),  using a  3 min  long time window from\n\nthe continuous OBS records and data from the Portuguese net-\n\nFig. 3. Power Spectral Density (PSD) of OBS36 (red line) in the Gulf of Cadiz and an\n\nOBS deployed at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) near 15? N (black line). Note the much\n\nhigher noise level observed in the Gulf of Cadiz. It might be reasonable to  suggest\n\nthat strong noise from ship\u2019s traffic affected seismic recordings, resulting in a  much\n\nlower detection of small earthquakes with respect to  quieter settings.

P-wave and S-wave\n\narrival times were hand-picked. In total, we obtained 86  local\n\nearthquakes from the Gulf of Cadiz and adjacent domains. The\n\nreading weighting scheme ranges from factor 0,  corresponding to\n\nthe lowest uncertainty (\u00b10.05 s), to factor 4 (>0.3 s) for doubtful\n\nreadings that were not used. The total average P wave reading\n\nerror is estimated at \u00b10.12 s. Latter, additional onset times from\n\nland stations in  Spain and Morocco were added to  the database\n\n(http://www.isc.ac.uk/iscbulletin/search/bulletin).\n\n3.2. Location procedure and velocity models\n\nTo constrain epicentres and focal depth we surveyed four dif-\n\nferent 1D velocity models and used two different algorithms.\n\nEarthquakes were located (1) with the program HYPOCENTER,\n\nwhich employs an iterative solution to the nonlinear localization\n\nproblem (Lienert et al., 1986; Lienert and Havskov, 1995) and (2)\n\nusing the non-linear probabilistic location procedure NonLinLoc of\n\nLomax et al. (2000). Unfortunately, the number of events within the\n\nnetwork was too small to  derived robust station corrections. We\n\ntherefore used for both location procedures station elevations to\n\nconstrain differences in topography between onshore and offshore\n\ndomains.\n\nLocating earthquakes in  the Gulf of Cadiz using a  1-D reference\n\nmodel is a  difficult task since crustal thickness for onshore stations\n\nwill be in the order of 30 km while OBS on the prism will sit on thin\n\noceanic crust covered by 3\u20138 km of sediments. We  therefore uti-\n\nlized different velocity models and location algorithms to provide\n\nan effective way to explore the uncertainties associated with each\n\nearthquake and the bias caused by different velocity models. For\n\nevent location we used (i) the global AK135 model (Kennett et al.,\n\n1995), (ii) the model that Geissler et al. (2010) used to  locate local\n\nearthquakes to the SW of Portugal (Fig. 4a, red line; called G-16);\n\n(iii) the velocity structure to the north of the Portim\u00e3o Bank (Fig. 4a,\n\nblue line; called OBS-Portim\u00e3o) derived from 2-D seismic refrac-\n\ntion data (Sallares et al., 2011), representing extended continental\n\ncrust, and (iv) the velocity structure of the distal imbricated wedge\n\nderived from 2-D  seismic refraction data (Sallares et al., 2011),\n\nrepresenting Jurassic oceanic crust covered by 5 km of sediment\n\n(Fig. 4a, green line; called OBS-prism).\n\nIn  the individual location procedures, most earthquakes pro-\n\nduced formal errors of \u00b10.5\u20132 km for the epicentre and \u00b12\u20135 km\n\ndx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jog.2016.06.001\n\n\nPlease cite this article in press as: Grevemeyer, I., et al., Mantle earthquakes beneath the South Iberia continental margin and Gulf of\n\nCadiz \u2013 constraints from an onshore-offshore seismological network.

However, deeper earthquakes (>30 km)  may  have\n\nlarger epicentral errors of \u00b12\u20134 km  and \u00b13\u20138 km in focal depth\n\n(Fig. 4). Overall, seismic events with good azimuthal coverage pro-\n\nvided very similar depth estimates, like two very well located thrust\n\nevents at the Portim\u00e3o Bank. The events occurred clearly within the\n\nupper mantle at 30\u201345 km  (Figs. 4 and 5). Depending on the velocity\n\nstructure used for event location, event depth may  vary by ?10 km\n\nand epicentral locations may  vary in the order of 2\u201320 km. How-\n\never, in a map  view, changes of epicentres were generally minor.\n\nWith respect to depth, changes are much more significant. The\n\nAK135 model provided the most compact depth distribution of all\n\nvelocity models (Fig. 6a) with basically all earthquakes occurring\n\nin the upper mantle. However, both crustal thickness and mantle\n\nvelocity poorly match constraints from seismic data in the area. In\n\nfact AK135 includes a  much thicker crust and faster mantle velocity\n\nthan observed off SW Iberia (e.g., Sallares et al., 2011). The model G-\n\n16 of Geissler et al. (2010) approximates the onshore and offshore\n\ndomains by using a  crustal thickness of 16 km,  which is  thinner than\n\nthe crust of Iberia but thicker than the Jurassic oceanic crust sam-\n\npled offshore (Sallares et al., 2011). In general, depth distribution\n\nof earthquakes is rather compact, ranging from ?5 km to  ?45 km\n\n(Fig. 6b). Thus, earthquakes occur both in the crust and upper man-\n\ntle. The model OBS-Portim\u00e3o has a  crustal thickness of 28 km and\n\na continental crust-type velocity structure. Depth distribution of\n\nearthquakes is similar to the model G-16, but showed a  wider range\n\nin depth (Fig. 6c).  The model OBS-prism has approximately 5 km\n\nof sediments covering 7 km of oceanic crust. The depth distribu-\n\ntion is scattered over a  much larger depth range (Fig. 6d). With\n\nrespect to the average rms  fit all four models provided in the Non-\n\nLinLoc location procedure rather similar fits. Due to its compactness\n\nof  depth distribution, we  prefer the model G-16. The fact that all\n\nmodels provide evidence for earthquakes rupturing at 30\u201350 km\n\ndepth clearly supports the fact that a  large number of earthquakes\n\noccurred within the mantle of the continental domain as defined\n\nby Martinez-Loriente et al. (2014, Fig. 1).\n\nThe seismic velocity models constrained only the P-wave veloc-\n\nity structure. To constrain Vp/Vs ratios, we used Wadati diagrams\n\n(S-P time versus P  time) and calculated an average Vp/Vs ratio\n\n(Havskov and Ottem\u00f6ller, 2000). To constrain the Vp/Vs ratio we\n\nused 81 earthquakes with at least eight P-wave and S-wave pairs,\n\na  rms  event location misfit of 0.3 or better, and a  correlation coeffi-\n\ncient of the fit of S-P time versus P time of >0.9. The resulting Vp/Vs\n\nratio was 1.68.\n\nTo explore the benefit of having an amphibious network, we\n\nremoved the OBS arrival times from the catalogue and re-located\n\nthe events. For most offshore events the uncertainty increased and\n\nerrors are  doubled or  even tripled. As an example Fig. 5 shows\n\nthe two thrust events of 5 and 18 of May of 2010. Removing the\n\noffshore stations, epicentres are  shifted 5\u201310 km  to the southwest\n\nand the probability-density-function (PDF) is smeared in SW-NE\n\ndirection, indicating uncertainties of \u00b15\u20138 km.  In depth, the PDF\n\nfor the first event is not well defined (non Gaussian distribution)\n\nand uncertainties are in  the order of \u00b110\u201315 km.  For  the second\n\nevent, the preferred depth estimate would be at 20 km rather\n\nthan at 38 km.  Like for the previous event, uncertainties are in\n\nthe order \u00b110\u201315 km.  Thus, offshore seismometers clearly improve\n\nthe quality of event locations. Therefore, constraints from onshore\n\nnetworks alone might be  profoundly biased. Supplementary Fig.\n\nS1 shows the mis-location between regional catalogues and our\n\nestimates as a  function of offset from the margin.\n\ndx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jog.2016.06.001\n\n\nPlease cite this article in press as: Grevemeyer, I., et al., Mantle earthquakes beneath the South Iberia continental margin and Gulf of\n\nCadiz \u2013 constraints from an onshore-offshore seismological network.

Here, we  report only 6 mechanisms\n\nwhere both approaches provided similar solutions (Table 1).\n\n4. Results\n\n4.1. Distribution of seismicity\n\nSeismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz and to the southwest of Portugal\n\nis not evenly distributed in space but highly clustered. During the\n\ndeployment about half of the observed seismicity occurred to  the\n\nwest of the network, including areas of major activity at the Gor-\n\nringe Bank, at the Sao  Vicente Canyon to the south of the Cape Sao\n\nVicente, and across the Horseshoe fault.\n\nThe area of largest activity well covered by the network occurred\n\nalong the continental margin of southern Iberia to the north of 36?N,\n\nincluding a number of Mw > 3 earthquakes at or in  the vicinity of the\n\nPortim\u00e3o Bank offshore the Algarve (Fig. 2). With a  depth range of\n\n15 to ?40 km,  the majority of hypocentres occurred both within\n\nthe lower crust and upper mantle. The two strongest and best\n\nlocated events occurred at >30 km depth (independent of veloc-\n\nity model) and hence within the uppermost mantle (Figs. 4 and 5).\n\nFig. 7 shows earthquakes to the east of 9?30?W (located with model\n\nG-16) projected on to the seismic refraction and wide-angle pro-\n\nfile of Sallares et al. (2011). Interestingly, all earthquakes occurred\n\nbelow the 5-km/s-contour line, suggesting that earthquakes occur\n\nwithin the basement and preferentially in the lower continental\n\ncrust and uppermost mantle. Due to structural heterogeneities in\n\nthe area and the fact that a  1-D  reference model was used to locate\n\nthe events, we carried out the same exercise using the other velocity\n\nmodels (Supplementary Fig. 3). Overall, the features are very sim-\n\nilar, supporting that the majority of earthquakes ruptured either\n\nin the lower crust or upper mantle. However, as indicated by the\n\nhistograms in Fig. 6, the portion of earthquakes at mantle depth\n\nincreases using either a  thicker crust or global model.\n\nOn 22 of April 2010 the largest recorded event occurred roughly\n\n100 km to the east of the marine network at the Moroccan coast\n\nline near the seismic station TSY. The earthquake with a  magni-\n\ntude of mb = 4.5 was recorded on nearly all stations of the network.\n\nThe large spacing of seismic stations near the epicentre resulted\n\nin large uncertainties of focal depth. However, like  the Interna-\n\ntional Seismological Centre (ISC) (http://www.isc.ac.uk/iscbulletin/\n\nsearch/bulletin) we  located the event within the mantle at >40 km.\n\nAn interesting feature is  the almost lack of seismicity to  the\n\nsouth of 36?N where sediment is  thickest and the eastward dipping\n\nsubduction thrust has been imaged (Gutscher et al., 2002). Thus,\n\nbasically all earthquakes occurred to the north of the 5\u201312 km thick\n\naccretionary prism (Fig.  8a). Furthermore, in the same area major\n\nstrike slip faults (Zitellini et al., 2009; Bartolome et al., 2012)  have\n\nbeen deduced from bathymetric and seismic data (labelled SWIM1\n\nand SWIM2  in Figs. 1 and 2). However, over the six month of net-\n\nwork operation little evidence for seismogenic slip along the faults\n\nwas observed. Just to the west of OBS39 and OBS41, some seismic-\n\nity might be associated with the SWIM1  fault. Trade-offs between\n\nepicentral location and focal depth cause too large uncertainties to\n\ndraw any robust conclusions regarding these particular events.\n\nMost earthquakes along the margin might be related to  the\n\nstructure of the margin. Gr\u00e0cia et al. (2003) highlighted a promi-\n\nnent SW-NE striking gravity anomaly \u2013 the Guadalquivir-Portimao\n\nlineament \u2013 terminating at the Portim\u00e3o Bank. Most earthquakes\n\nat the margin seem to occur in  the vicinity of this anomaly (Fig. 8b),\n\nsuggesting that the structure of the margin controls the distribu-\n\ntion of seismicity. Plotting data obtained from regional catalogues,\n\nlike the IPMA or IGN seismic bulletins, provide basically the same\n\npattern (Fig. 8c and d).\n\n4.2. Stress pattern\n\nFocal mechanisms were derived for six earthquakes. In the vicin-\n\nity of the Portim\u00e3o Bank thrusting dominates (Fig. 2).  However, the\n\nsame stress pattern may  be compatible with two  sets of conjugate\n\nfaults, both accommodating general N-S trending shortening. To\n\nthe northwest of the Portim\u00e3o Bank two strike-slip events were\n\ndeduced (Fig. 2). Overall, focal mechanisms and hence stress pat-\n\ntern mimic features observed in  previous studies (e.g., Borges et al.,\n\n2001; Stich et al., 2005).\n\n5. Discussion\n\n5.1. Seismicity to the southwest of Portugal\n\nThe seismicity reported routinely by the Portuguese IPMA or\n\nthe Spanish IGN shows clustered seismicity at Gorringe Bank and\n\nat the Sao Vicente Canyon, indicating different active fault systems\n\n(e.g., Geissler et al., 2010). All  areas showed seismic activity during\n\nthe 6 month of network operation. Unfortunately, events recorded\n\nat both the Gorringe Bank and at the Horseshoe Fault where well\n\noutside of the network and hence hypocentral parameters have\n\ntoo large uncertainties. Trade-offs between focal depth and epi-\n\ncentral distance prevent robust estimates of either focal depth or\n\nstress pattern. However, due to its proximity to  seismic stations\n\nin  Portugal and the marine network, seismicity at the Sao Vicente\n\nCanyon can be studied in  much more detail. Over the deployment\n\nperiod we recorded more than 20 earthquakes that clustered near\n\nthe southwestern terminus of the canyon, making it one of the seis-\n\nmically most active sites. Focal depth of 20\u201340 km indicates that\n\nseismicity is generally located within the mantle. Geissler et al.\n\n(2010) located earthquakes in the vicinity of the Sao Vicente fault\n\nat a  greater depth of 40\u201355 km.  Focal mechanism and stress ten-\n\nsor inversion of Geissler et al. (2010) yielded an obliquely oriented\n\ncompressive regime. The single focal mechanisms obtained during\n\nour deployment supports the stress pattern observed previously.\n\n5.2. Seismicity of the southern Iberia continental margin\n\nThe northern Gulf of Cadiz has been divided into an inner part\n\n(off the city of Cadiz), a middle part with the Guadalquivir Bank, and\n\nan outer part with the Portim\u00e3o Bank (Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003). The outer\n\npart is characterized by a  rough topography and is  dominated by\n\nlarge submarine canyons that are  deeply incised in platformal areas.\n\nTo the south, both the Portim\u00e3o Bank and Guadalquivir Bank show\n\nthrust faults (Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003). During the marine deployment,\n\nthe middle and outer part of the Gulf of Cadiz were seismically\n\nvery active. Three thrust faulting events occurred at the Portim\u00e3o\n\nBank and focal depth of the thrust events clearly support that they\n\nrupture within the mantle (Figs. 4, 5 and 7). Based on bathymetric\n\nand seismic data, it has been suggested that the Bank is  bounded\n\nat both flanks by thrust faults (Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003; Terrinha et al.,\n\n2009). Sallares et al. (2011) found southward dipping seismic veloc-\n\nity anomalies that were interpreted as crustal scale normal faults\n\nformed during the formation of the passive margin in  the Meso-\n\nzoic. It  might be  reasonable to  suggest that these faults cut into the\n\nmantle and are reactivated in  response to the convergence between\n\nAfrica and Eurasia as thrusts.\n\nFor the US east coast stress pattern indicated roughly margin\n\nparallel compression (Zoback, 1992), which is similar to stresses\n\ncaused by modelled intraplate stresses due to  plate-wide forces.\n\nEarthquakes along the eastern continental margin of the US are\n\ngenerally believed to reflect reactivation of ancient faults (Wolin\n\net al., 2012). Along the Iberian margin, Zitellini et al. (2004) sug-\n\ngested that seismic activity occurs along reactivated Mesozoic rift\n\ndx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jog.2016.06.001\nhttp://www.isc.ac.uk/iscbulletin/search/bulletin\nhttp://www.isc.ac.uk/iscbulletin/search/bulletin\nhttp://www.isc.ac.uk/iscbulletin/search/bulletin\nhttp://www.isc.ac.uk/iscbulletin/search/bulletin\nhttp://www.isc.ac.uk/iscbulletin/search/bulletin\nhttp://www.isc.ac.uk/iscbulletin/search/bulletin\nhttp://www.isc.ac.uk/iscbulletin/search/bulletin\nhttp://www.isc.ac.uk/iscbulletin/search/bulletin\n\n\nPlease cite this article in press as: Grevemeyer, I., et al., Mantle earthquakes beneath the South Iberia continental margin and Gulf of\n\nCadiz \u2013 constraints from an onshore-offshore seismological network.

Thus, earthquakes along the south Iberian continental\n\nmargin mimic  stresses and features envisioned for the US east coast.\n\nThe increased seismicity rate for the Iberian margin, however, may\n\nreflect its proximity to the African/Eurasian plate boundary.\n\nThe main difference, however, is the much larger focal depth\n\nof most earthquakes reported in  our study. Typical earthquakes\n\nalong passive continental margins, like the 23rd August 2011 Min-\n\neral, Virginia event (Wolin et al., 2012) or the 23rd April 2008 Sao\n\nVicente, Brazil event (Assumpcao et al., 2011), occurred within the\n\ncrust. In contrast, earthquakes along the southern Iberia margin\n\noccurred predominately within the mantle. We hypothesize that\n\nthis feature is caused by the proximity to the plate boundary and\n\nby an elastic rheology of the continent-ocean transition zone (see\n\ndiscussion below).\n\nOverall, our new depth estimates support previous results\n\nobtained from global catalogues and regional waveform modelling\n\n(Stich et al., 2005), showing seismicity both in  the crust and upper\n\nmantle. However, events as deep as 60 km, that were previously\n\nreported (Stich et al., 2005), have not  been observed during our\n\ndeployment. The stress pattern derived from the amphibious net-\n\nwork support features obtained previously (e.g., Borges et al., 2001;\n\nStich et al., 2005), suggesting that the Southern Iberian margin\n\nis under horizontal compression. However, there is not a domi-\n\nnant faulting regime, hence reverse, strike-slip, and normal faulting\n\nmechanisms coexist in the Gulf of Cadiz and SW Iberia (e.g., Borges\n\net al., 2001; Buforn et al., 2004; Stich et al., 2005; Geissler et al.,\n\n2010). Terrinha et al. (2009) suggested that such pattern might be\n\nrelated to convergence and strain partitioning by  means of dextral\n\nwrenching on WNW-ESE trending steep faults and thrusting on the\n\nNE-SW trending fault  in the Gulf of Cadiz and Horseshoe Abyssal\n\nPlain. Approaching the base of the continental slope, NNE-SSW to\n\nN-S westerly dipping thrusts accommodate shortening in  an area\n\nwhere wrenching has not been observed.\n\n5.3. Rheology of crust and mantle\n\nIn continental lithosphere it has been observed that during rift-\n\ning the upper crust is  deformed by faulting while the lower crust\n\ngenerally supports ductile deformation (e.g., Odedra et al., 2001;\n\nMoeller et al., 2013). The transition from brittle to ductile defor-\n\nmation depends on the temperature structure and the rock type.\n\nEarthquakes are generally restricted to domains of brittle defor-\n\nmation. The fact that earthquakes in  the Gulf of Cadiz occur within\n\nthe lower crust and the upper mantle supports elastic rheology for\n\nboth domains. Thus, both the lower crust and upper mantle are\n\nstrong. This interpretation is supported by very low crustal heat\n\nflow of&lt;50 mW/m2 (Grevemeyer et al., 2009), resulting in cooler\n\ngeotherms than generally found in rift basins (e.g., McKenzie, 1978)\n\nand hence favouring elastic rheology.\n\nBrittle deformation in the oceanic mantle is a  common features\n\nand generally restricted to temperatures&lt;600 ?C (e.g., McKenzie\n\net al., 2005; Craig et al., 2014). Thus, only near mid-ocean ridges is\n\nseismicity confined to crustal levels (e.g., Grevemeyer et al., 2013).\n\nCrustal deformation of mature oceanic lithosphere may  cause brit-\n\ntle deformation to extend until depths of several tens of kilometres\n\ninto the mantle (Lefeldt et al., 2009; Craig et al., 2014). In  our study\n\nthe majority of earthquakes rupturing within the mantle occurred\n\nlandward of the domain of Jurassic oceanic crust, either in  the\n\n60-km-wide continent-ocean transition zone or in the continen-\n\ntal domain near the coast line as defined by seismic data (Sallares\n\net al., 2011; Martinez-Loriente et al., 2014;  Fig.  1).\n\nEarthquakes in  the continental domain of the South Iberia mar-\n\ngin are focused in the lower crust and uppermost mantle. Neves and\n\nNeves (2009) suggested that flexural loading caused by density con-\n\ntrasts between adjacent oceanic and continental crust may  cause\n\nflexure and hence deformation. In their model compressive stresses\n\nand deformation concentrates below Moho. However, some of  the\n\nbest located earthquakes occur in the continent-ocean transitions\n\nzone (line-km 160\u2013190 in Fig. 5) at ?40 km depth where the flex-\n\nural model of Neves and Neves (2009) predicts tensile stresses. In\n\ncontrast, observed focal mechanisms support thrusting and hence\n\ncompression.\n\nSeismicity and brittle deformation in both oceanic and continen-\n\ntal mantle off  southern Iberia seems to be a common feature and\n\nhave been revealed using a wide range of techniques, including\n\nregional waveform modelling (Stich et al., 2005) and local moni-\n\ntoring of seismicity using our amphibious network. Elsewhere in\n\ncontinental lithosphere earthquakes occurring at mantle depth are\n\nknown to  be  rare. It was therefore inferred that the continental\n\nmantle is  rather weak and probably related to higher water content\n\n(Maggi et al., 2000). Mantle earthquakes, however, were detected\n\nbeneath the East African Rift at 53\u201360 km  (Lindenfeld and R\u00fcmpker,\n\n2011), but might be associated to  deep-seated magmatic processes.\n\nRecently, Alinaghi and Kr\u00fcger (2014) confirmed the occurrence\n\nof some earthquakes in continental mantle below the Tien Shan,\n\nCentral Asia, supporting a strong lower crust and upper mantle.\n\n5.4. Seismic quiescence of the Gulf of Cadiz sedimentary prism\n\nand SWIM faults\n\nA large number of ocean-bottom-seismometers was  placed on\n\nthe accretionary prism of the Gulf of Cadiz (Fig. 2; Gutscher et al.,\n\n2002; Thiebot and Gutscher, 2006). Seismically the area remained\n\ninactive, both during the time of our deployment and during the\n\nmuch longer time scale of seismicity recorded by national networks\n\nin Portugal and Spain (Fig. 8).  Seven OBS (no. 37\u201343) where located\n\non top of the main SWIM fault running through the centre of the\n\nGulf (labelled SWIM1  in  Figs. 1 and 2). These stations were deployed\n\nas a dense array with a  station separation of&lt;10 km.  Nevertheless,\n\nthey did not reveal any earthquakes within the network that cluster\n\nalong the fault. However, some events farther west but outside of\n\nthe network might be associated with the SWIM1  fault. One inter-\n\npretation would be that  both the subduction thrust and the SWIM\n\nfaults are  largely inactive. However, large strike-slip faults might\n\nbe segmented, like the San Andreas Fault in  California (e.g., Bennett\n\net al., 2004). Consequently, the segment of the SWIM fault covered\n\nby the network might be either inactive, creeping or being lock,\n\nwhile farther west, where a number of earthquakes cluster in the\n\nvicinity of the fault, earthquakes may  indicate fault activity.\n\nThe idea of active subduction in  the Gulf of Cadiz is still under\n\ndebate. Plate tectonic reconstructions of the Western Mediter-\n\nranean suggests that the Oligocene/Miocene evolution was  driven\n\nby subduction and slab roll-back (e.g., Faccenna et al., 2001). A\n\nremaining slab of eastward subduction has been imaged under\n\nthe western Alboran Sea (e.g., Garcia-Castellanos and Villasen?or,\n\n2011; Bezada et al., 2013) and geochemical studies of  magmatic\n\nrocks from the Alboran Sea suggest that subduction related vol-\n\ncanism occurred until Miocene times (Duggen et al., 2003, 2004).\n\nThe existence of a Miocene magmatic arc in the Alboran Sea has\n\nbeen supported by seismic reflection imaging (Booth-Rea et al.,\n\n2007). However, arc magmatism in the Alboran Sea stopped in  the\n\nMiocene (Duggen et al., 2003, 2004) and the stratigraphic analysis\n\nof seismic data from the Gulf of Cadiz may  support the interpreta-\n\ntion that accretion has stopped several million years ago (Iribarren\n\net al., 2007). This conclusion is sustained by simulating the tectonic\n\nreconstruction of the western Mediterranean using 3-D numeri-\n\ncal modelling, indicating that  subduction roll-back is stalled since\n\nTortonian (?8 Ma)  (Chertova et al., 2014). In terms of these results\n\nit seems reasonable to  suggest that subduction has largely ceased\n\nand hence the former megathrust might be seismically inactive.\n\nHowever, a  lack of seismicity itself cannot be used to  argue that\n\nsubduction ceased. For example, a number of subduction megath-\n\ndx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jog.2016.06.001\n\n\nPlease cite this article in press as: Grevemeyer, I.,  et al., Mantle earthquakes beneath the South Iberia continental margin and Gulf of\n\nCadiz \u2013 constraints from an onshore-offshore seismological network.

Tsunami deposit found\n\nin the trench of Cascadia and even thousands of kilometres away\n\nin Japan suggest that Cascadia suffers from a major magnitude\n\nM ? 9 earthquake every 300\u2013800 years (Satake et al., 1996, 2003).\n\nThus, depending on convergence rate, such settings may  support\n\ncatastrophic earthquakes with large recurrence intervals of several\n\nhundreds to thousands of years. Consequently, the observed qui-\n\nescence to the south of 36?N cannot be used to rule out a  future\n\nmegathrust earthquake.\n\nZitellini et al. (2009) presented the SWIM faults as being a devel-\n\noping plate boundary. The fact that the plate boundary is  yet not\n\nfully developed has been indicated by  current stress indicators, like\n\nGPS  velocities and earthquake rates (Cunha et al., 2012). However,\n\nan alternative interpretation might be that the SWIM faults com-\n\nprise several smaller fault segments rather than acting like  a  single\n\n600 km long faults zone. The fact that some segments of the SWIM\n\nfaults are actively slipping is  supported by  seismic reflection imag-\n\ning (Bartolome et al., 2012)  and probably by a number of not  so\n\nwell located earthquakes to  the west of the network. In addition,\n\nGeissler et al. (2010) reported a  single strike-slip mechanism in  the\n\nvicinity of the SWIM1  fault. Thus, the observed seismicity pattern\n\nand the lack of seismicity along major parts of the fault could also\n\nbe interpreted as being related to a  segmented fault and the seismic\n\ncycle. Today, we know that  earthquakes are the result of a  stick\u2013slip\n\nfrictional instability (Brace and Byerlee, 1966),  where \u201cthe earth-\n\nquake is the \u2018slip\u2019 and the \u2018stick\u2019 is the interseismic period of elastic\n\nstrain accumulation\u201d (Scholtz, 1998). Within the cycle, the inter-\n\nseismic stain accumulation might be aseismic. Such features were\n\nobserved along the most prominent fault in the Gulf of Almeria \u2013 the\n\n100 km long northeast-southwest trending left-lateral strike-slip\n\nCarboneras Fault (Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2006). The fault remained seismi-\n\ncally inactive during a  5 months long seismic monitoring campaign\n\n(Grevemeyer et al., 2015). However, the Carboneras Fault is asso-\n\nciated with a number of historic earthquakes, affecting the city\n\nof Almeria in southern Spain. Furthermore, geomorphic features\n\nfound along the strike-slip fault clearly indicated active motion\n\n(Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2006). In terms of the evidence found at the Carbon-\n\neras Fault, we suggest that the SWIM faults mimic  the Carboneras\n\nFault. Thus, they might be either creeping or accumulating strain\n\nbeing released in future seismic activity.\n\n5.5. A passive-aggressive margin or an active plate boundary?\n\nThe features discussed above clearly indicate that seismicity\n\nalong the southern Iberia margin resembles activity found along\n\nthe passive continental margins of the eastern US (Zoback, 1992;\n\nWolin et al., 2012) and Brazil (Assumpcao et al., 2011); the main\n\ndifferences being that earthquakes tend to occur at crustal levels\n\nalong the American passive margins, while most events in the Gulf\n\nof Cadiz rupture at mantle depth. Moreover, the rate of seismicity\n\noff Iberia is much higher.\n\nAn active plate boundary or STEP fault (Govers and Wortel,\n\n2005) running from the Betics into the Gulf of Cadiz would favour a\n\nrather continuous band of seismicity. However, it is observed that\n\nseismicity and deformation is spread over a  wider area rather than\n\nrepresenting a discrete fault (e.g., Sartori et al., 1994; Hayward\n\net al., 1999),  supporting a rather diffusive plate boundary. Alter-\n\nnatively, Terrinha et al. (2009) advocated a regional (large scale)\n\nstrain partitioning scenario, suggesting that the WNW-ESE conver-\n\ngence between both plates is  simultaneously accommodated by (i)\n\nright-lateral strike-slip movement (along the SWIM fault system)\n\nand (ii) thrusting along NNE-SSW to  N-S directed faults. Either, a\n\nrather diffusive plate boundary or strain partitioning may  explain\n\nthe much higher rate of seismicity off Iberia when compared to\n\nother passive margins. Besides, passive margins are generally sev-\n\neral thousands of kilometres from any plate boundary and hence in\n\nthe plate interior. In  contrast, the south Iberian margin is situated\n\nabout 100\u2013200 km off Africa. Thus, normal passive margins suffer\n\nfrom far field stresses, while southern Iberia suffers from regional\n\nstresses caused by collision.\n\nThe fact that mantle earthquakes dominate in the Gulf of Cadiz\n\nmight be caused by deformation associated with a rather unique\n\nsetting. First, the Triassic to  Jurassic age of the margin makes Iberia\n\none of the oldest passive margins. Second, collision is  generally not\n\nassociated with active subduction. Third, in  the center of  the Gulf\n\nof Cadiz a  fragment of Jurassic oceanic lithosphere (Fig. 1; Sallares\n\net al., 2011; Martinez-Loriente et al., 2014)  is sandwiched between\n\nAfrican and Eurasian continental lithosphere. Thus, convergence\n\nbetween both continents will push thick Jurassic oceanic litho-\n\nsphere against Triassic continental lithosphere. Shortening and\n\ndeformation of such old and hence rigid lithosphere may  cause\n\nintense deformation at mantle depth, explaining the large number\n\nof mantle earthquakes.\n\nIf the margin parallel seismicity would be related to  an active\n\nSTEP fault (Govers and Wortel, 2005) and westward slab retreat\n\n(e.g. Gutscher, 2004; Gutscher et al., 2012), we would expect a\n\nrather continuous band of seismicity outlining a major active fault.\n\nHowever, neither the Portuguese nor the Spanish national cata-\n\nlogues indicate such features, but show two  unrelated clusters\n\nof activity at the Algarve margin and in the Betics (Fig. 8). An\n\ninactive STEP fault would be supported by stalled subduction and\n\nslab retreat (Chertova et al., 2014). Off the Algarve coast to the\n\nwest of 7?W, earthquakes are co-located with a  prominent grav-\n\nity anomaly, supporting that seismicity is related to pre-existing\n\nfeatures of the passive margin that are re-activated by the con-\n\nvergence between Africa and Eurasia (Zitellini et al., 2004). A  new\n\nplate boundary fault may  develop further south (Zitellini et al.,\n\n2009)  along the SWIM faults. We  therefore suggest classifying the\n\nmargin of southern Iberia as a rather active and hence seismically\n\naggressive-passive margin.\n\n6. Conclusions\n\nAn  amphibious micro-seismicity survey was conducted in the\n\nnorthern Gulf of Cadiz and Algarve passive margin, indicating that\n\nthe majority of earthquakes was either located in the lower crust\n\nor the upper mantle. Roughly 50% of the detected events occurred\n\neither in  the oceanic mantle of Jurassic lithosphere or beneath the\n\ncontinent-ocean transition zone and continental crust of the south\n\nAlgarve-Iberia margin.\n\n(i) Seismicity pattern supports a  strong lower crust and upper\n\ncontinental mantle.\n\n(ii) We consider the margin as a  rather active or \u201caggressive\u201d pas-\n\nsive margin where pre-existing faults are re-activated by the\n\nAfrican/Eurasian plate convergence. This conclusion is  sup-\n\nported by the fact that seismicity found along the Algarve\n\nmargin mimics the fault pattern along the passive margin of\n\nthe Eastern US (Zoback, 1992; Wolin et al., 2012) and Eastern\n\nBrazil (Assumpcao et al., 2011).\n\n(iii) Little evidence was  found that the SWIM faults, as lithospheric\n\nscale W-E  trending strike-slip faults, were seismically active\n\nduring the offshore deployment.\n\n(iv) We did not observe any earthquakes supporting an active east-\n\nward dipping subduction zone.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis study is part of the TOPO-EUROPE initiative of  the EURO-\n\nCORES Programme of the European Science Foundation (ESF).

Seismic data suggest that fluid flow is mediated by a \n\n>400-km-long strike-slip fault marking the transcurrent plate boundary between Africa and \n\nEurasia. Geochemical data (Cl, B, Sr, 87Sr/86Sr, ?18O, ?D) reveal that fluids originate in oceanic \n\ncrust older than 140 Ma. On their rise to the surface, these fluids receive strong geochemical \n\nsignals from recrystallization of Upper Jurassic carbonates and clay-mineral dehydration in \n\nyounger terrigeneous units. At present, reports of mud volcanoes in similar deep-sea settings \n\nare rare, but given that the large area of transform-type plate boundaries has been barely \n\ninvestigated, such pathways of fluid discharge may provide an important, yet unappreciated \n\nlink between the deeply buried oceanic crust and the deep ocean.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nFluid seepage and mud volcanism are common \n\nat active and passive continental margins (Kopf, \n\n2002); typical driving mechanisms are (1) rapid \n\nsedimentation in combination with compaction \n\nand tectonic stress, (2) intrusive processes like \n\nsalt diapirism, (3) dewatering of hydrous min-\n\nerals, and (4) formation of hydrocarbons. These \n\nfactors are met in the Gulf of Cadiz, where sev-\n\neral kilometer-thick Mesozoic to Holocene sedi-\n\nments accumulated in an accretionary wedge, \n\nhosting numerous mud volcanoes (MVs) prefer-\n\nentially at fault intersections (Fig. 1; Magalh\u00e3es \n\net al., 2012). Proximal to the coast, MV fluids \n\nare strongly influenced by clay-mineral dehy-\n\ndration and leaching of Upper Triassic evapo-\n\nrites (Haffert et al., 2013). With increasing dis-\n\ntance from the coast, the fluid signature changes, \n\nand fluid interaction with the underlying oceanic \n\ncrust was postulated based on results from the \n\nPorto MV (Scholz et al., 2009). The occurrence \n\nof MVs located at water depths >2500 m is \n\nclosely tied to the presence of active strike-slip \n\nfaults (Duarte et al., 2013; Fig. 1), which pro-\n\nvide deeply rooted fluid pathways (Hensen et \n\nal., 2007). In 2012, R/V Meteor cruise M86/5 \n\nwas conducted to test hypothesized fluid seep-\n\nage along deep-rooted strike-slip faults also in \n\ndistal segments outside the accretionary wedge. \n\nOur findings call for a reappraisal of oceanic \n\ntransform-type faults as fluid conduits and sup-\n\nport current hypotheses about ongoing fluid cir-\n\nculation in \u201caged\u201d upper oceanic crust.\n\nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS\n\nAcoustic backscatter anomalies recorded \n\nduring previous bathymetric surveys led to the \n\ndiscovery of three new MVs on cruise M86/5: \n\nAbzu, Tiamat, and Michael Ivanov (ATI MVs \n\nhereafter; Fig. 1A) at water depths of ~4500 m \n\nat the southern rim of the Horseshoe Valley, ~90 \n\nkm west of the deformation front of the accre-\n\ntionary wedge (Fig. 1A; Duarte et al., 2013). \n\nThese MVs are smaller than those found on \n\nthe accretionary wedge and consist of isolated \n\ncones (Fig. 1B) aligned on the Lineament South \n\n(LS) trend (Bartolome et al., 2012; Terrinha et \n\nal., 2009). The position of the MVs along the \n\nLS fault coincides with a seismically active zone \n\nwith earthquakes of magnitudes M\nw\n ?6 nucle-\n\nating in the upper mantle between 40 km and \n\n60 km depth (Fig. 1A; Geissler et al., 2010). \n\nThis suggests a fault intersection scenario simi-\n\nlar to the situation on the accretionary wedge. \n\nFive gravity cores of up to 4.75 m length were \n\nobtained from active fluid emanation sites at ATI \n\nand Porto MVs (see Appendix DR1 in the GSA \n\nData Repository1). Pore water was extracted in \n\nintervals ?25 cm and analyzed for major and \n\nminor element composition using standard ana-\n\n1 GSA Data Repository item 2015124, supporting \ninformation on locations, fluid geochemical data, \nanalytical methods, Sr-isotope data of mud clasts, \nand heat flow measurements, is available online at \nwww.geosociety.org/pubs/ft2015.htm, or on request \nfrom editing@geosociety.org or Documents Secre-\ntary, GSA, P.O.

MV sediments typically consist of \n\nolive-gray mud breccias with claystone clasts \n\nof millimeter to centimeter size, and are highly \n\nenriched in H\n2\nS and methane. Gas hydrates are \n\nfound below the zone of anaerobic oxidation \n\nof methane (AOM). Dissolved methane escap-\n\ning from the MV sediment forms plumes above \n\nthe seafloor and feeds chemosymbiotic assem-\n\nblages including several species of bivalves and \n\ntubeworms (Cunha et al., 2013).\n\nFLUID SOURCES AND IMPLICATIONS\n\nAt ATI MVs, a shallow AOM zone prevails \n\n(40\u2013200 cm sediment depth) due to advection \n\nof methane-rich fluids. Below the AOM zone, \n\nmixing with ambient bottom water is minor so \n\nthat the chemical composition of rising deep flu-\n\nids can be studied on samples from this depth, \n\ndefined as \u201clocal endmembers\u201d of a core (e.g., \n\nScholz et al., 2009). Local endmembers from \n\nfour cores sampled on cruise M86/5 at ATI MVs \n\nand one core from Porto MV were selected and \n\ncompared to previously published (Hensen et \n\nal., 2007; Scholz et al., 2009) local endmembers \n\nfrom MVs on the accretionary wedge (Fig. 2; \n\nAppendix DR1; distal MVs: Carlos Ribeiro \n\n[CRMV], Bonjardim, Porto; proximal MVs: \n\nMercator, Captain Arutyunov [CAMV]).\n\nFluid data reveal positive and negative corre-\n\nlations of ?18O and Cl versus B (Fig. 2A) and \n\n?18O versus ?D (Fig. 2B), respectively. Such \n\ntrends are typical for clay-mineral dehydra-\n\ntion, a major fluid source in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n(Hensen et al., 2007). Clay dehydration causes \n\nfreshening of fluids (depletion of conservative \n\nelements such as Cl), a characteristic signal \n\nof ?18O above and ?D below standard seawa-\n\nter composition (Vienna standard mean ocean \n\nwater, VSMOW), as well as enrichments of \n\nboron and other fluid-mobile elements (D\u00e4hl-\n\nmann and de Lange, 2003).\n\nSimilarly, MV endmembers of Sr (Fig. 2C) \n\nand 87Sr/86Sr ratios (Fig. 2D) were plotted versus \n\nCl. Data from non-ATI MVs in Figure 2C show \n\na similar relationship as in Figures 2A and 2B, \n\nGEOLOGY, April 2015; v. 43; no. 4; p. 1\u20134; Data Repository item 2015124 | doi:10.1130/G36359.1 | Published online XX Month 2015\n\u00a9 2015 Geological Society of America.

This suggests that \n\nSr is also derived from clay dehydration. By \n\ncontrast, ATI MV fluids are clearly offset from \n\nthis trend. Explaining this offset by mixing of \n\nclay-mineral\u2013derived water and seawater would \n\nrequire an unrealistically strong Sr source in \n\nclays. Moreover, Sr released from clays has a \n\nhigh (radiogenic) 87Sr/86Sr ratio (Scholz et al., \n\n2009; Appendix DR3) so that a strong Sr input \n\nfrom clays at ATI MVs should cause a positive \n\noffset in the isotopic signature, which is not the \n\ncase (Fig. 2D). Instead, the 87Sr/86Sr signal of \n\nfluids at all distal MVs indicate the decreasing \n\ninfluence of clay-mineral dewatering (Scholz \n\net al., 2009) suggesting a low (less radiogenic) \n87Sr/86Sr ratio of the source at ATI MVs. Two \n\npossible sources of Sr can induce such a low \n87Sr/86Sr signal in this geological setting: deeply \n\nburied oceanic crust, and recrystallization of \n\nMesozoic carbonates. Sr concentrations in \n\nhydrothermal vent fluids vary between 80 \u00b5M \n\nand 300 \u00b5M (Butterfield et al., 1994; Camp-\n\nbell et al., 1988; Mottl et al., 2000; Von Damm, \n\n1990), which is below the level measured in \n\nmost of the MV fluids. Therefore, oceanic crust \n\nis unlikely to be the dominant source of Sr at the \n\nATI MVs. Pore waters of (pelagic) limestones \n\ncan be enriched in Sr by >1 mM. The Sr enrich-\n\nment is related to recrystallization (Gieskes and \n\nLawrence, 1981) of Sr-rich, meta-stable arago-\n\nnite to Sr-poor, stable calcite. The 87Sr/86Sr ratio \n\nof fluids affected by this process may be as low \n\nas 0.7068 (87Sr/86Sr of Upper Jurassic seawater \n\nand carbonates; Banner, 2004). Seismostratig-\n\nraphy calibrated with results of nearby Deep \n\nSea Drilling Project (DSDP) Site 135 (Fig. 1) \n\nshows an exceptionally thick (2.5 km) sequence \n\nof Upper Jurassic sediments on top of the oce-\n\nanic basement below the ATI MVs (Fig. 1C; \n\nMart\u00ednez-Loriente et al., 2013). Evidence from \n\nDSDP Site 105 (Hollister et al., 1972), the west-\n\nern Atlantic counterpart to Site 135, suggests \n\nthat Upper Jurassic sediments in the study area \n\nare indeed pelagic limestones.\n\nTo further explore how potential sources \n\nmay affect the MV fluid compositions, we \n\nexamine a plot of Sr/B versus 87Sr/86Sr (Fig. 3). \n\nThis combination of parameters allows for a \n\nclear discrimination between (1) clay (strongly \n\nradiogenic 87Sr/86Sr), (2) carbonates (87Sr/86Sr \n\nbetween present-day and the Late Jurassic \n\nOcean; high Sr/B), and (3) oceanic crust (well-\n\ndefined, strongly non-radiogenic 87Sr/86Sr) as \n\npotential sources. The fluid composition of the \n\nproximal MVs is close to the suggested end-\n\nmember of clay-mineral dewatering, while that \n\nof ATI MVs shows a strong imprint of recrystal-\n\nlization of Upper Jurassic carbonates (Fig. 3). \n\nThe distal, non-ATI MVs plot within the binary \n\nmixing field of \u201cclay\u201d and \u201ccrust\u201d, suggesting \n\na negligible influence of carbonate recrystalli-\n\nzation there. This interpretation is in line with \n\nstratigraphic evidence for the subsurface exten-\n\nsion of Upper Jurassic sediments (Fig. 4). Con-\n\nsequently, only ATI MVs receive the strong sig-\n\nnal from carbonate recrystallization.\n\nUnlike clay minerals, sedimentary carbonates \n\ndo not store water in their lattice, and the pro-\n\ncess of recrystallization only enriches ambient \n\npore waters in Sr. Therefore, an additional trans-\n\nport mechanism is required to carry the signal \n\nof carbonate recrystallization to the seafloor. \n\nFreshwater release from clay is presumably \n\nlow in carbonate-rich sediments. In addition, \n\nclay-mineral dehydration occurs at tempera-\n\ntures between 60 \u00b0C and 150 \u00b0C (Hensen et \n\nal., 2007), which translates into sub-seafloor \n\ndepths of ~1\u20133 km (geothermal gradient 45\u201350 \n\nK km\u20131; Appendix DR4; Grevemeyer et al., \n\n2009). Thus, there is only a limited overlap \n\nwith the Upper Jurassic sediments (2\u20134.5 km \n\nsub-seafloor depth). As the Upper Jurassic unit \n\ncorresponds to the deepest sedimentary depos-\n\nits located right above the oceanic crust, only \n\na scenario where crustal-derived fluids carry \n\nthe geochemical signals upward (mixing of all \n\nthree sources in Fig. 3) can explain observed \n\n7\u00b0W8\u00b0W9\u00b0W10\u00b0W11\u00b0W\n\n37\u00b0N\n\n36\u00b0N\n\n35\u00b0N\n\n-1000\n\n-2000\n\n-3000\n\n-4000\n\n-5000\n\n0\nmeters\n\n0 50 100Km\n\nDSDP 135\n\nIBERIA\n\nCoral Patch\nRidge\n\nAccre?onary wedge\n\nSeine\n\nAbyssal Plain\n\nHorseshoe\nAbyssal Plain\n\nGo\nrr\n\nin\nge\n\nBa\nnk S\n\n.

Such a scenario is in com-\n\npliance with the evidence for crustal alteration \n\nin MV fluids in the Gulf of Cadiz (Scholz et \n\nal., 2009). Our observations are summarized \n\nin a synthetic cross section (Fig. 4). Overall, \n\nfluids at Porto MV carry the strongest signal \n\nfrom oceanic crust alteration (Fig. 3), which is \n\nin agreement with the thinnest sediment cover \n\nat this site (Fig. 4). Compared to all other sites, \n\nthere is also an obvious negative offset in ?18O \n\nvalues at this location. Negative shifts in ?18O, \n\ni.e., opposite to the effect observed during clay \n\ndehydration, are typical for mineral hydration \n\nprocesses such as the alteration of volcanic ash \n\nor oceanic crust (Gieskes and Lawrence, 1981). \n\nThis trend is hardly visible at ATI MVs, likely \n\ndue to the strong imprint of carbonate recrystal-\n\nlization favoring the formation of 18O-enriched \n\nfluids at elevated temperatures (Lawrence et al., \n\n1975) and counteracting any negative crustal-\n\nderived ?18O signal.\n\nIn spite of the clear geochemical evidence, the \n\nprecise mechanism driving fluid flow remains \n\nelusive. The major strike-slip fault (LS) pro-\n\nvides a deep-reaching, permeable conduit that \n\nserves as pathway for ascending fluids. Strike-\n\nslip faulting has been previously suggested as a \n\nmechanism for the release of overpressure, even-\n\ntually leading to pulses of fluid flow (Mazzini et \n\nal., 2009; Sibson, 1987; Viola et al., 2005). Deep \n\nseismic activity in the vicinity of ATI MVs (Fig. \n\n1) indeed supports this hypothesis. In addition, \n\npore water convection, related to the existence of \n\nlocal basement highs (e.g., Coral Patch Ridge; \n\nFigs. 1 and 4), could provide an alternative sce-\n\nnario of crustal-derived flow. To date, examples \n\nfor fluid convection are mainly reported from \n\nthe eastern Pacific, where pore fluids circulate \n\nthrough interconnected seamounts in young \n\noceanic crust (Fisher et al., 2003).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nOur findings confirm that seismogenic strike-\n\nslip faults provide pathways for deep-seated flu-\n\nids, sustaining mud volcanism even in abyssal \n\nregions, outside areas of rapid sediment accu-\n\nmulation. Moreover, strike-slip faults tap fluid \n\nsources in oceanic crust older than 140 Ma, \n\ncontradicting previous assumptions that fluid \n\ncirculation terminates at a crustal age of ca. 65 \n\n\u00b1 10 Ma (Stein et al., 1995). Although the exact \n\nmechanism remains poorly constrained, our data \n\nprovide evidence for fluid flow within old oce-\n\nanic crust in an area of strong topographic con-\n\ntrasts and deep basement faults as suggested by \n\nVon Herzen (2004).

Moreover, a\n\nrecognized depth discrepancy, between the (upper crust) interference fault-pattern and the (lithospheric\n\nmantle) seismicity, is interpreted as a manifestation of similar thrust\u2013wrench tectonic interference at differ-\n\nent lithospheric depths. Accordingly, an intermediate lower crust\u2013upper mantle aseismic (i.e. softened)\n\ndepth-domain could be explained by pervasive alteration/serpentinization, prompted by fluid percolation\n\nthrough fault-related fractures associated with the newly revealed corner zone fault-network. Overall\n\nobtained results reinforce the relevance of a thrust\u2013wrench multi-rupture seismic scenario as the main\n\ncause for the moderate seismicity (Mwb6.0) in the study area.\n\n\u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction\n\nThe Gulf of Cadiz (Fig. 1A) has long been considered a key domain\nto unravel the complex tectonics of the Eurasia\u2013Africa plate boundary\n(e.g. Duarte et al., 2011; Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003a,b; Gutscher et al., 2002,\n2009a,b; Rosas et al., 2009; Sallar\u00e8s et al., 2011; Sartori et al., 1994;\nTerrinha et al., 2003, 2009; Tortella et al., 1997; Zitellini et al., 2001,\n2004, 2009). It corresponds to a specific segment of this boundary\ncharacterized by the interplay between the Iberia and Nubia subplates,\nconnecting the (Atlantic) transform Gloria Fault, to the West, with the\ndextral transpressive Rif\u2013Tell shear zone (Morel and Meghraoui, 1996)\nto the East of Straits of Gibraltar, and across the Betic\u2013Rif orogenic arc.\n\nIn the Gulf of Cadiz domain, the Iberia\u2013Nubia plate boundary has been\nconsidered of a diffuse nature (e.g. Medialdea et al., 2004; Sartori et\nal., 1994). Accordingly, present day WNW\u2013ESE convergence between\nboth plates at a ~4\u20135 mm/yr rate, (e.g. Fernandes et al., 2007; Nocquet\nand Calais, 2004; Serpelloni et al., 2007; Stich et al., 2006, gray line in\nthe inset of Fig. 1B) is here accommodated by a considerable number\nof widespread and differently orientated active tectonic structures,\nmostly consisting of strike\u2013slip and thrust faults (Fig. 1B). During the\nlast decade, the acquisition and interpretation of geophysical data (e.g.\nreflection/refraction seismics and multi-beam swath bathymetry) led\nto the progressive discovery of several new morphotectonic features,\nresulting in the continuous improvement of the Gulf of Cadiz tectonic\nmap (see Fig. 1B, Bartolome et al., accepted for publication; Duarte et\nal., 2009, 2010; Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003a,b; Rosas et al., 2009; Terrinha et\nal., 2003, 2009; Zitellini et al., 2004, 2009). Recently, based on a new\nwide-angle refraction seismic (WAS) profile (Fig. 1B), Sallar\u00e8s et al.\n(2011) provided new insight on the nature of the crust across different\nmorphotectonic domains in the central part of the Gulf of Cadiz, and\n\nTectonophysics 548\u2013549 (2012) 1\u201321\n\n?

The recurrence inter-\nval of these great events (Mw>8.0) has been estimated in 1800 years\n\nbased on turbidite paleoseismology approach (Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2010). In\naddition, a network of broadband OBS deployed in the area during a\nyear, confirmed greater depths for low-magnitude local earthquakes\n(40\u201360 km, Geissler et al., 2010), highlighting the relevance of\nseismogenic mantle rheology and deep lithospheric structures, comple-\nmentary to the known (i.e. mapped) shallower crustal faults. The seis-\nmic and tsunami hazard posed by the high-magnitude earthquakes\ncontinue to trigger the interest, and the need, to search for their\nseismogenic sources, and hence to better understand the tectonic evo-\nlution of the region.\n\nFig. 3.

Present work\n\nIn the study area, a new morphotectonic pattern is revealed in the\nzone of intersection (corner zone) between a main regional thrust,\nthe so called Horseshoe Thrust Fault (Horseshoe Fault of Gr\u00e0cia et\nal., 2003b), and a major dextral strike\u2013slip fault, the SWIM 1 Fault\n(Zitellini et al., 2009), crossing each other and making an angle of\n~120\u00b0/60\u00b0 (HTF and SWIM 1in Figs. 1B, 2 and 3). The new corner\nzone tectonic structures, and their correspondent geometry and kine-\nmatics are here interpreted as resulting from regional, active, thrust\u2013\nwrench tectonic interference. Based on the previously established re-\ngional seismostratigraphy, and on newly interpreted seismotectonic\ndata, this assumption is tested through coupled analog, and 3D finite-\nelement numerical modeling. Both modeling approaches assume (brit-\ntle) upper-crust mechanical interference. Obtained results are further\ncompared with the natural example, and ensuing implications for\nthe overall tectonic evolution of the Gulf of Cadiz are discussed.\n\n2. Regional tectonic setting\n\nIn the Gulf of Cadiz tectonic map of Fig. 1B three main sets of\nmajor faults can be recognized: 1) The thrust front that bounds the\nso called Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge (GCAW, in the eastern\nhalf of the study area, Fig. 1B); 2) a set of NE\u2013SW striking thrust-\n\nfaults, preferably located to the west of the Horseshoe Valley (e.g.\nHorseshoe Thrust Fault, Marqu\u00eas de Pombal Fault, Gorringe Fault,\nand Tagus Abyssal Plain Thrust); and 3) a set of WNW\u2013ESE dextral\nstrike\u2013slip faults, corresponding to the SWIM wrench system, as de-\nfined by Zitellini et al. (2009).\n\nThe GCAW was interpreted as an accretionary wedge related with\nthe eastwards dipping (roll back) subduction of an oceanic litho-\nspheric slab beneath the Gibraltar arc (Gutscher, 2004; Gutscher et\nal., 2002). The same authors considered this subduction zone as the\nseismogenic source of the 1755 Great Lisbon Earthquake, although its\npresent day activity is still intensively debated (Duarte et al., 2011;\nGr\u00e0cia et al., 2003a,b; Gutscher, 2004; Gutscher et al., 2002, 2009a,b;\nTerrinha et al., 2003, 2009; Zitellini et al., 2004, 2009).\n\nThe set of NE\u2013SW thrusts includes the studied northwest-directed\nHorseshoe Thrust Fault (see Fig. 1B) that is considered one of the\nmost significant structures in the Gulf of Cadiz, active since at least\nTortonian times (~10 My, e.g. Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003a,b; Terrinha et al.,\n2009; Zitellini et al., 2004). This major thrust was previously pro-\nposed to share a common detachment with other NE\u2013SW thrusts in\nthe area, namely with the Marqu\u00eas de Pombal Fault (MPF), with\nwhich it was also thought to represent an alternative source for the\n1755 Great Lisbon Earthquake (Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003a,b; Terrinha et al.,\n2003, 2009). As a whole, these regional major thrusts (see Fig. 1B)\nwere firstly hypothetically interpreted by Ribeiro et al. (1996) as\n\nFig. 4. (A) Multi-channel seismic profile IAM-4e (see Fig. 3 for location); and (B) correspondent seismostratigraphic and tectonic interpretation (adapted from Duarte et al., 2010).\n\nThin black lines: seismic reflectors interpreted as stratigraphic horizons; Double-dashed black and white lines: intra-chaotic body reflections interpreted as decollement horizons\n\nand folded layered sediments.\n\n5F.M. Rosas et al. / Tectonophysics 548\u2013549 (2012) 1\u201321\n\nimage of Fig.?4\n\n\nearly manifestations of the tectonic reactivation of the southwest Ibe-\nrian margin, representing the onset of subduction initiation along this\nsegment of the Atlantic passive margin. More recently, Terrinha et al.\n(2009) considered these same structures as part of an en-\u00e9chelon\n300 km long N\u2013S trending fault system, extending between latitude\n~35.5\u00b0N and 38\u00b0N. The same authors interpreted this system as the\nexpression of a diachronic westwards and northwards migration of\nthe deformation in the Gulf of Cadiz, from Late Miocene times to Pre-\nsent day. Accordingly, during this period of time active deformation\nwould have propagated from the GCAW thrust front to the west\n(e.g. HTF and Gorringe Fault), and further to the north along the SW\nIberian margin (e.g. MPF and Tagus Abyssal Plain Thrust). These same\nauthors also argue for the present day existence of large scale strain par-\ntitioning in the Gulf of Cadiz, comprising not only the activity of the NE\u2013\nSW thrust system, but also active dextral wrenching ascribed to the\nWNW\u2013ESE SWIM system.\n\nAccording to Zitellini et al. (2009) the SWIM system corresponds\nto a broad deformation band extending across the entire Gulf of Cadiz\ndomain (along 600 km), essentially characterized by sets of major\ndeep rooted, sub-vertical, dextral strike\u2013slip faults (Bartolome et al.,\n2012). These SWIM faults (see Fig. 1B), which are thought to be active\nsince at least ~1.8 My (Rosas et al., 2009), strike subparallel to the pre-\nsent day convergence direction between Nubia and Iberia (WNW\u2013ESE,\nsee gray line in the inset of Fig. 1B), and were interpreted as the precur-\nsor of a new (dextral) transcurrent plate boundary in the Gulf of Cadiz\n(Zitellini et al., 2009). Alternatively, Duarte et al. (2011) showed that\n\nthe SWIM faults are more likely to correspond to the reactivation of\nthe ancient Tethyan plate boundary.\n\nIn the study area the SWIM 1 Fault intersects the Horseshoe Thrust\nFault (see Fig. 1B). Hence, some kind of tectonic interference between\nthese two major active faults is expected to occur as a consequence.\n\n2.1. Morphotectonic characterization of the study fault-systems\n\nThe area studied in detail in the present work is limited by the\ndash-lined rectangle in Fig. 1B, whose bathymetry and tectonic inter-\npretation is depicted in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. The newly pro-\nposed tectonic map of Fig. 3B corresponds mostly to the area of\nintersection between the Horseshoe Thrust and the SWIM 1 faults.\nThis area was investigated through the detailed combined analysis\nof the available multibeam swath bathymetry (SWIM compilation,\nZitellini et al., 2009), and numerous multi-channel seismic (MCS) re-\nflection profiles. Sub-seafloor seismic interpretation has been essen-\ntially based on the SWIM-2006 high-resolution MCS cruise carried\nout on board the Spanish RV Hesperides (e.g. Bartolome et al., 2012;\nGr\u00e0cia et al., 2006; Martinez-Loriente et al., 2008) complemented\nwith deeper penetration MCS profiles acquired during the IAM \u2014 Ibe-\nrian Atlantic Margin, (e.g. Banda et al., 1995; Tortella et al., 1997) and\nARRIFANO \u2014 Arco Rifano cruise (e.g. Sartori et al., 1994). A detailed\nmorphological characterization of the NW Gulf of Cadiz domain,\nand its several different sub-domains, was recently presented by\nTerrinha et al. (2009). Consistently with their proposal, the main\n\nFig. 5.

Rosas et al. / Tectonophysics 548\u2013549 (2012) 1\u201321\n\nimage of Fig.?5\n\n\nlarge-scale bathymetric features in the study area are here inter-\npreted as being tectonically controlled by the activity of the recog-\nnized major fault-systems (described below, see Figs. 2 and 3).\n\nBased on the available seismic reflection dataset, a general sei-\nsmostratigraphy was also previously established (e.g. Duarte et al.,\n2010; Sartori et al., 1994; Terrinha et al., 2009; Torelli et al., 1997;\nTortella et al., 1997) comprising (Figs. 4 and 5): a) A basal Mesozoic\n(Jurassic\u2013Cretaceous) unit (~2 s TWTT, two way travel time)\ncorresponding to carbonate sediments; b) A Late Miocene gravitational\n\u201cchaotic body\u201d unit (~1.5 s TWTT) with a semi-chaotic seismic signa-\nture, previously interpreted as an olistostrome body or as a tectonic\n\nm\u00e9lange (Iribarren et al., 2007; Terrinha et al., 2009; Torelli et al.,\n1997; Tortella et al., 1997); c) A top Late Miocene to Plio-Quaternary\nunit (?0.5 s TWTT), corresponding to a sequence of hemipelagic/\nturbidite sedimentary cover (Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2010)..\n\n2.1.1. The Horseshoe Thrust Fault\n\nThe NE\u2013SW trending Horseshoe Thrust Fault scarp is clearly ob-\nserved in the bathymetry (Fig. 2A and B), displaying a maximum height\nof ca. 1000 m in its north-easternmost segment, gradually vanishing\ntowards the SW (Figs. 2 and 3). The SE part of the study area (mostly\ncoinciding with the Horseshoe Valley at depths between 4200 m and\n4800 m, see Fig. 2) is interpreted to correspond to the hanging wall of\nthe NW directed HTF (e.g. Terrinha et al., 2009; Tortella et al., 1997;\nZitellini et al., 2004), thus tectonically uplifted relatively to its footwall,\nwhich corresponds to the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain (HAP) in the NW half\nof the study area (at depths of >4800 m). In the IAM4e profile (Fig. 4),\nthe HTF (around shotpoint 1000 in Fig. 4) is clearly imaged as a SE dip-\nping, deep seated fault. It roots well into the Mesozoic unit, prolonging\nupwards across all the other overlying units, and breaching out at the\nseafloor surface, where the resulting prominent deformation is marked\nby an offset of ca. 420 m (~0.6 s TWTT in the IAM4e profile). The NW di-\nrected thrust kinematics is clearly shown by the geometry of the folds\naffecting the Mesozoic reflectors near the fault plane, and by the unam-\nbiguous offset of the surface marking the top of the Mesozoic unit (see\nFig. 4). To the SE of the HTF other relatively minor thrusts affecting the\nbasal Mesozoic unit were previously described (e.g. Duarte et al., 2010;\nTerrinha et al., 2009), although these only affect the base of the overly-\ning Late Miocene chaotic body (see Fig. 4). The same authors also report\nsome degree of tectonic imbrication within the Miocene chaotic body\nfurther to SE, only mildly perturbing the seafloor morphology.\n\nFig. 6.

Rosas et al. / Tectonophysics 548\u2013549 (2012) 1\u201321\n\nimage of Fig.?6\n\n\n2.1.2. The SWIM 1 Fault\n\nThe SWIM system was recently described by Zitellini et al. (2009)\nas corresponding to a set of WNW\u2013ESE trending, vertical right-lateral\nstrike\u2013slip faults, characterized by a hundred-kilometer long linear\nbathymetric expression, ranging from the foot of the Gorringe Bank,\nin the West Gulf of Cadiz, across the HAP, the Horseshoe Valley and\nthe GCAW, reaching its easternmost area near the Straits of Gibraltar\n(see Fig. 1B). The SWIM 1 Fault (Figs. 1\u20133) is crossed both by the IAM4\nand the IAM3 seismic profiles (Fig. 5), where it can be observed to cor-\nrespond to a deep-seated sub-vertical fault. It cuts across all the main\nseismostratigraphic units, occasionally breaching out, and rooting in\nthe lower pre-Mesozoic (?) basement (at >9 km depth, Bartolome et\nal., accepted for publication). Some segments of the fault exhibit an\noverall geometry resembling flower-like structures (Fig. 5B), agreeing\nwith the previously proposed transcurrent kinematics (e.g. Bartolome\net al., accepted for publication; Duarte et al., 2009; Terrinha et al.,\n2009; Viola et al., 2005; Zitellini et al., 2009).\n\n2.1.3. New interpretation of the tectonic corner zone\n\nThe SWIM 1 Fault intersects the Horseshoe thrust near its SW ter-\nmination (Figs. 2 and 3). In the HAP, away from the HTF, the SWIM 1\nlineament is not prominently recorded in the bathymetry. Neverthe-\nless, the continuation of the correspondent basement strike\u2013slip fault\nwas thoroughly mapped farther to the west, up to the foothills of the\nGorringe Bank flanking its south-western termination (see Figs. 1B\nand 3B, Bartolome et al., accepted for publication; Duarte et al.,\n2009; Terrinha et al., 2009). The available seismic dataset in this\nspecific area (see Fig. 3A) leads to a newly interpreted tectonic configu-\nration (see map of Fig. 3B) comprising a new set of faults (CF1 and CF2)\nlocated near the corner zone of intersection between the SWIM 1\nstrike\u2013slip and the Horseshoe thrust. In the IAM4 profile (Fig. 5) it is\npossible to observe that these corner faults correspond to steep (south-\nwards) dipping faults, rooting in the basement underneath the Mesozo-\nic unit and cutting across the overlying ones, including the base of the\nLate Miocene to Plio-Quaternay top unit. In the case of CF1, the seafloor\nsurface is only mildly perturbed (around SP 4840 in IAM4 profile,\nand black arrow in Figs. 2 and 3B), whereas CF2 lacks any kind of bathy-\nmetric expression. In the IAM4 profile a reverse-fault component of\nmovement along both CF1 and CF2 faults is apparent, revealed namely\nby the offset of the upper limit of the Mesozoic unit across these faults\nthat clearly denounces the upward movement of the respective SE\nfault blocks (see Fig. 5). Since the faults are very steep, a pure dip\u2013slip\nthrusting movement is mechanically implausible in this situation. In\ncontrast, oblique\u2013slip faults, characterized by a predominantly dextral\ntranscurrent kinematics and a minor SE-side up thrusting component,\nwould fit the observed structural geometry.\n\nAdding to this structural evidence, the recently proposed reloca-\ntion of low to moderate magnitude earthquakes in the study area\n(Geissler et al., 2010), showed the existence of two clusters of seis-\nmic events near the northern and southern terminations of the HTF\n(Fig. 6, Geissler et al., 2010). The southern cluster coincides with the\nSWIM 1\u2013HTF corner zone area, and exhibits a WNW\u2013ESE general\ntrend parallel to the SWIM 1 Fault. It should be noted that the great\nmajority of these hypocenters are located at relatively high depths, be-\ntween 40 and 55 km (red dots in Fig. 6), with only a few located out of\nthis depth interval (see Fig. 6: focal depthsb20 km \u2014 yellow dots;\n>55 km \u2014 pink dots). This shows that most of these earthquakes are\nprobably located in the lithospheric mantle (Geissler et al., 2010;\nSallar\u00e8s et al., 2011), and thus cannot be directly linked to the faults\nimaged by the MCS profiles at upper crustal levels (maximum depths\nof ca. 6 km; see discussion below in Section 5). Nevertheless, the\ncorresponding focal mechanism solutions reported in this corner zone\ndomain show significant heterogeneity, possibly due to variable fault\norientation, but generally accounting for dominant reverse and strike\u2013\nslip faulting (Geissler et al., 2010).\n\nThese tectonic and seismic corner-zone manifestations are here\nsuggested to have formed as the result of a particular type of thrust\u2013\nwrench tectonic interference between the Horseshoe and the SWIM\nsystems at different depths. This interference is here investigated and\ntested at upper crustal level through the analog and numerical model-\ning experiments presented below.\n\n3. Analog modeling\n\nAnalog modeling experiments of separated wrench systems (e.g.\nDooley and McClay, 1997; Le Guerroue and Cobbold, 2006; Mandl et\nal., 1977; McClay and Bonora, 2001; Richard et al., 1991; Schopfer and\nSteyrer, 2001) and thrust systems (e.g. Agarwal and Agrawal, 2002;\nBonnet et al., 2007; Ellis et al., 2004; Gutscher et al., 1998a,b;\nLallemand et al., 1994; Lohrmann et al., 2003; Malavieille, 1984, 2010;\nMcClay et al., 2004; Mulugeta, 1988; Zhou et al., 2007) are common\nand well documented. Conversely, physical modeling dealing with the\ndeformation caused by simultaneous thrusting and wrenching is less\ncommon, and generally focused on a variety of different specific aspects\n(e.g. Di Bucci et al., 2006, 2007; Diraison et al., 2000; Viola et al., 2004).\nHence the present work, in which sand-box analog models were pro-\nduced to better understand the deformation patterns resulting from\nthrust\u2013wrench fault interference under the specific conditions of the\nstudy area.\n\n3.1. Experimental method\n\n3.1.1. Material properties and scaling\n\nExperiments were done using dry quartz sand whose properties\nare summarized in Table 1. Sand is considered a Coulomb material\ndeforming in a brittle way according to the Coulomb fracture criterion\n(e.g. Davis et al., 1983; Hubbert, 1937, 1951, Appendix A), and it has\nbeen extensively used in scaled model experiments simulating brittle\ndeformation in the upper crust or other lithospheric competent levels.\nAssuming a brittle behavior for the modeled upper crust, the main ma-\nterial properties sustaining the dynamic similarity between this and\nthe sand are the internal friction (?c) and the cohesion (c0). The first is\ndimensionless, and approximately the same in both model and proto-\ntype (see Table 1), whereas the second has dimension of stress and\nmust be scaled accordingly (Hubbert, 1937, and detailed explanation\nin Appendix A). Thus, for negligible inertial accelerations as in the pre-\nsent case, the model/prototype cohesion ratio (?) is ultimately depen-\ndent on the product of correspondent density (?) and length (?) ratios,\nwhich values are shown in Table 1 (see also Appendix A). It should be\nnoted that since density ratio (?) is generally close to 1 (between 0.5\nand 0.7, e.g. Withjack et al., 2007) the strength of the materials\nexpressed by ? is scaled mostly through the length ratio (?). Given\nthe fact that in the present case ?=5\u00d710?6, and since cohesion for\nupper crustal rocks is clearly typically less than 50 MPa, it becomes im-\nmediately evident the utility of model materials with very low cohesion\n(b100 Pa), such as dry quartz sand, as analogs of upper crustal rocks.\nSince brittle deformation is time independent, scaling was achieved\nthrough considering model-prototype ratios for length (?) and mass\n(?) fundamental units alone (see Table 1).\n\n3.1.2. Apparatus, initial stage and procedure\n\nAll the experiments were carried out in the 1000\u00d7600 mm Per-\nspex deformation box depicted in Fig. 7. The box consists of two\nhorizontal 10 mm thick basal plates (plates A and B in Fig. 7) that\nmove relatively to each other along the X direction, simulating a\nright-lateral strike\u2013slip (basement) fault. A thin metal sheet attached\nto the base of a backstop is moved by a stepping motor also along the\nX direction, sliding on top of both basal plates (Fig. 7A). The front of\nthis metal sheet works as a velocity discontinuity (VD) making an\nangle of 60\u00b0/120\u00b0 with the direction of the strike\u2013slip fault (X direc-\ntion). Two fixed lateral vertical walls confine the whole system. In\n\n8 F.M. Rosas et al. / Tectonophysics 548\u2013549 (2012) 1\u201321\n\n\n\nFig. 7. Analog modeling experimental apparatus and setup.

Rosas et al. / Tectonophysics 548\u2013549 (2012) 1\u201321\n\nimage of Fig.?8\n\n\nthe initial stage, a layered sand cake was prepared inside the box on\ntop of the intersection between the basal strike\u2013slip fault and the ve-\nlocity discontinuity (Fig. 7B). This was achieved by pouring batches of\ndifferently colored sand from a moving elongated funnel (with a\nwidth matching the one of the box), guarantying the leveling of its\ntop surface. In most experiments the sand cake thickness was 3 cm\n(corresponding to 6 km in nature), although in several experiments\nthickness of 4 and 5 cm (8 and 10 km) were also used. Layering in\nthe sand cake has no correspondence with any natural structures,\nand was used merely as a 3D strain marker, since at the end-stage of\nall the experiments the deformed sand cake was humidified, and sever-\nal slices were serially cut along different chosen orientations. Likewise,\nparallel (or sometimes square) line grids were also imprinted on the\ntop surface of the model to serve as (2D) passive strain markers.\n\nIn the present modeling the driving kinematics was conceived\nto correspond to the basal right-lateral strike\u2013slip faulting, concurring\nwith the natural example where the dextral SWIM faults are observed\nto strike subparallel to the present day convergence between Iberia\nand Nubia as shown by the reported geodetic data (e.g. Fernandes\net al., 2007; Nocquet and Calais, 2004; Serpelloni et al., 2007; Stich et\nal., 2006, see gray line in the inset of Fig. 1B). It was assumed for all\nthe experiments that when the SWIM fault system was active, a mor-\nphotectonic expression of the Horseshoe Thrust Fault already existed.\nThis complies with the previously reported concept of counterclockwise\nrotation of the convergence direction between Iberia and Nubia\nsubplates, from NW\u2013SE in Late Miocene times, to Present day WNW\u2013\nESE (e.g. Duarte et al., 2011; Terrinha et al., 2009). Such rotation agrees\nwith the notion of the NE\u2013SW thrusting initiation being older than the\nWNW\u2013ESE wrenching tectonic activity (Rosas et al., 2009; Terrinha\net al., 2009; Zitellini et al., 2009). Furthermore, the interpretation of\nseismostratigraphic and tectonic overprint relationships, also shows\nthe HTF to be active since at least Tortonian times (~10 My, e.g. Gr\u00e0cia\net al., 2003a,b; Terrinha et al., 2009; Zitellini et al., 2004), whereas the\nSWIM fault system only since ~1.8 My (Rosas et al., 2009; Terrinha et\nal., 2009). In accordance, all the experiments comprised the following\ntwo successive steps (see Fig. 7A and C):\n\n1) A preliminary step that consisted in moving the backstop (and the\nattached thin metal sheet) along the X direction to the left, only\nuntil a few thrusts were observed to form breaching out at the\ntop surface of the sand cake (Fig. 7C \u2014 step 1). This was done to\nproduce an initial planar week anisotropy representing the origi-\nnal geometry of the HTF system, at an angle of 60/120\u00b0 with the\nbasal (SWIM) strike\u2013slip direction.\n\n2) A second step wherein the basal plates were moved relatively to\neach other (also along X), by pushing the farthest plate (basal\nplate A) to the right (Fig. 7C \u2014 step 2), producing a right-lateral\nmovement along the vertical contact surface between both basal\nplates, simulating the SWIM 1 basement strike\u2013slip fault.\n\nDuring step 2, the central (\u201ccorner zone\u201d) domain of basal plate A was\nlimited by two main kinematically active boundaries: one corresponding\nto the trace of the basal strike\u2013slip fault, and the other to the velocity dis-\ncontinuity (see Fig. 7A and C). Since the dextral strike\u2013slip along the con-\ntact with plate B was accomplished by moving plate A to the right,\nthe boundary between this plate and the over-sliding thin metal sheet\n(velocity discontinuity) corresponded to a convergent limit between\nthe sand above basal plate A, and the sand sitting on top of the thin\nmetal sheet (edged by the velocity discontinuity). Thus, the driving\nforces for deformation in the sand came from the relative movement be-\ntween the sliding basal plates and the thin metal sheet, which were both\nin frictional contact with the overlying sand. As a result, during the sec-\nond experimental step, the sand cake on top of the boundary between\nboth basal plates endured dextral wrenching deformation, whereas\nsimultaneously shortening accommodated by thrusting occurred in the\nsand above the velocity discontinuity. Stepping motors were used to\nmove both the backstop and the basal plates at a constant velocity\n\n(~20 cm/h). The dimensions of the deformation box were sufficiently\nlarge to guarantee that the bulk of the model was not affected by\nboundary effects, and experiments were repeated several times to en-\nsure the consistency of the obtained results. Besides photos of serially\ncut sections of the (end-stage) deformed models, top view photographs\nwere also taken at regular time intervals as the experiments unfolded.\n\n3.2. Experimental results\n\nThe main results are depicted in Figs. 8 and 9. In the experiments\nof Fig. 8A, B and C modeled crustal thickness was of 10, 8 and 6 km,\nrespectively, scaled down to corresponding sand layer thickness of\n5, 4 and 3 cm. This slight variation in the assumed crustal thickness\nwas considered to comply with the inferences from the seismic re-\nflection dataset. However, obtained results show that this did not\nhave any significant influence on the experimentally obtained struc-\ntural pattern (see below). During the first experimental step a pop-\nup structure always formed, bounded by a pair of opposite ~30\u00b0 dip-\nping (fore and back) thrusts, rooting in the velocity discontinuity\n(Fig. 8A1). During the second experimental step, different types of\nstructures were simultaneously formed in the different areas of the\nmodel analyzed below.\n\n3.2.1. Thrust-front and wrenching domains\n\nIn the area in front of the main thrust and relatively away from the\ncorner zone (thrust-front domain depicted in Fig. 8), the incremental\naccumulation of shortening resulting from moving basal plate A to\nthe right could no longer be exclusively accommodated by the origi-\nnal pair of thrusts (forethrust and backthrust) formed during experi-\nmental step1 (Fig. 8A1), and thus new forethrusts were successively\nformed (Fig. 8A2\u2013A3 and B\u2013C). As is classically the case in these type of\nexperiments (e.g. Bonini et al., 2000; Koyi and Maillot, 2007; Lohrmann\net al., 2003; Maillot and Koyi, 2006; Persson and Sokoutis, 2002) each\nnew thrust rooted in the VD and accommodated a certain amount of\nshortening, before being transported along the backthrust fault plane\nwhen a newer forethrust was formed, leading to the end-term situation\ndepicted in Fig. 9B (cross section 6).\n\nSimultaneously, in the sand cake above the basal strike\u2013slip fault\n(wrenching domain as defined in Fig. 8), the first formed structures\nwere en-\u00e9chelon Riedel faults (Riedel, 1929, R-faults in Fig. 8A2) ori-\nentated at low angles to the basement strike\u2013slip direction (15\u00b0 to 20\u00b0\nfor the first increments of deformation). Between these, several P-faults\nalso developed. Offset of parallel lines on model surface by R and P faults\nshowed a synthetic (dextral) strike\u2013slip component of movement along\nthese structures. Further strike\u2013slip increments (Fig. 8A3) originated\nY-faults that formed parallel to the basement fault direction, cut the\nearly R and P-faults, and also exhibited dextral strike\u2013slip kinematics.\nAs shear strain accumulated, the surface area between the R-faults\nrose significantly (compare the topography of Fig. 8A2 and A3) originat-\ning a deformation band parallel to the basement fault with a character-\nistic surface morphology, comprising several sub-parallel elongated\nbulges (see Fig. 8A3). Subsequent strike\u2013slip increments mostly pro-\nduced a continued reduction of the width of the previously formed\ndeformation band, besides the amplification of its relief. In cross sec-\ntions cut perpendicular to the deformation band (Fig. 9 \u2014 cross sections\n1 and 2) the observed overall fault pattern corresponded to an upwards\nsplaying from the basement fault, typically defining a flower structure.\nWithin this, R-faults exhibited some degree of reverse component\nof movement, in line with an oblique (dextral-reverse) kinematics, al-\nthough in the complete absence of any externally induced compression.\nThese structures are typical of wrench fault systems, and confirm previ-\nous standard modeling results (e.g. Dooley and McClay, 1997; Le\nGuerroue and Cobbold, 2006; Mandl et al., 1977; McClay and Bonora,\n2001; Richard et al., 1991; Schopfer and Steyrer, 2001; Viola et al.,\n2004). Specifically, the occurrence of oblique dextral-reverse kinemat-\nics along helicoidal R-faults in the absence of any externally induced\n\n11F.M.

Corner zone\n\nIn the corner zone (as defined in Fig. 8), a lateral propagation of\nthe thrust faults (F2, F3\u2026 Fn) into the wrenching domain was consis-\ntently observed, characterized by a rotation of these faults towards an\n\nFig. 10.

Cross sections 1 and 2: flower-structures orthogonal to the wrenching domain; cross sections 3 to 5: structure along sectioned planes successively closer to the\n\nintersection between the trace of the basal strike\u2013slip and the velocity discontinuity; cross section 6: structure across the thrusting domain. F1, F2 and backthrust (BT) originated\n\nduring experimental step 1 (structures in yellow and orange); F3 to F5, Riedel-faults (R) and Y-faults (Y) originated during experimental step 2 (structures in black). See text for\n\nfurther detailed explanation.\n\n13F.M. Rosas et al. / Tectonophysics 548\u2013549 (2012) 1\u201321\n\nimage of Fig.?10\n\n\norientation sub-parallel to the basal strike \u2013 slip direction (i.e. X axis,\ne.g. F2 in Fig. 8A2 and B; F3 in Fig. 8C). This parallelization occurred\nfrom relatively early strike \u2013 slip increments, and displayed a clock-\nwise rotation of about 60\u00b0 around an inflection point (IP in Fig. 8A2,\nB and C). Offset of parallel strain marker lines along these rotated\nfault segments is consistent with a dextral strike \u2013 slip component\nof movement. In sections cut across the same structures (Fig. 9 \u2014\ncross sections 3\u20135), it was apparent that these also maintained a thrust-\ning component, consistently with general dextral-reverse oblique kine-\nmatics (e.g. F5 in cross sections 3 and 4 of Fig. 9). In some experiments,\nstrain accommodation in the corner zone implied the formation of new\nforethrusts in front of previously rotated fault segments (e.g. F3 and F2\nrespectively in corner zone domain of Fig. 8A3), which as a result ceased\nto propagate and were passively thrusted in the hanging wall of the\nnewer thrust-faults. Subsequently, these newer thrusts were them-\nselves rotated also towards the basal strike\u2013slip fault direction, mimick-\ning the rotation of the previous ones. For further strike\u2013slip increments,\nthe early formed structures in the corner zone were overprinted by\nthe later deformation and became eventually indistinguishable. As a\nresult, only the younger outer (oblique) faults were observed in this do-\nmain (compare F5 outer thrust with F3 and F4 in Fig. 9A). The earlier\n(inner) thrusts tended to become more parallel to the strike\u2013slip direc-\ntion (i.e. they rotated more, e.g. F2 in Fig. 8A2, B and F3 in Fig. 8C) than\nthose formed later, located more externally and generally displaying\na more oblique direction (sub-perpendicular to the one bisecting the\nangle made by basal strike\u2013slip and the velocity discontinuity \u2014 e.g.\nF5 in Fig. 9A). Along successive cross sections cut progressively closer\nto the intersection between the basal strike\u2013slip and the velocity dis-\ncontinuity (Fig. 9A and B \u2014 cross sections 3\u20135), it was possible to ob-\nserve the variation of the interference between wrench-related and\nthrust-related structures.\n\nIn cross section 3 (Fig. 9B), wrench and thrust domains can still be\nseparately identified. In the wrench domain, deformation bands were\nobserved to be bounded, on the left, by a rotated segment of an outer\nthrust (F5, in Fig. 9A and B), and on the right by a Riedel fault. Both\nthese structures showed some degree of dip\u2013slip reverse movement,\ncorresponding to dextral-reverse oblique faults bounding a trans-\npressive pop-up, cut by Y-faults in its middle. The thrust domain along\nthis same direction also corresponded to a (slightly asymmetric) pop-\nup structure, although in this case bounded by faults lacking any kind\nof strike\u2013slip component of movement, formed during the first experi-\nmental step (faults in yellow in cross section 5 of Fig. 9B): on the left two\nforethrusts (F1 and F2), and on the right the original backthrust (BT).\n\nCross section 4 was cut closer to the intersection between the basal\nstrike\u2013slip fault and the velocity discontinuity (Fig. 9B \u2014 cross section\n4). In this cross-section the right-bounding R-fault of the wrench do-\nmain was no longer observed, and instead the two original left-\nbounding faults of the thrust domain (F1 and F2) occurred immediately\nto the right of the Y-faults. It should be noted that to the left of these\n\nY-faults, all the others (F3\u2013F5) also accommodated some amount of\ndextral wrenching, consisting in rotated segments of original thrusts\nexhibiting oblique (dextral-reverse) kinematics. Conversely, to the right\nof the Y-faults, the (F1 and F2) thrusts lacked any kind of wrenching\ncomponent.\n\nCross section 5 was cut through a direction containing the inter-\nsection between the trace of the basal strike\u2013slip fault and the veloc-\nity discontinuity (Fig. 9B \u2014 cross section 5). Along this direction the\nseparation between thrust and wrench domains was no longer\nstraightforward. Instead a single interference domain was observed,\ncomprising both original pure thrusts, formed during the first experi-\nmental step (F1, F2 and BT faults in yellow in Fig. 9B \u2014 cross section 5),\nand dextral strike\u2013slip Y-faults as well as oblique dextral-reverse faults,\nformed during experimental step 2 (Y and F3\u2013F5 faults in black in\nFig. 9B \u2014 cross section 5). F1 and F2 were positioned to the left of\nY-faults along this same cross-section, with the first steepening at\ndepth towards the second, thus defining a tulip-like (positive) flower-\nstructure geometry, consistent with overall (dextral) transpressional\nkinematics.\n\n4. Numerical modeling\n\nTaking into account the same general rheological, geometrical and\nkinematical constraints described above for the SWIM 1\u2013HTF tectonic\nsystem, wrench\u2013thrust mechanical interference was simulated in a\nthree-dimensional plate model using the ABAQUS/Standard software\n(ABAQUS, Inc. 2009). The main goal was to gain some quantitative in-\nsight regarding stress and strain distribution in the thrust\u2013wrench\ncorner zone, which could not be achieved by analog modeling alone.\nIn accordance, the present numerical modeling assumed the same\nbrittle (upper crustal) fault-interference conditions that were consid-\nered for the analog approach. This made it possible to compare both\n(analog and numerical) results, and to assess their degree of compat-\nibility, i.e. to evaluate how well (if at all) the previously obtained\nstructural pattern was matched by the new numerical output, con-\nfirming or dismissing a mechanical corner effect.\n\nAdditionally, the influence of an interbedded shallow soft layer in\nthe mechanics of the interference at stake, as a possible cause of\ndecoupled rheological behavior, was also considered. This was motivat-\ned by the known regional seismostratigraphy that includes the Late\nMiocene gravitational \u201cchaotic body\u201d unit (see Figs. 4 and 5). As referred\nabove, this unit was previously interpreted as resulting from a mixture\nof olistostromes and tectonic m\u00e9langes (Iribarren et al., 2007; Terrinha\net al., 2009; Torelli et al., 1997; Tortella et al., 1997), which could hypo-\nthetically determine a relatively less competent rheological behavior.\n\nSince the studied major faults are only seismically imaged down to\nmaximum depths of ca. 6 to 10 km, the performed numerical model-\ning did not consider their interference at lithospheric scale (accounting\nfor depths of ca. 40\u201350 km). Instead, the main objective was to repro-\nduce the same specific conditions assumed for the analog experiments,\ni.e. to focus on upper crust (brittle) fault-interference. It should be noted\nthat a numerical modeling approach at lithospheric scale would specif-\nically require the introduction of the ocean\u2013continent transition and\ntemperature dependent non-linear rheologies (e.g. Neves and Neves,\n2009), which considering the main goal referred above was out of\nthe scope of the present work.\n\n4.1. Model setup\n\nThe basic model (MOD1) represents an upper crustal block cover-\ning an area of 480\u00d7180 km, with a thickness of 6 km (Fig. 10A and C).\nThis thickness corresponds to the maximum depth imaged by the\navailable reflection seismics (e.g. TWTT-depth conversion of IAM?4 line\nacross the HAP by Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 1998; Jimenez-Munt et al., 2010).\nThe obtained model results were drawn from a central 240\u00d7180 km\nsubarea, to avoid boundary effects.

This is simulated in the second set of models (MOD2) by an\ninterbedded soft layer (Fig. 10D) with its top surface coinciding with\nthe tip of the strike\u2013slip fault that does not reach the model surface.\nThis mimics the natural example wherein the SWIM 1 Fault shows little\n\nbathymetric expression (see Figs. 2 and 3), only mildly perturbing the\ntop Late Miocene to Plio-Quaternary unit in a few locations, despite al-\nways undoubtedly cutting across the underlying Miocene gravitational\n\u201cChaotic body\u201d unit (see Fig. 5).\n\n4.1.1. Rheologic and fault parameters\n\nAlthough ABAQUS is provided with many material behavior bench-\nmarks, we needed to conduct a large number of systematic tests to se-\nlect the material properties. The most challenging to be constrained\nwere the material properties of the cohesive elements that constitute\nthe faults, since they are commonly calibrated for small-scale fractures\nfound in engineering problems, and not for large-scale geologic faults.\n\nFig. 11.

Results for MOD1 and MOD2 shown for a depth of z=3000 m (base of soft layer in MOD2).\n\n15F.M. Rosas et al. / Tectonophysics 548\u2013549 (2012) 1\u201321\n\nimage of Fig.?11\n\n\nThe adopted approach was to iteratively change the parameters until\ndisplacement and stress solutions compatible with the natural esti-\nmates and observations were found. The Drucker\u2013Prager plasticity\nmodel was chosen to model the brittle crustal behavior. This was\nfound to be numerically more stable than the Mohr\u2013Coulomb model,\nwhich failed to converge at an earlier step in the analysis due to larger\ndeformations. Since we were not interested in examining the details\nof the stress distribution within the soft layer, a simple Von-Mises plas-\nticity model was chosen to model the soft layer in MOD2. A Von-Mises\nmaterial provides a lower yield stress than the surrounding crustal ma-\nterial and simulates a decoupling layer.\n\nThe thrust and strike\u2013slip faults are modeled as layers of cohesive\nelements. These are specifically designed for bonded interfaces where\nthe interface thickness is negligibly small compared to other model\ndimensions. The constitutive response of the cohesive layer is defined\nin terms of an elastic traction versus separation law, i.e. there are three\ncomponents of separation, one normal to the interface and two parallel\nto it. To prevent faults from opening or closing, the normal component\n(E) is much stiffer than the in-plane components (G1 and G2). The\n\nthrust fault cohesive stiffness, G1=G2=30 GPa, is larger than the\nstrike\u2013slip fault cohesive stiffness, G1=G2=10 GPa, following the\nCoulomb\u2013Navier's law of fracture strength. All the material parameters\nare listed in Table 2.\n\n4.1.2. Boundary conditions and procedure\n\nThe boundary conditions try to match those of the analog model-\ning experiments as closely as possible. Deformation is simulated by\nmoving basal plate A to the right relatively to plate B (see Fig. 10A).\nBecause there is some stiffness along the strike\u2013slip fault, plate B is\ndragged by plate A towards the thrust fault. The maximum prescribed\ndisplacement along the X direction was 10 km, yielding a maximum\nshortening of 2%. Both basal plates are fixed in along the Y direction.\nGravity (g=9.8 m/s2) is applied as a body force. To counterbalance\nthe weight of the overlying crust a lithostatic pressure is applied at\nthe bottom of the model. Isostasy is simulated by applying spring\nforces at the bottom of the model with stiffness per unit area equal\nto (?m??w)g where ?m=3300 kg/m3 is the mantle density and\n?w=1000 kg/m3 is the water density.\n\nFig. 12. Comparison of the natural morphotectonic pattern and the obtained analog modeling structural pattern.\n\n16 F.M. Rosas et al. / Tectonophysics 548\u2013549 (2012) 1\u201321\n\nimage of Fig.?12\n\n\n4.2. Model results\n\n4.2.1. Displacement pattern\n\nDeformation of the basic model (MOD1) is illustrated by vertical\ndisplacement contours on a deformed grid (Fig. 10B), which shows\nthat the rightwards push of basal plate A was accommodated by move-\nment along both the thrust and strike\u2013slip faults. Flexure of the plate\nalso occurred in response to the topographical load caused by the\nfault offset, in agreement with the flexural theory of faulting (e.g. Bott,\n1996). For 2% of shortening the maximum throw along the thrust\nfault was 1300 m (Fig. 10B).\n\n4.2.2. Stress and strain distribution\n\nFig. 11A\u2013C depicts the stress and strain distribution in the obtained\nnumerical models. The relatively high concentration of stress in the\ncorner zone of these models (Fig. 11A \u2014 MOD1) agrees with the results\nobtained in the analog experiments (see above). Likewise, the plot of\nprincipal stresses at model surface shows that the stress directions\nclearly rotate near this same corner zone (Fig. 11B \u2014 MOD1), and the\nmaximum compressive stress magnitude increases by a factor of 1/3.\nAdditionally, the obtained pattern of strain distribution also shows sig-\nnificant concentration in the MOD1 corner zone area (Fig. 11C \u2014\nMOD1), confirming that this zone is where tectonic structures are pref-\nerably expected to develop and concentrate, in line with the predictions\ninferred from the analog results.\n\nIn contrast, some decrease of the overall state of stress was generally\nobserved in MOD2 (Fig. 11A \u2014 MOD2). Between plates A and B stress\nwas observed to concentrate at the model surface along a narrow\nband coinciding with the direction of the strike\u2013slip fault, although\nthis was not prescribed to affect the top 1.5 km thick model layer (see\nFig. 10D). In addition, the maximum compressive stress orientation\nshowed a constant obliquity (45\u00b0\u201350\u00b0) relative to the strike\u2013slip direc-\ntion, without any significant variations of magnitude or direction in the\ncorner zone (Fig. 11B \u2014 MOD2). Complying with this stress distribution\nand with the existence of a shallow soft layer, higher amounts of strain\nwere observed to diffusely affect the whole of this layer (Fig. 11C \u2014\nMOD2), while some degree of strain concentration also occurred\nalong the trace of the strike\u2013slip fault.\n\n5. Discussion\n\nBoth analog and numerical modeling results clearly show the impor-\ntance of a corner effect expressed by the deformation pattern that is\nexpected to develop in a brittle medium due to the mechanical interfer-\nence between a dextral strike\u2013slip fault and a thrust, intersecting each\nother at an angle of 120\u00b0/60\u00b0. Analog modeling provides a characteriza-\ntion of the resultant basic structural pattern, revealing its essential\ngeometry and kinematics. Numerical modeling provides insights on the\nway stress and strain are distributed under the same conditions, and\nconsiders the effects of simple rheological variation accounting for a shal-\nlow interbedded soft layer within the same brittle medium.\n\n5.1. Analog modeling output\n\nThe experimentally obtained structural pattern is mostly character-\nized by a concentration in the corner zone of (see Figs. 8 and 9): a)\noblique (dextral-reverse) faults, with different evolving geometries\nand associated kinematics; and b) vertical (dextral) strike\u2013slip Y-faults.\nWhile Y-faults tend to generally maintain their main geometry and kine-\nmatics as strain accumulates in the corner zone, oblique faults do not\nsince they nucleate as segments of originally pure thrusts that progres-\nsively propagate and rotate from the thrust-front to the wrench domain\n(see Fig. 8). This propagation-rotation is matched by a corresponding\nchange in kinematics; from pure (reverse dip\u2013slip) thrusting, to oblique\n(transcurrent dominant) dextral-reverse faulting. Early formed faults\nundergo a greater amount of more abrupt rotation, with their planes\n\nbeing more promptly parallelized to the basal strike\u2013slip direction (F2\nin Fig. 8A2 and B, and F3 in Fig. 8C). As strain continues to accumulate\nin the corner zone, these same planes also become steeper (from an\noriginal dip of ~30\u00b0), and eventually subparallel to the Y-faults, prefer-\nably accommodating dextral strike\u2013slip movement (see for instance\nin F3 and F4 in cross section 4 of Fig. 9B). Later (outer) faults in the cor-\nner zone endure relatively less displacement, and thus are less rotated\nand steepened, striking somewhat subperpendicularly to the bisector\nof the angle defined by the thrust-front and the wrenching domains\n(see for instance F5 in Fig. 9A and cross section 5).\n\nThese results show that in this particular structural setting faults ge-\nnetically related either to the wrench or to the thrust system do not evo-\nlve independently. Active strike\u2013slip faulting in the wrench domain\nsimultaneously triggers reverse (dip\u2013slip) faulting in the thrust domain,\nwhich subsequently evolves to reverse oblique\u2013slip faulting towards\nthe corner zone.\n\n5.2. Numerical modeling output\n\nThe numerical modeling results also strengthen the working hy-\npothesis of the existence of a thrust\u2013wrench interference corner ef-\nfect, in accordance with the structural pattern obtained in the analog\nexperiments. Stress and strain contours obtained for MOD1 reveal a\nconsistent concentration of both in the corner zone area (see Fig. 11A\nto C \u2014 MOD1). This agrees with the high concentration of faults that\ncharacterizes the corner zone in the analog models (see Figs. 8 and 9).\nAlso, the rotation of the stress field and of the maximum compressive\nstress in the MOD1 corner zone (see Fig. 11B \u2014 MOD1) agrees with\nthe described geometry and kinematics of early formed (inner) faults\nin the analog models, specifically with their steep planar attitude and\ndominant-transcurrent oblique kinematics (see F3 and F4 in Fig. 9A\nand cross section 4). In MOD2 strain diffusion in the soft (decoupled)\nlayer (see Fig. 11C \u2014 MOD2) caused a decrease of the overall state of\nstress at the model surface, and hindered stress concentration in the\ncorner zone (Fig. 11A and C \u2014 MOD2). The fact that the prescribed\nstrike\u2013slip fault in MOD2 does not breach out, explains the observed\nrelative concentration of stress along a narrow band coincident with\nthe direction of the underlying strike\u2013slip fault (Fig. 11A \u2014 MOD2).\nThis also complies with the observed constant obliquity of the maxi-\nmum compressive stress relatively to that same strike\u2013slip direction\n(Fig. 11B \u2014 MOD2).\n\n5.3. Comparison with the natural example and tectonic implications\n\nThe obtained analog modeling results are consistent with the nat-\nural structural pattern revealed by the morphotectonic interpretation\nof the HAP corner zone area (Fig. 12). Similarities between model and\nnatural example are given by the fault pattern, which contains struc-\ntures with similar geometries and kinematics. Such model-prototype\ncongruence shows that the observed natural tectonic pattern is the\nresult of thrust\u2013wrench interference between the SWIM 1 and Horse-\nshoe faults.\n\nThe modeled interdependency between both these fault systems,\nagrees with a possible multi-rupture scenario involving coeval strike\u2013\nslip faulting in the wrenching domain (SWIM system), reverse-faulting\nin the thrust domain (Horseshoe system), and sequentially induced\noblique, dextral-reverse faulting in corner zone (SWIM 1\u2013HTF intersec-\ntion). Multi-rupture scenarios have been documented in other places\ninvolving dominant transcurrent continental fault-systems, in which\nmain strike\u2013slip earthquakes trigger thrust-related aftershocks, general-\nly nucleating in restraining bends subsidiary of the main transcurrent\nsystem (e.g. Gobi\u2013Altay Fault and San Andreas Fault, Bayarsayhan et\nal., 1996, Kurushin et al., 1997). Although also in continental domains,\nwrench\u2013thrust interference faulting is likewise known to be associated\nto complex rupture, comprising triggering of thrust faulting only tens\nof seconds after strike\u2013slip faulting (e.g. 1976 Tangshan earthquake,\n\n17F.M. Rosas et al. / Tectonophysics 548\u2013549 (2012) 1\u201321\n\n\n\nButler et al., 1979). In the Gulf of Cadiz, multi-rupture associated to some\nkind of interference between different faults (e.g. HTF, MPF and SWIM)\nhas also been proposed by previous authors (e.g. Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003a,b;\nTerrinha et al., 2003, 2009; Zitellini et al., 2001). Specifically in the pre-\nsent case, and given the dimension of the faults at stake, rupture areas\nassociated to the corresponding earthquakes could hardly justify the en-\nergy release implied by high magnitude events (M>8.5), such as the\n1755 Great Lisbon Earthquake (Gutscher et al., 2009b). Nonetheless,\nthe potential multi-rupture associated to the study thrust\u2013wrench tec-\ntonic interference should be taken into consideration while addressing\nseismic hazards for low to moderate magnitude events (Mwb6.0).\n\nIn the study area, recent reports on the local seismicity corresponding\nto these low to moderate magnitude events (Geissler et al., 2010; Silva\net al., 2010) showed a strong concentration in the SWIM1\u2013HTF corner\nzone (see Fig. 6). However, as mentioned above, it is critical to note\nthat these earthquakes are located at depths mostly comprised between\n40 and 55 km, corresponding to the base of the seismogenic layer (with-\nin lithospheric mantle), whilst in the available MCS profiles corner faults\nare imaged at maximum depths of only ~6\u201310 km (e.g. CF1 and CF2 in\nFig. 5). While strike\u2013slip faults can easily be extrapolated vertically to\ngreat depths, major lithospheric thrust faults are expected to vary their\ndip as a function of depth and correspondent rheology, and thus a non-\nnegligible horizontal offset between the fault traces and the earthquake\nepicenters should be expected. However, in the present case, epicenters\nare preferably concentrated merely ~14 and ~25 km to the SE of CF1\nand CF2 faults, respectively (see Fig. 6). It is thus difficult to envisage a\ndirect connection between these faults, imaged at upper crustal depths,\nand the reported seismicity originated at lithospheric mantle depths.\n\nIt is therefore more likely that the studied thrust\u2013wrench interfer-\nence corner effect recognized in the upper-crust could also exist at\ndeeper lithospheric levels. According to this idea, a replication of sim-\nilar tectonic interference patterns would occur at different depths, in\ndifferent lithospheric layers with similar (competent) bulk rheologies,\nas a consequence of similar stress regimes. This is supported by the con-\ngruency between the variable orientation of the seismically imaged\nfaults (at upper crustal depths), and the variation of planes deduced\nfrom focal mechanisms (at mantle lithospheric depths). These focal\nmechanisms were reported as somewhat heterogeneous by Geissler et\nal. (2010), although mostly compatible with reverse and strike\u2013slip\nfaulting. This agrees with the modeled thrust\u2013wrench tectonic scenario\nas shown by the obtained interference structural pattern in the analog\nmodels, where corner zone faults assume evolving different geometries\nand kinematics ranging from pure thrust to pure strike\u2013slip (see Figs. 8\nand 9).\n\nGeissler et al. (2010) also proposed a direction of principal stress\ncomponents, based on the estimated average stress tensors consistent\nwith the fault slip orientations from focal mechanisms. Accordingly,\nthe maximum compressive stress rotates from an approximately E\u2013W\ndirection, near the northern termination of the HTF (?1 \u2014 N103\u00b0E/26\u00b0\nstrike/plunge, Fig. 6), to a more N\u2013S direction in the corner zone\n(?1 \u2014 N351\u00b0/12\u00b0, Fig. 6), roughly bisecting the angle between the\nSWIM 1 and the Horseshoe Thrust Fault. This rotation complies, not\nonly with the corner zone rotation of the maximum compressive stress\nobtained for MOD1 numerical results (see Fig. 11B \u2014 MOD1), but also\nwith the orientation of the characteristic oblique corner faults, observed\nboth in the analog model and natural structural patterns (see Figs. 8, 9\nand 12).\n\nThe idea that similar thrust\u2013wrench tectonic interference can ex-\npress itself in a decoupled manner at different (crustal and mantle)\nlithospheric depths, could explain the recurrently recognized spatial\ndiscrepancy in the Gulf of Cadiz between: (a) the mapped main\ntectonic structures, and (b) the dominant low to intermediate \u201cback-\nground\u201d seismicity (Mwb6.0), to which specific major faults are gener-\nally difficult to assign. This agrees with the conspicuous relative absence\nof earthquakes at lower crust\u2013upper mantle depths (between ~15 and\n40 km, see Fig. 6, Geissler et al., 2010; Silva et al., 2010), which could\n\nalso be related to this fault interference pattern. In fact, the WAS data\nreported by Sallar\u00e8s et al. (2011), although based on a profile located fur-\nther to the east (see Fig. 1B), showed the existence of (oceanic) crust\nand upper mantle low velocities, which were interpreted by these\nauthors as the result of alteration and serpentinization caused by fluid\npercolation through fault-related rock fractures. The authors specifically\nsuggest that the SWIM faults, which in their WAS profile are also spatial-\nly coincident with low-marked velocity anomalies, probably play an im-\nportant role in this rock alteration process. Thus, in the present study\narea, the newly discovered (corner zone) fault interference pattern\ncould likewise powerfully assist abundant fluid percolation through a\nwidespread network of fault-related rock fractures, promoting crustal\nalteration and mantle serpentinization possibly even in a more efficient\nand generalized way. This could explain the reported existence of earth-\nquake only at mantle depths of >40 km (and b55 km, Geissler et al.,\n2010), where the reach of this softening alteration/serpentinization ef-\nfect would tend to be attenuated.\n\nIt should be noted that in the Gulf of Cadiz this lower crustal\u2013upper\nmantle fluid-related alteration effect, although generally reported as\nbeing associated to tectonic fault channeling, is also thought to be pos-\nsible to occur more pervasively, in areas away from the main tectonic\nfaults. Accordingly, lower upper-mantle velocities were described by\nPurdy (1975) and Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (1996) in the Horseshoe Abyssal\nPlain, similar to velocities reported in the Tagus Abyssal Plain as being\nrelated to mantle serpentinization in the local Ocean\u2013Continental Tran-\nsition Zone (Pinheiro et al., 1992).\n\nAnother point to consider is the location of the continent\u2013ocean\nboundary in the present study area. The implied abrupt thickness and\nmarked rheological contrast associated to such a boundary would\nexert a critical influence on depth nucleation of major tectonic struc-\ntures, possibly including the ones associated to both the SWIM and\nthe HTF systems. Future modeling work should thus consider the pro-\nposal of Sallar\u00e8s et al. (2011) (see Fig. 1B), assuming for the study\narea the location of the COB at a distance of ~100 km from the southern\nIberian coast line.\n\nRheology-controlled decoupling is also illustrated at a different scale\nin the upper crust by MOD2 numerical modeling results, which show\nthat an interbedded soft layer can be responsible for a significant degree\nof strain diffusion and delocalization (Fig. 11C \u2014 MOD2), hindering the\nnucleation and upward propagation of faults, and thus inhibiting the\nmorphological expression of the fault interference pattern in the corner\nzone. This could explain the poor bathymetric expression of the corner\nzone structural pattern in the HAP seafloor, caused by a soft-like rheo-\nlogical behavior of the Late Miocene gravitational \u201cChaotic Body\u201d unit.\n\n6. Conclusions\n\nThe following main conclusions are drawn:\n\na) The newly discovered tectonic pattern in the area of intersection\n(corner zone) between the SWIM 1 and the Horseshoe faults formed\nas the result of tectonic interference between active strike\u2013slip and\nthrust faulting, respectively.\n\nb) Modeling results show that in the corner zone domain a preferred\nconcentration of stress and strain occurs (corner effect); the latter\nbeing mainly accommodated by reverse oblique faulting, with\nfaults exhibiting different evolving geometries and kinematics as\nthey endure some degree of rotation. A multi-rupture scenario\nwithin the active tectonic framework of the connected SWIM 1\nand HTF systems can thus be envisaged, and should be carefully\nconsidered when assessing the seismic-related hazards of low to\nmoderate seismicity (Mwb6.0) in the Gulf of Cadiz region.\n\nc) In the SWIM 1\u2013HTF corner zone the tectonic pattern is seismically im-\naged at upper crustal depths, whereas the local seismicity is reported\nto preferentially occur in the lithospheric mantle (Geissler et al.,\n2010). Nonetheless, faults and seismicity data are congruent in a\n\n18 F.M. Rosas et al. / Tectonophysics 548\u2013549 (2012) 1\u201321\n\n\n\nnumber of aspects (orientation of fault planes and planes deduced\nfrom focal mechanisms, fault kinematics and focal mechanisms,\ncompatibility with similar stress field orientation). This suggests a\npossible occurrence of similar thrust\u2013wrench tectonic interference\nat different lithospheric depth-levels with comparable (competent)\nrheologies. Accordingly, an intermediate lower crust\u2013upper mantle\naseismic depth domain could be explained by pervasive alteration/\nserpentinization, prompted by fluid percolation through fault-\nrelated fractures associated with the newly revealed corner zone\n(thrust\u2013wrench) fault-network.\n\nd) Numerical modeling results also illustrate the influence that rheo-\nlogical stratigraphy might exert on the nucleation and propagation\nof the corner zone fault pattern in the upper crust. Specifically, an\ninterbedded soft layer is shown to inhibit the stress\u2013strain corner\nzone concentration in the overlying competent layer. In accordance,\nthe mild morphological (bathymetric) expression of the corner zone\ninterference tectonic pattern in the HAP seafloor could eventually be\nexplained by strain delocalization/diffusion, and consequent lack of\nfault propagation, induced by the presence of a rheologically soft\nLate Miocene gravitational \u201cChaotic\u201d unit. Confirmation of such a\npossibility should be tested by future work assessing the relationship\nbetween the presence of this seismostratigraphic unit, and the atten-\nuation of the bathymetric expression of the (seismically imaged)\ntectonic structures at stake. Likewise, future modeling on this issue\nshould also take into account existent syn- and post-tectonic sedi-\nmentation rates, particularly in the HAP where these are expected\nto have a crucial influence on preserving/obliterating the bathy-\nmetric record of active tectonics (Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2010; Lebreiro et al.,\n1997; Zitellini et al., 2009).\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nExperiments were performed in the Analogue Modeling Lab of\nInstituto Dom Luiz (IDL), a research Associate Laboratory funded\nby FCT.

According to the scale model\n\ntheory (Hubbert, 1937), proper scaling is achieved when the ratios ?,\n? and ? between model and natural prototype are independently\nestablished for the three fundamental units of length (L), time (T) and\nmass (M), respectively:\n\n? \u00bc\nL m\u00f0 \u00de\nL p\u00f0 \u00de\n\n; ? \u00bc\nT m\u00f0 \u00de\nT p\u00f0 \u00de\n\n; ? \u00bc\nM m\u00f0 \u00de\nM p\u00f0 \u00de\n\n\u00f02\u00de\n\nwhere (m) stands for model and (p) for natural prototype. The Coulomb\nfracture criterion governs time independent deformation of brittle ma-\nterials, since yield stress is insensitive to the rate of deformation provid-\ned that the inertial forces are negligible, as in the present case. Thus, ?\nratio is redundant for the present scaling. Length ratio (?) was chosen\ngiven the dimensions of the employed deformation apparatus (see\nSection 3.1.2 and Fig. 7A) as ?=5\u00d710?6. Of the two relevant material\nproperties, coefficient of internal friction (?c) and cohesion (c0), the first\nis dimensionless, and approximately the same in both model and proto-\ntype (see Table 1), whereas the second has dimension of stress and thus\nmust be scaled accordingly (Hubbert, 1937):\n\n? \u00bc\nc0 m\u00f0 \u00de\nc0 p\u00f0 \u00de\n\n\u00bc\n??\n\n?2\n\u00f03\u00de\n\nwhere ? and ? are the model/prototype ratio for stress and for acceler-\nation respectively. Since inertial forces are negligible when compared\nwith gravity,\n\n? \u00bc ?g \u00bc\ng m\u00f0 \u00de\ng p\u00f0 \u00de\n\n\u00bc\n?\n\n?2\n\u00bc 1 \u00f04\u00de\n\nwhere ?g is the model/prototype gravity acceleration ratio. Thus,\nsubstituting ?=1in Eq. (3) allows the following simplification:\n\n? \u00bc\nc0 m\u00f0 \u00de\nc0 p\u00f0 \u00de\n\n\u00bc\n?\n\n?2\n\u00bc\n\n??\n\n?3\n\u00bc ?? \u00f05\u00de\n\nwhere ? corresponds to the model/prototype density ratio. Substituting\n? and ? in Eq. (5) by the respective values of Table 1, immediately allows\nthe determination of the implied mass ratio ?=6.25\u00d710?17.\n\nReferences\n\nAbe, K., 1979.

The results we obtained and the comparison with the natural deformation pattern favor a\n\ntectonic evolution comprising two main steps: i) the formation of the Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge on\n\ntop of inactive, Tethyan-related, basement faults (Middle Miocene to ~1.8 Ma); ii) subsequent reactivation\n\nof these basement faults with dextral strike-slip motion (~1.8 Ma to present) simultaneously with continued\n\ntectonic accretion in the GCAW. These results exclude the possibility of ongoing active SWIM wrench system\n\ncross-cutting an inactive GCAW structure. Our results also support a new interpretation of the SWIM wrench\n\nsystem as fundamentally resulting from strike-slip reactivation of an old (Tethyan-related) plate boundary.\n\n\u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction\n\nThe Gulf of Cadiz is situated in the North-East Atlantic Ocean, west\nof the Gibraltar Straits, offshore SW Iberia and NW Morocco (Fig. 1).\nThis zone marks the transition between the Mediterranean Alpine\nCollision Belt and the Atlantic Azores\u2013Gibraltar Fracture Zone\n(AGFZ; see Fig. 1) and corresponds to a segment of the Africa\u2013Eurasia\nplate boundary previously described as tectonically diffuse (e.g.\nSartori et al., 1994; Medialdea et al., 2004). Accordingly, a variety of\ntectonic structures with different orientations, corresponding mostly\nto W\u2013NW directed thrusts and WNW\u2013ESE dextral strike-slip faults\n(Fig. 1B), are thought to accommodate a WNW\u2013ESE present conver-\ngence between Eurasia (Iberia sub-plate) and Africa (Nubia sub-\nplate) at a rate of ca. 4\u20135 mm/year (Argus et al., 1989; DeMets et al.,\n1994; Sella et al., 2002; Calais et al., 2003; Fernandes et al., 2003;\nFernandes, 2004; Nocquet and Calais, 2004; Fernandes et al., 2007).\n\nThe seismicity of this domain has been characterized as moderate,\nalthough several high magnitude historical and instrumental earth-\nquakes are known (e.g. Ms=7.9 28/02/1969 and Mw=6.0, 12/02/\n2007 earthquakes respectively, Fukao, 1973 and Stich et al., 2006,\n2007). Among these, the 1755 Great Lisbon Earthquake (estimated\nmagnitude of 8.5 to 8.7; Abe, 1979; Johnston, 1996; Martinez-\nSolares and L\u00f3pez Arroyo, 2004) triggered a devastating tsunami\nand destroyed the Portuguese capital (Baptista et al., 1998; Zitellini\net al., 2001; Martinez-Solares and L\u00f3pez Arroyo, 2004). Despite recent\nmapping updates of the main tectonic structures of this region based\non the interpretation of a great variety of newly acquired data (e.g.\nmulti-beam swath bathymetry, reflection and refraction seismics,\ngeodetic; Johnston, 1996; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 1996; Zitellini et al., 2001;\nGutscher et al., 2002, 2009a,b; Baptista et al., 2003; Gr\u00e0cia et al.,\n2003a,b; Mulder et al., 2003; Zitellini et al., 2004; Rosas et al., 2009;\nTerrinha et al., 2009; Zitellini et al., 2009), the precise location of\nthe seismogenic/tsunamigenic source of 1755 major event is still\nthe subject of ongoing debate (e.g. Baptista et al., 1998; Buforn et\nal., 1988; Zitellini et al., 2001; Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003a,b; Terrinha et al.,\n2003; Gutscher, 2004; Gutscher, 2006; Terrinha et al., 2009).\n\nIn the tectonic map of Fig. 1B three main sets of structures are im-\nmediately recognized: a) several NE\u2013SW striking, westward directed\n\nMarine Geology 289 (2011) 135\u2013149\n\n?

Structures of the\nfirst set have previously been described as active and, individually\n(e.g. Gorringe fault), or together (Marques de Pombal and Horseshoe\n\nFig. 1.

The other two sets of tectonic structures sup-\nport the following two fundamental ideas for the interpretation of\nthe Gulf of Cadiz tectonic framework (Gutscher et al., 2002; Zitellini\net al., 2009):\n\n- Gutscher et al. (2002), building on previously reported similar\nideas (e.g. Royden, 1993 and Lonergan and White, 1997), consid-\nered the tectonic evolution of this plate boundary as being domi-\nnated by active (roll back) subduction of a retreating east-dipping\nlithospheric slab, presently positioned beneath the Gibraltar Arc\n(Fig. 1B). Accordingly, associated synthetic accretion of sedi-\nments is also reported to occur, represented by the Gulf of Cadiz\nAccretionary Wedge (GCAW, Fig. 1B), in which several\nimbricated west-directed active thrusts accommodate on-going\nshortening.\n\n- Zitellini et al. (2009) argued for the existence of a broad transpres-\nsive deformation band, comprising a set of WNW\u2013ESE striking,\nsubvertical, dextral strike-slip faults (SWIM faults in Fig. 1B),\nwhich as a whole extend for more than 600 km, from the eastern\npart of the Gulf of Cadiz to the southern limit of the Gorringe bank.\nThese faults are interpreted by the cited authors as lithospheric\nfaults, and in view of that the SWIM fault system was proposed\nto mark a newly formed plate boundary connecting the AGFZ to\nthe Rif Mountain belt in northern Morocco.\n\nIt should be noted that Zitellini et al. (2009) considered the dex-\ntral transcurrent SWIM faults in the Gulf of Cadiz as presently active,\nand cutting the GCAW thrusts, whose activity is considered to be neg-\nligible since late Miocene times. Conversely, Gutscher et al. (2002)\nconsidered the GCAW thrusts as still active, and as referred above re-\nlated with present on-going subduction beneath the Gibraltar arc.\n\nIn the present work, we test the above assumptions using analog\nmodeling sand-box experiments to model the interference between\nthe two major tectonic systems in the Gulf of Cadiz, i.e. SWIM dextral\nwrenching and GCAW thrusting, assuming three main different\npossibilities:\n\n1) The GCAW is presently active and the SWIM faults are thought to\ncorrespond to inactive basement faults, inherited from a previous\ntectonic evolution;\n\n2) The SWIM faults are thought to correspond to major, presently ac-\ntive, dextral strike-slips, cutting a previously formed inactive\nGCAW;\n\n3) Both tectonic systems are presently active.\n\nThorough comparison of the obtained results with the observed\nnatural morphotectonic pattern is carried out for each of the above\ncases. Accordingly, resulting tectonic implications for the local and\nwhole scale evolution of this segment of the Eurasia\u2013Africa plate\nboundary are evaluated and explored.\n\n2. Morphotectonic characterization of the study area\n\nThe morphology of the Gulf of Cadiz is largely controlled by the\nmain tectonic processes in the area: the thrusting accommodating\nthe GCAW accretion and the wrenching associated to the SWIM\nfault system. The high-resolution bathymetry of the GCAW shows a\nwest dipping U-shaped body (Figs. 1B and 2A) that extends for\nmore than 250 km from about longitude 7\u00b0W to 9\u00b030?W, with depths\nranging from 200 to 4300 m. It narrows slightly to the west with a\nwidth varying from 160 to 140 km (see Figs. 1B and 2A). Its wrinkled\nsurface morphology is shaped not only by thrust-related slope breaks\nand associated folds, which define a large scale stepping morphology,\n\nbut is also the result of the different combined manifestations of grav-\nitational and fluid escape processes (e.g. \u201craft-tectonics\u201d type fea-\ntures, sub-circular collapse depressions, mud volcanoes, salt diapirs;\nMulder et al., 2003; Pinheiro et al., 2003; Gutscher et al., 2009b;\nTerrinha et al., 2009; Zitellini et al., 2009). From a structural point of\nview, the accretionary wedge corresponds to an eastward thickening\npile of westward thrust sediments (Fig. 2B and C), reaching a maxi-\nmum thickness of ca. 15 km near the Gibraltar Straits (Thiebot and\nGutscher, 2006; Gutscher et al., 2009a). The thrusts root in a common\nsub-horizontal to gently east dipping decollement layer, exhibiting an\noverall geometry complying with on-going eastward subduction be-\nneath the Gibraltar Arc (Gutscher et al., 2002). During the last 5 Ma,\nthe E\u2013W convergence rate implied in such a subduction is thought\nto have diminished from ca. 2 cm/year to 0.5 cm/year (Gutscher et\nal., 2009a), with a consequent decrease in the activity of the wedge\nthrusts during this time span. Accordingly, the same authors argue\nthat the present internal deformation is preferentially accommodated\nby small increments of local reactivation of inherited blind thrusts,\nbeing more homogeneously distributed over the entire wedge, rather\nthan concentrated on newly formed major frontal thrusts.\n\nThe morphologic expression of the SWIM faults corresponds to a\ncontinuous alignment of seafloor crests and troughs, sometimes exhi-\nbiting an en-\u00e9chelon geometrical disposition, and commonly punctu-\nated by active mud volcanoes within the domain of the accretionary\nwedge (see Fig. 1B; Duarte et al., 2009; Terrinha et al., 2009; Zitellini\net al., 2009). This overall linear morphology is more prominent both\nclose to the northern part of the GCAW front and in the Horseshoe\nValley, where lineaments can be followed almost continuously for\nmore than 200 km (e.g. SWIM 1 in Figs. 1B and 3A). The available re-\nflection seismic dataset in the study area shows that SWIM faults cor-\nrespond to aligned arrays of deep-rooted faults, often breaching out\nthrough the present seafloor sediments and showing extensive evi-\ndence for associated fluid migration (e.g. seismic blanking along\nfluid extrusion paths in Fig. 3B and C; Rosas et al., 2009; Terrinha et\nal., 2009). From the inspection of the IAM 4 and 3 seismic profiles in\nFig. 3, it is apparent that the SWIM faults are aligned along basement\npre-existent (Mesozoic) faults (dashed black lines in Fig. 3; see also\nDuarte et al., 2009 and Terrinha et al., 2009). Analog modeling of\nsets of en-\u00e9chelon folds formed in soft-cover sediments overlying\nsome of the SWIM basement dextral strike-slips (Rosas et al., 2009)\nyielded an age for their activity of ca. 1.8 Ma.\n\n2.1. The SWIM\u2013GCAW interference area\n\nThe critical area to understand the interference between the\nSWIM strike-slips and the GCAW is close to its deformation front\n(Fig. 4A). Along this front, from north to south, three interference\nsub-areas were thoroughly analyzed (B to D in Fig. 4). The SWIM 2\nfault intersects a northern segment of the GCAW front (Fig. 4B) in\nthe vicinity of the Sagres Valley, at an angle of about 40\u00b0. Within the\nthrust wedge to the east, the morphological expression of the SWIM\n2 is well marked by a slightly arched trough that splays in the same\ndirection. Conversely, in the Sagres Valley it is almost indiscernible\ndue to the widespread presence of scours and slumps, and it is only\ndetectable by the presence of a gentle slope break. In this area no off-\nset of the wedge deformation front is observed, instead only a small\nwrinkled WNW\u2013ESE elongate bulge can be detected in the bathyme-\ntry of the frontal GCAW (see Fig. 4B). The SWIM 1 fault exhibits a\nclear morphological expression in the Horseshoe Valley, intersecting\nthe wedge deformation front just to the north of the Coral Patch\nRidge, at an angle of about 70\u00b0 (Fig. 4C). Its continuation to the east\nis less visible, although punctuated by mud volcanoes. Similarly to\nwhat was described for the SWIM 2 fault, there is no bathymetric\nevidence for the offset of the wedge front by the SWIM 1 fault. The\nSWIM 3 fault cuts along the southern flank of the Coral Patch Ridge\nwith a strong morphological imprint (Fig. 4D), corresponding to a\n\n137J.C. Duarte et al. / Marine Geology 289 (2011) 135\u2013149\n\n\n\nlineament marked by several elongated WNW\u2013ESE ridges, troughs\nand slope breaks. To the east, this lineament crosses a small portion\nof the Seine Abyssal Plain and intersects the accretionary wedge\ndeformation front, at an angle of about 80\u00b0. In this location the\nwedge front is marked by a slight embayment. On the wedge surface\nto the north of the fault and parallel to it, an elongated protuberance\nis also unmistakably observed, limited by two descending slope\nbreaks and vanishing progressively toward the east. As in the two\ncases described above, the observed morphology does not account\nfor any kind of fault offset overprint relationships.\n\n3. Analog modeling\n\nOur objective is to test several simple chronological possibilities\nof mechanical interference between a strike-slip fault and a thrust\nwedge front, under model conditions comparable to the ones govern-\ning the SWIM\u2013GCAW tectonic interference. Three main experiments\nwere carried out to investigate the different deformation patterns\nresulting from: a) A thrust wedge developed on top of an inactive\nbasement (strike-slip) fault; b) An active dextral strike-slip fault af-\nfecting an inactive thrust wedge; c) The simultaneous alternate activ-\nity of a thrust wedge front and a dextral strike-slip fault. Experiments\nwere performed to respect the general, simplified, geometry, kine-\nmatics and rheology ascribed to the natural strike-slip (SWIM) sys-\ntem and to the (GCAW) thrust wedge. However, analog modeling\nwith dry granular materials cannot reproduce all the complex\n\nprocesses (e.g. fluid overpressure and expulsion, sedimentary deposi-\ntion, and local gravitational instabilities) which occur in submarine\nenvironments. Nevertheless, the regional kinematic and relative tim-\ning caused by the local tectonic driving forces and the ensuing struc-\ntural evolution can be well investigated.\n\n3.1. Experimental method\n\n3.1.1. Material properties and scaling\n\nThe material used as an analog of the GCAW sedimentary rocks\nwas dry quartz sand, whose properties are summarized in Table 1.\nSand is considered a Coulomb material deforming in a brittle way\naccording to the Coulomb fracture criterion (e.g. Hubbert, 1937,\n1951; Davis et al., 1983, Appendix A), and it has been extensively\nused in scaled model experiments simulating similar brittle deforma-\ntion in the upper crust (e.g. Mandl et al., 1977; Mulugeta, 1988; Casas\net al., 2001; Marques and Cobbold, 2002).\n\nThe present models were properly scaled according to the scale\nmodel theory of Hubbert (1937). The assumed model \u2014 prototype\nratios are presented in Table 1, and the detailed procedure of scaling\nis specified in Appendix A.\n\n3.1.2. Apparatus and initial stage\n\nExperiments were done using a rectangular 100 cm\u00d760 cm\nPerspex deformation rig, comprising two laterally juxtaposed basal\nplates and a moving backstop (Fig. 5A).

Duarte et al. / Marine Geology 289 (2011) 135\u2013149\n\nimage of Fig.?4\n\n\nexperiments, 1 cm thick layered sand cake was built on top of the\nbasal rigid plates by pouring batches of differently colored sand\nfrom a moving elongated funnel, guaranteeing the leveling of its top\nsurface. The basal plates in the model move laterally relatively to\neach other, and account for the natural basement beneath the thrust\nwedge decollement (see Fig. 2C). The vertical contact plane between\nthese plates complies with the dominant WNW\u2013ESE orientation of\nthe SWIM 1 fault system (see Figs. 1 and 4). The model sand cake cor-\nresponds to the overlying cover sediments, in which accretion is sim-\nulated by pushing against it a backstop that slides on top of both basal\nplates. The backstop lacks any kind of correspondence with any natu-\nral feature, and was exclusively used to produce a classical model\nthrust wedge. Likewise the (~0.2 cm thick) layering in the sand cake\nhas also no correspondence with any natural structures, and was\nused merely as a 3D passive strain marker. In all experiments the di-\nmensions of the deformation rig were sufficiently large to guarantee\nthat the bulk of the model was not affected by boundary conditions.\nThe experiments were repeated several times to ensure the reproduc-\nibility of the obtained results. Top view photographs were taken at\nregular time intervals. The final stage of the model was humidified\nand serially sectioned for three-dimensional analysis.\n\n3.1.3. Procedure\n\nThree main experiments were carried out to study three basic pos-\nsibilities of mechanical interference between a strike-slip basement\nfault and a thrust wedge:\n\n1) Active thrust wedge and inactive basement fault: the backstop\nwas initially pushed against the sand-cake, on top of the two\nimmobile basal plates.\n\n2) Active basement fault and inactive thrust wedge: after a thrust\nwedge was previously formed in the sand, the basal plates were\ndextrally moved relatively to each other.\n\n3) Active basement fault and active thrust wedge: the reactivation of\na previously formed thrust wedge was successively alternated\nwith the right-lateral movement between the basal plates.\n\n3.2. Experimental results\n\n3.2.1. Experiment 1: active thrust wedge and inactive basement fault\n\nUp until ~30% of shortening a thrust wedge was classically obtained,\nthrough the forward propagation of regularly spaced thrusts, as a result\nof moving the backstop to the left (see Figs. 5B and 6A). For a shortening\nof 31% (Fig. 6A) the front of the accretionary wedge developed an em-\nbayment coinciding with the direction of the inactive basement fault\n(yellow dashed line in Fig. 6A). For a shortening of 38% a new thrust\n(n+1 in Fig. 6B) was formed exclusively to the north of that basement\ndiscontinuity. Only when the shortening reached 39%, did the equiva-\nlent new thrust form to the south, resulting in a misleading left-lateral\noffset geometry (yellow arrows in Fig. 6C), in spite of the total absence\nof relative movement between the two basal rigid plates. For a shorten-\ning of 48% this false offset in front of the newer thrust disappeared\n(Fig. 6D). In the wedge lower area a linear southeastward splaying,\nslightly anastomosing, deformation pattern (white lines in Fig. 6D)\nwas progressively developed as shortening accumulated and new out-\nward thrusts successively formed.\n\n3.2.2. Experiment 2: active basement fault and inactive thrust wedge\n\nAfter 48% of shortening the basement strike-slip fault was activat-\ned with dextral movement (Fig. 7) When the horizontal displacement\nbetween the basal plates reached only 0.2 cm, a thin elongated bulge\nformed coinciding with the basement strike-slip direction (Fig. 7A).\nAt this stage no offset of the thrust wedge was observed. A further\nright-lateral displacement of 0.6 cm between the basal plates clearly\noffset the thrust wedge, preferably affecting its frontal outer thrust\n(Fig. 7B). For a displacement of 1.3 cm the strike-slip fault seemingly\npropagated inward, but only across the following three thrusts\n(Fig. 7C\u2013D). The resultant model deformation pattern always showed\nthe preferential offset of the frontal thin part of the accretionary\nwedge, relative to its innermost domains that remained unaffected.\n\n3.2.3. Experiment 3: active basement fault and active thrust wedge\n\nAfter the formation of a thrust wedge due to 47% of shortening, a\nright-lateral displacement of 1 cm was applied to the basal plates\n(Fig. 8A). As a result, a linear bulge formed in the sand foreland,\n\nTable 1\n\nParameters and material properties. Note: Scaled fundamental units are in bold.

Similarly to experiment 2, the amount of right-\nlateral displacement diminished toward the thicker inner part of the\nwedge. Subsequently, another 0.4% of incremental shortening was\napplied to the model (Fig. 8B). As a result, a new frontal thrust\nformed, but only to the north of the strike-slip fault. The resultant\ngeometry mimics a false left-lateral offset of the outer frontal thrust\n(apparent as n+1 in Fig. 8B), although careful consideration of the\npropagation chronology of the thrusts revealed a true dextral offset\n(affecting thrust n in Fig. 8B), complying with the underlying base-\nment fault kinematics. Further 1% of applied shortening (Fig. 8C) pro-\nduced the new thrust (n+1) also to the south of the strike-slip fault,\nerasing the previously formed false offset. Another 3.5 cm of dextral\nstrike-slip displacement was additionally applied to the basal plates\n(Fig. 8D), and as a consequence, the wedge front was once more kine-\nmatically truly dextrally offset. Riedel faults formed on the wedge\nsurface displaying a clear en-\u00e9chelon spatial disposition, and interfer-\ning with the preexistent stepping morphology associated with the\nthrust stacking. Finally, after another 2.6% of shortening (Fig. 9),\nreaching a total accumulated amount of 51%, the frontal wedge offset\nwas once again almost completely attenuated, although the total\naccumulated basal strike-slip displacement was of 4.5 cm (corre-\nsponding to 22.5 km). It should be noted that the previously formed\nlinear en-\u00e9chelon pattern was preserved in the wedge surface, includ-\ning in its innermost domain.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nExperiment 1 shows that an active thrust wedge forming in cover\nsediments above an inactive basement fault records the resultant me-\nchanical interference in the form of a linear, inner splaying, perturba-\ntion of the wedge morphological surface (white lines in Fig. 6C\u2013D).\nThis formed as the result of the successive thrust propagation across\nthe basement anisotropy, which behaved as a mechanical obstacle\nfor the lateral propagation of the frontal thrust. Since this basement\nanisotropy remains stationary relatively to an external reference\nframe, and the thrust front propagates forward (to the left), the resul-\ntant interference area between both these features migrates from the\nlower periphery of the thrust front to its central domain (compare the\nposition of the linear perturbation pattern in Fig. 6A to D). Compari-\nson with the natural example shows that the observed inner splaying\n\nlineaments in the GCAW (see SWIM 1 in Fig. 1B and SWIM 2 in\nFig. 4B), could have originated simply as a consequence of preexisting\ninactive basement faults. This agrees with the fact that these linea-\nments are observed in the inner thicker part of the natural thrust\nwedge, in the complete absence of offset of its thinner frontal part.\n\nExperiment 2 shows that an active basement strike-slip fault\naffecting an overlying preexistent thrust-wedge, must produce a\nclear offset of its thinner front, even for minor increments of strike-\nslip basal displacement (1.3 cm corresponding to 6.5 km). This offset\nvanishes rapidly toward the inner thicker parts of the wedge, affect-\ning almost exclusively the outer frontal thrusts. Comparison with\nthe natural example shows that if the GCAW is presently inactive,\nand cut by active dextral strike-slip (SWIM) faults, then unambiguous\noffset of the GCAW front has to exist, which is clearly not the case (see\nFigs. 1B, 2 and 4).\n\nExperiment 3 shows that if both the basal strike-slip fault and the\nthrust wedge are active, with alternating incremental fault slips, then\nthe resultant interference deformation pattern can be the cyclic repe-\ntition of the following three possibilities: a) true right-lateral offset of\nthe thrust wedge front (see Fig. 8A and D); b) false left-lateral offset\nof the thrust wedge front (see Fig. 8B, similar to experiment 1 see\nFig. 6C); c) no offset of the thrust wedge front (see Figs. 8C and 9).\nIt should be noted that the absence of thrust wedge offset does not\nimply an absence of basement strike-slip displacement, which quite\non the contrary is continually increasing. However, the alternation\nwith the incremental shortening that drives the successive forward\nthrust propagation cyclically erases the offset of the frontal thrust\nwedge. Differently, the resultant linear en-\u00e9chelon interference pat-\ntern tends to be increasingly well marked, including in the innermost\ndomains of the thrust wedge (compare the lineament in the Figs. 8A\nand 9). Similarly to experiment 1, the intermediate experimental\nstage in which a false left-lateral offset originates (see Fig. 8B), is\nhere interpreted as the result of a delayed propagation of the newer\nouter thrust across the strike-slip fault, which in accordance seeming-\nly behaves as a mechanical obstacle to such propagation.\n\nIn view of these results, and considering the fact that in the natural\nexample the GCAW front is not offset across any of the mapped\nSWIM faults, one of the two following tectonic scenarios is possible:\na) either the GCAW is active, and forming over a basement anisotropy\n(inactive SWIM fault?); or b) both the GCAW and the SWIM faults are\nactive. The possibility of an inactive GCAW being cut by active dextral\n\nFig. 9. Final stage of experiment 3: active basement fault and active thrust wedge (continuation).

Duarte et al. / Marine Geology 289 (2011) 135\u2013149\n\nimage of Fig.?10\n\n\nstrike-slip SWIM faults is clearly ruled out by the present experimen-\ntal results.\n\n4.1. Tectonic implications\n\nThe west Mediterranean tectonic evolution comprised the Meso-\nzoic opening of the Tethys Ocean (Fig. 10A; e.g. Maldonado et al.,\n1999; Gutscher et al., 2002; Stampfli et al., 2002; Gr\u00e0cia et al.,\n2003a; Jim\u00e9nez-Munt et al., 2010). This would account for a base-\nment tectonic anisotropy, hypothetically, either consisting in previ-\nous transform faults, or in rift-related normal faults (Fig. 10A and\nB). In view of the presented experimental results, the accretionary\nwedge (GCAW) is here interpreted to have formed on top of such\nbasement faults (present day SWIM faults) as a consequence of roll-\nback subduction beneath Gibraltar. During this period (Middle Mio-\ncene to ~1.8 Ma?, Fig. 10C to E) these faults were probably inactive,\nalthough capable of originating a linear-like perturbation in the\nGCAW surface morphology (experiment 1). At the same time, the\nmain regional convergence direction between Iberia and Africa grad-\nually suffered a counterclockwise rotation, shifting from N\u2013S\n(Fig. 10B) to near WNW\u2013ESE (Fig. 10E). Such reorientation is inter-\npreted to have triggered (since at least ~1.8 Ma) a dextral strike-slip\nreactivation of the basement (SWIM) faults (Fig. 10F), during a period\nin which the subduction driving the GCAW growth was still active\n(experiment 3), although slowing down (Gutscher et al., 2009a). It\nshould be noted that this rotation of the main convergence direction\nalso agrees with the general strain partitioning tectonic scenario pre-\nviously proposed by Terrinha et al. (2009), according to which be-\nsides dextral strike slip faulting along near E\u2013W orientated faults,\nnorthwest directed thrusts also occur along NE\u2013SW orientated tec-\ntonic structures (e.g. Horseshoe, Marqu\u00eas de Pombal and Gorringe\nFaults in Fig. 1B).\n\nOther indirect evidence supporting present simultaneous activity\nof SWIM and GCAW includes the fact that not only all known mud\nvolcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz are located on top of the accretionary\nwedge, but also the circumstance that most of the deep mud volca-\nnoes are symptomatically aligned and coincident with the SWIM\nfaults (Fig. 1A). This suggests that the fluid migration and escape\nmay be simultaneously controlled by the activity of both structures.\nIf that is in fact the case, then the mud volcanoes could be preferen-\ntially located at the intersection between the SWIM strike-slip and\nthe GCAW thrust faults, with such loci providing good pathways for\nthe fluid to ascend (Pinheiro et al., 2003, 2005; Duarte et al., 2005;\nRosas et al., 2009; Terrinha et al., 2009; Zitellini et al., 2009).\n\n5. Conclusions\n\n1. In view of the presented experimental results, the observed mor-\nphotectonic pattern of the frontal GCAW area is compatible with:\ni) The development of the GCAW on top of inactive, previously\n\nformed, basement faults (present day SWIM fault system).\nii) The simultaneously (alternating) activity of the GCAW thrust-\n\ning with the activity of the SWIM-related dextral strike-slip\nfaults.\n\nConversely, the comparison of the same experimental results with\nthe natural example unambiguously excludes the possibility of active\nstrike-slip faulting (SWIM system) affecting an inactive preexistent\nGCAW, implying that if the SWIM fault system is active then the\nGCAW must also be presently active.\n\n2. The main tectonic implications of the above conclusions comprise\nan initial (Middle Miocene to ~1.8 Ma) accretion of the GCAW\nsediments on top of preexistent Tethyan rift-related faults,\npreceding strike-slip reactivation of these faults (SWIM system),\nsimultaneously with decreasing GCAW activity (~1.8 Ma to pre-\nsent), as a function of counterclockwise rotation of the main\nIberia\u2013Nubia convergence direction.\n\n3. The modeling and morphological observations favor the interpre-\ntation of the SWIM fault system as the strike-slip reactivation of\npre-existent basement faults. This suggests that the SWIM plate\nboundary proposed by Zitellini et al. (2009) may in fact correspond\nto the local reactivation of the older Tethyan plate boundary.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was sponsored by ALMOND (Multiscale modeling of\ndeformation in the Gulf of Cadiz, PTDC/CTE-GIN/71862/2006), EURO-\nMARGINS SWIM (Earthquake and Tsunami hazards of active faults at\nthe South-West Iberian Margin: deep structure, high-resolution im-\naging and paleo-seismic signature, REN2002-11234-EMAR, 01-LEC-\nEMA09F), TOPOEUROPE/0001/2007-TOPOMED (Plate re-organization\nin the western Mediterranean: lithospheric causes and topographic\nconsequences) and NEAREST (Integrated observations from NEAR\nshore sourcES of Tsunamis: toward an early warning system, ESF Euro-\nMargins Program, contract no. 01-LEC-EMA09F and from EU Specific\nProgramme \u201cIntegrating and Strengthening the European Research\nArea\u201d, Sub-Priority 1.1.6.3, \u201cGlobal Change and Ecosystems\u201d, contract\nno. 037110) projects.

According to the scale\nmodel theory (Hubbert, 1937), proper scaling is achieved when the\nratios between model and natural prototype are independently estab-\nlished for the three fundamental units of length (?), time (?) and\nmass (?):\n\n? \u00bc\nL m\u00f0 \u00de\nL p\u00f0 \u00de\n\n;? \u00bc\nT m\u00f0 \u00de\nT p\u00f0 \u00de\n\n; ? \u00bc\nM m\u00f0 \u00de\nM p\u00f0 \u00de\n\n\u00f02\u00de\n\nwhere L=length, T=time and M=mass, and (m) stands for model\nand (p) for natural prototype. The Coulomb fracture criterion governs\n\nFig. 10.

Duarte et al. / Marine Geology 289 (2011) 135\u2013149\n\n\n\ntime independent deformation of brittle materials like sedimentary\nupper crustal rocks, since yield stress is insensitive to the rate of\ndeformation provided that the inertial forces are negligible, as in the\npresent case. This means that ? ratio is not needed for scaling in this\nsituation. Length ratio (?) was chosen given the maximum dimen-\nsions of the deformation apparatus used in the experiments (see\nSection 3), and was conveniently established as ?=2\u00d710?6. In the\npresent case, of the two relevant material properties, coefficient of\ninternal friction (?c) and cohesion (c0), the first is dimensionless,\nand approximately the same in both model and prototype, whereas\nthe second has dimension of stress and thus must be scaled accord-\ningly (Hubbert, 1937):\n\n? \u00bc\nc0 m\u00f0 \u00de\nc0 p\u00f0 \u00de\n\n\u00bc\n??\n\n?2\n\u00f03\u00de\n\nwhere ? and ? are the model/prototype ratio for stress and for accel-\neration respectively. Since inertial forces are negligible when com-\npared with gravity,\n\n? \u00bc ?g \u00bc\ng m\u00f0 \u00de\ng p\u00f0 \u00de\n\n\u00bc\n?\n\n?2\n\u00bc 1 \u00f04\u00de\n\nwhere ?g is the model/prototype gravity acceleration ratio. Thus,\nsubstituting ?=1 in Eq. (3) allows the following simplification:\n\n? \u00bc\nc0 m\u00f0 \u00de\nc0 p\u00f0 \u00de\n\n\u00bc\n?\n\n?2\n\u00bc\n\n??\n\n?3\n\u00bc ?? \u00f05\u00de\n\nwhere ? corresponds to the model/prototype density ratio. Substitut-\ning ? and ? in Eq. (5) by the respective values in Table 1, immediately\nallows the determination of the implied mass ratio=4\u00d710?18. It\nshould also be noted that since ? is generally close to one (between\n0.5 and 0.7, e.g. Withjack et al., 2007) the strength of the materials\nexpressed by ? is scaled with the length (?). Given the fact that in\nthe present case ?=2\u00d710?6 and since cohesion for upper crustal\nrocks is clearly typically less than 50 MPa, it becomes immediately ev-\nident the utility of model materials with very low cohesion (b100 Pa),\nsuch as dry quartz sand, as analogs of upper crustal rocks.\n\nReferences\n\nAbe, K., 1979.
