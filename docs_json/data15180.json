A descarga da a?gua doce proveniente\n\ndeste rio e? importante para a determinac?a?o dos padro?es hidrolo?gicos adjacentes a? sua\n\nfoz, particularmente perto das regio?es costeiras galegas. Esta a?gua doce pode inundar\n\nas Rias Baixas por per??odos prolongados, invertendo a distribuic?a?o normal de densidade.\n\nDeste modo, e? fundamental caracterizar a dina?mica da pluma do Rio Minho, assim como\n\nos padro?es termohalinos das a?reas afetadas pela sua dispersa?o.\n\nAssim, os principais objetivos deste trabalho consistiram no estudo da propagac?a?o da\n\npluma estuarina do Minho em direc?a?o a?s Rias Baixas, e na detec?a?o das condic?o?es nas\n\nquais esta afeta a circulac?a?o e as caracter??sticas hidrogra?ficas destes sistemas costeiros,\n\natrave?s do desenvolvimento e aplicac?a?o do modelo nume?rico MOHID.\n\nCom este propo?sito avaliaram-se inicialmente as caracter??sticas hidrogra?ficas das\n\nembocaduras das Rias Baixas. Verificou-se enta?o que, no caso das embocaduras norte,\n\ndevido a? sua reduzida profundidade, os fluxos de calor entre a atmosfera e o oceano\n\nsa?o o forc?amento principal que determina a temperatura da a?gua, enquanto que nas\n\nembocaduras sul os eventos de afloramento costeiro e a descarga de a?gua doce sa?o os\n\nfatores determinantes mais frequentes. Observou-se ainda um aumento de salinidade de\n\nsul para norte, o que indica que os menores valores detetados podera?o ser explicados pela\n\ndescarga de a?gua doce proveniente do Rio Minho.\n\nSeguidamente efetuou-se uma avaliac?a?o de dados de vento na costa Galega, com\n\no objetivo de verificar a sua aplicabilidade no estudo da dispersa?o da pluma estuarina\n\ndo Minho. Inicialmente compararam-se ventos medidos ao longo da costa em estac?o?es\n\nmeteorolo?gicas terrestres, com ventos medidos ao largo pelo sate?lite QuikSCAT. Esta\n\nana?lise permitiu estabelecer que os dados do sate?lite sa?o uma boa aproximac?a?o no estudo\n\nde feno?menos costeiros induzidos pelo vento. No entanto, visto que para forc?ar o modelo\n\nnume?rico MOHID sa?o necessa?rios dados de vento com grande resoluc?a?o espa?cio-temporal\n\nperto da costa, acrescentou-se ao estudo anterior dados resultantes de simulac?o?es de\n\num modelo de previsa?o (WRF). Da comparac?a?o com os dados provenientes de boias\n\noceanogra?ficas, conclui-se que a melhor base de dados para representac?a?o do vento perto\n\n\n\nxii\n\nda costa prove?m do modelo WRF.\n\nPara efetuar o estudo da influe?ncia da pluma estuarina do Minho nas Rias Baixas,\n\nfoi desenvolvido e implementado um sistema de modelac?a?o integrado de tre?s n??veis\n\nencaixados, baseado na utilizac?a?o do modelo nume?rico MOHID. O primeiro dom??nio e? um\n\nmodelo de mare? barotro?pico, englobando toda a costa da Pen??nsula Ibe?rica. O segundo\n\ne o terceiro dom??nios sa?o modelos barocl??nicos tridimensionais, sendo o segundo uma\n\nrepresentac?a?o grosseira das Rias Baixas e da costa adjacente, enquanto que o terceiro\n\ndom??nio inclui a mesma a?rea com maior resoluc?a?o. Neste a?mbito, foi tambe?m implementado\n\nem modo 2D um modelo para o estua?rio do Minho, de forma a quantificar o fluxo (e as suas\n\npropriedades) que o estua?rio injeta no oceano.\n\nDevido a? disponibilidade de dados foi escolhido o per??odo de maio de 1998 para a\n\nvalidac?a?o da implementac?a?o nume?rica desenvolvida, efetuando a simulac?a?o da propagac?a?o\n\nda pluma estuarina do Minho para este per??odo. Note-se que durante esta e?poca foi\n\ndetetada uma descarga elevada do Rio Minho, bem como ventos favora?veis a? dispersa?o da\n\npluma em direc?a?o a?s Rias Baixas. Os resultados obtidos mostraram que a metodologia de\n\nmodelos encaixados foi implementada com sucesso, uma vez que os modelos reproduzem\n\ncom precisa?o aceita?vel os padro?es hidrodina?micos e termohalinos do estua?rio do Minho\n\ne das Rias Baixas. Tambe?m foi avaliada a importa?ncia da descarga do Rio Minho e do\n\nvento no evento de maio de 1998. Os resultados revelaram que uma descarga moderada\n\ne cont??nua combinada com ventos de sul e? suficiente para inverter o padra?o de circulac?a?o\n\ndas Rias Baixas, reduzindo a importa?ncia da existe?ncia de eventos espec??ficos de elevado\n\ncaudal.\n\nNo a?mbito do objetivo princial deste estudo, foram avaliadas as condic?o?es nas quais a\n\npluma estuarina do Minho afeta a circulac?a?o e hidrografia das Rias Baixas. Os resultados\n\nnume?ricos indicaram que a dispersa?o da pluma estuarina do Minho responde rapidamente\n\na?s variac?o?es do vento e a?s variac?o?es de batimetria e morfologia da linha de costa. Sem\n\nvento, a pluma expande-se para o largo, criando um bojo em frente da embocadura do\n\nrio. Sob condic?o?es de vento de norte, a pluma estende-se numa maior dimensa?o para\n\no largo. Por outro lado, sob condic?o?es de vento de sul, a pluma fica confinada junto a?\n\ncosta, chegando a?s Rias Baixas ao fim de um dia e meio. No entanto, para descargas\n\ndo Rio Minho superiores a 800 m3 s-1, a pluma estuarina do Minho inverte os padro?es\n\nde circulac?a?o das Rias Baixas. Verificou-se tambe?m que a variabilidade do vento e da\n\ndescarga do Rio Minho sa?o os fatores que mais influenciam o tamanho e forma da pluma.\n\nSob as mesmas condic?o?es analisou-se a troca de a?gua nas Rias Baixas seguindo\n\na trajeto?ria de part??culas lanc?adas perto da embocadura do estua?rio do Minho. Para\n\ndescargas do Rio Minho superiores a 2100 m3 s-1 combinadas com ventos de sul de 6\n\nm s-1 e numa escala superior a cinco dias, observou-se uma intensa troca de a?gua entre\n\nas Rias. Cerca de 20% das part??culas detetadas na Ria de Pontevedra prove?m diretamente\n\ndo Rio Minho.\n\n\n\nxiii\n\nEm suma, a aplicac?a?o do modelo desenvolvido neste trabalho contribuiu para o\n\nconhecimento da influe?ncia do Rio Minho na circulac?a?o e hidrografia das Rias Baixas,\n\nevidenciando que esta metodologia tambe?m pode ser replicada para outros sistemas\n\ncosteiros.\n\n\n\nxiv\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Minho River, situated 30 km south of the Rias Baixas is the most important freshwater\n\nsource flowing into the Western Galician Coast (NW of the Iberian Peninsula). This\n\ndischarge is important to determine the hydrological patterns adjacent to its mouth,\n\nparticularly close to the Galician coastal region. The buoyancy generated by the Minho\n\nplume can flood the Rias Baixas for long periods, reversing the normal estuarine density\n\ngradients. Thus, it becomes important to analyse its dynamics as well as the thermohaline\n\npatterns of the areas affected by the freshwater spreading.\n\nThus, the main aim of this work was to study the propagation of the Minho estuarine\n\nplume to the Rias Baixas, establishing the conditions in which this plume affects the\n\ncirculation and hydrographic features of these coastal systems, through the development\n\nand application of the numerical model MOHID.\n\nFor this purpose, the hydrographic features of the Rias Baixas mouths were studied. It\n\nwas observed that at the northern mouths, due to their shallowness, the heat fluxes between\n\nthe atmosphere and ocean are the major forcing, influencing the water temperature, while\n\nat the southern mouths the influence of the upwelling events and the Minho River discharge\n\nwere more frequent. The salinity increases from south to north, revealing that the observed\n\nlow values may be caused by the Minho River freshwater discharge.\n\nAn assessment of wind data along the Galician coast was carried out, in order to\n\nevaluate the applicability of the study to the dispersal of the Minho estuarine plume. Firstly,\n\na comparative analysis between winds obtained from land meteorological stations and\n\noffshore QuikSCAT satellite were performed. This comparison revealed that satellite data\n\nconstitute a good approach to study wind induced coastal phenomena. However, since the\n\nnumerical model MOHID requires wind data with high spatial and temporal resolution close\n\nto the coast, results of the forecasted model WRF were added to the previous study. The\n\nanalyses revealed that the WRF model data is a consistent tool to obtain representative wind\n\ndata near the coast, showing good results when comparing with in situ wind observations\n\nfrom oceanographic buoys.\n\nTo study the influence of the Minho buoyant discharge influence on the Rias Baixas, a\n\nset of three one-way nested models was developed and implemented, using the numerical\n\n\n\nxvi\n\nmodel MOHID. The first model domain is a barotropic model and includes the whole Iberian\n\nPeninsula coast. The second and third domains are baroclinic models, where the second\n\ndomain is a coarse representation of the Rias Baixas and adjacent coastal area, while the\n\nthird includes the same area with a higher resolution. A bi-dimensional model was also\n\nimplemented in the Minho estuary, in order to quantify the flow (and its properties) that the\n\nestuary injects into the ocean.\n\nThe chosen period for the Minho estuarine plume propagation validation was the spring\n\nof 1998, since a high Minho River discharge was reported, as well as favourable wind\n\npatterns to advect the estuarine plume towards the Rias Baixas, and there was field data\n\navailable to compare with the model predictions. The obtained results show that the adopted\n\nnesting methodology was successful implemented. Model predictions reproduce accurately\n\nthe hydrodynamics and thermohaline patterns on the Minho estuary and Rias Baixas. The\n\nimportance of the Minho river discharge and the wind forcing in the event of May 1998 was\n\nalso studied. The model results showed that a continuous moderate Minho River discharge\n\ncombined with southerly winds is enough to reverse the Rias Baixas circulation pattern,\n\nreducing the importance of the occurrence of specific events of high runoff values.\n\nThe conditions in which the estuarine plume Minho affects circulation and hydrography\n\nof the Rias Baixas were evaluated. The numerical results revealed that the Minho estuarine\n\nplume responds rapidly to wind variations and is also influenced by the bathymetry and\n\nmorphology of the coastline. Without wind forcing, the plume expands offshore, creating a\n\nbulge in front of the river mouth. When the wind blows southwards, the main feature is the\n\noffshore extension of the plume. Otherwise, northward wind spreads the river plume towards\n\nthe Rias Baixas. The plume is confined close to the coast, reaching the Rias Baixas after\n\n1.5 days. However, for Minho River discharges higher than 800 m3 s-1, the Minho estuarine\n\nplume reverses the circulation patterns in the Rias Baixas. It was also observed that the\n\nwind stress and Minho River discharge are the most important factors influencing the size\n\nand shape of the Minho estuarine plume.\n\nUnder the same conditions, the water exchange between Rias Baixas was analysed\n\nfollowing the trajectories particles released close to the Minho River mouth. Over 5 days,\n\nunder Minho River discharges higher than 2100 m3 s-1 combined with southerly winds of 6\n\nm s-1, an intense water exchange between Rias was observed. However, only 20% of the\n\nparticles found in Ria de Pontevedra come directly from the Minho River.\n\nIn summary, the model application developed in this study contributed to the\n\ncharacterization and understanding of the influence of the Minho River on the Rias Baixas\n\ncirculation and hydrography, highlighting that this methodology can be replicated to other\n\ncoastal systems.\n\n\n\nPublications and Communications in\nthe context of this dissertation\n\nSeveral publications in peer reviewed journals and presentations at international and\n\nnational conferences were accomplished as result of the research developed in this thesis,\n\nand used as base for several chapters of this dissertation.\n\nPapers in international scientific periodicals with referees:\n\n\u2022 Sousa M.C., Alvarez I., Vaz N. and Dias J.M.

various parameters, such as particles, dissolved matter, pollutants, nutrients,\n\nbiogeochemical and phytoplankton communities [Dortch and Whitledge, 1992; Kortzinger,\n\n2003; Warrick and Milliman, 2003; Bruland et al., 2008; Reifel et al., 2009].\n\nGenerally, river plumes are turbid and rich in nutrients, remaining near surface due to\n\ntheir buoyancy and breaking up into lenses of less saline water, stimulating phytoplankton\n\ngrowth [Lunven et al., 2005]. Some studies suggest that the areas corresponding to river\n\nplumes are preferred feeding places for zooplankton [Pearcy, 1992]. The plume dynamics\n\nis controlled by the interaction of outflow inertia [Horner-Devine et al., 2009], buoyancy\n\nforcing [Jurisa and Chant, 2012], Earth\u2019s rotation effect [Monteiro et al., 2011], wind forcing\n\n[Choi and Wilkin, 2007] and alongshore coastal current [Fong and Geyer, 2002]. All these\n\nfactors contribute to change the dynamics of river and estuarine plumes. Different plume\n\nclassifications have been carried out. Several authors established relationships relating the\n\nextension, velocity of the discharged freshwater and the depth of the river at the mouth\n\n[Garvine, 1995; Yankovsky and Chapman, 1997; Lentz and Largier, 2006].\n\nDue to their large spatial and temporal dynamics and considering the importance of the\n\ndriving factors, the development and exploitation of ocean circulation models has become an\n\nimportant tool to study the evolution of estuarine plumes. From their application, individual\n\neffects of the driving factors (e.g. river discharge, tide or wind direction) on a buoyant plume\n\nmay be evaluated under different conditions. Several numerical studies related to coastal\n\nplumes characterization have been performed worldwide [Fong and Geyer, 2002; Garc??a-\n\nBerdeal et al., 2002; Choi and Wilkin, 2007; Guo and Valle-Levinson, 2007; Otero and\n\nRuiz-Villarreal, 2008; Horner-Devine et al., 2009; Jurisa and Chant, 2012], indicating the\n\n\n\n2 Introduction\n\nutility of a numerical model to analyse their dynamics as well as the thermohaline patterns\n\nof the areas affected by its propagation. These studies have shown that downwelling\n\nfavourable wind compresses the plume towards the coast and the vertical mixing reduces\n\nthe stratification in the plume, where velocities are stronger. On the other hand, during\n\nupwelling favourable winds, the main feature is the offshore extension of the plume,\n\nincreasing the vertical stratification in the area under its influence [Otero and Ruiz-Villarreal,\n\n2008]. Moreover, the tidal effect contributes to increase the mixing processes, reducing the\n\nstratification.\n\nIn general, the magnitude of the impact of river plumes on coastal regions is\n\nproportional to the amount of river discharge [Tian et al., 1993; Dagg et al., 2004]. Extreme\n\nevents of river discharges associated to torrential rain episodes and favourable wind patterns\n\ncan flood the major coastal estuaries located north of the river for long periods, reversing\n\nthe normal estuarine density and salinity gradients.\n\nThe Rias Baixas (Figure 1.1) are located in the northern limit of the NW Africa upwelling\n\nsystem [Wooster et al., 1976] and are ecosystems of enormous potential, both economical\n\n(e.g. exploration of marine resources: fisheries, aquaculture and fishing industry) and social\n\n(e.g. tourism: beaches and natural beauty), leading to a wide population establishment in\n\nthis area. Thus, the quality of its inhabitant\u2019s life depends on the conservation of the natural\n\necosystems and mitigation of the negative impacts of anthropogenic activities. They are\n\nalso situated along one of the most important maritime routes and numerous merchant\n\nships navigate through its waters and even close to the coast. The frequent storms which\n\naffect the coast during winter time can provoke accidents with important consequences\n\nas oil spills. These spills may seriously affect the local economy, which depends on\n\nthe richness of marine ecosystems (bivalves, octopus, sardine, sole and barnacle). The\n\nseasonal coastal upwelling induced by favourable winds in spring-summer months is the\n\nmain recognized source of primary production, supporting the high fishery and aquaculture\n\nyields. Nowadays, the number of suspended rafts in the Rias Baixas is 3237, with an\n\nestimated annual mussel production per raft of 75\u00d7103 kg raft-1 y-1 (around 15% of the world\nproduction), rendering a total estimated production of 243\u00d7106 kg y-1 of edible mussels,\nrepresenting enough biomass to have clear impact on the Rias as an entire ecosystem\n\n[Alonso-Perez et al., 2010].\n\nThe primary production generated by the upwelling events can also be affected by the\n\nestuarine discharge that flow in the interior of the Rias and continental shelf. The freshwater\n\ndischarge from the rivers is particularly important in near coastal regions. The Rias Baixas\n\nhave numerous rivers flowing inside, modifying their thermohaline properties. The Minho\n\nRiver, situated south of the Rias Baixas (Figure 1.1), is the most important river that flows\n\ninto the Western Galician coast. The Minho estuarine plume intrusion can generate an\n\nimportant salinity decrease at the Rias Baixas mouths, reversing the normal circulation\n\npattern and affecting the primary production distribution [deCastro et al., 2006a]. This\n\n\n\n1.1 Motivation 3\n\nFigure 1.1: Location and bathymetry of study area.\n\nreverse circulation pattern is characterized by the intrusion of warm and less saline coastal\n\nwaters at the surface, which accumulates in the Rias interior and finally flows towards\n\nthe ocean through the bottom. The Minho freshwater intrusion can rise both positive and\n\nnegative effects. It can generate an inverse estuarine circulation, which tends to stop water\n\nexchange between the Rias and the shelf, increasing residence time and hence affecting\n\nwater quality. Conversely, extreme freshwater pulses can induce phytoplankton blooms at\n\nthe shelf, which penetrates into the Rias embedded in a water fresher than the estuarine\n\none, fertilizing the area. Consequently, knowledge of freshwater effects in these areas\n\ngreatly facilitates the management of many exploited and protected species. Due to the lack\n\nof continuous and simultaneous in situ measurements along coastal estuaries as the Rias\n\nBaixas, it is important to develop numerical models to understand the complex structure\n\nof the oceanographic features and circulation patterns that characterize these particular\n\nenvironments.\n\nThe numerical models are used worldwide, in order to quantify and understand\n\ndifferent process occurring in coastal waters. They have the ability to answer questions\n\nand investigate hypothetical scenarios (e.g. changes in wind and river discharge), which\n\nobservations alone cannot provide. In addition, they afford the capability to study processes\n\n\n\n4 Introduction\n\nindependently. The Minho estuarine plume influence inside the western Galician estuaries\n\nhas not been studied in detail, namely by means of numerical model applications,\n\nspecifically designed for this purpose. Therefore, this study aims the implementation of a\n\nhigh resolution circulation and transport model, in order to study the influence of the Minho\n\nbuoyant discharge influence upon Rias Baixas.\n\n1.2 Aims\n\nThe main goal of this work is to study the evolution of the Minho estuarine plume and its\n\neffect on the circulation and hydrography of the Rias Baixas, as well as the dependence\n\nof the estuarine plume impact on these coastal systems in terms of its major forcing\n\nmechanisms. In particular, this work aims to:\n\n\u2022 compare surface winds from weather forecast model, satellite and in situ\n\nmeasurements along the Galician coast, in order to evaluate its applicability to study\n\nwind induced coastal phenomena;\n\n\u2022 characterize the hydrography and dynamics of the NW Iberian Peninsula, with special\n\nemphasis to the Rias Baixas adjacent area;\n\n\u2022 develop a high resolution numerical model application to reproduce the propagation of\n\nthe Minho estuarine plume towards the Rias Baixas;\n\n\u2022 study specific events of the Minho estuarine plume intrusion inside the Rias Baixas;\n\n\u2022 analyse the dynamics of the Minho estuarine plume in terms of the major forcing (tides,\n\nriver discharge and wind conditions);\n\n\u2022 investigate the necessary conditions for the establishment of the reverse circulation in\n\nthe Rias Baixas;\n\n\u2022 assess the water renovation and mixture between Rias Baixas through the analysis of\n\nthe trajectories of passive particles released at the Minho River mouth;\n\nThe approach used to achieve the specific aims listed above involves the implementation of\n\na three-dimensional baroclinic model and in situ and remote sensing data analysis, allowing\n\nto research the evolution of the Minho estuarine plume along the NW Iberian Peninsula, and\n\nespecially its influence in the Rias Baixas dynamics.\n\n\n\n1.3 Literature review 5\n\n1.3 Literature review\n\n1.3.1 Estuarine plumes\n\nRivers often discharge in the coastal zone in the form of plumes and are essential for\n\nthe exportation of fine sediments, nutrients and organic material from land to the coastal\n\nocean. They can directly influence coastal sediment budgets, ocean biogeochemistry\n\nand circulation in coastal waters [Garvine, 1984; Kourafalou, 1999]. The estuarine plume\n\nstructure may take a variety of shapes, depending on the complex interactions with the\n\nambient flow, tides, bottom topography, freshwater volume discharged, the shape of the\n\nriver mouth and wind stress [Garvine, 1974; Yankovsky and Chapman, 1997; Fong and\n\nGeyer, 2002; Garc??a-Berdeal et al., 2002].\n\nSince the 1950s, various studies including observational, laboratory and numerical\n\nmodel studies have been adopted to understand the dynamics and structures of estuarine\n\nplumes. The first steady state theory of a river plume entering the sea off a straight coast\n\nwere presented by Takano [1954a,b, 1955]. From 1960s to 1980s, observational studies\n\nof several plume dynamics had been made around the world: for example the Columbia\n\nRiver estuary (USA) [Stefansson and Richards, 1963; Park, 1966], Connecticut Estuary\n\n(USA)[Garvine, 1974], Fraser River (Canada) [Royer and Emery, 1982], Rhine River estuary\n\n(Netherlands) [van Alphen et al., 1988] and the Rhone River estuary (France) [Szekielda and\n\nKupferman, 1973].\n\nChao [1988a,b] and Chao and Boicourt [1986] were the first authors to apply an ocean\n\nmodel with idealized topography, to examine the effect of wind and river discharge on\n\nbuoyant plumes. Latter, Garvine [1995] introduced a classification scheme for unforced\n\nplumes to assess the contribution of advection terms and the Coriolis force to the buoyant\n\nplume. A different classification scheme was suggested by Yankovsky and Chapman\n\n[1997], using the plume\u2019s vertical structure and discriminating between bottom and surface\n\nadvected plumes. In spite of the absence of external forcing mechanisms in their theory, they\n\ncorrectly predicted the plume type for several numerical and real cases. In the mid-1990s\n\nand in the early 2000s, the dependence of three-dimensional plume characteristics on\n\nmodel parameters were investigated by Garvine [1999, 2001], Kourafalou et al. [1996] and\n\nKourafalou [1999]. To study the impact of upwelling winds to the surface advected plume,\n\na conceptual model was developed by Fong and Geyer [2001]. Their model simulations\n\ndemonstrated that the plume thins and is advected offshore by the cross-shore Ekman\n\ntransport. Garc??a-Berdeal et al. [2002] and Choi and Wilkin [2007] also used numerical\n\nsimulations to study the influence of wind stress and ambient flow in a high discharge river\n\nplume. These studies showed that the wind speed and direction play an important role\n\nin determining plume structure and the fate of freshwater, as demonstrated by Hetland\n\n\n\n6 Introduction\n\n[2005]. That is, downwelling favourable wind compresses the plume towards the coast,\n\nincreasing the mixing process and inducing the coastal current formation, while upwelling\n\nfavourable wind induces an offshore advection on the surface Ekman layer. The results also\n\nshowed that the river runoff is one of the most important environmental factors leading to\n\nthe seaward expansion of the plume.\n\nA modulation effect was attributed to the tidal action, which contributes to mixing\n\nprocesses, reducing stratification generated by the wind and spreading the freshwater over\n\nthe shelf [Chao, 1990; Garvine, 1999; Guo and Valle-Levinson, 2007; Marques et al., 2009].\n\nThis was further confirmed with laboratory experiments by Horner-Devine et al. [2006,\n\n2009]. Therefore, it is of great significance to have a comprehensive understanding of the\n\nplume shaping in relationship with the river discharge, wind and ambient current.\n\n1.3.2 Western Galician coast\n\n1.3.2.1 Hydrodynamical and hydrographical patterns\n\nDuring the last few years the Western Galician coast has been extensively studied taking\n\ninto account its hydrodynamical and hydrographical patterns. This area has an important\n\nhydrologic and biogeochemical activity, mainly attributable to coastal upwelling processes\n\nwhich occur from April to October [McClain et al., 1986; Tilstone et al., 1994]. This upwelling\n\nis commonly attributed to the action of northerly winds along the shelf which produce an\n\noffshore Ekman transport, displacing surface water seaward.\n\nThe Rias Baixas have been extensively studied by means of in situ measurements and\n\nby numerical models. Prego and Fraga [1992] analysed scattered measurements at the Ria\n\nde Vigo from February to October 1986, by means of stationary box model. It was observed\n\nthat the Ria de Vigo behaves as a partially mixed estuary with residual positive circulation.\n\nAn interannual study to describe thermohaline and biogechemical properties of the Ria de\n\nVigo from May 1994 to September 1995 was carried out by Doval et al. [1998], showing\n\nthe Ria also behaves like an extension of the shelf during the upwelling season and like a\n\npartially mixed estuary during the downwelling season. More recently, Alvarez et al. [2013]\n\nanalysed the response of thermohaline properties to the occurrence of upwelling events\n\nat the Ria de Vigo from October 2003 to September 2004. Eastern North Atlantic Central\n\nWater (ENACW) was observed during spring-summer (summer) at the southern (northern)\n\nmouth of Ria de Vigo.\n\ndeCastro et al. [2000] performed hydrodynamical and thermohaline measurements at\n\nthe Ria de Pontevedra from February to July 1998, through nine stations spreaded along\n\nthe Ria, and an anchored station located in the inner-middle part of the Ria. These\n\nmeasurements were used to identify the current patterns. It was observed that the wind\n\n\n\n1.3 Literature review 7\n\ndirection is strongly dependent on topography and that wind velocity higher than 4 m\n\ns-1 dominate the current at surface layers, even against tidal effect. Prego et al. [2001]\n\nassessed the physical-hydrodynamical characteristics of the Ria de Pontevedra, studying\n\nits hydrography and spring upwelling events during a year. Four distinct water bodies\n\npenetrating inside the Ria during the course of a year were observed: (1) autumnal shelf\n\nwater, (2) seawater showing characteristics of the poleward current in winter, (3) subsurface\n\nshelf water in May to September when the upwelling relaxes and (4) the ENACW in summer.\n\nIn the same period, an unusual two-layered tidal circulation pattern in this Ria was also\n\nstudied in terms of thermohaline stratification and wind forcing by Gomez-Gesteira et al.\n\n[2001]. This unusual positive tidal circulation showed dependency on the particular summer\n\nstratification conditions and on the presence of easterly winds inside the estuary. The\n\nstratification was generated by solar heating and favourable upwelling conditions on the\n\nadjacent shelf, which reinforced the estuarine positive circulation and originates near bed\n\ninflow of ENACW. The unusual winter upwelling event observed in the Ria de Pontevedra,\n\nduring a cruise carried out on the 27 January 1998, corresponds to the water mass\n\ntransported by the poleward current, which is saltier and warmer, though less dense water\n\nthan the ENACW observed in spring and summer [Alvarez et al., 2003]. deCastro et al.\n\n[2004] studied the along estuary negative circulation in the Ria de Pontevedra, revealing\n\na two-layered circulation pattern generated by the existence of two different water masses\n\nat intermediate depths. This pattern was due to a sudden transition between upwelling\n\nand downwelling combined with a fast decrease of river discharge. This negative estuarine\n\ncirculation was also described in Ria de Arousa [Alvarez-Salgado et al., 1996a,b], which is\n\n30 km North of Ria de Pontevedra. Moreover, deCastro et al. [2006b] analysed the seasonal\n\nevolution of the spatial thermohaline asymmetry. This asymmetry varies throughout the\n\nyear depending on two external parameters: the river discharge and the seawater inflow\n\n(characterized by upwelling index).\n\nThe Rias de Vigo, Pontevedra and Arousa were studied in simultaneous by Alvarez\n\net al. [2005a], through the analysis of inter and intra-annual evolution of water temperature\n\nand salinity (between October 1997 and October 2002) in the boundary between the Rias\n\nand the adjacent ocean. All Rias were observed to share some common features: thermal\n\ninversion from November to February, intense upwelling events from April to September.\n\nThe Rias de Vigo and Pontevedra behave in a similar way, even quantitatively, and they\n\ndiffer slightly from the Ria de Arousa. This difference is especially important at the northern\n\nmouth of Arousa, where water is fresher in winter and upwelling events are less frequent\n\nduring the summer. The water exchange between the Ria de Pontevedra and the shelf,\n\nunder tidal effects, wind and freshwater input was studied during the past few years, while\n\nin the other Rias fewer studies were performed on this subject.\n\nThe first studies carried out off the Rias Baixas were performed by Wooster et al.\n\n[1976]. They analysed the seasonal upwelling cycle along the eastern boundary of the\n\n\n\n8 Introduction\n\nNorth Atlantic from 1850 to 1970. It was found that this system is the northernmost limit\n\nof the Eastern North Atlantic upwelling system, which extends from 10\u00b0 N to about 44\u00b0\n\nN. Fraga [1981] was also among the first to describe the upwelling off Galician coast,\n\nusing scattered measurements obtained from 1974 to 1977. Tenore et al. [1982] studied\n\nthe benthic distribution on the continental shelf in order to describe the coastal upwelling\n\noffshore. McClain et al. [1986] analysed the wind driven upwelling using a grid of stations\n\ncovering the continental shelf from Cape Finisterre to Vigo during April 1982. They observed\n\na salinity increase and a water temperature decrease during the upwelling season. Alvarez-\n\nSalgado et al. [1993] studied the hydrographic variability off the Rias Baixas during the\n\nupwelling season (May-October 1989) by means of samples taken at a station located\n\non the shelf, about 9 km from the mouth of the Ria de Pontevedra. They observed that\n\nthe upwelling events occur with biweekly periodicity, bringing Eastern North Atlantic Water\n\n(ENAW) to the subsurface layer at the station. The observations show that the thermohaline\n\nproperties of the upwelled water tend to increase over time. Perez et al. [1995] studied\n\nthe correlation between inter-annual variations in wind stress and changes in ENACW by\n\nmeans of the combination of data obtained from the eastern North Atlantic region from\n\n1974 to 1992 and data obtained near the Iberian coast (around 42\u00b0 N, 10\u00b0 W) in 1991\n\nand 1993. Fiuza et al. [1998] analysed water masses and their circulation in the eastern\n\nNorth Atlantic region based on CTD measurements in May 1993. They concluded that this\n\nepisodically circulation is enhanced, especially from April to October, by coastal upwelling\n\nevents induced by northerly shelf winds, during which cold and nutrient-laden ENACW\n\nascends to the shelf and eventually enters the Rias. Torres et al. [2003] used sea surface\n\ntemperature (SST) to describe the Galician upwelling region from July 1999 to May 2001,\n\nalthough they covered a larger area and their study was mainly focused on wind patterns.\n\nThey verified that the wind measured at Finisterre itself, is not always representative of the\n\noverall wind field.\n\nAlvarez et al. [2005b] also studied the variation in upwelling intensity along the\n\nnorthwest Iberian Peninsula. They observed that the intensity of coastal upwelling is strongly\n\ndependent on the wind pattern. The maximum amplitudes of wind stress were observed at\n\nthe western coast (0.30 N m-2) with southward direction and these are shown to be related\n\nto low water temperature (12 \u00b0C) and high salinity (35.8) in the estuary mouth. In order to\n\ndescribe the Ekman transport patterns in the area close to the Galician coast, Cabanas and\n\nAlvarez [2005] analysed a 40-year time series of daily and monthly Ekman transport. The\n\nEkman transport shows different seasonal patterns: the summer pattern is characterized\n\nby seaward transport (upwelling favourable), while the winter pattern is characterized by\n\nlandward transport (downwelling favourable).\n\nAlvarez et al. [2008a] described the wind forcing over the area extending from 36\u00b0\n\nN to 44\u00b0 N by means of two different but complementary databases: QuikSCAT satellite\n\ndatabase was used for the period between 2000-2006 with high spatial resolution (0.25\u00b0\u00d7\n\n\n\n1.3 Literature review 9\n\n0.25\u00b0) and Pacific Fisheries Environmental Laboratory (PFEL) database provided longer\n\nrecords (from 1967-2006) with a coarser spatial resolution (1\u00b0\u00d7 1\u00b0). They found that the\nupwelling events occur along the full western coast of the Iberian Peninsula, although these\n\nare definitively more complex on particular coastal features, due to the interaction between\n\nthe macroscopic wind regime and coastal orography. More recently, Santos et al. [2012]\n\nstudied the differences in the variability of water temperature along the western Iberian\n\nPeninsula. The difference between coastal and ocean values was related to the generation\n\nof coastal upwelling, which partially inhibits the warming from surface of coastal waters.\n\n1.3.2.2 Minho River\n\nThe Minho River, situated south of Rias Baixas, is the most important river flowing into the\n\nWestern Galician coast. The discharge of freshwater is particularly important in near coastal\n\nregions. Freshwater can flood the major coastal estuaries located north of the river for\n\nprolonged periods, reversing the normal estuarine density and salinity gradients [Fiedler and\n\nLaurs, 1990]. Because the freshwater intrusion can occur in these estuaries, its presence\n\nor absence can provide an important environmental distinction between estuaries as well\n\nas between near coastal regions. This river is also one of the most important contributing to\n\nthe formation of an extensive buoyant plume known as the Western Iberian Buoyant Plume\n\n(WIBP)[Peliz et al., 2002; Otero et al., 2008, 2013].\n\nThe influence of the Minho estuarine plume along the western Galician coast has never\n\nbeen studied in detail. There are previous works which have been carried out analysing\n\nchanges in thermohaline variables: Mourino and Fraga [1982] analysed variations in water\n\ntemperature, salinity, nitrate, nitrite and silicate at the southern mouth of the Ria de Vigo from\n\nOctober 1976 to December 1977. They found an important salinity decrease in the estuary\n\nmouth from December to March that they attributed to the Minho River freshwater. More\n\nrecently, the effect of the Minho River intrusion in the hydrographic behaviour of the Rias\n\nBaixas was assessed by Alvarez et al. [2006] using thermohaline observations. This study\n\nwas carried out in the spring of 1998 under high Minho River discharge and favourable wind\n\npatterns, which spread the estuarine plume northward from the river mouth. The generated\n\nbuoyancy reverses the normal salinity gradient in the Rias of Vigo and Pontevedra, but\n\nnot in Ria de Arousa. deCastro et al. [2006a] also observed an intrusion of low salinity\n\nwater coming from the Minho River for the same period, which can be related to the high\n\ndischarge from the dams that control the Minho River discharge. This release resulted in\n\na strong cross-axis salinity gradient, in which salinity decreases seawards, giving rise to a\n\ntwo-layered circulation pattern and a high concentration of the phytoplankton Skeletonema\n\ncostatum.\n\n\n\n10 Introduction\n\n1.3.2.3 Numerical modelling\n\nSeveral developments and applications of numerical models have been made in the last\n\ndecades to investigate the interaction between the Rias Baixas and their adjacent coastal\n\nwaters.\n\nPascual [1987a,b] studied the circulation produced by tides and wind in the Ria de\n\nArousa with a 2D finite difference model. Bermudez et al. [1997, 1996] studied the\n\ncirculation inside the Ria de Vigo driven by tides using also a 2D model but based on\n\nfinite elements. Some studies have been done to quantify the long term processes and\n\nthe seasonal variations inside the Rias, by means of a box model [Prego and Fraga, 1992;\n\nNogueira et al., 1997b] or using data from a fixed station [Nogueira et al., 1997a]. The results\n\nwere used to describe the dynamics of the system, the seasonal patterns and the long term\n\ntrends. On the other hand, some authors [Montero et al., 1992, 1997] used lagrangian\n\nmodels coupled with 2D eulerian models to carry out dispersion studies in Galician Rias.\n\nTaboada et al. [1998] developed a 3D baroclinic model to study the seasonal variations of\n\nthe Ria de Vigo residual circulation. This circulation model was compared to and found to be\n\nin reasonable agreement with the box model [Prego and Fraga, 1992]. The results showed\n\nthat the Ria de Vigo has a two-layered circulation, where most of water enters the estuary\n\nthrough the southern mouth and leaves it through the northern one. Gomez-Gesteira et al.\n\n[1999] used the model of Taboada et al. [1998] in a 2D mode to track the dispersion of\n\npassive pollutants in the Ria de Vigo, concluding that the Ria de Vigo has a small residence\n\ntime. Some modelling efforts have evaluated residual fluxes in Ria de Vigo and indicate a\n\ntwo-layered pattern [Montero et al., 1999; Torres-Lo?pez et al., 2001; Souto et al., 2003].\n\nOnly few studies have dealt with the hydrodynamics modelling of the Ria de Pontevedra.\n\nRuiz-Villarreal et al. [2002] applied a numerical model to understand the hydrodynamics\n\nand its influence on nutrients cycles and on the productivity in the Ria. This Ria was found\n\nto be a partially mixed estuary with a double-layered residual pattern, with water flowing\n\nseaward at the surface layers and upstream at the bottom layers. The combination of these\n\ncharacteristics has an important effect in biogeochemical cycles and productivity in the\n\nestuary. Gomez-Gesteira et al. [2003] used numerical modelling to relate the residence\n\ntime estimated by a stationary box model to the upwelling index and river discharge\n\nconsidering biweekly surveys in the Ria de Pontevedra. The calculated residence time\n\nvaries from around 3 days at upstream region to around 8 days near the mouth and it\n\ndepends simultaneously on the river discharge and seawater inflow. More recently, Gilcoto\n\net al. [2007] developed a 3D kinematic box model based on tracer and volume balances.\n\nHowever, through the analysis of the model results the existence of a bidirectional flow\n\noriginated by a barotropic interaction with the shelf upwelling was found.\n\nRecently, Otero et al. [2008, 2013] also used a numerical model for study the variability\n\nof the Western Iberian Buoyant Plume in response to wind events in the adjacent shelf of\n\n\n\n1.4 Structure of this work 11\n\nRias Baixas, identifying three characteristic situations: a) confinement of the plume to the\n\ncoast during downwelling-southerly-winds, b) expansion of the plume during the declining\n\nphase of the downwelling event by relaxation of the wind and c) expansion of the plume by\n\nupwelling-northerly-winds.\n\nAll these studies provide insight on the dynamics of the adjacent coast of the Rias\n\nBaixas. In this work, in order to give a step forward, a high resolution numerical model\n\nwas implemented for this region. This was performed to study the propagation of the Minho\n\nestuarine plume to the Rias Baixas, establishing the conditions in which this plume affects\n\nthe circulation and hydrographic features of the Rias Baixas.\n\n1.4 Structure of this work\n\nThis dissertation is divided in 7 chapters. Chapter 1 presents the Introduction, where the\n\nmotivations, general objectives, a general literature review and the structure of the work are\n\ndescribed. This is followed by Chapter 2, where a review of the hydrography and dynamics\n\ncharacterization of the NW of the Iberian Peninsula, with special attention to the Rias Baixas\n\nadjacent area is performed. In Chapter 2, the hydrography of the Ria de Vigo, Ria de\n\nPontevedra and Ria de Arousa mouth is studied in terms of its major mechanisms and\n\nidentifying their influence on the establishment of the observed patterns. In Chapter 3 an\n\nassessment of wind patterns accuracy from the QuikSCAT satellite, WRF model and in situ\n\nwind along the Galician coast is carried out, allowing to evaluate its applicability to study\n\nwind induced coastal phenomena. Chapter 4 presents the general overview of MOHID\n\nnumerical model as well as the setup of the coastal and estuarine models. The model\n\nability to reproduce the Minho estuarine plume, as well as the study of the propagation\n\nand influence of Minho estuarine plume on Rias Baixas circulation and hydrography can be\n\nfound in Chapters 5 and 6. Finally, in Chapter 7, the conclusions of the dissertation are\n\ndrawn and suggestions for further work are presented.\n\n\n\n12 Introduction\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nCharacterization of the Minho River,\nRias Baixas and adjacent coastal\nzone\n\n2.1 Introduction\n\nCirculation and exchange processes in estuaries are forced by waves, tides, freshwater\n\ninflow, wind stress and exchanges with the atmosphere. These processes determine the\n\npatterns found for the salinity and water temperature inside estuaries, which are perhaps\n\nthe most important physical factors confronting an organism here.\n\nThe northwest of the Iberian Peninsula is characterized by the presence of four\n\nestuaries located south of Cape Finisterre locally named as Rias Baixas (Figure 2.1),\n\nwhich are similar from a morphological point of view and sharing several common features\n\n[Alvarez et al., 2005a]. They are located in the northernmost limit of the Eastern North\n\nUpwelling System, which extends from 10\u00b0N to about 44\u00b0N [Wooster et al., 1976], and\n\ntherefore in an area where the along-shore winds interact with the coastal topography to\n\ngenerate upwelling-downwelling dynamics on the continental shelf. The seasonal coastal\n\nupwelling induced by favorable winds in spring-summer months is the main recognized\n\nsource of primary production related to the presence of ENACW near coast and inside\n\nthese estuaries [Rios et al., 1992b; Perez et al., 1995; Fiuza et al., 1998]. Although this\n\ncoastal upwelling is basically a spring-summer process linked to northeast winds, several\n\nautumn-winter upwelling events have been characterized along the Galician coast [Alvarez\n\net al., 2003; deCastro et al., 2006c; Prego et al., 2007; deCastro et al., 2008; Varela et al.,\n\n2008, 2010; Alvarez et al., 2009], indicating that the upwelling process along the Galician\n\ncoast cannot be considered a limited phenomenon to the spring-summer seasons and that\n\n\n\n14 Characterization of the Minho River, Rias Baixas and adjacent coastal zone\n\nFigure 2.1: Map of the Western Galician Coast.\n\nshould be observed under favourable conditions independently of the season. Due to the\n\nproximity with the Minho River, the Rias Baixas considered in this thesis are from south to\n\nnorth: the Ria de Vigo, the Ria de Pontevedra and the Ria de Arousa.\n\nIn this chapter, a review of the hydrography and dynamics characterization of the NW\n\nof the Iberian Peninsula, with special attention to the Rias Baixas adjacent area is carried\n\nout, based on published papers and data collected from surveys. It is intended, therefore\n\nto understand and evaluate the importance of the physical processes in the study area.\n\nThus, this chapter is structured as follows. First, general atmospheric, topographic and\n\nhydrographic features of the Minho River and Rias Baixas are briefly presented. This\n\nis followed by an overview of the additional aspects to the water masses and circulation\n\npatterns in the Rias Baixas adjacent area. Next, the hydrography of the Ria de Vigo, Ria\n\nde Pontevedra and Ria de Arousa mouth is studied, in terms of its major mechanisms,\n\nidentifying their influence on the establishment of the observed patterns. Finally, the main\n\nconclusions from the work are discussed.\n\n\n\n2.2 General description 15\n\n2.2 General description\n\nThe Rias Baixas between 42\u00b0N and 43\u00b0N are characterized by a fairly topography and a\n\njagged SSE-NNW coastline. They are V shaped widening progressively from the innermost\n\npart of the estuary toward the mouth, with volume comprised between 3.0 and 4.3 km3.\n\nThey are connected to the open sea by means of two entrances due to the existence of\n\nislands in the outermost part. Freshwater contributions come from four small rivers: the\n\nVerdugo-Oitabe?n River at the Ria de Vigo head, the Le?rez River at the Ria de Pontevedra\n\nand the Umia e Ulla Rivers at the Ria de Arousa (Figure 2.1). The Table 2.1 shows the main\n\nfundamental dimensions of Rias Baixas.\n\nThe Ria de Vigo supports the highest population among the Rias. The Ria de Arousa\n\nis the one with higher surface, while the Ria de Pontevedra is the second largest estuary of\n\nthe Rias Baixas in terms of water volume content. The volume of freshwater flowing into the\n\nRias is higher in Ria de Arousa, because two main rivers discharge into this estuary. It is\n\nthe shallowest of the Rias.\n\nThe Rias Baixas are characterized by an oceanic climate, which tends to aridity in\n\nsummer. The climate of the area can be related to the seasonal evolution of two major\n\natmospheric systems the Azores High and the Iceland Low [Wooster et al., 1976; Fiuza\n\net al., 1982; Vitorino et al., 2002]. Typically, during the summer months, when the Azores\n\nhigh-pressure cell is located over the central North Atlantic, the associated trade wind blows\n\nsouthward along the coast of Iberia inducing upwelling and associated southward currents.\n\nThe summer wave regime is characterized by low energy wave conditions, with significant\n\nwave heights of 2 m and period of about 8-9 s [Vitorino et al., 2002; Dodet et al., 2010].\n\nDuring the winter, the Azores High is usually located farther south of the North West Africa\n\nand the Iceland low pressure is deeper and located in southeastern Greenland. Thus, the\n\npressure gradient between the two systems results in an onshore and slightly northward\n\nwind along the west coast of the Iberian Peninsula. During the winter months, the significant\n\nwave heights are of the order of about 3-4 m, with a period of 11 and 13 s [Dodet et al., 2010].\n\nTable 2.1: Rias Baixas dimensions.\nRia de Vigo Ria de Pontevedra Ria de Arousa\n\nLocation 42\u00b0 06\u2019 - 42\u00b0 21\u2019N\n8\u00b0 36\u2019 - 8\u00b0 54\u2019W\n\n42\u00b0 15\u2019 - 42\u00b0 25\u2019N\n8\u00b0 39\u2019 - 8\u00b0 56\u2019W\n\n42\u00b0 27\u2019 - 42\u00b0 41\u2019N\n8\u00b0 44\u2019 - 9\u00b0 01\u2019W\n\nSurface (km2) 156 141 239\nVolume (km3) 3.12 3.47 4.34\n\nMean width (km) 4.80 3.80 9.00\nMean depth (m) 21 31 19\n\nMain axis length (km) 32.50 22.00 33.00\n\nMouth width (km)\nsouthern: 5.10 southern: 7.30 southern: 4.60\nnorthern: 2.80 northern: 3.60 northern: 3.70\n\nMouth depth (m)\nsouthern: 45 southern: 60 southern: 55\nnorthern: 25 northern: 15 northern: 5\n\n\n\n16 Characterization of the Minho River, Rias Baixas and adjacent coastal zone\n\n2.2.1 Rias Baixas\n\n2.2.1.1 Ria de Vigo\n\nAround 30 km northwards of the Minho River mouth is located the Ria de Vigo (Figure 2.2),\n\nwhich is the most meridional of the Rias Baixas. It is located near the border between\n\nPortugal and Spain, between 42\u00b0 06\u2019N and 42\u00b0 21\u2019N, and 8\u00b0 36\u2019W and 8\u00b0 54\u2019W.\n\nThe Ria de Vigo is 32.5 km long, presenting an NE-SW direction, with 1 km width in\n\nits inner part (NE) and 10 km at the mouth of the Ria (SW). The mean width and depth are\n\n4.8 km and 21 m, respectively. The connection of the Ria with the shelf is separated by the\n\nC??es Islands, forming two distinct estuary mouths. The northern mouth is 2.8 km wide and\n\nhas a maximum depth of 25 m and the southern mouth is 5.1 km wide and 45 m depth.\n\nIt can be divided into three zones according to the degree of continental or oceanic\n\ninfluence. The innermost zone includes San Simo?n bay and shows the characteristics of\n\na typical estuary, due to the effects of tides (? 3 m of averaged tidal range) and to the\ninfluence of the Verdugo-Oitabe?n River [Perez et al., 1992]. This River is the main tributary\n\nof freshwater into Ria de Vigo with a catchment area of 333 km2. The Verdugo-Oitabe?n\n\nRiver has a annual mean discharge of 13 m3 s-1, with a greatest seasonal variability, with\n\nvalues ranging from 120 m3 s-1 in winter to values of 1 m3 s-1 in summer [Rios et al., 1992a].\n\nThe middle zone, which spreads from the Rande Strait to Mar Cape, is under the influence of\n\nboth continental and oceanic contributions. Finally, the outer zone, which is under dominant\n\noceanic influence, includes the area lying between Mar Cape and the C??es islands, providing\n\na natural protection from Atlantic swell. The almost north-south orientation of these islands\n\nleaves two relatively narrow corridors at the north and south entrances of the Ria.\n\nThe tidal forcing is mainly semidiurnal with a Form Number significantly lower than\n\n0.25 [Varela et al., 2005]. The tidal range varies between 2 and 4 m, so this Ria is a\n\nFigure 2.2: Map of the Ria de Vigo.\n\n\n\n2.2 General description 17\n\nmesotidal estuary [Fraga and Margalef, 1979]. The Ria de Vigo behaves as partially mixed\n\nestuary, with positive residual circulation and a two layer circulation pattern, with surface\n\nwater outflow and inflow on the bottom [Fraga and Margalef, 1979; Prego and Fraga, 1992].\n\n2.2.1.2 Ria de Pontevedra\n\nThe Ria de Pontevedra is located between 42\u00b0 15\u2019N and 42\u00b0 25\u2019N, and 8\u00b0 39\u2019W and 8\u00b0 56\u2019W.\n\nIt is connected to the ocean by means of two mouths (Figure 2.3). The northern mouth is\n\nnarrow (3.6 km) and shallow (15 m), while the southern mouth is wide (7.3 km) and has a\n\ndepth of 60 m. The southern mouth provides the main channel for water exchange and the\n\nOns and Onza islands behave as protective barriers against the swell from the open sea.\n\nIt is the second largest estuary of the Rias Baixas in terms of water volume content\n\n(3.47 km3) and has a mean depth of 31 m and a surface of 141 km2 This Ria is oriented\n\nin the SW-NE direction, with the Le?rez River being in the innermost part of the Ria and the\n\nOnza and Ons islands in the outermost part of the estuary. This river is the main freshwater\n\nrunoff that flows into the estuary. This river has a catchment area of 450 km2 and an annual\n\nmean discharge of 27.5 m3 s-1. The monthly mean discharge oscillates between 2 and 80\n\nm3 s-1 and follows a similar pattern to the rainfall, as its runoff is not controlled by dams.\n\nIn this way, the level of the discharge is high from December to March, with a maximum\n\ndischarge in February and a low discharge from July to September and a minimum in\n\nSeptember. The Ria may be considered as an extension of the river Le?rez valley where\n\nthere is tidal influence [Ruiz-Villarreal et al., 2002].\n\nThe Ria de Pontevedra is an estuarine-like system that has a semi-diurnal and\n\nmesotidal regime, which is characterized by a two-layered residual circulation pattern [Prego\n\net al., 2001]. Typical spring vertical profiles of density show a pycnocline at depths that are\n\nclose to ?10 m with density anomaly values around 27 kg m3 near the riverbed and lower\ndensity values near the surface due to the Lerez River influence. The surface density values\n\nFigure 2.3: Map of the Ria de Pontevedra.\n\n\n\n18 Characterization of the Minho River, Rias Baixas and adjacent coastal zone\n\nrange from around 21 kg m3 at the inner part of the estuary to around 24 kg m3 at the outer\n\none. The partial stratification of the estuary is maintained by salinity in winter and water\n\ntemperature in summer [Gomez-Gesteira et al., 2001].\n\n2.2.1.3 Ria de Arousa\n\nThe Ria de Arousa is the largest of the estuaries of Galicia (Figure 2.4) and is located\n\nbetween the estuary of Muros and Noia to the north and the Pontevedra estuary to the\n\nsouth (42\u00b0 27\u2019 - 42\u00b0 41\u2019N, 8\u00b0 44\u2019 - 9\u00b0 01\u2019W).\n\nThe Ria de Arousa is 33 km in length, 9 km wide on average (8 km in the mouth,\n\n15 km in its wider central area and 2.5 km in the inner area), with a surface area of 239\n\nkm2, a volume of 4.34 km3 and an average depth of 19 m. The Sa?lvora Island divides the\n\nentrance of the estuary into a narrow and shallow northern mouth (5 m deep) and the wider\n\nand deeper southern mouth (55 m deep), through which almost all the water exchange\n\nis occurring. The middle area has intermediate hydrographic characteristics (INTECMAR,\n\nXunta de Galicia) depending on the river discharge, but mainly on the wind regime over the\n\nshelf, which is the main factor governing the hydrodynamic of the Ria [Roson et al., 1995].\n\nThe Ulla River is responsible by freshwater discharge into the estuary, with a catchment\n\narea of 2924 km2 and an annual mean discharge of 76.3 m3 s-1, which range from about 5\n\nm3 s-1 in summer up to 140 m3 s-1 in winter [Otto, 1975]. Small rivers, of which the Umia\n\nRiver is the largest, also discharge into the estuary (Figure 2.1). This river has a catchment\n\narea of 250 km2 and a annual mean discharge of 16.3 m3 s-1 [Roson et al., 1995]. These\n\nrivers and the topography determine the division of the estuary into three well defined areas,\n\ninner, central and outer [Otto, 1975]. The inner area is less than 20 m deep and is strongly\n\ninfluenced by the River Ulla. The outer area (30-60 m deep) has a strong oceanic influence.\n\nThe Ria de Arousa, as the other Rias Baixas, is a partially mixed estuary with a two-\n\nFigure 2.4: Map of the Ria de Arousa.\n\n\n\n2.2 General description 19\n\nlayer positive residual estuarine circulation [Fraga and Margalef, 1979]. The tidal range is\n\n1.1 m and 3.5 m during neap and spring tides, respectively [Hanson et al., 1986].\n\n2.2.2 Minho River\n\nMinho River is an international river in the north of Portugal that crosses Portuguese and\n\nSpanish territory (Figure 2.1). It rises in Serra de Meira (Spain) and flows into the Atlantic\n\nOcean (in front of Caminha and A Guardia) in Portugal, after a total length of about 300 km.\n\nThe upper part of the river is in Spain and the lower 70 km lie within Portuguese territory.\n\nThe river has a catchment area of 17080 km2, 95% of which is located in Spain, and only\n\n5%, in Portugal, and an annual average discharge of 300 m3 s-1. The monthly average\n\ndischarge oscillates between 100 m3 s-1 in August and 800 m3 s-1 in February [Rio-Barja\n\nand Rodriguez-Lestegas, 1996].\n\nThe Minho estuary (41\u00b0 49.0\u2019N - 41\u00b0 55.1\u2019N, 8\u00b0 26.4\u2019- 8\u00b0 56.7\u2019W) is approximately 38\n\nkm long with a total area of 23 km2 (Figure 2.5). The estuary has a maximum width of about\n\n2 km near the mouth, decreasing to about 10 m at the head. In the middle estuary there\n\nis a region of sediment accumulation, which forms several sand banks and islands. The\n\nmean depth of the estuary is 2.6 m and the maximum depth is about 4 m near the mouth\n\n[Freitas et al., 2009]. It presents a semidiurnal, high-mesotidal regime and the range of the\n\nastronomical tide varies between 2 m, during neap tides, and almost 4 m, in spring tides [IH,\n\n2006]. The estuary can be considered as a partially mixed system, although it may present\n\nsalt wedge characteristics during high river flow events [Sousa et al., 2005]. The limit of salt\n\nintrusion is about 35 km from the mouth [Bettencourt et al., 2003].\n\nFigure 2.5: Map of the Minho estuary.\n\n\n\n20 Characterization of the Minho River, Rias Baixas and adjacent coastal zone\n\n2.2.3 Circulation patterns\n\nThe general circulation of the NE Atlantic region is directly dependent on two major current\n\nsystems that transport surface water masses from west to east across the Atlantic: the\n\nNorth Atlantic Current extending to the north of the Iberian Peninsula (48\u00b0N to 53\u00b0N) and\n\nthe Azores Current south of Iberia centred at about 34-35\u00b0N [Saunders, 1982; Pollard and\n\nPu, 1985; Peliz et al., 2005].\n\nThe surface circulation off the NW of the Iberian Peninsula is dominated by the Portugal\n\nCurrent System, which is composed of the slow, equatorward, Iberian basin-scale flow of the\n\nPortugal Current (PC) proper in the open ocean, and the fast, seasonally Portugal Coastal\n\nCurrent (PCC) closer to the shelf break (Figure 2.6).\n\nThe PC is estimated, on average, to extend about 300 km beyond the shelf, transporting\n\nabout 2.0 \u00b1 1.2 Sv [Maze? et al., 1997] at an average of 1.6 cm s-1 [Pollard and Pu, 1985] with\nmaximum speeds reaching up to 5.7 cm s-1 [Martins et al., 2002]. The surface current can\n\nrange between 0.3-12 Sv region-wide (10 Sv at 37.2\u00b0N, 12 Sv at 43\u00b0N and in the narrow strip\n\nbetween 10.5\u00b0W and 1000 m water depths, 9 Sv at 37.2\u00b0N and 4 Sv at 43\u00b0N) [Huthnance\n\net al., 2002; Martins et al., 2002].\n\nDuring summer, the PCC is 30-40 km wide and 50-100 m deep and flows southward\n\n(with maximum values of about 40 cm s-1 [Peliz et al., 2002]) in the vicinity of the shelf break,\n\nbeing driven by upwelling favourable northerly winds. It then transports upwelled, cold and\n\nnutrient-rich ENACW of subpolar origin (> 45\u00b0N, ENACWsp) in the north, and warmer and\n\nnutrient-poor ENACW of subtropical origin (&lt;40\u00b0N, ENACWst) formed along the Azores\n\nFront in the south, while during September to April the PCC piratically vanishes [Alvarez-\n\nSalgado et al., 2003].\n\nDuring the winter, beneath the near-surface equatorward flow of the Portugal and\n\nFigure 2.6: Schematic map of the main circulation features at the NW of the Iberian\nPeninsula. From Varela et al. [2005].\n\n\n\n2.3 Material and methods 21\n\nCanary Currents, there is another current called Iberian Poleward Current (IPC) [Frouin\n\net al., 1990; Peliz et al., 2005]. The IPC is a saltier and warmer poleward current. It\n\nis a narrow (25-40 km) slope trapped tongue like structure that flows northerly along a\n\ndistance exceeding 1500 km off the coasts of the Iberian Peninsula and its magnitude is\n\nof the order of 20 cm s-1. It is a salty surface current (about 200 m deep) geographically\n\ntrapped by the bathymetric discontinuity at the shelf break upper slope zone. Moderately\n\nstrong upwelling and downwelling favourable winds, can modify the poleward flow but do\n\nnot significantly change the density-driven current structure at the slope. The alongshore\n\ntransport within the slope region is reduced by 0.2-0.3 Sv (from 1.2 Sv), under the influence\n\nof either downwelling or upwelling winds [Peliz et al., 2003]. In the coastal region, the surface\n\ncirculation is also influenced by freshwater plumes resulting of the discharge from rivers\n\n(Verdugo-Oitabe?n, Le?rez, Ulla, Umia, Tambre and to the south by the Minho and Douro),\n\ngenerating a persistent buoyant plume, the WIBP [Peliz et al., 2002]. Thus, the WIBP is\n\na low-salinity lens (<35.7) formed by river discharge and continental runoff expanding all\n\nover the shelf, that could reach the 100 m isobath and is about 20 m deep, its thickness\n\nbeing reduced as it approaches to the coast due to the raise of the isopycnals [Varela et al.,\n\n2005]. According to Peliz et al. [2002], under typical winter conditions, the onshore Ekman\n\ntransport driven by southerly winds induces the confinement of the plume to the coast, thus\n\nforcing the WIBP to develop into a narrow coastal current with strong velocities [Otero et al.,\n\n2008]. When the southerly winds weaken or turn northerly, it is advected both southward\n\nwith the upwelling jet and offshore in the Ekman layer, even when wind variation has a short\n\nduration (1-3 h) [Otero et al., 2008].\n\nThe dynamics on the coastal shelf interact with Rias Baixas circulation in distinct ways.\n\nOn one hand, as the Rias Baixas show a positive circulation with surface water leaving the\n\nRias and bottom water entering it [Otto, 1975; Prego and Fraga, 1992]. Coastal upwelling\n\nenhanced this positive circulation, introducing colder and saltier water inside the estuaries\n\n[Wooster et al., 1976; Fiuza et al., 1998]. One the other hand, coastal downwelling causes\n\na reversal of this circulation pattern, characterized by the intrusion of warm coastal waters\n\nat the surface, which accumulates in the Rias interior and finally flows towards the ocean\n\nthrough the bottom [Figueiras et al., 1994, 2002].\n\n2.3 Material and methods\n\nThe data used in this study are: hydrographic parameters surveyed in the two mouths of\n\nthe Rias de Vigo, Pontevedra and Arousa, wind data, air temperature and Minho River\n\ndischarge.\n\nSalinity and water temperature were measured weekly from October 1997 to October\n\n2002 at the surface and deep for the southern (35 m deep) and northern (20 m deep)\n\n\n\n22 Characterization of the Minho River, Rias Baixas and adjacent coastal zone\n\nmouth of each estuary (Figure 2.7). Table 2.2 shows the location of sampling stations.\n\nThese measurements were made using a conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) instrument\n\n(Seabird19 and 25). Salinity calibration was previously performed by means of an \u201dAutosal\u201d\n\nsalinometer. Salinity and water temperature time series were smoothed in order to analyse\n\ntheir seasonal evolution in both mouths of the Rias de Vigo, Pontevedra and Arousa. The\n\nmethodology followed can be summarized in several stages: (1) raw data were analysed in\n\nsuch a way that data out of the range of \u00b13? (where ? is the standard deviation) were\nremoved; (2) data were filtered using a low-pass filter, in such a way that frequencies\n\nhigher than one month were smoothed out, and (3) data gaps (less than 5%), generated\n\nby bad weather conditions and problems in the measuring devices, were filled using a cubic\n\ninterpolation scheme.\n\nThe wind data consists of surface wind fields obtained by the QuikSCAT satellite.\n\nThis dataset consists of global grid values of meridional and zonal components of wind,\n\nmeasured twice a day in an approximately 0.25\u00b0\u00d70.25\u00b0 global coverage grid. Data are\ngiven in an ascending (6 AM) and descending (6 PM) pass. The reference height of wind\n\ndata is 10 m. In addition, it is necessary to note that the wind data close to the coast (?25\nkm) are not available due to the existence of a small land mask. The time series used in this\n\nstudy result of the extraction of the data in a point located at 42\u00b0 15\u2019N, 10\u00b0W .\n\nThe air temperature was provided by the \u201dAgencia Estatal de Meteorolog??a\u201d of Spain\n\nfrom a meteorological station situated at Peinador (42\u00b0 13\u2019N, 8\u00b0 38\u2019W).\n\nDaily Minho River discharge was supplied by the \u201dConfederacio?n Hidrogra?fica del Min?o\n\nSil\u201d. The river discharge considered is the result of averaging the river runoff from the\n\nFigure 2.7: Map of Rias Baixas and sampling stations position (black dots).\n\n\n\n2.4 Results and discussion 23\n\nTable 2.2: Location of the sampling stations.\nSouthern station Northern station\n\nRia de Vigo 42\u00b0 10.7\u2019N, 8\u00b0 52.5\u2019W 42\u00b0 14\u2019N, 8\u00b0 52.7\u2019W\nRia de Pontevedra 42\u00b0 19.5\u2019N, 8\u00b0 53\u2019W 42\u00b0 23.5\u2019N, 8\u00b0 53.5\u2019W\n\nRia de Arousa 42\u00b0 28.5\u2019N, 8\u00b0 58\u2019W 42\u00b0 30.8\u2019N, 8\u00b0 58.8\u2019W\n\nprevious 7 days to the day of hydrographic sampling [Alvarez et al., 2003].\n\nAll of these datasets cover the period October 1997 to October 2002, except the wind\n\ndata provided by the QuikSCAT satellite, which are from July 1999 to October 2002.\n\nUpwelling index was calculated at 43\u00b0N, 11\u00b0W by means of the geostrophic wind speed\n\nobtained from atmospheric fields [Lavin et al., 1991, 2000] and was averaged for 4 days\n\nbefore each cruise. Negative values of upwelling index indicate downwelling conditions,\n\nwhile positive values indicate upwelling conditions.\n\nAdditionally, in order to evaluate the influence of the upwelling index, wind, air\n\ntemperature and Minho River discharge over the salinity and water temperature patterns in\n\nthe Ria de Vigo, correlations between these variables were determined using the correlation\n\ncoefficient (rx,y), which can be calculated by:\n\nrx,y =\ncov(x,y)\n\n?x?y\n(2.1)\n\nwhere cov(x,y ) is the covariance between data and rx,y ranges from -1 to 1.\n\n2.4 Results and discussion\n\n2.4.1 Forcing mechanisms\n\nIn order to study the effect of the major forcing mechanisms in the hydrography of the Rias\n\nBaixas, it is necessary to analyze their seasonal behavior. Upwelling index, air temperature\n\nmeasured at Peinador meteorological station and Minho River discharge were monthly\n\naveraged from October 1997 to October 2002. These means are depicted in Figure 2.8.\n\nA positive or negative upwelling index values indicates favorable (northerly winds) or\n\nunfavourable (southerly winds) upwelling conditions, respectively. As it can be observed in\n\nFigure 2.8a , the upwelling season occurs from April (114.2 m3s-1km-1) to September (33.5\n\nm3s-1km-1). For the rest of the months, winds are predominantly from the south and south-\n\nwest, favouring the predominance of downwelling conditions.\n\nThe air temperature (Figure 2.8b) shows the highest value in August (19.8 \u00b0C), while\n\nthe lowest values corresponds to January (9.2 \u00b0C) and December (9.1 \u00b0C), presenting a\n\nmarked seasonality.\n\n\n\n24 Characterization of the Minho River, Rias Baixas and adjacent coastal zone\n\nFigure 2.8: Monthly mean (October 1977-October 2002) upwelling index (a), air temperature\n(b) and Minho River discharge (c).\n\nThe monthly Minho River discharge shows a typical pattern with high values during\n\nwinter and low values during summer. The maximum value corresponds to October (1457\n\nm3 s-1), and the minimum values are reached in July and August (144 and 123 m3 s-1).\n\n2.4.2 Seasonal evolution of hydrographic parameters\n\nThe near surface and near bottom salinity and water temperature time series from October\n\n1997 to October 2002 for the northern and southern mouths of the Ria de Vigo, Pontevedra\n\nand Arousa are shown in Figures 2.9, 2.10 and 2.11.\n\nRegarding salinity, the surface salinity decreases in the beginning of 1998 (about 5)\n\nand 2001 (about 7) in the Ria de Vigo (Figure 2.9a) and Ria de Pontevedra (Figure 2.10a),\n\nsynchronized with a high Minho River discharge, which reaches 900 m3 s-1 [Alvarez et al.,\n\n2006]. Nevertheless, this decrease in surface salinity is higher for the Ria de Arousa (about\n\n20 for the beginning of 2001) (Figure 2.11a), where the freshwater inflow is higher [Rio-\n\nBarja and Rodriguez-Lestegas, 1996]. The low surface salinities can be also induced by\n\nthe southerly winds (downwelling favourable), which are predominant in the winter months\n\n(Figure 2.8a), and drives the water to enter the Ria through the surface layer. On the\n\nbottom (Figures 2.9b, 2.10b and 2.11b), the northern mouth of the three Rias presents the\n\nsame pattern, which may be related to its shallowness. However, the bottom salinity does\n\nnot exhibit seasonality, because the shelf water intrusion is controlled by the bathymetry\n\n[Guerrero et al., 1997]. However, the salinity difference between surface and bottom is\n\nhigher during winter than summer (see Figures 2.12, 2.13 and 2.14), following the Minho\n\n\n\n2.4 Results and discussion 25\n\nFigure 2.9: Near surface (a,c) and near bottom (b,d) salinity and water temperature time\nseries from October 1997 to October 2002 for the northern and southern mouths of Ria de\nVigo.\n\nFigure 2.10: Near surface (a,c) and near bottom (b,d) salinity and water temperature time\nseries from October 1997 to October 2002 for the northern and southern mouths of Ria de\nPontevedra.\n\n\n\n26 Characterization of the Minho River, Rias Baixas and adjacent coastal zone\n\nFigure 2.11: Near surface (a,c) and near bottom (b,d) salinity and water temperature time\nseries from October 1997 to October 2002 for the northern and southern mouths of Ria de\nArousa.\n\nRiver and the freshwater inflow pattern (Figure 2.8c). A maximum salinity difference was\n\nobserved between January and April in both mouths, with the stratification reaching 2.5.\n\nStratification decreases in summer, due to the strong upwelling events and low rainfall\n\noccurring in this area [Alvarez et al., 2005a]. When comparing both mouths of the same\n\nRia, near surface water in the southern mouth is saltier than in the northern mouth, which is\n\nconsistent with northward surface freshwater deflection induced by the Coriolis force [Ruiz-\n\nVillarreal et al., 2002].\n\nThe water temperature is similar at the surface and near the bottom in both mouths\n\n(Figures 2.9c,d, 2.10c,d and 2.11c,d). Surface water temperature increases from April\n\nto October and decreases at the end of the year (Figures 2.12c, 2.13c and 2.14c). The\n\nbottom water temperature decreases from December to August and increases from August\n\nto November (Figures 2.12d, 2.13d and 2.14d). Surface water temperature is warmer at\n\nthe southern mouths than at the northern ones, due to freshwater deflection to the northern\n\nmouth as mentioned above.\n\nWater temperature values range from 12\u00b0C (17\u00b0C) at the surface to 13\u00b0C (15\u00b0C) near\n\nto bottom in the winter (summer) months. This pattern is related to the air temperature\n\nvariability and freshwater input, since in winter the air is colder than the water, inducing\n\nthe surface water cooling, and the freshwater input is much colder than the seawater. In\n\nsummer it is found the opposite pattern. This superficial cooling affects sub-superficial\n\n\n\n2.4 Results and discussion 27\n\nFigure 2.12: Monthly mean near surface (a,c) and near bottom (b,d) salinity and water\ntemperature for the northern and southern mouths of the Ria de Vigo for the period from\nOctober 1997 to October 2002.\n\nFigure 2.13: Monthly mean near surface (a,c) and near bottom (b,d) salinity and water\ntemperature for the northern and southern mouths of the Ria de Pontevedra for the period\nfrom October 1997 to October 2002.\n\n\n\n28 Characterization of the Minho River, Rias Baixas and adjacent coastal zone\n\nFigure 2.14: Monthly mean near surface (a,c) and near bottom (b,d) salinity and water\ntemperature for the northern and southern mouths of the Ria de Arousa for the period from\nOctober 1997 to October 2002.\n\ndepths decreasing its effect as depth decreases.\n\nOnce again, when comparing both mouths, it can be observed that they have a\n\nsimilar behaviour. However, the highest surface-to-bottom water temperature difference is\n\nobserved in the summer months, reaching 1 \u00b0C for Rias de Vigo and Pontevedra and 2 \u00b0C\n\nfor Ria de Arousa, following the air temperature pattern (Figure 2.8b).\n\nThe bottom water temperature decreases from April to September (Figures 2.12d,\n\n2.13d and 2.14d), due to the presence of a colder water mass (ENACW) and the prevalence\n\nof northerly winds (Figure 2.8a), which pump ENACW from the shelf [Rios et al., 1992b;\n\nPrego et al., 1999]. Moreover, a maximum value in October, associated with the presence\n\nof a warmer water mass on the adjacent shelf is also found, in accordance with previous\n\nresults from Prego et al. [2001]. The same pattern is also observed at the southern mouth.\n\nWhen comparing both mouths of the same Ria, the water temperature is colder at the\n\nsouthern mouth than at the northern one. This situation can be explained by the depth\n\ndifference between both mouths (southern mouths are considerably deeper) and by the\n\ndifferent orientation of the mouths (the southern mouth is aligned with the axis of the Ria,\n\nwhile the northern one opens in the northwest direction) which affects the water circulation\n\n[Alvarez et al., 2005a].\n\n\n\n2.4 Results and discussion 29\n\n2.4.3 Influence of external forcing on hydrographic variables\n\nThe correlations of water temperature and salinity with upwelling index, alongshore wind,\n\nMinho River discharge and air temperature were computed. Upwelling index values and\n\nalongshore wind were used in order to verify the possible upwelling response to the\n\nwind variability. The Minho River discharge and air temperature were used in order to\n\nevaluate their relationship on the establishment of the circulation patterns. The results are\n\nsummarized in Tables 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5.\n\nWith respect to the correlation of upwelling index with bottom salinity and water\n\ntemperature, the first is positive and the second is negative (Tables 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5). In\n\nboth cases, correlations have significance levels greater than 95%. These results show\n\npossibility of occurrence of upwelling events, that is, when the winds blow predominantly\n\nfrom the North and Northwest (positive upwelling index), it is verified that the colder and\n\nTable 2.3: Correlations coefficients between the forcing variables and hydrographic\nparameters for the Ria de Vigo (S: salinity; T: temperature) (a significance level >95%);\nb significance level of 95%); c significance level&lt;95%).\n\nNorthern mouth Southern mouth\nSurface Bottom Surface Bottom\n\nS T S T S T S T\nUpwelling Index 0.226a 0.009a 0.532a -0.352a 0.229a -0.049c 0.480a -0.459a\n\nWind -0.338a -0.047a -0.561a 0.379a -0.324a -0.007c -0.513a 0.462a\n\nDischarge -0.795a -0.317a -0.591a 0.083b -0.848a -0.283b -0.300a 0.247a\n\nAir temperature 0.271a 0.659a 0.200a -0.071c 0.269a 0.554a 0.108c -0.284a\n\nTable 2.4: Correlations coefficients between the forcing variables and hydrographic\nparameters for the Ria de Pontevedra (S: salinity; T: temperature) (a significance level\n>95%); b significance level of 95%); c significance level&lt;95%).\n\nNorthern mouth Southern mouth\nSurface Bottom Surface Bottom\n\nS T S T S T S T\nUpwelling Index 0.174a 0.020a 0.366a -0.322a 0.277a -0.066c 0.341a -0.400a\n\nWind -0.136a -0.020c -0.322a 0.366a -0.217c 0.065c -0.400a 0.341a\n\nDischarge -0.759a -0.270a -0.385a 0.093b -0.762a -0.241a -0.319a 0.205a\n\nAir temperature 0.334a 0.592a 0.391a -0.061c 0.282a 0.547a 0.295a -0.132b\n\nTable 2.5: Correlations coefficients between the forcing variables and hydrographic\nparameters for the Ria de Arousa (S: salinity; T: temperature) (a significance level >95%); b\n\nsignificance level of 95%); c significance level&lt;95%).\nNorthern mouth Southern mouth\n\nSurface Bottom Surface Bottom\nS T S T S T S T\n\nUpwelling Index 0.283a 0.010a 0.369a -0.302a 0.206a -0.016c 0.262a -0.390a\n\nWind -0.165a -0.030c -0.307a 0.218a -0.100a 0.017c -0.201a 0.336a\n\nDischarge -0.713a -0.209a -0.489a 0.116c -0.752a -0.226a -0.274a 0.163a\n\nAir temperature 0.280a 0.596a 0.388a 0.083c 0.286a 0.554a 0.339a -0.136b\n\n\n\n30 Characterization of the Minho River, Rias Baixas and adjacent coastal zone\n\nsaltier water enters the Rias. At surface the upwelling index correlation with salinity was\n\nlow for the three Rias. Although the significance level is greater than 95%, the relationship\n\nbetween water temperature and upwelling index was not statistically significant, showing\n\nthat upwelling events affect only the bottom layers.\n\nThe correlation between the alongshore wind and the bottom salinity in the northern\n\nand southern mouths shows negative values, both in Ria de Vigo (0.561 and -0.513),\n\nPontevedra (-0.322 and -0.400) and Arousa (-0.307 and -0.201). This can be related to\n\nupwelling events, which pump salty water into the Rias mouths [Alvarez et al., 2005a]. A\n\nsimilar pattern can be observed when comparing bottom water temperature, although the\n\ncorrelation is positive in this case, since upwelling events pump cold water into the estuary\n\n(Tables 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5). As it can be observed, the correlation between water temperature\n\nand alongshore wind is lower in the northern mouth, which can be related to its low depth.\n\nAt the surface, the correlation results are similar for salinity and close to zero for water\n\ntemperature, with significance levels lower than 95%.\n\nThe correlations between air temperature and the surface water temperature are higher,\n\nranging from 0.6 and 0.5 in northern and southern mouths, respectively (Tables 2.3, 2.4\n\nand 2.5). Thus, in the northern mouth, the major forcing seems to be the air temperature\n\n(as a consequence of the shallowness of the region), revealing the high influence of the\n\natmosphere.\n\nThe Minho River discharge is negatively correlated with the surface salinity, ranging\n\nfrom -0.759 and -0.713 (northern mouths) and from -0.848 and -0.752 (southern mouths).\n\nThe negative correlation means that when the freshwater inflow increases, the salinity\n\ndecreases in the mouths. Thereby, the increase in salinity from south to the north reveals\n\nthat the observed values may be induced by the Minho River discharge [Mourino and Fraga,\n\n1982].\n\nAs it can be observed in Tables 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5, the water temperature distribution\n\nis found to be weakly dependent on the river discharge and closely related to the air\n\ntemperature. However, the salinity distribution is closely related to the wind variability and\n\nto the Minho River discharge. This result is in accordance with the results obtained for\n\nEspinheiro channel [Vaz and Dias, 2008], where the water temperature distribution is closely\n\nrelated to the freshwater temperature, tide and is also influenced by air temperature patterns\n\ndue to the small depth of the channel. The salinity distribution is closely related with the tide\n\nand with the river discharge.\n\n2.5 Conclusions\n\nIn this chapter was presented a characterization of the hydrography and dynamics of the\n\nNW of the Iberian Peninsula, with special attention to the Rias Baixas adjacent area. This\n\n\n\n2.5 Conclusions 31\n\ncharacterization allowed to identify and understand the role played by the major forcings\n\non the dynamics in this area. A study of the hydrography of the Ria de Baixas mouth in\n\nterms of its major forcing mechanisms, identifying their influence on the establishment of\n\nthe observed patterns was also performed. This study has shown the following:\n\n\u2022 During winter the surface salinity decreases, synchronized with the high Minho River\n\ndischarge. Nevertheless, the surface salinity in the Ria de Arousa was lower than in\n\nthe rest of the Rias, due to the existence of a higher inside river inflow. In the summer,\n\nthe surface-to-bottom salinity difference increases. This surface-to-bottom difference\n\nmay be related to the upwelling events. No seasonality in salinity was observed at the\n\nbottom.\n\n\u2022 The water temperature was similar on the surface and near the bottom, in both mouths.\n\nA surface-to-bottom difference of water temperature, with maximum amplitude of 1\u00b0C\n\nin Rias de Vigo and Pontevedra and 2\u00b0C in Ria de Arousa was observed, following the\n\nair temperature pattern. The water temperature reached a maximum value in October\n\nat all depths associated with the presence of a warmer mass on the adjacent shelf.\n\n\u2022 At the southern mouths, the influence of the upwelling events and of the Minho River\n\ndischarge is more frequent. At the northern mouths, due to the its shallowness, the air\n\ntemperature is the major forcing.\n\n\u2022 It was found that water temperature is weakly dependent on the river discharge and\n\nclosely related to the air temperature pattern, and the salinity is closely related to wind\n\nvariability and to the Minho River discharge.\n\n\n\n32 Characterization of the Minho River, Rias Baixas and adjacent coastal zone\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nWind data assessment to study\ncoastal phenomena along the\nGalician coast\n\n3.1 Introduction\n\nSurface winds over open sea and near coastlines have a great impact on many economic\n\nactivities, including ship routing, coastal management and fisheries. For example, in the\n\nabsence of strong ambient flows, the spreading of plumes and local oceanographic features\n\nof ecological relevance, as upwelling regime, are highly dependent on wind stress. Thus,\n\nin coastal areas, the study of the wind induced phenomena becomes extremely important.\n\nIn addition to their meteorological interest and importance, surface winds play a key role\n\nin numerical studies, being a major forcing mechanism of the circulation of coastal ocean\n\nmodels. This implies that errors in the determination of the surface wind will change the\n\nmodel forcing and consequently will modify the output of the ocean circulation models.\n\nTherefore, for various offshore applications it is fundamental to have accurate wind\n\nspeed and direction, and consequently appropriate tools for their observation or prediction\n\nare essential. A few years ago, the available data for observational studies over the oceanic\n\nregions have been based on anemometer wind measurements from land meteorological\n\nstations. More recently, in situ measurements using oceanographic buoys improve the\n\nknowledge about offshore winds. The data provided from these datasets are generally\n\nlong enough in time and have great temporal resolution. However, these datasets are\n\nwind observations at a single point, coastal or offshore. Additionally, satellite scatterometry\n\nand high-resolution weather forecast models are also frequently used to provide useful\n\nwinds. Satellite data and model predictions of the surface wind field refer to extended\n\n\n\n34 Wind data assessment to study coastal phenomena along the Galician coast\n\ngridded spatial and temporal scales, containing more information than isolated buoys or\n\nland meteorological stations. It should also be noted that satellite measurements are not\n\navailable near coast, limiting its applications in those areas. In other hand, model predictions\n\ncan also be less reliable close to the coast due to the discretization regarding the inland\n\ntopography.\n\nThe Galician shoreline can be divided in three regions (Figure 3.1): the western coast,\n\nstretching from the northern part of Portugal to Cape Finisterre; the middle coast, from Cape\n\nFinisterre to Cape Ortegal; and the northern coast, eastward of Cape Ortegal. Several\n\nstudies have been carried out in terms of wind patterns along the Galician coast [Torres\n\net al., 2003; Alvarez et al., 2005b; Gomez-Gesteira et al., 2006; Alvarez et al., 2008b;\n\nOspina-Alvarez et al., 2010; Alvarez et al., 2011]. According to these studies, wind field\n\nalong this coast is far from homogeneous due to the particular coastal topography and\n\norientation, which modulates wind direction and intensity. Wind observations at a single\n\npoint, coastal or offshore, will not necessarily be representative of the wind conditions along\n\nthe entire coast [Torres et al., 2003]. In this way, the analysis of wind regime along this coast\n\nconstitutes an important task, although the lack of real wind measurements (e.g. buoys and\n\nland meteorological stations) obtained simultaneously and over long time periods makes\n\nthe analysis of the wind patterns difficult near the shoreline. To overcome this difficulty, data\n\nprovided by satellites as QuikSCAT and weather forecast models, can be used to study the\n\nwind regime over the area.\n\nAs it can be derived from previously published work [Pickett et al., 2003; Chelton and\n\nFreilich, 2005; Accadia et al., 2007; Alvarez et al., 2008b; Penabad et al., 2008; Otero and\n\nRuiz-Villarreal, 2008; Pensieri et al., 2010], QuikSCAT is a useful tool to study the wind-\n\ninduced phenomena in the open ocean and near the coast. However, it is necessary to keep\n\nin mind the existence of a small land mask (about 25 km) near shore where data are not\n\navailable. In fact, it has been observed that QuikSCAT wind data tend to be more accurate\n\noffshore than near shore [Pickett et al., 2003; Tang et al., 2004]. This lack of satellite\n\nwind measurements near coast can be overcome using numerical models. Thus, weather\n\nforecast models also constitute an important tool to characterize the wind regime solving\n\ncertain wind features that the satellite is roughly able to estimate, especially near shore.\n\nSince the main aim of this dissertation is to implement a high resolution coastal numerical\n\nmodel to study the Minho River plume intrusion into the Rias Baixas, it is crucial to know\n\nthoroughly the wind fields close to the coast. Once the wind data is assessed, it is possible to\n\nimpose these data as boundary forcing in the coastal numerical model for simulating realistic\n\nscenarios. Therefore, the goals of this chapter are the following: to evaluate the reliability of\n\noffshore winds by the land meteorological stations and to determine the accuracy of wind\n\npatterns along the Galician coast through a comparative analysis between surface winds\n\nobtained from satellite, weather forecast model and in situ observations from buoys. This\n\ncomparison will evaluate wind data quality close to the coast, assessing its applicability to\n\n\n\n3.2 Material and methods 35\n\nFigure 3.1: Bathymetry (m) and subaerial relief (m) of the Galician coast. Black squares,\ndiamonds and stars correspond to the location of oceanographic buoys, meteorological\nstations and QuikSCAT data extraction points, respectively.\n\nstudy the dispersal of Minho estuarine plume.\n\nIn a first approach, a comparative analysis between winds obtained from land\n\nmeteorological stations and offshore QuikSCAT satellite is performed. Secondly,\n\nsurface winds obtained from QuikSCAT data, WRF model predictions and in situ wind\n\nmeasurements from buoys along the Galician coast is also compared.\n\n3.2 Material and methods\n\n3.2.1 Data\n\nWind data used in this study were obtained from four different datasets. The wind\n\nsupplied by the \u201dAgencia Estatal de Meteorolog??a\u201d of Spain for the land meteorological\n\nstations situated at Corrubedo (42\u00b0 35\u2019N, 9\u00b0 6\u2019W) and Peinador (42\u00b0 13\u2019N, 8\u00b0 38\u2019W), and\n\n\u201dAdministrac?a?o do Porto de Viana do Castelo\u201d at the Viana do Castelo land meteorological\n\nstation (41\u00b0 41\u2019N, 8\u00b0 50\u2019W)(Figure 3.1, diamonds) were considered. For the two first stations,\n\nthe wind is measured four times a day over the period January 2000 to December 2001 and\n\n\n\n36 Wind data assessment to study coastal phenomena along the Galician coast\n\nfor the last station it is measured every ten minutes over the period November 2008 to\n\nOctober 2009.\n\nWind data measured at three oceanographic buoys moored near the Galician shelf\n\nbreak were also considered. These buoys, supported by the Spanish Agency Puertos del\n\nEstado, are situated at Silleiro (42\u00b0 7.2\u2019N, 9\u00b0 24\u2019W at 44 km from land), Villano (43\u00b0 29.4\u2019N,\n\n9\u00b0 12.6\u2019W at 30 km from land) and Bares (44\u00b0 3.6\u2019N, 7\u00b0 37.2\u2019W at 38 km from land) (Figure\n\n3.1, squares). They measure wind vectors only over 10 minutes every hour at the 3 m level.\n\nThen an average is calculated and hourly wind vectors are stored.\n\nSurface wind fields obtained by the QuikSCAT satellite are available from July 1999\n\nto November 2009 and were retrieved from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory web site (ftp:\n\n//podaac-ftp.jpl.nasa.gov/allData/quikscat/L3/jpl/v2/hdf/). This dataset consists\n\nof global grid values of meridional and zonal components of wind, measured twice a day in\n\nan approximately 0.25\u00b0\u00d70.25\u00b0 global coverage grid. Data are given in an ascending (6 AM)\nand descending (6 PM) pass and provided with a rain flag. Wind intensity measurements\n\nrange from 3 to 20 m s-1, with an accuracy of 2 m s-1 and 20\u00b0 in direction [JPL, 2001]. The\n\nreference height of wind data is 10 m. In addition, it is necessary to note that the wind data\n\nclose to the coast (?25 km) are not available due to the existence of a small land mask.\nFrom the analysis carried out over several ocean regions [Portabella and Stoffelen, 2001;\n\nStiles and Yueh, 2002; Milliff et al., 2004; Chelton and Freilich, 2005], it was found that the\n\naccuracy of QuikSCAT wind data is very low when the observations are taken under rainy\n\nconditions. This is because scattering from rain drops is higher than the scattering produced\n\nby wind action over the sea surface [Portabella and Stoffelen, 2001]. Thus, QuikSCAT data\n\nmarked with a rain flag were discarded to carry out the study. To perform a spatial analysis of\n\nthe entire area under study, some gaps detected in daily data were objectively interpolated\n\nbetween the four surrounding grid points. This interpolation affects less than 10% of the\n\ntotal data. The time series used in this study results of the data extraction at 3 points: A\n\n(42\u00b0 35\u2019N, 9\u00b0 30\u2019W), B (42\u00b0 13\u2019N, 9\u00b030\u2019W) and C (41\u00b0 41\u2019N, 9\u00b0 30\u2019W) located at a distance\n\nof about 50 km from the nearest shoreline (Figure 3.1, stars).\n\nPredicted wind data around the Galician coast were also provided by the Regional\n\nForecast Agency Meteogalicia (www.meteogalicia.es) through the Weather Research and\n\nForecasting model (WRF) (http://www.wrf-model.org). The ARW (Advanced Research\n\nWRF) core of WRF is ran operationally twice a day, producing numerical weather predictions\n\nup to 72 hours over Galicia. Three two-way nested domains are configured: a first one with\n\n36 km resolution covering the SW of Europe; a second one with 12 km resolution covering\n\nthe Iberian Peninsula; the last one with 4 km resolution over Galicia. In this study, results\n\nfrom the last domain are used. Table 3.1 summarizes the combinations of microphysics and\n\ncumulus parametrizations used with other physics options provided by Meteogalicia. The\n\nwind generated by the model at 10 m over the sea surface (outputted hourly) is from the\n\nPBL scheme (see Table 3.1). Only the measurements corresponding to 6 AM and 6 PM\n\nftp://podaac-ftp.jpl.nasa.gov/allData/quikscat/L3/jpl/v2/hdf/\nftp://podaac-ftp.jpl.nasa.gov/allData/quikscat/L3/jpl/v2/hdf/\nwww.meteogalicia.es\nhttp://www.wrf-model.org\n\n\n3.2 Material and methods 37\n\nTable 3.1: Summary of the WRF parameterizations.\nWRF physics options (three domains)\n\nCumulus Grell\nMicrophysics Thompson\n\nLongwave radiation Rapid Radiative Transfer Model scheme\nShortwave radiation Dudhia scheme\nGround temperature Five-layer soil model\n\nwere used for comparison purposes. A more detailed description of the model can be found\n\nin Skamarock et al. [2008].\n\nSatellite and model datasets cover the period from November 2008 to October 2009\n\n(the last year of available QuikSCAT data), except the wind data provided by the buoys,\n\nwhich do not contain continuous data for this period (Table 3.2).\n\n3.2.2 Methodology\n\nTo evaluate wind quality close to the coast, two different approaches were applied. The\n\nfirst one consists of a simple statistical analysis between offshore QuikSCAT points (Figure\n\n3.1, stars) and land meteorological stations (Figure 3.1, diamonds), in order to analyse\n\nthe relation between offshore and land wind patterns in the Western Galician coast. This\n\nanalysis was carried out in terms of the minimum, mean and standard deviation of the wind\n\nspeed and direction. Due to the different location, satellite wind and wind measured by land\n\nmeteorological station do not necessarily represent the same measurement. Austin and\n\nPierson [1999] showed that satellite scatterometer winds represent synoptic scale winds\n\nwith mesoscale fluctuations removed. Besides the tidal and other supra-inertial effects,\n\ncoastal winds often exhibit diurnal cycles caused mainly by the land\u2013sea interaction, in the\n\nform of breezes. These may be significant in locations with strong land\u2013sea temperature\n\ngradients. With the purpose of removing the mesoscale fluctuations present in the land\n\nmeteorological stations datasets, these data were low-pass filtered with an arbitrary low-\n\npass filtered response of 33 h.\n\nTable 3.2: Available data at the three ocean buoys during the period under study, covering\nthe period November 2008-October 2009.\n\nStation Start End\n\nSilleiro\n5 Dec 2008 6 Mar 2009\n31 Mar 2009 16 Jul 2009\n\nVillano\n1 Nov 2008 29 Jan 2009\n30 Mar 2009 24 Jul 2009\n31 Jul 2009 9 Aug 2009\n\nBares\n1 Nov 2008 23 Jan 2009\n31 Mar 2009 17 Jul 2009\n31 Jul 2009 31 Oct 2009\n\n\n\n38 Wind data assessment to study coastal phenomena along the Galician coast\n\nThe second approach followed consists on a comparative analysis between surface\n\nwinds obtained from QuikSCAT, the WRF model and in situ observations from buoys\n\nalong the Galician coast, with the objective of determining which database offers the\n\nbest representation of the surface ocean wind close to the coast when compared to\n\nmeasured wind. To compare these different datasets, wind speed values provided by\n\nthe oceanographic buoys were adjusted to a 10 m height, assuming neutral stability and\n\na logarithmic wind profile [Large and Pond, 1981; Johnson, 1999]. The method of a\n\nlogarithmically varying wind vertical profile [Ruti et al., 2008] was used instead of other\n\nmethods considering algorithms based on neutral stability correction [Liu et al., 1979; Liu\n\nand Tang, 1996] due to the lack of atmospheric pressure, relative humidity and air and\n\nsea surface temperature data. To adjust the time in wind vectors from all databases, the\n\nmeasurements of buoy winds corresponding to 6 AM and 6 PM were used. The spatial\n\ncollocation between databases was carried out with the QuikSCAT/WRF grid point closest\n\nto the location of each buoy.\n\nTo evaluate the adjustment between the different wind databases, a statistical analysis\n\nwas carried out examining the wind speed and wind direction by means of the correlation\n\ncoefficient,\n\nrD,B =\ncov(D,B)\n\n?D?B\n(3.1)\n\nthe root mean square error (RMSE),\n\nRMSE =\n\n(\n1\n\nn\n\nn?\ni=1\n\n(Di ?Bi)2\n)1\n\n2\n\n(3.2)\n\nthe mean error (ME),\n\nME = (Di ?Bi) (3.3)\n\nand the bias,\n\nBias =\n1\n\nn\n\nn?\ni=1\n\n(Di ?Bi) (3.4)\n\nwhere D corresponds to wind data from QuikSCAT/WRF and B corresponds to buoys\n\nand meteorological stations.

To reduce the discontinuity\n\nbetween 0\u00b0 and 360\u00b0, the QuikSCAT and WRF wind direction was modified using the\n\n\n\n3.3 Results and discussion 39\n\nmethodology proposed by Pensieri et al. [2010], which consists of ?D = ?D ? 360 ? when\n?D ??B > 180 ? and ?D = ?D + 360 ? when ?D ??B &lt;?180 ?.\n\n3.3 Results and discussion\n\nIn this section, an assessment of wind data close to the Galician coast was investigated.\n\nFirstly, a comparative analysis between winds obtained from land meteorological stations\n\nand offshore QuikSCAT satellite was performed. Next, the accuracy of wind patterns along\n\nthe Galician coast was also determined through a comparative analysis between wind\n\nobtained from QuikSCAT satellite, WRF model and in situ from buoys.\n\n3.3.1 Offshore and land wind patterns along the Western Galician coast\n\nThe relation between offshore and land wind patterns in the Western Galician coast was\n\naddressed through an adequate statistical analysis between offshore QuikSCAT points and\n\nin situ land meteorological wind data. The details of this comparison are included as follows.\n\n3.3.1.1 Statistics for the year 2000\n\nAn overview of the seasonal statistics computed for the offshore stations from QuikSCAT\n\n(A and B) and land meteorological stations (Corrubedo and Peinador) for the year 2000 is\n\ngiven in Figure 3.2. The winter is defined as January, February and March and summer as\n\nJuly, August and September.\n\nIn winter, the maximum wind speed presents 17.03 and 16.11 m s-1 and a minimum of\n\n0.54 and 0.31 m s-1 at points A and B, respectively. For the Corrubedo and Peinador land\n\nmeteorological stations the maxima are 12.50 and 6.39 m s-1 and minima are 0.28 and 0.56\n\nm s-1. During the summer, the maxima are 16.00 and 14.00 m s-1 at points A and B and\n\nminima are 8.61 and 5.56 m s-1, respectively (Figure 3.2). The winds measured at the land\n\nmeteorological stations are very much influenced by the orography [Sanchez et al., 2007].\n\nOffshore satellite and land meteorological stations have similar wind direction values during\n\nboth seasons.\n\nA statistical analysis was performed in order to analyse both datasets. Correlations\n\nbetween wind from QuikSCAT and land stations, as well as calculation of bias, ME and\n\nRMSE for the year 2000 were performed (Tables 3.3 and 3.4).\n\nThe wind speed correlation between point A and the Corrubedo land meteorological\n\nstation shows high values, both in winter and summer (0.78 and 0.54). Data from Point B\n\nare stronger correlated with the Peinador alnd meteorological station for the winter (0.83),\n\n\n\n40 Wind data assessment to study coastal phenomena along the Galician coast\n\nFigure 3.2: Wind speed and direction minimum, maximum, mean and standard deviation\nfor offshore QuikSCAT points (A and B) and land meteorological stations (Corrubedo and\nPeinador) for winter and summer 2000.\n\nas opposed to the summer (0.14) (Table 3.3). In respect to the wind direction, the correlation\n\nbetween data from Point A and the Corrubedo land meteorological station ranges from\n\n0.30 (winter) to -0.63 (summer). On the other hand, data from Point B and from the\n\nPeinador land meteorological station presents a wind direction correlation ranging from -\n\n0.76 (winter) to 0.86 (summer). In both cases correlations have significance levels of 5%.\n\nThe great variability of the wind direction and the correlation decreasing at Corrubedo land\n\nTable 3.3: Wind speed comparison between offshore QuikSCAT points (A, B and C) and\nland meteorological stations (Cor-Corrubedo, Pei-Peinador, VC-Viana do Castelo) for winter\n(w) and summer (s) of 2000, 2001 and 2009.\n\nYear Wind Speed\nr Bias (m s-1) ME (m s-1) RMSE (m s-1)\n\nw s w s w s w s\n\n2000\nA/Cor 0.78 0.54 3.51 3.33 3.71 3.52 3.67 3.48\nB/Pei 0.83 0.14 3.91 4.28 4.81 5.25 4.44 4.81\n\n2001\nA/Cor 0.22 0.13 2.28 2.33 3.80 3.90 4.10 3.35\nB/Pei 0.66 0.87 5.27 4.69 6.33 5.13 5.87 4.93\n\n2009 C/VC 0.24 -0.82 1.08 2.32 1.65 2.57 3.63 3.03\n\nTable 3.4: Wind direction comparison between offshore QuikSCAT points (A, B and C) and\nland meteorological stations (Cor-Corrubedo, Pei-Peinador, VC-Viana do Castelo) for winter\n(w) and summer (s) of 2000, 2001 and 2009.\n\nYear Wind Direction\nr Bias (\u00b0) ME (\u00b0) RMSE (\u00b0)\n\nw s w s w s\n\n2000\nA/Cor 0.30 -0.63 77.55 62.36 82.06 65.95 86.40 89.73\nB/Pei -0.76 0.86 39.07 27.05 48.70 33.19 67.80 32.80\n\n2001\nA/Cor -0.15 0.10 -3.44 24.78 -5.73 41.46 121.95 128.57\nB/Pei -0.90 0.13 -51.64 44.70 -61.16 49.96 67.19 72.20\n\n2009 C/VC -0.02 -0.29 119.10 91.32 119.00 92.32 134.50 102.04\n\n\n\n3.3 Results and discussion 41\n\nmeteorological station in the summer may be related to diurnal fluctuations that reflect the\n\nsea-breeze regime. Moreover, results from the northern Portuguese shelf [Vitorino et al.,\n\n2002] indicated that the summer wind variability at time scales > 2 days is about 25% less\n\nthan in winter, and that the main factor affecting wind variability in summer is the sea-land\n\nbreeze, at scales of 1 day.\n\nAs it can be observed in Tables 3.3 and 3.4, both wind speed and directional bias are\n\nalways positive, indicating that offshore satellite data is anticlockwise rotated with respect to\n\nthe land meteorological data. This result is in accordance with Penabad et al. [2008] findings\n\nfor the Galician coast. With respect to the other variables, the values of wind direction ME\n\nare always higher for data from Point A and Corrubedo land meteorological station for both\n\nseasons. However, the opposite can be observed in ME wind speed, where it is higher in\n\nthe Peinador land meteorological station. A seasonal behaviour arises in the ME and RMSE\n\nof wind speed, presenting higher error values in winter. These errors are mainly attributed\n\nto the effect of the distance from the points to the coast. These may be also caused by the\n\nlocal effects near shore, which are not resolved by the satellite. The southeasterly winds\n\nchange frequently and abruptly, associated to passage of frontal systems [Penabad et al.,\n\n2008]. Some errors are due to the wind direction variability, contributing to the relatively high\n\nRMSE values (Table 3.4). Nevertheless, these results reveal that the wind regimes from the\n\ntwo datasets have similar wind direction patterns but some differences in wind speed along\n\nthe Western Galician coast [Gomez-Gesteira et al., 2006].\n\n3.3.1.2 Statistics for the year 2001\n\nThe statistical results of the wind speed and direction for the year 2001 for the offshore\n\nQuikSCAT (points A and B) and land meteorological stations (Corrubedo and Peinador) are\n\npresented in Figure 3.3.\n\nThe wind speed presents higher values than in 2000. In the offshore stations, the\n\nwind speed maximums are 20 and 13 m s-1 during winter and summer, respectively. At\n\nland meteorological stations of Corrubedo and Peinador, the maximums are 14.4 and 11.1\n\nm s-1, and 6.9 and 5.6 m s-1 during the winter and summer, respectively. The maxima\n\noccurring during the winter, in both locations, can be explained by the presence of cold\n\nfronts that affect the study area and are responsible for the wind variability. The wind speed\n\ndifferences between the offshore and land meteorological stations can be also explained by\n\nthe presence of frontal systems, occurring during the winter [Vitorino et al., 2002]. When\n\nthey reach land, these frontal systems lose speed due to the friction exerted by topography.\n\nThus, it is expected that the wind speed at stations near the shore presents values lower\n\nthan at offshore stations. According to the results presented in Figure 3.3, all the statistical\n\nvariables studied herein for the wind direction shows a good agreement between both\n\n\n\n42 Wind data assessment to study coastal phenomena along the Galician coast\n\nFigure 3.3: Wind speed and direction minimum, maximum, mean and standard deviation\nfor offshore QuikSCAT points (A and B) and land meteorological stations (Corrubedo and\nPeinador) for winter and summer 2001.\n\ndatasets.\n\nTaking into account wind speed, the higher correlation values are obtained between\n\npoint B and the Peinador land meteorological station for the winter and summer (0.66 and\n\n0.87). Point A and Corrubedo land meteorological station show lower correlations values\n\n(0.22 winter and 0.13 summer) (Table 3.3). During the winter, the correlation value may\n\nbe related to the strong precipitation occurring in the study area [deCastro et al., 2006c;\n\nLorenzo et al., 2010]. As previously referred, during this season the large-scale circulation\n\nis mainly driven by the position and the intensity of the Iceland Low. The Western Iberia\n\nis affected by westerly winds that carry moist air and produce rainfall events, affecting the\n\nwind variability. During this year occurred a negative phase in the North Atlantic Oscillation\n\n(NAO) index, which represents a reduced pressure gradient, resulting in fewer and weaker\n\nwinter storms crossing the Galician coast [deCastro et al., 2008]. This analysis is confirmed\n\nby Torres et al. [2003], where the winter 2001 was characterized as an \u201catypical\u201d winter\n\nseason.\n\nRelatively to the wind direction, the correlation between data from point B and from the\n\nPeinador land meteorological station ranges from -0.90 in winter to 0.13 in summer (Table\n\n3.4). During the winter, the wind direction has a large variability, therefore it is expected that\n\nthe wind direction varies largely between these two stations, since they are 75 km away.\n\nIn general, according to Torres et al. [2003], the winter winds present larger variability than\n\nsummer winds, showing a decrease in the wind direction correlation.\n\nThe wind speed bias is always positive, ranging from 2.28 m s-1 (A/Corrubedo) to 5.27\n\nm s-1 (B/Peinador) in the winter and 2.33 m s-1(A/Corrubedo) to 4.69 m s-1 (B/Peinador)\n\nin the summer (Table 3.3). During the winter (summer), for both datasets negative\n\n(positive) directional bias are observed, indicating that offshore satellite data are clockwise\n\n\n\n3.3 Results and discussion 43\n\n(anticlockwise) rotated with respect to land meteorological data. It can be observed that ME\n\nis higher in the Peinador land meteorological station, that may be related to the influence of\n\nthe orography (Table 3.3). For the wind speed, RMSE values range from 4.10 to 5.87 m s-1\n\nfor winter and 3.35 to 4.93 m s-1 for summer. The higher RMSE values may be related to\n\nthe very low wind speed (mainly in Peinador).\n\nThese errors are also attributed to the effect of the distance from the points to the\n\ncoast. Therefore, QuikSCAT satellite estimates wind speed as if it were in a neutral stable\n\natmosphere, while land meteorological stations measure wind in real time. These are in\n\naccordance with the results obtained for Gulf of Finland [Soomere and Keevallik, 2003],\n\nwhere the wind speed over the open sea and coastal area differ from 40 to 100%.\n\n3.3.1.3 Statistics for the year 2009\n\nFor the year 2009, the wind speed and direction statistical results for the offshore point C\n\nand Viana do Castelo land meteorological station is presented in Figure 3.4. In the winter\n\n(summer), the minimum was 1.34 (0.18) and 1.31 (0.63) m s-1 at offshore point C and Viana\n\ndo Castelo land meteorological station, respectively. For offshore point C and Viana do\n\nCastelo land meteorological station, the maxima were 17.88 and 14.71 m s-1 (winter and\n\nsummer) and 14.17 and 8.22 m s-1 (winter and summer), respectively (Figure 3.4).\n\nIn fact, the wind speed and direction correlation values for both seasons are lower than\n\n0.29 (Tables 3.3 and 3.4), indicating that offshore and land meteorological stations winds\n\nare out of phase.\n\nIn spite of this low correlation, the values of the bias (1.08 and 2.32 m s-1), ME (1.65\n\nand 2.57 m s-1) and RMSE (3.63 and 3.03 m s-1) (Table 3.3) for the wind speed for the winter\n\nFigure 3.4: Wind speed and direction minimum, maximum, mean and standard deviation for\nthe offshore QuikSCAT point C and Viana do Castelo land meteorological station for winter\nand summer 2009.\n\n\n\n44 Wind data assessment to study coastal phenomena along the Galician coast\n\nand summer respectively are low, showing the similarity of values into both datasets. The\n\nlargest difference can be seen in the wind direction ME (119.1\u00b0 and 92.3\u00b0), which can be\n\nattributed to the effect of the distance to the coast. Finally, the RMSE for the wind direction\n\nare 134.5\u00b0 and 102.0\u00b0 for winter and summer, respectively, showing once again the similarity\n\nof values.\n\nAlthough the comparison of the two wind datasets shows that the offshore wind\n\nfrom QuikSCAT represents adequately the wind patterns measured at land meteorological\n\nstation, in the next sections data from the weather forecast model will be added to the\n\nstudy due to the near-shore land contamination of satellite values and the lack of land\n\nmeteorological stations in the coastal region.\n\n3.3.2 Assessment of wind patterns accuracy along the Galician coast\n\nOnce wind conditions in the Galicia coast are highly variable due to the change of coastline\n\norientation and the complex orographic features, it is crucial to accurately assess wind\n\npatterns by comparing observations at the same local and time. Therefore, only the\n\ncomparison between surface winds obtained from QuikSCAT, WRF and in situ data from\n\nbuoys was performed and the wind data from land meteorological stations were discarded\n\nfrom this analysis.\n\n3.3.2.1 Oceanographic buoys wind data analysis\n\nBuoy data were used to characterize the wind regime over the area under study, the\n\npercentage of events obtained for each range of wind speed according to the Beaufort\n\nwind force scale was summarized in Table 3.5. The wind speeds statistics reveal that the\n\nprobability of light winds (lower than 3.3 m s-1) ranges from 9 to 18%. Gentle, moderate and\n\nfresh breezes represent the prevailing wind regime of this region showing similar percentage\n\nvalues which correspond to a total amount of 63-69%. Finally, the probability of strong winds\n\n(<13.8 m s-1) is very low, ranging from 3 to 8%.\n\nWind roses were also represented to analyse the distribution of wind vectors at the\n\nthree stations measured by the oceanographic buoys (Figure 3.5). Bars indicate the\n\ndirection from which the wind blows. At the Silleiro station, the wind blows predominantly\n\nfrom the North and Northwest directions (along shore). South winds are also observed\n\nalthough with a lower frequency. At the Villano station, the behaviour is slightly different\n\nshowing northeast and southwest winds with similar frequencies. At the Bares station\n\nwas found prevalence of intense easterly wind, whose amplitude tends to surpass 8 m\n\ns-1. The second most prevailing winds are westerly showing lower intensity than observed\n\nfor easterly winds. These results show that coastal winds tend to be aligned with coastal\n\n\n\n3.3 Results and discussion 45\n\nTable 3.5: Percentage of events obtained for each range of wind speed according to the\nBeaufort scale at the three ocean buoys from November 2008 to October 2009.\n\nLimits of wind\nspeed (m s-1)\n\nWind descriptive\nterms\n\nSilleiro\n(%)\n\nVillano\n(%)\n\nBares\n(%)\n\n<1.5 Calm 6 2 3\n1.6-3.3 Light breeze 12 7 9\n3.4-5.4 Gentle breeze 21 18 19\n5.5-7.9 Moderate breeze 20 26 23\n8.0-10.7 Fresh breeze 22 22 27\n\n10.8-13.8 Strong breeze 16 17 15\n>13.9 Near gale 3 8 4\n\norientation [Gomez-Gesteira et al., 2006; Alvarez et al., 2008b, 2011]. In addition, these\n\nwind patterns indicate upwelling favourable conditions during most of the period under\n\nstudy all along the Galician coast. This situation is especially remarkable at the western\n\ncoast (Silleiro) which is characterized by the prevalence of intense north winds (upwelling\n\nfavourable), indicating that these conditions can also occur during autumn-winter [Alvarez\n\net al., 2003; deCastro et al., 2006c; Prego et al., 2007; deCastro et al., 2008; Varela et al.,\n\n2008, 2010; Alvarez et al., 2009]. The occurrence of upwelling events during these seasons\n\ncan have implications on biogeochemical and phytoplankton patterns [Borja et al., 1996;\n\nSantos et al., 2004; Prego et al., 2007]. These circumstances indicate that the accurate\n\nwind regime characterization during periods as the one analysed in the present study is\n\nfundamental to clarify the occurrence of these phenomena and, consequently, to determine\n\ntheir possible impact on coastal ecosystems.\n\nFigure 3.5: Wind rose diagrams (m s-1) calculated at the three oceanographic buoys over\nthe period November 2008 to October 2009.\n\n\n\n46 Wind data assessment to study coastal phenomena along the Galician coast\n\n3.3.2.2 Comparison of forecast and satellite winds with buoy data\n\nWind speed data from QuikSCAT, WRF and buoys were fitted to a Weibull distribution\n\nin order to characterize the variability among the different datasets and to calculate the\n\nprobability of finding particular wind speeds at each coastal station (Figure 3.6). Weibull\n\ndistribution gives an approximate but generally good fit to the observed wind speed\n\ndistribution [Sanchez et al., 2007; Otero and Ruiz-Villarreal, 2008]. The selection of this\n\ndistribution is often attributed to its flexibility, which assures a good fit to the observed data.\n\nModerate winds are very common all along the coast, although some differences can be\n\nobserved depending on the coastal area. At the western and middle coast a similar pattern\n\ncan be observed between WRF and in situ wind observations showing almost the same\n\nbehaviour. QuikSCAT tends to underestimate (overestimate) the occurrence of winds lower\n\n(higher) than 5-6 m s-1. At the northern coast the distributions of QuikSCAT and WRF\n\ndata are different from the buoy data, indicating a lower accuracy for both databases at this\n\ncoastal area.\n\nTable 3.6 shows the Weibull shape parameter (?), which refers to the width of the\n\ndistribution, and the scale parameter (?) which is related to the mean wind speed. The most\n\ncommonly occurring wind speed (Wm) was also considered. The shape parameter presents\n\nvalues about 2 at the three stations independently of the database. The maximum value\n\nFigure 3.6: Wind speed occurrence at the three stations fitted to a Weibull distribution (grey-\nQuikSCAT; black-WRF; dashed black-buoy) over the period November 2008 to October\n2009.\n\n\n\n3.3 Results and discussion 47\n\nTable 3.6: Weibull shape parameter (?), scale parameter (?) and the most commonly\noccurring wind speed (Wm) corresponding to the Weibull distributions shown in Figure 3.6.\n\nStation ? ?

In addition, the scale parameter corresponding to the model and buoys show a similar\n\nmagnitude at the three stations indicating that the WRF model predictions presents better\n\nresults than the satellite measurements. The most common wind speed ranges from about 5\n\nto 7 m s-1 among the different databases and stations showing that moderate winds are very\n\ncommon. The highest value of Wm is also observed for QuikSCAT data at the three stations\n\n(between 6.2-6.9 m s-1). At the western and middle coast model predictions and buoys data\n\nshow a similar value. Nevertheless, at the northern coast, QuikSCAT data present a value of\n\nWm closer to the buoy measurements showing a higher accuracy of the satellite to measure\n\nthese winds.\n\nA more detailed analysis can be carried out considering different limits of wind speed.\n\nAccording to the results shown in Table 3.5, three different intervals are considered. The\n\nfirst one includes calms and light breezes (0-3.3 m s-1), the second corresponds to values\n\nbetween gentle and fresh breezes (3.4-10.7 m s-1) and the last one considers values higher\n\nthan strong breezes (> 10.8 m s-1). Table 3.7 shows the RMSE and bias calculated for\n\nthese intervals using the QuikSCAT/WRF and buoy data. The different limits of wind speed\n\nare classified according to the values measured by the buoy. The bias is calculated as the\n\ndifference between QuikSCAT/WRF values and buoy values. Thus, a positive bias in wind\n\nspeed means that QuikSCAT/WRF tends to overestimate winds. The analysis by speed\n\nintervals shows similar RMSE results for QuikSCAT and WRF at the three stations. Bias\n\ndistribution is less consistent. RMSE values tend to be higher at low winds (&lt;3.3 m s-1) for\n\nsatellite and forecasted data at the three stations agreeing with the highest values of bias.\n\nModerate winds show the lowest errors also at the three stations both for QuikSCAT and\n\nWRF. Note that these winds are the most commonly observed along the coast (Figure 3.6)\n\nand therefore, the highest number of samples is obtained within this interval. The statistical\n\nanalysis was also carried out over the whole range speed (last row) and a weighted mean\n\nwas calculated at the three stations, in terms of the number of samples existent in each bin.\n\nThus, some data points contribute more than others to the final average. When comparing\n\n\n\n48 Wind data assessment to study coastal phenomena along the Galician coast\n\nwind speed results for the three locations, the RMSE values obtained for the satellite (about\n\n1.5 m s-1) are always lower than those for the model (about 2 m s-1). Bias shows the\n\nopposite behaviour with the lowest absolute values found for the model. In addition, bias is\n\nalways positive for QuikSCAT (about 0.5 m s-1), indicating that the satellite overestimates\n\nwind intensity at the three stations. For the model there is a clear pattern showing a positive\n\nbias value at the western and middle coast and negative one at the northern coast. Thus,\n\nat the northern coast, forecasted data tend to be lower than in situ observations.\n\nAccording to the previous results obtained from the Weibull analysis (Figure 3.6, Table\n\n3.6), macroscopically at the western and middle coasts, forecasted data tend to present\n\nbetter results than the satellite data, showing wind patterns more similar to those determined\n\nfrom buoys measurements. Nevertheless, from the statistical analysis (Table 3.7) the RMSE\n\nvalues obtained for the satellite data are lower than the corresponding forecasted data, while\n\nthe bias distribution shows the lowest absolute values for the model.\n\nThe wind direction variability was analysed considering the differences between\n\nQuikSCAT/WRF and buoy data. Figure 3.7 shows the dependence of wind direction\n\ndifference between WRF-buoy (QuikSCAT-buoy) data on the buoy wind speed at the left\n\ncolumn (right column) for the three stations.\n\nA common pattern can be observed for WRF and QuikSCAT with most of the points\n\ndistributed between -45\u00b0 and 45\u00b0. The highest variations are observed for low wind speeds\n\n(&lt;3 m s-1). In fact, the standard deviations (bars) increase at low wind speeds for the three\n\nstations, as consequence of the complexity to define the direction for these events. For low\n\nwind speeds, it is more difficult to measure the wind direction. Winds over 15 m s-1 were not\n\nincluded in the calculations of the mean (black points) and standard deviation values (bars)\n\ndue to the low number of samples, since their inclusion could result in a greater margin of\n\nerror. In addition, high wind speeds are usually associated to bad weather conditions which\n\ncan cause buoys oscillations in the higher waves as well as surface layer distortion [Large\n\net al., 1995; Ebuchi et al., 2002] and therefore, buoys measurements become less reliable.\n\nTo better characterize the wind direction variability, a detailed analysis was carried out\n\nconsidering the four main direction sectors calculating the RMSE and bias for wind direction\n\nat the three stations for QuikSCAT and WRF data (Table 3.8). As in Table 3.7, direction\n\nsectors are classified according to the values measured by the buoy. The bias is calculated\n\nas the difference between QuikSCAT/WRF values and buoy data. Thus, a positive bias in\n\nwind direction means that QuikSCAT/WRF tends to rotate winds clockwise. Comparing the\n\nwind direction results analysed by sectors at the three stations, the RMSE is lower for the\n\nmost frequent sectors (Figure 3.5), both for QuikSCAT and WRF. Thus, at the western coast\n\nthe lowest RMSE values are obtained for S winds. At the middle coast, the lowest RMSE\n\nvalues correspond to the W direction and at the northern coast to the E and W direction.\n\nIt is also important to note the higher RMSE obtained for the model at the western coast\n\nfor W winds (65.5\u00b0) and at the northern coast for N winds (65.9\u00b0).

Black points represent the average of the differences based on 3 m\ns-1 bins and bars represent the standard deviation.\n\n3.5, these winds are uncommon and the high RMSE can be due to the low number of\n\nsamples. Nevertheless, the RMSE values obtained for QuikSCAT at the same sectors have\n\nconsiderable lower values which could indicate lower model accuracy when in situ measured\n\nwinds come from land due to an insufficient model resolution regarding the complexity of\n\ncoastal topography. For bias distribution there is not a clear pattern for QuikSCAT and WRF\n\nand values are dependent on the considered sector and station. Weighted means were\n\nalso used to analyse the overall patterns (lower row). The RMSE values obtained for the\n\nsatellite and the model are similar at the three stations (around 35\u00b0). For both databases a\n\npositive bias is obtained at the western coast and a negative bias at the intermediate and\n\nnorthern coast. In terms of bias absolute value, the forecasted data present lower values\n\nat the three stations. Note that they can be dependent on the positive/negative distribution\n\nof bias values analysed by sectors. Thus, at the western coast QuikSCAT tends to present\n\n\n\n3.3 Results and discussion 51\n\npositive bias values while at the middle and northern coasts bias values tend to be negative.\n\nThe bias distribution corresponding to the model is less consistent.\n\n3.3.3 QuikSCAT vs. WRF\n\nWith respect to the previous results, it was found that the WRF model and QuikSCAT\n\ndata reproduce with reasonable accuracy the wind patterns measured by the buoys. In\n\nthis section, the analysis of both datasets at each grid point around the Galician coast\n\nis also evaluated for the full period under study by means of an annual average. The\n\nannual mean wind pattern is calculated by averaging daily values provided by QuikSCAT and\n\nWRF at each grid point (Figure 3.8a, 3.8b). For the spatial comparison, model data were\n\ninterpolated on a grid of 0.25\u00b0\u00d70.25\u00b0 using a bi-cubic interpolation. Both datasets reproduce\napproximately the same pattern in wind direction with some differences in wind speed. The\n\nwind speed increases from north to south for both databases showing higher values for\n\nsatellite data over the entire domain. QuikSCAT minus WRF values were used to evaluate\n\nand quantify the differences in wind speed, through the computation of RMSE (Figure 3.8c)\n\nand bias (Figure 3.8d). The maximum RMSE values (about 2.2 m s-1) are observed around\n\nCape Finisterre mainly closer to coastline. Bias distribution shows positive values for the\n\nentire domain indicating that QuikSCAT tends to overestimate wind speed. The highest\n\nvalues of bias (about 0.7 m s-1) are also observed north and south of Cape Finisterre near\n\nthe shoreline. On the one hand, these results could be explained by the land mask for\n\nQuikSCAT data near shore. In fact, previous studies have shown that due to this mask,\n\nsatellite measured winds tend to be more accurate offshore than near shore [Pickett et al.,\n\n2003; Tang et al., 2004]. On the other hand, it is necessary to consider the possibility of\n\nan insufficient model resolution regarding the complexity of the Galician coastal topography\n\nwhich could influence the model results near the shoreline. Wind direction differences were\n\nalso analysed through the RMSE (Figure 3.8e) and bias (Figure 3.8f). The highest values\n\nof RMSE (about 38\u00b0) are observed at the western coast near the shoreline. These values\n\ncould be explained by the fact that model results tend to be less accurate when measured\n\nwinds come from land (see Table 3.8). At the most eastern part of the northern coast high\n\nvalues of RMSE are also observed, although they are more dependent on the low wind\n\nspeed measured all over the northern coast (Figure 3.8a,3.8b). Bias distribution shows low\n\nvalues for the entire domain. Along the western coast the highest positive values (about\n\n6\u00b0) near the shoreline are identified, indicating that QuikSCAT tends to rotate clockwise the\n\nwind direction. For the rest of the area bias values range between -1\u00b0 and 2\u00b0.\n\n\n\n52 Wind data assessment to study coastal phenomena along the Galician coast\n\nFigure 3.8: Mean annual wind circulation obtained from satellite (a) and model (b) along the\nGalician coast from November 2008 to October 2009. RMSE and bias for wind speed (c,d)\nand wind direction (e,f) from QuikSCAT-WRF data.\n\n\n\n3.4 Conclusions 53\n\n3.4 Conclusions\n\nThe main objectives of this chapter were to evaluate wind data quality close to the coast,\n\nassessing its applicability to study the dispersal of Minho estuarine plume. Thus, the relation\n\nbetween offshore and land wind patterns, and an assessment of wind patterns accuracy\n\nfrom the QuikSCAT satellite and the WRF model were performed. From these analysis, the\n\nfollowing can be concluded:\n\n\u2022 Despite the deviations found in the comparative analysis performed, the offshore data\n\nfrom the QuikSCAT satellite has revealed to constitute a good approach to the wind\n\ndata measured in land meteorological stations.\n\n\u2022 Near the coast, the wind pattern strongly depends on coastal geometry and orography.\n\nDuring the study periods, the wind regime was similar for the years 2000 and 2009.\n\nThe winter 2001 was characterized by the passage of cold frontal systems that affected\n\nthe study area. They induced important wind variability. Thereby, during the winter,\n\nthe wind variability was larger than in the summer.\n\n\u2022 The accuracy of the wind speed derived from the QuikSCAT and the WRF model was\n\nsimilar all along the coast, showing RMSE errors between 1.5 m s-1 and 2 m s-1. The\n\ncalculated bias for QuikSCAT data was positive at the three stations (0.5 m s-1) while\n\nthe bias for WRF predictions was positive at the western (0.3 m s-1) and middle (0.1\n\nm s-1) coast and negative at the northern one (-0.3 m s-1).\n\n\u2022 Similar RMSE values were found for wind direction at the three stations (35\u00b0). Wind\n\ndirection bias also showed a similar pattern between satellite and forecasted data, with\n\npositive values at the western coast and negative values at the middle and northern\n\ncoasts, although always lower in absolute value for WRF data.\n\n\u2022 From the analysis carried out considering different wind speed ranges, it was found\n\nthat QuikSCAT tends to overestimate wind speeds within the whole ranges. RMSE\n\nand biases tend to be lower for moderate winds at the three stations both for satellite\n\nand forecasted data.\n\n\u2022 Regarding the direction sectors analysis, the lowest errors and biases were observed\n\nat the same sectors for both databases at the three stations (S: Silleiro; W: Villano;\n\nE-W: Bares). The model tends to be less accurate when in situ measured winds come\n\nfrom land.\n\n\n\n54 Wind data assessment to study coastal phenomena along the Galician coast\n\n\u2022 From the spatial comparison between satellite and forecasted data it was found that\n\nthe forecasted winds tend to be lower than satellite winds over the entire domain, with\n\nthe highest RMSE and bias values found near shoreline.\n\nIn summary, the analyses revealed that the WRF model is a consistent tool to obtain\n\nrepresentative wind data near the coast showing good results when comparing with in situ\n\nwind observations. Thus, in the oceanographic numerical modelling implementation that will\n\nbe developed in this study, the WRF data will be used as the surface boundary condition.\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nNumerical model\n\n4.1 Introduction\n\nTo study the propagation and influence of the Minho estuarine plume on the Rias Baixas\n\ncirculation and hydrography, the numerical model MOHID was used. MOHID (www.mohid.\n\ncom) is a three-dimensional free surface numerical model under development at the Instituto\n\nSuperior Te?cnico (Universidade Te?cnica de Lisboa) [Santos, 1995; Martins et al., 2001;\n\nLeita?o, 2002; Leita?o et al., 2005; Vaz et al., 2009b; Mateus et al., 2012]. This model\n\nhas the ability to simulate flows in shallow systems, like the Minho estuary, as well as to\n\nstudy the Western Iberian coastal circulation, and it has been previously applied to simulate\n\nthe Galician Rias [Taboada et al., 1998; Gomez-Gesteira et al., 1999; Ruiz-Villarreal et al.,\n\n2002]. Thus, to achieve the main objectives of this work two model applications composed\n\nby a coastal nested model and an estuarine model were designed. The first one is used to\n\nsimulate the propagation of the Minho River plume towards the Rias Baixas and analyse the\n\neffects of the plume intrusion into these estuaries. The second one runs offline and it was\n\ndeveloped to reproduce the Minho estuary-ocean interaction.\n\nTherefore, a general overview of the MOHID is performed in this chapter, presenting the\n\nmain formulations solved by the model. Also, a nesting numerical modeling methodology\n\ndeveloped to reproduce the propagation of the Minho estuarine plume towards the Rias\n\nBaixas is described.\n\nwww.mohid.com\nwww.mohid.com\n\n\n56 Numerical model\n\n4.2 Model physics\n\n4.2.1 Equations\n\nThe model solves the three-dimensional incompressible primitive equations. Hydrostatic\n\nequilibrium is assumed as well as Boussinesq and Reynolds approximation. All the\n\nequations below have been derived taken into account these approximations. Only a\n\nsummary of the model information is presented here. A more detailed description of the\n\nnumerical algorithms can be found in Santos [1995], Martins et al. [2001], Leita?o [2002] and\n\nVaz [2007]. The hydrodynamic model solve the primitive equations in Cartesian coordinates\n\nfor incompressible flows. The momentum evolution equation is portrayed in Equation 4.1:\n\n?ui\n?t\n\n+\n?(uiuj)\n\n?xj\n= ?\n\n1\n\n?0\n\n?patm\n?xi\n\n?g\n?(?)\n\n?0\n\n??\n\n?xi\n?\n\ng\n\n?0\n\n? ?\nx3\n\n??\n?\n\n?xi\ndx3 +\n\n?\n\n?xj\n\n(\n?\n?ui\n?xj\n\n)\n? 2?ijk?juk (4.1)\n\nwhere ui is the velocity vector components in the Cartesian coordinates xi directions, ? is\n\nthe turbulent viscosity, ? is the free surface elevation, g is the gravity acceleration and patm\nis the atmospheric pressure. ? is the density, ?? is its anomaly, ?0 is the reference density\n\nand ?(?) represents the density at the free surface, t is the time, h is the depth, ? is the\n\nEarth velocity of rotation and ? is the alternate tensor.\n\nThe mass balance equation (continuity) is:\n\n?ui\n?xi\n\n= 0 (4.2)\n\nThe vertical velocity is calculated from the continuity equation (Equation 4.2) by\n\nintegrating between the bottom -h and the depth x3 where u3 is to be calculated:\n\nu3(x3) =\n?\n\n?x1\n\n? ?\n?h\nu1dx3 ?\n\n?\n\n?x2\n\n? ?\n?h\nu2dx3 (4.3)\n\nThe free surface equation (Equation 4.4) is obtained by integrating the continuity\n\nequation over the whole water column (between the free surface elevation ?(x,y) and the\n\nbottom -h):\n??\n\n?t\n= ?\n\n?\n\n?x1\n\n? ?\n?h\nu1dx3 ?\n\n?\n\n?x2\n\n? ?\n?h\nu2dx3 (4.4)\n\n\n\n4.2 Model physics 57\n\nThe hydrostatic approximation gives:\n\np(z) = patm + ?0g(? ?z) + g\n? ?\nz\n?\n?\ndz (4.5)\n\nEquation 4.5 relates pressure at any depth with the atmospheric pressure at the free\n\nsurface, the sea level and the anomaly pressure integrated between the level and the\n\nsurface.\n\nThe model also solves a transport equation for salinity, water temperature or any other\n\ntracer:\n??\n\n?t\n+ uj\n\n??\n\n?xj\n=\n\n?\n\n?xj\n\n(\nK\n??\n\n?xj\n\n)\n+ FP (4.6)\n\nwhere ? is the transported property, K is the diffusion coefficient and FP is a possible source\n\nor sink term.\n\nFinally, the density ? is calculated as a function of water temperature and salinity by a\n\nsimplified equation of state [Leendertse and Liu, 1978]:\n\n? =\n(\n5890 + 38T ? 0.375T 2\n\n)\n/(1179.5 + 11.25T ? 0.0745T 2 ? (3.8 ? 0.01T) S\n\n+ 0.698\n(\n5890 + 38T ? 0.375T 2 + 3S\n\n)\n) (4.7)\n\n4.2.2 Lagrangian model\n\nLagrangian transport models are very useful to simulate localized processes with sharp\n\ngradients, such as discharge by submarine outfalls, sediment erosion due to dredging\n\nworks, oil dispersion and water quality. This particle tracking model is a subset of the\n\nMOHID modelling system and has been used to study pollutant dispersion [Gomez-Gesteira\n\net al., 1999; Braunschweig et al., 2003]. The Lagrangian module derives the hydrodynamic\n\ninformation (current fields) from the system and updates the calculations without having the\n\nneed to solve all the variables at the same time. It uses the concept of passive tracers,\n\ncharacterized by their spatial coordinates, area and a list of properties. The particle tracking\n\nmodel assumes that the velocity of each particle (up) can be split into a large scale organized\n\nflow, characterized by a mean velocity (uM), provided by the model, and a smaller scale\n\nrandom fluctuation (uF) so that up=uM+uF. The particle tracking model used the equation:\n\ndxi\ndt\n\n= ui(xi, t) (4.8)\n\n\n\n58 Numerical model\n\nwhere ui is the mean velocity and xi the particle position, this equation is solved using and\n\nexplicit method:\n\nxt+?ti = x\nt\ni + ?tu\n\nt\ni (4.9)\n\nThe random movement is calculated following the procedure of Allen [1982], and the\n\nrandom displacement is calculated using the mixing length and the standard deviation of\n\nturbulent velocity provided from the hydrodynamic model. Particles retain velocity during the\n\nnecessary time to perform the random movement, which is dependent on the local turbulent\n\nmixing length.\n\nThe increase in volume is associated with small-scale turbulence and is reasonable to\n\nassume it as isotropic. In these conditions, small particles keep their initial form and their\n\nincrease in volume is a function of the volume itself. In this study every particle is considered\n\nas a water parcel whose paths are modelled as their move through the water.\n\n4.2.3 Equations discretization\n\nThe MOHID model uses a finite volume approach to discretize the equations in a\n\nstructured grid. In this approach, the discrete form of the governing equations is applied\n\nmacroscopically to a cell control volume. This method makes the solution independent of\n\nthe mesh geometry, allowing the use of a generic vertical mesh [Martins et al., 1998, 2001].\n\nThe equations are discretized horizontally using an Arakawa C staggered grid. All types of\n\nvertical coordinates have a wetting/drying cell scheme. Temporal discretization is performed\n\nby a semi-implicit Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) algorithm to compute the sea level\n\nevolution with two time levels per iteration, following the method proposed by Leendertse\n\n[1967]. The two components of the horizontal velocity are globally centred in time, t+dt/2,\n\nleading to a second order time accuracy [Martins et al., 1998, 2001]\n\nFor the baroclinic force, MOHID uses a z-level approach for any type of vertical\n\ncoordinate. This methodology integrates the horizontal density gradient always into the\n\nCartesian space. Advection and diffusion of tracer properties such as water temperature\n\nand salinity are computed explicitly in the horizontal and implicitly in the vertical, using a\n\nTotal Variation Diminishing (TVD) Superbee method. Vertical turbulent mixing is computed\n\nusing the k-? model, while for the horizontal, constant coefficients are assumed. The MOHID\n\nmodel is coupled to the General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM) [Burchard et al., 1998].\n\nGOTM is a water column model which simply allows a choice between some standard\n\nturbulence parametrizations. In this work, the parametrization proposed by Canuto et al.\n\n[2001] is used.\n\n\n\n4.2 Model physics 59\n\n4.2.4 Boundary conditions\n\nFive different types of boundaries were used in this study: free surface, bottom, lateral\n\nclosed boundary, lateral opened boundary and moving boundary.\n\nAt the free surface boundary, advective fluxes of mass and momentum across the\n\nsurface are assumed null, imposing a null W vertical flux:\n\nWflux|surface = 0 (4.10)\n\nDiffusive flux of momentum is imposed explicitly by means of a wind surface stress, ~?W :\n\n?3\n?ui\n?x3\n|surface = ~?W , i = 1, 2 (4.11)\n\nwhere ?3 is the vertical eddy viscosity. The wind stress is calculated according to a quadratic\n\nfriction law:\n\n~?W = CD?a ~W |~W | (4.12)\n\nwhere CD is a drag coefficient that is a function of the wind speed (W ) measured 10 m\n\nabove the sea surface and ?a is the air density.\n\nAt the bottom boundary, the water flux is also assumed null and a quadratic law is used\n\nto calculate the bottom stress:\n\n?3\n?ui\n?x3\n|bottom = CDui\n\n?\nu21 + v\n\n2\n2, i = 1, 2 (4.13)\n\nFor stability reasons the bottom stress must be calculated implicitly in the momentum\n\nequation of the bottom cell.\n\nThe closed boundaries of the domain correspond to land. A free slip condition is used\n\nto resolve this lateral boundary, imposed by specifying a zero normal component of mass\n\nand momentum diffusive fluxes at cell faces in contact with land.\n\nAt the ocean open boundary the free surface elevation is imposed and at the river\n\nboundaries the flow is specified.\n\nMoving boundaries are closed boundaries whose position varies with time. Intertidal\n\nzones generate moving boundaries in the alternate wetting/drying areas. A detailed\n\nexplanation of the algorithms used in MOHID can be found in Martins et al. [2001] and\n\nLeita?o [2002].\n\n\n\n60 Numerical model\n\n4.3 Model implementation\n\nTo investigate the dynamics of the Minho estuarine plume two downscaling methodologies\n\nsimilar to the one proposed by Leita?o et al. [2005] and Vaz et al. [2009b], for simulating\n\nthe Algarve coastal circulation and Tagus estuarine plume were developed. Two nested\n\nconfigurations with three levels one-way nested grids and an estuarine model were\n\nimplemented. The nested configurations are used to simulate the propagation of the Minho\n\nRiver plume towards the Rias Baixas and analyse the effects of the plume intrusion into\n\nthese estuaries. The estuarine model runs offline and was developed to reproduce the\n\nMinho estuary-ocean interaction, computing the estuarine outflow which is introduce as a\n\npoint discharge in the coastal model. A coarse model for the entire coast of the Iberian\n\nPeninsula (\u2018\u201dfather\u201d model) supplies boundary conditions for finer models applied to the\n\nRias Baixas and the adjacent coastal area (\u201dson\u201d model). The communication between\n\nthe \u201dfather\u201d and \u201dson\u201d models is made by relaxation of the horizontal and meridional\n\ncomponents, through an eleven cell band adjacent to the lateral boundary. The \u201dson\u201d model\n\ndid not exchange information with the \u201dfather\u201d model.\n\nThe two configurations only differ in the source of the initial forcing conditions. The first\n\none comes from Levitus climatology (called Configuration #1 hereafter) and the second one\n\ncomes from Mercator Open Global Solution (called Configuration #2 hereafter), respectively.\n\nThere was a need to test and implement these two configurations, in order to check which\n\nconfiguration best represents the Minho estuarine plume propagation.\n\nThe two nested models comprise a large domain, used to compute the barotropic\n\ntide, and two smaller baroclinic domains, which are used to simulate the estuarine plume\n\nadvection (schematized in Figure 4.1). The main difference between the second and third\n\ndomains is the horizontal resolution, which is coarser for the second domain, and also that\n\nthe third domain comprises a smaller region. The downscaling approach was implemented\n\nto smooth the transition between first and third solutions. Therefore, the second domain\n\ncan be seen as the transition between the low-frequency solutions, while the third extracts\n\ninformation from the larger-scale models to provide adequate boundary conditions for its\n\nopen boundaries as well as initial conditions.\n\n4.3.1 Configuration of the coastal nested model including the Rias Baixas\n\n4.3.1.1 Configuration #1\n\nThe first domain (L1) (Figure 4.2) ranges from 13.5\u00b0W to 1\u00b0 E and 33.5\u00b0N to 50\u00b0N, with a\n\nvariable horizontal resolution changing from 0.02\u00b0 (? 2 km) near the coast to 0.06\u00b0 (? 6 km)\noffshore and was constructed based on the ETOPO1 global database. This domain is a 2D\n\n\n\n4.3 Model implementation 61\n\nFigure 4.1: Schematic diagram of the MOHID.\n\nbarotropic tidal driven model using the FES2004 (Finite Element Solution) global solution\n\nas forcing [Lyard et al., 2006]. The time step is 180 s and the horizontal eddy viscosity is\n\n100 m2 s-1. For the levels, at the open boundary a radiation boundary scheme was used\n\n[Blumberg and Kantha, 1985]. The ocean boundary conditions are given in cascade starting\n\nat the first level.\n\nThe second domain (L2) (Figure 4.2) comprises a region from 10.08\u00b0W to 8.40\u00b0W\n\nand 40.92\u00b0N to 43.5\u00b0N with a horizontal resolution of 0.02\u00b0 (? 2 km). The third domain\n\nFigure 4.2: The MOHID nesting system implemented for Configuration #1.\n\n\n\n62 Numerical model\n\n(L3) (Figure 4.2) is from 9.52\u00b0W to 8.60\u00b0W and 41.68\u00b0N to 42.86\u00b0N with a horizontal step\n\nof 0.005\u00b0 (? 500 m) and includes the Rias Baixas adjacent coastal area and it is directly\ncoupled to L2 at the open boundaries. Higher resolution is used in order to properly simulate\n\nthe small scale processes inside the estuary and also the plume dispersion. The L2 and\n\nL3 bathymetries were constructed based on the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans\n\n(GEBCO), with some corrections on the continental shelf. A z-level vertical discretization\n\nwas adopted, with L2 and L3 having 46 and 42 vertical layers, where the bottom 39 (L2), 35\n\n(L3) are in Cartesian coordinates and the top 10 m are 7 sigma coordinate layers.\n\nTo obtain the initial ocean stratification, L2 and L3 are forced at the open boundaries\n\nwith monthly mean climatologies from Levitus (http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/WOA09/\n\npr_woa09.html) [Antonov et al., 2010; Locarnini et al., 2010]. In the second level a time\n\nstep of 60 s is used, and the turbulent horizontal eddy viscosity inside the domain is set to\n\n20 m2 s-1. The third level uses a time step of 15 s and a turbulent horizontal eddy viscosity\n\nof 5 m2 s-1. Furthermore, in both levels, the zonal and meridional velocity components,\n\nsalinity and water temperature in boundary cells are relaxed from the previous level down.\n\nFor relaxation, the Flow Relation Scheme [Martinsen and Engedahl, 1987], which consist to\n\napply a relaxation time at the boundary in an extension of ten cells is used. The baroclinic\n\nforce is slowly active over 10 inertia periods. The biharmonic filter coefficients are set to\n\n1\u00d7107 m4 s-1 and 1\u00d7104 m4 s-1 for Levels 2 and 3, respectively.\nThe surface boundary condition is imposed using the high resolution results from\n\nthe WRF [Skamarock et al., 2008] with a spatial resolution of 5 km. These fields were\n\ninterpolated into hourly fields for the two last model domains using triangulation interpolation\n\nin space and linear interpolation in time. At the surface, the sensible and latent heat fluxes\n\nare calculated using the Bowen and Dalton laws, respectively [Chapra, 1997]. For the\n\nbottom boundary condition, a constant value of the bottom rugosity was considered. The 3D\n\nmomentum (zonal and meridional velocities), heat and salt balance equations are computed\n\nimplicitly in the vertical direction, while in the horizontal directions are computed explicitly.\n\nAs landward boundary condition (L3 grid), the freshwater input from Rias Baixas and\n\nthe Minho estuary outflow are considered. The Oitabe?n-Verdugo, Le?rez, Umia and Ulla\n\nRiver discharges were obtained from estimations presented by Otero et al. [2010]. The\n\nMinho estuarine outflow is imposed offline in L3. This outflow is computed by the Minho\n\nestuary model developed in this study, and directly imposed as momentum, water and mass\n\ndischarge to the coastal model.\n\n4.3.1.2 Configuration #2\n\nThe first domain (L1) (Figure 4.3) ranges from 12.60\u00b0W to 5.10\u00b0W and 34.38\u00b0N to\n\n45.00\u00b0N with a horizontal resolution of 0.06\u00b0 (? 6 km). This domain corresponds to the\n\nhttp://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/WOA09/pr_woa09.html\nhttp://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/WOA09/pr_woa09.html\n\n\n4.3 Model implementation 63\n\nFigure 4.3: The MOHID nesting system implemented for Configuration #2.\n\nPortuguese Coast Operational Modelling System (PCOMS) (http://forecast.maretec.\n\norg/) predictions [Mateus et al., 2012]. The system provides 3 days forecast of hourly\n\nocean currents, sea surface height, water temperature and salinity.\n\nThe vertical resolution comprises 50 vertical layers, where the top are 7 sigma\n\ncoordinate layers and the remaining 43 to the bottom are cartesian coordinates layers. The\n\nbathymetry is calculated by interpolation of the SRTM30 dataset. At the open boundary, the\n\nmodel downscales the solution of the General Circulation Model Mercator Ocean PSY2SV4.\n\nTidal forcing results from a 2D barotropic model domain with 0.06\u00b0 (? 6 km) of resolution\nforced only with the FES2004 tidal atlas solution, using a Blumberg and Kantha [1985]\n\nradiation scheme. The surface forcing is provided by MM5 regional and local atmospheric\n\nforecasting model, supported by Instituto Superior Te?cnico. The variables used are air\n\ntemperature, relative humidity, wind velocity at 10 m, solar radiation and downward long\n\nwave radiation. Bulk formulas are used to compute heat transfer between the atmosphere\n\nand the ocean.\n\nThe L2 and L3 have the same configuration as in Configuration #1 (Figure 4.3). The\n\nonly difference is that the L2 and L3 are forced at the open boundaries with salinity, water\n\ntemperature, three components of velocities and sea level from the father model (L1-\n\nPCOMS solution).\n\nhttp://forecast.maretec.org/\nhttp://forecast.maretec.org/\n\n\n64 Numerical model\n\n4.3.2 The Minho estuary model\n\nDue to the low depth (? 2 m) of Minho River estuary, the estuarine model was implemented\nin a 2D depth integrated mode. This procedure follows a methodology similar to that used\n\nby Vaz et al. [2007] for the Ria de Aveiro. In this configuration, a variable spatial step grid\n\nwas developed due to the geometry of the estuary, which is characterized by several sand\n\nbanks and islands. The grid has 119\u00d7100 cells, with dimensions of 100 m in the inner part\nof the estuary and 650 m (300 m in the direction y ) at the western boundary. The numerical\n\nbathymetry was interpolated from topo-hydrographic data measured by the Hydrographic\n\nInstitute of the Portuguese Navy in 1978/1989/1999 (Figure 4.4). The model is forced by\n\ntides at the offshore open boundary and by river flow at the upstream end of the Minho\n\nRiver estuary. Tidal forcing at the oceanic open boundary is specified using a global tidal\n\nmodel [Le Provost et al., 1998].\n\nThe Minho river freshwater input was supplied by the \u201dConfederacio?n Hidrogra?fica\n\ndel Min?o-Sil\u201d. At the ocean and river boundaries, the water temperature and salinity are\n\nconsidered fixed, with typical values for the season of the simulation. At the surface, heat\n\nfluxes were imposed, using latent and sensible heat fluxes parametrizations based on the\n\nDalton and Bowen laws, respectively [Chapra, 1997]. The meteorological data used for heat\n\nfluxes calculation were obtained from MeteoGalicia (www.meteogalicia.es). The time step\n\ndefined for this application is 10 s, the horizontal eddy viscosity is 10 m2 s-1, and a constant\n\nvalue of 0.0025 is assumed for bottom rugosity. Initial conditions for the hydrodynamic model\n\nare null free surface gradient and null velocity in all grid points. For the transport model the\n\ninitial conditions are constant values of salinity and water temperature.\n\nThe Minho estuarine model was developed to produce outflow properties\n\n(hydrodynamic and hydrographic variables) at the mouth of the estuary, as well as to\n\nmaintain the computational efficiency. This outflow was computed along the section shown\n\nin Figure 4.4 (red rectangle). Hourly discharges flow were determined using the velocity\n\nFigure 4.4: Minho estuary bathymetry with the location of the section (red rectangle) used\nto compute the Minho River outflow.\n\nwww.meteogalicia.es\n\n\n4.3 Model implementation 65\n\nmagnitude, depth and water level on the cells that define the section. The salinity and\n\nwater temperature along the section were determined by the mean value for these cells.\n\nThe outflow is imposed offline in the coastal nested models (Configurations #1 and #2).\n\nThis methodology presents clear advantages in the reproduction of the Minho estuary-\n\nocean interaction. Indeed, it takes into account the estuarine dynamics (e. g. tide and\n\nocean-atmosphere interaction) and not a river represented by a point source with a constant\n\noutflow.\n\n4.3.3 Comparison between Configurations #1 and #2\n\nAs it was previously mentioned, the Configurations #1 and #2 only differ in the source of\n\nthe initial forcing conditions, more specifically in the salinity and water temperature patterns.\n\nAs initial conditions, Configuration #1 uses Levitus climatology and the Configuration #2\n\nuses Mercator Open Global Solution as boundary conditions. In order to evaluate which\n\nconfiguration is more accurate in order to represent the Minho estuarine plume propagation,\n\nmodel results were compared with remote sensing data covering the region under analysis\n\nand in situ data collected close to the Ria de Vigo mouth. The comparison between\n\nConfigurations #1 and #2 was made for the period from January to March 2010. It was\n\nused six months and five days as spin-up for Configurations #1 and #2, respectively. The\n\nConfiguration #1 has a longer spin-up than Configuration #2, because it initializes with a\n\nclimatological solution, while Configuration #2 initializes with PCOMS model results. The\n\nspin-up is defined as the period after which each is considered that there is no significant\n\nspurious perturbation in the solution associated with the model initialization process [Leita?o\n\net al., 2005]. During these simulations the salinity and water temperature fields are\n\ngenerated. The initial conditions in the third nested model were interpolated from the\n\nprevious level.\n\nSST was obtained from Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)\n\n(http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/). MODIS is a key instrument comprising the Terra\n\n(EOS AM) and Aqua (EOS PM) satellites. The orbit is sun-synchronous, meaning that the\n\nsatellite always passes over a particular part of the Earth at about the same local time\n\neach day. MODIS Aqua always crosses the equator from south to north at about 1:30 PM\n\nlocal time. One of the instruments on Aqua, MODIS, measures 36 spectral frequencies\n\nof light reflected off the Earth in a 2300-kilometers wide swath along this orbit, so that\n\nMODIS measures almost the entire surface of the Earth every day. The measurements can\n\nonly be taken in ocean regions that are free of clouds. For the spatial comparison of the\n\nmodel results, predicted data (500 m) were interpolated for the satellite grid (1 km) using\n\na cubic interpolation. Figure 4.5 shows SST maps obtained from satellite data and model\n\npredictions for Configurations #1 and #2 for the L3 domain.\n\nhttp://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n\n\n66 Numerical model\n\nFigure 4.5: Sea surface temperature (\u00b0C) on 1 February 2010 obtained from satellite data\n(a), model predictions (Configurations #1 and #2) (b,c) and respective difference (d,e). The\ncomputed RMSE and bias between satellite and model data are also shown.\n\nIn general, both configurations show the same spatial pattern of the Minho estuarine\n\nplume. In Configuration #1, the area of propagation of the plume is very similar to the\n\nobservations (Figures 4.5a and 4.5b, black line), showing the same extension and water\n\ntemperature values. In this configuration, in front of Rias Baixas the water temperature\n\npattern (Figures 4.5a and 4.5b, black line) is also very well represented. On the other\n\nhand, the water temperature pattern offshore (Figures 4.5a and 4.5c, gray line) is better\n\nrepresented in Configuration #2.\n\nThe difference between satellite and model predicted SST and error analyses (RMSE\n\nand bias) were performed for both configurations. The RMSE and bias are also computed in\n\norder to quantify the difference between satellite and model data. In most of the region, the\n\ndifference distribution shows negative values in Configuration #1 (Figure 4.5d), meaning that\n\nthe model overestimates the SST (bias of -0.62 \u00b0C). However, the lowest values (close to\n\n\n\n4.3 Model implementation 67\n\nzero) are observed in the area of propagation of the plume and close to the coast, revealing\n\na good fit between predictions and satellite data. In Configuration #2 (Figure 4.5e) an\n\nunderestimation of the SST (bias of 0.62 \u00b0C) is observed in the entire region. However,\n\nConfiguration #1 (0.80 \u00b0C) has a RMSE slightly lower than the Configuration #2 (0.95 \u00b0C),\n\nshowing that the Configuration #1 represents better the main features of the surface water\n\ntemperature field in the region under analysis. This result is very similar to the one obtained\n\nby Leita?o et al. [2005] in the Algarve coast, revealing that the climatological solution is a\n\ngood alternative to obtain the ocean salinity and water temperature.\n\nRegarding the plume propagation, the configurations accuracy was also verified using\n\nsalinity and water temperature data on a buoy moored at C??es (44.16\u00b0N, 8.91\u00b0W, close to\n\nRia de Vigo mouth) (Figure 4.6).\n\nGenerally, according to the results presented in Figure 4.6, the predictions obtained by\n\nConfiguration #1 are more accurate for the salinity and water temperature. The bias (RMSE)\n\nfor the salinity is 0.12 (1.16) and 1.55 (1.92) in the Configurations #1 and #2, respectively\n\n(Figure 4.6a). For the water temperature, the RMSE for Configuration #1 is 0.65 \u00b0C, while\n\nfor Configuration #2 is 1.78 \u00b0C (Figure 4.6b). While the Configuration #1 results show a\n\nslightly warm (-0.47 \u00b0C) bias, the Configuration #2 results show a significant cold bias (1.72\n\n\u00b0C). These high errors values obtained in Configuration #2 may be related to the initial\n\nconditions differences [Mateus et al., 2012], showing that the climatological solution fits the\n\ndata better than the Mercator solution.\n\nConsidering the previous results, the Configuration #1 allows a better agreement\n\nwith the water temperature and salinity data in the area of propagation of the Minho\n\nestuarine plume. Thus, in the next chapters, this nesting numerical modelling methodology\n\nFigure 4.6: Observed and predicted (Configurations #1 and #2) salinity (a) and water\ntemperature (b) time series at C??es from 2 to 3 February, 2010.\n\n\n\n68 Numerical model\n\n(Configuration #1) will be used to study the evolution of the Minho estuarine plume, as well\n\nas its effect on the hydrography of the Rias Baixas.\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nModel application on Minho River\nplume intrusion into the Rias Baixas\n\n5.1 Introduction\n\nThe buoyancy generated by the Minho plume can flood the Rias Baixas for long periods,\n\nreversing the normal estuarine density gradients [Fiedler and Laurs, 1990; Alvarez et al.,\n\n2006], and motivating the research of its influence on these estuaries through several\n\nstudies [Mourino and Fraga, 1982; Alvarez et al., 2006]. Their results show that the plume\n\nintrusion can generate an important salinity decrease at the estuaries mouth, with the\n\nwater fresher than at the middle estuaries [Mourino and Fraga, 1982; Otero et al., 2013].\n\nConsequently, the plume intrusion reverses the normal circulation pattern, with near bed\n\nwater moving seawards and near surface water moving landwards, which tends to stop\n\nwater exchange between estuaries and shelf [Alvarez et al., 2006; deCastro et al., 2006a].\n\nIn addition, the nutrient salts, the oxygen, the chlorophyll and the phytoplankton patterns\n\ncan be modified suggesting the existence of blooms penetrating the Ria from the shelf,\n\nembedded in a water mass that is fresher than the estuarine one. According to deCastro\n\net al. [2006a] the effects of the Minho river freshwater intrusion in the Ria de Pontevedra are\n\ncharacterized by a peculiar pattern of nutrient salt and oxygen distribution. The nutrient salt\n\npatterns show a decrease of nitrate down to undetectable values in the photic layer, while\n\nthe oxygen distribution shows high oxygen saturation near the surface in the middle part of\n\nthe estuary. This pattern results from the surface water mass originated from the mixing of\n\ncoastal water and low-salinity nutrient-rich freshwater from the Minho River. Thus, the high\n\nconcentration of nutrients from the Minho River fertilized the external and middle estuary\n\nleading to the development of diatom blooms and resulting in an extra feeding source for\n\nthe main shellfish in the area. These studies show the relevance and need of the detailed\n\n\n\n70 Model application on Minho River plume intrusion into the Rias Baixas\n\nanalysis of the effects of the Minho River plume on the Galician estuaries.\n\nIn fact, this area is characterized by a high primary productivity mainly due to spring-\n\nsummer upwelling events that can support the high fishery and aquaculture yields in this\n\nregion [Tenore et al., 1995]. Indeed, the Galician area produces around 250000 tons of\n\nmussels per year, i.e., around 15% of the world production. Consequently, knowledge of\n\nfreshwater effects in these areas greatly facilitates the management of many exploited and\n\nprotected species. Due to the lack of continuous and simultaneous in situ measurements\n\nalong coastal estuaries as the Rias Baixas, the use of numerical models is therefore a\n\nreliable and useful tool to understand the complex structure of the oceanographic variables\n\nand circulation patterns that characterize these particular environments.\n\nThe present review of the literature showed that the Minho river plume influence inside\n\nthe western Galician estuaries has not been previously studied in detail, namely by means\n\nof numerical model applications specifically designed for this purpose. Thus, this chapter\n\naims to study the propagation and influence of Minho estuarine plume on the Rias Baixas\n\ncirculation and hydrography. Additionally, it describes the validation of a nesting numerical\n\nmodelling methodology (Configuration #1) developed to reproduce the propagation of the\n\nMinho estuarine plume towards the Rias Baixas, using a downscaling approach. In this\n\ncontext, the model ability to reproduce the Minho River plume intrusion into the Rias Baixas\n\nis analysed for the spring of 1998, since in this year was reported a high Minho River\n\ndischarge as well as favourable wind patterns to advect the river plume towards the Rias\n\nBaixas, inducing an inverse circulation [Alvarez et al., 2006]. Field data is compared to\n\nthe profiles predicted by the model in this situation to validate the model results. Finally,\n\nthe possible effect of this high discharge and wind on the Rias Baixas circulation and\n\nhydrography is also analysed.\n\n5.2 Methodology\n\n5.2.1 Model validation\n\nTwo sets of simulations were performed to validate the settings of the model in\n\nreproducing the evolution and fate of the estuarine plume originated from the Minho\n\nfreshwater discharge, using the initial and boundary conditions described in Section 4.3.1.1\n\n(Configuration #1). The first one was dedicated to evaluate the Minho estuary model\n\naccuracy and the second one to evaluate the coastal nested model including the Rias Baixas\n\n(L3) (Figure 5.1a) under a high Minho River discharge.\n\nThe sets of simulation of the Minho estuarine model covers the period between\n\nFebruary (model spin-up) and March 2006, and only the results of March 2006 were used\n\nfor the validation.\n\n\n\n5.2 Methodology 71\n\nFigure 5.1: Rias Baixas (a) and Minho estuary (b) bathymetries with indication of sampling\nstations position (red squares) and tide gauges (green diamonds). The n, s and i indices\ncorrespond to the northern mouth, southern mouth and inner-middle areas of the Rias,\nrespectively.\n\nThe model prediction skill for the Minho estuary is evaluated through a qualitative and\n\nquantitative comparison of the temporal evolution of predicted sea surface elevation (SSE),\n\nsalinity and water temperature and concurrent in situ data. First, a visual comparison\n\nbetween observed and predicted times series of SSE at Barra (41\u00b0 52.0\u2019N, 8\u00b0 51.2\u2019W),\n\nCaminha (41\u00b0 52.4\u2019N, 8\u00b0 50.5\u2019W) and Seixas (41\u00b0 54.0\u2019N, 8\u00b0 48.2\u2019W) (Figure 5.1b, red\n\nsquares) was done. Next, in order to quantify the model accuracy in reproducing in situ data,\n\nRMSE and predictive skill [Warner et al., 2005] at same stations are computed following the\n\nmethodology proposed by Sousa and Dias [2007] and Dias et al. [2009]. The comparison\n\nbetween harmonic constituents [Pawlowicz et al., 2002] computed from the model results\n\nand observations is another quantification method used to perform the evaluation of the\n\nmodel accuracy. This methodology was applied in this study, by comparing the harmonic\n\nconstants of the major tidal constituents in the Minho River estuary (M2, S2, K1 and O1) for\n\nthe stations shown in Figure 5.1b. Computed and observed salinity and water temperature\n\nwere also compared to evaluate the transport model accuracy. These comparisons were\n\nperformed at two locations (Figure 5.1b) inside the estuary.\n\nThe validation of L3 is performed in two steps: first, the propagation of the astronomical\n\ntidal wave is evaluated and second, the Minho estuarine plume dispersion is analysed over\n\nthe period 1-13 May 1998. This simulation was made for the period of November 1997 to\n\nMay 1998, and the first six months of the simulation are considered as spin-up.\n\nTo verify the accuracy of model predictions for the Rias Baixas (L3, Figure 5.1a),\n\nSSE outputs from a hydrodynamic simulation from 1 to 18 May 1998 are compared with\n\nsynthesized tides for Vigo (42\u00b0 14.4\u2019N, 8\u00b0 43.8\u2019W) and Villagarcia (42\u00b0 36.0\u2019N, 8\u00b0 46.2\u2019W)\n\n\n\n72 Model application on Minho River plume intrusion into the Rias Baixas\n\n(Figure 5.1a, green diamonds). The tide was synthesized from local tidal constituents. The\n\nRMSE, predictive skill and harmonic analysis are also computed.\n\nThe model ability to reproduce the pattern of the Minho estuarine plume dispersion is\n\nalso analysed, comparing SST horizontal fields and salinity vertical profiles predicted by the\n\nmodel with satellite measurements and results obtained by Alvarez et al. [2006] inside the\n\nRias Baixas. SST data was obtained by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer\n\n(AVHRR) sensors provided by the AVHRR/Pathfinder. SST daily data are available from\n\n1986 to 2006 with a high spatial resolution of 4.5 km. The in situ salinity data available was\n\nmeasured weekly at three sampling stations located at the southern (wider and deeper)\n\nand northern mouths, and in the inner-middle areas of the Rias de Vigo, Pontevedra\n\nand Arousa, during May 1998 (Figure 5.1a, red squares). These measurements were\n\nmade using conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) instruments (Seabird19 and 25). Salinity\n\ncalibration was previously performed by means of an \u201dAutosal\u201d salinometer. Regarding the\n\ncirculation pattern, the accuracy of the model is also analysed using current meter data\n\ntaken at the inner-middle part of the Ria de Pontevedra (42\u00b0 23.51\u2019N, 8\u00b0 44.29\u2019W) during\n\neight hours on 12-13 May 1998. Current velocity data was measured in situ by means of an\n\nElectromagnetic Current Meter (Valeport Model 808) at six different depths during 5 min at\n\neach depth. The same protocol was repeated every 30 minutes during a tidal cycle.\n\n5.2.2 Influence of Minho estuarine plume on Rias Baixas circulation and\nhydrography\n\nThe impact of the buoyant plume in the circulation and thermohaline patterns of Rias Baixas\n\nis also evaluated from 1 to 18 May 1998. Figure 5.2 shows the daily Minho River discharge\n\n(black line) and the meridional wind component at a point located close to the Minho River\n\nmouth (42\u00b0N, 9\u00b0W) for the period 19 April-17 May 1998. The river discharge shows an\n\natypical pattern with high values during early May (1600 m3 s-1; Figure 5.2a, black line).\n\nThe meridional wind component is variable, with strong fluctuations in direction and intensity.\n\nThe prevailing winds are from the north, with intensities higher than 5 m s-1.\n\nThus, in order to assess the individual effect of Minho outflow and wind forcing on\n\nthe establishment of negative circulation in Rias Baixas, two new simple simulations were\n\ndesigned, keeping most of the setups described in previous section, but changing the wind\n\nand river discharge characteristics. The first one was run considering essentially the wind\n\neffect, adopting a river discharge where the maximum values from 1 to 3 May were removed,\n\nand a constant average value (833 m3 s-1) between 30 April and 4 May was considered\n\n(Figure 5.2a, dashed gray line).

The predicted tidal elevations closely follow the observed records, revealing that the\n\nnumerical model reproduces the tidal propagation inside the estuary. The average RMSE\n\nand the predictive skill are 0.16 m and 0.96, respectively. These values are very similar to\n\nthose obtained in previous numerical modelling works for other estuaries, such as the Ria\n\n\n\n74 Model application on Minho River plume intrusion into the Rias Baixas\n\nFigure 5.3: Observed and predicted sea surface elevation time series at Barra, Caminha\nand Seixas.\n\nde Aveiro [Sousa and Dias, 2007; Vaz et al., 2009a] and the Ria Formosa [Dias et al., 2009],\n\nand show that the estuarine model accuracy is excellent.\n\nThe amplitudes and phases for M2, S2, K1 and O1 constituents at Barra, Caminha and\n\nSeixas are determined (Table 5.1) through harmonic analysis [Pawlowicz et al., 2002] of 30\n\ndays time series for both observed and predicted SSE.\n\nThe distributions of both observed and predicted amplitude and phase are very similar.\n\nThe tide is semi-diurnal with low diurnal inequality, with form number of about 0.08. At\n\nall stations, M2 presents the highest amplitude decreasing upstream. For this constituent,\n\nthe phase errors range from 9 to 30 min in Barra and Caminha, respectively (Table 5.1).\n\nThe model predictions for Barra are more accurate than for the remaining stations, with\n\namplitude errors of 0.06 m for both semidiurnal constituents. Both in amplitude and\n\nphase, the highest differences between model predictions and observed data correspond\n\nto Caminha and Seixas stations. These differences are due to bathymetric constraints that\n\nare more significant between Caminha and Vila Nova de Cerveira [Reis et al., 2009]. The\n\nresults for the diurnal constituents reveal a good agreement between model predictions and\n\nobservations, with average amplitude (phase) errors of about 10% (11.5\u00b0) and 17% (10.6\u00b0)\n\nfor the constituents K1 and O1, respectively. In summary, the harmonic analysis results\n\n\n\n5.3 Results and discussion 75\n\nTable 5.1: Harmonic analysis results comparison of observed and predicted sea surface\nelevation data for Barra, Caminha and Seixas (M2, S2, O1 and K1 constituents).\n\nTide gauge\nAmplitude (m) Phase (?)\n\nData Model Difference Data Model Difference\n\nM2\nBarra 0.98 1.04 -0.06 84.74 80.65 4.09\n\nCaminha 0.87 0.98 -0.11 95.62 80.94 14.68\nSeixas 0.72 0.84 -0.12 106.87 99.63 7.24\n\nS2\nBarra 0.43 0.49 -0.06 122.55 114.97 7.58\n\nCaminha 0.37 0.45 -0.08 137.91 116.30 21.61\nSeixas 0.26 0.36 -0.10 156.07 139.98 16.09\n\nO1\nBarra 0.05 0.06 -0.01 324.53 320.03 4.50\n\nCaminha 0.06 0.06 0.00 338.96 324.47 14.49\nSeixas 0.04 0.05 -0.01 325.60 341.11 -15.51\n\nK1\nBarra 0.05 0.05 0.00 64.17 79.17 -15.00\n\nCaminha 0.05 0.05 0.00 94.28 84.11 10.17\nSeixas 0.07 0.05 0.03 93.57 100.42 -6.85\n\nshow that the amplitude and phase of the major tidal constituents are well reproduced by\n\nthe model.\n\nThe water temperature and salinity predictions accuracy is also investigated at the\n\nMinho estuary. These variables can be strongly influenced by the freshwater discharge\n\nand the validation of the salt and heat transport becomes an interesting and challenging\n\nissue. Salinity and water temperature data sampled at Barra and Seixas during two tidal\n\ncycles was available for comparison with model predictions (Figure 5.4). This comparison\n\nshows that the model reproduces the variability of the thermohaline properties, with small\n\ndifferences in water temperature values. The maximum RMSE value was determined for\n\nBarra station, with a value of 0.89 \u00b0C, which represents about 30 % of the local water\n\ntemperature amplitude. For the salinity, the RMSE values are typically about 8% of the\n\nlocal salinity amplitude. According to these results is considered that the model reproduces\n\nthe heat and salt transport inside the Minho estuary and consequently was considered\n\nvalidated.\n\n5.3.1.2 Rias Baixas\n\nThe dataset used in the validation of the Rias Baixas model comprises harmonic constants\n\nof the main tidal constituents obtained at the mouth of the Rias Baixas (available from\n\nPuertos del Estado) and hydrographic parameters surveyed in the Rias during May 1998.\n\nIn Figure 5.5 the predicted and synthesized SSE at Vigo and Villagarcia stations are\n\nrepresented. In general, a good agreement between the predicted and synthesized SSE for\n\nboth stations is achieved, revealing the ability of the model to reproduce the data. The RMSE\n\nbetween computed and synthesized time series is 0.06 m and 0.05 m for Villagarcia and\n\nVigo stations, respectively. The predictive skills are close to 1 for both stations, confirming\n\n\n\n76 Model application on Minho River plume intrusion into the Rias Baixas\n\nFigure 5.4: Observed and predicted salinity and water temperature time series for Barra and\nSeixas.\n\nthe excellent agreement between both datasets.\n\nHarmonic analysis was also applied to predict SSE for Rias Baixas, to comparison\n\nwith the harmonic constants available from Puertos del Estado for the Villagarcia and Vigo.\n\nResults of the amplitude and phase of the harmonic constants M2, S2, O1 and K1 determined\n\nare presented in Table 5.2.\n\nThe agreement between predicted and observed values is very good both in amplitude\n\nand in phase for the semi-diurnal and diurnal constituents, which are the major tidal\n\nFigure 5.5: Model results and predicted sea surface elevation time series at Villagarcia and\nVigo.\n\n\n\n5.3 Results and discussion 77\n\nconstituents in the Rias Baixas and near coastal region [Marta-Almeida and Dubert, 2006;\n\nHerrera et al., 2008].\n\nFor the M2 constituent, whose amplitude is the largest, the difference between datasets\n\nis 0.01 m. In Villagarcia, the phase difference is 2.6\u00b0, which means an average delay\n\nbetween the observed and predicted tide of about 5.5 minutes for this constituent. For\n\nthe Vigo station, the average delay is lower (about 2.5 minutes), revealing a good phase\n\nagreement. For the diurnal constituents the amplitude and phase agreement may be\n\nconsidered good for both stations (about 0.01 m for amplitude and 10\u00b0 for phase in Vigo).\n\nThe results from the harmonic analysis show that the tide should be classified as semidiurnal\n\n(form number ? 0.07) and that semidiurnal constituents together determine about 90% of\nthe astronomic tide in Western Galician coast. This last result is in accordance with findings\n\nfrom previous studies [Marta-Almeida and Dubert, 2006; Herrera et al., 2008].\n\nThe wind and river runoff affects the dispersal of estuarine plumes, influencing the\n\ntransport and mixing of plume waters [Choi and Wilkin, 2007]. Thereby, it is important\n\nto evaluate the model accuracy to reproduce the Minho estuarine plume under different\n\nconditions.\n\nOne way of validating the accuracy of model results spatial variability consists in\n\ncomparing model predicted SST horizontal fields with satellite measurements. For the\n\nspatial comparison, model data were interpolated for the satellite grid (4.5 km) using a cubic\n\ninterpolation. The modeled SST is calculated by daily averaging the model predictions at\n\neach grid cell. Thus, Figure 5.6 shows SST patterns obtained from model predictions and\n\nsatellite data on 3 May 1998 (northerly winds, Figure 5.2b) and 11 May 1998 (southerly\n\nwinds, Figure 5.2b).\n\nThe results show that wind plays an important role in the dispersion of the Minho\n\nestuarine plume. When the wind blows southwards (Figure 5.6, upper panel), the main\n\nfeature is the offshore extension of the plume. Otherwise, northward wind (Figure 5.6, lower\n\npanel) spreads the river plume towards the Rias Baixas, confining it close to the coast.\n\nIn this case the plume reaches the mouth of the Ria de Pontevedra, influencing its inner\n\nTable 5.2: Harmonic analysis results comparison of observed and predicted sea surface\nelevation data for Villagarcia and Vigo (M2, S2, O1 and K1 constituents).\n\nTide gauge\nAmplitude (m) Phase (?)\n\nData Model Difference Data Model Difference\n\nM2\nVillagarcia 1.06 1.07 -0.01 83.07 80.47 2.60\n\nVigo 1.02 1.03 -0.01 80.25 79.06 1.19\n\nS2\nVillagarcia 0.44 0.41 0.03 100.89 97.32 3.57\n\nVigo 0.42 0.40 0.02 97.66 95.78 1.88\n\nO1\nVillagarcia 0.06 0.07 -0.01 323.22 323.59 -0.37\n\nVigo 0.06 0.07 -0.01 318.96 332.52 -13.56\n\nK1\nVillagarcia 0.05 0.08 -0.03 32.86 42.98 -10.12\n\nVigo 0.06 0.08 -0.02 47.87 42.60 5.27\n\n\n\n78 Model application on Minho River plume intrusion into the Rias Baixas\n\nFigure 5.6: Sea surface temperature maps obtained from satellite data, model predictions\nand respective difference on 3 May 1998 (upper panel) and 11 May 1998 (lower panel).\n\nphysical properties.\n\nBoth the measured and predicted SST patterns show approximately the expected main\n\nfeatures of the water temperature field in the region under analysis, which is characterized\n\nby higher temperatures offshore that decrease toward the coast (Figure 5.6).\n\nIn both periods there is a satisfactory agreement between the observations and\n\npredictions of the plume, although the adjustment quality tends to decrease offshore and\n\nclose to the river mouth (Figure 5.6, lower panel). More specifically, in the area of spread of\n\nthe plume it should be considered the existence of a small satellite land mask near shore\n\nand the satellite coarse resolution. These results are very similar to those obtained in\n\nprevious numerical modelling works [Otero and Ruiz-Villarreal, 2008; Marta-Almeida et al.,\n\n2012], revealing that the numerical model developed reproduces adequately the plume\n\npropagation.\n\nThe difference between satellite and model predicted SST was determined to evaluate\n\nand quantify the model accuracy (Figure 5.6). The difference distribution shows negative\n\nvalues in the northwestern Galician coast for both scenarios, meaning that the model\n\nunderestimates SST in this region. However, the lowest values (close to zero) are\n\n\n\n5.3 Results and discussion 79\n\nobserved in the area of spread of the plume, revealing a good fit between predictions and\n\nmeasurements in the reproduction of the estuarine plume. Nevertheless, it is necessary\n\nto keep in mind that the predicted water temperature is the average of the surface layer,\n\nwhose thickness is about 1 m, while the satellite data refers to the \u201dskin\u201d temperature.\n\nThe top ocean \u201dskin\u201d has approximately 0.01 mm or less, which may not represent the\n\nbulk temperature of the upper ocean layer due primarily to effects of solar surface heating,\n\nreflected radiation, as well as sensible heat loss and surface evaporation. All these factors\n\nmake it somewhat difficult to compare satellite data with predicted SST [Robinson, 2004].\n\nConsidering that the temperature measured by the satellite is usually lower, it is reasonable\n\nto assume that the model simulates adequately the thermodynamics of the top sea layer.\n\nThese differences between model and satellite data are consistent with values described in\n\nthe literature, where differences of the order of 1-1.5 \u00b0C are found.\n\nFigure 5.6 shows that when the wind blows from the south the Minho estuarine plume\n\nreaches the Rias Baixas. To investigate this freshwater intrusion, the salinity vertical profiles\n\npredicted by the model were compared with salinity measurements at the sampling stations\n\nshown in Figure 5.1a (Figure 5.7). According to Alvarez et al. [2006] the waters from the\n\nMinho River modulate an abnormal horizontal salinity gradient along the axis direction of\n\nthe Ria de Vigo and Pontevedra, corresponding to fresher water at the mouth of both Rias\n\nFigure 5.7: Observed and predicted salinity vertical profiles for the sampling stations shown\nin Figure 5.1.\n\n\n\n80 Model application on Minho River plume intrusion into the Rias Baixas\n\nthan at the inner-middle region. This situation contrasts with the typical salinity pattern,\n\ncorresponding to the normal Rias Baixas dynamics, with saltier water near the mouth.\n\nThe in situ salinity data reveals an abnormal salinity gradient along the axis direction\n\nfor the Rias de Vigo and Pontevedra. The southern mouths of the Rias are less saline than\n\nthe innner region, i.e. an inverse circulation is observed. This difference is more marked\n\nin the Ria de Vigo. On the contrary, the Ria de Arousa shows a different salinity gradient,\n\nbeing the water near the mouth saltier than in the inner part of the estuary, corresponding\n\nto the typical pattern of an estuarine system. A similar situation is observed in the model\n\npredictions. The increase in salinity from south to north shows that the low salinity values\n\nare not generated by the rivers inside the Rias, since the highest river runoff corresponds to\n\nthe Ria de Arousa (the northernmost one) [Alvarez et al., 2006].\n\nAnalysis of Figure 5.7 shows that the model overestimates salinity values in the\n\nsouthern mouth of the Ria de Vigo. Nonetheless, the halocline is well reproduced by the\n\nmodel for all stations, being predicted at the same depth.\n\nThe maxima RMSE values (1.27) between model predictions and measurements are\n\nobserved in the Ria de Vigo. For the other stations, RMSE values range from 0.15 to\n\n0.33. The bias was also determined, showing positive values for most of the stations, which\n\nindicate that the model predictions tend to overestimate in situ salinity. The highest biases\n\n(about -1.19) are also observed in the Ria de Vigo. These values can be explained by\n\nan improper prescription of the landward boundary condition or a malfunction of the CTD\n\ninstrument.\n\nThe observed and predicted along estuarine circulation in the inner-middle part of Ria\n\nde Pontevedra between 12 and 13 May 1998 is also shown in Figure 5.8. Both measured\n\nand predicted currents patterns show a negative estuarine circulation in the inner-middle\n\npart of Ria de Pontevedra (Figure 5.1), which is characterized by near surface water\n\nmoving landward and near bed water moving seaward, in accordance with previous findings\n\npresented by deCastro et al. [2004].\n\nIn general, the predictions reproduce the main features of the observed velocity vertical\n\nstructure, although the adjustment quality tends to decrease near the surface. The observed\n\nmaxima velocities are 0.10 m s-1 on the surface, while the predicted velocities are 0.06\n\nm s-1, meaning that the model underestimates the velocity in this region. No significant\n\ndifferences are observed near bed, showing a good agreement between predictions and\n\nmeasurements. It is important to note that, according to previous research in the area\n\n[deCastro et al., 2000], the wind effects inside the estuary may dominate the current at\n\nsurface layers, while bottom layers are mainly controlled by tide. Nevertheless, it should be\n\nconsidered that the wind field used in this implementation (5 km resolution) does not have\n\nenough resolution to properly solve the associated features of the estuary.\n\nAlthough the errors are not negligible, especially on the surface layers, the\n\nvalidation results show that the model developed in this study adequately reproduces the\n\n\n\n5.3 Results and discussion 81\n\nFigure 5.8: Observed (a) and predicted (b) along estuarine circulation (m s-1) in the inner-\nmiddle part of Ria de Pontevedra on 12-13 May 1998. Black line corresponds to 0 m s-1.\n\nhydrodynamic behaviour of the Rias Baixas. Therefore, the model is a useful and suitable\n\ntool to study of Rias Baixas circulation and hydrography, and in particular for the analysis of\n\nthe intrusion of the Minho estuarine plume in these coastal regions.\n\n5.3.2 Negative circulation in Rias Baixas\n\nThe model developed in this study was used to investigate the influence of Minho estuarine\n\nplume on the generation of the inverse circulation episodes in Rias Baixas, as the one\n\ndescribed by Alvarez et al. [2006]. These authors observed that high Minho River discharge\n\nand favourable southern winds spread the Minho river plume towards the Rias Baixas\n\naffecting thermohaline properties inside the estuaries on 12-13 May 1998.\n\nSurface salinity maps (Figure 5.9, top) predicted by the model show a northward spread\n\nof the Minho River plume reaching the Ria de Vigo on 11 May. During the following days\n\nthe northward displacement of the plume continued and the plume intrusion is observed in\n\nthe Ria de Pontevedra on 13-14 May. This situation generates an unusual surface salinity\n\npattern at these locations. The Rias Baixas normal salinity pattern is characterized by the\n\npresence of saltier water at the outer part of the estuary and freshwater at the middle-inner\n\npart. In contrast with this normal behavior, the existence of an important external freshwater\n\n\n\n82 Model application on Minho River plume intrusion into the Rias Baixas\n\nFigure 5.9: Evolution of surface salinity. Along estuarine circulation at stations located at\nmouths of Rias de Vigo (a), Pontevedra (b) and Arousa (c) between 10 and 15 May 1998.\nBlack line corresponds to 0 m s-1.\n\nsupply in an estuary can generate a reversal of the normal salinity and consequently a\n\nreversal of the normal estuarine circulation [Alvarez et al., 2006; deCastro et al., 2006a].\n\nThe along axis circulation at the mouth of Rias de Vigo, Pontevedra and Arousa\n\nis also calculated. Figure 5.9a corresponds to the current pattern at the Ria de Vigo\n\ncalculated from 10-16 May. Between 11 and 13 May, an unusual circulation (upstream\n\ncirculation) at the upper layers (up to 5-8 m) with water moving landward is observed, with\n\nthe highest velocities (0.30 m s-1) between 0-2 m. The presence of southwesterly winds\n\nduring this period favoured the reversal of the positive circulation resulting in the introduction\n\nof the Minho estuarine outflow into the Ria. Chao [1988b], Soares et al. [2007] and\n\nMarques et al. [2009] also observed that downwelling winds reverses the surface current,\n\nenhancing the mixing processes in their studies for La Plata River and Patos Lagoon. This\n\nreverse estuarine circulation may have some ecological consequences. It introduces the\n\n\n\n5.3 Results and discussion 83\n\ndinoflagellate blooms that are generated in coastal waters into the Rias [Fraga et al., 1988;\n\nSordo et al., 2001], thus decreasing the abundance of marine species in this area.\n\nThus, the surface current is mainly controlled by the plume intrusion while the tidal\n\neffect is only observed at the bottom layers. This pattern is in accordance with the results\n\nobtained for the Willapa Bay by Banas et al. [2004], where the Columbia River plume enters\n\nthe mouth at all depths under a strong tidal flow and the axial gradient can in fact reverse for\n\nsustained periods. These forcing conditions confines the Minho plume close to the coast,\n\nwhere a less saline region is developed, as found by Otero and Ruiz-Villarreal [2008].\n\nThe Ria de Pontevedra (Figure 5.9b) shows a similar circulation pattern although, in\n\nthis case, surface water moving landward is observed between 13-15 May. In addition,\n\nthis unusual circulation is more intense than for the Ria de Vigo with positive values of the\n\nalong axis current until 10 m. In fact, around 13-14 May it is also possible to see bottom\n\nwater moving seaward along one tidal cycle, which results in a negative estuarine circulation\n\nduring this period. The results also agree with those reported by Alvarez et al. [2006], who\n\nfound this negative estuarine circulation in a station located at the middle-inner estuary.\n\nTherefore, the existence of freshwater supplied from the Minho River could generate this\n\nunusual circulation, which tends to stop water exchange between this Ria and the shelf,\n\nincreasing the residence time and consequently changing water quality. This reversal poses\n\na selective force on the phytoplankton assemblage. Diatoms are unable to counteract under\n\nthese conditions and are therefore removed from the water column [Pitcher et al., 2010].\n\nOn the other hand, the high concentration of nutrients from the Minho River could fertilize\n\nthe external part of the estuary, resulting in an extra feeding source for the main shellfish in\n\nthe area [deCastro et al., 2006a]. Finally, the Ria de Arousa (Figure 5.9c) shows a normal\n\nestuarine circulation (outflow in the surface layer and inflow in the bottom layer) with the\n\nwhole water column following the tidal cycle, landward during flood and seaward during\n\nebb, without influence of the Minho estuarine plume.\n\n5.3.2.1 Minho outflow and wind effect on Rias Baixas negative circulation\n\nRiver discharge and wind are important in the modulation of the vertical and horizontal\n\nspreading of an estuarine plume. In fact, their temporal variability forces vertical and\n\nhorizontal mix between buoyant and coastal waters. As it can be observed in the previous\n\nresults, episodes of moderate-high river discharge combined with southern winds could\n\nresult in a plume with a northward direction, affecting coastal estuaries located north of\n\nthe river mouth, and reversing the normal estuarine circulation [Fiedler and Laurs, 1990;\n\nRoegner et al., 2002; Hickey and Banas, 2003]. The presence or absence of the plume may\n\nprovide an important environmental distinction between the estuaries as well as between\n\nnearshore coastal regions.\n\n\n\n84 Model application on Minho River plume intrusion into the Rias Baixas\n\nConsidering the results of the simulations described in section 5.2.2, for the first\n\nscenario (removing the high river discharge from 1 to 3 May), the obtained pattern (Figure\n\n5.10) is very similar to the simulation with real river discharge (Figure 5.9a) with no\n\nsignificant differences at the Rias Baixas mouth. Choi and Wilkin [2007] also demonstrated\n\nthrough numerical modelling a greatest similarity between a steady-low and high discharge\n\nevents in Hudson River mouth. These results show that the high Minho River discharge,\n\nobserved at the beginning of May, is not directly responsible for the abnormal hydrographic\n\npatterns found at the Rias Baixas, indicating that a continuous and moderate river discharge\n\n(500-1000 m3 s-1) may be enough to produce the negative circulation pattern.\n\nIn fact, using wind data provided by the NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis\n\n(CFSR; http://rda.ucar.edu/pub/cfsr.html) at a control station located near the mouth\n\nof the Minho River and river runoff data from 1979 to 2010 (period of available discharge\n\nfor the Minho River), a percentage analysis of events occurring under northward winds was\n\ncarried out (Table 5.3). It is found 27% of events at moderate river discharge (> 500 m3 s-1)\n\nunder northward wind conditions, showing the importance of studying these situations.\n\nWithout wind forcing (second scenario), the plume is displaced over the shelf, creating\n\na bulge in front of the river mouth during the first days. Then, the low salinity waters are\n\nFigure 5.10: Along estuarine circulation at station located at mouths of Ria de Vigo (a),\nPontevedra (b) and Arousa (c) between 10 and 15 May 1998, considering constant river\ndischarge.

In this situation, the plume effect is observed earlier (between 6-8\n\nMay) affecting only near surface layers, being surface currents weaker in this case than in\n\nthe real one (Figure 5.9a), which is consistent with the results by Marques et al. [2009] for\n\nthe Patos Lagoon. For the other Rias (Figures 5.11b and 5.11c), the classical estuarine\n\npattern is observed, showing that without wind forcing the Minho estuarine plume does not\n\ninfluence their circulation pattern. Therefore, southerly winds tend to mix the water column\n\nand to reverse the normal estuarine circulation.\n\nFigure 5.11: Along estuarine circulation at station located at mouths of Ria de Vigo (a),\nPontevedra (b) and Arousa (c) between 5 and 12 May 1998, considering no wind forcing.\nBlack line corresponds to 0 m s-1.\n\n\n\n86 Model application on Minho River plume intrusion into the Rias Baixas\n\n5.4 Conclusions\n\nThe present chapter aimed to validate the numerical model, and consequently to study\n\nthe propagation and influence of the Minho estuarine on Rias Baixas circulation and\n\nhydrography. The results obtained from this analysis indicate the following:\n\n\u2022 The nesting methodology adopted for the Minho estuary and the Rias Baixas\n\nwas successful implemented. Model predictions reproduce accurately the local\n\nhydrodynamics and thermohaline patterns.\n\n\u2022 Under certain conditions, the Minho River plume can reach the Rias Baixas and\n\nreverse Rias de Vigo and Pontevedra circulation patterns, while the circulation of Ria\n\nde Arousa remains unchanged. This situation was observed under northward winds\n\nand significant Minho River discharge. The freshwater intrusion of the Minho River into\n\nthese systems was the main responsible for the unusual horizontal salinity gradient\n\n(saltier water near the mouth than in the inner part) and negative circulation pattern\n\ncharacterized at these estuaries on previous research during May 1998.\n\n\u2022 The situation observed at the Rias Baixas at the beginning of May was not directly\n\ndependent only on the high Minho River discharge observed. Without wind forcing,\n\nthe Minho estuarine plume does not influence the circulation pattern on Rias Baixas.\n\nFurthermore, under northward winds, a continuous moderate Minho River discharge is\n\nenough to produce the negative circulation pattern, reducing the importance of specific\n\nevents of high runoff values.\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nInfluence of the Minho River plume\non the Rias Baixas\n\n6.1 Introduction\n\nThe interaction between local seasonal upwelling and estuarine plume intrusion drives the\n\nprimary productivity in the coastal region of Rias Baixas, supporting an intense raft culture\n\nof mussels [Blanton et al., 1987]. Moreover, the plume intrusion can generate an important\n\nsalinity decrease at the estuary mouth, reversing the normal circulation pattern. On the\n\nsurface, this reverse pattern is characterized by the intrusion of warm coastal waters, which\n\naccumulate within the Rias and finally flow towards the ocean through the bottom. Several\n\nworks were carried out to analyse changes in thermohaline variables, as salinity, inside the\n\nRias Baixas [Mourino and Fraga, 1982; deCastro et al., 2004; Alvarez et al., 2006; deCastro\n\net al., 2006a]. Some of these studies were performed under a high Minho river discharge\n\nand favourable wind in order to spread the river plume northward, toward the Galician coast.\n\nIn the previous chapter it was observed that under northward winds, a continuous moderate\n\nMinho River discharge is enough to produce the negative circulation pattern in Rias Baixas,\n\nreducing the importance of the existence of specific events of high estuarine (or river) runoff\n\nvalues. The Minho freshwater intrusion can give rise to both positive and negative effects\n\nfrom a biological point of view. It can generate an inverse estuarine circulation, which tends\n\nto stop the water exchange between the Rias and the adjacent shelf, increasing residence\n\ntime and hence affecting water quality. Conversely, extreme freshwater pulses can induce\n\nphytoplankton blooms at the shelf, which penetrates into the Rias embedded in a water\n\nmass that was fresher than the estuarine one, contributing to fertilize the area.\n\nAs it can be derived from the previous works [Garc??a-Berdeal et al., 2002; Choi and\n\nWilkin, 2007; Otero et al., 2008], local wind forcing and river discharges affects significantly\n\n\n\n88 Influence of the Minho River plume on the Rias Baixas\n\nthe dispersal of a river plume, namely its trajectory and vertical flux. Moreover, river\n\ndischarge also affects the location and magnitude of these physical processes. Thus,\n\nit becomes important to study the interaction of the wind and river discharge on the\n\nMinho estuarine plume propagation, in order to investigate the necessary conditions for the\n\nestablishment of the reverse circulation at Rias Baixas and also to evaluate water exchange\n\nand mixing between Rias Baixas.\n\nAdditional insight concerning plume intrusion and the nature of the water exchange\n\nbetween the Rias Baixas can be acquired by looking at particle tracking results. Lagrangian\n\ntransport constitutes a very useful tool to study the dispersion processes and also to predict\n\nthe fate of pollutants (e.g. oil spills accidents), allowing the analysis of particle fate through\n\nthe estimation of its trajectory. The use of particle tracking models in a complex system\n\nlike the Galician coast is very important, since the Rias Baixas are located along one of the\n\nmost important maritime routes and numerous merchant ships navigate through its water\n\nand even close to the coast. The frequent storms which affect the coast can provoke a\n\nlarger number of pollutant accidents, affecting the primary production. Therefore, insight of\n\nnon-dissolved particles dynamics allows the local scientist and managers to improve local\n\npolicies of ecosystem protection. In the previous chapter, the importance of the Minho River\n\nintrusion inside these Rias was analysed, indicating that the possibility of a spill near the\n\nriver mouth could seriously affect the whole area. Particles transport simulations related to\n\nthe plume dynamics have been performed worldwide [Whitney and Garvine, 2006; Banas\n\net al., 2009; Xia et al., 2011]. To study the response of the Minho estuarine plume dispersal\n\nto an idealized wind forcing during extreme river discharges conditions, several scenarios\n\nfrom weak-to-moderate winds are considered, blowing from each of the main four cardinal\n\npoints. Three different realistic scenarios of river discharge were chosen: low, moderate\n\nand high. A lagrangian particle model is also applied to simulate the transport of released\n\nparticles at Minho River mouth, in order to assess the water exchange and mixture between\n\nRias Baixas.\n\n6.2 Numerical experimental design: data and methods\n\nA statistical analysis of the maximum annual values of the Minho River discharge was\n\nperformed to characterize the extreme river discharge events. Estimation of the extreme\n\nevents is usually carried out by fitting observed data samples with a suitable probability\n\ndistribution. Thus, the monthly mean Minho River discharge (supplied by the \u201dConfederacio?n\n\nHidrogra?fica del Norte\u201d) from January 1971 to December 2010 is depicted in Figure 6.1a,\n\nshowing a typical pattern with high values during winter and low values during summer. The\n\nmaximum value corresponds to February (692 m3 s-1), and the minimum value is reached\n\nin August (121 m3 s-1).\n\n\n\n6.2 Numerical experimental design: data and methods 89\n\nFigure 6.1: Monthly mean Minho River discharge for the period January 1971 to December\n2010 (a). Minho River discharge scenarios (black line: high discharge; red line: moderate\ndischarge; blue line: low discharge) (b). Water flux (c), water temperature (d) and salinity\n(e) computed through the Minho estuary mouth for the three scenarios.\n\nThrough the analysis of Figure 6.1a, the mean maximum values occur in February.\n\nTherefore, the annual maxima of this month for Minho, Verdugo, Le?rez, Umia and Ulla\n\nrivers obtained from estimations presented in Otero et al. [2010] were adjusted to five\n\nprobability distributions. The empirical cumulative distribution function was computed\n\naccording to Kaplan and Meier [1958], while the theoretical distributions were determined by\n\ncalculating the location, scale and shape parameters of each annual maximum series. In this\n\nstudy, the following probability distributions were considered: Generalized Extreme Value\n\ndistribution (GEV), Gamma, Log-normal, Exponential and Weibull. The best distribution\n\n\n\n90 Influence of the Minho River plume on the Rias Baixas\n\nwas then selected by testing the quality of the fit using two statistical tests (Chi-squared\n\nand the Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests) at the 95% confidence level and the RMSE between the\n\ndischarges empirical cumulative distribution and each probability cumulative distributions.\n\nThe GEV distribution is the one that best fits the Minho river discharge, having the lowest\n\nRMSE value (0.03 m3 s-1). Otherwise, the Gamma and Log-normal distributions are the\n\nbest fits to the Verdugo, Le?rez, Umia and Ulla rivers. From these probability distributions, the\n\nmaxima discharges for non-exceedance probability of 0.05, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8 and 0.95 [Fortunato\n\net al., 2002] were calculated (Table 6.1). These calculations consist in the probability of\n\noccurrence of events that are equal to or less than a specific event. Thus, the results\n\nsuggest maximum (non-exceedance probability of 0.8) of 2108.2 m3 s-1, 64.0 m3 s-1, 70.9\n\nm3 s-1, 53.5 m3 s-1 and 229.8 m3 s-1for the Minho, Verdugo, Le?rez, Umia and Ulla rivers,\n\nrespectively (Table 6.1).\n\nTaking into account these discharge estimates, three scenarios were chosen (Figure\n\n6.1b). The first one considers an idealized high discharge, with an exponential shape for\n\nthe Minho river discharge starting from 692 m3 s-1 (an average discharge for February),\n\nincreasing to 2108.2 m3 s-1 (non-exceedance probability of 0.8) over 4 days and then\n\nremaining constant (Figure 6.1b, black line). As it can be observed in Figure 6.1b (black line),\n\nthe exponential beginning is one third of the maximum value, then the second (Figure 6.1b,\n\nred line) (moderate discharge) and third (Figure 6.1b, blue line) (low discharge) scenarios\n\nwere defined considering the same exponential shape, being the starting value one third\n\nof the discharge value for the non-exceedance probability of 0.2 and 0.5. Concerning\n\nthe others rivers, the discharges were kept constant, ranging from each non-exceedance\n\nprobability scenarios. These Minho River discharge scenarios were imposed in the Minho\n\nestuarine model, in order to produce outflow properties at the mouth of the Minho estuary.\n\nThese outflows (Figures 6.1c, 6.1d and 6.1e) were computed for each scenario and imposed\n\noffline in the coastal nested model.\n\nWind data provided by the NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR; http:\n\n//rda.ucar.edu/pub/cfsr.html) at a control station located near the mouth of the Minho\n\nRiver from 1979 to 2010 were used to characterize the wind speed over the area under\n\nstudy. The wind speed statistics reveal that the probability of winds lower than 3 m s-1 is\n\n32 % while the probability of moderate winds (between 3 and 6 m s-1) is very high (46 %).\n\nTable 6.1: River discharge estimations for February.\nNon-exceedance\n\nprobability\nRiver discharge (m3 s-1)\n\nMinho Verdugo Le?rez Umia Ulla\n0.05 237.6 20.0 45.8 14.6 61.0\n0.20 429.4 30.6 47.4 23.6 93.6\n0.50 873.6 45.3 49.1 36.5 146.7\n0.80 2108.2 64.0 70.9 53.5 229.8\n0.95 6274.6 86.1 92.7 73.9 352.8\n\nhttp://rda.ucar.edu/pub/cfsr.html\nhttp://rda.ucar.edu/pub/cfsr.html\n\n\n6.3 Results and Discussion 91\n\nThus, for the wind scenarios, these intensities were used as representative of the prevailing\n\nwind regime of this region.\n\nIn order to investigate the distribution and behaviour of the estuarine plume due to\n\nexternal forcing, several numerical experiments were conducted under various external\n\nforcing. More than 30 experiments to test the sensitivities of the plume model were\n\nsimulated, including 4 different wind directions (north, south, west and east); 2 different\n\nwind speeds (3 and 6 m s-1) and 3 different river discharges (high, moderate and low). All\n\nthe simulations run with six months spin-up, covering the period between August 2009 and\n\nMarch 2010, though only the results of February 2010 were considered for the analysis. The\n\nwind forcing starts on 5 February 2010, when the river discharge is at its maximum, and is\n\nthen held steady constant in all scenarios.\n\nAt the same time, in order to evaluate the horizontal pattern of plume dispersal, the\n\nequivalent depth of freshwater is evaluated by:\n\nFw =\n\n? ?\n?h\n\nSa ?S(z)\nSa\n\ndz (6.1)\n\nwhere Sa is a reference or ambient salinity, which represents the limit of the buoyant plume.\n\nFollowing Peliz et al. [2002] and Otero et al. [2008], it is used 35.6 as the reference salinity.\n\nS(z) is the salinity of the water column, ? is sea level and h is the bottom depth.\n\nTo identify the temporal and spatial variability of the freshwater transport and compare\n\nthe effect of the wind and discharge on plume dispersal, the freshwater transport in several\n\nsections of the Rias is also evaluated (Figure 6.2, sections II to IV). The freshwater transport,\n\nrelative to the reference salinity, Sa, is defined as the integral of the freshwater fraction:\n\nVFw =\n\n? ? ?\n?h\n\nSa ?S\nSa\n\nudzdx (6.2)\n\nwhere u is horizontal velocity normal to the section and the integral with respect to x is the\n\nhorizontal distance across the section [Choi and Wilkin, 2007]. The freshwater transport is\n\npositive in the direction of the flow.\n\nTo assess the water exchange and mixture between Rias Baixas, particles were\n\nreleased continuously close to the Minho river mouth (each simulation time step (15\n\nseconds)), starting 5 and ending 7 February 2010, with a total of 5782 releases. During\n\nthe next four days, the location of these particles was recorded half-hourly.\n\n6.3 Results and Discussion\n\nThe wind forcing and the river discharge play an important role in the dispersion at the\n\nMinho estuarine plume, reversing the circulation pattern in Rias Baixas. In this section,\n\n\n\n92 Influence of the Minho River plume on the Rias Baixas\n\nFigure 6.2: Map of Rias Baixas and location of the cross-sections.\n\na characterization of the Minho estuarine plume and the necessary conditions for the\n\nestablishment of this reverse circulation were investigated. Different river discharges (high,\n\nmoderate and low) as well as four scenarios of weak and moderate winds (3 and 6 m s-1)\n\nblowing from each of the main four compass points were simulated. The water exchange\n\nand mixture between Rias Baixas was also addressed. The details of their influence on Rias\n\nBaixas are included as follows.\n\n6.3.1 Characterization of Minho estuarine plume\n\nFirstly, changes in the vertical distribution of salinity and current along the section in front\n\nof Minho River mouth (Figure 6.2, section I) after 1 (day 5 in Figure 6.1b) and 4 (day 9 in\n\nFigure 6.1b) days of simulation under high river discharges (Figure 6.1b, black line) and\n\nconsidering different wind directions are shown in Figures 6.3 and 6.4, respectively.\n\nUnder no wind forcing (Figure 6.3a), the plume expands to the west. The plume\n\nbecomes about 16.5 km wide offshore, with a thickness of 3 m. The lowest salinity is\n\nabout 24, because new water joins the plume without being mixed downward by surface\n\nwinds. After 4 days (Figure 6.4a), the only difference is a greater dispersion of the\n\nplume on the surface layers. The northerly winds (Figure 6.3b) also contribute to spread\n\nthe plume offshore, tilting the isohalines toward the horizontal. These wind conditions\n\nenhance the upwelling process, spreading surface waters and intensifying the offshore\n\nvertical stratification (Figure 6.4b). Marques et al. [2009] also observed through numerical\n\nmodelling experiments that the influence of northerly winds contribute to increase the\n\n\n\n6.3 Results and Discussion 93\n\nFigure 6.3: Salinity and alongshore velocity (contours) along section I after 1 day under high\nriver discharges and several wind (6 m s-1) directions (no wind (a), north (b), south (c), west\n(d) and east (e). Black line corresponds to 0 m s-1.\n\nvertical stratification close to the Patos lagoon mouth. In contrast, southerly winds (Figure\n\n6.3c) accelerate the buoyant water along shore (north direction), tilting the isohalines toward\n\nthe vertical. After 4 days (Figure 6.4c), the plume width and its thickness decrease to 6.5\n\nkm and 4 m, respectively. The area of the plume has a salinity of 24 and is well mixed until\n\n5 m. This wind pattern enhances the mixing process within the plume, forming vertically\n\n\n\n94 Influence of the Minho River plume on the Rias Baixas\n\nFigure 6.4: Salinity and alongshore velocity (contours) along section I after 4 days under\nhigh river discharges and several wind (6 m s-1) directions (no wind (a), north (b), south (c),\nwest (d) and east (e). Black line corresponds to 0 m s-1.\n\nwell-mixed and narrow plumes [Soares et al., 2007]. The northward coastal current has a\n\nsurface speed of about 0.10 m s-1 along the salinity front.\n\nDuring westerly winds (Figure 6.3d), the plume is pushed to the coast and after 4 days\n\n(Figure 6.4d) it becomes about 23 km wide and 2.5 m thick. When the wind blows westward\n\n(Figures 6.3e and 6.4e), the plume expands about 16 km offshore, about as far the unforced\n\n\n\n6.3 Results and Discussion 95\n\nplume, though the halocline is deeper because of vertical mixing.\n\nNext, the evolution of the surface plume and current structure is analysed (Figures 6.5\n\nand 6.6).\n\nWithout wind forcing (Figures 6.5a, 6.5f, 6.6a and 6.5f), the plume expands offshore,\n\ncreating a bulge in front of the river mouth. The low salinity waters are advected to the\n\nright due to the Coriolis effect and after the establishment of the geostrophic balance, the\n\nplume water extends northward (along the coastline) [Takano, 1954a,b; Chao and Boicourt,\n\n1986; Zhang et al., 1987; Xia et al., 2007]. However, within 4 days (Figures 6.6a and 6.6f),\n\nthe plume arrival affects the salinity distribution of the Ria de Arousa and the area of the\n\nfreshwater plume is expanded offshore. These patterns suggest an approximation to the\n\nsurface-advected plume presented by Yankovsky and Chapman [1997].\n\nWhen the wind blows southwards (Figures 6.5b, 6.5g, 6.6b and 6.5g), the main feature\n\nis also the offshore extension of the plume due to the Ekman transport . This is related to the\n\ndevelopment of a surface southwestward flow plume. Otherwise, northward wind (Figures\n\n6.5c, 6.5h, 6.6c and 6.5h) spreads the river plume towards the Rias Baixas (to the north),\n\ncausing the coastal freshwater band to become more narrow and its thickness to increase\n\n(? 1.5 m). The northward flow along the coast and inside the Rias Baixas is stronger in this\nscenario (about 0.5 m s-1) than with any other wind condition, transporting freshwater to the\n\nRias Baixas. The plume reaches the mouth of the Rias de Vigo and Pontevedra after 1 day\n\n(Figures 6.5c and 6.5h) and influences the physical properties within the estuaries.\n\nEastward wind (Figures 6.5d, 6.5i, 6.6d and 6.6i) accumulates freshwater in Rias de\n\nVigo and Pontevedra, showing the importance of the wind direction parallel to the estuarine\n\naxis, as found by Choi and Wilkin [2007] in Hudson River. The surface current along the\n\nplume is weak (? 0.1 m s-1) relative to the northward wind condition (0.5 m s-1). Westward\nwind (Figures 6.5e, 6.5j, 6.6e and 6.5j) is more effective at pushing freshwater out of the\n\nmouth of the Minho River (? 13 km). The northwestward flow spreads the plume towards to\nnorth, but a small portion accumulates in front of the Rias Baixas mouth.\n\nIn general, the numerical results indicate that the horizontal distribution of the Minho\n\nestuarine plume is mainly due to the wind forcing, changing under the four different wind\n\ndirections. These results also indicate that the dynamic response of the Minho estuarine\n\nplume to the wind forcing takes less than 1 day, and that moderated wind conditions under\n\nhigh river discharge can reverse the circulation in Rias Baixas.\n\n6.3.1.1 Classification of Minho estuarine plume\n\nThe plumes as shown in the previous figures are defined as the surface-advected plumes\n\nby Yankovsky and Chapman [1997]. As a wind stress is applied to a buoyant plume, there\n\nwill come a point when the flow in the plume ceases to be driven by buoyancy and becomes\n\n\n\n96 Influence of the Minho River plume on the Rias Baixas\n\nF\nigure\n\n6.5:\nS\n\nurface\ncurrents\n\nand\nsalinity\n\n(top)\nand\n\nequivalent\ndepth\n\nof\nfreshw\n\nater\n(bottom\n\n)\nafter\n\n1\nday\n\nunder\nhigh\n\nriver\ndischarges\n\nand\nseveral\n\nw\nind\n\n(6\nm\n\ns\n-1)\n\ndirections\n(no\n\nw\nind\n\n(a,f),north\n(b,g),south\n\n(c,h),w\nest(d,i)\n\nand\neast(e,j)).\n\n\n\n6.3 Results and Discussion 97\n\nF\nig\n\nur\ne\n\n6.\n6:\n\nS\nur\n\nfa\nce\n\ncu\nrr\n\nen\nts\n\nan\nd\n\nsa\nlin\n\nity\n(t\n\nop\n)\n\nan\nd\n\neq\nui\n\nva\nle\n\nnt\nde\n\npt\nh\n\nof\nfr\n\nes\nhw\n\nat\ner\n\n(b\not\n\nto\nm\n\n)\naf\n\nte\nr\n\n4\nda\n\nys\nun\n\nde\nr\n\nhi\ngh\n\nri\nve\n\nr\ndi\n\nsc\nha\n\nrg\nes\n\nan\nd\n\nse\nve\n\nra\nl\n\nw\nin\n\nd\n(6\n\nm\ns-\n\n1\n)\n\ndi\nre\n\nct\nio\n\nns\n(n\n\no\nw\n\nin\nd\n\n(a\n,f)\n\n,n\nor\n\nth\n(b\n\n,g\n),\n\nso\nut\n\nh\n(c\n\n,h\n),\n\nw\nes\n\nt(\nd,\n\ni)\nan\n\nd\nea\n\nst\n(e\n\n,j)\n).\n\n\n\n98 Influence of the Minho River plume on the Rias Baixas\n\nheavily influenced by the wind stress [Garvine, 1995]. Here, the theories developed by\n\nYankovsky and Chapman [1997] and Whitney and Garvine [2005] are used to characterize\n\nthe Minho estuarine plume.\n\nTo predict the behaviour of the plume based on the inflow properties, the horizontal\n\nlength scaling parameter (ys) and the trapping depth of the plume (hb), which is considered\n\nthe depth which the plume remains attached to the bottom are applied:\n\nys =\n2(3g?h0 + v\n\n2\ni )\n\nf(2g?h0 + v\n2\ni )\n\n1\n2\n\n(6.3)\n\nhb =\n\n(\nLvih0f\n\ng?\n\n)1\n2\n\n(6.4)\n\nwhere h0 is the inflow depth (2 m), L is the inflow width (1 km), vi is the velocity of buoyant\n\ninflow as it enters the shelf, and the reduced gravity g\u2019 is given by:\n\ng? = g\n??\n\n?0\n(6.5)\n\nwhere ?\n?\n\nis the density anomaly.\n\nTo assess the wind impact to the plume shaping, the wind strength index introduced by\n\nWhitney and Garvine [2005] is also computed. The wind strength index (Ws) is defined as:\n\nWs =\nuwind\nudis\n\n(6.6)\n\nwhere,\n\nuwind =\n\n?\n?a\n?\n\nC10\nCDa\n\nU10 (6.7)\n\nudis =\n1\n\nk\n(2g\n\n?\nQf)\n\n1\n4 (6.8)\n\nwhere U10 is the wind velocity component at 10 m height (6 m s-1), C10 (1.2\u00d710-3) is the\nsurface drag coefficient and CDa (1.3\u00d710-3) is the depth averaged drag coefficient and k is\nthe internal Kelvin number. When |Ws| > 1, the flow is heavily influenced by the wind, and\nwhen |Ws| &lt;1, the flow is dominated by the buoyant forcing.\n\nFor high discharge scenario, the computed trapping depth (hb) and the predicted ys are\n\n0.6 m and 36 km, respectively. As hb &lt;h0, the bottom boundary layer has no significant\n\ninfluence on the buoyant plume transport and the Minho estuarine plume can be classified\n\nas surface-advected. In all directions, the Ws is greater than 1, which means that the\n\nMinho estuarine plume is heavily influenced by the wind. The Minho estuarine plume shows\n\ncomparable depth and offshore extension with the findings of Munchow and Garvine [1993]\n\nand Lentz and Largier [2006] for the plumes formed in Delaware estuary and Chesapeake\n\nbay.\n\n\n\n6.3 Results and Discussion 99\n\n6.3.2 Response of the estuarine plume to wind and river discharge\n\nAs it can be observed in Figures 6.5 and 6.6, under high discharge, the Minho estuarine\n\nplume reaches the Rias Baixas when the wind blows from the south and west. This could\n\nchange the hydrographic and circulation features of the Rias Baixas, turning this fact a\n\nchallenging and important study issue. Thus, in the following only results for these two wind\n\ndirections will be reported. To examine how this response differs with wind speed and river\n\ndischarge, northward and westward winds are blown with speeds of 3 and 6 m s-1 under\n\nhigh, moderate and low river discharges after 3 days (Figures 6.7, 6.8 and 6.9).\n\nIn general, salinity is lower and freshwater occupies a larger area as the river discharge\n\nincreases, which is consistent with a study on variation of plume size with river discharge\n\nperformed by Choi and Wilkin [2007] and Shi et al. [2010] for the Hudson River and for an\n\nidealized tidal estuary, respectively. The plume area decreases as the wind speed increases\n\nfrom 3 to 6 m s-1 due to enhanced surface mixing associated with increased wind speeds.\n\nIn the high discharge scenario (Figure 6.7), as a weak northward wind of 3 m\n\ns-1 (Figures 6.7a and 6.7e) blows during 3 days, freshwater reaches the Rias de Vigo,\n\nPontevedra and Arousa. When the wind increases to 6 m s-1(Figures 6.7c and 6.7g), the\n\nplume also reaches the Rias de Vigo, Pontevedra and Arousa. However, in this scenario the\n\nplume is more confined to the coast, presenting a higher surface velocity (? 0.30 m s-1). Xia\net al. [2007] also observed that the intensity of winds tend to reduce the surface plume size\n\nand distort the bulge shape due to enhanced wind-surface mixing. Eastward wind (Figures\n\n6.7b, 6.7f, 6.7d and 6.7h) exports freshwater from the estuary and favours the accumulation\n\nof freshwater in the recirculating bulge outside the mouth of Minho River. Apart of wind\n\nspeed, in these conditions, the plume only reaches the Rias de Vigo and Pontevedra.\n\nWhen the river discharge decreases (Figures 6.8 and 6.9), the patterns are very similar\n\nto the previous ones, only with differences in the plume influence area. For example, under\n\nlow river discharge conditions (Figure 6.9), the Minho estuarine plume does not reach Rias\n\nBaixas.\n\nThese results show that the wind stress and river discharge are the most important\n\nfactors determining the size and shape of the Minho estuarine plume.\n\nThe influence of wind forcing and river discharges on the freshwater transport in Rias\n\nBaixas (Figure 6.10) is illustrated showing the hourly volume transports determined through\n\nthe cross-sections in front of the Rias Baixas (Figure 6.2, sections II, III and IV).\n\nIn general, the freshwater transport is closely related to the river discharges, showing\n\nthe importance of river discharges in the dispersion of the Minho estuarine plume towards\n\nthe Rias Baixas. Indeed, the freshwater transport is also related to the wind and tide (the\n\nebb tide produces a decrease of the freshwater flux (outflow)).\n\nWhen the wind blows eastward during 2 days, an insignificant Minho estuarine influence\n\nis observed in Ria de Pontevedra (? 0.01 Sv) (Figure 6.10b), showing that this wind direction\n\n\n\n100 Influence of the Minho River plume on the Rias Baixas\n\nF\nigure\n\n6.7:\nS\n\nurface\nsalinity\n\n(top)\nand\n\nequivalentdepth\noffreshw\n\nater\n(bottom\n\n)\nafter\n\n3\ndays\n\nofnorthw\nard\n\n(a,e,c,g)\nand\n\neastw\nard\n\n(b,f,d,h)\nw\n\ninds\nof\n\n3\nand\n\n6\nm\n\ns\n-1\n\nunder\nhigh\n\nriver\ndischarges.\n\n\n\n6.3 Results and Discussion 101\n\nF\nig\n\nur\ne\n\n6.\n8:\n\nS\nur\n\nfa\nce\n\nsa\nlin\n\nity\n(t\n\nop\n)\n\nan\nd\n\neq\nui\n\nva\nle\n\nnt\nde\n\npt\nh\n\nof\nfr\n\nes\nhw\n\nat\ner\n\n(b\not\n\nto\nm\n\n)\naf\n\nte\nr\n\n3\nda\n\nys\nof\n\nno\nrt\n\nhw\nar\n\nd\n(a\n\n,e\n,c\n\n,g\n)\n\nan\nd\n\nea\nst\n\nw\nar\n\nd\n(b\n\n,f,\nd,\n\nh)\nw\n\nin\nds\n\nof\n3\n\nan\nd\n\n6\nm\n\ns-\n1\n\nun\nde\n\nr\nm\n\nod\ner\n\nat\ne\n\nri\nve\n\nr\ndi\n\nsc\nha\n\nrg\nes\n\n.\n\n\n\n102 Influence of the Minho River plume on the Rias Baixas\n\nF\nigure\n\n6.9:\nS\n\nurface\nsalinity\n\n(top)\nand\n\nequivalentdepth\noffreshw\n\nater\n(bottom\n\n)\nafter\n\n3\ndays\n\nofnorthw\nard\n\n(a,e,c,g)\nand\n\neastw\nard\n\n(b,f,d,h)\nw\n\ninds\nof\n\n3\nand\n\n6\nm\n\ns\n-1\n\nunder\nlow\n\nriver\ndischarges.\n\n\n\n6.3 Results and Discussion 103\n\nFigure 6.10: Freshwater transport in sections II, III and IV for high (a,b,c), moderate (d,e,f)\nand low (g,h,i) river discharges scenarios. Positive (negative) freshwater transport means\nfreshwater volume transport into (out of) the domain.\n\naffects with more intensity the Ria de Vigo during high discharge. Otherwise, northward\n\nwinds have positive freshwater flux (inflow) in all sections, indicating that eastwards currents\n\nbring water (on average) with a lower salinity than Sa (35.6). Conversely, when currents turn\n\nwestward the freshwater is transported to the east. When the winds blow with more intensity\n\n(6 m s-1), the freshwater is flushed into the sections more rapidly than with the wind speed\n\nof 3 m s-1.\n\nDuring the high discharge event, in Ria de Vigo (Figure 6.10a), on the first day a\n\nmaximum freshwater transport of 0.035 Sv is obtained, corresponding to the plume intrusion\n\n(Figure 6.5), which reduces to 0.02 Sv on the second day. During the following days, the\n\nnorthward displacement of the plume continued and the plume intrusion is observed in the\n\nRia de Pontevedra (Figure 6.10b) on 5.5-6 days and in the Ria de Arousa (Figure 6.10c)\n\non 7-8 days. It is worth noting that the freshwater transport for the Rias de Pontevedra and\n\nArousa is more intense than for the Ria de Vigo. This situation can be explained by the size\n\ndifference of the Rias (Ria de Arousa is considerably wider), since the freshwater transport\n\nis dependent on the area of the section.\n\nIn the moderate river discharge scenario (Figures 6.10d, 6.10e and 6.10f), the results\n\nshow that the southerly winds promote the introduction of the Minho estuarine outflow into\n\n\n\n104 Influence of the Minho River plume on the Rias Baixas\n\nthe Ria de Vigo and Pontevedra and lead to a small introduction in Ria de Arousa. In the\n\nlow river discharge scenario (Figures 6.10g, 6.10h and 6.10i), only in Ria de Vigo, a small\n\ninfluence of the Minho plume intrusion is observed (&lt;0.01 Sv) (Figure 6.10g), showing\n\nthat for these conditions, the Minho estuarine plume does not influence the Rias Baixas\n\ncirculation pattern.\n\nTaking into account the previous results, events of moderate-to-high river discharge\n\ncombined with southerly winds result in plume intrusion into the Rias Baixas. As it was\n\npreviously mentioned in Chapter 5, this plume intrusion can reverse the normal estuarine\n\ncirculation of these estuaries. Thus, in order to analyse the necessary conditions for the\n\nestablishment of the reverse circulation, the along axis circulation at the mouth of Rias de\n\nVigo, Pontevedra and Arousa is also computed (Figures 6.11, 6.12, 6.13 and 6.14).\n\nDuring the high river discharge scenarios (Figures 6.11 and 6.12), in the three\n\nestuaries, a negative estuarine circulation with near surface water moving landward (positive\n\nvalues) and near bed water moving seaward (negative values) is observed. However, this\n\nnegative estuarine circulation results in the propagation of the Minho outflow into the Rias.\n\nIn Ria de Vigo (Figure 6.12a), a negative estuarine circulation at surface layers is observed\n\nduring all period. When the weak winds blows northward, this pattern is observed in Ria de\n\nPontevedra from day 5.5 (Figure 6.11b), with the highest velocities (0.5 m s-1) between 0-10\n\nm. After 1.5 days, the plume intrusion effect is observed in Ria de Arousa (Figure 6.11c),\n\nwith velocities reaching 0.4 m s-1 in the upper layers. When the wind increases (Figure\n\n6.12), being the surface currents stronger (0.60 m s-1), the plume effect is observed earlier,\n\naffecting deeper layers.\n\nOver the moderate river discharge and both wind scenarios (Figures 6.13 and 6.14), the\n\nobtained patterns are very similar to the simulation with high discharge with no significant\n\ndifferences at the Ria de Vigo mouth (Figures 6.13a and 6.14a). The Ria de Pontevedra\n\n(Figures 6.13b and 6.14b) also shows a similar pattern although, in this scenario, the surface\n\nwater moving landward is observed later (day 7). In addition, this pattern is more intense\n\nthan for the high discharge scenario, with positive values of the along axis current until 20 m\n\n(wind of 6 m s-1), increasing in the plume influence area. The Ria de Arousa (Figures 6.13c\n\nand 6.14c) presents a normal estuarine circulation, with water moving landward during flood\n\nand moving seaward during ebb, for winds of 3 m s-1. Otherwise, for winds of 6 m s-1, the\n\nplume intrusion is also observed in Ria de Arousa after 3 days (Figure 6.14c), reversing the\n\ncirculation pattern.\n\nAccording to the results, different river discharges play an important role in the plume\n\nintrusion into the Rias Baixas. Under moderate freshwater outflow, the plume intrusion\n\nvelocity tends to be lower than with high river discharges, revealing a reduction of the\n\nstratification within the plume. However, the vertical plume area is larger (? 20 m) owing to\nthe increase of the water column stability.\n\nThe results presented in this section suggest that a moderate river discharge combined\n\n\n\n6.3 Results and Discussion 105\n\nFigure 6.11: Along estuarine circulation at stations located at mouths of Rias de Vigo (a),\nPontevedra (b) and Arousa (c), considering high river discharge and southerly winds of 3 m\ns-1.

Chao [1988b], Soares et al. [2007] and\n\nMarques et al. [2009] observed that southerly winds weakens and reverses the surface\n\ncurrent in their studies for La Plata River and Patos Lagoon, promoting the vertical mixing\n\nprocesses and destratification of the water column.\n\n6.3.3 Water exchange and mixture between Rias Baixas\n\nThe modelling results of the Lagrangian particles trajectories are depicted in Figure 6.15,\n\nshowing the position evolution and time since launch of particles released close to the Minho\n\nriver mouth during two days, under various forcing conditions. As the Minho estuarine plume\n\ncan be classified as a surface-advected-plume, the particles were released at the surface\n\nlayer.\n\nIn general, as would be expected, a pattern of younger particles close to the Minho\n\nriver mouth is observed and older particles are kept farther from it. During the entire\n\ntime period shown, the obtained model results represent the advection of individual water\n\nparcels, indicating that freshwater discharge and wind has a significant impact on the\n\ntransport of released particles, which relates to the plume intrusion discussed before. For\n\nexample, the surface plume has a relatively large size under weak wind forcing scenario\n\nand more particles move to the coastal ocean, floating far from the river mouth. This result\n\nis consistent with the findings obtained in the Columbia estuary plume studies [Banas et al.,\n\n2009].\n\nFor the high flow scenario (Figures 6.15a and 6.15d), the particles are advected\n\nnorthwards and confined close to the coast, corroborating the previous results. They are\n\nrapidly transported, reaching the Rias Baixas 1.5 days after being released. The particles\n\ntrajectory includes not only the Rias de Vigo, Pontevedra and Arousa, but also extends to\n\nthe Ria de Muros. Concerning the other freshwater outflow scenarios, the trajectories of the\n\nparticles are not so different from this situation, however there are interesting features that\n\nmust be pointed out. Under low-moderate flows and weak southerly winds (Figures 6.15b\n\nand 6.15c), the particles become limited to the Rias de Vigo and Pontevedra. However,\n\nwhen the wind increases (Figures 6.15e and 6.15f), particles are more tightly confined along\n\nthe coast and less will reach the coastal ocean due to the increase of the surface current\n\n(Figures 6.8 and 6.9). In addition, many particles are concentrated in Ria de Arousa where\n\nthe southerly winds in combination with the change in the coastline orientation hamper the\n\nnorthward displacement. The results reveal that the particles take longer (> 2 days) to reach\n\nthe Rias under the low freshwater condition.\n\n\n\n108 Influence of the Minho River plume on the Rias Baixas\n\nFigure 6.15: Trajectories and time since launch of particles released continuously close to\nthe Minho river mouth, considering different southerly winds and river discharges.\n\nTaking into account Figure 6.15, some particles that cross the Ria de Vigo mouth can\n\nturn way and cross the Rias de Pontevedra or Arousa. The fraction of particles arriving at\n\nRias de Vigo, Pontevedra and Arousa (Figure 6.16) is computed considering the sections\n\ndefined in Figure 6.2 (sections II, III and IV), in order to assess the water renovation and\n\nmixture between estuaries.\n\nOver high flow scenario and moderate southerly winds as shown, in Figures 6.16a,\n\n6.16b and 6.16c, about 38.5% of the particles released in the Minho River are transported to\n\nthe Ria de Vigo (Figure 6.16a) after 5 days, while 37.2% and 59.4% of the particles cross the\n\nRias de Pontevedra (Figure 6.16b) and Arousa (Figure 6.16c), respectively. Nevertheless,\n\nonly 20.4% and 40.5% of the particles that remain in Rias de Pontevedra and Arousa come\n\ndirectly from the Minho river. These results reveal that there is water exchange between the\n\ndifferent estuaries, hence each estuary cannot be considered independent. A similar trend\n\nis observed for weak winds , reaching 18.1%, 4.4% and 10.4% of the total particles in Rias\n\n\n\n6.3 Results and Discussion 109\n\nFigure 6.16: Fraction of particles released close to the Minho river mouth arriving at Rias de\nVigo (II), Pontevedra (III) and Arousa (IV) under high (a,b,c), moderate (d,e,f) and low (g,h,i)\nriver discharges scenarios. Dashed line corresponds to the particles that cross Rias mouth\ndirectly from Minho river.\n\nde Vigo, Pontevedra and Arousa, respectively.\n\nIn the Ria de Vigo (Figures 6.16a, 6.16d and 6.16g), no significance differences\n\nbetween river discharges and weak wind scenarios are found. The model results indicate\n\nthat as the river discharge values decrease, the fraction of particles inside the Rias de\n\nPontevedra (Figures 6.16b, 6.16e and 6.16h) and Arousa (Figures 6.16c, 6.16f and 6.16i)\n\nis reduced significantly. Consequently, as results of the lower surface currents, particles\n\nspread on a larger area, not being so confined to the coast. This pattern of particle transport\n\nis consistent with the previous conclusions that freshwater outflow and wind has important\n\neffects on material exchanges.\n\nAccording to these results, it is important to emphasize that the implementation of a\n\nparticle tracking model could reveal the significant impact that a continuous emission of\n\na certain pollutant may have, affecting the estuary and its neighbouring coastal ocean,\n\nturning this kind of applications a useful tool to marine scientists and managers. Another\n\ninteresting aspect of these results is the strong effects that wind stress has on particle\n\ndispersal, determining the mixing processes during extreme events in this coastal area.\n\n\n\n110 Influence of the Minho River plume on the Rias Baixas\n\n6.4 Conclusions\n\nThe main objective of this chapter was to investigate the necessary conditions for the\n\nestablishment of the reverse circulation pattern in the Rias Baixas and evaluate its impact\n\non Rias Baixas physical properties. Numerical experiments were conducted testing several\n\nscenarios with different river discharges, wind directions and intensity. The dispersion\n\nand potential pathways of particles released at the Minho river mouth was also assessed\n\naccording to the previous scenarios. The numerical results obtained from this analysis\n\nsuggest the following:\n\n\u2022 The dispersal of the Minho estuarine plume responds rapidly to wind variations and is\n\nalso influenced by the bathymetry and morphology of the coastline, being the Minho\n\nestuarine plume classified as a surface advected plume and heavily influenced by the\n\nwind.\n\n\u2022 Under high discharge events, without wind forcing, the plume expands offshore,\n\ncreating a bulge in front of the river mouth. Then, the low salinity waters are advected\n\nto the right due to the Coriolis effect and after the establishment of the geostrophic\n\nbalance, the plume water extends northward (along the coastline). When the wind\n\nblows southwards, the main feature is the offshore extension of the plume. Otherwise,\n\nnorthward wind spreads the river plume, towards the Rias Baixas. The plume is\n\nconfined close to the coast, reaching the mouth of the Ria de Vigo after 1.5 days\n\nand influences its hydrographic and circulation properties. Westward wind is more\n\neffective at pushing freshwater out of the mouth of the Minho River than any other\n\nwind condition.\n\n\u2022 The response of the Minho estuarine plume to the wind forcing takes less than 1\n\nday, and moderate wind conditions under high river discharge reverse the circulation\n\npattern in Rias Baixas.\n\n\u2022 The Minho River discharge and wind stress are the most important factors influencing\n\nthe size and shape of the Minho estuarine plume.\n\n\u2022 Under Minho River discharges higher than 800 m3 s-1 and southerly winds of 3 m s-1\n\nonly the Rias de Vigo and Pontevedra circulation patterns are reversed, while for wind\n\nspeed higher than 6 m s-1 the plume influence is also observed in Ria de Arousa. On\n\nthe other hand, independently of southerly wind speed, under Minho River discharges\n\nhigher than 2100 m3 s-1 the circulation patterns are reversed in all Rias Baixas.\n\n\n\n6.4 Conclusions 111\n\n\u2022 The presented particle tracking model was successfully coupled to the hydrodynamic\n\nmodel, giving an overview of the transport patterns along the Western Galician coast.\n\nThe freshwater discharge and wind has a significant impact on the transport of\n\nreleased particles.\n\n\u2022 Over a period of 5 days, under high river discharge and moderate southerly winds,\n\n38.5%, 37.2% and about 60% of the particles initially in Minho River are exported to\n\nthe Rias de Vigo, Pontevedra and Arousa, respectively. However, only about 20% and\n\n40% of the particles that remain in Rias de Pontevedra and Arousa come directly from\n\nthe Minho River, showing the water exchange between the different estuaries. This\n\nconfirms that the Rias Baixas cannot be considered as independent estuaries.\n\n\n\n112 Influence of the Minho River plume on the Rias Baixas\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nFinal conclusions\n\nThe general objective of this dissertation was to study the propagation of the Minho\n\nestuarine plume and its influence on Rias Baixas circulation and hydrography, and\n\nconsequently to develop and explore an innovative numerical model application, integrating\n\nestuarine and coastal models. With this purpose, two numerical models were implemented.\n\nThe first one is an estuarine model, comprising the whole Minho River estuary and the\n\nsecond one is a 3D baroclinic nested model for the NW Iberian Coast, including the adjacent\n\nRias Baixas. Whereas summary conclusions were presented at the end of each Chapter,\n\nan overview of the main results as well as some suggestions that need further research are\n\ngiven in this conclusion section.\n\nIn Chapter 2, the hydrographic features of the mouth of each Ria were evaluated. The\n\nRias Baixas are estuarine systems, that have in their downstream area a set of small islands\n\naffecting the circulation and hydrography patterns. Due to the existence of these islands, two\n\nmouths are considered for each Ria: northern and southern mouths. The results reveal that\n\nwhen comparing both mouths of each Ria, the water temperature is lower at the southern\n\nmouth than at the northern one. At the southern mouths, the influence of the upwelling and\n\nMinho River discharge is more intense, while at the northern mouths, due to its shallowness,\n\nthe air temperature acquires a major importance influencing the water temperature. A major\n\nconclusion of this Chapter is that the water temperature is weakly dependent on the Minho\n\nriver discharge and closely related to the air temperature pattern, and that the salinity is\n\nclosely related to wind variability and to the Minho River discharge. In fact, as in many\n\nestuarine and coastal environments, the water temperature follows a daily cycle similar to\n\nthe air temperature cycle.\n\nIn Chapter 3, an assessment of wind data was carried out, allowing to evaluate the\n\napplicability to study the dispersal of the Minho estuarine plume. Thus, a comparative\n\nanalysis between offshore QuikSCAT satellite and in situ land meteorological wind data\n\nwas performed. This comparison showed that the offshore wind from QuikSCAT represents\n\n\n\n114 Final conclusions\n\nadequately the wind patterns at land meteorological stations. The results of an weather\n\nforecast model (WRF) were also added in the previously study, since the numerical\n\nmodel used throughout this dissertation requires wind data with high spatial and temporal\n\nresolution close to the coast. The analysis reveals that the WRF model and QuikSCAT\n\nsatellite data are consistent tools to obtain representative wind data near the coast, showing\n\ngood results when comparing with in situ wind observations from oceanographic buoys. The\n\nresults showed that the wind speeds derived from QuikSCAT and the WRF model are similar\n\nalong the coast, with errors ranging from 1.5 m s-1 to 2 m s-1. However, QuikSCAT data\n\ntend to overestimate wind speed when compared to the buoys measurements. Regarding\n\nthe wind direction, the RMSE values are about 35\u00b0 for the stations under analysis. The\n\nbias presents a similar pattern between satellite and modelled data, with positive values\n\nat the western coast and negative values at the middle and northern coasts. The satellite\n\ndata always presents lower absolute values than the model results. A spatial comparison\n\nbetween QuikSCAT and WRF data was also performed over the whole Galician coast to\n\nevaluate the differences between the two datasets. This comparison showed that the\n\nmodelled wind speed tend to be lower than satellite winds over the entire domain, with\n\nthe highest RMSE and bias values found for the wind speed and direction observed near\n\nshoreline.\n\nDue to the near-coastal land contamination of satellite values and the lack of\n\nanemometers in the whole coastal region, the weather forecast model presents clear\n\nadvantages in the representation of the near-shore wind regime. Thus, the wind model\n\npredictions becomes a useful tool to analyse the Galician coast, helping to better understand\n\nthe wind induced phenomena which take place in this region. In fact, the accuracy of\n\nthe model predictions makes them suitable to perform the precise study of the physical\n\nprocesses driving several coastal phenomena. For example, the study of ocean chlorophyll-\n\na concentration distribution and evolution requires the knowledge of accurate wind fields,\n\nsince chlorophyll-a is highly sensitive to changes in wind forcing [Alvarez et al., 2012] and its\n\nseasonal variability is mainly related to upwelling events during spring and summer seasons.\n\nThe study of the dispersal of river plumes also needs the knowledge of accurate wind fields,\n\nsince estuarine plumes respond rapidly to wind variations, which determine the horizontal\n\nbuoyancy dispersal pattern [Choi and Wilkin, 2007; Otero et al., 2008; Vaz et al., 2009b].\n\nThe modelling task performed throughout this work began by assessing the\n\nconfiguration that better represents the Minho estuarine plume propagation (Chapter 4).Two\n\nnested configurations (Configurations #1 and #2) with three levels one-way nested grids\n\nand an estuarine model were implemented. The estuarine model runs offline and was\n\ndeveloped to reproduce the Minho estuary ocean-interaction. The used configurations only\n\ndiffered in the source of the initial forcing conditions. Both applications were designed\n\nusing the numerical model MOHID through a downscaling approach, with a three-level\n\none-way nested scheme. The first model domain includes the whole Iberian Peninsula\n\n\n\n115\n\ncoast, the second domain is a coarse representation of the Rias Baixas adjacent coastal\n\narea, while the third includes the same area with a higher resolution. All domains present\n\nrealistic coastline and bottom topography. The model results were evaluated against several\n\ndatabases of remote sensing covering the region under analysis and salinity and water\n\ntemperature in situ data collected close to the Ria de Vigo mouth. In the area of propagation\n\nof the Minho estuarine plume, the configuration that uses the Levitus climatology as initial\n\ncondition (Configuration #1) presented a better agreement with the in situ data. For the\n\nsalinity, the RMSE value is close to 1 and the bias is close to zero. The measured water\n\ntemperature is also well represented by the Configuration #1, with RMSE and bias values\n\nlower than 0.6 \u00b0C, revealing a good temporal representation of the hydrographic features of\n\nthis area.\n\nA good validation of the nesting model was achieved (Chapter 5), revealing the ability in\n\nreproducing the local hydrodynamics and thermohaline patterns over the Western Galician\n\ncoast. At the Minho estuary, the observed and predicted SSE follow a similar pattern, with\n\nan average RMSE around 0.20 m and a predictive skill close to 1. The modelled water\n\ntemperature pattern showed a maximum RMSE about 30% of the local water temperature\n\namplitude, while for salinity the RMSE value was about 8%, showing a good agreement with\n\nthe in situ data. Also, at the Rias Baixas, a good agreement between model predictions\n\nand in situ data was found. The observed and predicted SSE at both areas follow a similar\n\npattern, with an average RMSE around 0.06-0.20 m and the predictive skill close to 1.\n\nThe model predictions slightly overestimate salinity, with maximum RMSE values lower than\n\n1.27, whereas the lowest difference between SST model predictions and satellite data (close\n\nto zero) are observed in the plume propagation area.\n\nThe chosen period for the plume propagation model validation was the spring of 1998,\n\nbecause a high Minho River discharge was reported, as well as favourable wind patterns\n\nthat spread the river plume towards the Rias Baixas. The importance of the Minho River\n\ndischarge and the wind forcing in the event of May 1998 was studied considering two\n\nscenarios: one with a constant average discharge to evaluate the wind effects and the\n\nsecond removing the wind from 1 to 13 May 1998 to evaluate the river discharge effects.\n\nFrom the model results, it was found that a buoyancy intrusion (in the Rias Baixas) caused\n\nby the Minho River reverses the normal estuarine longitudinal gradient of salinity and the\n\nnormal estuarine circulation of the Rias de Vigo and Pontevedra. Moreover, a continuous\n\nmoderate Minho River discharge combined with northwards winds is enough to produce\n\nthe negative circulation pattern in Rias Baixas, reducing the importance of the existence of\n\nspecific events of high runoff values.\n\nThe characterization of the Minho estuarine plume and the necessary conditions (in\n\nterms of wind and river discharge) for the establishment of the reverse circulation pattern\n\nin Rias Baixas were investigated in Chapter 6. For this purpose, several scenarios with\n\ndifferent river discharges (low, moderate and high), wind directions (north, south, west\n\n\n\n116 Final conclusions\n\nand east) and intensity (3 and 6 m s-1) were created. According to the Yankovsky and\n\nChapman [1997] and Whitney and Garvine [2005] formulations, the Minho estuarine plume\n\nwas classified as a surface-advected plume and it is heavily influenced by the wind patterns.\n\nIn the moderate-to-high river discharge scenarios, the results revealed that the southerly\n\nwinds promote the introduction of the Minho estuarine outflow into the Rias de Vigo and\n\nPontevedra and lead to a small influence in Ria de Arousa. In the low river discharge\n\nscenario, a small influence of the Minho plume intrusion was observed in the Ria de Vigo,\n\nshowing that for these conditions, the Minho estuarine plume does not influence the Rias\n\nBaixas general circulation pattern.\n\nIndependently of the wind speed, the response of the Minho estuarine plume to\n\nthe wind forcing takes less than 1 day and a high estuarine discharge combined with\n\nsoutherly winds reverses the circulation pattern of all the Rias Baixas. However, a moderate\n\nriver discharge combined with weak southerly winds only reverse the Rias de Vigo and\n\nPontevedra circulation pattern, while for wind speed up to 6 m s-1 the plume influence is\n\nalso extended to the Ria de Arousa. This is an important feature, since, this negative\n\ncirculation tends to stop water exchange between the Rias and the shelf, increasing the\n\nresidence time and hence affecting water quality. On one hand, the high concentration of\n\nnutrients from the Minho River can induce phytoplankton blooms at the shelf, contributing as\n\nan extra feeding source for the main shellfish. One the other hand, the Rias Baixas are more\n\nsensitive to freshwater input because the water renewal is lower in these systems, affecting\n\nnegatively its ecology. The Rias Baixas are recognized as a privilege area of production of\n\nmarine species of great economical interest [Tenore et al., 1995], especially mussels. The\n\nexistence of this negative circulation affects the exchange between the Rias and the ocean,\n\nchanging the input of nutrients.\n\nIn order to better understand the surface transport of passive tracers, a particle tracking\n\nmodel was also implemented in Chapter 6. The Lagrangian model has proved to be an\n\nuseful tool for the study of dispersion phenomena along the Western Galician coast. It\n\nwas successfully coupled to the hydrodynamic model, allowing the tracking of the path of\n\nindividual particles released at Minho River mouth. The results of this application revealed\n\nthat in a time scale higher than 5 days, the particles released close to the Minho River mouth\n\nenter both in Rias de Vigo, Pontevedra and Arousa, revealing a high exchange rate between\n\nthem (? 20%). This confirms that the Rias Baixas cannot be considered as independent\nestuaries.\n\nOverall, the outcome of this work shows that the reverse circulation pattern observed\n\nin the Rias Baixas may be induced by a continuous moderate (> 800 m3 s-1) Minho\n\nriver discharge under northward winds. Due to the high frequency of these moderate\n\nriver discharge events, the methodology proposed in this dissertation produces sound and\n\nthorough results, and proved to be useful and accurate enough to simulate the dynamics of\n\nthe Minho estuarine plume along the Galician coast, as well as its effects on Rias Baixas.\n\n\n\n117\n\nThe results of this dissertation as well as the methodologies developed are unlikely to\n\nbe unique for the Rias Baixas and it is suggested that similar modelling approaches could\n\nbe replicated to other comparable systems, such as Spencer Gulf, Oregon Washington\n\ncoast, Upper Gulf of California or Patos Lagoon, to improve understanding and characterize\n\ncoupled estuarine-near coastal systems.\n\nAll the aims established at the beginning of the work were fulfilled and even surpassed.\n\nIt remains for the future several numerical improvements in the numerical model yet to be\n\nperformed. In particular, the implementation of a model with higher resolution inside the\n\nRias Baixas, allowing an accurate description of the local bathymetry. This implementation\n\nwill result in more accurate predictions of the circulation and hydrographic features of the\n\nRias Baixas. Also, it should be interesting to add to the model the coastal currents forcing\n\n(especially the IPC) to study its influence (or not) in the circulation in Rias Baixas.\n\nFuture research must also put an emphasis on the coupling between the hydrodynamic-\n\ntransport and ecological models, in order to understand the complex structure of the physical\n\nand water quality variables.With this methodology it will be possible to study and analyse\n\nthe upwelling formation as well as the interaction between the Rias Baixas, and to identify\n\nthe potential risk sources (e.g. decrease of the oxygen in water column or increase of\n\nthe freshwater input) than can threat the local aquaculture productivity. This ecological\n\nimplementation will allow to study the effects of the harmful algal blooms generated in the\n\ncoastal waters, which are introduced into the Rias Baixas at times of downwelling or through\n\nthe reverse of circulation patterns.\n\n\n\n118 Final conclusions\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAccadia C., Zecchetto S., Lavagnini A. and Speranza A.
