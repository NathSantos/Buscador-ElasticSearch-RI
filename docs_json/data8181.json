First, \n\nI would like to thank the guidance of Professor Paulo Nuno Vicente, his trust in me, his \n\nenthusiasm and support which he has always expressed, during this work project. \n\nIt was a good luck and I think it was in a good time to get to know the iNOVA Media \n\nLab team. Being surrounded by motivated and committed people it's a luck and an invaluable \n\nopportunity. \n\nI thank my colleagues, Ana Sofia Paiva and Carol Delmazo, for the meetings and \n\nbrainstorming that we have held together, since the beginning. It was very important and \n\nenriching to me having their motivation and friendship. \n\nI also want to express my thanks to all the people I met at XR Immersive Media \n\nmeetups and during iNOVA Media Lab meetings and training, because during those events \n\nit was a constant discovery that furthered my own curiosity. \n\nTo all my colleagues and professors of the MSc in Science Communication I want to \n\nthank, not only for the quality of teaching, but also for the sharing of experiences and critical \n\nopinions that have helped me to achieve this phase. \n\nProfessor Ant\u00f3nio Granado, I want to thank for your valuable contribution during \n\nthe proof of concept of this project. \n\nTo the direction of the Secondary School of Azambuja, Professor Madalena Tavares, \n\nI express my gratitude for her receptivity to my ideas and for the flexibility she has shown \n\nfor me, that made possible to test my project. Specifically, to Professor Edmundo Martins, I \n\nwant to thank him for his availability during the proof of concept. His willingness to see the \n\nproject concept replicated in a more continuous way is an excellent indicator and gives me \n\neven more strength to move forward. \n\nA big thank you to all the students who participated in this work, because without \n\nthem the project would not make any sense. Your voice is vital for everyone as we try to \n\nminimize the complex problems we face more and more. \n\nTo all my colleagues at Ajuda Botanical Garden, Plantar uma \u00c1rvore Association and \n\nQuinta do Z\u00e9 Pinto - ANPOC, I manifest my friendship. They are part of my history. \n\n\n\n \n \n\nI thank my trainers, M\u00f3nica Menezes and Ant\u00f3nio Pedro Santos, and all Cenjor's \n\ncolleagues, who during the Storytelling training listened to me many times and motivated me \n\nto follow in my dreams. \n\nTo my family and friends, who directly or indirectly helped me to go ahead, to believe \n\nin my convictions and potentialities, I express my thanks. A big hug to Nuno Peixoto for his \n\nsupport and patience. \n\nI am fortunate to have my parents for their love, for their unconditional support, \n\nand, even in most challenging phases, they have always been present, giving me \n\nencouragement to never give up on my goals. I feel grateful. \n\nFinally, I want to dedicate this work to the persons that, besides my parents, represent \n\na fundamental pillar for me, my grandparents. Grandmother Linda is still present and lately, \n\nwe often laughed together while I explained her the concept of my project. My grandmother \n\nis always attentive and curious. My lovely grandfather Horta has already left, but I am sure \n\nhe would be very happy with this my adventure. In the last years of his life I have often found \n\nhim re-reading his books about Chemistry and Algebra, his great passions. He was brilliant \n\nin those areas and was the person who most encouraged me, since the childhood, to observe \n\nand to interpret Nature, to love Science. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\nExploring Interactive Narrative for Science Communication: a design approach \n\nusing interactive documentary as a proposal \n\n XploreDesign4SciComm \n\n \n\nMaria Jo\u00e3o Horta Parreira \n\n \n\n Abstract \n\nThis study explores interactive narrative, manifested through multimodality in the \nformat of the interactive documentary (i-doc), as a proposal to science communication, in a \nspecific context. The oldest botanical garden in Portugal celebrates, in 2018, 250 years of \nexistence and is the scenario for that proposal. This choice was preponderant because the \nsubject to be communicated is in the ambit of Botany and Biodiversity Conservation and \npoint out the importance of citizenship in the mobilization of efforts that can minimize the \ncomplex problems and challenges associated with those fields. \n\n In science communication the format of the interactive documentary has been little \nexplored and in this sense this work has been developed to produce an original empirical \ncontribution that opens the way to new approaches in this sense. 360 video, virtual reality \nand augmented reality can be explored and remixed with traditional media trying to promote \nmore engagement of people with Botany and related sciences. Transdisciplinarity is a key \ncomponent of this project that aims to explore Design, not only in the several perspectives \nas a discipline, but also as a scientific area of extreme utility and that enables to build bridges \nbetween different areas.  \n\nArticulating storytelling, gaming and multimodality, one prototype was produced and \nits respective proof of concept was carried out in two classes: Biology and Geology students \nfrom regular secondary school and Journalism students from university level, and the \nrespective teachers were involved in the process. Action-research was applied in an original \nway that intends to add value to practical case studies, and plan targeted actions. \nBibliographic review, questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, participation observation \nand focus group were the used techniques to test and evaluate the inherent project concept. \nThe results obtained are favorable to the usefulness and viability of the idea and it will be \ninteresting to investigate in a more systematic way, to better understand opportunities in the \nintersection between science, technology and art. Emotions, cognition, and human-centered \ndesign are very interesting fields to investigate.  \n\nThe author argues that i-doc rather than being only a media or digital media channel, \nwhich represents reality, can be interpreted as a builder and enabler of knowledge. Besides i-\ndoc can facilitate the teaching and understanding of the curricular contents, the exploitation \nof i-doc can be also a great method to develop innovative contents that promote a \ndifferentiating journalism and that reinforce its social function, as this project proposed in \nenvironmental education. Another point of view suggested by the author, is that UX Design \nis essential to the planning of communicative relations between people, digital objects and \nreal life. At the present, with all the technological evolutions established more and more \nfaster, will be important to understand better how users interact, immerse and participate \nwith those evolutions. Digital and physical interactions are both essential, and the author \nintends to interconnect them, creating one digital object about Ajuda botanical garden, that \n\n\n\n \n \n\nmay promote the interest of users to visit it, physically, and be more awareness for its \nimportance. \n\n \n\nKey words: botanical gardens, citizenship, design, education, immersive journalism, \ninteractive documentary, science communication, transdisciplinarity. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n\nExploring Interactive Narrative for Science Communication: a design approach \n\nusing interactive documentary as a proposal \n\n XploreDesign4SciComm \n\n \n\nMaria Jo\u00e3o Horta Parreira \n\n \n\n Resumo \n\nEste estudo explora a narrativa interactiva utilizando a multimodalidade no formato \ndo document\u00e1rio interactivo (i-doc), que se materializa numa proposta para comunicar \nci\u00eancia, num contexto espec\u00edfico. O jardim bot\u00e2nico mais antigo de Portugal celebra, em \n2018, 250 anos de exist\u00eancia e \u00e9 o cen\u00e1rio dessa proposta. Essa escolha foi preponderante, \npois o assunto a ser comunicado \u00e9 no \u00e2mbito da Bot\u00e2nica e da Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o da \nBiodiversidade e salienta a import\u00e2ncia da cidadania na mobiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de esfor\u00e7os que possam \nminimizar os problemas complexos e os desafios associados a essas tem\u00e1ticas.  \n\nEm Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o de Ci\u00eancia, o formato i-doc tem sido pouco explorado e, nesse \nsentido, este trabalho pretende obter uma contribui\u00e7\u00e3o emp\u00edrica original que abra caminho \na novas abordagens, nesse sentido. V\u00eddeos 360, realidade virtual e realidade aumentada \npodem ser explorados e remixados com os meios tradicionais, com vista \u00e0 promo\u00e7\u00e3o de um \nmaior envolvimento das pessoas com a Bot\u00e2nica e ci\u00eancias relacionadas. A \ntransdisciplinaridade \u00e9 uma componente chave deste projecto que interpreta o Design, n\u00e3o \napenas nas diversas perspectivas como disciplina, mas tamb\u00e9m como uma \u00e1rea cient\u00edfica de \nextrema utilidade e que permite construir pontes entre diferentes \u00e1reas.  \n\nArticulando narrativa, jogos e multimodalidade, foi produzido um prot\u00f3tipo e \nrealizada a sua prova de conceito, em duas turmas: estudantes de Biologia e Geologia do \nensino secund\u00e1rio e estudantes de mestrado em Jornalismo e Novos Media, e os respectivos \nprofessores estiveram envolvidos no processo. A pesquisa-ac\u00e7\u00e3o foi aplicada de uma maneira \noriginal, pretendendo agregar valor a contextos pr\u00e1ticos e planear ac\u00e7\u00f5es direccionadas. A \nrevis\u00e3o bibliogr\u00e1fica, question\u00e1rios, entrevistas semiestruturadas, observa\u00e7\u00e3o participante e \nfocus group foram as t\u00e9cnicas utilizadas para testar e avaliar o conceito inerente ao projecto. \nOs resultados obtidos s\u00e3o favor\u00e1veis \u00e0 utilidade e viabilidade da ideia e ser\u00e1 interessante \ninvestigar de forma mais sistem\u00e1tica, para compreender melhor as oportunidades na \nintersec\u00e7\u00e3o entre ci\u00eancia, tecnologia e arte. As emo\u00e7\u00f5es, cogni\u00e7\u00e3o e design centrado no ser \nhumano s\u00e3o \u00e1reas de estudo muito interessantes para investigar.  \n\nO autor argumenta que o i-doc, em vez de ser apenas um canal ou um meio digital, \nque representa a realidade, pode ser interpretado como um construtor e um facilitador do \nconhecimento. Al\u00e9m de poder facilitar o ensino e a compreens\u00e3o dos conte\u00fados curriculares, \na explora\u00e7\u00e3o do i-doc tamb\u00e9m pode ser um m\u00e9todo muito \u00fatil para desenvolver conte\u00fados \ninovadores que promova um jornalismo diferenciador e reforce sua fun\u00e7\u00e3o social, como \u00e9 \nproposto na educa\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental. Outro ponto de vista sugerido pelo autor, \u00e9 que o UX \nDesign \u00e9 essencial para o planeamento das rela\u00e7\u00f5es comunicativas entre as pessoas, os \nobjectos digitais e a vida real. No presente, com todas as evolu\u00e7\u00f5es tecnol\u00f3gicas estabelecidas \ncada vez mais r\u00e1pidas, ser\u00e1 importante entender melhor como os utilizadores interagem, \nimergem e participam nos conte\u00fados, com todas essas evolu\u00e7\u00f5es. Interac\u00e7\u00f5es f\u00edsicas e digitais \ns\u00e3o essenciais, e este projecto pretende interlig\u00e1-las, criando um objecto digital sobre o jardim \n\n\n\n \n \n\nbot\u00e2nico da Ajuda, que possa promover o interesse dos utilizadores em visit\u00e1-lo \npessoalmente e uma maior consci\u00eancia da sua import\u00e2ncia e valoriza\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: cidadania, comunica\u00e7\u00e3o de ci\u00eancia, design, document\u00e1rio interactivo, \neduca\u00e7\u00e3o, jornalismo imersivo, jardins bot\u00e2nicos, transdisciplinaridade. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n\n \n \n1.

Introduction \n\n1.1 Context \n\nThe objective of this project is to build an active relational communication between \n\npeople, digital tools, techniques and practices where Design1 is a root language of the whole \n\nprocess to communicate science. The interactivity, participation and immersion are the \n\nengines that are explored, using interactive documentary (i-doc) as a tool to promote greater \n\nengagement of formal school\u2019s communities in issues such Botany, Botanical Gardens, \n\nBiodiversity\u00b4s Conservation and Citizenship.  \n\nThis exploratory study in science communication intersects science, art and \n\ntechnology, drawing on several studies. One of them, which is based on the topic of \n\ntransdisciplinary design, opens horizons for the social process of research in design, \n\neducation and practices (da Silva Vieira, 2018). Thus, it is intended to investigate the \n\npotentiality of design practice to other areas of human activity and the transfer of knowledge, \n\nbeyond the domain of design as a discipline. \n\nIntuition and the combustion of multiple ideas are a pillar of the whole process, not \n\nforgetting to balance the inherent limitations, competences and the refinement of reality to \n\nconsolidate the vision, mission and theory of social change involved in this project. Based \n\non different studies and approaches, are used multimodality, storytelling and gaming to \n\nrealize a demo-production of a hybrid i-doc, intersecting two specific arenas in the field of \n\nScience Communication: Science Education and Immersive Science Journalism, mediating \n\nbetween the text and the audiovisual formats. In an increasingly visual society, the demand \n\nfor new forms and technologies of communication has increased, where multimodal \n\nlanguage tends to become dominant and there is a growing need to study multimodality in \n\ndifferent areas, such as education, arts and other professional contexts (Vieira &amp; Silvestre, \n\n2015). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                           \n1 In this project, the term Design is used considering the Three Space Model (da Silva Vieira, 2018) and is \nbetter explained in the theoretical framework, with more detail and in the contextualized action \nassociated to the present research \n\n\n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n1.2 Motivation \n\nThe author of this work has an academic background in Agronomy Engineering and \n\nover the last 20 years she has worked in several areas, like pharmaceutical industry, \n\nagricultural services, marketing of organic farming products and, in education, teaching \n\nmathematics and natural sciences in basic and secondary levels, in formal and non-formal \n\ncontexts. In the last 5 years, her professional activity has been focused in environmental \n\neducation, with several types of audience, mainly school groups. She has been developing \n\nthese activities in different entities in Lisbon, which has been an enriching experience given \n\nthe complementarity of the actions, in the fields of: Conservation, Taxonomy and \n\nIdentification of Plant Species, Horticulture and Life Cycle of Food and in Forest \n\nManagement - Native Biodiversity and Conservation. She thinks that people have a genuine \n\ninterest in these topics, despite the lack of knowledge. People need to be involved in a more \n\ncontinuous and participative way, in contextualized actions, being urgent to explore new \n\ncommunication approaches, remixing new digital technologies within the traditional ones \n\nand researching new methods and practices, to improve the quality of communication\u00b4s \n\nscientific issues. \n\n Nowadays, she is studying science communication and wants to converge her \n\nexperience in this area, exploring interactive practices and technics that can engage and unify \n\npeople to achieve common goals. In the classes of Techniques and Practices in Science \n\nCommunication she was curious about the application of non-linear narratives and the \n\nformat of the interactive documentary as a communication tool. It was thus an impetus for \n\nthis work project along with the other seminaries attended during the master\u2019s course. Being \n\nable to turn problems in opportunities is a motivation that has been with her for a long time \n\nand so, she wants to stimulate an iterative and problem-solving approach process, in the field \n\nof environmental issues, where Design and Quality2 are key sources.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                           \n2 In this project, the term Quality can be understood in the first paragraph of this reference: \nhttps://explora.live/2017/11/24/featured-content/ and, in the scope of the last edition of the \nInternational Norm ISO/FDIS 9001:2015, Quality Management Systems \u2013 Requirements, with focus on the \nitem 8.3 \u2013 Design and development of products and services and the cycle PDCA \u2013 Plan, Do, Check, Act \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n1.3 Objectives \n\nBeing an initiative of social entrepreneurship, this project aims to find solutions or \n\nways that can minimize social problems, in the field of science communication. Promote \n\nenvironmental education at formal level education, focusing on the importance of botany \n\nand biodiversity\u00b4s conservation, and its communication, as vital pillars to welfare of society. \n\nThe logic is to explore languages and formats, involving various stakeholders and seeking to \n\ninvolve and empower the specific target audience for this subject: academic communities, \n\ninitially students of regular secondary education and university students of journalism. At \n\nthis point, is not intended to develop a final product but to give life to an iterative dynamic \n\nthat can improve a social transformation, with focus in education, in a long term.  \n\nThis research is exploratory and is devoted to the study and its application in \n\neducation experiences to promote engagement in Botany and related sciences.  The focus is \n\nto explore i-doc as a valuable tool to be used in contextualized classroom\u00b4s activities that can \n\npromote awareness to environment issues in the short term and be adapted with a long-term \n\nvision. Thinking about specific problems associated with science communication, more than \n\ntreating the symptoms is intended to investigate the causes trying to create conditions to \n\nbuild better communicational practices. In 2018, the oldest botanic garden in Portugal, Ajuda \n\nBotanical Garden (JBA), celebrates 250 years, despite it isn\u00b4t so well known by Portuguese \n\npeople, and so it is the main scenario to prototype one digital object, which simulates one \n\nhybrid i-doc.  \n\nIs intended to develop one concept that can be represented for one prototype, using \n\nthe genre interactive documentary that serves as a model for analysis and evaluation by two \n\ndifferent types of users: Biology and Geology students from secondary school and \n\nJournalism students from university level. The evaluation with the students occurs in natural \n\ncontext, inside one normal classroom ant the respective teachers are involved in the process. \n\nOn the other hand, a complementary objective is to celebrate JBA\u00b4s 250th \n\nanniversary, proposing to this scientific museum a new model of communication that can \n\ncontributes to its notoriety and a better recognition by citizens. A future challenge will be to \n\nestablish partnerships that enable the implementation of digital resources in JBA, with focus \n\non audiovisual formats, like 3600 formats (photos and video), virtual and augmented reality.  \n\nIn summary, this project has the following research objectives:  \n\n\u2022 To explore how to use i-doc to promote Botany and associated sciences in regular \n\nclassrooms.  \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\u2022 To promote teaching methods from traditional practices to inquiry-based \n\napproaches, using innovative tools and stimulating Responsible Research and \n\nInnovation (RRI).  \n\n\u2022 To provide moments of reflection, highlighting social capital (citizenship) as an \n\nimportant engine for the recovery/maintenance of memories that are part of our \n\nhistory and culture.  \n\n\u2022 To design innovative strategies to improve science communication, using a case \n\nstudy in JBA and testing the main idea in natural context (proof of concept). \n\n \n\n1.4 Research Questions \n\n \n\nMaking is one productive form of science teaching and learning that uses design, \n\nconstruction, testing and revision of a wide variety of objects, with technology and \n\nintegrating different disciplines as art, engineering and science and actually there is a huge \n\nneed to shift pedagogical strategies to support more reciprocal and less hierarchical ways of \n\ninvestigation (Bevan, 2017). Mainstreaming making and thinking can be a valuable proposal \n\nin that meaning. \u201cBut many questions remain and there is a need for further programme \n\ndevelopment, documentation, and research.\u201d (Bevan, 2017, p. 24). \n\nThis project uses one scientific theory - \u201cPlant Blindness\u201d3  - to promote one \n\nreflection and a call for action, in the context of classroom, to identify possible paths that \n\ncan promote citizenship as a pillar for raising awareness of key issues to the human species \n\nand ecosystems. \n\nThe research questions (RQ) to clarify with all the stakeholders, considering \u201cplant \n\nblindness\u201d a threat to combat, are: \n\n \n\nRQ1: Can the proposal for the multimedia hybrid be a valid medium to promote \n\nawareness for plant blindness and science education?  \n\nRQ2: What added value and constraints are created with multimedia hybrid format \n\nwhen addressing plant blindness, in the context of this project? \n\n                                                           \n3 Information available in:  \n\nhttp://www.conservationmagazine.org/2016/08/plant-blindness/ and \nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/284106711_Toward_a_Theory_of_Plant_Blindness/citations \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nRQ3: Does the observation of the hybrid contribute to inform and alert to the \n\nimportance of botanical gardens, particularly to the recognition of the JBA?  \n\nRQ4: What are the main causes of \u201cplant blindness\u201d and which effects it can cause, \n\nparticularly in the regular teaching of botany and associated sciences? \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n2. Theoretical Framework \n\n2.1 Science Communication: Challenges and Opportunities \n\n\u201cScience Communication\u201d is the broadest, inclusive and technical term that can be \n\nused in the context of all activities that intersect Science and Communication. Regardless of \n\nthe public considered, the context in which communication has place, the tools used and the \n\npurpose of that communication (Granado &amp; Malheiros, 2015). \n\nNowadays, science communication is suffering a deeply process of transformation \n\nand, has many citizens and policy makers get information about science mainly or even \n\nexclusively through the media, it will be vital to analyze recent trends and tensions and their \n\nimplications in those processes (Sch\u00e4fer, 2017). In the last 20 years a lot has been achieved \n\nin the promotion of scientific and technological culture in Portugal and even with limitations \n\narising from financial crises, both national and international, among other factors, people \n\nand institutions have been able to carry out this task, being essential at the present \"to try to \n\ndefine more clearly what, as a society, we expect and demand from science and technology, \n\nand, on the other hand, what the scientific community considers useful, possible and \n\ndesirable \" (Granado &amp; Malheiros, 2015). \n\nThe expression \u201cto understand the future, you have to look back at least twice as far \n\nas you\u2019re looking ahead\u201d, from Institute for the Future (IFTF), is useful at the present if we \n\nwant to build solid paths with a long-term vision (McGonigal, 2011). \n\nIn Portugal, the troubled history between the National Museum of Natural History \n\nand Science and the academic entities is remarkable but, in the last decades, since the \n\ndemocratization of the country, was possible to activate an internal reorganization and \n\nidentification of the educational, cultural and social mission of this space, which is at the \n\npresent in a \"phase of great dynamism in science communication, in the identification and \n\nprotection of the natural heritage, in the promotion of an environmental conscience\" \n\n(P\u00f3voas, Lopes, Melo, Correia, &amp; Alves, 2016).  Scientific museums can be understood as \"a \n\nwide range of institutions dedicated to showing science through exhibitions, which include \n\nmuseums and science centers, natural history museums, botanical gardens and zoos\" \n\n(Delicado, 2013). In the vast field of Science Communication, many concepts are used as \n\nscientific literacy, scientific culture, public understanding of science (PUS), public \n\nengagement in science and technology (PEST), among others and, although related, each \n\none delimits a potential field of research. PEST is a concept that empowers research in \n\nrelationships among various social actors and manifests a focus of action: \"it places the \n\nemphasis of communication on a relationship between equal citizens, whose knowledge and \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nhopes have equal dignities, whose opinions must be respected, in a true dialogue between \n\nspecialists and common people instead of a lesson where some speak and others just listen.\" \n\n(Granado &amp; Malheiros, 2015). \n\nIn the context of science communication, social semiotic is an useful studying area \n\nin the clarification of opportunities in the resources used, especially when using various types \n\nof language and modes of representation: mediation between text and audiovisual as an \n\nessentially qualitative and dynamic methodological proposal, is an interesting way to explore \n\nin the study of the effectiveness of media, involving the main actors in the communication \n\nprocess, producers and consumers of scientific knowledge (Pinto &amp; Zagalo, 2016). In an \n\nincreasingly visual world, where audiovisual content proliferates, teaching and \n\ncommunication through moving images is more and more important for educators and \n\nacademics in all areas (Eriksson &amp; S\u00f8rensen, 2012). \n\nIn relation to Botany, two researchers, Wandersse and Schussler, created the term \n\n\"botanical blindness\" in 1998, after several years of study on the perception of the public \n\nabout plants4. This theory defends a botanical neglect on the part of the society, that is \n\nanalyzed by Salatino and Buckeridge (2016) in a work whose title is: \u201cDe que te serve saber \n\nBot\u00e2nica?\u201d (a possible translation: \"But why is good for you to know Botany?\"). In this \n\ncontext, those researchers point out several reasons for this reality, not only in Brazil but \n\nelsewhere in the world, showing a vicious cycle in several fields of action, where the school \n\n(at various levels of education) and the media stand out: \n\n \n\n\u201c(\u2026) Media have enormous influence in molding society's trends and behaviors. The \n\npotential of the media as complementary agents to the actions of parents and teachers in the \n\nscientific training of the people is undeniable. Educational programs can make a substantial \n\ncontribution to mitigating the effects of botanical blindness. Unfortunately, most journal \n\narticles and videos of scientific nature have been characterized by zoocentric attitudes. Even \n\nhigh-profile and respectable media productions, such as the BBC, are included in this group. \n\n(\u2026)\u201d (Salatino &amp; Buckeridge, 2016, p. 190) \n\n \n\nIn a time of great changes and convergence of the media, it is imperative to explore \n\nand experiment new languages, formats and practices that foster one of the major objectives \n\nof the Science Communication: to reach and engage audiences through resources and \n\n                                                           \n4 Available in: http://www.jstor.org/stable/4450624?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\nstrategies that promote greater involvement and responsibility. The interest in Botany and \n\nrelated sciences can be enhanced with innovative formats that promote the stimulation of \n\nthe senses and the motivation for discovery. \n\nDigital storytelling is a multimedia practice that, with multimodality, manifests \n\ncomplexity not only at the production level but also in the final interpretation, in the \n\nconsumption of these formats: the interaction between the different modes of representation \n\nof the stories (such as text, images, sounds) is preponderant in the conception and delineation \n\nof storytelling, as well as in the understanding of the effects produced on the consumers, \n\nwho are not just recipients of information but participants in the construction of narratives \n\n(Alonso, Molina, &amp; Requejo, 2013). With the adoption of Web 2.0 tools in the scientific field, \n\nthe ability to communicate effectively is even more a vital competency, since along with the \n\ninherent advantages of a participatory culture and technological convergence, new challenges \n\nalso arise and even threats, such as the legitimacy and quality of science (Azevedo &amp; \n\nMoutinho, 2014). These authors warned of some implications of the explosion of content \n\nthat has been generated by people on the Web and that contribute to the change of habits \n\nand expectations: \"The boundary between amateur and professional researcher will blur and \n\nthe number of traditionally scientific authors and extra-institutional authors who claim the \n\nscientific status of their work will grow.\" In the future scenario of science, as we predict here, \n\nscientific production can easily be reviewed, evaluated, voted upon and commented upon by \n\nvirtually everyone. \" (Azevedo &amp; Moutinho, 2014, p. 4). The same authors quote Henry \n\nJenkins about the phrase with which he begins the introduction of his book \u201cCultura da \n\nConverg\u00eancia\u201d (Convergence Culture): \"Welcome to the culture of convergence, where old \n\nand new media collide, where the corporate media and alternative media, where the power \n\nof the media producer and the power of the consumer interact in unpredictable ways. \" \n\n(Azevedo &amp; Moutinho, 2014, p. 2). Recently, Sir Tim Berners-Lee shared his vision for the \n\nfuture of the web and how it will achieve its true potential in the service of humanity, along \n\nwith the growing threats in recent years, highlighting three main trends which must be \n\ntackled: loss of control of personal data, ease of disseminating fake news on the web and \n\npolitical advertising online with little transparency (\"Three challenges for the web, according \n\nto its inventor,\" 2017). \n\nConsidering the advantages associated with the online presence of scientists and \n\nresearchers, a recent study evidenced the difference between online presence and use of \n\nsocial networks (having a social network profile does not necessarily mean being present) \n\nand showed some skepticism in the use of social networks by researchers, which will be \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\ninteresting to analyze in a perspective of new approaches (Greifeneder, Pontis, Blandford, \n\nAttalla, &amp; Neal, 2017). \u201cCitizen science is the engagement of the public in science or \n\nmonitoring to address real world problems. Citizen science programs have the ability to \n\nprovide excellent data for researchers at large spatial and temporal scales.\u201d (Traynor, Lee, &amp; \n\nDuke, 2017, pp. 740, Abstract). Thinking about the quality and credibility of science \n\ncommunication and public debate one important issue appears \u2013 democracy in science \u2013 and \n\none interesting fact is that very little has been explored to choose, adapt and evaluate \n\ninformation for specific contexts and public\u00b4s needs, instead, a lot of efforts have been \n\ndeveloped to limit the circulation or even censoring some contents, as the case of the Italian \n\nimmunologist who promoted one debate about vaccination in 2016 through his own \n\nFacebook page and canceled later all comments by claiming: \u201cHere only those who have \n\nstudied can comment, not the common citizen. Science is not democratic.\u201d (Bucchi, 2017). \n\nIn the Meeting with Science and Technology in Portugal 2017, Heitor Alvelos, \n\ndirector of ID+ Research Institute for Design, Media and Culture from the University of \n\nPorto (School of Fine Arts), informs about the 2 main missions of his research group: the \n\nre-registration and re-calibration of traditional media, often considered obsolete, that \n\nthrough design can re-assume an important role and, on the other hand, the critical \n\ninterpretation of the impact of new media, especially digital, on the social, cultural and \n\neconomic health of our society. Also, highlights the strong link between design and \n\ncommunication, focusing on the audiovisual sector, and reinforces the need for greater \n\nvisibility and recognition of design as a scientific territory, exploring and establishing bridges \n\nbetween different areas.5 Design-based approaches offer a range of potentialities and \n\ninterfaces for innovative actions, especially in the interconnection of Design and Education, \n\npromoting engagement in sustainability and pro-environmental behavior among young \n\nstudents (Mouchrek, 2017). In one recent PhD dissertation was studied Design as a planner \n\nfor communicative relationships between things and people and the possible interpretive \n\nactions of the utility of things, to facilitate the planning and implementation of useful artifacts \n\nto people in various contexts (Mi\u00f1ana, 2017). The concept STEAM can be seen as the \n\nevolution from STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) by the \n\nintegration of Arts, but, in a deeply sense the acronym STEAM is related to \n\ninterdisciplinarity, creativity, authentic or real-world learning and project-centered thinking, \n\nwhere Design Thinking is vital to support an expanded view of STEAM experiences, in \n\n                                                           \n5 Available in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vPXiYHVDOM \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\nparticularly in education contexts, promoting creative thinking, collaboration, student \n\nownership and responsibility of their learning (Henriksen, 2017). \n\n\u201c(\u2026) We argue that the science communication community should take active steps \n\nto integrate with the science education community and provide practical, facilitative support \n\nfor its counterpart, especially in primary and secondary school education. The more support, \n\nand the sooner it is delivered, the better. If the two communities are to achieve their mutual \n\nobjectives, we should make full use of science education as a main channel for the \n\nimprovement of public scientific literacy and the continued construction of scientific culture. \n\n(\u2026)\u201d (Donghong, 2008, p. 152) \n\n \u201c(\u2026) The current attention to issues of professionalism and professionalization in \n\nscience communication may be taken as a sign of the growing maturity in practice, education \n\nand research in the field. This article suggests that greater care should be taken in how this \n\nprocess is understood. As outlined above, it should be seen as a process that is bringing \n\nbenefits to those working in the field but also as a process that may never be completed, in \n\nthat science communication takes its place alongside formally recognized professions. (\u2026)\u201d  \n\n(Trench, 2017, p. 6). \u201c(\u2026) It would represent dangerous hubris if (professional) science \n\ncommunicators were to define the practice of science communication as theirs alone. \n\nUniversity education and other activities in the field should aim to support the present \n\nspecialists and prepare the future ones to facilitate scientists in doing public communication \n\nas much as to do it themselves.\u201d (Trench, 2017, p. 7). \n\nIn the context of environmental education, Edgar Morin\u00b4s theory of complexity can \n\nbe better explored as a theoretical tool, where knowledge is produced by the actors involved \n\nin a collaborative and participative way, stimulating the potential of the transition from linear \n\nknowledge (specialization) to an interdisciplinary approach and its intrinsic relationships, \n\nwhere practical and theoretical knowledge can inhabit the same space, influencing each other \n\n(de Jesus Pereira, Friede, Narduchi, &amp; de Miranda, 2017). \n\n \n\n2.2 Immersive Journalism: New Formats and Practices \n\nThe adoption of mobile technologies in Journalism practices opens the way to new \n\n(re) configurations and it will be interesting, in this scenario, to highlight the role of \n\njournalism, regardless of the media form of publication (press, radio, television, online) \n\n(Vicente).  At the present, it is extremely important to rethink the role of the journalist. The \n\nInternet has broken with formats, practices and supports and with standards of objectivity \n\nand impartiality. When the journalist assumes a look and a voice, her or his record \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\ndistinguishes itself from others and resists the trivialization of information: the image as a \n\ntestimony of the reality closest to the truth, allied to storytelling, a journalistic technique that \n\nmanifests itself in the \"art of telling a story\", act as a solution to the homogenization of \n\ncontent and the disinterest of the public (Lind, 2015). \n\nThe use of new languages that stimulate the senses of consumers will not unfeasible \n\nthe rigor of the facts, inherent to the journalistic essence, and, immersive journalism can be \n\nidentified with the use of a hybrid language that brings together elements of the digital game, \n\nentertainment and reporting, on a way to explore (G. G. da Rocha, 2016). Immersive \n\njournalism starts from the premise that the journalist must know the reality he wants to \n\ntransmit to his audience: immersion of the journalist is a necessary condition for the \n\nsubsequent immersion of his audience (Mart\u00edn, 2013).  \n\n Although the concepts of immersion and immersive journalism do not have a \n\nconsensus among the various authors, there is a tendency of a logic of transposing \n\nconsciousness towards a reallocation of realities, triggered psychologically or through \n\ntechnical resources: immersion should not be confused with sensory stimulation and not \n\nonly related to technology, but may manifest itself in different levels of diving and interaction \n\n(Cordeiro &amp; Costa, 2016). Journalism has always worked with the representation of reality, \n\nwhether using traditional media, such as the text, or, with the evolution of practices, the \n\ncombination of multimedia media such as images, sounds, animations, among others. New \n\nexperiences are a reality today and it is possible to note that the trend of immersive reporting \n\nis intended to establish a journalistic narrative with greater user participation, encouraging \n\ntheir interest in the news, placing it in the place of events and thus, as the journalist , to be a \n\nwitness of the facts (da Costa &amp; Brasil, 2017).  \n\nEva Dominguez, in her doctoral thesis, analyzes the investigations carried out in the \n\nfield of immersive journalism which, in the digital sphere, understands as an interactive \n\nnarrative construction that should foster immersion capacity. She describes the opinion of \n\nsome authors, such as Nonny de la Pe\u00f1a, regarding the use of virtual reality technology, \n\nconsidered a fertile field of investigation, which not only enhances visual but also immersive \n\nability in a first-person experience. On the other hand, she highlights the interaction with \n\ndigital content as a feature with immense potential, not merely functional but also narrative \n\n(Mart\u00edn, 2013).   \n\nImmersive journalism can be understood under two principles: from the point of \n\nview of production, which requires the author to have an in-depth level of research and \n\nreflection on the reality to be represented and, from a technical or technological point of \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\nview, where the result of production will be materialized in immersive formats, such as virtual \n\nreality productions, augmented reality, infographics, photos and videos in 360?, that will \n\nallow different sensory experiences comparing with traditional audiovisual formats (Cordeiro \n\n&amp; Costa, 2016). In the last study carried out by ERC, Regulatory Entity for Social \n\nCommunication in Portugal, regarding the new dynamics of audiovisual consumption in \n\nPortugal: \n\n\u201cIn relation to the audiovisual consumption by equipment, following the television, \n\nthe mobile phone / smartphone is the device with the greatest presence in the Portuguese \n\nhome (75.2%), followed by the laptop / laptop computer (52.9%), (48.5%), desktop / \n\ndesktop (32.5%), tablet (30.2%) and game consoles (26.2%). Regarding the type of \n\naudiovisual consumption, \"information\" is the most sought-after segment (89.5%), followed \n\nby stock products \"telenovelas\", \"films\" and \"series\" with an average of 56.3%. The \n\n\"entertainment\", with 50.3%, precedes \"documentaries\" (47.2%) and \"sports\" (44.6%).\u201d (C. \n\nMartins, 2016, p. 25) \n\n \n\nInformation and entertainment are the most popular segments. Infotainment is a \n\nconcept that intersects two segments - information and entertainment - and which has been \n\nincreasingly manifesting itself on the Internet, requiring a research effort to better understand \n\nthe associated processes and potentialities to this phenomenon of communication, taking \n\ninto account the author, content and effects produced in audiences (Berrocal Gonzalo, \n\nRedondo Garc\u00eda, &amp; Campos Dom\u00ednguez, 2012). Assuming the principles that better \n\ninformed citizens make more responsible decisions and that, rather than pondering whether \n\njournalism should inform or entertain, it is important to study its social implications and to \n\naddress media literacy and literacy for citizenship in an integrated way in younger populations \n\n(Brites, 2017). \u201c(\u2026) Thus, news social consumptions are important elements that contribute to \n\nthinking about new forms of civic media literacy, more focused on social processes than in \n\nthe quantification of knowledge and skills. (\u2026)\u201d (Brites, 2017, p. 147). \n\nAccording to the National Environmental Education Strategy6 (ENEA 2020) for the \n\nperiod 2017-2020, recommendations for the media are (p. 25): \u201cReinforce environmental \n\neducation in the academic curricula of media schools; Encourage the continuous \n\nenvironmental training of media professionals, through the organization of training actions, \n\nseminars, journeys, among others; Strengthen the educational dimension of environmental \n\n                                                           \n6 Available in: https://www.apambiente.pt/_zdata/DESTAQUES/2016/ENEA_final.pdf \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\ninformation, using a language that is understandable and accessible to the majority of the \n\npopulation, without losing scientific rigor; Create spaces in the media, fixed and stable, \n\nspecializing in environmental issues.\u201d  \n\nWith the evolution of digital media and creative technologies, there have been \n\nsignificant changes in the production and distribution of stories, and new strategies have \n\nemerged based on assumptions that are strongly different from traditional ones (Noronha, \n\nZagalo, &amp; Martins, 2012).  \n\nInteraction, participation and immersion are three key concepts to understand digital \n\ncommunication. \u201cThe stories of the future (or many of them, at least) will not just be told. \n\nThey will be actively experienced. And interactivity, participation and immersion will \n\ncontinue to be among the core concepts that we will need to soundly understand in order to \n\nsuccessfully engage in a creative process that is successful in terms of audience reach and on \n\nits own creative goals.\u201d (Soler-Adillon, 2017, p. 6) \n\nIn the context of classroom environmental education, the use of emerging \n\ntechnologies, such as virtual reality and augmented reality, must be confronted with the \n\neducational objective to be achieved, with the classroom dynamics and the specific context \n\nof learning, requiring the consideration of various issues and recommendations (Garc\u00eda, \n\nOrtega, &amp; Zednik). The new strategies for integrating interactive elements into digital \n\neducational resources will allow students to be more active in relation to content, facilitating \n\nlearning and promoting greater attractiveness and satisfaction (Tomaz, 2011). It has been \n\ndemonstrated that, in the search for new approaches to attract attention to scientific topics \n\n(such as climate change) by using online games, it is possible to integrate narrative and gaming \n\npromoting the creation of innovative communication solutions (Ouariachi, Olvera-Lobo, &amp; \n\nGuti\u00e9rrez-P\u00e9rez, 2017).  \n\nAt the present, journalistic contents that exploit interactivity and multimodality by \n\nadding gameplay characteristics are still scarce, most of them use the choice of links and little \n\nelse. In education, gamification has shown positive results but, in the media communication, \n\ninitiatives are not expressive. Newsgames can be an excellent educational and communicational \n\ntool, promoting a differentiated journalism (Silva &amp; Barboza, 2018). \n\nDigital media are currently protagonists of a new materiality, not only technological \n\nbut understood as an instance of communication and it is increasingly necessary a \n\nclassification of emerging narrative species (taxonomy) and the development of a multimodal \n\nnotation that allows the consolidation of immersive journalism, which is becoming more and \n\nmore a medium of experience (Vicente, 2017). This author points to an unsustainable \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\nreduction of digital media to the status of \"remediation\" of previous forms of \n\ncommunication, when they are interpreted just only as channels or supports, and not as \n\ndifferent creative substances, or new languages, and it is extremely important distinguish \n\nbetween the digitization of mass media - a reconversion of the species - and the digital nature \n\nof new media. In his view, it is fundamental to organize a grammar that supports producers \n\nand consumers in defense of a human-centered design, and not just in technological \n\nattributes. \n\n \n\n2.3 Digital Storytelling and Interactive Documentary \n\nThe interactive documentary (i-doc) is a recent genre without rigid definitions, and it \n\nhas manifested one rapid development with the technological advances, in an \n\ninterdisciplinary environment, intersecting areas of knowledge and creativity from the cinema \n\nand audiovisual, the programming, interactivity and design interfaces (Amorim &amp; Baldi, \n\n2013). In this emerging environment, the documentary is reformulated in an attitude of \n\nexperimentation and an updated look at the possibilities it can manifest: nonlinear, \n\ninteractive, multimedia, hybrid, convergent, immersive, virtual, 360\u00ba, collaborative, \n\nparticipatory, among others, some still unknown (Nash, Hight, &amp; Summerhayes, 2014). \n\nSandra Gaudenzi views interactive documentary as a new entity that does not follow \n\nthe continuity of traditional documentary, and should not be confined to the simple act of \n\nhuman-machine interaction, alerting to a greater systemic understanding of the process \n\n(Gaudenzi, 2013b).  \n\nOne of the premises of the traditional documentary is the desire to organize a story \n\nthat associates the informational and the entertaining role, and in this sense, the interactive \n\ndocumentary must keep this tradition as efficient, original and attractive as possible (Castells, \n\n2011). In the articulation between the conventional format, with a linear structure, strong \n\nauthorial and unidirectional in the relation with the spectator, and the documentary with \n\ninteractive characteristics, it is taken into account the remodeling of discourse and aesthetics, \n\nfor a more participatory culture that promotes an active construction of knowledge (Gouveia \n\n&amp; Antunes, 2011). The interactive documentary constitutes an aesthetic change, organizing \n\nthe content in levels of interactivity that establish functions for the user-spectator, within \n\ndifferent possibilities of interaction (Levin, 2015). \n\nThe first symposium about interactive documentary was held in 2011 at the Digital \n\nCultures Research Center (DCRC) at the University of the West of England, in Bristol. Since \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\nthen, three more symposia have been held in 2012, 2014 and 2016 and recently a book has \n\nbeen published that brings together several works on this format to date, which can be seen \n\nin the words of Prof. Brian Winston (in the foreword to this book) as a very useful \n\ncartographic work that reconfigures the boundaries between author, product and viewer, \n\nenhancing hybrid formats, at the boundaries between these elements (Aston, Gaudenzi, &amp; \n\nRose, 2017). According to these authors, the definition of interactive documentary is open \n\nand generally frames \"any project that begins its intention to engage with reality and uses \n\ninteractive digital technology to accomplish this purpose\". Since there is a secular tradition \n\nrelated to cinema and therefore to the documentary genre, in which the constitutive raw \n\nmaterial is originally a moving image, a generalist approach to the term documentary, \n\nassociated with the current scenario of the production of new formats, can be seen as a \n\nsemantic abuse that should not be neglected (Almeida &amp; Alvelos, 2010). I-docs appear \n\ntherefore paradoxically not only as the future venue for documentary film and for cinema at \n\nlarge, but also as a tribute to documentary films \u2018own past and origins (Favero, 2013, p. 274). \n\nThe complexity and innovation associated with the establishment of interactive \n\ndocumentary in the last ten years, in parallel with the evolution of Web 2.0, has prompted \n\nSandra Gaudenzi to carry out her doctoral thesis, looking at this format as a \u201cliving \n\ndocumentary\u201d and proposing a classification in four families: hypertextual, conversational, \n\nparticipatory and experiential, a way of classification, which although not the only one, helps \n\nto understand the concept of interactivity, briefly indicated below (Gaudenzi, 2013b): \n\n\u2022 Hypertextual: adopts a hypertextual form as it establishes links between the various \n\nobjects (such as videos) of a closed database, allowing the user to explore the \n\npreprogrammed options. Also called webdocumentary (web-doc).  \n\n\u2022 Conversational: uses 3D virtual worlds that allow the user a freedom to explore the \n\ncontent, in a logic that the interaction simulates reality, as if the user is positioned in \n\na continuous \"conversation\" with the computer. \n\n\u2022 Participatory: it addresses the logic of one open database and an evolutionary way, \n\nthat is, the contents can be added by both users and authors, in one group of \n\nconstruction that remains for as long as there are interested people. \n\n\u2022 Experiential: incorporates the Global Positioning System (GPS) into an adaptation \n\nin dynamic environment, that is, as the user moves in a physical space their senses \n\nwill be challenged by the addition of information layers. \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\n \n\n\u201cWhat Living Documentaries allow us to do is to look at interactive documentaries \n\nas dynamic entities that co-emerge while they live through the interactions with the Internet, \n\ntheir users, subject, producers, or any acting entity They put the emphasis on becoming, rather \n\nthan explaining.\u201d (Gaudenzi, 2013a, p. 26). The web documentary will then be a form of \n\ninteractive documentary, since the first one highlights the support where the interactivity \n\ntakes place (the Internet) and the second puts the interactivity as the central aspect to take \n\ninto account, something that is not only present on the Internet (Penafria, 2014).  \n\n The possibilities of the interactive documentary, in which the interactivity is intrinsic, \n\nbring several tensions, from various angles and points of view, namely about the need to \n\nexplore what is a narrative, about the representation of reality and its main purpose and the \n\nrole of the author. The freedom of users in an interactive documentary can proportionally \n\nreduce the author's point of view and author\u00b4s ability to argue, with a considerable risk in \n\nterms of user involvement, which may compromise or even cancel the author's purpose \n\n(Forceville, 2017).  Based on the premise of user participation as expected, the interactive \n\ndocumentary establishes a specific position of the audience in relation to its content, and it \n\nwill be interesting to evaluate who speaks, the extent of reciprocity, and how the audience \n\npositions itself in that exchange (Levin, 2015). A new and creative imagery scenario has \n\nemerged, with the use of interactive digital languages and technological devices to narrate \n\nstories, but it will be important not to forget the hermeneutical purposes involved in the \n\ndialogic stories or underestimate the semantic thickness of texts (Amorim &amp; Baldi, 2013). \n\nNonlinear narratives have been seen as threats to the authorial voice but, in this new genre \n\nas interactive documentary, are a great opportunity to share more varied and immersive \n\nexperiences and to satisfy three needs of the interactors: entertainment, education and \n\ncommunication with other participants (Castells, 2011). In relation to the tensions associated \n\nwith authorship, Sandra Gaudenzi reinforces the authors' role in a process centered on end \n\nusers, with the following considerations: \u201cWhat is left in the hands of the author is the \n\nintentionality of the project: its general story/idea, the choice of who it is aimed at and the \n\ndelineation of its final purpose. I-docs storytellers are more facilitators than narrators and, \n\ntogether with a creative team, they are responsible for the coherence of the final user \n\nexperience.\u201d (Aston et al., 2017, p. 126). \n\n In journalism, the transformation of digital storytelling, along with the evolution of \n\ninteractive documentaries produced in the last twenty years, has manifested itself in a wide \n\nspectrum of techniques and approaches in the design and production of the interactive \n\ndocumentary, and so there is no single standard of design (Pavlik &amp; Pavlik, 2017). How to \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\nexplain that since 2005 hundreds of interactive documentaries have been published on the \n\ninternet and that, despite the apparent success, most of them do not involve their users in an \n\neffective way? To try to answer this question, Samuel Gantier and Michel Labor proposed a \n\nmethodology based on the evaluation of user experience, in the context of the production \n\nof a web-doc in the television environment, to try to perceive the tensions associated when \n\n\"real users\" are not at the center of the productive process (Aston et al., 2017, pp. 101-116). \n\nThese authors support the idea that the heterogeneity of decision-makers, who participate in \n\nthe production of an interactive documentary, tends to be oriented in different \"user models\" \n\nwithout verifying who the \"real users\" are. Sandra Gaudenzi has studied, within her research \n\nproject i-doc UX Series, the misunderstandings and clashes between expectations and \n\ncreative approaches to the elements that make up the production teams. And, in this sense, \n\nthinking about the user experience versus author experience dichotomy from the perspective \n\nof User Centered Design (UCD), Gaudenzi recalls that without a hearing there can be no \n\ndesign in which: \u201cDesigning for, and with, an audience means committing to an aesthic, a \n\nplatform and a language that best suit such an audience \u2013 even if these do not fit with the \n\npersonal taste of the author. The question here is not to `please\u00b4 the audience, but to \u00b4make \n\nsense\u00b4 for such audience\u201d (Aston et al., 2017, pp. 121-122).  \n\n William Uricchio in an analysis of the future possibilities of the documentary in a \n\nhistorical perspective, ends his contribution with the phrase: \u201cOur task is neither to lament \n\nthe passing of the old nor grow frantic over the emergence of the new, but rather to assess \n\ncarefully and critically their capacities and implications for documentary practice and \n\nrepresentational literacy more broadly\u201d (Aston et al., 2017, p. 203).  \n\nIn a recent research was highlighted nonlinearity, as a central trend to contemporary \n\nways of seeing and living, and, interactive documentary as a rich field of enquiry and a \n\nvaluable methodological tool for geographers (Harris, 2017). Liz Miller is one researcher who \n\nargues that interactive documentary is a format with extreme potential in education \n\n(@i_docs, 2017). In a recent study, the authors suggest \"new best practices\" for university \n\njournalism students to think and act as web designers in creating the interactive documentary \n\nformat, alerting journalists and educators in this field to adapt to this challenging \n\nenvironment in constant change (Gyori &amp; Charles, 2017). Things acquire meaning from the \n\nmoment they are used in specific activities and contexts and according to the interpretations \n\nthat people are able to conceive from the meanings that the things offer them (Mi\u00f1ana, 2017). \n\nIn one recent study, is pointed the main use of web documentary to create awareness about \n\nsocial issues, the lack of use of that format in science communication and the needs of further \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\n \n\ninvestigation about that approach, to connect people to identity, memory and places and \n\npromote plural perspectives about one specific subject (Casella, 2018). \n\n2.4 Remix and UX Design \n\nIn a recent academic work, the concept of Remix is analyzed and validated as an \n\naesthetic resource of great utility to develop a critical spirit and to promote a creative process: \n\ninherent in the culture of the remix are actions such as cut, copy and paste, activities that \n\ncharacterize some of its creation processes, which by combining and recombining existing \n\nor original material, analog and digital are retransformed into new communicative \n\npossibilities (Sousa, 2017). The documentary \u201cEverything is a Remix Remastered\u201d (2015) \n\nfrom Kirby Ferguson7 is commented in that work in which analyzes the use of remix in \n\ndifferent areas such as music, engineering, science, internet, among others, bringing a new \n\nperspective to the uses of the remix, questioning the absolute originality, the fact that \n\neverything is created from an existing creation. \u201cThe remix can thus be considered as a form \n\nof speech, that is, it can be understood as a linguistic tool for a particular audience. This tool \n\noffers the public grammar that, when assimilated and understood, enables them to create \n\ninformation that uses the same grammatical universe. As we have seen, the remix adapts to \n\nthe different areas where it is inserted and used in different ways, like speech, methodology \n\nor aesthetics\u201d (Sousa, 2017, p. 55). \n\nUX Design (User Experience Design) is a complex concept. \u201cTo the uninitiated, UX \n\ndesign can seem like an intimidating field. The sheer number of topics it touches is mind-\n\nboggling: there\u2019s interaction design (the psychology of motion and feedback), design thinking \n\n(an iterative, empathy-based problem-solving process), and usability (how easily a product \n\ncan be used), just to name a few. Nevertheless, that\u2019s also what makes the field so fascinating \n\nto so many people.\u201d (Foundation, p. Preface). According to Peter Morville, a reference in \n\nthe field of UX study, there are 7 factors that describe and facilitate the understanding of the \n\nUX Design concept, indicated in the image 1, below: \n\n                                                           \n7 Available in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJPERZDfyWc \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\n \n\nImage 1 - Source: The Basics of User Experience (UX) Design by Interaction \n\nDesign Foundation (p. 22) \n\nThe premise of this project is Design thinking that can be understood as a problem-\n\nsolving approach to improve design of creative solutions, and the communicative proposes \n\nof the strategic action are: \n\n\u2022 Developing familiarity with the topic plant blindness (PB) and associate it to \n\nBotanical Gardens (specifically JBA) and their importance to society putting into \n\npractice Responsible Research and Innovative (RRI)  \n\n\u2022 Raising awareness of causes and consequences about plant blindness promoting \n\ncitizenship and responsibility on topics as Biodiversity, Conservation and \n\nSustainability \n\n\u2022 Stimulating the development of ideas and solutions to attenuate PB, promoting a \n\nbetter plant science communication, with focus in a case study in JBA, using \n\ninnovative digital media and exploring interactivity, immersiveness and participation \n\nin classrooms of different levels of education \n\nMainstreaming the social sciences in conservation, incorporating social science \n\nresearch and insights in natural science and conservation is seen as an unique and important \n\ncontribution to society\u00b4s understanding of the relationships between humans and nature ant \n\nto advancing conservation practices and outcomes (Bennett et al., 2017). \u201c(\u2026) A productive \n\nengagement with the conservation social sciences will likely require long-term ongoing \n\npartnerships, knowledge and capacity building, open dialogue, clear communication, \n\nreflection on past and present practice, and a willingness to adapt programs of work. A more \n\ninclusive conservation science (i.e., one that includes methods and insights from the natural \n\nsciences, the social sciences, and the humanities) will enable the conservation community to \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n\n \n\nproduce more ecologically effective and socially just conservation. Mainstreaming the \n\nconservation social sciences will facilitate the uptake of the full range of insights and \n\ncontributions from these fields into conservation policy and practice\u201d (Bennett et al., 2017, \n\np. 65).  \n\nJournalism can have an important role in its own activities, strengthening the \n\ndissemination of knowledge about conservation of nature and becoming a bridge to create \n\n\u201cspaces of environmental education\u201d. It is important to investigate the potential learning, \n\nsocialization and innovation that are capable to support and encourage sustainable choices \n\nand the social change among young people - and the possible strategies for design-based \n\ninterventions (Mouchrek, 2017). \u201cThe practice with various pedagogical models of online \n\nlearning, in the context of several Portuguese and European universities, has demonstrated \n\nthat it is not enough provide the student with pre-formatted teaching / learning models, \n\nsupported by standard virtual environments or in the teacher's educational communication, \n\nit should also be given to each student the opportunity to choose his / her own personal \n\nlearning environmental (PLE) by adding the tools and resources that best fit his / her style \n\nand personal goals in a given context. (\u2026) The rather common attempt to use the computer \n\nwith the mere aim of making learning more attractive is failure. It is necessary to use \n\npedagogical models that can ensure the effectiveness of cognitive processes, which provide \n\na better understanding of the subjects and simultaneously provide great satisfaction to \n\nlearners, using new interactive multimedia environments.\u201d (Bidarra, 2011, p. 13). \u201cIn addition \n\nto the curricular content foreseen in formal education, exhibitions and museographic \n\nelements have the important role of instigating following aspects: a) Manual interactivity; b) \n\nMental interactivity; c) Interactivity cultural. Emotion lies at the basis of the three classes of \n\ninteractivity presented.\u201d (Lamim-Guedes, 2018, p. 87). \u201cThere is a need for greater \n\ninteraction between museums and schools, including public policies and private actions that \n\npositively stimulate the association between these institutions. In this sense, it is important \n\nto carry out activities that bring teachers inside the museum, demonstrating better ways of \n\nusing museum space and expositions, in an articulated way with the contents approached in \n\nthe classroom. On the other hand, traveling exhibitions are an important way of taking the \n\nmuseum to schools and communities.\u201d (Lamim-Guedes, 2018, p. 91). \n\nIn this context, is interesting to explore the mobilizing and educational potential of \n\ninteractive documentary in formal education, as a science communication tool, in botany \n\nclasses and in journalism classes. Using Ajuda Botanical Garden (JBA) as a scenario to test \n\nthe proof of concept of this project, rather than expressing a specific point of view in that \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\n \n\nformat, is intended to develop an orchestra of debate and reflection around the central \n\ntheme, botany and conservation of biodiversity as a vital pillar of environmental \n\nsustainability, and achieve some clues how to develop an interactive documentary to promote \n\ncitizenship about those issues and that can be useful in the context of educational activity. It \n\nis also intended to promote new forms of interpretation and exploitation of audiovisual \n\nformats and digital literacy. More than producing a final product the aim of this project is \n\nthe whole experience of the design process, where is intended to produce with the target \n\naudience (and not for), and so, both the research process and the development of the final \n\nproduct are equally important (although we are still at a very early stage of the project). This \n\nwork has an exploratory approach, and the exploration focus is on the potential of interactive \n\ndocumentary to engage all the stakeholders. \u201cEngagement is not only about looking nice but \n\nalso about looking right.\u201d (Foundation, p. 31). \u201c(..) Firstly, I think it\u2019s clear that in spite of all \n\nthe new ways of tracking audiences: hits, clicks, shares and so on, most people are engaging \n\non the inside. This isn\u2019t unique to idocs \u2013 there are now a large number of studies in various \n\ncontexts showing that people are much more inclined to listen than comment. (\u2026) The \n\nchallenge for idocs makers is to cater for the non-fan as well as the fan; to make space for \n\ndifferent levels of engagement with content. In closing, I want to make a plea to all of you \u2013 \n\nas the idocs community we should all start to think of ourselves as audience researchers. We \n\nshould all be looking for opportunities to work together on understanding what makes the \n\nidocs audience unique and being able to show funders and broadcasters the kind of impact \n\nthis work can have.\u201d  (@i_docs Nash, 2014) \n\nDespite the rapid evolution of the genre, interactive documentary, is still little known \n\nby the audiences, and most of the productions have been carried out focusing on the authors \n\n/ producers' view in a more technical way and not so much on the level of social involvement \n\nand the possibilities associated with this posture. That\u00b4s the aim of this project, to look how \n\ninteractive documentary can be a great ally to induce social change in a beneficial and \n\nsustainable way. According to Gaudenzi (2013), is pointed the argument that i-doc, rather \n\nthan representing reality, builds and experiences reality. According to Almeida &amp; Alvelos \n\n(2010), in a medium of uncertainties and dilemmas, a heuristic impulse in a new orientation \n\nwill be an important approach to searching for i-doc identity.  \n\n\u201cAdvances in scientific visualization and public access to data have transformed \n\nscience outreach and communication, but have yet to realize their potential impacts in the \n\nrealm of education. Computer-based learning is a clear bridge between visualization and \n\neducation that benefits students through adaptative personalization and enhanced access. \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\n \n\nBuilding this bridge requires close partnerships among scientists, technologists, and \n\neducators. The Infiniscope project fosters such partnerships to produce exploration-driven \n\nonline learning experiences that teach basic science concepts using a combination of \n\nauthentic space science narratives, data, and images, and a personalized guided inquiry \n\napproach. Infiniscope includes a web portal to host these digital learning experiences, as well \n\nas a teaching network of educators using and modifying these experiences. Infiniscope \n\nexperiences are built around a new theory of digital learning design that we call \u201ceducation \n\nthrough exploration\u201d (ETX) developed during the creation of successful online, interactive \n\nscience courses offered at Arizona State University and other institutions. (\u2026)\u201d (Anbar, \n\n2018, p. abstract). Design thinking is being increasingly used for innovative efforts and being \n\na subject of interest by both academics and practitioners (Engberts &amp; Borgman, 2018).  \n\nThe signature of this project, XploreDesign4SciComm, can be understood based on \n\nthe considerations of a recent work, exposed below: \n\n\u201c(\u2026), drawing action in specific situations and recognizing them as guidelines for the \n\nconstruction of meaning through design is a transdisciplinary invariant, that is, it extends to \n\nother practices of human activity. (\u2026) designers prioritize values in decision-making that are \n\nbased on emotions, intuitions, reasons, experiences and constraints; five invariant categories \n\nin designers.\u201d (da Silva Vieira, 2018, p. 108). \u201cDesign is a social process of negotiation, \n\ninteraction, rectification in which sometimes even misunderstandings contribute to a process \n\nrich in ambiguity and uncertainty. Each discipline has its own set of features, some \n\nconstituting entirely parts of larger sets, some sets overlap, others are disjointed, that is, they \n\ndon\u00b4t contain elements in common. Areas of overlap between disciplines are, in their feature \n\nset, also a recognized unit. (\u2026) Each discipline or shared space finds its place and creates its \n\natmosphere and influence, overlapping the aspects that have been absorbed and that have \n\nbecome predominant. Partially shared spaces between design discipline are hybrids of greater \n\ncreative freedom, very focused on communication (theater, cinema, animation, documentary, \n\ndigital media)\u201d (da Silva Vieira, 2018, p. 110). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\n \n\n \n\n3. Methodology \n\nThis project intends to clarify the subject under study and, regarding the nature of \n\nthe problem, has a qualitative approach. The objectives are exploratory aiming to have a \n\ngreater familiarity with the theme, since it is an area yet to be consolidated. The method used \n\nwas action research where after a remix of theoretical content and a reflection on that set is \n\narchitected an action, trying an innovative approach that can add value to practical case \n\nstudies and plan targeted actions. It is not intended to test or confirm a hypothesis but to \n\nevaluate which existing theories and concepts can be applied to a given problem. For the \n\ndevelopment of this study, considering the delimitation of the problem, the objectives and \n\nmethod, different procedures and techniques were used:  \n\n\u2022 Bibliographical review to find theoretical references and logical foundation about the \n\ninvolved topics \n\n\u2022 Interviews with people with experience in the fields of study \n\n\u2022 Questionnaires addressed to students involved in proof of concept \n\n\u2022 Focus Group to collect data through group interaction on the topic Plant Blindness, \n\nusing the hybrid prototype (i-doc) in classrooms \n\n\u2022 Participation observation \n\nBelow, the table 1 summarizes the classification of the action research developed in this \n\nwork: \n\nApproach Qualitative \n\nObjective Exploratory \n\nProcedures / Techniques Bibliographical Review \n\nInterviews \n\nQuestionnaires \n\nFocus Group \n\nParticipation observation \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Adopted research design \n\nIn this project, action research is considered as a way of researching for education, and not \n\nabout education, a methodology that can achieve better results when it is intended to bring \n\npeople together in the process, favoring dialogue, educational practices and critical reflection \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\n \n\n(Coutinho et al., 2009). The next image 2 summarizes, in a simplified way, the main phases \n\nof the study, developed between September 2017 and March 2018 and, next, in table 2 are \n\nthe key work packages (WP) associated to the work, being the respective tasks described in \n\nmore detail in the following sections: \n\n \n\nImage 2 - Source: Author\u00b4s perspective  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 2 - Source: Author\u00b4s perspective \n\n3.1 Work Package 1 \u2013 Planning \n\nIn the beginning, thinking about the reason of the main idea (why), for who can be \n\nuseful, where and when to apply it, was the root to formulate the main questions at this \n\nphase: \n\n\u2022 How do I gather content? \n\n\u2022 How do I organize it? \n\n\u2022 How do I put it in a storyboard? \n\n\u2022 How do I get it reviewed? \n\n\u2022 How do I get everybody brought into the process? \n\nAnd so, the tasks in pre-production were: \n\n \n\nPre-\nProduction\n\nDemo-\nProduction\n\nEvaluation-\nTests\n\nInputs Transformation Outputs \n\nSep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar \n\n1 - Planning 2 - Action  3 - Analysis \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\n \n\n\u2022 a bibliographical research to structure the line of action and to argue the usefulness \n\nof the interactive documentary as a favorable means to promote the teaching of \n\nsciences like botany and to promote the socio-environmental responsibility of \n\njournalism \n\n\u2022 point out problems that need solutions and think about how to improve new \n\napproaches that can join people to work together to solve actual challenges (as plant \n\nblindness and improvements in educational practices) \n\n\u2022 production and sharing, in Facebook, a pilot questionnaire about botanical gardens \n\nin Portugal, focusing on JBA, to verify if the oldest botanical garden in Portugal is \n\nknown by the Portuguese (annex I) \n\n\u2022 participation in coffee-meetings, a iNOVA Media Lab\u00b4s event, where students, \n\nresearchers and teachers talk informally and share their research and lines of action \n\n(November and December) \n\n\u2022 participation in tree meetings of XR Immersive Media Portugal, which is a regular \n\nevent in Portugal created by iNOVA Media Lab (FCSH-Nova), NowHere Media and \n\nChicas Poderosas, and promotes the sharing of interests, ideas and knowledge \n\nbetween all persons who want to learn and innovate in the media sphere (September, \n\nNovember and February) \n\n\u2022 in the first meetup in XR Immersive, Diogo Melo, Partner &amp; Director of Innovation \n\nand Products at DIFR, manifested interest in this project and a meeting was held \n\nwith the DIFR team, for future actions (annex II) \n\n\u2022 research about interactive documentaries produced and well-known up to the \n\npresent, internationally and nationally, and select some of them to serve as a reference \n\nto simulate the concept to be tested - 3 references of interactive documentaries that \n\nhelped to architect the lines of the script for demo-production: \n\nhttps://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2014/piratefishingdoc/ \n\nhttp://hollowdocumentary.com/ \n\nhttp://avespaixaoeuropeia.wixsite.com/webdocumentarioaves \n\n\u2022 establish contact with Azambuja secondary school on November, personally and via \n\nemail, with the director and professor of Biology and Geology of 11th grade, to \n\nensure the possibility of carrying out the tests in the classroom (annex III). It was \n\nagreed that the test date would be occur at the end of February or beginning of March \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\n \n\n\u2022 It was also agreed by the same time, personally with the teacher of master\u00b4s \n\njournalism, to run the test phase at FCSH - Nova, at the beginning of the second \n\nsemester (February/March) \n\nThe choice of the two classes was not completely random. It considered the purpose \n\nof the study and the fact that the author had previous contact with the Azambuja Secondary \n\nSchool, during one work developed at the Master's Science and Society seminar. Being a \n\nstudent at FCSH-NOVA and developing her project at iNOVA Media Lab also facilitated \n\nthe choice of the master\u00b4s class to participate in the proof of concept. \n\nInitially, in the bibliographic search, the following keywords were used, in Portuguese \n\nand English, in the search engine Google, YouTube and Google Scholar: interactive \n\ndocumentary, science communication, scientific education, emerging digital media, 360 \n\nvideos, science journalism, immersive journalism, communication science and design, design \n\nthinking, botany teaching, environmental education, virtual reality and augmented reality, UX \n\nDesign. Later, with meetings with other students, researchers and professionals in those \n\nareas, I received references such as books, scientific journals and other resources, including \n\nsocial networks references, which allowed me to explore different sources. Being the focus \n\nto explore the interactive documentary, this was one of the key words behind all the research, \n\nafter which the theoretical clipping was carried out at, the same time the field and the \n\nrespective possibilities were deepened. One important reference, in this phase, was a \n\ntransmedia meta-documentary that reflects on the interactive documentary as a new \n\naudiovisual format with specific characteristics, COME/IN/DOC8. The model for \n\nproducing an interactive documentary in 7 steps was very useful to plan in more detail the \n\ninitial idea of the project9 . Another important reference was the work \u201ci-docs\u201d, a term coined \n\nby Sandra Gaudenzi, available in this site10, where is possible to explore several resources and \n\ntrends, as looking for i-docs as a field to explore in education11. \n\nPortuguese academic theses about interactive documentaries were found, but the \n\nclear majority (Correia, 2015; A. d. L. C. da Rocha, 2017; de Oliveira Marques, 2016; Ferreira, \n\n2016; Guimar\u00e3es, 2014; Quintas, 2015; Ribeiro, 2017; Rodrigues, 2013), based the study on \n\nanalyzing or comparing existing interactive documentaries or exploring the associated \n\n                                                           \n8 Available in: http://comeindoc.com/educational/about/ \n9 Available in: http://comeindoc.com/educational/video-produce/ \n10 Available in: http://i-docs.org/ \n11 Available in: http://i-docs.org/2012/08/15/interactive-documentary-and-education-a-field-to-explore-\ni/ \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\n \n\ntaxonomies and potentialities, without focusing the study on self-production for a specific \n\npurpose and including the audience in the initial process of the project, and this is a \n\ndifferentiation that is aimed to point out. On the other hand, botanical gardens, being \n\nscientific museums, can improve and innovate their communication, with new digital media, \n\nproviding differentiating experiences to target-publics and promoting its recognition and \n\nnotoriety while reinforce its social and educational role. Some academic works were taken \n\ninto account in the audiovisual perspective (dos Reis Ramalho, 2015; Ferreira, 2016). \n\nAnother motivation was the research about the use of 360 video and virtual reality in \n\ninnovative journalistic formats and the need for more research on the subject (de Oliveira \n\nMarques, 2016). In a recent academic work, it was also emphasized the use of immersive \n\nmedia, such as 360 video and virtual reality, in the promotion of tourism in Portugal, and \n\nmore research is needed on the use of 360 video, particularly in terms of tourism experience \n\n(de Oliveira Magalh\u00e3es, 2017). In online research about interactive documentaries, two \n\nPortuguese works, with that specific attribute, were found12. In both works, it was verified \n\nthe tendency to the format \"website\", based on the hyperlinks and scroll, with text and \n\nimages, traditional photographs and videos, and, therefore, more distant from the \n\ncinematographic format. Any of them fall into the category of web documentary. Two award-\n\nwinning multimedia reports, both interactive narratives, were also found13, and is interesting \n\nto see some similarities with i-doc format. The Portuguese documentaries accessed on \n\nYouTube about botanical gardens in Portugal, including Ajuda Botanical Garden, are in the \n\ntraditional format and so it is interesting to seek a differentiation, exploring the field of \n\ninteractive documentary as a proposal to improve the communication of these scientific \n\nmuseums. The project FCSH +Lisboa14 is also a reference, a work that reinforces the \n\nimportance of university in contemporary societies and the need to adapt it to current social \n\nreality, where cultural journalism and digital platforms are key fields (Ponte &amp; Silva, 2017). \n\nThis reality was vital in the planning of the project and allowed, to see connections \n\nbetween concepts, problems, experience, interventions and outcomes, in general between \n\ntheory and practice, making possible the actions: \n\n                                                           \n12 Available in:  \n\nhttp://avespaixaoeuropeia.wixsite.com/webdocumentarioaves (2014) \nhttp://cavalgaraondanazare.ulusofona.pt/ (2016) \n \n\n13 Available in: http://rr.sapo.pt/a-sul-da-sorte/ \nhttp://multimedia.expresso.pt/jihad/PT/matar-e-morrer/index.html \n14 Available in: http://maislisboa.fcsh.unl.pt/ \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n\n \n\n\u2022 to use evidences to understand the change process \n\n\u2022 to motivate to generate ideas for change and improve situations \n\n\u2022 to work with others to clarify complex problems \n\nAn important decision was to identify what would be produced, within the human \n\nand technical resources and having the limitation of the time factor. Articulating Storytelling, \n\nGaming and Multimodality in the i-doc format was the premise to move on to the next phase, \n\nbeing itself the planning phase an iterative process. The next phase is planned to a demo-\n\nproduction of one prototype that simulates the interface of interaction with the user and that \n\nallows the simulation of the content, the interactions of the interface and the test of the main \n\ninteractions, the closest to the concept designed by the author. \n\n3.2 Work Package 2 - Demo-Production \n\nThere were also many iterations during this phase and an important question that \n\narose was in relation how to produce the artifact that could represent, as close as possible, \n\nthe concept to be tested with the target audience. The distinction between wireframe, \n\nprototype and mockup was an initial doubt but it helped later to architect the digital hybrid \n\nused in proof of concept. One reference that helped was this one15. For the author, it was a \n\ngreat challenge to experiment the production of audiovisual content, given the limited \n\nexperience. What the author could present in the prototype resulted from several attempts \n\nand using different free digital tools. She developed 360 photographs, besides text, traditional \n\nphotographs, used simple and in slideshow with music, proposal of games about botany and \n\nrelated sciences and a story about Ajuda Botanical Garden, written during a Storytelling \n\ntraining. Other formats, like audio design, 360 video and virtual reality, were presented only \n\nwith practical examples of the associated possibilities, in the context of interface design \n\npresented. \n\nThe main tasks in demo-production were: \n\nsketching and paper prototyping, based on author\u00b4s professional and academic \n\nexperience and the theoretical framework obtained, choosing the target and context \n\n \n\n                                                           \n15 Available in: https://designmodo.com/wireframing-prototyping-mockuping/ \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\n \n\n\u2022 write the script with the described specifications of the experience to be provided to \n\nthe audience and develop the basic design of user interfaces in PowerPoint, related \n\nto the multimedia system that was imagined \n\n\u2022 share via email the script with professionals, from audiovisual and design areas, and \n\nreceive feed-back (annex IV) \n\n\u2022 mature the idea in a multimedia object that will be the reference for the proof of \n\nconcept, articulating storytelling and gaming, in a digital prototype \n\n\u2022 make experiences with photos 360 and 2D photos and videos, despite the lack of \n\npractice of the researcher. Most of the audiovisual experiences in the prototype were \n\nproduced by her, using her smartphone (Samsung, model GT-I9195, Android \n\nversion 4.4.2) and Cardboard Camera in Google Play to take 360 photos \n\n\u2022 produce botanical games about JBA in Rise, one web-based e-learning tool in \n\nArticulate 360, to simulate the main idea, and compile all the information on a \n\nwebsite, built later \n\n\u2022 study the alternatives to produce the hybrid, storytelling software as Eko Studio \n\n(Interlude), Klynt, Korsakow, Articulate Storyline, and choose the \u201cbest\u201d option, \n\nconsidering the technical and temporal limitations and the ability to represent the \n\nconcept, without using programming language \n\n\u2022 participation in a training course at Cenjor, a professional training center for \n\njournalists, on Visual Narratives, between January 29 and February 26, 2018 (the \n\ninscription had been made in September 2017 but only at the end of January began \n\nthe course) and produce one narrative (text and photos) (annex V) \n\n\u2022 gather all the contents in one website, simulating the hybrid: \n\nxploredesign4scicomm.wordpress.com (annex VI) \n\nBoth the initial pilot questionnaire, about Portuguese botanical gardens, and the \n\ndeveloped narrative were based on an academic paper developed in 2013 at the higher \n\ninstitute of agronomy - (Rosa, 2013) - and a book about Ajuda botanical garden (JBA), \n\npublished in 1999 - (Castel Branco, 1999), in addition to the author 's experience during the \n\nGuide training in JBA, between October 2012 and March 2013, and the experience \n\naccumulated with this activity in the last 5 years. The choice of content developed in the \n\nhybrid, botanical games mainly, focused on the themes that the 11-year classroom\u00b4s teacher  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n\n \n\nsaid he would be teaching in February and March. However, it was tried to take a more \n\ngeneral approach, not only focused on curricular contents of Biology and Geology. \n\nIn hybrid i-doc\u00b4s design, although are used web site\u2019s characteristics, is tried to \n\nachieve one format closest to the cinematographic view and, in the content structure, are \n\nconsidered 3 axes, according to this reference16: \n\n\u2022 Author-User: author defines possibilities, paths in the narrative, and defines the \n\nfreedom of the user, according to the main objective. The aim is to provide a moment \n\nof discovery and excitement to user, informing and stimulating reflection / action. \n\n\u2022 Author-Text: author balances the control and discovery that is available to users \n\n(such possible paths to explore) \n\n\u2022 User-Text: an attempt to balance the degree of fun and difficulty associated with the \n\nuser, neither very fun nor very difficult, articulating different media and content \n\n(narrative, gaming, exploratory, participatory) \n\nThe following table 3 summarizes the topic/subject, platforms and user experience \n\nthat are thought in this project and is adapted according to this source17: \n\n  \nTopic / Subject  \n\n \n\n \nSupport / \nPlatform \n\n \nUser Experience \n\nHybrid \nMultimedia \n\n \n \n \n\nEcology and \nEnvironment  \n(focus in Ajuda \nBotanical Garden \nand Plant Blindness \ntheory) \n\n \nEducation, Heritage, \nCulture and \nTourism \n\nWeb \n \n\nMobile \n \n\nMultiplatform \n\nNarrative \nHypertext \nGame \nBranched \nGeolocation \nCollaborative \n\nTable 3 - Adaptation in author\u00b4s perspective \n\nAlthough interactivity is inherent to the whole process in this study, one important \n\nreference to the narrative design in the developed prototype is a point of view from Nelson \n\nZagalo who defends \u201clinearity for the construction of new virtual reality entertainment \n\nartifacts. Linearity that should not be viewed in a simplistic way, but rather as an enhancer \n\nelement an argument with more robust results, namely, in terms of gratification for its users.\u201d  \n\n                                                           \n16 Available in: http://comeindoc.com/educational/resources-4-4-content-structure/ \n17 Available in: http://comeindoc.com/educational/resources-4-1-getting-started-subjecttopic/ \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\n \n\n(Zagalo, 2009, p. 367). In the preface of that work, written by Anthony Barker, can be read: \n\n\u201cEvidence supports the suggestion that narrative receptors respond positively to previously \n\ndefined endings. Open endings can be a threat to the human desire to see their expectations \n\nconcretized.\u201d (Zagalo, 2009, p. 9). Despite the difference in the scope of that work, with \n\nfocus on traditional narrative cinema and its convergence with videogames, it seems \n\npertinent, to the author, to consider the fact that traditional narrative cinema is one artifact \n\nwith greater capacity of emotional involvement, and being the documentary a \n\ncinematographic genre it is interesting to explore that vision for the exploratory purposes of \n\nthis current research. That\u00b4s the reason why the prototype is designed with the proposed \n\nlinearity, that is, the challenge to users is to discover and reflect about their \u201cplant blindness \n\nscore\u201d after experiencing the i-doc, and the contents of the site to be tested must be observed \n\nin a specific order to facilitate the understanding of prototype, in the evaluation-test phase, \n\nwhich is: storytelling \u2013 botanical games \u2013 proof of concept. \n\nIn summary, the main tasks at this stage resulted from the intersection between: \n\nexploring technology \u2013 validating the direction \u2013 communicating the vision, being the \n\nGoogle\u00b4s Methodology, in this reference18, a great help. The next image 3 sums up the \n\ntechnique based on UX (user experience): \n\nImage 3 \u2013 User Experience Technique \n\nSource: https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/a-simple-introduction-to-\nlean-ux \n\n3.2 Work Package 3 \u2013 Analysis \n\nAt this phase, author is part of the process in a self-iterative process, practitioner-\n\nbased, self-reflective and improvement focused. Basically, it starts with the demo-production, \n\nthat is not random but a result of experience, observation and theoretical framework, and \n\nthen check if it works, involving the target audience at the earliest possible stage.  \n\n                                                           \n18 Available in: https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/make-your-ux-design-process-agile-\nusing-google-s-methodology \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\n \n\nConsidering the good practices indicated by Ramona Pringle, the analysis of demo-\n\nproduction considers the following aspects (Aston et al., 2017, pp. 154-169): \n\n\u2022 Test in the initial phase: identify the basic components of the history that constitute \n\nthe system to test \n\n\u2022 Perform the iterative process by unit and identify tools to test \n\n\u2022 Identify key partners and stakeholders in the process \n\n\u2022 Less is more: be careful about \"cognitive noise\", that is, with an overdose of \n\ninteractivity \n\nThe three-dimensional methodology in the evaluation of user experience, proposed \n\nby Gantier &amp; Labor, is also considered to evaluate the interface produced, both in terms of \n\ninformation architecture and interaction design (Aston et al., 2017: 105): \n\n\u2022 Viewing frame \n\n\u2022 Usability \n\n\u2022 Sense-making processes \n\nThese three dimensions are interdependent on a whole and the approach is applied \n\nin iterative loops. The ten heuristics of Nielsen (Nielsen, 2017) are also considered in the \n\nevaluation of the usability of the digital prototype. The proof of concept of this project, \n\nbefore any implementation, is carried out, trying to ensure: \n\n\u2022 Quality: to test usability and suitability among target audiences and take steps to \n\nimprove \n\n\u2022 Acceptance: If the pilot has positive results it will be easier to get help from partners \n\nand even funding to scale the idea \n\n\u2022 Focus: in a more effective and efficient use \n\n\u2022 Knowledge: try to reduce risks and prepare the implementation of the idea with \n\nsolidity \n\nIn a systematic review of the literature on the evaluation of the usability of products \n\nand services, it was found that this is an area of great interest and there is a growing need for \n\na normalization of terminologies, since in many studies the term usability is used in an \n\ninconsistent way (A. I. Martins, Queir\u00f3s, Rocha, &amp; Santos, 2013). These authors found that \n\ninquiry was the most commonly used method, although the combination of methods is \n\nfrequent, especially inquiry and test combination, which allows the collection of qualitative \n\nand quantitative information, in a more complete assessment. \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\n \n\nIn the same study, the authors point out the orientation of organizations to usability very \n\nfocused on technology, with specific approaches in technical and procedural terms. \"The \n\nuser experience goes beyond the efficiency, quality of tasks and user satisfaction, considering \n\nthe cognitive, affective, social and physical aspects of the interaction. In this perspective, the \n\nuser experience contextualizes usability\" (A. I. Martins et al., 2013, p. 32).  Thus, with this \n\nstudy as a reference, the usability evaluation model used in this project is empirical, since it \n\nuses data collected with real users, in 2 classrooms, and the used methods and respective \n\ntechniques are: \n\n\u2022 Test: participant observation \n\n\u2022 Inquiry: to produce two questionnaires, using Likert scale (1 - strongly disagree; 5 \u2013 \n\nstrongly agree), one general and the other, the System Usability Scale (SUS), based in \n\nthis reference19, and two semi-structured interviews, with the respective teachers of \n\nthe two classes involved (annex VII) \n\n\u2022 Outline a Focus Group: with focus on the problem - plant blindness - is proposed \n\nto each group draw an \u201cexploratory tree\u201d, with problems (the possible causes of this \n\nproblem) and solutions (paths or ways that can minimize the problem), the problems \n\nbeing the roots and the solutions branches of the tree, where the trunk is the plant \n\nblindness. It was delivered to each user 2 post-its of different colors, one to write the \n\nproblem and another for the solution, and in the end all the post-it were collected to \n\nanalyze the architected tree, based on the approach model presented in the first guide \n\npublished in Portugal for social entrepreneurs (Santos, Salvado, &amp; de Carvalho, 2013)  \n\n(annex VIII) \n\nAfter this process, the author shared the contents with some colleagues, that are \n\nstudying fields as Science Communication, Immersive Journalism and New Media, trying to \n\nobtain clues and opinions about this approach, to find points of view and can improve the \n\nproject. Interactive documentary productions have mostly established interaction with \n\naudiences in a disclosure posture. What can be a distinction is to establish interaction with \n\naudiences in a custom dialogic form, where users are an inherent part of the process, in a \n\nproduction focused on UX Design. Power should not be centralized in a single part and, in \n\nthis sense, interactive documentary can be used as a scientific communication tool that allows \n\nmapping possible paths, while introducing adaptations. In this project, the interactive \n\n                                                           \n19 Available in: https://usabilitygeek.com/how-to-use-the-system-usability-scale-sus-to-evaluate-the-\nusability-of-your-website/ \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\n \n\ndocumentary is interpreted as a communicative, knowledge-building entity, and not only as \n\na format or a channel. Articulating storytelling and gaming, using multimodality, it has the \n\nmission of increasing environmental awareness (focusing on botany), reflection / action in \n\nan innovative and optimistic problem-solving approach, not forgetting that: \n\n\u2022 Getting success involves \"suffering\", imperfections and improvements, a lot of \n\nthinking and it takes time \n\n\u2022 Never forgetting the goal, the vital story, regardless of formats, content, launching \n\nplatforms, considering the adaptation. Using a format or platform just because they \n\nare appealing can be a mistake, especially if we do not adapt the content \n\n\u2022 Working in a laboratory is useful, but when we look at reality we may encounter bugs \n\nthat were not expected. One important insight is to act in a real context, even with \n\nthe associated limitations \n\n\u2022 What is very logical for the architect of the communicative process may not be so \n\nexplicit to the user, and he is an active part in the process \n\n \n\nIn the next chapter are presented the results obtained in proof of concept which are \n\ncomplemented later, in the discussion chapter, with reflections that aim to promote the \n\nprocess\u00b4s improvement. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\n \n\n4. Proof of Concept (PoC)  \n\n4.1 Evaluation in Natural Context \n\nIn both classrooms, secondary school - 11\u00ba level and university level - master\u00b4s \n\ndegree, PoC is conducted in two phases: first, observing the initial prototype on the site built \n\nfor that purpose, and a second exploratory phase, in which students are challenged to look \n\nfor causes of Plant Blindness problem and possible solutions or improvements that may \n\nminimize this problem. The viability of the idea is tested and if the results are optimistic, that \n\nis, if it is confirmed that the proposal adds value and utility, in the education context and \n\npromoting a public awareness of the issue, is considered a future implementation of a \n\nfunctional prototype, based on the main results obtained. A small introduction is made, about \n\nwhat is being developed and point the fact that no one is being evaluated, that the \n\ncontributions are anonymous and the only evaluation to be carried out is only in relation to \n\ndigital object proposed and the possible impact, in science education and its communication. \n\nIn the beginning, is explained that: \n\n\u2022 Participants can interact with the moderator, asking questions and doubts \n\n\u2022 Each participant observes the prototype in its place, but the moderator shares the \n\ncontents simultaneously for the class, explaining the purpose of each interface and \n\nassociated dynamics, reinforcing the functionality of the proposed object \n\nIn both classrooms, the observation of the contents follows the proposed order: \n\nstorytelling \u2013 botanical games \u2013 prototype observation and the respective teachers were \n\npresent.  \n\nBelow are two tables, table 3 and table 4, with complementary information, which \n\nrepresent the typology of the two classes involved in this process and the respective \n\ncharacteristics as: date of occurrence, number of students involved, classroom typology and \n\nduration of the event. Following, it is explained how the semi-structured interview is \n\nconducted to the respective teacher, in each class. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n\n \n\n 11\u00ba degree in Biology and Geology \n\nAzambuja Secondary School \n\nDate 7 March 2018 \n\nNumber of Students 17 students \n\nClassroom typology Informatic classroom with available 12 computers for \n\nmost students (11 students in a computer and three groups, \n\neach with 2 students, sharing one computer) \n\nDuration  1h30: starts at 8h30 a.m. until 10h00 a.m. \n\nTable 4 - Typology of secondary classroom \n\nBefore sharing the prototype, the author asked the class to identify the oldest \n\nbotanical garden in Portugal. It was verified that the group did not know the Ajuda botanical \n\ngarden, but some mentioned the botanic garden from MUNHAC \u2013 Museums of the \n\nUniversity of Lisbon20. The observation of the contents happened without problem, early in \n\nthe morning the access to the Internet was optimal the students could observe and try the \n\ncontents proposed, in the indicated order. Afterwards, they were asked to respond to the 2 \n\nquestionnaires available in the respective 2 links of the site (the general questionnaire and the \n\nSUS questionnaire). After this procedure, the class took an interval of about 10 minutes. \n\nAfter the break, the second session was held where the exploratory tree design was proposed. \n\nEach student received 2 post-it of different color to write, according to their vision, a possible \n\ncause and respective solution in relation to the Blindness Botany problem. \n\nDuring the first session, in the observation of the prototype, the author observed in \n\nthe students an enthusiasm related to the botanical games, an enthusiasm also verified by the \n\nteacher of the class who commented this detail with her and that will be more detailed in the \n\ndiscussion section. \n\nBefore and after the evaluation-test phase with this classroom, the author talked \n\ninformally with the teacher about the main idea associated with the project, and later, in the \n\n                                                           \n20 Available in: http://www.museus.ulisboa.pt/en/botanic-garden \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\n \n\nsame day, sent him a semi-structured interview, being the results shared in the result\u00b4s \n\ninterviews section. \n\n Master in New Media and Journalism \n\nFCSH - New University of Lisbon \n\nDate 8 March 2018 \n\nNumber of Students 33 students \n\nClassroom typology Auditorium 3 of FCSH \u2013 NOVA, without computers \n\navailable, students use their smartphones or laptops \n\nDuration  1h00: starts at 06h00 p.m. until 07h00 p.m. \n\nTable 5 - Typology of master\u2019s classroom \n\nIn this group it was also verified that the students did not know about the oldest \n\nbotanical garden in Portugal, some of them also referred the botanic garden from \n\nMUHNAC. The process was similar in methodology, although some differences as: \n\n\u2022 The students were not all present at the beginning of the class, despite most were in \n\nthe room after the introduction and the author reinforced the purpose of the session \n\nduring the process \n\n\u2022 The room was an auditorium, with no computers available and therefore students \n\nobserved the contents on their smartphones or laptops, with the limitations of \n\nInternet access that occurred during the event. In any case, the author projected the \n\ncontents to the class and explained the associated proposals, with text, images and \n\nsounds \n\n\u2022 Session duration was shorter and without interval \n\n\u2022 Related to the first group, the class was not so homogeneous in terms of age and \n\nacademic background, formed by students with varied training such as journalism, \n\nmedicine, new media \n\nAt the end of this test phase was the interval, and the class continued later with the \n\nrespective teacher. The author combined with the teacher that the semi-structured interview \n\nwould be sent via email. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\n \n\n4.2 Results  \n\nConsidering the research questions (RQ) associated with this project, results are \n\nshared in one order. First, are summarized the main results obtained in the pilot \n\nquestionnaire about botanical gardens in Portugal. Then, the results achieved with the \n\nobservation of the prototype and the answers of the two questionnaires, which are mostly \n\nrelated with RQ1 and RQ3, are shared. Finally, the results obtained in Focus Group \n\nclassrooms and in the semi-structured interviews with respective teachers are disclosed, more \n\nrelated to RQ2 and RQ4. \n\n \n\n4.2.1 Results obtained in the pilot questionnaire about botanical \n\ngardens in Portugal \n\nWere obtained 293 results and only 73 persons correctly answered the question: \n\n\u201cWhat is the name of the first botanical garden in Portugal?\u201d. Responses like \u201cLisbon \n\nbotanical garden\u201d were not considered correct because in Lisbon there are three different \n\nbotanical gardens. Answers like \u201cAjuda\u201d, \u201cRoyal botanical garden\u201d and \u201cAjuda sidewalk \n\ngarden\u201d were considered correct. 78,8% of the participants have a higher academic \n\nqualification, 32.4% with postgraduate and master's degrees and another 32.4% with a \n\ndoctorate, the dominant age group (59,8%) being between the ages of 30 and 59 years (10,6% \n\nof participants are between 18 and 20 years). Full results can be seen at this link21. \n\nOnly 32,4% of people correctly answered the question relative to the foundation time \n\nof Ajuda botanical garden (JBA), in the second half of the 18th century. The creation of the \n\nfirst botanical garden in Portugal was driven by the combination of scientific knowledge, \n\ntechnical know-how and political power, and 36,9% recognized this combination even \n\nthough 36,5% emphasize the scientific knowledge as the main cause. \n\n47% knew the city where JBA was founded (Lisbon), although 30,4% answered that \n\nthey didn\u00b4t know and 21,8% responded that it was in Coimbra. In relation to the European \n\ncountry, officially considered the place where the first botanical gardens were established \n\n(Italy), 18,4% knew it. The frank majority, 92,5%, recognize botanical gardens as scientific \n\nmuseums but 52,9% don\u00b4t have the habit of visiting them. 74,8% considered that botanical \n\ngardens have an important role to play in the promotion of cultural and leisure activities for \n\ncitizens. In relation to the frequency with which they visit the botanical gardens in Portugal, \n\n                                                           \n21 Available in: \nhttps://xploredesign4scicomm.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/questionariopiloto_jardinsbotanicosportu\ngueses.pdf \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\n \n\nfor cultural and leisure activities, 49.1% of participants said that they rarely visit, 33.1% \n\noccasionally, 13% never visit, and only 4,8% visit frequently, at least once monthly.  \n\n \n\n4.2.2 Results achieved with the observation of the prototype and \n\nresponses to the general and SUS questionnaires, in both groups \n\nGroup 1: 11-year class in Biology and Geology \n\n\u2022 Answers regarding the general questionnaire \n\nOf the total of 17 students who observed the prototype, 5 girls and 9 boys, 14 \n\nanswered the online questionnaire, available at this link22. The participants' ages ranged from \n\n15 to 18 years (15 - 14.3%, 16 - 42.9%, 17 - 28.6% and 18 - 14.3%).

He considered the approach \n\nof this project interesting, emphasizing the virtual contents as a complement of great utility, \n\nbefore, during and after physical visits. Considering \u201cplant blindness\u201d as a problem, \n\nEdmundo Martins said: \u201cIn fact, we suffer several blindness including plant blindness, the \n\nknowledge transmitted in the school are a little encyclopedic, very turned to histology and \n\nplant physiology, with many names to decorate and very little turned to the observation, \n\ndiscovery and effective knowledge of flora that surrounds us.

In relation to traditional \n\naudiovisual media, he thinks they are not sufficient interactive but to implement more \n\ninteractivity in classrooms there are some limitations in technological resources that can limit \n\nthese approach, as availability and speed of the internet and appropriate classroom conditions \n\nfor this purpose. \n\nHe considered relevant the concept that has been tested. Confirmed that the use of \n\nthe proposal can add value to his activity as a teacher, without losing scientific rigor. It can \n\nmotivate one future visit to Ajuda botanical garden and the i-doc\u00b4s utilization can be useful \n\nduring one visit or help to consolidate the concepts in the post-visit and even, allows \n\nautonomous research paths. \n\nRegarding the questions below, Edmundo Martins replied: \n\n- In your opinion, can this strategy contribute to a greater involvement of students \n\nin botany and related sciences? Edmundo Martins: \u201cYes, in general as a strategy and \n\nparticularly with disaffected students, with little interest, as can be verified during the session, \n\nin which generally uninterested students were enthusiastic about the games.\u201d \n\n- In your view, could the i-doc format be of greater use to individual or collective \n\nstudents? Do you have any suggestions? Edmundo Martins: \u201cAs an autonomous learning \n\npath more individually, it can be used in teacher-directed research activities at the collective \n\nlevel.\u201d \n\n- Is the choice of the support to be used to communicate science conditioned by the \n\ncomplexity of the subject matter and by the degree of knowledge and information demand \n\nof the public (considering mediation between text and audiovisual)? Edmundo Martins: \n\n\u201cDepending on the characteristics of the subject, the most adequate resources are used to \n\nacquire content and the existing means. In the case of a botanical garden where a transversal \n\napproach to the different cycles is possible, the learning pathways must be adapted to the \n\ndifferent levels of education.\u201d \n\n - In your opinion, are marked differences between the audiovisual narrative and the \n\nscientific narrative that condition the transposition process? Edmundo Martins: \u201cNo, they \n\n\n\n \n\n46 \n\n \n\nare partners, both the audiovisual and scientific narratives are facilitators of learning and \n\nsource of motivation.\u201d \n\nEdmundo considers interesting the future promotion of this concept among students \n\nand teachers, creating conditions in the school to produce new experiences in an autonomous \n\nway, promoting education for the media and enriching school contents. But it would be very \n\nimportant to have more adequate rooms and to have one intermediary in the process, that \n\nfacilitates the process. One specialized agent who could produce personalized contents, \n\narticulating the content to be taught with teachers. It could facilitate because it is difficult for \n\nteachers to monitor technological development and there is a lack of training in that field. \n\nMultimedia students could be involved in the process (multimedia teachers and other \n\nprofessionals could be partners in content development). \n\n\u2022 Interview with master\u00b4s classroom teacher: \n\nAnt\u00f3nio Granado, teacher of master\u00b4s class, answered similar questions to those put \n\nto the teacher of group 1, focusing Science Communication and Journalism. Below are three \n\nquestions, the same put to Edmundo, with the respective answers and then some \n\nconsiderations that he pointed out about the proposal of this project: \n\n- In your opinion, can this strategy contribute to a greater involvement of students \n\nin botany and related sciences? \u2013 Ant\u00f3nio Granado: \u201cThere is no doubt that the observation \n\nof the prototype can contribute to the students' involvement with the JBA and Botany. I \n\nthink the idea will be more interesting from the point of view of education than from the \n\npoint of view of the journalist, just observing the prototype. The project will be useful to \n\nproduce news about it, but is not possible to do a story or news about the JBA without going \n\nthere in person. It will be interesting if the journalist goes to the garden space and then, \n\nhimself develops the contents. As for the greater involvement of students I have no doubt, \n\nnow for the journalist to observe this format, I have doubts, he can report this event, but as \n\na producer, will always be limited to what was filmed, photographed, he only sees what \n\nsomeone has already created. But, if he applies this model, that approach contributes to the \n\njournalist being able to breathe life into his voice in a different way, and in this perspective, \n\nthe proposed i-doc will be interesting for the journalist. \u201c \n\n- Is the choice of the support to be used to communicate science conditioned by the \n\ncomplexity of the subject matter and by the degree of knowledge and information demand \n\nof the public (considering mediation between text and audiovisual)? Ant\u00f3nio Granado: \u201cIn \n\nScience Communication is crucial adapting the message to the support that we use. For each \n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n\n \n\nmedium the speech must be adapted. Some concepts and ideas may work best for text or \n\nvideo, for example. Even orally, we must adapt our speech to the number of listeners or to \n\nthe space where we are. People are very accustomed to communicating by text and there is \n\ndifficulty in transposing to the audiovisual media, but it depends on the message to be \n\ntransmitted, the text can even complicate when used in excess, which still happens frequently \n\nin some presentations. The process of scientific communication should be a process of \n\nsimplifying information, appropriate to the target audience, and simplifying does not mean \n\nloss of rigor.\u201d \n\n - In your opinion, are marked differences between the audiovisual narrative and the \n\nscientific narrative that condition the transposition process? Ant\u00f3nio Granado: \u201cTo \n\ncommunicate, as the origin of the word indicates, is to put something in common, and I \n\nthink that in this sense it is possible to simplify. To talk about more complex botanical \n\nconcepts with doctorates, for example in nuclear physics or law, we should simplify. It will \n\nnot be a matter of academic degree, but language can and should be simplified. Accuracy is \n\nvery important, and in the communicative process this detail, and the ability to achieve it, are \n\ntransversal and vital in all areas, and I think simplification is compatible with rigor. We can \n\nremember Stephen Hawking, in this context.\u201d \n\nIn relation to the idea that one i-doc can be interpreted as a builder and enabler of \n\nknowledge, Ant\u00f3nio Granado said that when we produce any journalistic product, whether \n\nin text or images, there is always a construction of knowledge, being that fact the interest of \n\njournalism, helping to take certain themes to the society. Mixing various contents in one i-\n\ndoc, such as games for example, and stimulating interaction with them, can facilitate the \n\ninterplay of the message and the application of knowledge, more easily than just reading a \n\nstory. There is a difference between reading and applying knowledge, and he believes that \n\nthis format might enhance that application and enable the diffusion of knowledge. \n\nAnt\u00f3nio Granado also pointed out limitations associated with the project\u00b4s concept: \n\n\u201cThe time required and associated costs are limiting. There is no time to think about new \n\nformats. Journalism has been a repetition of information from someone who has already \n\nproduced, and this reality limits the production of that format. Clearly, we need new content \n\nthat stimulates people's attention. Currently, in relation to the situation that many newsrooms \n\nare currently suffering, there is hardly a bet on the production of this format. It would be \n\nimportant to do more experiments of this type, some are made, but they are not enough. \n\nThe production of a format with this type of interaction will be a time-consuming process \n\nand requires appropriate teams, and the newsrooms have been shrinking brutally for many \n\n\n\n \n\n48 \n\n \n\nyears. There is not enough time or resources for this kind of productions. And another \n\nimportant issue for the managers and administrators of social media: \"What will be the profit \n\nwith this format? How many clicks and how many people will be interested in this format?\". \n\nBets are currently experimental. And remembered that: \u201cUniversity is the only place where \n\nthere is time to explore these new formats and there are not profit pressures. Proofs of \n\nconcept can be useful to demonstrate the usefulness in using these formats, but external \n\nsupport will always be necessary, considering the financial limitations\u201d.  \n\nAbout the importance of design to the planning of communicative relations between \n\npeople and emerging digital objects, Ant\u00f3nio Granado said: \u201cDesign is not just the shape, \n\nbecause without a defined function it will have no use. The projects can be very appealing \n\nbut if they are not suitable for a purpose, respecting the function they propose, they lose \n\nusefulness. Planning is thus essential. A prototype is not as fluid as a finalized product, but I \n\nthink the simulated multimodality in this project is interesting.\u201d \n\n4.2.4 Results obtained in Focus Group classrooms \n\nEach group draw an \u201cexploratory tree\u201d, with problems - the possible causes of plant \n\nblindness - and solutions - paths or ways that can minimize that problem - the problems \n\nbeing the roots and the solutions branches of the tree, where the trunk is the plant blindness. \n\nThe respective trees, tree 1 (11-year classroom) and tree 2 (master\u00b4s classroom), can be \n\nobserved below. \n\n\u2022 Tree 1 - 11-year classroom \n\nThe problems and solutions, written by the 17 students in the post-it, were grouped \n\ntogether in main themes to facilitate the understanding of the tree. Next to each is a number, \n\nwhich reflects the number of students who indicated the problem / solution (some students \n\nwrote more than one problem or solution in the post-it). It was not considered in the tree, a \n\npost-it problem of a participant, because what was written did not fit in the subjects referred \n\nin collective, but is considered the register of that opinion, in relation to a possible problem: \n\n\"You should not interact too much with the technology otherwise you can lose the notion \n\nof life. \".

To bet on the communication, formation, dissemination and awareness of this \n\ntheme, for society in general, not only in the school context but for the different age groups, \n\nwas a transversal way to most of the students. Three students specified that this theme is of \n\nlittle expression in the media and that a possible way would be to create, in the organs of \n\nsocial communication, a fixed and exclusive category on botany, betting on a greater \n\ndissemination with informative videos, an example given by one of them.  \n\nAnother view that stood out from the majority was the lack of training of government \n\npersonnel and ministries in this area and that, one possible way would be that given the \n\ninherent responsibility and decision-making power, these people should comply with the \n\nrequirement to have training in the environmental area. One participant linked climate \n\nchange to botanical blindness and the general perception that the negative consequences are \n\ngeographically distant, and identified a possible pathway such as identifying the negative \n\nconsequences already present in the local reality in a differentiating way and disseminating \n\nthese contents, adapted to each locality.  \n\n\n\n \n\n50 \n\n \n\nGiven the size of this group, the number of students who indicated the problems / \n\nsolutions was not indicated, since many of them used different words to represent the same \n\nproblems and solutions, with only 3 students who focused on the specific problem: the lack \n\nof dissemination of the topic in the media.

According to this scenario, the research questions (RQ) are answered by the author's \n\ninterpretation and proposals for improvement are addressed. An analysis grid is presented \n\nwith the strengths and points to be improved in upcoming actions. The concepts of \n\ninteractivity, immersiveness and participation are framed within this work and the \n\ntransdisciplinary associated with design is strengthened. \n\nFrom the results obtained in the pilot questionnaire on botanical gardens in Portugal, \n\nthe author emphasizes the recognition by the participants of the botanical gardens as \n\nscientific museums and spaces with an important function in the cultural dynamization and \n\nleisure activities for the citizens. However, they do not manifest a habit of visiting these \n\nspaces, doing so occasionally and even rarely. In the context of her work, the author believes \n\nthat the botanical gardens, with focus on Ajuda botanical garden (JBA), can improve their \n\ncommunication and cultural offer, contributing to their greater recognition and social \n\nimportance. In the results obtained, most participants did not know how to identify the JBA \n\nas the first Portuguese botanical garden. As this space is a national reference it will be \n\npertinent to consider new communicative approaches to increase it social recognition and \n\npromote actions that try to minimize the problem of botanical blindness. This was a pilot \n\nquestionnaire and the author thinks that it will be interesting to develop new investigations \n\nin this scope, with greater detail and dimension, that can contribute to a better knowledge of \n\nthis reality, since there is little academic work in this area. \n\nIn general, considering the results obtained in the proof of concept, the author \n\nconsiders the results as positive, since most of the answers and considerations obtained in \n\nthe questionnaires, interviews and focus group, validate the concept of this project, in terms \n\nof interest and practical utility, focusing on the educational context and promoting greater \n\nenvironmental awareness. The author also thinks that the results are promoters of a new \n\nlook not only for productive practices and technics, in science communication, but also, and \n\nspecifically, in educational practices, at different academic levels. \n\nRegarding the interactivity interpretation related to the proposed digital object, the \n\nauthor, in addition to using storytelling, sought to create and draw experiences for an \n\naudience as active as possible, in the sense of: \u201cInteractivity refers to ability of a system to \n\npartake in the process of interaction. When this refers to communication, a key aspect is the \n\nfact that the passive viewer or reader of traditional media is replaced by an active user; an \n\n\n\n \n\n52 \n\n \n\nentity with agency. The way this agency affects the reception of the work or the work itself \n\nis widely varied. And while interactivity is intrinsic to digital media, one can argue that not all \n\nof our experiences with it are really interactive, according to the definition below.\u201d (Soler-\n\nAdillon, 2017, p. 5). The author's view of the participation she made for her target audience \n\ntook into consideration a form of social interaction, according to the same mentioned \n\nauthors, the fact that: \u201cAlthough some authors conflate it with interactivity, it is very useful \n\nto differentiate both concepts. While interaction always implies some sort of participation, \n\nthis is a pertinent distinction in order to frame the different types of activities that can take \n\nplace with technological systems that afford that the users take action in relation to them. It \n\nis especially relevant in the context of the web 2.0 and social media, where user generated \n\ncontent is central. The proposal here is to understand participation as contribution: That is, \n\nthe creating content by the user of the system, as a different act than that of interacting with \n\nthis content.\u201d (Soler-Adillon, 2017, p. 5). As for the notion of immersion, it was very useful \n\nfor the author, the contribution of the same authors in pages 5 and 6, when they show the \n\ndifferentiation of the spatial / technological immersion of the emotional / psychological \n\nimmersion that can be better understood in this sharing: \u201c(\u2026) it is not so much the tech-\n\nnology but the engagement that generates immersion. Playing a game in a very small screen, \n\nor a monitor a few meters away can be as immersive as using a Virtual Reality headset, if we \n\nunderstand immersion as this psychological loss of awareness of our immediate \n\nsurroundings.\u201d. \n\nIn relation to RQ1 and RQ3, the main annotations developed by the author are \n\nbelow: \n\n\u2022 RQ1: Can the proposal for the multimedia hybrid be a valid medium to promote \n\nawareness for plant blindness and science education?  \n\n\u2022 RQ3: Does the observation of the hybrid contribute to inform and alert to the \n\nimportance of botanical gardens, particularly to the recognition of the JBA?  \n\nIn both groups of the two different academic levels, a positive affirmation was \n\nverified to these question, since most of the students involved agreed with the key questions \n\nincluded in the two respective questionnaires, confirming that: the observation of the \n\nprototype helped to get to know the botanical garden of Ajuda and the proposal associated \n\nwith the project may contribute to a greater involvement with Botany and related sciences, \n\npromoting the importance of botanical gardens in that sense. In the two interviews \n\n\n\n \n\n53 \n\n \n\nconducted to the respective teachers, according to the answers obtained and the shared \n\nconsiderations, both opinions were favorable to the two research questions above. \n\nIn secondary classroom, the majority confirm that i-doc is a format which adds value \n\nto develop innovative content, complementing the classes of botany and associated sciences \n\nand facilitating the understanding of the curricular contents. Everyone enjoyed the \n\nexperience. Most strongly agreed that they would like to do other experiences of this kind in \n\nclasses, in this and other disciplines, emphasizing the premise that supplementing classes \n\nwith interactive audiovisual content (360 videos, RV, RA) will be stimulating and motivating \n\nfor learning. The author views the enthusiasm of the students with some reservations. To \n\nunderstand how the format i-doc can promote awareness for plant blindness and science \n\neducation, will be necessary to deepen the study, since is not exempt from controversy. The \n\nauthor thinks that there is no doubt that the observation of her prototype contributes to get \n\nto know Ajuda botanical garden but, to affirm that the proposal can be efficient to improve \n\nthe learning of curricular contents is needed more evidences. Still, there is a resistance \n\nregarding the use of Gamification, the critics argue that it undermines the focus on study and \n\nlearning and not promote the success that is promised (Orlandi, Duque, Mori, &amp; Orlandi, \n\n2018). These authors also mention the greater need for research. \n\n In the master\u2019s class, where the test was more focused on journalistic activity, was \n\nrecognized that interactive documentary rather than just being a media or digital media \n\nchannel, which represents reality, can be interpreted as a builder and enabler of knowledge \n\nand could be one valuable tool to develop innovative content that promotes differentiating \n\nand multidisciplinary journalism. However, the author does not neglect the fact that, from \n\nthe total of 20 participants, 5 students expressed a neutral opinion and 1 student did not \n\nagree with the use of i-doc in in journalistic differentiation, which indicates that it will be \n\nimportant to perceive this reality, in a more detailed way and with better questionnaires. The \n\nauthor thinks that, given the greater maturity of the master class, the results show a less \n\nenthusiasm associated and a more critical look about the proposal, which is revealing the \n\nneed for further research. On the other hand, the author believes that is one evidence that \n\nthe students can be skeptics to new approaches that involve adaptation or reorganization in \n\ntheir routines and habits. But it is necessary to investigate in a more targeted way. Efforts \n\nhave been made to journalists attempting to think and act like web designers. Journalism \n\nstudents, in general, are used to telling stories in a traditional way (headline, beginning, \n\nmiddle, end) and doing it in a different way requires a different planning. It will be imperative \n\n\n\n \n\n54 \n\n \n\nto become more engaged with new media design platforms and nowadays, forward-thinking \n\neducators are beginning to focus on the creation of i-docs (Gyori &amp; Charles, 2017). \n\nThe reference value for the SUS questionnaire is 68, and below this value it is a sign \n\nthat the usability is reduced or that it should be improved (Teixeira, 2015). The SUS obtained \n\nin the 11-year class is around 74 and in the master\u2019s class it is below 68, obtaining an \n\napproximate value of 63. This difference of usability in the two classes is interesting to \n\nanalyze. The author considers that evaluating the usability of something that is not yet \n\nmaterialized is difficult and subject to error, either by the transmitter of the idea or by the \n\nreceiver and interpreter. As Fabricio Teixeira highlights27, SUS can be applied to test \n\nproducts, services, hardware, software, websites and any type of interface.  The tested \n\nprototype, is a first iteration with the target audience, from the initial idea to its development, \n\napproximating what is proposed and expected to be performed, and therefore there is an \n\nassociated limitation. That is why was very important to choose to apply different procedures \n\nthroughout the work, trying to find patterns or differences in opinions. The author thinks \n\nthat the fact that masters class did not interact as much with the prototype\u00b4s contents as the \n\nsecondary school group did, mainly due to the limitations of Internet access and shorter \n\nduration of the event, contributed to the difference obtained at the SUS level. In addition, in \n\nthe demonstrative production of the contents, despite the author tried to have a general \n\napproach, there was a greater focus on the curricular contents of the 11th grade class which \n\nmay have influenced the results. But to clarify these details it would be necessary to move \n\nforward in the iteration and to materialize a new test phase, more directed and specific to \n\neach group. And with a better prototyping, more functional. \n\nIn any case, the author considers the SUS results encouraging, indicating that the \n\noverall purpose has been achieved, at this initial phase, although improvements must be \n\nmade in future. The results obtained are valid in the context in which they were obtained and \n\ngiven the reduced sample involved, they cannot be generalized. The author considers that it \n\nwill be of extreme importance to replicate new studies with this approach, with structured \n\nand transdisciplinary teams, and it is necessary to deepen the theme in a systematic study to \n\nobtain more specific results.  \n\nIn relation to RQ2 and RQ4, the main annotations developed by the author are: \n\n                                                           \n27 Available in: https://measuringu.com/sus/ \n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n\n \n\n\u2022 RQ2: What added value and constraints are created with multimedia hybrid format \n\nwhen addressing plant blindness, in the context of this project? \n\nConsidering one constraint that was pointed out from one student, in 11-year \n\nclassroom - that we should not interact too much with the technology otherwise we can lose \n\nthe notion of life \u2013 the author wants to highlight that the main purpose of this study is to \n\nresearch how technology can be a valuable medium to establish connections between online \n\nand offline world, that is, considers the use of technology as a facilitator of a responsible \n\ndialogue and promoter of a greater social awareness about the importance of Botany as a \n\nsocio-economic and environmental resource, which cannot be underestimated. As Jane \n\nMcGonigal remembers in the conclusions of her book \u201cReality is Broken \u2013 Why Games \n\nMake Us Better and How They Can Change the World\u201d the primary functions of games are: \n\n\u201cto provide real positive emotions, real positive experiences, and real social connections \n\nduring a difficult time.\u201d  And so, the author think is possible, with all the involved socio-\n\ntechnological challenges, to promote that dynamic in education context. \n\nIn a medium as plural as the Internet, there are also more and more threats to \n\ncredible, reliable communication. Anyone can produce and disseminate content in this \n\necosystem. The author argues, in this sense, the need to create conditions and ensure \n\ntechnical and human resources that can ensure a normalization, in the future even be able to \n\ncertification, in the use and dissemination of the i-doc format in science communication. In \n\nthe Portuguese case, there is a manual of good design practices for journalism applied in \n\nwebdocumentary28, which resulted from a master's work (A. d. L. C. da Rocha, 2017), and is \n\na relevant contribution from the perspective of the author, stimulating reflections and new \n\nactions in this field.  \n\nOther constraints were annoted in the interviews with the respective professors, like \n\nthe need for more adequate classrooms, better equipped and with better access to the \n\nInternet, and on the other hand, the lack of time and the weak specific training of teachers \n\nin this field. Ant\u00f3nio Granado concerned the time required and associated costs associated \n\nto one project like this work. Pointed out the fact that external financial support will always \n\nbe necessary to implement it. \n\nIn relation to the value added by the proposal associated with this project, the author \n\nrecalls the two drawn trees, obtained in the focus group of the two groups, and considers \n\n                                                           \n28 Available in: https://paginas.fe.up.pt/~up201109749/manual_boas_praticas/index.html \n\n\n\n \n\n56 \n\n \n\nthem the highest value that she can discern in this phase of the project: the voice of her target \n\naudience. The author considers that the results in both questionnaires and interviews \n\nreinforce the premises that were the founding roots of the objectives outlined in this project. \n\nAnd, in this perspective, despite the associated limitations, the author considers that the \n\naction-research was aggregator and opened horizons for other studies.  \n\nThe author argue that the concept of the project can be useful for science education \n\nand communication, being necessary to adapt to a target audience and specific objectives. \n\nMultimedia objects may facilitate the understanding of complex problems as they offer \n\ndifferent information that can be used in layers, according to the needs and choices of users. \n\nUsers that are active agents in the communicative process. One constraint that appears with \n\nnon-linear narratives is in relation to the issue of authorship, but that detail is not relevant in \n\nthis work, because the author defined since the beginning the possibilities of interaction and \n\nparticipation for her users.  \n\nThe author also thinks that it will be interesting to explore the i-doc within the \n\nframework of institutional scientific communication, in a creative way that can stimulate \n\npublic interest. \n\n\u2022 RQ4: What are the main causes of \u201cplant blindness\u201d and which effects it can cause, \n\nparticularly in the regular teaching of botany and associated sciences? \n\nThe students not only identify causes of the plant blindness problem, but also \n\nindicated possible ways of minimizing it. In two different events and with participants with \n\ndemarcated socio-demographic characteristics, causes and possible solutions were pointed \n\nout, some converging in both groups. The lack of investment and appreciation of the subject, \n\nnot only financially but also in terms of human resources, was common to both groups. The \n\nfact that it is a complex problem and does not have solutions that are easy to reach in the \n\nshort term is another problem that the author underlines in the results. The need for greater \n\ndissemination of issues associated with botany and its importance in economic and social \n\nterms has been emphasized, as well as greater emphasis on training, not only in academic \n\nsettings. In the context of the 11-year class, the students' willingness to participate in more \n\ndynamic classes that promote autonomy and greater responsibility was evident, which \n\nreinforces the author's opinion regarding the need to implement, with greater assiduity and \n\ncontinuity, educative practices in inquiry-based approaches, using innovative tools and \n\nstimulating Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI). \n\n\n\n \n\n57 \n\n \n\nBelow, is an overview analysis table, which resulted from a reflection by the author, \n\nwith the strengths and points to be improved in upcoming actions: \n\nXploreDesign4SciComm\n\nStrenghts Improvements\n\nRelevance of the Proposal for Society Refine the Approach\n\nOriginal Empirical Contribution\n\nPotencial to Implement the Idea\n\nImprove Prototyping\n\nPartnerships and Funding\n\nMore targeted ActionsVariety of Results\n\nTime Management\n\nApplication of Knowledge Transdisciplinary Team\n\nBetter Use of Technology\n\n \n\nTable 8 - Analysis table of the work project \n\n \n\nThe simplicity or complexity of multimodality used in interactive systems should be \n\nadapted to the context and objectives. The author believes that simplicity, in some contexts, \n\nmay be even more beneficial, but only by experimenting and testing, in a consistent and \n\nsystematic way, so that we can get to know its potentialities. Isolated and time-separated \n\nactions will not be productive, in her view, and it is imperative to follow the maturity of the \n\nmarket, to monitor technology and its potential, for the well-being of society. \n\nTo refine the prototype, it would be important to perform a heuristic analysis with \n\nspecialists, based on the 10 heuristics of Nielsen, to verify and improve the effectiveness and \n\nefficiency of the proposed interfaces and dynamics. \n\nIn the feedback that the author received from several colleagues with whom she \n\nshared her prototype, many were the opinions and suggestions. The choice of platforms to \n\ndevelop was one of the key factors, as it greatly influences the software to be used so that it \n\nis possible to express the dynamics proposed in the various interfaces. The limitation \n\nassociated with the functionalities of the chosen platforms was another point, especially the \n\nfree versions. The improvement of a more functional prototype was another tip to consider, \n\nan also the refinement of questionnaires. Attention to the quality and design of sound is \n\nanother vital factor in defining such a project. \n\nThe author applied her knowledge, had to make several decisions during the process \n\nand this approach reinforced her skills. There are no perfect formulas and the ideas to be \n\n\n\n \n\n58 \n\n \n\nimplemented should go step by step, in an iterative process. The implementation of an idea \n\nis always a difficult phase, but not impossible. A very useful feedback and that the author \n\nwas very pleased to receive from her colleague Jos\u00e9 Maia, because it was an indicator that he \n\nunderstood the concept of this project, was this sharing: \u201cI read your project, I think it is \n\nambitious without doubt, but I remind you that the timing for a project of a master's degree \n\nis very short. Thus, a project of this size should be implemented in phases, addressed as a \n\npizza, primarily the basis, solid and functional, and then, gradually, the ingredients.\u201d. \n\n\u201cThere is a lack of a global and transdisciplinary understanding of design in order for \n\nBonsieppe's (1992) omen to become reality: design as the fundamental new discipline of the \n\n21st century, replacing mathematics with the transdisciplinary and foundational role it has \n\nhad in science since the 17th century\u201d (da Silva Vieira, 2018, p. 102). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n59 \n\n \n\n Future Work \n\nThe author considers, according to research developed by several authors referred \n\nthroughout this work, that the results of her work are consistent with the lines of action, \n\npremises and arguments presented in the theoretical section. There are no static formulas, \n\nand the interactive documentary format, alone, will not work miracles, but, without \n\nexperimentation, without auscultation, we will not have results that can reinforce, or refute, \n\nthe premises and arguments associated with this communication proposal. To stimulate \n\nautonomy, critic thinking and ability to realize ideas and projects, it is necessary to give \n\nconditions and invest, and nowadays both in the education sector and journalism sector, the \n\ntime factor is a valuable resource, beyond the limitations, not only financial, that persist in \n\nthe two areas of activity. \n\nIn education, timetables, curriculum contents and objectives of students and teachers \n\nare often not consistent with the changes that are desired. How will it be possible to introduce \n\nnew dynamics, enhancing improvements, if many schools and their players still find it \n\ndifficult to meet the current objectives? In Portugal, curricular flexibilization is a path that is \n\nbeing introduced to schools and it will be interesting to explore this option in the context of \n\nthis project, in future studies that the author hopes be able to develop. These two references29 \n\nreinforce the author\u00b4s perspective about the importance of storytelling in education. One \n\nanother consideration that the author wants to point is the National Cinema Plan (Plano \n\nNacional de Cinema)30 which have, in the author\u00b4s perspective, convergent objectives with \n\nher line of action associated to this project. The future of Education and Skills project31 and \n\nthe Portuguese project \"A Voz dos Alunos\"32 launched in November 2016, are realities that \n\nthe author considered in her research design. \n\nIn journalism, maximizing profit is another limiting factor when thinking about new \n\nforms of expression and communication. Journalistic contents that exploit interactivity and \n\nmultimodality by adding gameplay characteristics are still scarce, and so is one important field \n\nto explore, studying and creating links between theory and practice that can add value do this \n\nprofessional activity. The university can play a crucial role in establishing links between the \n\nacademic community and society, particularly with the journalistic industry. Exploring new \n\n                                                           \n29 Available in: https://www.labster.com/blog/storytelling-in-education/ \nhttps://www.labster.com/blog/how-science-teachers-can-use-storytelling/  \n30 Available in: http://www.dge.mec.pt/plano-nacional-de-cinema \n31 Available in: http://www.oecd.org/education/2030/ \n32 Available in: https://www.dn.pt/lusa/interior/projeto-a-voz-dos-alunos-permite-informacao-\n\nimportante-para-melhorar-sistema---ministro-8480128.html \n\n\n\n \n\n60 \n\n \n\nmeans of financing, in addition to advertising, according to the author is a way to consider, \n\nwhich can create conditions for more detailed studies and prove the viability and \n\nsustainability of these new emerging formats. If we do not change the status quo, we will \n\nhardly leave this \"monotonous wheel\" in which models of communication are repeated. Civil \n\nsociety can be involved in this process, being encouraged to express ideas and the issues that \n\nare considered urgent to clarify and communicate, in a more effective way. This project \n\nfocused its attention on the school community because it considers that it is extremely \n\nimportant to stimulate the critical sense and the responsibility of the students, the sooner the \n\nbetter. The challenges are immense, digital literacy and media literacy are not immediate \n\nsolutions, they can even bring more challenges as Danah Boyd33 alerts: \u201cIf we\u2019re not careful, \n\n\u201cmedia literacy\u201d and \u201ccritical thinking\u201d will simply be deployed as an assertion of authority \n\nover epistemology \u201c. In this scenario, the author reaffirms the need to explore and better \n\nunderstand different ways of building knowledge.  Although she is not a journalist, she \n\nconsiders, given her academic background and professional activity, that she can be \n\nintegrated into a multi and transdisciplinary team, and can act in a convergent and more \n\neffective way, within the framework proposed in this work. \n\nPartnering, crowdfunding or applying for European funds are alternatives to consider \n\nin the short term, that can accelerate the establishment of this project. Interactive \n\ndocumentary can improve awareness about social issues, there is a lack of use of this specific \n\nformat in science communication and is needed further investigation about that approach, \n\nto connect people to identity, memory and places and promote plural perspectives about one \n\nspecific subject (Casella, 2018). \n\nThe author feels motivated with the development of this work that considers to be a \n\nstructuring phase in her academic formation, concretely in Science Communication. This \n\nproject, in her view, is a stimulus to follow the PhD level, studying and deepening how \n\ntechnology and recent advances can contribute to the enrichment of educational practices, \n\nschool success and promotion of a more cohesive and responsible society, with focus on \n\nhuman centered design. \n\nIn the absence of an own definition and taxonomy established for the format of the \n\ninteractive documentary, the author thinks that it will be of great utility to study in more \n\ndepth what kind of interactivity that will best adapt to the context of regular education, in \n\nthe ambit of scientific education in Botany and associated sciences. The understanding of \n\n                                                           \n33 Available in: https://points.datasociety.net/you-think-you-want-media-literacy-do-you-7cad6af18ec2 \n\n\n\n \n\n61 \n\n \n\nthe immersion variable will be another detail to consider, since the author believes that \n\ndepending on the level of interactivity proposed, the associated immersion may have some \n\ncorrelation, as well as the success of the participation manifested by users, but at this stage it \n\nis only a possible line of research to consider. It will be of great importance to create \n\nconditions for articulating theory and practice in specific actions, that promote greater \n\nclarification of ambivalent concepts such as interaction, immersion, participation, among \n\nother. The author believes that the interactivity-immersion-participation triangle may be \n\ncommon to any proposed taxonomy, and that the combination of these three variables can \n\nbe an interesting contribution as a basis for analyzing possible combinations in a well-defined \n\ncontext and purpose, having as a reference the work developed by (Soler-Adillon, 2017). \n\nIn her meeting with DIFR, in relation to innovative communication proposals for \n\nAjuda botanical garden (JBA), two main lines of action were defined. Actions outside JBA: \n\nto carry out an urban intervention using technology, science and art in unexpected cities \n\nplaces, such as squares, subway exits and shopping centers. Several ideas emerged, such as \n\ncreating digital, physical and virtual micro-gardens, producing \u201clive infographics\u201d, such as \n\nassociating the age of a tree with remarkable periods of our national and / or international \n\nhistory, providing video mapping shows, using light to map existing plants or created \n\nvirtually. Another idea is to map green routes of the cities promoting challenges to the \n\ncitizens, invited them to explore a certain zone of one city and to realize objectives. Regarding \n\nactions inside JBA, alternatives such as the production of non-intrusive (transparent) displays \n\nwith sensors were considered and, after interaction of the visitors, some stimuli to be defined \n\nat the design stage, such as some contact or physical proximity, these displays react with \n\ndifferent types of information providing experiences beyond oral and written \n\ncommunication, as well as aural, haptic and kinetic experiences. \n\nEUROGARD VIII34 - Eight European Botanic Gardens Congress: \u201cBotanic \n\nGardens, People and Plants for a Sustainable World\u201d will occur in Lisbon in May 7th-11th, \n\n2018. Several themes will be highlighted since there is a huge need to develop and/or adapt \n\nbotanic gardens\u00b4 policies and practices.
